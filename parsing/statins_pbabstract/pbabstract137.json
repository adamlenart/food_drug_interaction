During the past 6 years three large, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of three different statins have been conducted in the dialysis population-but two of these studies did not demonstrate any benefits of statin therapy, and the third study showed only marginally positive results. To understand why statins have failed to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD, the basic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia in CKD must be critically examined. The observed negative results in the clinical trials of statin therapy might also reflect the biomarkers and targets that were chosen to be evaluated. The characteristics of dyslipidemia in patients with CKD not yet requiring dialysis treatment differ markedly from those of individuals with established ESRD and form the basis for therapeutic recommendations. The potential adverse effects associated with statin therapy are important to consider in the management of dyslipidemia in patients with CKD.", 
    "1": "It is known that deformation of red blood cells (RBCs) is linked to ATP release from the cells. Further, membrane cholesterol has been shown to alter properties of the cell membrane such as fluidity and bending stiffness. Membrane cholesterol content is increased in some cardiovascular diseases, for example, in individuals with acute coronary syndromes and chronic stable angina, and therefore, because of the potential clinical relevance, we investigated the influence of altered RBC membrane cholesterol levels on ATP release. Because of the correlation between statins and reduced membrane cholesterol in vivo, we also investigated the effects of simvastatin on RBC deformation and ATP release. We found that reducing membrane cholesterol increases cell deformability and ATP release. We also found that simvastatin increases deformability by acting directly on the membrane in the absence of the liver, and that ATP release was increased for cells with enriched cholesterol after treatment with simvastatin.",

    "6": "O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of serines/threonines on cytoplasmic proteins is a significant signal regulating cellular processes such as cell cycle, cell development, and cell apoptosis. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is responsible for the removal of O-GlcNAc, and it thus plays a critical role in O-GlcNAc metabolism. Interestingly, OGA can be cleaved by caspase-3 into two fragments during apoptosis, producing an N-terminal fragment (1-413 a.a.), termed nOGA. Here, using 4-MU-GlcNAc (4-methylumbelliferyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside) as substrate, we found that the nOGA fragment retains high glycosidase activity. To probe the role of nOGA in apoptosis, it is essential to develop a potent and specific nOGA inhibitor. However, many reported inhibitors active at nanomolar concentrations (including PUGNAc, STZ, GlcNAc-statin, and NAG-thiazoline) against full-length OGA were not potent for nOGA. Next, we screened a small triazole-linked carbohydrate library and first identified compound 4 (4-pyridyl-1-(2'-deoxy-2'-acetamido-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl)-1,2,3-triazole) as a potent and competitive inhibitor for nOGA. This compound shows 15-fold selectivity for nOGA (K(i) = 48 \u03bcM) over the full-length OGA (K(i) = 725 \u03bcM) and 10-fold selectivity over human lysosomal \u03b2-hexosaminidase A&B (Hex A&B) (K(i) = 502 \u03bcM). These results reveal that compound 4 can be used as a potent and selective inhibitor for probing the role of nOGA in biological systems.",

Diagnostic criteria for stent thrombosis have recently been updated with the time and probability of the event being considered as crucial parameters. To be considered as \"definite\", the diagnosis of stent thrombosis has to be confirmed by angiography or histology. This statement position has clearly rendered more difficult the clinical assessment of stent thrombosis in randomised clinical trials. Considering these limitations, stent thrombosis represents a dramatic complication for both patients and cardiologists. In coronary plaques, thrombosis is often associated with death, acute coronary syndromes and arrhythmias. For these reasons, the pharmacological improvement of this outcome represents a \"hot-topic\" field for research. Among several medications, statins have been shown to potentially reduce the incidence of coronary stent thrombosis in humans. However, randomised clinical trials focussing on \"definite\" diagnosis are still needed to confirm these promising results. In addition, the use of statins in patients implanted with stents in other arteries is largely unexplored. Finally, statin-eluting stents (only tested in pigs) have to be evaluated in other animal models and human beings. Therefore, a clear recommendation on the use of statins to prevent stent thrombosis is not available and caution should be used. The \"pleiotropic\" anti-atherosclerotic properties of statins might represent a crucial investigation field to pathophysiologically clarify the role of statins in stent complications.",

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) plays a central role in the process of adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitization, and also possesses anti-atherogenic effects. Recently, some statins, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers have been reported to activate PPAR\u03b3. However, the impact of PPAR\u03b3 activation on diabetic macrovascular complications is not fully understood. It has been reported that the activation of PPAR\u03b3 by thiazolidinediones induces anti-atherogenic effects in vascular cells, including monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, in atherosclerotic animal models and in clinical studies. We have reported that hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme\u2003A reductase inhibitors (statins), which are used for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, activate PPAR\u03b3 and mediate anti-atherogenic effects through PPAR\u03b3 activation in macrophages. Also, telmisartan, an angiotensin type I receptor blocker, has been reported to have anti-atherogenic effects through PPAR\u03b3 activation. Furthermore, we have reported that nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, can activate PPAR\u03b3, thereby mediating anti-atherogenic effects in macrophages. Therefore, statin therapy and part of anti-hypertensive therapy might produce beneficial effects through PPAR\u03b3 activation in hypercholesterolemic and/or hypertensive patients with diabetes, and PPAR\u03b3 might be a therapeutic target for diabetic macrovascular complications.

Patients with mild SLE can be treated with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and antimalarials. Corticosteroids, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide, remain important for long term management of most patients with active disease. In recent years, significant progress in molecular and cellular biology of SLE has resulted in a better characterization and understanding of the biology and prognosis of this disease. These achievements have provided new opportunities for the development of innovative, more effective, therapies. Novel agents potentially useful in the treatment of patients with SLE include tolerogens, monoclonal antibodies and other agents. Tolerogens are synthetic molecules that can bind and cross-link autoantibodies on reactive B-cell surface, promoting B-cell depletion or inactivity. An anti-DNA antibody based peptide, pCons, might have also therapeutic efficacy in SLE patients who are positive for anti-DNA antibodies. In addition, prasterone, a proprietary synthetic dehydroepiandrosterone product is under investigation for the treatment of SLE.

In this context, there is evidence indicating that statins decrease the excess risk for AMI and other CHD-related events in patients with CKD (although the benefit may depend on the stage of CKD).

Recently, Tregs were found to present in atherosclerotic lesions and play an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Statins have immunomodulatory properties, and the effect of statins on atherosclerosis depends in part on their immunomodulatory mechanisms. We sought to determine whether statins exhibit an effect on Tregs in atherosclerotic plaques and in peripheral circulation of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In an in vivo experiment, we induced atherosclerotic plaques in apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE\u207b/\u207b) mice. The mice were randomly divided into two groups for 6-wk treatment: simvastatin (50 mg/kg/d) or vehicle (control). Simvastatin significantly increased the number of Tregs and the expression of Treg marker Foxp3 (Forkhead/winged helix transcription factor), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and interleukin (IL)-10 in atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, simvastatin played an important role in modulating the balance between antiinflammatory (Tregs and Th2 cells) and proinflammatory (Th17 and Th1 cells) subsets of T cells. In an in vitro experiment, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from patients with ACS and incubated with simvastatin. After an incubation for 96 h, simvastatin significantly enhanced the frequency and functional suppressive properties of Tregs.

The study had a crossover design: after 3 months, both groups were changed (group A* stopped and group B* started atorvastatin treatment). Nitric oxide (NO), total antioxidant status (TAS), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and peroxide concentrations as well as FMD were measured before, after 3 and after 6 months of treatment. Atorvastatin added to existing treatment decreased BP in both groups.",

In patients with FMD improvement, there was a greater BP reduction. After treatment discontinuation, FMD significantly decreased (from 19.6 \u00b112.6% to 13.0 \u00b110.5%; p < 0.05), which was consistent with BP increase. Changes in FMD were not significantly related to the increase in NO and TAS concentrations and decrease in ET-1 and peroxides measurements.",

    "117": "The shear-responsive transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is a critical regulator of endothelial gene expression patterns induced by atheroprotective flow. As microRNAs (miRNAs) post-transcriptionally control gene expression in many pathogenic and physiological processes, we investigated the regulation of miRNAs by KLF2 in endothelial cells. KLF2 binds to the promoter and induces a significant upregulation of the miR-143/145 cluster. Interestingly, miR-143/145 has been shown to control smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypes; therefore, we investigated the possibility of transport of these miRNAs between endothelial cells and SMCs. Indeed, extracellular vesicles secreted by KLF2-transduced or shear-stress-stimulated HUVECs are enriched in miR-143/145 and control target gene expression in co-cultured SMCs. Extracellular vesicles derived from KLF2-expressing endothelial cells also reduced atherosclerotic lesion formation in the aorta of ApoE(-/-)\u00a0mice. Combined, our results show that atheroprotective stimuli induce communication between endothelial cells and SMCs through an miRNA- and extracellular-vesicle-mediated mechanism and that this may comprise a promising strategy to combat atherosclerosis.", 
    "118": "Saphenous vein grafts used in coronary artery bypass graft surgery suffer from lower patency rates compared to left internal mammary artery. A number of clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated a significant benefit of statin treatment on vein graft patency. Aside from their well-known lipid-lowering capacities, statins exert pleiotropic effects by direct inhibition of the mevalonate pathway in the wall of these grafts. This leads to reduced geranylgeranylation of small GTPases such as Rho and Rac. Through this LDL-independent mechanism, statins improve endothelial function and reduce vascular inflammation and oxidative stress, inhibiting also smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. Although the existing evidence supports a beneficial effect of statins on vein grafts biology, more clinical trials focused on the effect of aggressive statin treatment on vein graft patency are required, in order to safely translate this strategy into clinical practice.", 
    "119": "The dose-response of the pleiotropic effects of statins on airway inflammation has not yet been established and may differ from that of their cholesterol-lowering effects. High oral doses of statins may have adverse effects, and it may be possible to overcome the side effects and low clinical efficacy by administering statins via inhalation. In this study, we hypothesize that simvastatin is a potential anti-inflammatory drug with biological and pharmacokinetic properties suitable for delivery by the inhaled route. Mice were immunized with ovalbumin (OVA) and then challenged with aerosol OVA. Simvastatin was locally delivered by inhalation (i.h.) and intratracheal injection (i.t.) or systematically delivered by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) and gavage (i.g.) during the OVA challenge. In a mouse model of asthma, i.h. simvastatin significantly and dose-dependently attenuated airway inflammation, remodeling and hyperresponsiveness in a RhoA-dependent pathway. Upon comparing the pharmacodynamics, i.h. simvastatin had a more potent effect than that of i.g. and i.p. simvastatin, and the i.h. or i.t. delivery routes led to a higher drug concentration in local lung tissue and a lower drug concentration in the plasma than that obtained by the i.g. These results suggest that simvastatin is a potential anti-inflammatory drug for airway inflammatory diseases with properties suitable for delivery by inhalation, which will probably reduce the side effects and increase clinical efficacy.", 
    "120": "We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of combined treatment of A\u03b2-immunization with simvastatin in an Alzheimer mouse model at age 22 months. DNA prime-adenovirus boost immunization induced modest anti-A\u03b2 titers and simvastatin increased the seropositive rate. A\u03b2-KLH was additionally administered to boost the titers. Irrespective of simvastatin, the immunization did not decrease cerebral A\u03b2 deposits but increased soluble A\u03b2 and tended to exacerbate amyloid angiopathy in the hippocampus. The immunization increased cerebral invasion of leukocytes and simvastatin counteracted the increase. Thus, modest anti-A\u03b2 titers can increase soluble A\u03b2 and simvastatin may reduce inflammation associated with vaccination in aged Alzheimer mouse models.",

Evidence on the use of clopidogrel and prasugrel may be unfavourable but ticagrelor may be beneficial. In post CABG heart failure mixture of GIK, changing the cardioplegic solution and careful intra-operative management to reduce myocardial stunning may prove beneficial.

There are still no well-defined criteria for identification of individuals with HBD and there are few studies on the topic. Most studies demonstrate that overweight, male gender, black ethnic background, physical activity, calcium and fluoride intake and use of medications such as statins and thiazide diuretics play a relevant and positive role on bone mineral density. Moreover, it is known that individuals with certain diseases such as obesity, diabetes, estrogen receptor-positive breast or endometrial cancer have greater bone density than healthy individuals, as well as athletes having higher bone density than non-athletes does not necessarily mean that they have healthy bones. A better understanding of risk and protective factors may help in the management of patients with bone frailty and have applicability in the treatment and in the prevention of osteoporosis, especially intervening on non-modifiable risk factors.",

However, not all patients show regression of coronary atherosclerosis after statin therapy. The purpose of the present study was to identify differences in clinical characteristics, serum lipid profiles, arterial remodeling, and plaque composition between patients with progression and those with regression of coronary atherosclerosis during statin therapy. The effects of 8-month statin therapy on coronary atherosclerosis were evaluated in the Treatment With Statin on Atheroma Regression Evaluated by Intravascular Ultrasound With Virtual Histology (TRUTH) study using intravascular ultrasound-virtual histology. One hundred nineteen patients were divided into 2 groups according to atheroma volume increase (progressors) or decrease (regressors) during an 8-month follow-up period. Fifty-one patients (43%) were categorized as progressors and the remaining 68 (57%) as regressors. External elastic membrane volume increased, although not significantly (0.8%, p = 0.34), and luminal volume decreased significantly (-5.3%, p = 0.0003) in progressors, while external elastic membrane volume decreased significantly (-3.2%, p <0.0001) and luminal volume increased (2.2%, p = 0.13) in regressors. The fibrous component increased significantly in progressors, while this component decreased in regressors. A strong positive correlation was observed between change in atheroma volume and change in fibrous volume (r = 0.812, p <0.0001). In conclusion, coronary arteries showed negative remodeling during statin-induced plaque regression. The difference in plaque composition between patients with progression and those with regression of coronary atherosclerosis during statin therapy arose from the difference in the change in fibrous component.",

    "132": "Lipid lowering therapy with statins reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated LDL-independent action of this class of drugs, which appears in modulating endothelial function, inflammation and thrombosis. Periprocedural myocardial infarction and contrast induced nephropathy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), associated with worse outcome on short and long term follow-up, are both complications related to inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms. Randomized studies showed a beneficial effect of short-term statin pretreatment in reducing peri-procedural cardiac markers release in patients undergoing PCI. In fact, statin therapy before elective PCI reduced periprocedural myocardial infarction in patients with stable angina. Furthermore, an acute loading with high-dose atorvastatin prevented myocardial damage in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing early PCI (<48 hours). In patients already on chronic statin therapy, a reload with high dose statin was associated with a significant improvement on 30-day cardiac outcome. Finally, statin therapy at the time of PCI significantly decreased the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy. All these evidences support an \"upstream administration\" of short-term, high-dose statins in all patients undergoing PCI, in order to achieve pleiotropic, LDL-independent effects of these drugs.",

Atorvastatin and CMG were administered in ICR male mice with acute lipemia induced with a single injection of poloxamer 407 (P-407). A novel small-angle X-ray scattering method for the determination of fractional and subfractional composition of LP-C and LP-TG was used. In P-407-treated animals, there was a drastic increase of total cholesterol and especially TG. Atorvastatin decreased both the total cholesterol and TG, but not to control levels. CMG primarily decreased TG and was not as potent as atorvastatin. P-407 increased atherogenic LDL-C (IDL-C and LDL(1-3)-C subfractions) and very low-density lipoprotein-C (VLDL-C) (VLDL(1-2)-C and VLDL(3-5)-C subfractions) fractions, with an increase of the total anti-atherogenic HDL-C fraction (HDL(2)-C subfraction). Atorvastatin treatment of lipemia was followed by a decrease in the total LP-C, total LDL-C (LDL(1-3)-C subfraction), and the LDL(1-3)-TG subfraction. Additionally, atorvastatin treatment resulted in an increase in the serum matrix metalloproteases activity both in control and P-407-treated mice.

    "142": "Diabetes is a disorder of energy metabolism associated with increased cancer risk, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In a prospective cohort of patients enrolled in the Hong Kong Diabetes Registry, we explored risk factors for cancer including drug usage in type 2 diabetes. In a series of published papers, we reported a linear risk association of cancer with glycated haemoglobin with a threshold at 6.0%-6.5% and non-linear risk associations of body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride and white blood cell (WBC) count in V-shaped or A-shaped manners. Detailed pharmacoepidemiological analysis revealed markedly attenuated cancer risk in patients treated with insulin and oral anti-diabetic drugs compared with non-users of these drugs. We further observed significant drug-subphenotype interactions with attenuated cancer risk in metformin users with low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor users with high WBC count and statin users with co-presence of low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plus albuminuria or low triglyceride. These novel observations corroborate with experimental findings of possible consequences of hyperglycaemia on dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism, renin-angiotensin system and adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathways, all of which may be implicated in carcinogenesis. On the basis of these epidemiological and experimental findings, we argue for the strong need to strengthen the health care system to ensure that type 2 diabetes subjects receive appropriate drugs to optimize internal milieu to reduce all events including cancer. Apart from mechanistic studies, large-scale, randomized clinical trials using medications such as statin, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and metformin in patients with risk-conferring subphenotypes are needed to confirm their anti-cancer effects.",

Despite the availability of highly effective lipid-modifying agents, many patients still do not reach lipid targets established by national guidelines. This, in turn, has prompted a resurgence of the search for drugs and algorithms that favourably affect the lipid profile. The preventive efforts made so far have demonstrated that lowering low density lipoprotein-cholestrol is one action that individuals and populations can do with significant success in delaying the onset of clinical events, but at the same time one should not neglect high density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels as they also play a significant role in the risk of developing complications. Combination regimens should be considered for use in patients who fail to meet target values and are compliant with their current therapy. Although the use of combination therapy varies considerably across the globe, this treatment strategy is becoming increasingly more common as treatment guidelines recommend more aggressive therapy in order to achieve lower target cholesterol goals.",

Clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic RAS are both direct (hypertension and kidney dysfunction) and indirect (increased cardiovascular events and mortality). However, in many cases, atherosclerotic RAS seems to be an incidental finding with no discernable effects. Antihypertensive medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, along with statins and aspirin, have significantly improved the medical treatment of atherosclerotic RAS. However, revascularization is still advocated in a variety of clinical settings such as the preservation of renal function, recurrent episodes of \"flash\" pulmonary edema, and in patients with refractory hypertension. Current management guidelines indicate \"resistant hypertension\" as an indication for renal artery revascularization. A large number of observational studies support revascularization for both control of high blood pressure and/or preservation of renal function. Unfortunately, the favorable effects of revascularization on these end points seen in the observational studies were not reproduced in randomized controlled trials compared to medical therapy alone. The ability for revascularization to improve control of congestive heart failure or to prevent hard cardiovascular end points (eg, myocardial infarction or stroke) has not been tested in the randomized clinical trials published to date. Hence, the efficacy of intervention remains controversial, which poses a dilemma, especially given the large number of elderly patients with resistant systolic hypertension.",

Treatment of dyslipidemia in these patients is generally based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III goals for individuals without HIV. For individuals with \u2265 2 cardiovascular risk factors, the risk of CHD should be evaluated using the Framingham risk calculator and managed accordingly. Switching to an antiretroviral regimen with a favorable lipid profile should be considered before pharmacologic management if virologic suppression can be maintained. Statins are the first-choice therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but in HIV-infected individuals, special consideration must be given to drug-drug interactions, specifically those between protease inhibitors and statins. Management of dyslipidemia in HIV-infected individuals is a challenging but important aspect of chronic disease management. Additional research, specifically related to the role of chronic inflammation, is needed to better define the relationship between HIV infection and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "151": "Patients with dyslipidemia receive a cardiovascular benefit from lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Atorvastatin is currently one of the most effective approved medications for lowering LDL-C, and has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular risk in many patient groups. However, even with substantial lowering of LDL-C with atorvastatin, patients still have a residual risk for coronary heart disease. Elevated triglyceride levels and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels may contribute to this risk. Approved medications targeting these secondary lipid parameters include fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and niacin. Among these medications, niacin provides the optimal increase in HDL-C levels and has efficacy similar to the other medications in lowering triglyceride levels. However, there are challenges to adherence with niacin treatment. The most common challenge during niacin treatment is flushing, although it typically decreases with ongoing use and can be ameliorated by pretreatment with aspirin and counseling by the prescriber. A combination of atorvastatin and niacin may provide more complete normalization of the lipid profile and increased cardiovascular benefits. A literature review of the PubMed and Embase databases was conducted for clinical studies that reported on the lipid-modifying efficacy of the atorvastatin plus niacin combination. Identified studies involved patients at risk for coronary heart disease and patients with established coronary heart disease. Overall, the studies were small but indicated that atorvastatin in combination with niacin was efficacious in normalizing lipid parameters. Larger lipid studies as well as studies evaluating cardiovascular outcomes during atorvastatin plus niacin treatment are warranted.",

The steroid was administered at 15 weeks of age. Pravastatin, as a statin, was administered in the drinking water for 4 weeks. The rats were killed when 17 weeks old.

    "156": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) has become an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. Moreover, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) allows other cephalad arteries revascularization. The aim of this study was to evaluate late outcomes of cephalad arteries PTA.", 
    "157": "This is an international multicenter registry of 434 consecutive patients in which 497 PTAs were performed. Patients with symptomatic >50% stenosis or asymptomatic >70% stenosis were enrolled. Stenting of 577 internal carotid arteries (ICA) and 13 common carotid arteries was performed, 20.7% procedures were complex in which bilateral carotid stenoses or carotid and vertebral arteries stenoses were revascularized at one stage. In 15.9% patients, one-stage coronary intervention was carried out. Distal protection devices were used in 69.6% of cases. PTAs were divided into high (n = 330) and low (n = 167) risk of major adverse coronary and cerebral events (MACCE).", 
    "158": "At 30 days, there were 15 (3.5%) cases of MACCE [0.9% deaths, 2.1% strokes, and 0.9% myocardial infarction (MI)]. TIAs were observed in 15 (3.9%) patients. There was no significant difference in stroke incidence between procedures with or without neuroprotection (1.8 vs. 3%; P = 0.66) as well as in MACCE occurrence between high and low-risk groups (4.3 vs. 2%; P = 0.34). Bilateral stenoses increased while hypertension decreased the risk of MACCE. Left ICA lesions increased the risk of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). At 4 years (1-11 years), the mortality rate was 11.5%, 6% of patients had stroke, and 3% MIs. Restenosis occurred in 3%. There was a trend toward higher mortality rate (13.3 vs. 6.9%; P = 0.07) and MACCE risk in high-risk group (23.5 vs.14.7% P = 0.06). Age > 65 y.o. and stent length < 24 mm increased, while the statin therapy on admission decreased the risk of long-term death. Structural valve disease and stent length <30 mm increased the risk of MACCE, while implantation of Acculink stent decreased the risk of CVA.",

    "160": "The mevalonate pathway is a core biochemical process, crucial for the generation of cholesterol and other key metabolic end products. The rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), is safely and effectively targeted by the statin family of inhibitors to treat hypercholesterolemia. The anticancer activity of statins has also been widely reported, yet the tumor-selective mechanisms that mediate these antiproliferative effects remain largely unclear. The importance of altered metabolism in the context of tumorigenesis has received renewed attention as metabolic changes entwined with the molecular hallmarks of cancer have been elucidated. Although several metabolic pathways have been linked to cancer progression and etiology, it was only recently that HMGCR and the mevalonate pathway were also shown to have a distinct role in cellular transformation. In this review, we chart the historical progression of statins from cholesterol-lowering blockbusters to anticancer agents with imminent potential, and further discuss an emerging role for HMGCR and the mevalonate pathway in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer.", 
    "161": "This study evaluated the effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on the stability of atherosclerotic plaque. A vulnerable plaque model was established in rabbits, using balloon injury combined with a high-cholesterol diet. The rabbits were distributed into a control group, a low-dose PGE1 treatment group, a moderate-dose PGE1 treatment group, a high-dose PGE1 treatment group, and a simvastatin treatment group, with treatments lasting for 4\u00a0weeks. At week 13 (at the end of the experiments), atherosclerotic plaque was triggered by injection of Russell's viper venom (Chinese) and histamine. Serological, pathological, immunohistochemical, and gene-expression studies were subsequently performed. PGE1 treatment did not alter serum lipid levels; however, PGE1 dose-dependently increased the thickness of the fibrous caps, and decreased the plaque vulnerability index. The plaque contents of macrophage- and the mRNA levels of monocyte-chemotactic protein-1, matrix metalloproteinase-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were markedly reduced in all of the PGE1 treatment groups, with the high-dose of PGE1 being more effective than the simvastatin treatment. These findings suggest that PGE1 dose-dependently enhances the stability of atherosclerotic plaque. The high-dose of PGE1 presented more protection in terms of inhibiting macrophage accumulation and inflammatory expression in plaque. Our findings suggest a novel drug for the treatment of atherosclerosis.", 
    "162": "Macrophages can be found in all stages of atherosclerosis and are major contributors of atherosclerotic plaque development, progression and destabilization. Continuous recruitment of monocytes drives this chronic inflammatory disease, which can be intervened by several strategies: reducing the inflammatory stimulus by lowering circulating lipids and promoting cholesterol efflux from plaque, direct and indirect targeting of adhesion molecules and chemokines involved in monocyte adhesion and transmigration and inducing macrophage death in atherosclerotic plaques in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs. This review discusses the outlined strategies to deplete macrophages from atherosclerotic plaques to promote plaque stabilization.",

    "164": "We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL up to October 2010. Randomized controlled trials comparing statin with no statin or comparing intensive vs. standard dose statin, with more than 100 participants and at least 6-month follow-up were considered for inclusion and relevant unpublished data obtained from the investigators. Twenty-nine trials of statin vs. control (113 568 participants) were included in the main analyses. In these trials, statin therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia [212 vs. 209; odds ratio (OR) = 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-1.25, P = 0.87] or of cardiac arrest (82 vs. 78; OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.76-1.45, P = 0.84), but was associated with a significant 10% reduction in sudden cardiac death (1131 vs. 1252; OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.82-0.97, P = 0.01). This compared with a 22% reduction in the risk of other 'non-sudden' (mostly atherosclerotic) cardiac deaths (1235 vs. 1553; OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.71-0.87, P < 0.001). Results were not materially altered by inclusion of eight trials (involving 41 452 participants) of intensive vs. standard dose statin regimens.",

    "166": "Statins reduce the isoprenoids farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, essential intermediates, which control a diversity of cellular events such as cytoskeleton integrity, adhesion, migration and viability. Cardiac fibroblasts are the major non-myocyte cell constituent in the normal heart, and play a key role in the maintenance of extracellular matrix. The effects of simvastatin on cardiac fibroblast processes previously mentioned remain unknown. Our aims were to investigate the effects of simvastatin on cytoskeleton structure and focal adhesion complex assembly and their relationships with cell adhesion, migration and viability in cultured cardiac fibroblasts. To this end, cells were treated with simvastatin for 24 h and changes in actin cytoskeleton, levels of vimentin and paxillin as well as their subcellular localization were analyzed by Western blot and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Cell adhesion to plastic or collagen coated dishes, migration in Transwell chambers, and cell viability were analyzed after simvastatin treatment. Our results show that simvastatin disrupts actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion complex evaluated by phalloidin stain and immunocytochemistry for paxillin and vinculin. All these effects occurred by a cholesterol synthesis-independent mechanism. Simvastatin decreased cell adhesion, migration and viability in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, simvastatin decreased angiotensin II-induced phospho-paxillin levels and cell adhesion. We concluded that simvastatin disrupts cytoskeleton integrity and focal adhesion complex assembly in cultured cardiac fibroblasts by a cholesterol-independent mechanism and consequently decreases cell migration, adhesion and viability.", 
    "167": "Recent studies have shown that atorvastatin influences bone metabolism. We investigated its bone protective effect in orchidectomised rats after 12 weeks of treatment. Eight-week-old rats were divided into 3 groups: sham-operated group, control group after orchidectomy and experimental group after orchidectomy with atorvastatin administration (12 mg/kg/day). Bone mineral density and bone marker concentrations of aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen type I (PINP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in serum, and carboxy-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in bone homogenate were measured. Total serum calcium and tibial calcium content was determined. Femurs were used for three-point bending test of the shaft and compression testing of the femoral neck. Bone markers (CTX-I, BALP, BMP-2) in control rats were higher vs. sham-operated rats. Atorvastatin reduced CTX-I, BMP-2 and OPG compared to controls. IGF-1 was decreased in control rats vs. sham-operated rats; atorvastatin increased IGF-1 vs. control rats. Atorvastatin exerts a positive effect on bone metabolism by increasing bone mineral density of the whole body, which had decreased under the effects of orchidectomy. Three-point bending test revealed an increase in maximal load values of the left femurs after atorvastatin administration compared to controls. The diameter of the left femur and length of both femurs were increased after atorvastatin administration compared to controls. Our findings suggest that atorvastatin has a beneficial effect on bone metabolism in orchidectomised rats by decreasing bone turnover, with resulting improvement in bone mineral density and bone biomechanical properties.", 
    "168": "Numerous studies with compelling evidence had shown a clear relationship between dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with diabetes mellitus. This was an observational study based on secondary data from the online registry database Adult Diabetes Control and Management (ADCM) looking into the determinants of uncontrolled dyslipidaemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Independent predictors were identified using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 303 centres (289 health clinics, 14 hospitals) contributed a total of 70,889 patients (1972 or 2.8% patients were from hospital). About thirty eight percent were reported to have dyslipidaemia. There were 40.7% patients on lipid-lowering agents and of those above age 40 years old, only 38.1% of them were on a statin. Malay ethnicity and younger age groups (<50 years old) were two major determinants of uncontrolled LDL-C, TG and HDL-C. Female gender and uncontrolled blood pressure were determinants of uncontrolled LDL-C, and poor glycaemic control was related independently to high TG. This study has highlighted the suboptimal management of diabetic dyslipidaemia in Malaysia. Pharmacological treatment of dyslipidaemia could be more effective. Healthcare stakeholders in this country, especially in the primary care, have to recognize these shortfalls and take immediate remedial measures.", 
    "169": "Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). However, the antitumoral effect of carboplatin displays unsatisfactory in NSCLCs treatment due to the AKT pathway-mediated carboplatin insensitive in NSCLCs treatment. Previous studies have shown that statins have antitumor activity, but it is unknown whether atorvastatin can reverse carboplatin resistance in lung cancer. Treatment with atorvastatin and carboplatin reduced the growth of xenograft A549 tumors in nude mice and enhanced the survival rate compared with carboplatin alone. Atorvastatin in combination with carboplatin had stronger effects on growth inhibition and apoptosis of NSCLC than either agent used individually. Carboplatin conferred anti-invasive effect in NSCLC cells mainly through inhibition of AKT activity and resultant upregulation of TIMP-1. However, the inhibitory effect on AKT activity by carboplatin was short-term. Additional atorvastatin administration resulted in synergistic inhibition of NSCLC cell invasion and stimulation of TIMP-1 expression with carboplatin through stronger and persistent inhibition of AKT activity both in vivo and in vitro. The synergy of atorvastatin and carboplatin was confirmed using another human lung carcinoma cell line (H1299). Altogether, our data demonstrate that atorvastatin may overcome carboplatin resistance in lung cancer by suppressing AKT activity and upregulating TIMP-1. A combination of atorvastatin and carboplatin may be an effective strategy in clinical therapy against NSCLCs.",

Pharmaceutical interventions, such as corticosteroids, statins and ACE-Is can attenuate the post-CPB inflammatory and immune response, by so doing, either directly or indirectly, reduce incidence of postoperative complications. Apart from its effects on lipids, statins have been found to reduce postoperative oxidative stress that may partly contribute towards improved graft patency. In addition, certain ACE-inhibitors can promote a pro-fibrinolytic environment, whose role on maintaining graft patency and clinical outcomes warrant further investigation. There is increasing evidence to support the use of combined clopidogrel with aspirin following CABG to improve graft patency, although its impact on reducing postoperative adverse events remains unclear. Factors such as drug bioavailability and individual variability in drug responses and metabolism of these antiplatelet agents can significantly influence clinical outcomes.",
