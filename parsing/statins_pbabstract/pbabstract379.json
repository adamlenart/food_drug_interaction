    "0": "The aim of this study was to monitor the antioxidant status of patients with hypercholesterolaemia during treatment with Simvastatin. Forty-seven patients, of whom 25 had confirmed familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), were treated with 10 or 20 mg of Simvastatin per day for 14 weeks. As expected, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations decreased considerably, while HDL cholesterol concentrations increased during drug treatment. In neither FH nor non-FH patients were any significant changes observed for retinol status, while plasma vitamin C concentrations were also not adversely affected by the drug therapy. In both patient groups Simvastatin therapy led to a significant decrease in plasma alpha-tocopherol (P < 0.05) concentrations, however, the alpha-tocopherol/total cholesterol ratio increased by 9.1 (P < 0.01) and 12.1% (P < 0.01) in FH and non-FH patients, respectively, during the 14-week treatment period. The coenzyme Q10/total cholesterol ratio did not change significantly in non-FH patients, but was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than the baseline ratio after 4 and 14 weeks of Simvastatin treatment in FH patients. The alpha-tocopherol/total cholesterol ratio of FH patients remained consistently and significantly lower (P < 0.01) compared with non-FH patients, indicating that LDL from the former group may be more vulnerable to free radical-mediated damage and lipid peroxidation. Our results suggest that the significant decline in circulating alpha-tocopherol and coenzyme Q10 concentrations was mainly a function of the decrease in serum total cholesterol concentrations.", 
    "1": "62 patients with hyperlipidemia II and hypertension were 8 weeks on low fat and low cholesterol diet (acc. to EAS recommendations). If LDL-Ch > or = 4.1 mmol/l the diet was continued and 12 weeks treatment by fluvastatin (Lescol, Sandoz Pharma Ltd) started with control every 4 weeks Preliminary dosage 20 mg once daily in the evening increased to 40 mg if LDL-Ch > 3.5 mmol/l. After 12 weeks the mean level of T.Chol decreased by 21%, LDL-Ch by 29%, LDL-Ch/HDL-Ch by 31% and T.Chol/HDL-Ch by 24%. HDL-Ch increased by 8% and TG decreased by 5% but not significantly. The first goal of treatment (LDL-Ch < 4.14 mmol/l) achieved 73% and second (LDL-Ch < or = 3.5 mmol/l)-43.3% patients. In 2 patients treatment was discontinued (in one due to severe alimentary symptoms and in second-due to infection of respiratory tract with increase of SGOT and SGPT) and in next 2 the dosage was decreased to 20 mg/day (due to transitory alimentary symptoms).", 
    "2": "Recent studies have documented the long-term impact of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on mortality and morbidity related to coronary heart disease, establishing the link between lowering cholesterol levels and reducing cardiac events. Our study was a comparative literature review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of four HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors-fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin-used in the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia. The data sources for our meta-analysis of the efficacy of these cholesterol-lowering agents were 52 randomized, double-masked clinical trials with at least 25 patients per treatment arm. The results showed all four agents to be effective in reducing blood cholesterol levels. We computed summary efficacy estimates for all published dose strengths for the four agents. Fluvastatin 20 mg/d reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 21.0% and total cholesterol (total-C) levels by 16.4%; fluvastatin 40 mg/d reduced these levels by 23.1% and 17.7%, respectively. Lovastatin 20 mg/d reduced LDL-C levels by 24.9% and total-C levels by 17.7%; lovastatin 80 mg/d reduced these levels by 39.8% and 29.2%, respectively. Pravastatin 10 mg/d reduced LDL-C levels by 19.3% and total-C levels by 14.0%; pravastatin 80 mg/d reduced these levels by 37.7% and 28.7%, respectively. Simvastatin 2.5 mg/d reduced LDL-C levels by 22.9% and total-C levels by 15.7%; simvastatin 40 mg/d reduced these levels by 40.7% and 29.7%, respectively. The results of our meta-analysis can be used in conjunction with treatment objectives and comparative cost-effectiveness data for these agents to decide appropriate therapeutic alternatives for individual patients.", 
    "3": "Lovastatin is a popular drug for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Few serious complications are associated with its use although rhabdomyolysis with renal failure has been reported when lovastatin is combined with cyclosporine or other drugs following transplantation. We report the case of a patient who developed hepatopathy and rhabdomyolysis accompanied by acute renal failure after 4 weeks of lovastatin monotherapy. The pathogenesis and treatment of these complications are also discussed.", 
    "4": "We have studied the effects of olomoucine, a selective inhibitor of cdk2, cdc2 and MAP kinase, on the rate of proliferation and the cell cycle progression in human cancer cells in culture. Olomoucine inhibited the growth of the KB 3-1, MDA-MB-231 and Evsa-T cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, with EC50 values of 45, 75 and 85 microM, respectively. Incubation of exponentially growing KB 3-1 cells in the presence of olomoucine led to an increased proportion of cells in G1 phase after 24 h or more of incubation. Olomoucine failed to rapidly affect the phosphorylation of the Rb tumor-supressor gene product. However, [3H]thymidine incorporation into the cell DNA was rapidly inhibited. We show that this inhibition is due, at least in part, to the diminution of thymidine entry into the cells. Surprisingly, all these cell lines, when synchronized at the G1/S interface and relaxed in the presence of olomoucine, progressed unhindered through the S phase. Under these conditions, the G2 phase transit was markedly retarded but not prevented. Insufficient permeability of the cell membrane to olomoucine may explain the low activity of the drug.", 
    "5": "The effects of simvastatin and pravastatin administered alone at initial doses of 5 and 10 mg/day, respectively, on normalization of abnormal lipid metabolism in patients with hypercholesterolemia were evaluated by a crossover method. Patients whose serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) were > or = 220 mg/dl were randomly divided into two groups, and one of the groups (group S-P: 17 patients) was treated with simvastatin first and then with pravastatin whereas the other group (group P-S: 19 patients) was treated with pravastatin first and then with simvastatin. Simvastatin or pravastatin was replaced with the other drug after 8-week administration in each group. These drugs were administered for 8 weeks each. Simvastatin and pravastatin significantly reduced the following serum lipids as compared with the levels in the observation period: TC by 23.2 +/- 8.1% and 18.1 +/- 10.9%, triglyceride (TG) by 13.0 +/- 24.7% and 5.8 +/- 47.1%, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 31.3 +/- 10.1% and 23.1 +/- 14.3%, respectively. TC and LDL-C levels were significantly (p < 0.001) lower and decreased to significantly (p < 0.001) greater degrees after simvastatin treatment than after pravastatin treatment. TC was normalized in 77.8% of the patients (28 of 36) after simvastatin treatment and in 68.9% of the patients (23 of 36) after pravastatin treatment. LDL-C was normalized in 63.9% of the patients (23 of 36) after simvastatin treatment and in 44.4% of the patients (16 of 36) after pravastatin treatment. The percentage of patients whose LDL-C was normalized by simvastatin was significantly (p < 0.05) higher as compared with pravastatin. Results of this trial, which was conducted by a crossover method, show that the initial dose of simvastatin reduces serum cholesterol and LDL-C more potently than the initial dose of pravastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "6": "Ketoconazole is an imidazole derivative that is active as a broad-spectrum antifungal agent. It is also an inhibitor of cholesterol production both in vivo and in vitro.", 
    "7": "We compared the effect of low-dose ketoconazole (200 mg/day) or simvastatin (20-40 mg/day) on lipids, lipoproteins and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in 10 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "8": "Ketoconazole reduced serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by 7.6 and 9.7%, respectively. Simvastatin was more effective, the respective changes being -34.4 and -40.6%. Serum triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were unchanged by ketoconazole therapy, whereas simvastatin decreased triglyceride levels by 33.8% and increased HDL-cholesterol levels by 8.7%. Median Lp(a) levels tended to increase during simvastatin and to decrease during ketoconazole therapy. However, due to the wide range of baseline concentrations of Lp(a), these changes were not significant.", 
    "9": "Ketoconazole has some hypocholesterolaemic potential, but the effect of simvastatin is much more pronounced. The increase in Lp(a) during simvastatin therapy has been reported earlier, whereas ketoconazole does not exhibit an effect on the level of Lp(a).", 
    "10": "Because the absorption of orally administered drugs depends on intestinal permeability, we have investigated how absorptive capacity varies from the proximal to distal intestine in rats. The effective permeabilities of compounds with a range of physicochemical properties and different absorption mechanisms were estimated by use of a previously validated in-situ, single-pass perfusion model. The low colonic permeabilities of D-glucose and L-dopa indicate the absence or low capacity of the glucose- and amino-acid-transporters in this region. With the exception of the small and moderately lipophilic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, naproxen, for which permeability was maintained throughout the intestine, the passive intestinal permeabilities for hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs were approximately twice as high in the jejunum and ileum as in the colon. These observations are in accord with those made in recent studies. However, the reasons for the high colonic permeability of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and results obtained in previous animal experiments demonstrating that the colon is the region of the intestine with the highest absorptive capacity were not fully clarified. These data show that the permeability to hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs decreases along the intestine, whereas it is maintained throughout the intestine for the small and moderately lipophilic naproxen. Further investigations are required to clarify the interplay between membrane composition, fluidity and permeability under various conditions in different absorption models.", 
    "11": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins are effective in both the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, the extent of benefit being proportional to the reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol achieved. Atorvastatin, a newly licensed compound, reportedly lowers LDL with greater efficacy than other statins. The mechanism of this action was, therefore, explored in twenty patients with refractory familial hypercholesterolemia who received in a single-blind sequence simvastatin 40 mg/day, placebo and atorvastatin 10 mg/day each for 4 weeks. At the end of the placebo period the effects of single 40-mg doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin on plasma levels and urinary excretion of mevalonic acid, indices of HMG-CoA reductase activity, were compared. Administration of atorvastatin 10 mg daily for 1 month lowered LDL cholesterol by 32.5%, compared with placebo (P = 0.0001), which was 4.5% less than the decrease after simvastatin 40 mg daily (P = 0.33). The area under the plasma curve and urinary mevalonic acid/ creatinine ratio were both significantly less during the 24 h after a single dose of atorvastatin 40 mg than after a single dose of simvastatin 40 mg (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that the greater efficacy of atorvastatin compared with simvastatin is due to more prolonged inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, presumably reflecting longer residence of atorvastatin or its active metabolites in the liver.", 
    "12": "In the monocytic THP-1 cells, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin (5 microM) enhances the conversion of exogenous linoleic (18:2 n-6) and eicosapentaenoic (20:5 n-3) acids to their long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) derivatives, and this effect is associated with changes in the desaturation steps. In addition, formation of monounsaturated fatty acids from endogenously synthesized precursors is increased. These metabolic changes lead to elevated LC-PUFA and fatty acid (FA) unsaturation in cells. The effects of simvastatin on FA metabolism are associated with increased synthesis of triglycerides from glycerol. The dose-effect relationships for the activity of simvastatin on total linoleic acid (LA) conversion and cholesterol synthesis reveal that enhancement of PUFA metabolism is already maximal at 0.5 microM simvastatin, whereas cholesterol synthesis is further inhibited by concentrations of simvastatin up to 5 microM. The effects of 5 microM simvastatin on PUFA metabolism are partially prevented by mevalonate (1 mM) and geranylgeraniol (5 microM) but not by farnesol (10 microM). These data indicate that HMG-CoA inhibitors have profound effects on PUFA metabolism, and that the pathways for cholesterol and PUFA synthesis are mutually modulated.", 
    "13": "One or more mevalonate derivatives of non-sterol type have been proposed to be of indispensable importance for cell growth. Conceivable mevalonate-dependent mechanisms involved in growth control are farnesylation of Ras proteins, regulation of c-myc expression, and N-linked glycosylation of the IGF-1 receptor. The latter mechanism might be rate-limited by dolichyl phosphate, which acts as a donor of oligosaccharides in glycoprotein synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. In order to study the significance for cell proliferation of the three aforementioned mevalonate-dependent processings, their inhibitory response due to mevalonate deprivation was explored and compared with the effect on DNA synthesis in the malignant melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2. We found that mevalonate depletion due to treatment with 3 microM lovastatin for 24 h, which efficiently growth-arrested the cells, hardly at all affected the expression of c-myc, and although Ras prenylation was inhibited by 50%, the most pronounced effect of lovastatin was seen on N-linked glycosylation of IGF-1 receptors, which was inhibited by more than 95%. The order and magnitude of the decreased IGF-1 receptor glycosylation, which was followed by a decreased expression of IGF-1 receptors at the cell membrane, correlated well with the inhibition of DNA synthesis. We investigated whether dolichol, and in particular dolichyl phosphate, through its participation in N-linked glycosylation, act as regulators of IGF-1 receptor expression. First, we could confirm that exogenous dolichol became phosphorylated and in this form took part in the glycosylation processing. Secondly, we showed that dolichyl phosphate, in a dose-dependent manner, could increase the number of IGF-1 receptors at the cell membrane, simultaneously as DNA synthesis was stimulated. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence for an important role of dolichyl phosphate as a regulator of cell growth through limiting N-linked glycosylation of the IGF-1 receptor.", 
    "14": "We have studied the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) from their precursors in cultured cells undergoing physiological modifications, or under the influence of lipid-lowering drugs or ethanol. The formation of arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 n-6) from the percursor linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6) in the neuroblastoma cells SK-N-BE is enhanced at early stages of differentiation, and declines when differentiation is complete, in concomitance with maximal accumulation of AA in cell lipids. In the monocytic cells THP-1, the biosynthesis of LC-PUFA is also enhanced by treatment with the HMGCoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (S), an effect which is reverted by mevalonate and other intermediates of cholesterol synthesis. Maximal activation of LC-PUFA synthesis by S occurs at concentrations lower than those required for maximal inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. In the hepatoma cells HepG2, ethanol decreases the biosynthesis of LC-PUFA while potentiating the incorporation of acetate into cholesterol. LC-PUFA synthesis appears thus to be modulated in the course of cell differentiation and complex interactions between LC-PUFA and cholesterol synthesis occur, as judged from data obtained through pharmacological manipulations.", 
    "15": "In spinach (Spinacea oleracea L.) leaf extracts, three protein kinases (PKI, PKII and PKIII) were identified each of which phosphorylated spinach nitrate reductase on serine-543, and inactivated the enzyme in the presence of nitrate reductase inhibitor, 14-3-3. PKIII was also very active in phosphorylating and inactivating Arabidopsis (Landsberg erecta) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 1 (HMGR1). PKI and PKII phosphorylated HMGR1 more slowly than PKIII, compared with their relative rates of phosphorylation of nitrate reductase. HMGR1 identical with those that are seen after phosphorylation of serine-577 by the sucrose non-fermenting (SNF1)-like PK, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Co A reductase kinase A (HRK-A), from cauliflower [Dale, Arr\u00f3, Becerra, Morrice, Boronat, Hardie and Ferrer (1995) Eur. J. Biochem. 233, 506-513]. PKI was Ca2+-dependent when prepared in the absence of protein phosphatase (PP) inhibitors, and largely Ca2+-dependent when prepared in the presence of PP inhibitors (NaF and EGTA). The Ca2+-independent portion of PKI was inactivated by either PP2A or PP2C, while the Ca2+-dependent portion of PKI became increasingly activated during storage, which we presume was mimicking the effect of an unidentified PP. These findings indicate that PK1 is regulated by two functionally distinct phosphorylations. PKI had a molecular mass of 45 kDa on gel filtration and was active towards substrate peptides that terminated at the +2 residue from the phosphorylation site, whereas PKIII was inactive towards these peptides. PKII was Ca2+-stimulated under all conditions tested. PKIII was Ca2+-indepdented, inactivated by PP2A or PP2C, had a requirement for a hydrophobic residue in the +4 position of peptide substrates, had a molecular mass by gel filtration of approximately 140 kDa, and an antibody against the rye SNF1-related PK (RKIN1) recognized a 58 kDa subunit in fractions containing PKIII. These properties of PKIII are identical with those reported previously for the SNF1-like enzyme, HRK-A. Our results indicate a considerable complexity of kinase cascades mediating the regulation of assimilatory and biosynthetic pathways in response to environmental stimuli in plants.", 
    "16": "High plasma cholesterol concentration and increased platelet activity are two major risk factors for atherosclerosis. Lovastatin, the lipophilic drug was shown to inhibit platelet aggregation whereas pravastatin, the hydrophilic drug had no such effect. Analysis of the effect of fluvastatin which is both a lipophilic and hydrophilic drug, on platelet aggregation was the goal of the present study.", 
    "17": "Fluvastatin 40 mg daily was administered to 25 patients with hypercholesterolaemia for up to 24 weeks. Normal subjects acted as controls. The influence of fluvastatin on plasma lipids and on platelet aggregation and fluidity was studied. The direct effect of fluvastatin on platelets was compared with that of other statins.", 
    "18": "Fluvastatin therapy (40 mg day (-1) for a period of 4 weeks) in hypercholesterolaemic patients resulted in a 23% and 29% reduction in plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol respectively. Platelet cholesterol/phospholipids molar ratio was reduced by 26% and platelet aggregation was significantly (P<0.02) reduced by 10% after 4 weeks of fluvastatin treatment. On continuing fluvastatin therapy for additional 20 weeks, no further decrement in plasma LDL cholesterol levels or in platelet cholesterol/phospholipid ratio were noted. However, platelet aggregation was further significantly (P<0.01) reduced by up to 15%. Incubation of platelets with increasing concentrations of fluvastatin or lovastatin, demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in platelet aggregation, whereas pravastatin showed no effect. This inhibitory effect of fluvastatin or lovastatin on platelet aggregation (up to 34% or 22% respectively at a concentration of 1 microg statin ml (-1) was found both in platelet rich plasma and in washed platelet suspensions. Fluvastatin and lovastatin (but not pravastatin), seem to share similar platelet binding sites, as non labelled fluvastatin or lovastatin were able to displace [3H]-labeled-fluvastatin from its binding sites on platelets.", 
    "19": "Fluvastatin therapy reduces platelet aggregation via a dual effect which involves its in vivo hypocholesterolaemic action on platelet cholesterol content, and also a direct effect of the drug binding to the platelets. The antiatherogenicity of fluvastatin may be related, in addition to its plasma cholesterol lowering ability, to its inhibitory effect on platelet activation.", 
    "20": "The ocular lens must continuously synthesize the cholesterol required to support membrane formation for its life-long growth. The roles of transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms in controlling 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) protein levels in cultured lens epithelial cells were examined by measuring the effect of restricting exogenous cholesterol, endogenous cholesterol synthesis and mevalonate derived nonsterols upon HMGR protein and mRNA levels and upon the synthesis and degradation of HMGR protein. Sterols were restricted by culturing in lipoprotein deficient media and blocking 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase with U18666A. Mevalonate derived nonsterols were additionally restricted by inhibition of HMGR activity with lovastatin. A 4-fold increase in HMGR protein levels due to restricting sterols with U18666A could be explained by comparably increased mRNA levels and enzyme protein synthesis. The very rapid turnover of HMGR protein (T(1/2) approximately 45 min) was unaffected. The additional restriction of mevalonate derived nonsterols increased HMGR protein levels to about 400-fold. A 10-fold slowing in the rate of enzyme degradation coupled with at least a 5-fold increase in mRNA levels likely accounted for this accumulated protein mass. The capacity of the nonsterol regulators to promote enzyme degradation appeared independent of sterols, since mevalonate restored rapid degradation of HMGR protein when 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase activity was simultaneously blocked. Thus, in cultured lens epithelial cells, sterols appear to exert a modest influence on HMGR protein levels solely by suppressing transcription; whereas, mevalonate derived nonsterols exert major influence mainly by accelerating enzyme protein degradation. We speculate that nonsterol isoprenes might be important for preventing overexpression of cholesterol biosynthesis in the intact lens.", 
    "21": "We have previously demonstrated that monatepil maleate, AJ-2615, a new calcium antagonist endowed with alpha1-adrenoceptor blocking property, has antiatherosclerotic and plasma lipid-lowering effects in Japanese monkeys fed on a cholesterol-rich diet. To clarify the mechanisms on plasma lipid-lowering action, we investigated the effect of monatepil maleate in these monkeys on hepatic acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity. Both ACAT activity and esterified cholesterol content in the livers of monkeys fed on a cholesterol-rich diet for 6 months significantly increased about 7- and 16-fold, respectively, as compared with those in monkeys fed on a standard diet. Monatepil maleate (30 mg/kg/day for 6 months, orally) inhibited the increases of ACAT activity and esterified cholesterol content by 51% and 71%, respectively. In in vitro experiments, monatepil maleate inhibited ACAT activity in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas it did not affect 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. A kinetic analysis revealed that monatepil maleate was a noncompetitive type inhibitor of ACAT. Hepatic ACAT activity was significantly correlated to hepatic esterified cholesterol content (r = 0.775, P < .0001), to plasma very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) content (r = 0.765, P < .0001) and to plasma total cholesterol content (r = 0.573, P < .005) in the monkeys. These results suggest that ACAT-inhibiting effect of monatepil maleate plays an important role in the reduction of hyperlipidemia.", 
    "22": "The Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft trial is an important milestone that documents the benefits of treating hypercholesterolemia in patients with severe coronary atherosclerosis who have had bypass surgery. In the present article, we highlight the rationale, study design, and results of the Post-CABG study, which was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine.", 
    "23": "Fibrates and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors are commonly used in the treatment of diabetic dyslipidaemia. However, these two groups of drugs have not been compared in diabetic patients in a randomized controlled trial. Therefore, a multicentre study was performed in 73 subjects with non-insulin-dependent (Type 2) diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and combined hyperlipidaemia (serum cholesterol 6.2-10.0 mmol l(-1), serum triglycerides 2.3-10.0 mmol l(-1)), comparing the efficacy of 400 mg bezafibrate with 10 mg simvastatin in a double-blind fashion. Treatment with bezafibrate during 12 weeks reduced serum triglycerides significantly more than simvastatin (-41% vs -22%, p < 0.001) and increased HDL cholesterol more (bezafibrate: + 17% vs simvastatin: + 9%, p < 0.05). LDL cholesterol levels decreased by 14% (p < 0.001) during simvastatin and increased by 21% (p < 0.01) during bezafibrate. This increase in LDL cholesterol was positively correlated with fasting serum triglycerides (p < 0.001) and was associated with a reduction of the serum apolipoprotein B concentration, suggesting an increase in LDL particle size. Metabolic control of diabetes (fasting glycaemia; HbA1c) and insulin secretion (C-peptide levels) were unaffected by both treatments. The incidence of side-effects during treatment was similar for both drugs. Thus, 400 mg bezafibrate mainly increases HDL cholesterol and lowers serum triglycerides but at the expense of an increase in LDL cholesterol; 10 mg simvastatin lowers LDL cholesterin more effectively but has a smaller effect on HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.", 
    "24": "In previous studies, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (HMGRI) was associated with myotoxicity in cultures of neonatal rat skeletal myotubes, and rhabdomyolysis in rats, rabbits, and humans in vivo. In vitro myotoxicity was directly related to HMGRI-induced depletion of mevalonate, farnesol, and geranylgeraniol, since supplementation with these intermediate metabolites abrogated the toxicity. Both farnesol and geranylgeraniol are required for the posttranslational modification, or isoprenylation, of essential regulatory proteins in mammalian cells. The objective of the present study was to measure changes in protein isoprenylation in cultured neonatal rat skeletal muscle cells exposed for 24 hr to increasing concentrations of pravastatin or lovastatin. Proteins were labeled with [3H]mevalonate, [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), or [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and then separated by SDS-PAGE and quantitated by scintillation counting and densitometry of autoradiographs. Mevalonate and FPP labeling of the majority of proteins increased in a concentration-dependent manner, even at concentrations greater than 2 microM lovastatin and 25 microM pravastatin that completely inhibited cholesterol synthesis. In contrast, mevalonate and FPP labeling of three protein bands with molecular weights of 26.6, 27.7, and 28.9 kDa was markedly inhibited at concentrations higher than 1 microM lovastatin and 400 microM pravastatin, which inhibited protein synthesis and disrupted myotube morphology after longer exposures in a previous study. In contrast, these proteins were equally well labeled by GGPP at all HMGRI concentrations tested, suggesting that isoprenylation of the 26.9-, 27.8-, and 28.9-kDa proteins requires geranylgeraniol. The results of this study indicate that HMGRI-induced myotoxicity is most likely related to reduced posttranslational modification of specific regulatory proteins by geranylgeraniol.", 
    "25": "The cholesterol-lowering HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (HMGRI), pravastatin and lovastatin, have been associated with skeletal myopathy in humans and in rats. In a previous in vitro study, HMGRI-induced changes in neonatal rat skeletal muscle cells were characterized by reversible inhibition of protein synthesis and loss of differentiated myotubes at concentrations markedly lower than those inducing enzyme leakage. Myotoxicity was determined to be directly related to inhibition of HMG CoA reductase, since mevalonate, the immediate product of HMG CoA reductase metabolism, abrogated the drug-induced changes. Farnesol, geranylgeraniol, and squalene are metabolites of mevalonate. Squalene, formed from farnesol by squalene synthase, is the first metabolite solely committed to cholesterol synthesis. In contrast, geranylgeraniol, formed by the addition of an isoprene group to farnesol, is the first metabolite uncommitted to cholesterol synthesis. The objective of the present study was to determine the role of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in HMGRI-induced in vitro myotoxicity. HMGRI-treated neonatal rat skeletal muscle cultures were supplemented with farnesol and geranylgeraniol, and in another study, muscle cultures were exposed to two squalene synthase inhibitors (SSI), BMS-187745 and its prodrug ester, BMS-188494. Endpoints evaluated for both studies included protein synthesis ([3H]leucine incorporation), total cellular protein (a measure of cell loss), intra- and extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity (a measure of membrane integrity), cholesterol biosynthesis ([14C]acetate incorporation), and morphology. HMG CoA reductase inhibitor-induced morphologic changes and inhibition of protein synthesis were significantly ameliorated by supplementation with farnesol and geranylgeraniol. In contrast to HMGRI-induced in vitro myotoxicity, SSI induced an irreversible, minimal cytotoxicity at close to maximum soluble concentrations. These results indicate that depletion of metabolites of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and not inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, is the primary cause of HMG CoA reductase-induced myotoxicity.",

Following intravenous hydration and administration of bicarbonate, the patients' condition resolved without permanent' sequelae.", 
    "28": "Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome resulting from the destruction of skeletal muscle that may progress to renal failure Several drugs have been associated with rhabdomyolysis, including lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that may increase the risk of lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. To our knowledge, these cases are the first published reports of lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis associated with azithromycin and clarithromycin.", 
    "29": "The risk of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis due to the potential interaction between lovastatin and azithromycin or clarithromycin should be considered before the concomitant use of these agents.", 
    "30": "The possibility that potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase may alter the mechanisms by which dietary cholesterol and farnesol regulate this gene was investigated by comparing the regulatory responses of rats maintained on diets with or without 0.04% Lovastatin supplementation to dietary cholesterol. It was found that the rate of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase transcription was significantly decreased by dietary cholesterol in animals fed Lovastatin-supplemented diets, whereas animals maintained on a normal chow diet showed no decrease in the rate of transcription. The levels of reductase mRNA were decreased to about 10% of controls in Lovastatin-supplemented animals in response to dietary cholesterol but not affected in nonsupplemented animals. Administration of farnesol, reputed to be the nonsterol regulator of reductase, to rats maintained on a diet containing Lovastatin decreased hepatic HMG-CoA reductase protein by 30% and the half-life of reductase immunoreactive protein to 4.0 h, which is close to that observed in chow-fed animals. In contrast, farnesol treatment does not affect the turnover rate of reductase protein in rats fed a normal chow diet. These results suggest that potent inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase may unmask transcriptional regulation by dietary cholesterol and accelerated degradation of the reductase by the putative nonsterol regulator farnesol.",

We also studied platelet-dependent thrombin generation in patients with hypercholesterolemia before and after treatment with pravastatin. Calcium chloride was added to 0.5 ml of platelet-rich plasma (150 x 10(9)/liter) to initiate coagulation. Ten microliters of the sample was transferred into 90 microliters of 3.8% sodium citrate at 10-min intervals for 30 min. A chromogenic substrate, S-2238, was added to each sample, and absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 405 nm to determine thrombin generation.",

    "37": "We directly compared the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin in hypercholesterolemic patients. This 1-year, randomized, double-blind study was performed at 9 community- and university-based research hospitals in Australia. One-hundred seventy-seven patients between the ages of 18 and 80 years with baseline low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or = 4.14 and < or = 7.76 mmol/L (160 and 300 mg/dl, respectively) and triglycerides < or = 4.52 mmol/L (400 mg/dl) received once-daily dosing with atorvastatin (Lipitor) 10 mg or simvastatin (Zocor) 10 mg. At week 16, the dose of medication was titrated to atorvastatin 20 mg or simvastatin 20 mg if patients did not meet LDL cholesterol target of < or = 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dl). Efficacy was reported as percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins AI and B, and lipoprotein(a). Atorvastatin caused significantly greater reductions from baseline than did simvastatin for LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B (p <0.05). No patient in either treatment group had clinically important elevations in creatine phosphokinase, alanine aminotransaminase, or aspartate aminotransaminase. No serious adverse events were considered associated with treatment. With atorvastatin 10 mg, 46% of the patients achieved LDL cholesterol target goal by week 16, whereas only 27% of the simvastatin patients achieved the target goal at the 10-mg dose. This cholesterol-lowering profile affords utility in many patient types.", 
    "38": "Hippocampal long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission is the primary experimental model of learning and memory in the vertebrate brain. However, the detailed intracellular mechanisms giving rise to this persistent increase in synaptic efficacy remain incompletely understood. Mevalonic acid constitutes the basic precursor not only for cholesterol, dolichol and ubichinone but also for farnesyl-pyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, which are required for post-translational modification of proteins. We have used the specific 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, compactin, to examine the role of isoprenoid metabolism for long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices. Compactin was applied at a concentration of 25 microM for 70 min before and during tetanization and the orthodromic population spike amplitude and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells. Compactin had no effect on the initial tetanization. However, compactin-treated slices were not able to maintain long-term potentiation for more than 60 min and population spike as well as field excitatory postsynaptic potentiation returned to basal levels after 120 min. When the slices were retetanized after 180 min, an almost full potentiation of the population spike and an only partial potentiation of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were observed. These results suggest an essential role of isoprenoid intermediates for maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation.",

During the 6-week treatment period lovastatin (60 mg/day) decreased fasting serum LDL cholesterol by 45%, LDL phosphorus by 38% and apoB by 33%. Ubiquinol content diminished by 13% as measured per LDL phosphorus. When LDL was oxidized ex vivo with AMVN both LDL ubiquinol and alpha-tocopherol were exhausted faster after lovastatin treatment compared to placebo, by 24% (P < 0.005) and 36% (P < 0.0001), respectively. Lag time in copper-induced oxidation of LDL decreased by 7% (P < 0.01). This suggests diminished antioxidant-dependent resistance of LDL to the early phase of oxidative stress.",

The prevalence of coronary heart disease among the 969 people 35-70 years old was 12.0%, in the different age groups varied between 0.8 and 20.9%. This high prevalence could be explained by the high occurence of the different risk factors. The results of cholesterol levels were analysed according to that of Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study. From 35-70 years old screened people with coronary heart disease 77 had a cholesterol level between 5.5 and 8.0 mmol/l. In these patients with 20-40 mg daily dose of simvastatin during 5.4 years long treatment from 7 predicted coronary death 3, from 17 expected non fatal myocardial infarction 5, from 13 anticipated revascularisation procedures 5 would be preventable. The 5.4 years long treatment with 20 mg simvastatin calculated with the prices of July 1996 in Hungary would cost 292831 forints, from which 87847 has to be paid by the patient. If the decrease of hospitalization costs of the coronary heart disease patients treated with simvastatin is also taken into account, the drug treatment costs, according to the literature, could be reduced with additional 88%.",

They appear to reduce stroke, most notably in patients with prevalent coronary artery disease, which may be partly due to the effects of lowering the levels of cholesterol on the progression and plaque stability of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis or the marked reduction of incident coronary heart disease associated with treatment.", 
    "45": "In the recently published CARE-study, 4,159 patients aged 21-75 years were included and randomised to treatment with pravastatin 40 mg once daily or placebo 3-20 months following a myocardial infarction. Inclusion criteria were a total cholesterol < 6.2 mmol/l and LDL-cholesterol 3.0-4.5 mmol/l. Mean follow-up time was five years. Average reduction of total cholesterol was 20% and of LDL-cholesterol 28% in the treatment group. The incidence of coronary death or non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by 24% (p = 0.003). The cholesterol levels in the CARE-study were similar to those in most western populations and lower than in the 4S study. This must be considered when evaluating the different results of the treatment in the two studies. It seems fair not only to offer statin treatment to patients complying with the 4S inclusion criteria, but also to patients with values as in the CARE population.", 
    "46": "By using a fluorescent derivatization and column-switching technique, a highly sensitive and selective high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method has been developed for the determination of simvastatin (I, beta-hydroxy-delta-lactone form) and its active hydrolyzed metabolite (II, beta,delta-dihydroxy acid form of I) in human plasma. A plasma sample spiked with internal standards was applied to a C8 solid-phase extraction column. Compounds I and II were separately extracted from plasma into two fractions. Compound I in one of the fractions was hydrolyzed to II. A fluorescent derivative was prepared by esterification of II with 1-bromoacetylpyrene in the presence of 18-crown-6 for both fractions. The pyrenacyl ester of II thus obtained was purified on a phenylboronic acid (PBA) solid-phase extraction column, and was measured by column-switching HPLC with fluorescence detection. The calibration curves for both I and II were linear in the concentration range of 0.1-10 ng/ml. The intra-day coefficients of variation were less than 11.0%, and the accuracies were between 91.7% and 117% within the concentration range for both analytes. The limits of quantification (LOQ) for both analytes were set to 0.1 ng/ml. This assay method has adequate sensitivity and selectivity to measure the concentrations of I and II in human plasma from clinical studies.", 
    "47": "The heterotrimeric G protein Gs couples several surface ligand receptors to cAMP production, as well as to both growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) gene expression in pituitary and GH cells. It has been shown that constitutively active alpha s stimulates transient expression of both PRL- and GH- chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) constructions, which indicates that both the PRL and GH promoter regions are under the influence of signal pathways mediated by alpha s. We have previously shown that the cholesterol lowering drug lovastatin decreases both the amount of G alpha s subunit in the membrane and the adenylyl cyclase activity in GH4C1 cells. Thus, we tried to verify whether that decrease in alpha s levels could affect PRL and GH secretion, as well as the expression of PRL- and GH-CAT constructions. Since the regulation of these two genes is dependent on the pituitary specific transcription factor Pit-1, the effect of lovastatin on the expression of Pit-1-CAT constructions was also studied. Our results show that lovastatin decreased the basal expression of these three cAMP-responsive genes in GH4C1 cells, being partially reversed by the addition of mevalonate to the culture medium. This effect of lovastatin on the promoter activities of the transfected constructions was also observed in PRL and GH secretion to the medium, suggesting that this drug produces similar changes in the endogenous promoters of both hormones. Moreover, the presence of lovastatin did not prevent the response to the cAMP activator forskolin, indicating that the main effect of this drug could be exerted through upstream adenylyl cyclase. In conclusion, our data indicate that lovastatin decreases the basal expression of Pit-1 and consequently of both GH and PRL genes through a mechanism probably mediated by the decrease of G alpha s levels in the cell membrane. Taken together, these results suggest that the activity of membrane heterotrimeric G proteins regulates the basal transcription of specific cellular genes in GH4C1 cells. Moreover the effects of lovastatin may be taken into account in the study of constitutively endocrine disorders associated with an increased secretion of either PRL or GH.", 
    "48": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and the gene coding for LPL is therefore a candidate gene in atherogenesis. We previously demonstrated that two amino acid substitutions in LPL, the Asn291-Ser and the Asp9-Asn, are associated with elevated triglycerides and lower HDL cholesterol and are present with greater frequency in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients than in normolipidemic control subjects. Conversely, a third frequent mutation in this gene, the Ser447-Stop, is reported by some investigators to underlie higher HDL cholesterol levels and would represent a beneficial genetic variant in lipoprotein metabolism. We therefore sought conclusive evidence for these allegations by investigating the effects of the LPL Ser447-Stop mutation on LPL and hepatic lipase (HL) activity, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in a large group of CAD patients (n = 820) with normal to mildly elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels.", 
    "49": "Carriers of the Ser447-Stop allele (heterozygotes and homozygotes) had significantly higher postheparin LPL activity (P = .034), normal postheparin HL activity (P = .453), higher HDL cholesterol levels (P = .013), and lower triglyceride levels (P = .044) than noncarriers. The influence of the Ser447-Stop allele on LPL activity was pronounced in patients using beta-blockers (P = .042) and not significant in those not using them (P = .881), suggesting a gene-environment interaction between the Ser447-Stop mutation and beta-blockers.", 
    "50": "We conclude that the LPL Ser447-Stop mutation has a significant positive effect on LPL activity and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and that certain subgroups of CAD patients carrying the Ser447-Stop mutation will have less adverse metabolic effects when placed on beta-blockers. The LPL Ser447-Stop mutation therefore should have a protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent CAD.",

However, a number of questions related to the treatment of lipid disorders and risk reduction for coronary heart disease remain, including the cholesterol concentration at which treatment would best be initiated, the optimal cholesterol reduction or goal to be attained, and the mechanisms by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce the risk for clinical events.", 
    "58": "We examined the effect of pravastatin sodium (pravastatin), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on fatty acid synthesis in rat liver. The repeated administration of pravastatin to rats at 250 mg/kg for 7 days led to a 2.8-fold increase in fatty acid synthesis in the liver. The diurnal change of fatty acid synthesis was not affected by the treatment. Hepatic fatty acid synthase activity was increased 3.2-fold, while acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity was not changed by the repeated administration of pravastatin. In rat hepatocytes, the incubation with 2 microg/ml pravastatin for 24 h increased fatty acid synthase activity 1.5-fold, as well as HMG-CoA reductase activity 2.8-fold. These results suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors might increase fatty acid synthesis in vivo through the induction of hepatic fatty acid synthase.", 
    "59": "We examined the effects of Lovastatin on LDL receptor (LDL-R) expression and rate of internalization in interleukin-2 (IL-2) expanded phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. Lovastatin increased the surface LDL-R expression, but not DiI-LDL uptake, by up to 30% regardless of whether cell proliferation was affected. It caused a dose-dependent reduction in the LDL-R internalization rate as determined with monensin. Lovastatin had no effect on IL-2 receptor internalization. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea or protein tyrosine kinase activity by genistein failed to affect the LDL-R internalization rate. Co-incubation of cells with Lovastatin and mevalonate or LDL completely restored the rate of LDL-R internalization. We conclude that Lovastatin increases the apparent surface LDL-R expression by retarding the rate of LDL-R internalization. The effect is mediated through the mevalonate pathway but not the anti-mitogenic property of Lovastatin.",

Among participants treated with conjugated estrogens, levels of non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) (13.0%) and calculated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (13.5%) decreased, while levels of HDL-C (22.5%) and triglycerides (4.2%) increased. Participants in the pravastatin group achieved reductions of 23.7% and 25.4% in non-HDL-C and calculated LDL-C levels, respectively. Levels of HDL-C increased slightly (3.7%) and triglycerides decreased by 12.1%. Among participants treated with a combination of conjugated estrogens plus pravastatin, the non-HDL-C (-25.2%) and calculated LDL-C (-28.7%) responses were similar to those of the pravastatin group, and the HDL-C response (21.2%) was similar to that observed in the conjugated estrogens group. Triglyceride levels remained similar to baseline (-0.9%) in the combined treatment group.",

The HDL-C response to combined treatment was similar to that observed in women taking conjugated estrogens alone, while the non-HDL-C and LDL-C responses to combined treatment were similar to those produced by pravastatin therapy alone. These findings support the position of the National Cholesterol Education Program that estrogen replacement, with a progestin where indicated, should be given consideration as a therapeutic option for the management of hypercholesterolemia in postmenopausal women.", 
    "64": "beta-Adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK-1 or GRK2) is a key regulatory protein involved in the regulation of G-protein-coupled receptors which associates with microsomal and plasma membranes. beta gamma Subunits of G-proteins have been suggested to mediate agonist-dependent membrane translocation of beta ARK, but their possible role in maintaining the complex subcellular distribution of the kinase is not known. In this study we show that lovastatin-mediated inhibition of G gamma subunits isoprenylation in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with beta ARK1 leads to a significant release of G beta subunits to the cytosol without causing changes in total particulate beta ARK or in the association of this kinase to plasma or microsomal membrane fractions. In addition, transient overexpression of mutant forms of G gamma unable to become isoprenylated resulted in a marked sequestration of G beta to the soluble compartment, but caused no rearrangement in the distribution of cotransfected beta ARK. These results indicate that anchoring of beta ARK to cellular membranes under basal conditions is independent of the availability of heterotrimeric G-protein subunits.",

Forty Latin-American patients were randomized to placebo or 40 mg per day for 8 weeks of fluvastatin. Fluvastatin patients had a clinical and statistical significant reduction on total cholesterol (27.7%) and LDL-C (39.1%) Vs a non-significant reduction on the placebo group (6.9% total cholesterol and 9.1% LDL-C). One patient had elevated aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferases (three times the local laboratory upper normal levels) associated with a chronic alcohol consumption, reverted 6 weeks after protocol completion.

Because it is clear that the majority of cellular protein methylation occurs in conjunction with protein prenylation, we examined the importance of prenylation to aldosterone-stimulated Na+ transport in the A6 cell line. Lovastatin, an inhibitor of the first committed step of the mevalonate pathway, inhibits the natriferic effect of aldosterone but does not inhibit insulin-stimulated Na+ flux. The addition of a farnesyl group does not appear to be involved in aldosterone's action. Neither alpha-hydroxyfarne-sylphosphonic acid, an inhibitor of farnesyl:protein transferase, nor N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-L-cysteine, an inhibitor of farnesylated protein methylation, inhibits the hormone-induced increase in Na+ transport. In contrast, N-acetyl-S-geranyl-geranyl-L-cysteine, an inhibitor of geranylgeranyl protein methylation, completely abolishes the aldosterone-induced increase in Na+ flux with no effect on insulin-mediated Na+ transport or cellular protein content. These data indicate that methylation of a geranylgeranylated protein is involved in aldosterone's natriferic action.",

A diverse group of studies have provided evidence that the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors decreases the hepatic assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. Apolipoprotein B kinetic studies performed in animals and human individuals indicate that inhibition of VLDL-apolipoprotein B secretion is an important mechanism whereby reductase inhibitors decrease plasma concentrations of these lipoproteins. Studies in cultured hepatocytes and in-vivo animal models have provided insights into how reduction of cholesterol synthesis decreases apolipoprotein B secretion. A decrease in hepatic acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase activity, secondary to reduced microsomal cholesterol concentrations, has been implicated.",

A blind study was performed in five groups of 53 Sprague-Dawley rats: sham, placebo (PL), SMV (2.5 mg x kg(-1) x J(-1)), PTX (50 mg x kg(-1) x J(-1)) and SPN (100 mg x kg(-1) x J(-1)). Drugs were administered by daily gavage over a 4-week period as soon as bile duct ligation was performed.

There was a significant correlation between portosystemic shunts and portal pressure (r(s)=0.47, p<0.01). The area of fibrosis was not significantly different among the four groups of bile duct ligated rats (PL: 8.7+/-3.9, SMV: 7.1+/-3.6, PTX: 7.8+/-2.7, SPN: 6.6+/-3.3%) but was higher than in sham rats (1.5+/-0.5%, p<0.001).

The patients had a total plasma cholesterol level of at least 250 mg/dL and had been, for at least 3 months, consuming a standard lipid-lowering diet (American Heart Association Step 1 Diet). Elderly hypertensive patients (n = 76) were randomized to receive treatment with either placebo (n = 38) or simvastatin (n = 38). The dosage consisted of 10 mg simvastatin daily during the 3-month trial. During that period, in the simvastatin group, plasma levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly (27% and 33%, respectively) compared with those levels in plasma in the placebo group. The plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased (7%), whereas triglyceride levels slightly decreased (8%). There were no serious side effects, and simvastatin was generally well tolerated. Fasting hyperinsulinemia also improved (-21%) after 3 months of simvastatin therapy. Results of this study confirmed that a low dose (10 mg) of simvastatin daily is a safe and effective method of reducing plasma levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic, hypertensive elderly patients receiving concurrent antihypertensive drug therapy, and that it has the additional potential benefit of reducing plasma levels of insulin.", 
    "79": "The possible influence of Maalox 70, an antacid based on magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, and the H2-antagonist cimetidine, both commonly prescribed in hypercholesterolemic patients, on the pharmacokinetics of the new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin was investigated in 2 separate studies in 8 healthy young male subjects each. Cerivastatin plasma concentration/time profiles were assessed by a specific HPLC assay; in addition, total immunoreactive drug (cerivastatin plus metabolites) was determined by RIA. Single oral doses of 200 micrograms cerivastatin were administered under fasting conditions without or with 10 ml Maalox 70 suspension. The mean AUC and Cmax ratios (combined dosing/monodosing) including 90% confidence intervals were 0.92 (0.73-1.15) and 0.89 (0.72-1.10) for the HPLC data, and 0.99 (0.85-1.14) and 1.03 (0.82-1.30) for the RIA data, respectively. Thus, no interaction of the simultaneous administration of Maalox 70 on the pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin was observed. In a similar controlled, randomized nonblind 2-way crossover design the influence of the H2- antagonist and well-known cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitor cimetidine was investigated. Eight healthy young male volunteers received single oral doses of 200 micrograms cerivastatin alone or on the fourth day of a 4-day cimetidine 400 mg b.i.d. pretreatment. The mean AUC and Cmax ratios (combined dosing/monodosing) including 90% confidence intervals were 0.98 (0.90-1.08) and 0.91 (0.78-1.07) for the RIA data, and 0.89 (0.82-0.96) and 0.93 (0.80-1.09) for the HPLC data, respectively, clearly indicating that cimetidine and cerivastatin did not interact pharmacokinetically. These results do not only reflect the apparent insensitivity of cerivastatin absorption to possible changes in gastric pH, but demonstrate that the metabolic pathways of cerivastatin, involved in its first-pass metabolism and elimination, are rather insensitive to cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition induced by cimetidine.", 
    "80": "To determine the absolute bioavailability of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin, 12 healthy young male volunteers received single doses of either 100 micrograms as a 1-minute bolus infusion or 200 micrograms orally as tablets in a controlled, randomized crossover study. In addition, 8 of the 12 subjects participated in a third treatment period in which 200 micrograms cerivastatin were administered as an oral solution as reference for determining the relative bioavailability of the tablet drug formulation. Plasma samples were analyzed for cerivastatin by a specific HPLC assay with fluorescence detection after post-column irradiation of the eluate, with a limit of quantification of 0.1 microgram/l. Following all treatments, cerivastatin was well tolerated and no clinically relevant adverse events or changes in laboratory parameters were observed. Vital signs and ECG remained unchanged. Plasma concentration/time profiles of cerivastatin following intravenous bolus could be described by a 2-compartment model with a distribution half-life of 3-5 min and an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.4 h. For the 2 oral administrations a 1-compartmental pharmacokinetic model with a first-order absorption process was best to describe the plasma concentration/time data. Based on the AUCnorm values of the 7 subjects, valid for complete pharmacokinetic evaluation, the absolute bioavailability of tablet and oral solution was 60.0 and 59.6% (90% confidence intervals 53-68%), respectively. The relative bioavailability of tablet compared with solution was 100.7% (90% confidence interval 89-114%), with tablet and oral solution showing nearly identical in vivo absorption characteristics and almost superimposable plasma concentration/time curves. The tablet formulation, therefore, can be regarded as an optimal oral formulation with respect to galenic aspects.", 
    "81": "The possible influence of the bile acid sequestering agent cholestyramine, a basic comedication in hypercholesterolemic patients, on the pharmacokinetics of the new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin was investigated. When both drugs were administered concomitantly in the morning under fasting conditions, a decrease in relative bioavailability by 21% could be observed, possibly due to irreversible adsorption of the statin to the resin. In addition, the delay in absorption led to a 41% decrease in cerivastatin mean maximum plasma concentration which also occurred at later time. A second study addressed in detail the question of time interval required between both treatments to minimize the influence of cholestyramine pretreatment on cerivastatin bioavailability: dosing of cerivastatin at dinner (6 p.m.) or bed time (10 p.m.) with cholestyramine pretreatment 1 hour before meal (5 p.m.) in both treatments. The decrease in mean AUC was now approximately 8-16% depending on the time of pretreatment (1-hour-interval: 16%, 5-hour-interval: 8%), and Cmax decreased by approximately 32%, irrespective of the time of pretreatment. Tmax was increased in both treatments, whereas t1/2 was not changed. The presented data support the conclusion that when administered concomitantly, the bioavailability of cerivastatin is moderately reduced by adsorption to cholestyramine. Following, however, the dosing instructions of both cholestyramine (1 hour before meal) and cerivastatin (once-daily in the evening at dinner or at bed time), i.e. administering both drugs several hours (at least 1 hour) apart, the observed effects on rate and extent of absorption of cerivastatin are unlikely to be of clinical relevance.", 
    "82": "The objectives of the present study were to characterize the surface expression of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) in Epstein-Barr virus transformed lymphocytes (EBV-L) and to determine the applicability of the cellular system for the study of familial hypercholesterolemia. The EBV-L subsets and LDL-R expression were determined by immuno-cytofluorimetry. The LDL-R expression in EBV-L which consisted of mostly B cells was no different among antigenic subsets. EBV-L cultured in lipoprotein deficient serum demonstrated a 9.3-fold higher LDL-R expression than primary lymphocytes. Lovastatin caused an additional 1.9-and 1.4-fold increase in EBV-L and primary lymphocytes respectively. This difference in lovastatin response is statistically significant (paired t-test, P < 0.001). 54% of the high LDL-R expression in EBV-L was related to the changes in proliferation measured as stimulation index (SI). LDL and lovastatin modulated the LDL-R expression without affecting SI. FH subjects demonstrated 2% (homozygote, n = 1) and 44.6 +/- 12.3% (heterozygotes, n = 35) in LDL-R expression of controls (n = 30). This maintenance of the FH phenotype and the intrinsically high LDL-R expression in EBV-L make the cellular system suitable for the study of FH as well as the regulation of LDL-R.", 
    "83": "The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is involved in cell proliferation. We investigated drugs acting at different enzymatic steps on rat aorta smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. Competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (0.1-10 microM) dose-dependently decreased (up to 90%) SMC proliferation. This effect was prevented by 100 microM MVA, 10 microM all-trans farnesol (F-OH) and 5 microM all-trans geranylgeraniol (GG-OH), precursors of protein prenyl groups, but not by 2-cis GG-OH, precursor of dolichols, squalene and ubiquinone. The same inhibitory effect was obtained with 6-fluoromevalonate (1-50 microM), an inhibitor of MVA-pyrophosphate decarboxylase. Partial recovery of cell proliferation was possible by all-trans F-OH and all-trans GG-OH, but not MVA. Squalestatin 1 (1-25 microM), a potent squalene synthase inhibitor, blocked cholesterol synthesis and slightly inhibited (21% decrease) SMC proliferation only at the highest tested concentration. NB-598 (1-10 microM), a potent squalene epoxidase inhibitor, blocked cholesterol synthesis without affecting SMC proliferation. Finally, the benzodiazepine peptidomimetic BZA-5B (10-100 microM), a specific inhibitor of protein farnesyltransferase, time- and dose-dependently decreased SMC proliferation (up to 62%) after 9 days. This effect of BZA-5B was prevented by MVA and all-trans GG-OH, but not by all-trans F-OH. SMC proliferation was not affected by the closely related compound BZA-7B, which does not inhibit protein farnesyltransferase. Altogether, these findings focus the role of the MVA pathway in cell proliferation and call attention to the involvement of specific isoprenoid metabolites, probably through farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins, in the control of this cellular event.",

Participants remained on a cholesterol-lowering diet throughout the study. One thousand forty-nine patients were randomized to receive atorvastatin 10 mg, lovastatin 20 mg, or placebo. At 16 weeks the placebo group was randomized to either atorvastatin or lovastatin treatment. At 22 weeks, patients who had not met low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol target levels doubled the dose of reductase inhibitor. Efficacy evaluation was mean percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Safety profiles as determined by change from baseline in laboratory evaluations, ophthalmologic parameters, and reporting of adverse events were similar for the 2 reductase inhibitors. After 52 weeks, the atorvastatin group maintained a significantly greater reduction in LDL cholesterol (-37% vs -29%), triglyceride (-16% vs -8%), total cholesterol (-27% vs -21%), and apoB (-30% vs -22%) (p <0.05). More patients receiving atorvastatin achieved LDL cholesterol target levels than did lovastatin patients (78% vs 63%, respectively), particularly those with coronary heart disease (37% vs 11%, respectively). Atorvastatin is highly effective and well tolerated in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia with no increased risk of adverse events.",

    "97": "Autonomous parvoviruses exert lytic and cytostatic effects believed to contribute to their antineoplastic activity. Studies with inducible clones have demonstrated a direct involvement of parvovirus nonstructural proteins (NS) in oncolysis. Human and rat fibroblasts have been stably transfected with MVM(p) (minute virus of mice prototype strain) NS genes cloned under the control of a hormone-inducible promoter. Dexamethasone-induced synthesis of the NS proteins in sensitive transformed cells results in cell killing within a few days. From these sensitive cell lines have been isolated some NS-resistant clones that also prove resistant to MVM(p) infection, suggesting that cell factors modulate NS cytotoxicity. We have previously reported that factors involved in cell cycle regulation may contribute to this modulation, since NS toxicity requires cell proliferation and correlates with a cell cycle perturbation leading to an arrest in phase S/G2. In addition to its role in cytotoxicity, NS1 can regulate transcription driven by parvovirus and nonparvovirus promoters. Since phosphorylation is a critical event in controlling the activity of many proteins, notably transcription factors and cell cycle-regulated proteins, we have examined the effect of NS1 on the synthesis and phosphorylation of cell proteins. Our results indicate that NS1 interferes, within 7 h of induction, with phosphorylation of a protein of about 14 kDa (p14). Cell synchronization has enabled us to show that phosphorylation of this protein occurs in early S phase and is prevented when NS1 is induced. This early effect of NS1 on p14 phosphorylation may be directly linked to cytotoxicity and is probably related to the previously reported inhibition of cell DNA synthesis. Late in the induction period (24 h), NS1 also alters the synthesis of a 50-kDa protein and a 35-kDa protein (p50 and p35, respectively). Microsequencing of p35 reveals sequence homology with beta-tubulin. These effects of NS1, observed only in NS1-sensitive cell lines, may be related to the protein's cytotoxicity.",

    "99": "Lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)] is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), especially in the presence of a raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C). To ascertain whether reduction of both LDL and Lp(a) is more advantageous than reduction of LDL alone, patients with heterozygous FH and CHD were selected randomly to receive either LDL apheresis fortnightly plus simvastatin 40 mg/day or colestipol 20 g plus simvastatin 40 mg/day. Quantitative coronary angiography was undertaken before and after 2.1 years. Changes in serum lipids were similar in both groups except for the greater reduction of LDL-C and Lp(a) by apheresis. There were no significant differences in primary angiographic endpoints, and none of the angiographic changes correlated with Lp(a). Although LDL apheresis plus simvastatin was more effective than colestipol plus simvastatin in reducing LDL-C and Lp(a), it was not more beneficial in influencing coronary atherosclerosis. Decreasing Lp(a) seems unnecessary if LDL-C is reduced below 130 mg/dl.", 
    "100": "Pumpkin-seed oil (PSO), a natural supplement rich with antioxidants and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), was given in combination with simvastatin, as antihypercholesterolemic drug, to high cholesterol-fed rabbits, for three weeks. In comparison with normal rabbits, a significant increase of the aortic contractile response to norepinephrine was observed which could be attributed to endothelium dysfunction. In addition, serum levels of total lipids, triacylglycerols, total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were increased while phospholipids and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were decreased in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. These changes could be related to the predominance of LDL and oxidized-LDL particles caused by high levels of reactive oxygen species during hypercholesterolemia (HC). Treatment with simvastatin modulated most of the altered parameters affected during HC that might be, in part, due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. While concomitant administration of simvastatin and PSO succeeded to cause marked reduction of the aortic contractile response to norepinephrine and to normalize the most adverse effects observed during HC. These effects were explained by the potentiating effects of simvastatin with antioxidants and essential fatty acids in PSO. On the contrary, serum activities of aminotransferases and creatine phosphokinase were increased with simvastatin treatment but not with the combination therapy in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.", 
    "101": "An investigation was conducted on the effects of pravastatin, an inhibitor of the HMG CoA reductase, on lipoproteins concentrations and degradation of LDL (low density lipoproteins) in 14 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Therapy with pravastatin for twelve weeks, 20 mg every 12 hours, and a low fat (30% calories) and cholesterol (less than 300 mg/daily) diet decreased serum concentrations of LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B by 35.5% and 24%, respectively (p < 0.001 for both parameters). On the other hand, apolipoprotein A-1 concentrations increased by 15.1% (p < 0.05) and HDL cholesterol (high density lipoproteins) by 6.8%; concentrations of apolipoprotein A-II did not change. LDL degradation in peripheral lymphocytes increased by 41.3% (p < 0.05) and a correlation was observed (p < 0.05) between percentage of LDL degradation and percentage in the LDL cholesterol decrease. Likewise, a positive trend (p = 0.057) was observed between increases in LDL degradation and aging. These findings indicate that pravastatin favorably influences the lipoprotein profile and that this effect is mediated, at least partly, by an increase in cellular capacity of LDL degradation.", 
    "102": "In this study, blast cells from 15 patients with acute myeloid leukemia resistant to induction therapy were examined with two monoclonal antibodies that identify, respectively, the nuclear protein specifically expressed in non proliferating cells (statin) and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). We found that statin values varied widely, ranging from 0.6% to 14.7% (mean value 6.4%). When the patients were subdivided according to the mean value, those presenting with higher statin values survived for a shorter period of time than the ones characterized by lower levels (p = 0.003). We observed a wide variation in the range of PCNA values; however, if an agreement between survival duration and at least one of the proposed markers was considered, all but one case displayed concordance between survival duration and PCNA and/or statin values (in addition, 4/15 cases showed agreement for both markers). These preliminary data could indicate a possible discriminating prognostic factor between categories of patients characterized by different aspects of resistance, perhaps susceptible to different salvage therapy approaches.", 
    "103": "Pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, has been shown to decrease the number of acute rejection episodes in cardiac and renal transplant patients. This study evaluates the effects of pravastatin on survival of rats following liver transplant and attempts to elucidate the mechanisms of these effects. Both survival and natural killer cell enhancing factor (NKEF) studies utilized Dark Agouti rats for donor livers transplanted into Brown Norway rats as recipients. All rats received daily low-dose cyclosporine (CsA) 2 mg/kg/day by gavage. The treated groups also received gavage doses of pravastatin, 20 mg/kg/day. Survival data were analyzed by the method of Kaplan-Meier and log-rank chi 2 tests for statistical significance. For NKEF evaluation, rats were sacrificed at varying time points; total RNA was extracted from the liver and hybridized with 32P-radiolabeled NKEF DNA probes in the Northern blot technique. Radiographs were quantitated using densitometry. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Actuarial survival was improved (P < < 0.05) in rats treated with pravastatin in addition to low-dose CsA (n = 41, CsA alone n = 74). Less fibrosis and chronic rejection was seen on histological section in the treated animal livers, P < 0.05, NKEF was seen maximally at Days 5-15 tapering off at Day 21. NKEF-a and NKEF-b levels were significantly decreased in the animals treated with CsA and pravastatin compared to CsA alone in the group of animals < 16 days postop (P < < 0.05). Pravastatin improves survival in rats following OLT and while the mechanism is still unknown, inhibition of natural killer cell enhancement factor may represent an alteration in the overall immune response.", 
    "104": "From January 1994 through May 1995, Prudential HealthCare-North Texas prospectively studied 299 member patients diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia for whom pharmacotherapy with one of four 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, was prescribed. The purpose of this study was to measure the relative cost-effectiveness (CE) of these drugs in a real-world setting. This study provides information to assist decision makers in managed-care organizations (MCO) in making formulary selections. The study used a prospective, randomized, balanced cohort design, examining patients who had been prescribed initial therapy with a statin drug as monotherapy. Costs (direct medical and indirect costs) and effectiveness (percent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) were based on approximately the first 6 months of initial therapy. Both the MCO and patient perspectives were considered. In the base case, mean CE ratios were significantly lower for fluvastatin compared with lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin from both the managed-care perspective and the patient perspective. Sensitivity analysis did not alter the CE conclusions, even under conditions of varying cost structures. Although differences were found in the effectiveness of lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin measured in this study versus efficacy measured for these drugs in controlled clinical trials, sensitivity analysis suggests that these differences alone do not determine the superior CE of fluvastatin. Finally, this study supports the idea that well-designed formularies should consider drug CE (based on safety, effectiveness, and cost) and that integration of the pharmacy benefit management with other medical management is essential. These results provide evidence that fluvastatin may represent a more cost-effective formulary choice among statin products used for initial monotherapy of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "105": "The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and long-term effects on serum lipid levels of low-dose simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, in Japanese patients with moderate primary hypercholesterolemia. We assigned 201 patients (68 men and 133 women; mean +/- SD age, 61.3 +/- 10.2 years) with serum total cholesterol levels > or = 220 mg/dL to receive simvastatin 5 mg each evening; the treatment period was 1 year. Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels decreased significantly in response to simvastatin therapy, and the changes were maintained throughout the treatment period. Mean total cholesterol decreased from 269.9 +/- 35.4 mg/dL to 215.2 +/- 34.5 mg/dL (20.3%), triglycerides decreased from 183.0 +/- 110.2 mg/dL to 155.5 +/- 88.5 mg/dL (15.0%), and LDL cholesterol decreased from 180.0 +/- 33.1 mg/dL to 130.1 +/- 35.1 mg/dL (27.7%). Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol tended to decline when the pretreatment values were higher; the critical values and the bidirectional changes of the serum lipid levels were 188.1, 109.5, and 91.6 mg/dL, respectively. Although the serum level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change significantly, it tended to increase more when the pretreatment values were lower; the \"critical value\" was 70 mg/dL. Nine patients experienced mild adverse events, but none discontinued simvastatin during the 12-month treatment period. We found that low-dose simvastatin therapy is effective in achieving long-term decreases in serum lipid levels and is well tolerated by patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin therapy may result in normalization of serum lipid levels.", 
    "106": "A single 300-mg i.p. injection of poloxamer 407 (P-407, also called Pluronic F-127) in rats produces a marked hypercholesterolemia for a minimum of 96 h. The purpose of this investigation was to determine mechanisms by which P-407 causes hypercholesterolemia. The enzyme targeted for investigation is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterolgenesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Injection of P-407 in fasted rats resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) elevation in plasma cholesterol (61.2 +/- 4.2 mg/dl) as soon as 1 h after injection compared with sham-injected controls (50.1 +/- 3.7 mg/dl). Plasma cholesterol (CHO) 24 h after injection of P-407 was 449 +/- 57 mg/dl, with the fastest rate of accumulation occurring from 1 to 12 h (approximately 16.6 mg/dl/h). Over the concentration range of 0-5 mM, P-407 did not appear significantly to affect the activity of HMG-CoA reductase in vitro. However, the enzymatic activity assayed in microsomal fractions isolated from the livers of P-407-injected rats reached a maximum of 262 +/- 42.6 pmol mevalonate/min/mg approximately 15 h after injection, with a subsequent decline to control activity (94.1 +/- 8.7 pmol/min/mg) at approximately 40 h after injection. At 48 h after injection of P-407, the activity of HMG-CoA reductase significantly (p < 0.05) decreased below control values with a mean activity of 9.4 +/- 1.2 pmol/min/mg. The CHO concentrations in hepatic tissue were significantly (p < 0.01) increased at 2 h (3.26 +/- 0.19 mg/g) and 4 h (3.75 +/- 0.38 mg/g) and significantly (p < .01) reduced at 15 h (1.56 +/- 0.19 mg/g) after injection of P-407 compared with tissue CHO concentrations determined in control animals (2.65 +/- 0.18 mg/g). However, the hepatic CHO content appeared to return to control values by 24 h (mean +/- SEM, 2.61 +/- 0.08 mg/g) after injection. These data suggest that the activity of HMG-CoA reductase is regulated by some indirect mechanism(s) after injection of P-407 in rats.", 
    "107": "A large number of both primary and secondary preventive trials suggest that treatment of elevated plasma lipids may reduce the frequency of coronary heart disease (CHD) events. Meta-analyses indicate that for every 10% reduction of cholesterol, CHD mortality is lowered by 13% and all-cause mortality by 10%. Experience from several angiographic trials also suggests that coronary atherosclerosis can be retarded, and in some instances limited regression induced, by low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reduction and/or high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol elevation. Coronary angiographic studies have shown that although the effects on retardation/regression of altherogenic lesions have been small, with luminal diameter changes of around 0.10 mm, the effects on clinical events were more substantial, with reductions of the order of 50%. There is also evidence that it is the mild and moderate lesions that are of particular concern with respect to the occurrence of clinical coronary events. The progression of atherosclerosis and the occurrence of coronary events are probably not exclusively dependent on a lowering of LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Analyses from the Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study (MARS), the Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerotic Study (CLAS), and the Programs on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidaemias (POSCH) indicate that triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may also be of importance for the progression of mild/moderate lesions in subjects treated with cholesterol-lowering regimens. Recently, the results of the 5-year Bezafibrate Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial (BECAIT) demonstrated that bezafibrate significantly retarded the progression of coronary atheroma and coronary events in young male survivors of myocardial infarction, as assessed by changes in minimum lumen diameter. This positive outcome is most likely due to the beneficial treatment effects on the levels of serum triglycerides (-31%), plasma fibrinogen (-12%), and HDL cholesterol (+9%). The results of the BECAIT on progression of coronary atherosclerosis are comparable with those of two recent angiographic trials with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, the Multicenter Anti-Atheroma Study (MAAS), and the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS), despite different lipid and metabolic effects. BECAIT is the first controlled angiographic study to show that a fibrate can significantly retard the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. The exact mechanisms by which this occurs remain to be elucidated. However, the results of BECAIT illustrate the importance of factors other than LDL cholesterol in the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "108": "Because atherosclerosis is a continuous process throughout life, expert panels have suggested guidelines to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, starting from childhood. The guidelines focus on population-based measures and on treating hypercholesterolaemia in individual children. Low-fat diets in children have been widely debated. There is little evidence that growth is stunted or that nutritional deficiencies arise if the energy that is lost by limiting fat intake is substituted with other nutrients. Dietary fibre, plant sterols and fish oils have been used to modify lipid levels in children; however, the efficacy of these dietary adjuncts is limited. Bile acid-binding resins are the only approved drugs to lower cholesterol levels in children and appear to be well tolerated. However, compliance with resins is low because of unpalatability, so low dosages are preferred and vitamin supplementation is prudent. Data on HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates are insufficient to recommend these drugs at present. Drug treatment should be restricted to children who are at exceptionally high risk of disease, usually those with genetic dyslipidaemias.",

    "111": "Livers from control rats (Control), rats fed pravastatin for 7 days (Pravastatin) and livers isolated 5-7 or 8-11 hours after pravastatin had been withdrawn (Rebound5-7h; Rebound8-11h) were isolated perfused during infusion of taurocholic acid (400 nmol/min/100 g rat), to study biliary secretion of bile salts, cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine molecular species.", 
    "112": "Bile salt secretion rate was similar in all four groups, secretion of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholines was similar in Control and Pravastatin. With duration of pravastatin withdrawal the secretion rates of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol progressively increased by +38% and +122% in Rebound5-7h and by +70% and +300% in Rebound8-11h (vs Control), respectively. In parallel, the secretion rates of palmitoleoyl-oleoyl- and palmitoleoyl-arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholines rose up to sixfold and twofold, respectively, while the secretion rate of palmitoyl-linoleoylphospatidylcholines remained constant. The secretion rate of cholesterol was correlated (p < 0.01) with the secretion rates of palmitoleoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholines (r = 0.83) and palmitoleoyl-arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholines (r = 0.81). Bilirubin ditaurate or taurodehydrocholate reduced (p < 0.05) biliary secretion of phosphatidylcholines (-33%; -72%) without changes in cholesterol/phosphatidylcholine secretory ratio or phosphatidylcholine species.", 
    "113": "The secretion of the major molecular species of phosphatidylcholine in bile could be coregulated with the amount of cholesterol destined for biliary secretion.", 
    "114": "Preclinical and clinical data on atorvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, indicate that it has superior activity in treating a variety of dyslipidemic disorders characterized by elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and/or triglycerides. Results for patients randomized in early efficacy and safety studies were combined in one database and analyzed. This analysis included a total of 231 atorvastatin-treated patients (131 with hypercholesterolemia (HC), 63 with combined hyperlipidemia (CH), 36 with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), and 1 with hyperchylomicronemia (Fredrickson Type V)). Patients were treated with a cholesterol-lowering diet (National Institutes of Health National Cholesterol Education Program Step 1 diet or a more rigorous diet) and either 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/day of atorvastatin or placebo. Efficacy was based on percent change from baseline in total cholesterol, total triglycerides, LDL-C, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and non-HDL-C/HDL-C. Safety was assessed in all randomized patients. Atorvastatin seemed to preferentially lower those lipid and lipoprotein component(s) most elevated within each dyslipidemic state: LDL-C in patients with HC, triglycerides and VLDL-C in patients with HTG, or all 3 in patients with CH. Atorvastatin was well-tolerated with a safety profile similar to other drugs in its class.", 
    "115": "Atherosclerosis is an increasing problem, largely due to lifestyle changes. Lipid accumulates in artery walls throughout life, and infiltration into the subintimal space of cholesterol and cholesterol esters and of inflammatory cells can lead to narrowing, clotting, thrombosis and death. Lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins [(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors] represent one important approach to treatment. They work by blocking the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate into mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. The West Of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) was a large prospective randomised study comparing the effects of pravastatin versus that of placebo in 6595 middle-aged men. In the pravastatin group the rate of fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction was reduced by one-third over 5 years, the rate of cardiovascular deaths by one-third, and overall deaths by 22% relative to the placebo group. Implications of the results are considered and the results of the US-CARE study are compared. Discussion of relative and absolute risk, and continuous and discrete risk factors leads to the formulation of rational cost/beneficial strategies for decreasing cardiovascular risk by targeting high-risk individuals with lipid-lowering drugs.", 
    "116": "Pravastatin treatment of combined hyperlipidemia lowers low-density lipoprotein effectively; nicotinic acid lowers remnant cholesterol and raises high-density lipoprotein. A combination of these 2 drugs may be indicated for optimal treatment of lipoprotein abnormalities in combined hyperlipidemia.", 
    "117": "A placebo-controlled, double-blind study on the efficacy of atorvastatin was conducted in several multicenters. Atorvastatin reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B substantially in a dose-dependent manner without any serious adverse events.", 
    "118": "Hypercholesterolaemia plays a crucial role in the development of atherosclerotic diseases in general and coronary heart disease in particular. The risk of progression of the atherosclerotic process to coronary heart disease increases progressively with increasing levels of total serum cholesterol or low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at both the individual and the population level. The statins are reversible inhibitors of the microsomal enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate. This is an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins decreases intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis, which then leads to transcriptionally upregulated production of microsomal HMG-CoA reductase and cell surface LDL receptors. Subsequently, additional cholesterol is provided to the cell by de novo synthesis and by receptor-mediated uptake of LDL-cholesterol from the blood. This resets intracellular cholesterol homeostasis in extrahepatic tissues, but has little effect on the overall cholesterol balance. There are no simple methods to investigate the concentration-dependent inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in human pharmacodynamic studies. The main clinical variable is plasma LDL-cholesterol, which takes 4 to 6 weeks to show a reduction after the start of statin treatment. Consequently, a dose-effect rather than a concentration-effect relationship is more appropriate to use in describing the pharmacodynamics. Fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin have similar pharmacodynamic properties; all can reduce LDL-cholesterol by 20 to 35%, a reduction which has been shown to achieve decreases of 30 to 35% in major cardiovascular outcomes. Simvastatin has this effect at doses of about half those of the other 3 statins. The liver is the target organ for the statins, since it is the major site of cholesterol biosynthesis, lipoprotein production and LDL catabolism. However, cholesterol biosynthesis in extrahepatic tissues is necessary for normal cell function. The adverse effects of HMG-reductase inhibitors during long term treatment may depend in part upon the degree to which they act in extrahepatic tissues. Therefore, pharmacokinetic factors such as hepatic extraction and systemic exposure to active compound(s) may be clinically important when comparing the statins. Different degrees of liver selectivity have been claimed for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. However, the literature contains confusing data concerning the degree of liver versus tissue selectivity. Human pharmacokinetic data are poor and incomplete, especially for lovastatin and simvastatin, and it is clear that any conclusion on tissue selectivity is dependent upon the choice of experimental model. However, the drugs do differ in some important aspects concerning the degree of metabolism and the number of active and inactive metabolites. The rather extensive metabolism by different cytochrome P450 isoforms also makes it difficult to characterise these drugs regarding tissue selectivity unless all metabolites are well characterised. The effective elimination half-lives of the hydroxy acid forms of the 4 statins are 0.7 to 3.0 hours. Protein binding is similar (> 90%) for fluvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin, but it is only 50% for pravastatin. The best characterised statins from a clinical pharmacokinetic standpoint are fluvastatin and pravastatin. The major difference between these 2 compounds is the higher liver extraction of fluvastatin during the absorption phase compared with pravastatin (67 versus 45%, respectively, in the same dose range). Estimates of liver extraction in humans for lovastatin and simvastatin are poorly reported, which makes a direct comparison difficult."
