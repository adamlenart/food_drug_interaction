    "0": "This study compared lovastatin and gemfibrozil therapy for effects on lipid and lipoprotein levels in 22 normolipidemic patients with reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Most patients had coronary heart disease. A randomized, crossover design consisted of two drug phases (lovastatin and gemfibrozil) alternating with placebo. Lovastatin reduced total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels by 28%, 34%, and 24%, respectively. These were unaffected by gemfibrozil. Both drugs reduced very low-density lipoprotein and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 30% to 40%. Both caused small but significant increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but not in apolipoproteins A-I or A-II. Both significantly lowered ratios of total (and low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, but lovastatin more than gemfibrozil. Thus, for normolipidemic patients with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, neither drug markedly raised high-density lipoprotein levels, but lovastatin produced the better overall change in lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels.", 
    "1": "In a Swiss multicenter study with determination of lipid and lipoprotein parameters in a central laboratory, the efficacy of simvastatin, MSD, was evaluated in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Lipid and lipoprotein values were determined in 109 patients before and after 6 weeks' therapy with 10 mg simvastatin per day. A significant decrease in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apo B, of 21.1, 25.8 and 24.1% respectively, was observed. No influence of simvastatin on apo A-II was found, but HDL-cholesterol and apo A-I were slightly increased (+6.1 and 4.4% respectively). The data show that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors constitute a new class of effective drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "2": "To evaluate the effectiveness, tolerance and safety of simvastatin (MK 733), a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, a 28-week, single blind study with placebo was carried out on 10 patients suffering from primary hypercholesterolaemia. All patients followed the AHA Phase 1 or Phase 2 diet and underwent active treatment for 24 weeks with increasing doses of simvastatin from 10 to 40 mg in a single evening administration. A reduction in plasma levels of total cholesterol (-29%, p less than 0.001 and -41%, p less than 0.001), LDL cholesterol (-35%, p less than 0.001 and -49%, p less than 0.001), VLDL cholesterol (-9%, ns and -38%, ns), Apo-B (-27%, p less than 0.005 and -37%, p less than 0.001), Apo-A2 (-3%, ns and -3%, ns), and triglycerides (+2%, ns and -10%, ns), was obtained in the VIth and XXIVth week. There was also an increase in HDL cholesterol (+4%, ns and +17%, p less than 0.05), HDL2 subfractions (+9%, p less than 0.05 and +36%, p less than 0.05), HDL3 (+3%, ns and +11%, ns) and Apo-A1 (+7%, ns and +4%, ns). In all patients, simvastatin was generally tolerated and there were no clinical, laboratory or ophthalmological side-effects related to the drug. If long-term studies confirm its safety, simvastatin will offer excellent prospects for the prevention of ischaemic cardiopathy.", 
    "3": "The reduction of total and LDL cholesterol (TC and LDLc), apoprotein B (ApoB) and in some instances triglycerides (TG) and the increase of HDL cholesterol (HDLc) and apoprotein A (ApoA) seem to be associated to a reduced coronary risk. Aim of our work was to evaluate the effects of a chronic treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (MK-733), in a group of 8 dyslipidemic patients, 5 women and 3 men, aged between 48 and 69 years (mean age 59 +/- 8 years) at high risk being already affected by clinical compliances of atherosclerosis and not previously controlled by diet and/or other antidyslipidemic drugs. At the beginning and at the end (6 months) of this open study it was performed a clinical, ECG and ophthalmological examination, as well as an evaluation of the routine laboratory parameters. The initial dosage of simvastatin was a tablet of 10 mg/day, increased after a month to 20 mg and then to 40 mg/die. The mean dosage was 26.25 mg at the 3rd month and 21.25 mg at the 6th. Long-term simvastatin treatment was well tolerated (lack of important side effects as well as of significant changes of other clinical and laboratory parameters) and effective, reducing significantly (p less than 0.01) TC (317.9 +/- 30.8 vs 238.5 +/- 37.9 mg/dl), LDLc (210.6 +/- 48 vs 147.9 +/- 52 mg/dl), ApoB (144.7 +/- 17.5 vs 104.5 +/- 18), and TG (272.9 +/- 184 vs 200.5 +/- 117.6 mg/dl) and increasing in contrast HDL and ApoA values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "4": "The patch-clamp technique and fluorescence polarization analysis were used to study the dependence of Ca2(+)-dependent K+ channel kinetics and membrane fluidity on cholesterol (CHS) levels in the plasma membranes of cultured smooth muscle rabbit aortic cells. Mevinolin (MEV), a potent inhibitor of endogenous CHS biosynthesis was used to deplete the CHS content. Elevation of CHS concentration in the membrane was achieved using a CHS-enriching medium. Treatment of smooth muscle cells with MEV led to a nearly twofold increase in the rotational diffusion coefficient of DPH (D) and to about a ninefold elevation of probability of the channels being open (Po). The addition of CHS to the cells membrane resulted in a nearly twofold decrease in D and about a twofold decrease in Po. Elementary conductance of the channels did not change under these conditions. These data suggest that variations of the CHS content in the plasma membrane of smooth muscle cells affect the kinetic properties of Ca2(+)-dependent K+ channels presumably due to changes in plasma membrane fluidity. Our results give a possible explanation for the reported variability of Ca2(+)-dependent K+ channels kinetics in different preparations.", 
    "5": "The mechanism by which competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase decrease serum cholesterol is incompletely understood. The few available data in humans suggest that chronic administration of the competitive inhibitor, lovastatin, decreases serum cholesterol with little or no change in total body sterol synthesis. To further define the effect of lovastatin on cholesterol synthesis in normal subjects, we investigated the effect of a single oral dose of lovastatin and a 4-week treatment period of lovastatin on mononuclear leukocyte (ML) sterol synthesis as a reflection of total body sterol synthesis. In parallel, we measured serum lipid profiles and HMG-CoA reductase activity in ML microsomes that had been washed free of lovastatin. ML sterol synthesis did not significantly decrease (23 +/- 5%, mean +/- SEM) at 3 h after a single 40-mg dose of lovastatin. With a single oral 80-mg dose, ML sterol synthesis decreased by 57 +/- 10% (P less than 0.05) and remained low for the subsequent 6 h. With both doses, total HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity in microsomes prepared from harvested mononuclear leukocytes was induced 4.8-fold (P less than 0.01) over baseline values. Both the 20-mg bid dose and the 40-mg bid dose of lovastatin administered for a 4-week period decreased serum cholesterol by 25-34%. Lovastatin at 20 mg bid decreased ML sterol synthesis by 23 +/- 6% (P less than 0.02) and increased ML HMG-CoA reductase 3.8 times (P less than 0.001) the baseline values. Twenty four hours after stopping lovastatin, ML sterol synthesis and HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity had returned to the baseline values. The higher dose of lovastatin (40 mg bid) decreased ML sterol synthesis by 16 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05) and induced HMG-CoA reductase to 53.7 times (P less than 0.01) the baseline value at 4 weeks. Stopping this higher dose effected a rebound in ML sterol synthesis to 140 +/- 11% of baseline (P less than 0.01), while HMG-CoA reductase remained 12.5 times baseline (P less than 0.01) over the next 3 days. No rebound in serum cholesterol was observed. From these data we conclude that in normal subjects lovastatin lowers serum cholesterol with only a modest effect on sterol synthesis. The effect of lovastatin on sterol synthesis in mononuclear leukocytes is tempered by an induction of HMG-CoA reductase enzyme quantity, balancing the enzyme inhibition by lovastatin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "6": "Simvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase was given to 7 normolipidemic healthy volunteers for 1 month at a dose of 20 mg/day. Measurements of turnover of low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B (LDL-apo B) were determined before and after drug treatment using intravenous injection of 125I-labeled LDL and 131I-labeled cyclohexanedione-treated LDL to quantify the receptor pathway. In addition to a 13% increase in HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I concentrations, plasma cholesterol was reduced by 20%, LDL-cholesterol by 32%, and apolipoprotein B by 23%. Assuming a heterogeneous pool of LDL, the new model presented in the companion paper was built to calculate the contribution of the receptor-dependent and the receptor-independent pathways and the corresponding fractional catabolic rates. Simvastatin did not modify constantly the synthetic rate of LDL-apo B but increased the fractional catabolic rate of the receptor-dependent pathway and the contribution of this pathway in the catabolism. The fall in LDL plasma levels observed in normocholesterolemic subjects can be then entirely explained by an enhanced fractional removal of LDL from the circulation by the receptor route.", 
    "7": "The involvement of oxygenated cholesterol precursors in the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was studied by examining the effect of ketoconazole on the metabolism of mevalonic acid, lanosterol and the lanosterol metabolites, lanost-8-ene-3 beta,32-diol,3 beta-hydroxylanost-8-en-32-al and 4,4-dimethylcholesta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol, in liver subcellular fractions and hepatocyte cultures. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis from mevalonate by ketoconazole at concentrations up to 30 microM was due exclusively to a suppression of cytochrome P-450LDM (LDM = lanosterol demethylase) activity, resulting in a decreased rate of lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylation. No enzyme after the 14 alpha-demethylase step was affected. When [14C]mevalonate was the cholesterol precursor, inhibition of cytochrome P450LDM was accompanied by the accumulation of several labelled oxygenated sterols, quantitatively the most important of which was the C-32 aldehyde derivative of lanosterol. There was no accumulation of the 24,25-oxide derivative of lanosterol, nor of the C-32 alcohol. Under these conditions the activity of HMG-CoA reductase declined. The C-32 aldehyde accumulated to a far greater extent when lanost-8-ene-3 beta,32-diol rather than mevalonate was used as the cholesterol precursor in the presence of ketoconazole. With both precursors, this accumulation was reversed at higher concentrations of ketoconazole in liver subcellular fractions. A similar reversal was not observed in hepatocyte cultures.", 
    "8": "Simvastatin, a derivative of lovastatin, is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis and may interfere with steroid hormone production, for which cholesterol is required. In a single-blind, placebo-controlled study, 24 patients with severe primary hypercholesterolaemia (mean serum cholesterol +/- SD = 10.74 +/- 1.59 mmol/l) were treated with simvastatin 40 mg per day for 8 weeks. Before and after treatment, the following parameters were evaluated: basal levels of ACTH, cortisol, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone; urinary excretion of free cortisol; the cortisol response after short-term infusion of ACTH; the ACTH and cortisol response during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Total serum cholesterol decreased by 35.0 +/- 8.1% (P less than 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 39.8 +/- 9.8% (P less than 0.001); high-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased by 9.2 +/- 11.1% (P less than 0.001). Basal levels of ACTH were higher after simvastatin (2.9 +/- 1.9 pmol/l vs 4.1 +/- 2.9 pmol/l; P less than 0.05) whereas basal levels of steroid hormones were not significantly changed. The excretion of free cortisol was unaltered. The peak cortisol after ACTH infusion was lower after treatment (0.87 +/- 0.23 mumol/l vs 0.78 +/- 0.10 mumol/l; P less than 0.05), but was unaltered during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. We conclude that simvastatin lowers serum cholesterol without clinically relevant effects on the adrenocortical steroid hormone secretion and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.", 
    "9": "The treatment of hypertension by costly new drugs such as the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, means that careful monitoring of health care expenditure is essential. If drugs like simvastatin come to be widely used, costs will mount even more. New drugs cannot be used indiscriminately.", 
    "10": "Proliferation of SW13 human adrenocortical carcinoma cells under anchorage independent conditions was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor mevinolin. Induction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity was observed in mevinolin treated cultures. The growth stimulatory effect of mevinolin, but not that of epithelial transforming growth factor, a polypeptide growth factor for SW13 cells, was reversed by exogenous mevalonic acid. However, neither dolichol nor low density lipoprotein supplementation affected the response of SW13 cells to mevinolin. The results suggest that mevalonic acid metabolites may participate in the regulation of anchorage independent growth of SW13 cells.", 
    "11": "The effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH-cholesterol) and chenodeoxycholic (CDC) acid on apoprotein secretion, low-density lipoprotein receptor activity, and [3H]triacylglycerol secretion in Hep G2 cells was studied. Both 25-OH-cholesterol and CDC acid increased the secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) E by Hep G2 cells. The secretion of apo A-I was slightly lowered (less than 10% disease). The maximal increase in apo E secretion was observed in culture medium containing 2 micrograms of 25-OH-cholesterol/ml or 10 micrograms of CDC acid/ml plus 10% fetal calf serum. Cholesterol, 7-OH-cholesterol and other bile acids were ineffective in inducing increases in apo E secretion. Another cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, mevinolin, was also ineffective in generating an increase in apoprotein secretion. The data indicated a specific interaction between 25-OH-cholesterol or CDC acid and apo E secretion in Hep G2 cells. Cholesterol synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of [14C]acetic acid into sterols, was repressed in Hep G2 cells in the presence of 25-OH-cholesterol (17% of control value). CDC acid, on the other hand, increased [14C]acetic acid incorporation (156% of control value). The number of LDL receptors in Hep G2 cells was decreased after incubation with 25-OH-cholesterol (62% of control value), but increased significantly after incubation with CDC acid (149% of control value). The secretion of [3H]triacylglycerol by Hep G2 cells incubated with 25-OH-cholesterol was greatly increased (248% of control value). On the contrary, CDC acid did not cause any increase in [3H]triacylglycerol secretion. The above results suggest that 25-OH-cholesterol and CDC acid have different effects on lipid metabolism in Hep G2 cells. The mRNA levels of apo E increased in cells preincubated with 25-OH-cholesterol and CDC acid, which suggested that the increase in apo E secretion is at least partly due to an increase in synthesis.", 
    "12": "A study of 27 patients (18 males and 9 females; median age 57 [35-70] years) with hypercholesterolaemia examined the lipid-reducing effect, clinical reliability and tolerance of lovastatin, an HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor, given in a single evening dose. After a four-week period on placebo and a lipid-reducing diet the patients received 20 mg lovastatin for four weeks. If, at the end of this period, total cholesterol levels were still above 200 mg/dl, the dose was increased to 40 mg, after a further four weeks to 80 mg. After a three-month treatment period total cholesterol concentration in lovastatin-treated patients was 28% lower than in the placebo group (289.4 +/- 42.2 vs 208.0 +/- 39.9 mg/dl; P less than 0.0001). LDL-cholesterol concentration had fallen by 40% (215.1 +/- 44.4 vs 130.1 +/- 24.7 mg/dl; P less than 0.0001), while plasma triglyceride concentrations had fallen by 15% (166.3 +/- 71.8 vs 141.8 +/- 69.8 mg/dl; P less than 0.01). At the same time, HDL-cholesterol levels had risen by 12% (42.9 +/- 12.4 vs 47.9 +/- 18.2 mg/dl; P less than 0.01). These results confirm the marked lipid-reducing effect of lovastatin.", 
    "13": "To further validate the usefulness of quantitative measurements of urinary mevalonic acid excretion as an indicator of rates of cholesterol biosynthesis, we have determined the 24-hour urinary excretion of mevalonic acid in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia treated with drugs that have opposing effects on cholesterol biosynthesis. In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia treated with the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine (16 gms/day), urinary mevalonate excretion increased by 28%, whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decreased by 21%. In patients with familial hypercholesterolemia treated with the 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor lovastatin (80 mg/day), concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the urinary excretion of mevalonate both decreased (by 40% and 34%, respectively). When cholestyramine was used in combination with lovastatin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by an additional 14% as compared to monotherapy with lovastatin; urinary mevalonate excretion rose by (25%), but the magnitude of this increase was not statistically significant. We conclude that rates of excretion of urinary mevalonic acid (which may reflect rates of whole body cholesterol biosynthesis) in patients with FH decrease on therapy with lovastatin and increase in response to cholestyramine treatment. When used in combination, these drugs counteract each other's effects on cholesterol synthesis, but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations decrease further. Measurement of urinary mevalonate excretion affords a practical means of assessing the comparable effects of different dietary or pharmaceutical manipulations on cholesterol biosynthesis in human beings.", 
    "14": "After 6 weeks on a lipid-lowering diet, 20 outpatients with type II hyperlipoproteinaemia (18 type IIa) were randomized to treatment with cholestyramine 12 g b.i.d. (5 patients) or simvastatin (a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) 40 mg q.p.m. (15 patients) for 12 weeks. From week 13 to week 20 nine patients in the simvastatin group and all patients in the cholestyramine group were treated with the combination of the two drugs. From week 21 to week 52 all patients were on monotherapy with simvastatin. Simvastatin treatment reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 40% after 12 weeks, compared with 33% in the cholestyramine group. This difference was not significant. The total reductions of LDL-cholesterol on combination therapy were respectively 60% and 56% in each group. After 52 weeks LDL-cholesterol was still reduced by 36% (P less than 0.001) on monotherapy with simvastatin. Simvastatin also reduced triglycerides (TG) by 17% (P less than 0.05) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was increased by 19% (P less than 0.01). No serious side effects were observed, and the new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may offer a new approach to the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "15": "CAD is a complex disease with multiple etiologies and aggravating events. Yet, elevated plasma cholesterol levels, chiefly in the form of LDL, are essential for the progression of the atherosclerotic lesion. Any total plasma cholesterol level above an ideal of 180 mg/dl (and an LDL cholesterol level of 100 mg/dl) must be considered atherogenic in the presence of other risk factors. In patients at high risk for death from CAD, combined diet and drug therapy should have as a goal the attainment of ideal lipoprotein values. Drug therapies are now available that make it possible to substantially lower elevated LDL levels in almost all patients and even to achieve ideal levels in those at highest risk.", 
    "16": "The effect of lovastatin on serum lipids and its tolerability in patients with non-familial primary hypercholesterolemia (type II-A and type II-B) during a six-month period were evaluated in this open-label study. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled in the study; tolerability was assessed in all 38 patients. Thirty patients completed the study, and the effect of lovastatin on serum lipids in these patients was assessed. Some patients had been treated for hypercholesterolemia with long-term dietary and other non-pharmacologic means before entry into the study. All patients were unresponsive to a six-week program of intensive dietary therapy and other nonpharmacologic treatment to lower their blood cholesterol levels before receiving lovastatin. While maintaining intensive dietary therapy, administration of lovastatin was instituted at a dosage of 20 mg/day, which was increased by 20-mg increments monthly, as necessary, to a maximum of 80 mg/day. In an effort to achieve goal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), ten patients received a daily dosage of 20 mg, 12 patients received 40 mg, seven patients 60 mg, and one patient 80 mg. Twenty-nine of the 30 patients achieved significant lowering of serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and apolipoprotein (apo) B-I; this was demonstrated after the first month of therapy with lovastatin and was maintained throughout the six-month treatment period. One patient failed to demonstrate lowering of these serum lipids, despite receiving the maximum recommended dosage of lovastatin of 80 mg/day. Comparative measurements of serum lipids during dietary therapy alone and after six months of diet plus lovastatin therapy were as follows: TC, 289 +/- 5 versus 216 +/- 9 mg/dl (P less than 0.0005); LDL-C, 206 +/- 4 versus 141 +/- 5 mg/dl (P less than 0.0005); and apo B-I, 112 +/- 3 versus 89 +/- 2 mg/dl (P less than 0.0005). Serum levels of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and triglycerides decreased slightly during lovastatin therapy, but the changes were not statistically significant. There were slight but statistically insignificant increases in serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apo A-I, and apo A-II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Lp(a) is a plasma lipoprotein particle consisting of a plasminogenlike protein [apo(a)] disulfide bonded to the apo B moiety of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Increased plasma levels of Lp(a), either independently or interactively with LDL levels, have been shown to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Recently, a new class of lipid-lowering drugs, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, have been introduced. These drugs act by decreasing liver cholesterol synthesis resulting in up-regulation of LDL receptors, increased clearance of LDL from plasma, and diminution of plasma LDL levels. In this study, we examined the effect of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors on Lp(a) levels in three groups of subjects, five volunteers and two groups of five and 14 patients. In all 24 subjects, mean decreases were observed in total cholesterol (43 +/- 5%), total triglyceride (35 +/- 8%), very low-density lipoprotein (45 +/- 9%), and LDL cholesterol (43 +/- 5%). The mean change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was an increase of 7 +/- 8%. Despite the very significant decrease in LDL cholesterol levels (p less than 0.001), Lp(a) levels increased by 33 +/- 12% (p less than 0.005). This was not associated with a measurable change in the chemical composition or size of the Lp(a) particle. This emphatically suggests that Lp(a) particles, despite consisting principally of LDL, are cleared from plasma differently than LDL. The surprising finding of an increase in Lp(a) levels suggests this class of drugs may have a direct effect on Lp(a) synthesis or clearance independent of its effect on LDL receptors.", 
    "18": "Simvastatin is the second in the class of compounds known as hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors to be extensively studied in humans. The drug has now been given to over 1,800 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia for periods of up to two years. In the range of dosage from 10 to 40 mg once daily, therapy is associated with reductions of up to 30 percent in total cholesterol and 40 percent in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as well as with increases of approximately 10 percent in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The most common clinical adverse experiences are mild gastrointestinal effects and headache, which seldom require discontinuation of therapy. Elevations of creatine kinase (skeletal muscle isoenzyme) levels to more than three times the upper limit of the normal range have been seen in about 3 percent of patients, but also have seldom required discontinuation of therapy. Conversely, elevations of hepatic transaminase levels to more than three times the upper limit of the laboratory normal range have been seen in about 1.5 percent of patients and have caused discontinuation of therapy in 0.6 percent of patients treated. Simvastatin appears to be an effective and well-tolerated agent for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and, as further study confirms long-term safety and efficacy, it should become a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium.", 
    "19": "A 12-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study was undertaken to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of simvastatin and gemfibrozil in 290 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Patients in stratum I (initial low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 195 mg/dl) received simvastatin 5 to 10 mg once every afternoon; patients in stratum II (initial low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at least 195 mg/dl) received 10 to 20 mg once every afternoon. Gemfibrozil was given in a constant dosage of 600 mg twice daily in both strata. Simvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 26 and 34 percent in strata I and II, respectively. The corresponding reductions brought about by gemfibrozil were 18 and 17 percent. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was increased by 7 and 9 percent by simvastatin and by 17 and 16 percent by gemfibrozil in strata I and II, respectively. Ratios of low-density to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were reduced by approximately 25 percent by simvastatin 5 to 10 mg once every afternoon and gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily, but were reduced by 37 percent by simvastatin 10 to 20 mg once every afternoon. Both drugs reduced plasma triglyceride levels, but gemfibrozil was much more effective. The short-term tolerability and safety of both drugs appeared to be good during the 12-week study. The results suggest that both drugs have useful but distinctly different lipid-modifying properties.", 
    "20": "The efficacy of simvastatin, a new inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, was studied in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. A mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 38 percent was observed after eight weeks of treatment with 20 mg of simvastatin; a 42 percent reduction was seen after the next 16 weeks with 40 mg. There was no difference in response whether the drug was taken in one or two doses. In another study, simvastatin (40 mg per day) was compared with cholestyramine (8 to 16 g per day). After 12 weeks, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced 43 percent by simvastatin and 29 percent by cholestyramine. Combination therapy caused a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 54 percent. Simvastatin appeared also to be a potent hypolipidemic drug in 10 patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. The drug was well tolerated. Adverse effects were primarily composed of increases in serum transaminases and creatine phosphokinase. No effects of simvastatin on the production of steroid hormones were observed.", 
    "21": "Simvastatin, a hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor intended for use as a hypocholesterolemic agent, has undergone a thorough preclinical toxicology evaluation. This review describes preclinical toxicology findings associated with simvastatin administration in animals and provides the rationale for our conclusion that these changes are not indicative of potential human toxicity. Although it was not surprising to find that a potent inhibitor of this key biochemical pathway produces toxicity at high dosages in animals, none of the observed changes poses a significant risk to humans at clinical dosages. Many of the toxicities produced by high dosage levels of simvastatin in animals are directly related to the drug's biochemical mechanism of action and are the result of a profound, sustained inhibition of the target enzyme that is not anticipated at clinical dosages. Furthermore, several of the simvastatin-induced changes are species-specific responses to this agent and are not relevant to human risk assessment. Of the treatment-related changes reported for simvastatin, the development of cataracts in dogs has received considerable attention. The available data demonstrate a wide margin of safety in terms of dosage levels required to elicit this response as well as the plasma concentrations associated with the development of these ocular lesions. The data suggest that the development of lenticular opacities at clinical doses of simvastatin is highly improbable. Overall, simvastatin is highly improbable. Overall, simvastatin was well-tolerated by animals in preclinical toxicology studies, and no findings contraindicating its use in humans were identified.", 
    "22": "Using a model of coronary heart disease incidence based on multivariate logistic regression functions from the Framingham Heart Study, the cost effectiveness of simvastatin was compared with that of cholestyramine in preventing such disease. For men with initial cholesterol levels of 310 mg/dl, the cost effectiveness of cholestyramine, expressed in Dutch guilders, ranges from approximately 220,000 to 510,000 guilders per year of life saved, depending on age at initiation of therapy. For simvastatin, cost-effectiveness ratios range from 50,000 to 110,000 guilders per year of life saved among this group of men. Results are similar for women, although the cost effectiveness of both agents is considerably less. These results suggest that simvastatin is substantially more cost effective than cholestyramine; that it compares well with other generally accepted medical practices, especially if therapy is initiated at an early age; and that simvastatin should become accepted as a drug of first choice in the treatment of persons with elevated serum cholesterol levels as its long-term safety record becomes more established.", 
    "23": "The basal level of the gene expression and the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase was higher in SV40-transformed human fibroblasts (90-VA VI) than in normal ones (HDF). In both these cell types mevinolin (25 microM) caused an 85-90% depression of HMG CoA reductase activity and of the incorporation of [3H]acetate into sterols. In HDF this was coupled to an efficient block of cell growth, whereas the growth of 90-VA VI was only slightly reduced by mevinolin. In HDF, mevinolin (25 microM) also abolished essentially all dilichol synthesis, as measured by incorporation of [3H]acetate. In contrast, dolichol synthesis remained unaltered, or was increased, in mevinolin-treated 90-VA VI. We suggest that these different responses of dolichol synthesis may depend on different substrate affinities of the rate-limiting enzyme in the dolichol pathway. However, if 90-VA VI was treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), an alternative inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, the cellular growth as well as dolichol synthesis was significantly decreased. Since the inhibitory effect of 25OH on HMG CoA reductase activity did not exceed that of mevinolin, it seems that 25-OH, besides HMG CoA reductase, inhibits steps distal to HMG CoA reductase. This notion was further supported by the finding that addition of mevalonate did not prevent the 25-OH-induced growth inhibition. However, if dolichol was added along with 25-OH, the block was partially prevented, indicating that a critical level of de novo synthesis of dolichol for cellular growth.", 
    "24": "We have demonstrated previously that cultured rat ovarian granulosa cells synthesize and secrete apoE, and this production of apoE is increased by agents that stimulate protein kinase A (cyclic AMP-dependent enzyme) (for example, cholera toxin) and protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) (for example, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, a phorbol ester). In the studies presented in this report, we have examined the effect of changes in cell cholesterol synthesis on the production of apoE by rat ovarian granulosa cells. Mevinolin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis), and 4,4,10 beta-trimethyl-trans-decal-3 beta-ol, an inhibitor of squalene cyclization, both attenuate the cholera toxin or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation of granulosa cell apoE secretion and apoE mRNA content in a dose-responsive manner. The inhibitory effect of mevinolin is reversed by the concomitant administration of mevalolactone, which provides the cells with the product of the reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. Steroidogenesis per se has no effect on apoE production. Aminoglutethimide, which blocks the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis, has no effect on apoE or apoE mRNA. The data indicate that products of HMG-CoA reductase (isoprenes, cholesterol and/or cholesterol metabolites) are required along with stimulators of protein kinases A and C, to regulate ovarian granulosa cell apoE production.", 
    "25": "It has been proposed that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may become very atherogenic if it undergoes a cell-mediated oxidative modification within the arterial wall. Recently, several lines of evidence have been reported that indicate that such oxidative reactions occur in vivo and that oxidized LDL accumulates in lesions. In addition, it has been shown that treatment of spontaneously atherosclerotic Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits with probucol, a very potent antioxidant, inhibits formation or progression of early lesions, suggesting a pathogenic role for oxidized LDL in atherogenesis.", 
    "26": "These studies test the hypothesis that a major determinant of excessive biliary cholesterol secretion is a level of hepatic sterol synthesis that is inappropriately high relative to the needs of the liver cell for preserving cholesterol balance. Biliary cholesterol secretion was measured in vivo in two models after loading the hepatocyte with sterol by two different mechanisms. In the first model, cholesterol was delivered physiologically to the liver in chylomicron remnants. This resulted in a sixfold increase in cholesteryl ester content and marked suppression of cholesterol synthesis, but biliary cholesterol secretion remained essentially constant. In the second model, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase levels in the liver were markedly increased by chronic mevinolin (lovastatin) administration. Withdrawal of the inhibitor resulted in a sudden fivefold increase in the rate of sterol synthesis in the liver of the experimental animals that was inappropriately high for cellular needs. This excessive synthesis, in turn, was accompanied by a fivefold increase in the cholesteryl ester content, enrichment of microsomal membranes with cholesterol and, most importantly, by a threefold increase in the rate of biliary sterol secretion. As the rate of sterol synthesis gradually returned to normal over 48 h, the cholesterol ester content, the lipid composition of the microsomal membranes, and rate of cholesterol secretion into bile also returned to baseline values. These results further support the concept of functional compartmentalization of cholesterol in the hepatocyte. Derangements that cause an inappropriately high rate of sterol synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum may lead to an expansion of that pool of cholesterol that is recruitable by bile acids and, hence, to greater situation of the bile.", 
    "27": "Lovastatin therapy is known to induce hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor mRNA and LDL receptor activity. Yet, in studies in humans and animals it has been difficult to demonstrate an enhancement of the plasma fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of an injected LDL tracer during lovastatin therapy. One explanation may be that the composition of the LDL tracer may also change during therapy, independently affecting LDL clearance. To test this possibility we fed guinea pigs lovastatin, which led to a decrease in their plasma LDL cholesterol levels. Composition studies showed that LDL isolated from lovastatin-treated guinea pigs was slightly cholesterol-depleted and triglyceride-enriched when compared to LDL isolated from control animals. Several independent lines of investigation documented that a substantial increase in hepatic LDL receptor activity occurred in response to the lovastatin treatment. Consistent with this, when a single LDL tracer was injected into control and lovastatin-treated guinea pigs, the FCR was always more rapid in the lovastatin-treated animals. However, when LDL isolated from lovastatin-treated animals (L-LDL) was simultaneously injected intravenously with LDL isolated from control animals (C-LDL) the FCR of the C-LDL was always more rapid than that of the L-LDL. When one compared the FCR of C-LDL determined in control animals with the FCR of L-LDL determined in lovastatin animals there was no difference. Possible explanations for these paradoxical findings are discussed.", 
    "28": "1. We have previously shown that the capacity for specific binding of human 125I-labelled low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to rat hepatocytes increases with time in culture [Salter, Bugaut, Saxton, Fisher & Brindley (1987) Biochem. J. 247, 79-84]. 2. In the present study we show that this up-regulation is accompanied by a rise in the cholesterol ester content of the cells. 3. Inhibition of cholesterol esterification with the drug 58-035 (Sandoz) significantly decreases the time-dependent 'up-regulation' of LDL receptors. 4. Incubation of hepatocytes with LDL itself has little effect on subsequent LDL binding. However, when cholesterol esterification is inhibited, incubation with LDL decreases binding below that attained with the drug alone. 5. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with Lovastatin significantly increases LDL binding and antagonizes the effect of 58-035. 6. We conclude that in hepatocytes the rate of cellular cholesterol esterification can become the major determinant of LDL-receptor activity.", 
    "29": "The effect of chenodeoxycholic (CDCA), ursodeoxycholic (UDCA), tauroursodeoxycholic (TUDCA), cholic (CA), ursocholic (UCA) acids, analogues of CDCA and UDCA with a cyclopropyl ring at C22, C23 (cypro-CDCA and cypro-UDCA) and 23-methylursodeoxycholic acid (MUDCA) on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase was studied in rat liver microsomes. Cypro-analogues consisted of a mixture of four diasteroisomers, while MUDCA was the racemic mixture of two enantiomers. Each steroid was added to liver microsomes at concentrations ranging from 10 to 200 microM. With the exception of UCA and CA, all the bile acids inhibited cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. The inhibition shown by cypro-CDCA and cypro-UDCA was stronger than that observed with the corresponding natural compounds. 22S,23S cypro-UDCA exhibited an inhibitory effect which was more pronounced than that of the diasteroisomer mixture. The isomer 22R,23S was less effective and decreased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in a manner comparable to that of UDCA. The effect of CDCA, UDCA and the cyclopropyl analogues was also tested with respect to HMG-CoA reductase and acylCoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activities. ACAT was stimulated by the isomer 22S,23S cypro-UDCA but not affected by the other bile acids. No effect was observed as regards HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "30": "Drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis have recently been released for lowering LDL-cholesterol levels. The current study examines the effect of one of these drugs, lovastatin, alone and in combination with cholestyramine on postprandial fat metabolism in five patients with severely elevated LDL-cholesterol and normal triglyceride levels (less than 1.8 mmol l-1) and in five patients with similarly elevated LDL-cholesterol and mildly elevated triglyceride levels (1.8 to 2.7 mmol l-1). In the group of patients with normal triglyceride levels, neither lovastatin alone nor in combination with cholestyramine had any effect on postprandial lipoprotein levels, while profoundly decreasing LDL-cholesterol levels. This provides evidence that LDL and postprandial lipoproteins are cleared by different mechanisms. In the group of five patients with mildly elevated triglyceride levels, in addition to LDL-cholesterol lowering, lovastatin significantly lowered VLDL-cholesterol, fasting triglyceride and postprandial lipoprotein levels. Thus in patients with mild hypertriglyceridaemia, lovastatin may have another favourable effect on the lipoprotein system in addition to LDL-cholesterol lowering.", 
    "31": "Pravastatin sodium (CS-514) is a tissue-selective inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. This compound is obtained by microbial hydroxylation of sodium ML-236B (compactin) carboxylate. The soluble cytochrome P-450 was induced by sodium ML-236B carboxylate in Streptomyces carbophilus of Actinomycetes as detected in its cell-free extract. This cytochrome P-450 was designated as cytochrome P-450sca after its origin. Cytochrome P-450sca was purified by successive chromatography on anion-exchange, gel filtration and hydroxyapatite columns. On hydroxyapatite cytochrome P-450sca was further separated into minor and major peaks, designated cytochrome P-450sca-1 and cytochrome P-450sca-2, respectively. Each peak yielded a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gels with molecular masses of 46 +/- 1 kDa. The activity hydroxylating sodium ML-236B carboxylate to pravastatin sodium was reconstituted in the presence of an electron transport system, an NADPH-generating system and oxygen. The Ks values of the cytochromes P-450sca-1 and P-450sca-2 for sodium ML-236B carboxylate were 179 microM and 229 microM, respectively. The CO versus reduced difference spectra of both cytochromes P-450 showed an absorption maximum at 448.5 nm. Their substrate difference spectra with sodium ML-236B carboxylate showed an absorption maximum at 386 nm. Amino acid analysis indicated that cytochrome P-450sca-1 and P-450sca-2 contained 46% and 47% hydrophobic residues, respectively. On Western blotting, cytochromes P-450sca-1 and P-450sca-2 were immunologically identical.", 
    "32": "A capillary gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry method has been developed to measure pravastatin sodium, an anti-hypercholesterolemic agent, and two of its major metabolites in human serum. Injected on a capillary column, derivatized pravastatin sodium and the two, metabolites were detected at levels of 0.5 pg microliters-1 injected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 to 1. The limit of detection was 0.3 ng ml-1 serum of each compound with 95% confidence using a weighted linear regression analysis. Prior to analysis, samples were purified on 200 mg C18 solid-phase extraction columns and derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl bromide and N,O-bis-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide. An excess of pentafluorobenzyl bromide was removed by reaction with propionic acid.", 
    "33": "Measurement of apolipoproteins AI and B-100 has been shown to provide at least equivalent information to measurement of lipoprotein cholesterol levels for evaluating risk of cardiovascular disease. In the present study, the authors examined the relationship between APO B-100 and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in a hypercholesterolemic population that was treated with 16 weeks of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor therapy to lower plasma cholesterol levels. The average decrease in APO B-100 was -0.27 g/L (23% of baseline), which was similar to the decrease in LDL cholesterol, -1.6 mmol/L (-0.61 g/L) (30% of baseline). Correlation data (r = 0.902) indicated that the information provided by the two parameters corresponded in individual cases. Apolipoproteins assayed on automated equipment by kit methods are simpler, more straightforward, and provide more reproducible results than measurement of lipoprotein cholesterols. The authors conclude that, in addition to being more reliable for appraising risk of coronary artery disease, measurement of apolipoproteins may be equally useful for monitoring lipoprotein-lowering therapy.", 
    "34": "The authors examined 18 heterozygotes with familial hypercholesterolaemia and assessed vitamin D metabolites, parameters of phosphocalcium homeostasis and blood lipids. They investigated the effect of the hypolipidaemic drug lovastatin (Mevacor, Merck, Sharpe Dohme, tbl. 20 mg) on the vitamin D metabolism, using increasing doses of 20 to 80 mg per day. They found normal parameters of phosphocalcium homeostasis, normal plasma concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D but low basal values of 25-dihydroxyvitamin D and elevated plasma levels after three months' treatment with MEVACOR. They confirmed at the same time the hypocholesterolaemic effect of the drug. The authors conclude that heterozygotes with familial hypercholesterolaemia may suffer from vitamin D deficiency and that the positive iatropathogenic effect of MEVACOR, a substance inhibiting the activity of 3 hydroxymethylglutarate coenzyme A reductase can have a supporting effect on the vitamin D homeostasis, in particular in old people with vitamin D deficiency.", 
    "35": "Hypercholesterolemia (type II hyperlipidemia) after cardiac transplantation is common and may play a role in the accelerated rate of coronary atherosclerosis seen following the procedure. However, conventional cholesterol-lowering drugs are either ineffective or contraindicated for use in transplant recipients. The presence of type II hyperlipidemia was identified in 11 cardiac transplant recipients during a mean follow-up period of 15 months (range 3 to 41) after transplantation. Lovastatin, at an initial dosage of 20 mg/day, was administered for a period of 1 year. The maximal dosage of lovastatin was 60 mg/day. All patients received maintenance dosages of immunosuppressive agents, including cyclosporine-A, prednisone and, in some instances, azathioprine. Lipid profiles, hepatic transaminases, serum creatinine, creatine kinase and cyclosporine-A serum trough levels were measured quarterly. Total cholesterol decreased by 27% (354 +/- 50 vs 258 +/- 36 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) after 3 months and remained stable thereafter. Similarly, low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 34% (221 +/- 51 vs 146 +/- 40 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) after 3 months and remained constant. Triglycerides, high density lipoprotein, hepatic transaminases, creatinine, creatine kinase and trough cyclosporine-A levels remained stable during the 1-year follow-up period. Lovastatin was uniformly well tolerated in this study group. When given in modest dosages, lovastatin appears to be a safe, effective and well-tolerated therapy for hypercholesterolemia in cardiac transplant recipients.",

The products of the reaction were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Using this method the site of the defect was documented in a patient with deficiency of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, 2 patients with deficiency of 3-methyl-glutaconyl-CoA hydratase, and 2 patients with deficiency of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA lyase.", 
    "37": "Male golden hamsters fed a glucose diet as a model for cholesterol gallstone formation were used to investigate the effect of CS-514 on the lithogenicity of bile. Treatment with 0.05% (w/w) CS-514 in the diet for 1-4 weeks caused a decrease in plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels. A marked increase in hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity in vitro and also an increased de novo cholesterol synthesis in the liver were induced by treatment with CS-514 for 1-4 weeks. The concentration of free cholesterol in liver microsomes and the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity were both decreased by treatment with CS-514 for 1 week, but were not affected by treatment for 4 weeks. The cholesterol output into bile and the lithogenic index of bile were double those of the control (glucose diet only) following treatment with CS-514 for 4 weeks, and the subsequent incidence of cholesterol gallstone formation was elevated. The content of free cholesterol and cholesterol ester in the liver was not affected by treatment with CS-514 for 4 weeks. These results suggest that long-term treatment with CS-514 causes a compensatory increase in the synthesis of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase which leads to augmented hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis and subsequent increased cholesterol output followed by an increase in the lithogenicity of bile. CS-514 apparently does not prevent cholesterol gallstone formation in those examples where the mechanism is thought to be due to augmented hepatic de novo cholesterol synthesis (type IV hyperlipidemia).", 
    "38": "A heat-stable protein inhibitor of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase phosphatase 2A activity has been identified and purified to homogeneity, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular mass was 20,000 Da. The protein lost its inhibitory properties when incubated with trypsin or treated with ethanol. The inhibitor protein does not inhibit type 1 phosphatase when either phosphorylase or hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase is the substrate. In contrast, this protein inhibitor inhibits the rat liver type 2A phosphatase activity when hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase is the substrate but not when phosphorylase a is the substrate. The inhibitor protein is not activated by incubation with ATP and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and it is not phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3. These results, together with those of the kinetic experiments, suggest that the reductase phosphatase inhibitor is distinct from protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 and inhibitor-2.", 
    "39": "An increased susceptibility of platelets to aggregation induced by various agents and a higher production of active arachidonate metabolism have been described in type IIa hypercholesterolemia. This study was designed to evaluate whether changes in platelet function could be observed in hypercholesterolemic patients after synvinolin therapy. Administration of synvinolin to 12 type IIa hypercholesterolemic patients for 24 weeks had a lipid lowering effect and resulted in a marked reduction of platelet aggregation and thromboxane formation induced by collagen and arachidonate. Maximum response was achieved at 4-8 weeks and lipid lowering effects at 2 weeks. This finding indicates that platelet changes cannot be explained by a direct effect of synvinolin on platelets, and the antiplatelet response may therefore depend on platelet membrane lipid composition changes, particularly in the platelet cholesterol content of platelet membranes, following substantial reductions of total plasma cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.", 
    "40": "A patient is described in whom treatment with the cholesterol-lowering agent Lovastatin (Mevacor MSD) led to a slight to moderate elevation of amylase and bilirubin with the occurrence of symptoms attributable to mild pancreatitis. These symptoms were sufficiently severe to require discontinuation of the drug. The concomitant existence of Gilbert's syndrome in this patient may have been causally related to the non-tolerance of this valuable drug. Although a penetrating ulcer cannot be ruled out in the differential diagnosis, the overall evidence favours the diagnosis of Lovastatin pancreatitis, a so far unpublished complication.", 
    "41": "Pathological lesions observed in humans infected with Schistosoma mansoni are due to the eggs produced by the female parasite. Mevinolin, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, blocks egg production by this parasite. In this report, we demonstrate that cholesterol precursors, mevalonate and farnesol, stimulate egg production by the female parasite and that these precursors can reverse the mevinolin-induced inhibition of egg production. Because the parasite cannot synthesize cholesterol, we incubated parasites in a culture media containing radiolabeled acetate with and without mevinolin. We isolated nonsterol lipids from the parasite and observed that mevinolin dramatically reduced the conversion of acetate into the polyisoprenoid (dolichols) lipids of the parasite. Dolichols and other nonsterol lipids did not stimulate egg production. HMG-CoA reductase activity was observed in homogenates of the parasite and was inhibited by mevinolin (Ki = 52 nM), but its activity was tripled when the parasite was chronically exposed to low doses of the drug. Parasites with increased reductase activity produced five to six times more eggs. Lastly, chronic administration of large doses of mevinolin to infected mice resulted in a marked reduction of the pathology associated with the infection. These results suggest that egg production in S. mansoni is associated with the parasite's HMG-CoA reductase activity and that a nonsterol lipid produced in the biochemical pathway regulated by this enzyme stimulates egg production.", 
    "42": "Synvinolin (MK-733), a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) depressing de novo synthesis of cholesterol, was given to BN472 tumor cells in culture medium, 2 days prior to i.v. injection of the cells into syngeneic rats. Another group of rats received cells cultured under the same conditions but without synvinolin. Two different types of culture medium were used, a 'complete' medium (Hybridoma) and a medium (RPMI 1640) to which 1 per cent of fetal calf serum (FCS) was added. Tumor cells cultured in the presence of synvinolin showed significantly lower cholesterol values than untreated cells. Tumor cells treated with synvinolin had a decreased ability to form metastatic nodules when compared with control cells. The results supply further evidence for the suggestion that cholesterol modulates the ability of mononuclear cells to eliminate tumor cells, although it cannot be excluded that alteration of cell growth plays an important role as well.", 
    "43": "Statin, a protein of 57,000 daltons, is present primarily in the nuclei of nonproliferating cells of terminally differentiated tissues or of in vitro aged fibroblast cultures. In young growing cells, the protein can be induced to appear in the nuclei once the cell-cycle traverse is blocked by various tissue culture manipulations, such as serum starvation; this expression, however, can be rapidly removed by addition of serum. The disappearance of statin in cells leaving the quiescent state is not uniform along the periphery of the nucleus; it can be distributed in various patterns, such as caps, nodules, patches, or irregular granules. This unusual distribution seems to suggest that preferential sites exist at the region of the nuclear envelope where statin presence may residually remain. The concentration of statin at the nuclear envelope region in cells at G0-quiescent phase is confirmed by the intense staining of fluorescent antibody at the periphery of isolated rat liver nuclei. Further examination of the isolated nuclei reveals that the protein is associated with the lamina compartment of the nuclear envelope; this is evidenced by the results of immunoblotting experiments showing statin presence in the fraction enriched for lamins A-C. Immunogold labelling studies show that the protein is located in the general area of the nuclear envelope. These results suggest that statin in G0-quiescent cells is located predominantly at the nuclear envelope region and that in this vicinity there may exist geometrically sites of statin concentration as evidenced by the heterogeneous distribution in those cells experiencing the departure from the quiescent state.",

    "45": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-dependent growth of mitogen-activated lymphocytes, inhibited in their capacity to synthesize cholesterol endogenously, can be used as an assay of functional receptors for LDL. Using this technique, abnormalities can be detected in circulating lymphocytes obtained from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Functional lymphocyte LDL receptor activity was decreased in patients with heterozygous FH. Following treatment with the specific inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, lovastatin, alone or in combination with a bile acid-binding resin, there was increased expression of functional lymphocyte LDL receptors in five of nine patients. Plasma LDL cholesterol levels decreased in all nine patients. Three other patients who were only studied while receiving therapy also manifested increased expression of functional lymphocyte LDL receptors. The degree of improvement in plasma LDL cholesterol did not predict the effect on lymphocyte LDL receptor function. Longitudinal studies indicated that an increase in functional LDL receptor activity could be observed with 4 weeks of therapy and persisted for at least 18 months on continuous treatment. These results provide direct evidence that therapy with lovastatin and a bile acid-binding resin can lead to increased expression of functional LDL receptors by lymphocytes in the majority (eight of 12) of patients with heterozygous FH.", 
    "46": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the key enzyme that regulates cholesterol synthesis, lower serum cholesterol by increasing the activity of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. In rat liver slices, the dose-response curves for inhibition of [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol were similar for the active acid forms of lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. The calculated IC50 values were approximately 20-50 nM for all three drugs. Interest in possible extrahepatic effects of reductase inhibitors is based on recent findings that some inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, lovastatin and simvastatin, can cause cataracts in dogs at high doses. To evaluate the effects of these drugs on cholesterol synthesis in the lens, we developed a facile, reproducible ex vivo assay using lenses from weanling rats explanted to tissue culture medium. [14C]Acetate incorporation into cholesterol was proportional to time and to the number of lenses in the incubation and was completely eliminated by high concentrations of inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. At the same time, incorporation into free fatty acids was not inhibited. In marked contrast to the liver, the dose-response curve for pravastatin in lens was shifted two orders of magnitude to the right of the curves for lovastatin acid and simvastatin acid. The calculated IC50 values were 4.5 +/- 0.7 nM, 5.2 +/- 1.5 nM, and 469 +/- 42 nM for lovastatin acid, simvastatin acid, and pravastatin, respectively. Thus, while equally active in the liver, pravastatin was 100-fold less inhibitory in the lens compared to lovastatin and simvastatin. Similar selectivity was observed with rabbit lens. Following oral dosing, ex vivo inhibition of [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol in rat liver was similar for lovastatin and pravastatin, but cholesterol synthesis in lens was inhibited by lovastatin by as much as 70%. This inhibition was dose-dependent and no inhibition in lens was observed with pravastatin even at very high doses. This tissue-selective inhibition of sterol synthesis by pravastatin was likely due to the inability of pravastatin to enter the intact lens since pravastatin and lovastatin acid were equally effective inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity in whole lens homogenates. We conclude that pravastatin is tissue-selective with respect to lens and liver in its ability to inhibit cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "47": "The ability of pravastatin, a new hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, to lower plasma lipid levels and modify lipoprotein patterns was compared with that of gemfibrozil in 18 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who participated in a 16-week, double-blind, parallel trial. Pravastatin proved better than gemfibrozil in lowering total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterolemia: -23.6% and -28.2% versus -18.1% and -21.4%, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the starting level of serum cholesterol (both total and LDL) and the gemfibrozil-induced reduction (r = 0.72 and 0.69), whereas the hypocholesterolemic effect of pravastatin was apparently independent from pretreatment levels (r = 0.32 and 0.10). Apolipoprotein B concentrations were lowered by 25.4% (pravastatin) and 22.0% (gemfibrozil). Pravastatin and gemfibrozil reduced triglyceride levels by 13.9% and 49.4%, respectively. Both drugs increased the level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but this change was significant only with gemfibrozil (p less than 0.05). The HDL subfraction structure and distribution were not modified by pravastatin treatment. Gemfibrozil, in contrast, increased HDL3 cholesterol level by 9% because of an enrichment of HDL3 particles in both free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters and lowered the flotation rate of HDL3 (p less than 0.05). LDL particles became smaller after gemfibrozil treatment (diameter: 25.4 +/- 0.3 nm vs 26.1 +/- 0.4 nm, p less than 0.01) and were not modified by pravastatin. This comparison shows a more pronounced efficacy of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor on total and LDL cholesterol levels, also indicating that pravastatin acts by a single major mechanism, reducing the number of circulating LDL particles. Gemfibrozil may exert additional activities, possibly consequent to the stimulation of very low density lipoprotein catabolism.", 
    "48": "Lovastatin, a lipid-lowering drug which inhibits cholesterol synthesis, was administered to genetically hyperlipidaemic rabbits from the age of 2 months. Twenty rabbits were selected with similar plasma cholesterol levels and divided into matched treatment and control groups. The treated animals showed a 60% decrease in plasma cholesterol due to reduced levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL). Levels of other lipoproteins remained unchanged. In untreated animals cholesterol levels in plasma, LDL and IDL increased with age. The area of aortic atherosclerosis-like lesions was quantified after 2-10.5 months of treatment. At each time point the extent of arterial disease was profoundly less in treated than in untreated animals. The findings demonstrate that primary prevention of arterial lesions resembling human atherosclerosis (increased amounts of fibrous tissue, smooth muscle cell proliferation, foam cell formation and necrosis at the base of the plaques) results from early effective reduction of elevated plasma lipids by lovastatin in this rabbit strain.", 
    "49": "This study describes the efficacy of the drug simvastatin. It is likely to be the first HMG CoA reductase inhibitor in Australia and New Zealand available for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Twenty-four patients, 12 men and 12 women with primary hypercholesterolemia were randomly allocated to treatment by cholestyramine (eight patients) or to simvastatin (16 patients) for a 12-week period. With simvastatin, total cholesterol levels decreased by 37.5% from a baseline mean of 10.33 mmol/L to 6.4 mmol/L after 12 weeks. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration decreased by 48.2% from 8.40 mmol/L to 4.39 mmol/L. These effects were better than observed for cholestyramine alone where cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol reductions were 24.9% and 33.1% respectively. Thirteen patients, however, did not achieve target LDL levels of 3.62 mmol/L, or below, and therefore were treated with a combination of cholestyramine and simvastatin, resulting in a decrease of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol by 45.5% and 53.5% of baseline values studied over an eight-week period. No major clinical side-effects were encountered. One patient appeared to have had a change in colour vision at the end of the study at 20 weeks, without loss of visual acuity.",

Pathological examination revealed hepatic and/or renal disturbance in these animals. These changes are thought to be the cause of deterioration of general condition or changes in serum biochemical examination. All other animals were terminated at the end of the study period.

Excretion of diarrhea and/or loose stool were observed in the more than 50 mg/kg dose group, but the changes are quite mild. Animals of the 800 mg/kg dose group showed vomiting, diarrhea and/or excretion of soft stool and reduction of cholesterol content in serum. In conclusion, it is estimated that the no effective level is less than 200 mg/kg because no abnormalities were observed except for only very slight excretions of diarrhea and/or loose stool, and that the effective dose is 800 mg/kg in which vomiting was observed.", 
    "53": "MK-733 (simvastatin), a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was found to inhibit the absorption of cholesterol from the gastrointestinal tract in cholesterol-fed rabbits (Ishida et al. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 963, 35-41). To clarify the mechanism of action, the effects of MK-733 on acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and cholesterol esterase activities, which are thought to participate in the absorption of cholesterol, were examined. Dietary administration (0.03% in a 1% cholesterol diet for 7 days, approx. 10 mg/kg) of MK-733 to cholesterol-fed rabbits was found to inhibit the increase in serum total cholesterol levels, and caused a 70% reduction in ACAT activity in microsomes of intestinal mucosa relative to those observed in concurrent control rabbits. MK-733 did not affect cholesterol esterase activity in the cytosol of the intestinal mucosa. The inhibitory effect of MK-733 on cholesterol absorption in cholesterol-fed rabbits is though to be related to a reduction in microsomal ACAT activity in the intestinal mucosa.", 
    "54": "In mammalian cells, low density lipoprotein (LDL) is bound, internalized, and delivered to lysosomes where LDL-cholesteryl esters are hydrolyzed to unesterified cholesterol. The mechanisms of intracellular transport of LDL-cholesterol from lysosomes to other cellular sites and LDL-mediated regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism are unknown. We have identified a pharmacological agent, U18666A (3-beta-[2-diethyl-amino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one), which impairs the intracellular transport of LDL-derived cholesterol in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. U18666A blocks the ability of LDL-derived cholesterol to stimulate cholesterol esterification, and to suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and LDL receptor activities. However, U18666A does not impair 25-hydroxycholesterol-mediated regulation of these processes. In addition, U18666A impedes the ability of LDL-derived cholesterol to support the growth of CHO cells. However, U18666A has only moderate effects on growth supported by non-lipoprotein cholesterol. LDL binding, internalization, and lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL-cholesteryl esters are not affected by the presence of U18666A. Analysis of intracellular cholesterol transport reveals that LDL-derived cholesterol accumulates in the lysosomes of U18666A-treated CHO cells which results in impaired movement of LDL-derived cholesterol to other cell membranes.", 
    "55": "In this paper, we assess the relative degree of regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme of isoprenoid biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, by sterol and nonsterol products of mevalonate by utilizing cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells blocked in sterol synthesis. We also examine the two other enzymes of mevalonate biosynthesis, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA synthase, for regulation by mevalonate supplements. These studies indicate that in proliferating fibroblasts, treatment with mevalonic acid can produce a suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity similar to magnitude to that caused by oxygenated sterols. In contrast, HMG-CoA synthase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase are only weakly regulated by mevalonate when compared with 25-hydroxycholesterol. Furthermore, neither HMG-CoA synthase nor acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase exhibits the multivalent control response by sterol and mevalonate supplements in the absence of endogenous mevalonate synthesis which is characteristic of nonsterol regulation of HMG-CoA reductase. These observations suggest that nonsterol regulation of HMG-CoA reductase is specific to that enzyme in contrast to the pleiotropic regulation of enzymes of sterol biosynthesis observed with oxygenated sterols. In Chinese hamster ovary cells supplemented with mevalonate at concentrations that are inhibitory to reductase activity, at least 80% of the inhibition appears to be mediated by nonsterol products of mevalonate. In addition, feed-back regulation of HMG-CoA reductase by endogenously synthesized nonsterol isoprenoids in the absence of exogenous sterol or mevalonate supplements also produces a 70% inhibition of the enzyme activity.", 
    "56": "The effects of treatment of rats with clofibrate, bezafibrate, and ciprofibrate on the hepatic metabolism of cholesterol were studied in rat liver microsomes. HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase activity, regulating cholesterol biosynthesis, was unaffected by clofibrate and ciprofibrate and slightly decreased (20%) by bezafibrate. Also cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, governing bile acid biosynthesis, was unaffected by clofibrate and was reduced by 25-30% in the two other groups of rats. A major new finding was that all three fibric acid derivatives reduced ACAT (acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase) activity, catalyzing the esterification of cholesterol, by 50-70%. The hepatic content of free and esterified cholesterol was determined in the bezafibrate-treated rats. The concentration of microsomal cholesteryl ester was about 60% lower in the treated rats compared to the controls whereas the concentration of total cholesterol was unchanged.", 
    "57": "Progress in archaebacterial molecular biology requires tools for genetic analysis. We describe vectors that can be selected and maintained in either Halobacterium volcanii or Escherichia coli. A genetic determinant for resistance to the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor mevinolin was isolated by \"shotgun cloning\" into a derivative of the endogenous H. volcanii plasmid pHV2, to form pWL2, which transforms sensitive H. volcanii to mevinolin resistance at high frequency. The resistance determinant, portions of pHV2, and an ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistance-conferring pBR322 derivative, pAT153, were ligated together to form the shuttle vectors pWL101 and pWL102. We describe conditions for the use of these vectors and provide preliminary definition of regions essential for drug resistance and for plasmid replication and maintenance.", 
    "58": "Eleven patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (type IIa) were treated by partial ileal bypass. Postoperatively, mean total cholesterol levels fell by 26% at 1 month, and then rose steadily to 20% below preoperative levels of 20-24 months. The rise in cholesterol levels was due in part to an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol with a resultant improvement in the HDL:LDL ratio (LDL, low density lipoprotein). Five patients had refractory hypercholesterolemia and were treated with lovastatin. One of them was treated with a combination of lovastatin and LDL-apheresis. All patients experienced diarrhea which improved with time, but two patients required reversal of their bypass for intractable gas bloat syndrome. Each received lovastatin to control recrudescence of hypercholesterolamia following reversal. Ten patients are alive and well, but one patient died after a myocardial infarction 55 months postoperatively. The advent of lovastatin and other HMG COA reductase inhibitors is likely to decrease the use of partial ileal bypass to treat familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "59": "Plasma testosterone and cortisol concentrations were measured in 32 familial heterozygous hypercholesterolaemic subjects, aged 40-45 years. The subjects were divided into two groups of 16, each containing eight men and eight women. The women had normal menstrual cycles. After a period on placebo, one group of patients was given 40 mg/day lovastatin and the other was given 1500 mg/day clofibrate. Both drugs significantly reduced the plasma cholesterol concentration, however, unlike clofibrate, lovastatin did not decrease plasma levels of testosterone and cortisol. The response to stimulation by adrenocorticotrophic hormone of plasma cortisol and urinary 17-hydroxy levels was significantly reduced by treatment with clofibrate, but unchanged by lovastatin. The different effects produced by the two drugs probably reflect different mechanisms and sites of action.", 
    "60": "Extracorporeal low density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis offers an adjunctive therapy to diet and drug treatment for reducing LDL concentrations in patients with excessively high cholesterol levels and those at high coronary risk. After nearly 4 years experience with the heparin-induced extracorporeal LDL/fibrinogen precipitation (HELP) system, based on heparin induced LDL precipitation at acidic pH, over 7,000 single aphereses have been performed on more than 100 patients in several clinics. Due to the simultaneous removal of LDL and fibrinogen, regular HELP-LDL-apheresis can normalize hemorrheologic parameters, thus explaining the observation of a rapid and lasting clinical improvement in signs and symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD). The use of Simvastatin in combination with HELP significantly augments the reduction in LDL cholesterol to a level where regression of atherosclerotic lesions might be expected.", 
    "61": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and reductase mRNA level were determined in adrenals from hamsters treated with ACTH, with or without cycloheximide or aminoglutethimide. Both reductase activity and reductase mRNA level were similarly enhanced by ACTH administration compared to levels in NaCl-treated animals. The administration of cycloheximide with ACTH resulted in a 73% decrease in reductase activity compared to control values, but did not prevent the enhancing effect of ACTH on the reductase mRNA level. Furthermore, the administration of cycloheximide alone diminished HMG-CoA reductase activity, but enhanced by 1.1- to 1.6-fold the reductase mRNA level. Coadministration of aminoglutethimide with ACTH also resulted in a decrease (65%) in reductase activity compared to that in NaCl-treated animals. However, coadministration of aminoglutethimide, in contrast to cycloheximide, with ACTH not only prevented the reductase mRNA level increase produced by ACTH, but also resulted in a 30% decrease in the reductase mRNA level compared to that in controls injected with 0.15 M NaCl. In addition, aminoglutethimide alone resulted in 50% and 54% decreases in reductase mRNA level and reductase activity, respectively. Thus, we have shown that both cycloheximide and aminoglutethimide can prevent the enhancing effect of ACTH on HMG-CoA reductase activity, but their modes of action differ. It is likely that the aminoglutethimide inhibition could be the result of a diminution of specific reductase gene transcription, whereas cycloheximide would result in inhibition of the synthesis of specific proteins, including HMG-CoA reductase. In this respect, since the adrenal free cholesterol content was increased in groups treated with ACTH-aminoglutethimide, we postulate that free cholesterol could be one of the important components involved in the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene transcription. As for the ACTH-cycloheximide-treated groups, the adrenal free cholesterol content was also increased, but the effect of ACTH on the reductase mRNA level was not prevented, presumably because this drug blocked the synthesis of a putative sterol regulatory protein that is required to repress HMG-CoA reductase gene transcription.", 
    "62": "We have previously demonstrated that cultures of myocytes from embryonic chick atria grown in media supplemented with fetal calf serum from which lipoproteins have been removed demonstrate a nearly 10-fold increase in sensitivity of beating to the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbamylcholine compared with cells grown with control medium. This increased response to carbamylcholine was associated with a 1.4-fold increase in total cell cholesterol, a 2-fold increase in the number of muscarinic receptors which bind agonist with high affinity, and a 2-fold increase in the levels of the alpha subunits of Go and Gi (Haigh, L. S., Leatherman, G. F., O'Hara, D. S., Smith, T. W., and Galper, J. B. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15608-15618). In the studies reported here, we determined the responsiveness of cells grown in lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS) to beta-adrenergic stimulation. Isoproterenol stimulated a contractile response of 58% measured as an increase in amplitude of contraction with a half-maximal effect at 3 x 10(-7) M for cells grown in fetal calf serum, but had no significant effect on amplitude of contraction on cells grown in LPDS. In cells grown in media supplemented with fetal calf serum, isoproterenol (1 x 10(-3) M) stimulated adenylate cyclase activity 100% over basal with an EC50 of 7 x 10(-6) M compared with an increase of 32% in cells grown in media supplemented with LPDS. beta-Adrenergic receptor number as measured by the binding of 125I-pindolol decreased from 24 +/- 3 (+/- S.E., n = 6) fmol/mg protein in cells grown under control conditions to 12 +/- 2 (n = 6) fmol/mg protein in media supplemented with LPDS. The level of alpha s as measured both by ADP-ribosylation with cholera toxin in the presence of 32P-NAD and by immunoblotting with specific antibody to alpha s decreased by 3-fold in cells grown in media supplemented with LPDS compared with control. All of these effects of growth of cells in LPDS were reversed by incubating cells with LPDS plus 30 microM mevinolin, an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. These studies indicate that growth of cells in media supplemented with LPDS results in a coordinate decrease in the levels of beta-adrenergic receptors and alpha s. Taken together with our previous studies these data support the hypothesis that the receptors and guanine nucleotide-binding proteins which mediate sympathetic and parasympathetic responsiveness in the heart are reciprocally regulated.", 
    "63": "Cells incorporate isoprenoid products derived from mevalonate (MVA) into several unique proteins. The aim of this study was to delineate the effects of blocking MVA synthesis on the covalent isoprenylation of these proteins in murine erythroleukemia cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide prevented the incorporation of [3H]MVA into proteins, suggesting that isoprenylation normally occurs immediately after synthesis of the polypeptides. However, incubation of cells with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, for as little as 1 h prior to addition of cycloheximide rendered the isoprenylation step insensitive to cycloheximide. Lovastatin had no apparent effect on the stability of the isoprenylated proteins, but the development of cycloheximide insensitivity during the lovastatin preincubation was dependent on synthesis of new protein during that period. Addition of 50-200 microM MVA to the culture medium eliminated the effects of preincubation with lovastatin. Preincubation of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol, which suppresses the synthesis and enhances the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase but is not a competitive enzyme inhibitor, did not induce cycloheximide-insensitivity of the isoprenylation reaction. The results suggest that blocking MVA synthesis with lovastatin causes a rapid depletion of isoprenoid groups available for protein modification. Consequently, there is an accumulation of non-isoprenylated substrate proteins. Shifts in the ratio of modified vs. unmodified proteins in response to MVA availability may have implications for the changes in cell morphology, cell proliferation and HMG-CoA reductase gene expression that occur when cells are subjected to MVA deprivation.", 
    "64": "Cellular processes responsible for maintaining cholesterol homoeostasis are highly regulated. To determine whether two of these processes, cholesterol biosynthesis and receptor-mediated uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), are co-ordinately regulated in human liver, we employed a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) and measured the accumulation of mRNA for LDL receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase and HMG-CoA synthase under a variety of conditions. Genomic Southern-blot analysis demonstrated that the integrity of these genes is maintained in the transformed cell. Treatment of HepG2 cells with mevalonate, 25-hydroxycholesterol, LDL, lovastatin or miconazole resulted in a similar effect on the accumulation of all three mRNAs at the concentrations tested. The onset of the response to drug, whether repression or induction of mRNA accumulation, occurred after approximately the same period of exposure for each mRNA. We conclude that the expression of the LDL receptor, HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase is co-ordinately regulated in HepG2 cells.", 
    "65": "The feeding of mevinolin plus cholestyramine to rats results in the production of a form of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR-CM) having thiol/disulfide redox properties different from those of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase isolated from animals which had been given only cholestyramine (HMGR-C). The second-order rate constant for the inactivation of HMGR-CM by GSSG is 7-fold slower than for HMGR-C, while the second-order rate constant for the reactivation of oxidized enzyme by GSH is 100-fold slower. However, in the presence of saturating concentrations of both substrates, the rate constants for thiol/disulfide exchange are similar for both forms of the enzyme. HMGR-CM behaves as if a protein-glutathione mixed disulfide having a Kox of 27 +/- 4 is formed at equilibrium. In contrast, HMGR-C has previously been shown to form a protein-protein disulfide (Cappel, R. E., and Gilbert, H. F. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12204-12212). Both forms of the enzyme are more difficult to oxidize thermodynamically in the presence of saturating levels of both substrates. For HMGR-CM, NADPH alone has no effect on the equilibrium constant for oxidation, but hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA alone makes the enzyme approximately twice as difficult to oxidize. Under physiological conditions, HMGR-CM is thermodynamically more difficult to oxidize than HMGR-C. HMGR-C can be converted to HMGR-CM by in vitro treatment with mevinolinate. A direct or indirect interaction of mevinolin with HMGR-C results in some persistent, as yet undefined, structural alteration which inhibits the formation of a protein-SS-protein disulfide upon oxidation by glutathione disulfide.", 
    "66": "5 beta-Cholest-8-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol, prepared by hydroboration of 5 beta-cholesta-8,14-dien-3 beta-ol, was determined to have the 14 alpha-H,15 alpha-OH configuration by comparisons of observed and calculated lanthanide-induced shifts for the 3-tertbutyldimethylsilyl derivative. The 3 beta,15 alpha-diol was found to exist partially in a conformation in which ring B is a 5 beta, 6 alpha-half chair and the axial-equatorial orientation of ring A substituents is reversed. This conformation has been observed previously for 3 beta-(p-bromobenzoyloxy)-5 beta-cholesta-8,14-diene and for some cis-decalin derivatives. 5 beta-Cholest-8-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol was found to be highly active in the lowering of the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells and only slightly less active than the corresponding sterol (5 alpha-cholest-8-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol) with the trans A-B ring junction.", 
    "67": "Relatively high concentrations of MK-733 (simvastatin) and MK-803 (lovastatin, mevinolin), which are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, were found to inhibit acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) of rabbit intestinal microsomes with IC50's of 2.0 x 10(-5) and 3.6 x 10(-5) M, respectively. Dihydroxy acid forms of both MK-733 and MK-803 did not inhibit ACAT activity. A kinetic analysis using a Lineweaver-Burk plot indicated that MK-733 is a competitive inhibitor of ACAT, with a Ki value of 1.2 x 10(-5) M.", 
    "68": "Considerable evidence has accumulated for a role of a nonsteroidal mevalonate product in the regulation of DNA replication and cell division. We report here a similar requirement for mevalonate in a nonreplicative function, that of natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Treatment of NK cells with 10 microM compactin for 48 hr results in a significant inhibition of cytotoxicity which can be completely reversed by treatment with 1 mM mevalonate, but not cholesterol, dolichol, or isopentenyl adenine. Protein and RNA synthesis appear to be involved in this reversal. Treatment with compactin and reversal with mevalonate do not affect the phenotypic distribution of the effector cell population, and the cell type involved in the inhibition and reversal of cytotoxicity is a CD16 (Leu 11)-, Leu 19-positive, large granular lymphocyte. The conjugation of the target and effector cell early in the lytic pathway is inhibited by compactin treatment of the effector cell population, and this inhibition is reversed by mevalonate.", 
    "69": "The effects of lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase), on 24-hour urinary excretion rates of mevalonic acid (an intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis) and plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were evaluated in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). The mean rates of urinary mevalonate excretion of 28 FH patients were initially higher (2.95 +/- 0.29 (+/- SEM) mumols/d) than in 17 control subjects (1.82 +/- 0.12 mumols/d). Patients with FH were treated with sequentially increasing doses of lovastatin (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg daily, taken as a twice daily dosage) for a period of 6 weeks on each dose. When compared to baseline, LDL cholesterol levels fell by 22%, 26%, 30%, and 35% respectively, on these different doses. The mean daily urinary mevalonate excretion decreased from baseline by 19% after 4 weeks on 10 mg daily of lovastatin, 35% on 20 mg, and 31% on 40 mg and 80 mg daily. Similar decreases in urinary mevalonate excretions were observed when patients with FH were treated directly with 40 mg (20 mg twice daily) or 80 mg (40 mg twice daily) mg of lovastatin daily. The magnitude of decrease in LDL cholesterol did not show any significant correlation with the changes in urinary excretion of mevalonic acid. Lovastatin therapy decreases rates of urinary mevalonate excretion (which has previously been shown to reflect rates of cholesterol synthesis) by up to 35% at doses of 20 to 80 mg/d; such a decrease seems unlikely to compromise other important cellular requirements for mevalonate.", 
    "70": "The effects of glycosylation inhibitors on the proliferation of SV40-transformed 3T3 cells (SV-3T3) were examined in vitro. Whereas swainsonine and castanospermine, which inhibit distal steps in the glycosylational processing, exerted marginal or no effects on cell proliferation, a proximal inhibitor, tunicamycin, efficiently decreased the rate of DNA synthesis and also inhibited the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. The inhibitory effects of tunicamycin on cell proliferation could be partially reversed by addition of dolichol, a metabolite in the pathway regulated by HMG-CoA reductase. This finding suggests that tunicamycin exerts at least one of its effects on cell proliferation by modulating the activity of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "71": "The nuclear protein statin, found uniquely in nonproliferating cells, has been previously identified by mouse monoclonal antibodies designated as S-30 and S-44. We report here the screening of various rat tissues for proteins cross-reacting with these antibodies. As revealed by immunoblotting, two polypeptides (mol wt 80 and 57 kDa) and a group of lower-molecular-weight proteins migrating between 34 and 38 kDa were found to react with the anti-statin antibodies. The most prominent immunoreactivity was observed with a 57-kDa protein present in rat liver. Upon further fractionation of the liver protein extract with ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4] the 57-kDa protein, designated as rat liver protein 57 or RLp57, was detected independently with both anti-statin antibodies in the 30 to 60% (NH4)2SO4 fraction. In order to determine whether rat liver protein 57 is indeed specifically recognized by anti-statin antibody S-44, we used RLp57 transferred onto nitrocellulose paper as a specific substrate for the adsorption of the S-44 antibody from ascites fluid. As shown by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy the solution remaining after adsorption failed to stain human fibroblasts. The adsorbed immunoglobulin, however, upon elution revealed statin-specific nuclear staining activity on senescent fibroblasts. These findings suggest that rat liver protein 57 and the human fibroblast statin share similar antigenic determinants recognized by the statin-specific S-44 antibody. Our results indicate furthermore that the statin previously identified in fibroblasts may represent one member of a group of several antigenically related proteins detectable with specific anti-statin antibodies.", 
    "72": "The mRNA levels for HMG-CoA reductase were measured in Chinese hamster lung Dede cells or ovary CHO cells by Northern blot analysis. It was observed that 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased the level of reductase mRNA by 40 to 70% in a 6 hour treatment. Inclusion of cycloheximide in the culture prevented the decrease observed with 25-hydroxycholesterol alone. Pretreatment of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol for 6 hours prior to cycloheximide addition reveals that the protein synthesis inhibitor can return the suppressed levels of reductase mRNA back to control levels. Thus, protein synthesis is required for 25-hydroxycholesterol dependent suppression of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA.", 
    "73": "The characteristics and physiological relevance of the high density lipoprotein (HDL) binding site on unstimulated and mitogen activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes have been investigated. At 37 degrees C, specific binding/uptake of fluorescent (dioctadecylin-docarbocyanine, DiI) HDL was observed by cells from healthy donors as well as by those from low density lipoprotein receptor-defective patients; mitogen activated T-blasts exhibited a markedly elevated DiI-HDL uptake compared to resting T-cells. Binding was saturable at 37 degrees C and of high affinity, with a Kd of 5 x 10(-8) M. It was blocked by anti-apoAI polyclonal antibodies (F(ab)2 fraction), but not by anti-apolipoprotein (apo)E, anti-apoAII, or anti-apoB, and was inhibited competitively by HDL apoproteins and an apoAI-protein A fusion protein. T-cell associated DiI-HDL was increased by trypsin treatment (of the cells) and decreased by activation in the presence of HDL or low density lipoprotein. Comparison of the concentration dependencies of growth promotion and specific cell association of HDL indicated that two mechanisms of lipid exchange may be in operation: one a binding-dependent mechanism of cholesterol exchange, with maximal effect in the HDL concentration range (20-200 micrograms/ml) in which specific binding increases rapidly, and the other a binding-independent exchange of lipids effective at concentrations in which specific binding is saturated (300-5000 micrograms/ml).", 
    "74": "18 patients treated at a specialized consultation centre for disorders of fat metabolism were administered a new-generation hypolipidemic (preparation lovastatin-Mevacor) produced by Merck Sharp and Dohme, which inhibits intracellular synthesis of cholesterol. The study also discusses specific types of heterozygotes with familial hypercholesterolemia representing a homogeneous group of patients with maximum resistance to medication and dietary therapy. Mevacor was administered in increasing doses of 20.40 and 80 mg daily for a three-month period. During therapy cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels significantly decreased, the former from 10.13 to 7.19 mmol/l, the latter from 1.95 to 1.49 g/l. Protective HDL cholesterol significantly increased from 1.01 to 1.23 mmol/l without the triglyceride level indicating any significant change. The course of therapy did not result in any undesirable effects necessitating drug discontinuation. During the clinical testing the patients' weight remained unchanged.", 
    "75": "Mevinolin, putatively a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase, was used to assess the contribution of de novo synthesized cholesterol to androgen production by ovarian thecal cells in vitro. Enzymatically dispersed thecal cells from 3- to 6-mm follicles of prepubertal gilts were incubated at 150,000 cells/ml with a maximally effective dose of LH (250 ng/ml) for 24 h. Mevinolin (3-50 microM) caused dose-dependent inhibition of androstenedione production. Addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol (0.025-25 microM) failed to restore androstenedione production to levels seen in the absence of mevinolin, suggesting an additional site of action of mevinolin beyond 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase. The site of this inhibitory effect was determined by measuring steroid products formed in the presence of relevant steroid precursors. Mevinolin (12 microM) inhibited the production of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone from progesterone and that of androstenedione from 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, while 25-hydroxycholesterol to progesterone and pregnenolone to progesterone conversions were unimpaired. That mevinolin did not affect 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase:delta 5-delta 4-isomerase reactions was confirmed by demonstrating that conversions of pregnenolone, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone to progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and androstenedione, respectively, were not affected by 12 microM mevinolin. These results indicate that mevinolin has an additional inhibitory action at the level of the 17 alpha-hydroxylase:C-17,20-lyase complex. The degree of inhibition of androstenedione production was not decreased with increased concentrations of progesterone or 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone substrate, suggesting that the inhibition was not competitive in nature. As the dose of mevinolin was increased up to 50 microM, progesterone accumulation was unaffected, but pregnenolone concentrations in medium greatly increased. While the mechanism of this effect is unclear, this finding suggests that preformed intracellular cholesterol, rather than that synthesized de novo, is supplying steroidogenic substrate in these cells.", 
    "76": "In incubated blood mononuclear cells from normal subjects bezafibrate inhibited the incorporation of 14C-acetate into squalene, methylsterols and cholesterol. Similarly, the drug produced a sharp decrease of the incorporation of labelled 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) into non-saponifiable lipids, while the incorporation of 14C-mevalonate was unaffected by the presence of bezafibrate in the incubation mixture. This strongly suggests that bezafibrate inhibits HMG-CoA reductase activity. In cultured cells from patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia the presence of bezafibrate in the incubation medium resulted in an inhibition of the incorporation of labelled acetate into non-saponifiable lipids. Bezafibrate then inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis in cells from normal and hypercholesterolaemic patients and this effect is likely, to contribute to the hypocholesterolaemic activity of the drug.", 
    "77": "We evaluated the effects of different doses of lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase) and the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, on parameters of cholesterol homeostasis in freshly isolated mononuclear leukocytes from 19 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Patients were treated with sequentially increasing doses of lovastatin (10 to 80 mg/day in a twice-daily regimen). The in vitro activity of HMG CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis from 2-14C-acetate was determined in mononuclear cells obtained under steady-state conditions after patients had spent 6 weeks on doses of 20, 40, or 80 mg/day. The total and high affinity degradation of 125I-low density lipoprotein (LDL) was determined at baseline and on lovastatin at a dose of 80 mg/day. LDL cholesterol levels fell progressively on lovastatin (38% reduction on 80 mg daily, p less than 0.005). These changes were paralleled by a 121% increase in the activity of HMG CoA reductase (p less than 0.05) and a 39% increase in cholesterol synthesis from 2-14C-acetate (p less than 0.005). Total and high affinity degradation of 125I-LDL increased from 27 +/- 3.3 and 12.1 +/- 1.6 ng/4 x 10(6) cells/4 hours on the diet only to 69.7 +/- 7.2 and 32.9 +/- 3.6 ng/4 x 10(6) cells/4 hours, respectively, (mean +/- SEM) in mononuclear cells isolated from patients on 80 mg of lovastatin daily (p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "Lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase, was investigated in a placebo-controlled trial of 26 primary hypercholesterolemic subjects. Drug dosage varied from 20 to 40 mg/d in a single dose on a 12 weeks treatment period. Average plasma cholesterol reduction levels were 17 and 31%, and LDL-cholesterol 24 and 41% on 20 and 40 mg/d respectively. High-density lipoprotein and triglycerides levels did not change significantly. Similar mean decreases in total plasma cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were observed in hypercholesterolemics irrespectively of being of familial origin or not. No serious clinical and laboratory abnormalities were observed. In this study, lovastatin was a well tolerated and effective agent for the treatment of non familial and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia."
