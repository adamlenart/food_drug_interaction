Controls were identified by incidence density sampling from patients who remained at risk at the date of the HCC diagnosis matched by age and sex. We identified filled statin prescriptions as well as several potential confounding conditions, medications, as well as propensity score to use statins. Odds ratios (ORs) as estimates of the relative risk for HCC associated with statin use and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using conditional logistic regression.",

There were no significant associations between HCC and nonstatin cholesterol- or triglyceride-lowering medications. The unadjusted OR for any statin prescription was 0.46 (95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.517) and the adjusted OR was 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.87). To reduce the potential confounding effect of existing liver disease, we ran the analyses in a subgroup of patients without recorded liver disease; the ORs were slightly attenuated but remained highly significant for any statin prescription (0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.78).",

The influence of lipid-lowering treatments on plasma selenium concentrations and its 9-year change was evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate linear regression models taking into account cardiovascular risk and changes in lipid-profile parameters.

Increased coenzyme Q9 concentrations in the plasma (p < 0.05) and liver (p < 0.01), coenzyme Q10 in the myocardium (p < 0.05) and in the liver (p < 0.01) may indicate adaptation to oxidative stress. Administration of simvastatin (10 mg/kg) to the diabetic-hypercholesterolaemic rats counteracted increased myocardial (coenzyme Q10, p < 0.05) and liver (total coenzyme Q9, p < 0.05) coenzyme Q concentrations but did not improve alpha-tocopherol depletion and increased formation of TBARS in the liver. Even though simvastatin treatment did not induce coenzyme Q deficiency in plasma, heart and liver of the diabetic-hypercholesterolaemic rats as compared to the control levels, it was not able to prevent completely the changes in antioxidant/oxidant balance induced by diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia.

On the contrary, lipid-lowering treatment achieved by ezetimibe is unable to affect endothelial function in these patients.

    "67": "Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin at maximal doses are both highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels. Rosuvastatin has been shown to be more effective than atorvastatin in lowering LDL-C, small dense LDL-C and in raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and its subclasses. Intestinal lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 are also thought to be atherogenic particles. Our purpose in this study was to compare the effects of daily oral doses of atorvastatin 80 mg/day and rosuvastatin 40 mg/day over a 6-week period on serum apo B-48 (a marker of intestinal lipoproteins) and remnant lipoprotein cholesterol (RemL-C) levels (a marker of partially metabolized lipoproteins of both intestinal and liver origin), using novel direct assays in 270 hyperlipidemic men and women. Both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin caused significant (p<0.0001) and similar median decreases in TG (-33.0%, -27.6%), RemL-C (-58.7%, -61.5%), and apoB-48 (-37.5%, -32.1%) as compared to baseline. Our findings utilizing a specific immunoassay and a fairly large number of subjects extend prior studies indicating that statins significantly lower apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins of both intestinal and liver origin.", 
    "68": "This study examined whether stanols can exert their cholesterol lowering effect in renal transplant recipients who develop hypercholesterolaemia. The rise in cholesterol is related to the use of cyclosporine. The study was a randomised parallel-group intervention study. The Intervention group (I) was given three months supply of stanol containing food products. Fasting serum lipids were measured monthly. Parameters that might influence serum cholesterol were measured on all subjects at the start of the study period and at three months. These included body weight, blood pressure and drug therapy, dietary intake, exercise, smoking and alcohol intake. 84 patients completed the study. Cholesterol was reduced in both groups. The difference between control (C) and I group reached significance at p = 0.0196. Reduction in cholesterol in subjects also using statins was greater in the I group. Functional foods appear to be effective in reducing cholesterol in this group of patients. Data collection with respect to other factors that influence CV risk suggests that an overall assessment of diet and lifestyle as well as cholesterol lowering should be undertaken.",

    "73": "This review considers the hypolipidaemic drugs that act on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We searched PubMed up to April 2008 and included randomized controlled trials, original papers, review articles and case reports. Bile acid sequestrants (BAS) have a well-established low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering effect, but may increase triglyceride (TG) levels. BAS have no systematic adverse effects, but are associated with increased GI adverse effects and interactions with the absorption of other drugs. Ezetimibe improves LDL-C, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and TG levels, as monotherapy or especially when given with a statin. Ezetimibe has not been associated with serious adverse effects. Ezetimibe has not been evaluated in large clinical trials with cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints. Phytosterols are not licensed drugs; they have a well-established LDL-C lowering effect, but there are no large long-term randomized clinical trials investigating their effects on CVD events. Orlistat is an antiobesity drug with a small additional LDL-C lowering effect independent of weight loss. Orlistat-assisted weight loss improves the overall lipid profile, carbohydrate metabolism and transaminase activities. However, its use should be limited to weight reduction. This drug is associated with increased GI adverse effects.", 
    "74": "The present review considers the potential pleiotropic effects of statins and the evidence indicative of the \"real world\" benefit from these effects in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Some of these cholesterol-independent effects of statins involve improved endothelial function, stability of atherosclerotic plaques, attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as inhibition of the thrombogenic response. Clinical evidence from early statin administration in acute coronary syndromes and in revascularisation procedures is reported. Moreover, the \"metabolic\" effects of statin treatment, such as renal function improvement and reduction in serum uric acid levels, in patients with stable coronary heart disease are discussed. Evidence suggests that in high CVD risk patient groups pleiotropic effects of statins may play a role in the reduction of morbidity and mortality. However, this concept requires proof in appropriately designed trials that will include clinically relevant end points in order to set specific targets in new CVD-related biomarkers, in addition to lipid levels, that should be used to fully assess the statin contribution to CVD treatment.", 
    "75": "Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, which are prescribed extensively for cholesterol lowering in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Recent compelling evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of statins may not only be due to their cholesterol lowering effects, but also, to their cholesterol-independent or pleiotropic effects. Through these so-called pleiotropic effects, statins are directly involved in restoring or improving endothelial function, attenuating vascular remodeling, inhibiting vascular inflammatory response, and perhaps, stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques. These cholesterol-independent effects of statins are predominantly due to their ability to inhibit isoprenoid synthesis, the products of which are important lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules, such as Rho, Rac and Cdc42. In particular, inhibition of Rho and its downstream target, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK), has emerged as the principle mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of statins. This review provides an update of statin-mediated vascular effects beyond cholesterol lowering and highlights recent findings from bench to bedside to support the concept of statin pleiotropy.", 
    "76": "Oxysterols are a family of 27-carbon cholesterol oxidation derivatives that may be absorbed with the diet or originated endogenously. These cholesterol metabolites are now considered to be potentially involved in the initiation and progression of major chronic diseases including atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative processes, diabetes, kidney failure, and ethanol intoxication. Thus we deemed it of interest to comprehensively analyze the actual relevance of oxysterols, acting through up-regulation of inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis, to human pathology from cell signaling to disease expression; we also review the available literature on related therapeutic prospects. Oxysterols of pathophysiologic relevance generally possess a strong pro-oxidant effect, chiefly since they activate NAD(P)H oxidases. Further, stimulation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway appears to be a common feature of the biochemical effects of this class of compounds. Selective metabolic inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase and the MAPK pathway might quench or even prevent the cytotoxic effects of pathological accumulation of cholesterol oxides in cells and tissues. The marked reduction of plasma oxysterols reported for statin-based therapy is interesting: it has been associated with a lower incidence and prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. Quenching reactive oxygen species' generation seems the likely mechanism exploited by statins against AD incidence and development; intervention with antioxidants might thus also be re-considered as regards molecular \"integrated\" prevention and possible therapy of human \"multifactorial\" disease processes.", 
    "77": "The role of cholesterol as a susceptibility factor or a protective agent in neurodegeneration and, more generally, in amyloid-induced cytotoxicity is still controversial. Epidemiological studies on the hypercholesterolemia-AD risk relation and some reports indicating a beneficial effect of statin therapy suggest cholesterol as a susceptibility factor in AD. The ApoE4 genotype as a prevalent genetic risk factor for AD and the function of ApoE as main cholesterol carrier in the brain also underlie a close cholesterol load-AD risk relation. Finally, cell biology evidences support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP with altered Abeta production. However, little exchange does exist between circulating and brain cholesterol, the latter arising from endogenous synthesis. In addition, increasing evidence supports the idea that amyloid cytotoxicity in most cases is initiated by oligomer recruitment at the cell membrane with loss of membrane integrity, Ca(2+) ingress into the cell, oxidative stress and apoptosis. In such a scenario, increased membrane cholesterol seems to be protective by disfavouring aggregate binding to the membrane. Recent findings also indicate that a reduction of cellular cholesterol favours co-localization of BACE1 and APP in non-raft membrane domains and hinders generation of plasmin, an Abeta-degrading enzyme. Finally, recent researches on Seladin-1, involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, show that modulation of membrane cholesterol affects Abeta generation and cell resistance against Abeta oligomer toxicity. These data confirm previous findings indicating a reduction of the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in aged and AD brains. The aim of this review is to critically discuss some of the main results reported in the recent years in this field supporting a role of cholesterol either as a susceptibility factor or as a protective agent in AD.", 
    "78": "Vasospasm is the major cause of disability and death after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Although the results of 2 randomized clinical trials demonstrated that statin decreases the incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after aSAH, retrospective studies have failed to confirm this. The authors conducted a prospective observational study to determine whether a standardized regimen of simvastatin would reduce the incidence of cerebral vasospasm and improve neurological outcomes in patients with aSAH.",

Starting in September 2005, all patients admitted with aSAH were given enteral simvastatin (80 mg/day for 14 days) in addition to the standard care. The incidence of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm, length of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality rate, and discharge Glasgow Outcome Scale scores in these 170 patients were compared to data obtained in 170 consecutive patients who underwent treatment in our unit prior to the introduction of statin therapy.", 
    "80": "The 5-year study period included 340 consecutively treated patients (170 who received statins and 170 who did not). Patients who received simvastatin therapy were more frequently male (29 vs 20%) and had a smaller median aneurysm diameter (6 vs 7 mm). Baseline characteristics were otherwise similar between the cohorts. There were no differences in the incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (25.3 vs 30.5%; p = 0.277), in-hospital mortality rate (18 vs 15%; p = 0.468), length of hospitalization (21 +/- 15 vs 19 +/- 12 days; p = 0.281), or poor outcome at discharge (Glasgow Outcome Scale Scores 1-2: 21.7 vs 18.2%; p = 0.416) between the simvastatin and nonstatin cohorts. There were no statin-related complications.",

    "82": "In survival analysis, treatment effects are commonly evaluated based on survival curves and hazard ratios as causal treatment effects. In observational studies, these estimates may be biased due to confounding factors. The inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) method based on the propensity score is one of the approaches utilized to adjust for confounding factors between binary treatment groups. As a generalization of this methodology, we developed an exact formula for an IPTW log-rank test based on the generalized propensity score for survival data. This makes it possible to compare the group differences of IPTW Kaplan-Meier estimators of survival curves using an IPTW log-rank test for multi-valued treatments. As causal treatment effects, the hazard ratio can be estimated using the IPTW approach. If the treatments correspond to ordered levels of a treatment, the proposed method can be easily extended to the analysis of treatment effect patterns with contrast statistics. In this paper, the proposed method is illustrated with data from the Kyushu Lipid Intervention Study (KLIS), which investigated the primary preventive effects of pravastatin on coronary heart disease (CHD). The results of the proposed method suggested that pravastatin treatment reduces the risk of CHD and that compliance to pravastatin treatment is important for the prevention of CHD.", 
    "83": "We report the case of a patient who exhibited severe acute hepatitis with symptomatic cholestasis for more than 3 months and bile duct injury following the prescription of atorvastatin. After withdrawal the drug, the patient's wellbeing slowly improves and biological features normalize in 4 months. Therapy aimed at treating severe liver steatosis and hypercholesterolemia. Atorvastatin is a highly effective 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutamyl- coenzyme A reductase (statin) used to lower low-density lipoprotein. Reported frequent adverse events of the medication include nausea, depression, myalgia, abdominal pain and abnormal liver function tests. Although abnormal liver function tests is not an uncommon side effect of the medication, more serious liver injury is rare. In a recent literature review, about ten cases of serious hepatotoxicity have been documented. In the typical presentation, the duration of exposure prior to hepatic toxicity is variable. Liver injury is generally of the mixed type. A prolonged cholestasis for more than 3 months has been seldom reported. Morphological changes includes canalicular cholestasis, feathery degeneration but no cholangiolitis nor cholangitis under the form of cytological and inflammatory changes at the level of interlobular bile ducts. This case report provides further evidence that among statins, atorvastatin may be implicated in drug-induced liver injury and indicates for the first time that such liver injury may be followed by prolonged cholestasis and interlobular bile duct injury. Atorvastatin has thus to be added to the list of medication potentially responsible for bile duct injury.", 
    "84": "Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to reduce the impact of treatment-selection bias when estimating causal treatment effects using observational data. Several propensity-score matching methods are currently employed in the medical literature: matching on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width either 0.2 or 0.6 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score; matching on the propensity score using calipers of 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.1; and 5 --> 1 digit matching on the propensity score. We conducted empirical investigations and Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the relative performance of these competing methods. Using a large sample of patients hospitalized with a heart attack and with exposure being receipt of a statin prescription at hospital discharge, we found that the 8 different methods produced propensity-score matched samples in which qualitatively equivalent balance in measured baseline variables was achieved between treated and untreated subjects. Seven of the 8 propensity-score matched samples resulted in qualitatively similar estimates of the reduction in mortality due to statin exposure. 5 --> 1 digit matching resulted in a qualitatively different estimate of relative risk reduction compared to the other 7 methods. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we found that matching using calipers of width of 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score and the use of calipers of width 0.02 and 0.03 tended to have superior performance for estimating treatment effects.",

Previous studies have suggested that lipoprotein glomerulopathy might be related to APOE gene mutation. No effective therapeutic regimen has been established for lipoprotein glomerulopathy. We report the first case of biopsy-proven lipoprotein glomerulopathy in Hong Kong in a patient who presented with nephrotic syndrome and dyslipidaemia. DNA analysis revealed apolipoprotein E Kyoto together with a novel apolipoprotein E mutation, apolipoprotein E (Asp230Tyr) Hong Kong.

    "90": "The statins are highly effective in lowering cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase. Recently, there has been conflicting epidemiologic data indicating that statins decrease the incidence of certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. Atorvastatin and lovastatin, statins with different lipophicilities, were administered in diet either as single agents or in combination with suboptimal doses of tamoxifen or the retinoid X receptor agonist bexarotene were evaluated for prevention of estrogen receptor-positive mammary cancers induced in the rat with methylnitrosourea. Atorvastatin (125 or 500 mg/kg diet) alone did not significantly alter cancer incidence or multiplicity. Suboptimal doses of tamoxifen (0.4 mg/kg diet) or bexarotene (80 mg/kg diet) reduced cancer multiplicity from 3.8 (control) to 2.9 and 0.9, respectively. Combining atorvastatin (500 mg/kg diet) with either of these effective agents minimally altered their efficacy. Although this dose of atorvastatin did not decrease serum triglyceride levels in control rats, it significantly decreased triglyceride levels that had been increased in bexarotene-treated rats. Experiments done with a second statin, lovastatin (100 and 400 mg/kg diet), yielded similar results: (a) limited activity when administered alone, (b) no obvious synergy with bexarotene, and (c) an ability to decrease bexarotene-induced increases in serum triglycerides. Thus, the statins had minimal activity in this model of mammary cancer in which approximately half of the cancers are mutated in the Ha Ras oncogene. Similarly, atorvastatin failed to alter the development of estrogen receptor-negative mammary carcinomas in a new animal model using bitransgenic mice (MMTV-Neu(+/-)/p53KO(+/-)), whereas bexarotene (250 mg/kg diet) was effective.",

This multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled study evaluated ABT-335 (fenofibric acid) in combination with 2 doses of atorvastatin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. A total of 613 patients with LDL cholesterol > or =130 mg/dl, TG > or =150 mg/dl, and HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dl for men and <50 mg/dl for women were randomly assigned to ABT-335 (135 mg), atorvastatin (20, 40, or 80 mg), or combination therapy (ABT-335 + atorvastatin 20 or 40 mg) and treated for 12 weeks. Combination therapy with ABT-335 + atorvastatin 20 mg resulted in significantly greater improvements in TG (-45.6% vs -16.5%) and HDL cholesterol (14.0% vs 6.3%) compared with atorvastatin 20 mg and LDL cholesterol (-33.7% vs -3.4%) compared with ABT-335. Similarly, significantly greater improvements were observed with ABT-335 + atorvastatin 40 mg in TG (-42.1% vs -23.2%) and HDL cholesterol (12.6% vs 5.3%) compared with atorvastatin 40 mg and LDL cholesterol (-35.4% vs -3.4%) compared with ABT-335 monotherapy. Combination therapy also improved multiple secondary variables. Combination therapy was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with those of ABT-335 and atorvastatin monotherapies. No rhabdomyolysis was reported. In conclusion, ABT-335 + atorvastatin combination therapy resulted in more effective control of multiple lipid parameters than either monotherapy and may be an appropriate therapy for patients with mixed dyslipidemia.", 
    "100": "Recent data indicated that statin therapy may fail to reduce the incidence of coronary events in patients concomitantly using beta blockers. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the concomitant use of beta blockers would modify the anti-inflammatory action of statins. Changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) between days 1 and 5 after myocardial infarction were evaluated in 189 patients treated with simvastatin alone (S), beta blockers alone (B; propranolol or metoprolol), S + B, or neither of these 2 medications (N) in a prospective observational cohort. At baseline, median CRP was lower in the S group (0.40 mg/dl, interquartile range 0.1 to 0.6) than the other groups (B: 0.6 mg/dl, interquartile range 0.4 to 1.6; S + B: 0.5 mg/dl, interquartile range 0.3 to 1.2; and N: 0.6 mg/dl, interquartile range 0.2 to 1.5). By day 5, median CRP was 1.3 mg/dl (interquartile range 0.7 to 2.6), 4.3 (interquartile range 1.6 to 8.8), 4.6 (interquartile range 2.8 to 9.5), and 4.4 (interquartile range 1.9 to 9.9) for the S, B, S + B, and N groups, respectively. After adjusting for log(e) baseline CRP, the difference in log(e) CRP between days 1 and 5 was significantly lower in the S group compared with the B (-0.74 +/- 0.23 [SE], p = 0.001) or S + B group (-0.99 +/- 0.20 [SE], p <0.0001). The significance remained after adjustment for age, gender, and baseline CRP. There was no significant difference in change in CRP between the SB and B groups. In conclusion, the present study confirmed the anti-inflammatory action of statins and showed that concomitant use of beta blockers may significantly attenuate this effect.", 
    "101": "In addition to inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis, statins also inhibit the formation of isoprenoid intermediates, which are required for the activation of the Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway. Increased ROCK activity has been implicated in causing endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. However, it is not known whether statins, at doses used to lower cholesterol levels, inhibit ROCK activity in humans with atherosclerosis. Furthermore, it is not known whether lipophilic and hydrophilic statins differ in their ability to inhibit ROCK activity. Accordingly, we enrolled 30 men with stable atherosclerosis (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] > or =100 mg/dL) in a randomized, double-blind study comparing equivalent LDL-lowering doses of a hydrophilic statin (rosuvastatin 10 mg once a day) with a lipophilic statin (atorvastatin 40 mg once a day) for 28 days. We assessed the change in lipids, ROCK activity, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery before and after statin therapy. Both treatment groups exhibited comparable 30% to 32% and 42% to 45% reductions in total and LDL cholesterol, respectively. Only atorvastatin reduced triglycerides, and neither statin altered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Whereas both statins inhibited ROCK activity (p <0.0001), the extent of inhibition was greater with rosuvastatin (18 +/- 2% vs 8 +/- 2%, p = 0.0006). Statins also improved FMD from 7.4 +/- 0.6 to 9.3 +/- 0.4 (p = 0.003) with rosuvastatin being slightly better than atorvastatin. The inhibition of ROCK activity by statins did not correlate with reductions in LDL (p = 0.57) but was associated with improvement in FMD. In conclusion, these findings provide direct clinical evidence that statins, at clinically relevant doses, could differentially inhibit ROCK activity and improve endothelial function by cholesterol-independent mechanism.",

Nineteen subjects with low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dl), nine of whom were also treated with 20 mg of atorvastatin daily, received placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 120 mg of torcetrapib daily for the next 4 weeks. Six subjects in the nonatorvastatin cohort participated in a third phase, in which they received 120 mg of torcetrapib twice daily for 4 weeks. At the end of each phase, subjects underwent a primed-constant infusion of [5,5,5-(2)H(3)]L-leucine to determine the kinetics of HDL apoA-II. Relative to placebo, torcetrapib significantly increased apoA-II concentrations by reducing HDL apoA-II catabolism in the atorvastatin (-9.4%, P < 0.003) and nonatorvastatin once- (-9.9%, P = 0.02) and twice- (-13.2%, P = 0.02) daily cohorts. Torcetrapib significantly increased the amount of apoA-II in the alpha-2-migrating subpopulation of HDL when given as monotherapy (27%, P < 0.02; 57%, P < 0.003) or on a background of atorvastatin (28%, P < 0.01). In contrast, torcetrapib reduced concentrations of apoA-II in alpha-3-migrating HDL, with mean reductions of -14% (P = 0.23), -18% (P < 0.02), and -18% (P < 0.01) noted during the atorvastatin and nonatorvastatin 120 mg once- and twice-daily phases, respectively. Our findings indicate that CETP inhibition increases plasma concentrations of apoA-II by delaying HDL apoA-II catabolism and significantly alters the remodeling of apoA-II-containing HDL subpopulations.",

Hypercholesterolemia occurred in the graft recipient within one yr after transplantation and was partially controlled by atorvastatin. Three yr after transplantation, an autologous CD34(+) cell transplantation was performed in order to better control the hypercholesterolemia. Only preliminary results of this domino liver transplantation (DLT) were published in 2003, without a long-term analysis of the hypercholesterolemic effects in recipient. Subsequent to DLT, the average plasma cholesterol level in the domino donor rapidly normalized and seven yr after had a value of 182 mg/dL. After seven-yr follow-up, the domino recipient has no hepatocarcinoma recurrence. Moreover, no signs of cardiovascular or atherosclerotic lesions were noted despite an elevated plasma cholesterol level (339 mg/dL after seven yr of follow-up) resistant to drug therapy and stem cell autotransplantation. In conclusion, DLT using a liver graft from a patient with HFHC provides a viable option for marginal recipients.", 
    "127": "The process of demyelination occurring in diseases as multiple sclerosis is usually investigated in animal models. A major drawback of animal models is that only one condition can be tested per animal, necessitating many animals and systemic effects are factors to be considered. The aim of the study was to develop a reproducible in vitro model for de- and remyelination using whole brain spheroid cultures and lysophosphatidyl choline (LPC). In spheroid cultures, single cell suspensions of embryonic day 15 rodent brain cells reaggregate under constant rotation. Three-dimensional contacts form between the central nervous system cell types present. Multilayered myelin is maximal in four-week old cultures. A week of repeated exposure to LPC led to 30% loss of MBP protein concentration and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase activity measurements in both rat and mouse spheroids and 56% loss in the number of myelin sheets, with partial remyelination after a week of recovery. The number of dividing cells was increased after LPC exposure and oligodendrocytes were shown to be among the dividing cells. Microglia and astrocytes were not affected and neurons were relatively spared. This suggests that LPC toxicity is specific for myelin and oligodendrocytes. LPC toxicity could be decreased using cholesterol and simvastatin, suggesting that LPC works through altering membrane composition. Thus, in different rodent species and using different read-outs, we could reproducibly show de- and remyelination in spheroid cultures after LPC exposure. This model for demyelination with potential for remyelination offers possibilities for testing novel therapies and studying mechanisms of remyelination.",

Higher molecular weight samples exhibited lower degree of crystallinity and melted at lower temperatures. Melting of the polymer appeared to begin at 38 degrees C. PPSu cytocompatibility was investigated based on human umbilical vein endothelial cells viability in the presence of increasing concentrations of polymer, and it was found that PPSu exhibited comparable cytocompatibility with poly(DL-lactide). The feasibility of applying PPSu as a drug carrier was shown for the first time, as solid dispersions and nanoparticles of sodium fluvastatin based in PPSu were prepared. Drug release rates decreased with increasing the molecular weight of PPSu in both solid dispersions and nanoparticles. For dispersions prepared from PPSu of the same molecular weight, drug release rates increased with drug loading. It appears that PPSu applicability as a drug carrier warrants further consideration.",

We investigated the associations of several haemostatic markers (fibrinogen, D-dimer, FV, FVII, FVIII, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and antithrombin III) with two quantitative measures of vascular disease in adults with hypertension. Participants included 1051 African Americans (65+/-9 years, 72% women) and 894 non-Hispanic whites (61+/-9 years, 55% women) belonging to hypertensive sibships. Phenotypes of vascular disease included the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a measure of peripheral arterial disease, and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), a surrogate of glomerular endothelial function. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess whether plasma levels of haemostatic markers were associated with measures of arteriosclerosis, after adjustment for conventional risk factors and medication (statin, aspirin and oestrogen) use. Higher fibrinogen and D-dimer were significantly associated with lower ABI in African Americans (P<0.001 and 0.004 respectively) and in non-Hispanic whites (P<0.001 and 0.010 respectively). Higher fibrinogen (P<0.001), D-dimer (P=0.003), FVIII (P<0.001) and vWF (P<0.001) were significantly associated with higher UACR in African Americans, whereas, in non-Hispanic whites, higher fibrinogen (P=0.020) and FVII (P=0.006) were significantly associated with higher UACR.

The metaanalysis could not be performed for many side effects of statins, but individual trials showed no significant side effects. Quality assessment showed methodologic concerns, with potential for bias. For example, six trials analyzed statin effects without intention to treat despite such a stated intention.

    "163": "The liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed for the accurate quantitation of metoprolol succinate (MET) and simvastatin (SIM) in human plasma which were obtained from the pharmacokinetic (PK) study. The sample purification and pre-concentration was performed by protein precipitation technique using propranolol hydrochloride as working internal standard (WIS). The chromatographic separation was achieved using an isocratic mobile phase consisting of a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.5% formic acid (90:10 (v/v), pH 3.5) flowing through C18 column at a flow rate of 0.2ml/min. Electro spray ionization (ESI) with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used to acquire mass spectra. Ions were monitored in positive mode and the mass transitions measured were m/z 268.1-->m/z 103.2, m/z 441.3-->m/z 325.1 and m/z 260.0-->m/z 129.5 for MET, SIM and WIS, respectively. An extensive pre-study method validation was carried out in accordance with USFDA guidelines. The linearity for the calibration curve in the concentration range of 1.0-500.0 and 0.1-20ng/ml for MET and SIM, respectively and the lower limits of quantitations (LLOQ) were 1.0 and 0.1ng/ml for MET and SIM, respectively. The method was successfully applied to a PK study on fixed dose combination (FDC) tablet containing MET and SIM in healthy human subjects.", 
    "164": "Statins - inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase - are known to reduce blood cholesterol levels. In this paper, we present a Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system, which enables quick evaluation of the sensitivity of the wild-type and/or mutant forms of human HMG-CoA reductase towards statins or other drugs.", 
    "165": "We analysed the sequence of the HMG-CoA reductase gene in DNA extracted from blood samples of 16 patients with cardiovascular disorders. We applied the yeast system to examine the sensitivity of the wild-type and mutated versions of the hHMG-CoA reductase to different types of statins.", 
    "166": "The yeast and mammalian HMG-CoA reductases demonstrate structural and functional conservation, and expression of human HMG-CoA reductase in yeast complements the lethal phenotype of strains lacking the HMG1 and HMG2 genes.", 
    "167": "These data indicate that a yeast expression system can serve to study the influence of selected mutations in human HMG-CoA reductase on the sensitivity of the enzyme to commonly prescribed statins. Our results suggest that this model system is suitable for the development and selection of lipid-lowering drugs as well as for the examination of DNA sequence variations in the context of statin therapy.", 
    "168": "The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo effects of pravastatin on the development of obesity and diabetes in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice.", 
    "169": "We examined food intake, body-weight changes, visceral white adipose tissue (WAT) adiponectin and resistin levels, and energy metabolism.", 
    "170": "Treatment with 100 mg/kg/day pravastatin for 28 days decreased diet-induced weight gain and visceral adiposity. In addition, the weight of the WAT, the triglyceride (TG) contents of the liver and muscles, and the levels of serum insulin improved in the pravastatin-treated DIO mice. Furthermore, pravastatin treatment changed the WAT adiponectin and resistin mRNA expression and serum levels compared with the controls. Finally, pravastatin treatment increased oxygen consumption and decreased the respiratory quotient (RQ).", 
    "171": "Pravastatin treatment prevents the development of obesity and diabetes in DIO mice. The prevention of obesity may be mediated by increased oxygen consumption and a decrease in the RQ. These results provide novel insights into the use of pravastatin as a therapeutic tool for metabolic syndromes.", 
    "172": "Macrophages are an important natural target cell for HIV-1, but previous studies of virus entry into these cells are limited, and the involvement of membrane cholesterol and lipid rafts is unknown. Cholesterol disruption of macrophage membranes using four pharmacological agents acting by different mechanisms: methyl-beta cyclodextrin, nystatin, filipin complex and Lovastatin, all significantly inhibited productive HIV entry and reverse transcription. The inhibitory effects of these drugs resulted in decreased virus release from infected cells, and could be substantially reversed by the addition of water-soluble cholesterol. The virus bound equally to cholesterol-disrupted cells even though HIV receptor expression levels were significantly reduced. Macrophage CD4 and CCR5 were found to partition with the detergent-resistant membranes with a typical raft-associating protein flotillin-1. HIV particles were observed co-localising with a marker of lipid rafts (CTB-FITC) early post infection. These data suggest that macrophage membrane cholesterol is essential for HIV entry, and implicate lipid raft involvement.", 
    "173": "High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are inversely associated with cardiovascular risk. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition is one strategy for increasing HDL-C. This study evaluated the lipid-altering efficacy and safety of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor anacetrapib as monotherapy or coadministered with atorvastatin in patients with dyslipidemia.", 
    "174": "A total of 589 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed hyperlipidemia (53.8% of the study population had low HDL-C) were randomized equally to one of 10 groups: 5 groups received background statin therapy of atorvastatin 20 mg and 5 did not, and each of these was randomized to placebo, anacetrapib 10, 40, 150, and 300 mg once daily for 8 weeks. An equal proportion of patients had triglycerides >150 mg/dL in each group.", 
    "175": "For placebo and anacetrapib monotherapy (10, 40, 150, and 300 mg), least squares mean percent changes from baseline to week 8 for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were 2%, -16%, -27%, -40%, and -39%, respectively, and for HDL-C were 4%, 44%, 86%, 139%, and 133%, respectively (P < .001 vs placebo for all doses). Coadministration of anacetrapib with atorvastatin produced significant incremental LDL-C reductions and similar HDL-C increases versus atorvastatin monotherapy. For both anacetrapib monotherapy and coadministration with atorvastatin, the LDL-C reductions were similar in patients with baseline triglyceride levels greater than and less than or equal to the median. Anacetrapib was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events was similar for placebo and all active treatment groups. There were no increases in systolic or diastolic blood pressure in any treatment arm.", 
    "176": "Anacetrapib, as monotherapy or coadministered with atorvastatin, produced significant reductions in LDL-C and increases in HDL-C; the net result of treatment with anacetrapib + atorvastatin was approximately 70% lowering of LDL-C and more than doubling of HDL-C. Anacetrapib was generally well tolerated with no discernable effect on blood pressure.", 
    "177": "Dietary intake of polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids has been associated with a reduced incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. The protective mechanisms involved are not fully understood, but may include anti-inflammatory factors. We sought to investigate the relationship between n-3 fatty acid levels in erythrocyte membranes and markers of systemic inflammation in 992 individuals with stable coronary artery disease.", 
    "178": "Cross-sectional associations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (Il-6) with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EHA) were evaluated in multivariable linear regression models adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, medication use, exercise capacity, body-mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio.", 
    "179": "After multivariable adjustment, n-3 fatty acid levels (DHA+EPA) were inversely associated with CRP and IL-6. The inverse association of n-3 fatty acids with CRP and IL-6 was not modified by demographics, body-mass index, smoking, LDL-cholesterol, or statin use (p values for interaction>0.1).", 
    "180": "In patients with stable coronary artery disease, an independent and inverse association exists between n-3 fatty acid levels and inflammatory biomarkers. These findings suggest that inhibition of systemic inflammation may be a mechanism by which n-3 fatty acids prevent recurrent cardiovascular events.", 
    "181": "Preclinical studies suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) may attenuate organ dysfunction. We evaluated whether statins are associated with attenuation of lung injury and prevention of associated organ failure in patients with ALI/ARDS.", 
    "182": "From a database of patients with ALI/ARDS, we determined the presence and timing of statin administration. Main outcome measures were the development and progression of pulmonary and nonpulmonary organ failures as assessed by changes in PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) between days 1 and 7 after the onset of ALI/ARDS. Secondary outcomes included ventilator free days, ICU and hospital mortality, and lengths of ICU and hospital stay.", 
    "183": "From 178 patients with ALI/ARDS, 45 (25%) received statin therapy. From day 1 to day 7, the statin group showed less improvement in their PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (27 vs. 55, P = 0.042). Ventilator free days (median 21 vs. 16 days, P = 0.158), development or progression of organ failures (median DeltaSOFA 1 vs. 2, P = 0.275), ICU mortality (20% vs. 23%, P = 0.643), and hospital mortality (27 vs. 37%, P = 0.207) were not significantly different in the statin and non-statin groups. After adjustment for baseline characteristics and propensity for statin administration, there were no differences in ICU or hospital lengths of stay.", 
    "184": "In this retrospective cohort study, statin use was not associated with improved outcome in patients with ALI/ARDS. We were unable to find evidence for protection against pulmonary or nonpulmonary organ dysfunction.", 
    "185": "Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Several pharmacological agents have been developed over the past 50 years which target various lipid components such as low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Similar to other risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, the management of dyslipidemia can be complicated and may require combination therapy for effective treatment. This review discusses the biochemical mechanisms of action and clinical uses for simvastatin (the most widely available and commercially prescribed statin) and niacin, and the combination of these agents in the management and treatment of dyslipidemia.", 
    "186": "Mixed dyslipidemia is a common lipid disorder characterized by the presence of an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype due to abnormalities in various atherogenic and anti-atherogenic lipoproteins. Despite the link between the decrease of LDL-cholesterol by statin treatment and the prevention of cardiovascular disease, a high residual risk is observed in statin trials. This residual risk is partly explained by lipoprotein abnormalities other than LDL. Fenofibrate exerts a favorable effect on the atherogenic lipid profile of mixed dyslipidemia and can effectively reduce cardiovascular disease in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. Fenofibrate may offer important treatment alternatives as a second-line therapy in several circumstances: in combination with a statin for patients with mixed dyslipidemias not at goals on statin mono-therapy; in monotherapy for patients intolerant or with contraindication to statin therapy; and in combination with other drugs (ezetimibe, colesevelam) for patients with mixed dyslipidemias, known intolerance, or contraindication to statin and not at goals on fenofibrate monotherapy. However, the role of fenofibrate-statin therapy and of other therapies involving fenofibrate in cardiovascular risk reduction strategies remains to be established.", 
    "187": "Thyroid hormone receptor (TR) agonists are in clinical trials for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. As statins are the standard of clinical care, any new therapies must have adjunctive activity, when given in combination with statins. As already known for the statins, the cholesterol lowering effect of TR activation involves increased expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Using animal models, we tested whether TR activation would have additive cholesterol lowering activity in the presence of effective doses of a statin.", 
    "188": "We evaluated the activity of a liver-targeted prodrug, MB07811, of a novel TH receptor beta agonist, MB07344, as monotherapy and in combination with atorvastatin in rabbits, dogs and monkeys.", 
    "189": "In rabbits, MB07344 (i.v.) decreased total plasma cholesterol (TPC) comparable to that achieved with a maximally effective dose of atorvastatin (p.o.). The addition of MB07344 to atorvastatin resulted in a further decrease in TPC. Similarly, the addition of MB07811 (p.o.) to atorvastatin treatment decreased TPC beyond the level achieved with either agent as monotherapy. In dogs and monkeys, atorvastatin and MB07811 were administered as monotherapy or in combination. Consistent with the rabbit studies, the combination treatment caused a greater decrease in TPC than either MB07811 or atorvastatin administered as monotherapy.", 
    "190": "We conclude that the effects of MB07811 and atorvastatin in lowering cholesterol are additive in animals. These results would encourage and support the demonstration of similarly improved efficacy of combination versus monotherapy with such agents in the clinic.", 
    "191": "Research suggests that statins could be useful to treat vascular manifestations related to systemic sclerosis, but data on their potential clinical benefits remain limited. Previous studies suggested that statins increase the number of circulating endothelial precursor cells, and thereby improve the severity of Raynaud's phenomenon. Abou-Raya et al. have published the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on the effect of statins on clinical outcomes in the vascular manifestations of systemic sclerosis. They observed significant reductions in the overall number of digital ulcers and in the mean number of new digital ulcers per patient in the statin group. In addition, statin-treated patients experienced significant improvements in disability scores and functional status. The data from this study indicate that statins might improve endothelial function, thereby contributing to clinical, functional recovery. These results pave the way for large studies on the use of statins in vascular complications related to systemic sclerosis.", 
    "192": "Intra- and inter-ethnic differences in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of clinically relevant drugs are important issues not only for scenes of appropriate drug use in clinical settings but also for those of the drug development. Pharmacogenomics is extremely useful for understanding these racial differences. In this presentation, I will introduce pharmacogenomic concepts (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotype) for interpretation of racial differences in some drugs; pharmacogenomics of drug transporters such as OATP1B1 (organic anion transporting-polypeptide 1B1) and OCT1 (organic cation transporter 1) in pravastatin, metformin, and rosuvastatin will be discussed as model drugs.", 
    "193": "High levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are an independent cardiovascular marker, which may be reduced by statin therapy. JUPITER is a randomised clinical trial that compares the effects of rosuvastatin 20 mg (n = 8901) and placebo (n = 8901) in apparently healthy individuals, without hyperlipidaemia (LDL < 130 mg/dl; median 108 mg/dl), but with moderately elevated hs-CRP levels (> 2 mg/l; median 4.25 mg/l). Rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol by 50% (to a median of 55 mg/dl) and hs-CRP by 37%. The trial, which should last 5 years, was stopped after a median follow-up of 1.9 years because of an imbalance in favour of the rosuvastatin group. Indeed, when compared to placebo, rosuvastatin was associated with a relative risk reduction in the composite primary end point of 44%, in myocardial infarction of 54%, in stroke of 48%, in revascularization procedures or hospitalisations for unstable angina of 47%, in major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke and death) of 47% and in deaths from any cause of 20%. Consistent effects were observed in all subgroups evaluated. The only adverse event was a higher incidence of physician-reported diabetes in the rosuvastatin group compared to the placebo group. This study demonstrates that rosuvastatin 20 mg reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events, including total mortality, in apparently healthy persons without hyperlipidaemia, but with elevated hs-CRP. However, the design of the trial does not allow discriminating which part of the favourable effect results from the drastic reduction in LDL cholesterol and which part results from the reduction in hs-CRP stricto sensu.", 
    "194": "The second part of this in-depth clinical review focuses on drugs used in the prevention of AKI in the patient at risk and/or in the management of the patient with incipient AKI. Among the drugs used to maintain a normal renal perfusion pressure, norepinephrine and vasopressin are most commonly used in hypotensive critically ill patients. The most recent RCT did not find a difference between low-dose vasopressin plus norepinephrine and norepinephrine alone in patients with septic shock, suggesting that either approach is reasonable. However, vasopressin may be beneficial in the less severe septic shock subgroup. Loop diuretics may convert an oliguric into a non-oliguric form of AKI that may allow easier fluid and/or nutritional support of the patient. Volume overload in AKI patients is common and diuretics may provide symptomatic benefit in that situation. However, loop diuretics are neither associated with improved survival, nor with better recovery of renal function in AKI. Among the renal vasodilating drugs, the routine administration of dopamine to patients for the prevention of AKI or incipient AKI is no longer justified. On the other hand, although additional studies may be warranted, fenoldopam may appear to be a likely candidate for the prevention of AKI, particularly in critically ill patients, if the positive results obtained in some recent studies are confirmed. Trials with natriuretic peptides were in general inconclusive but despite the fact that nesiritide is currently approved by the FDA only for the treatment of heart failure, this vasodilator may in the future play a role in the prevention of AKI, particularly in association with heart failure and cardiac surgery. The most recent trials seem to confirm a potential positive preventive effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC), particularly in contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), NAC alone should never take the place of IV hydration in patients at risk for CIN; fluids likely have a more substantiated benefit. At present, initiation of statin therapy for the prevention of CIN cannot be recommended, but these drugs should not be stopped before a radiological intervention in patients on chronic statin therapy. Rasburicase is very effective in the prevention of acute tumour lysis syndrome. Erythropoietin (EPO) has tissue-protective effects and prevents tissue damage during ischaemia and inflammation, and currently trials are performed with EPO in the prevention of AKI post-cardiac surgery, CIN and post-kidney transplantation. From this review it becomes clear that single-drug therapy will probably never be effective in the prevention of AKI and that multiple agents may be needed to improve outcomes. In addition, drugs should be administered early during the course of the disease."
