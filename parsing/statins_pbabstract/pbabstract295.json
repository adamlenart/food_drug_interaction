These changes may provide greater choice for individuals and offer potential savings in government spending on health while expanding the market for pharmaceutical companies. However, there is concern regarding the safety of these reclassifications. Elderly people are the largest consumers of prescription and OTC medicines and are more vulnerable to drug adverse effects and the risks of multiple or inappropriate medications. Commonly purchased agents such as NSAIDs have recognised adverse effects which have been shown to be more common in the elderly. Furthermore, all sedatives, including antihistamines, have a propensity to cause falls in older people. As many doctors do not ask patients about OTC medicine use, problems related to use of these drugs may go undetected. Furthermore, the increased availability of OTCs may result in a delay in patients consulting medical practitioners for potentially serious conditions, although this has not so far been investigated. In the UK, the recent switch of a low-dose HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) to OTC status has caused concern. Although there might theoretically be some benefits from improved access to medications used in primary and secondary prevention of heart disease, the actual outcomes of use of this reduced dose of the statin will be difficult or impossible for patients or practitioners to monitor. OTC drug use implies a mutual responsibility for communication between patients and health professionals that in practice is not always achieved. Epidemiological research is needed to investigate patterns of OTC use and evaluate the potential risks of OTC medicines in elderly people. Governments, regulatory bodies, professionals and the drug industry have a responsibility to ensure that robust systems are in place if the increased use of OTC medicines by elderly people is to be safe and effective.", 
    "1": "Simvastatin and cerivastatin have been used to investigate the development of statin-induced muscle necrosis in the rat. This was similar for both statins and was treatment-duration dependent, only occurring after 10 days had elapsed even if the dose was increased, and still occurring after this time when dosing was terminated earlier as a result of morbidity. It was then widespread and affected all areas of the muscular system. However, even when myotoxicity was severe, particular individual muscles and some types of fibres within affected muscles were spared consistently. Fibre typing of spared muscles and of acutely necrotic fibres within affected muscles indicated a differential fibre sensitivity to statin-induced muscle necrosis. The fibres showed a necrotic response to statin administration that matched their oxidative/glycolytic metabolic nature: Least sensitive --> I < - > IIA < - > IID < - > IIB <-- most sensitive. Type I and IIB fibres represent metabolic extremes of a continuum of metabolic properties through the fibre types with type I fibres most oxidative in metabolism and type IIB fibres most glycolytic. In addition, in some (nonnecrotic) glycolytic fibres from muscles showing early multifocal single fibre necrosis the only subcellular alterations present in isolation of any other changes were mitochondrial. These changes were characterised by an increased incidence of vacuolation and the formation of myelinoid vesicular bodies that accumulated in the subsarcolemmal areas. These findings suggest an important early involvement of mitochondria in selective glycolytic muscle fibre necrosis following inhibition of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "2": "Pravastatin is a well known 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor. Cumulative studies have shown that pravastatin is taken up into hepatocytes by the organic anion transporting polypeptide family transporters and excreted into the bile as an intact form by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2). It is generally accepted that the bile salt export pump (BSEP/ABCB11) mainly transports bile acids and plays an indispensable role in their biliary excretion. Interestingly, we found that BSEP could accept pravastatin as a substrate. Significant ATP-dependent uptake of pravastatin by human BSEP (hBSEP)- and rat BSEP (rBsep)-expressing membrane vesicles was observed, and the ratio of the uptake activity of pravastatin to that of taurocholic acid (TCA) by hBSEP was 3.3-fold higher than that by rBsep. The K(m) value of pravastatin for hBSEP was 124 muM. A mutual inhibition study between TCA and pravastatin revealed that they competitively interact with hBSEP. Several statins inhibited the hBSEP- and rBsep-mediated uptake of TCA; however, the specific uptake of other statins (cerivastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin) by hBSEP and rBSEP was not detected. The inhibitory effects of hydrophilic statins (pravastatin and rosuvastatin) on the uptake of TCA by BSEP were relatively lower than those of lipophilic statins. These data suggest that BSEP may be partly involved in the biliary excretion of pravastatin in both rats and humans.",

    "4": "Rosuvastatin, the latest statin to receive approved labeling by the Food and Drug Administration, has shown superior efficacy in lowering low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. At daily doses of 5-40 mg, rosuvastatin produces mean reductions in plasma LDL cholesterol of 45-63%, statistically greater than those achieved with equivalent doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. Rosuvastatin also improves triglyceride, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels to produce a more favorable lipid profile. Rosuvastatin's safety was studied in more than 10,000 patients, exceeding the number of patients evaluated before the launch of any other statin. Many of these patients took the drug for up to 96 weeks. With regard to muscle, renal, and hepatic toxicity and the withdrawal rate due to adverse events, rosuvastatin demonstrates a safety profile similar to that of the other marketed statins. Rosuvastatin undergoes only minor metabolism (10% of the administered dose) by the cytochrome P-450 2C9 isoenzyme. Significant drug interactions were reported with cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, warfarin, and antacids. Evidence suggests that rosuvastatin will be a valuable addition to the choices for treatment of patients with dyslipidemia.",

    "6": "The benefits of long-term statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) treatment for preventing coronary events have been well documented in several large-scale prospective clinical trials. By influencing the determinants of myocardial injury, statins may produce direct cardioprotective effects in the ischemic myocardium and prevent further damaging recurrent events. Although not proven fully in a clinical setting, cholesterol-independent or 'pleiotropic' effects of statins are thought to protect against myocardial injury and may occur via a number of mechanisms. Endothelial dysfunction occurs early in the development of atherosclerosis and is associated with a reduction in endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production. Statins have been shown to increase the expression of endothelial NO synthase, with subsequent augmentation of NO in the vasculature. Statins have also been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects, reducing the release of cytokines and chemokines, decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory cell adhesion molecules, and reducing the accumulation of neutrophils in myocardial tissue following ischemia and reperfusion. Indeed, the role of statins in reducing infarct size is supported by data from a number of preclinical studies. Statin treatment, administered at the onset of reperfusion, has been shown to reduce infarct size by approximately 50% following ischemia in various animal models, and this may be an NO-dependent effect. Randomized clinical trials have indicated that early initiation of statin treatment is associated with a reduction in both the rate of recurrence of cardiovascular events and death in patients with acute coronary syndrome. In addition, decreased rates of myocardial infarction and mortality were demonstrated in several retrospective studies where statin treatment was administered before an interventional procedure. There is a need for further clinical trials to fully elucidate the importance of pre-procedural statin therapy and to determine the extent and mechanisms by which statins exert their cardioprotective effects.",

    "12": "Atorvastatin is metabolized through enzymes encoded by members of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A gene family. Some patients who take atorvastatin along with concomitant medications known to inhibit CYP3A enzyme activity (e.g. itraconazole) develop rhabdomyolysis secondary to a severe drug-induced myopathy. The present study aimed to characterize the relationship between CYP3A gene polymorphisms and atorvastatin-induced muscle damage in the context of concomitant medication. The study employed a retrospective case--control (n=137) design. Study subjects were recruited from the general patient population served by Marshfield Clinic, a large horizontally integrated multispecialty group practice located in central Wisconsin, and case assignment was based upon both subjective (myalgia) and objective inclusion criteria [elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels]. The primary outcome was the relationship between serum CK level and CYP3A genotype. CYP3A genotype was not associated with an increased risk for the development of atorvastatin-induced muscle damage. CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*3 allele frequencies were similar in cases (n=68) and controls (n=69). Conversely, CYP3A genotype was associated with an increased severity of atorvastatin-induced muscle damage. An association was identified between the non-functional CYP3A5*3 allele and the magnitude of serum CK elevation in case patients experiencing myalgia. Patients who were homozygous for CYP3A5*3 demonstrated greater serum CK levels than patients who were heterozygous for CYP3A5*3, when concomitant lipid-lowering agents were sequentially removed from the analysis (P=0.025 without gemfibrozil, P=0.010 without gemfibrozil and niacin). The study demonstrates that patients who develop myalgia while taking atorvastatin are more likely to experience a greater degree of muscle damage if they express two copies of CYP3A5*3.", 
    "13": "Proteases that digest the blood-meal of the parasitic fluke Schistosoma are potential targets for therapy of schistosomiasis, a disease of chronic morbidity in humans. We generated a three-dimensional model of the cathepsin D target protease of Schistosoma japonicum (SjCD) utilizing the crystal structure of human cathepsin D (huCD) in complex with pepstatin as template. A homology model was also generated for the related secreted aspartic protease 2 (SAP2) of the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans . An initial panel of seven statin inhibitors, originally designed for huCD [Majer et al., Protein Sci. 6 (1997), pp. 1458-1466], was tested against the two pathogen proteases. One inhibitor showed poor reactivity with SjCD. Examination of the SjCD active-site cleft revealed that the poor inhibition was due to a unique steric barrier situated between the S2 and S4 subsites. An in silico screen of 20 potential statin scaffolds with the SjCD model and incorporating the steric barrier constraint was performed. Four inhibitors (SJ1-SJ4) were eventually synthesized and tested with SjCD, bovine CD and SAP2. Of these, SJ2 and SJ3 proved moderately more specific for SjCD over bovine CD, with IC 50 values of 15 and 60 nM, respectively. The unique steric barrier identified here provides a structural focus for further development of more specific SjCD inhibitors.",

Endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortic rings was measured by isometric tension recording, and DDAH activity, and the contents of nitrite/nitrate as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) in aortic tissue were determined after exposure of Sprague-Dawley rat aorta to AGE-BSA (1.70 mmol/L) for 60 minutes in the presence or absence of pravastatin. In comparison with control, both endothelium-dependent relaxation and DDAH activity (0.032 +/- 0.002 versus 0.095 +/- 0.003 U/g protein, n = 5, P < 0.01) were significantly inhibited in isolated rat aorta after exposure to AGE-BSA, which was accompanied by decreases of nitrite/nitrate contents and elevations of MDA levels in aorta. Treatment with pravastatin (1 mmol/L) not only prevented the inhibition of endothelial function but also reversed the decrease of DDAH activity induced by AGE-BSA and normalized the alterations in nitrite/nitrate and MDA contents. Similar effects were observed when rat aorta exposed to AGE-BSA in the presence of antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocharbamate (PDTC, 30 micromol/L) or protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine (1 micromol/L). These results suggested that decreased DDAH activity may be involved in endothelial dysfunction of rat aorta induced by AGE-BSA, and that pravastatin restores DDAH activity and endothelium-dependent relaxation after aorta exposure to AGE-BSA, which may be secondary to its antioxidative effects.", 
    "30": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (RSH/SLOS) is an autosomal recessive, malformation syndrome caused by mutations in the 3beta-hydroxysterol delta7-reductase gene (DHCR7). DHCR7 catalyzes the reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to cholesterol. We report the mutation analysis and determination of residual cholesterol synthesis in 47 SLOS patients, and the effects of treatment of SLOS skin fibroblasts with simvastatin. Using deuterium labeling we have quantified the amount of synthesized cholesterol and 7DHC in homozygote, heterozygote, and control fibroblast cell lines. In SLOS fibroblasts, the fraction of synthesized cholesterol to total sterol synthesis ranged from undetectable to over 50%. This establishes that different mutant alleles encode enzymes with varying degrees of residual activity. There was a correlation between increased phenotypic severity and decreased residual cholesterol synthesis (r(2)=0.45, p<0.0001). Simvastatin treatment of SLOS fibroblasts with residual DHCR7 enzymatic activity decreased 7DHC levels and increased cholesterol synthesis. This increase in cholesterol synthesis is due to increased expression of a mutant allele with residual function. Determination of residual enzymatic activity for specific DHCR7 mutant alleles will help in understanding the processes underlying the broad phenotypic spectrum found in this disorder and will be useful in identifying patients who may benefit from simvastatin therapy.",

By the same token, substrate reduction is an emerging therapeutic strategy for the arcane field of the lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). Reduced biosynthesis of glucosylceramide is postulated to allow correction of the imbalance between formation and breakdown of glycosphingolipids; the therapeutic effect of substrate reduction depends upon the presence of residual hydrolytic activity towards those accumulated glycosphingolipid substrates derived from glucosylceramide. First pioneered in the laboratory by Norman Radin, this approach has now been introduced into the clinic: based on the ability to inhibit uridine diphosphate glucosylceramide transferase, the semi-selective iminosugar, N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, is licensed for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease.",

Our study population comprised 946 subjects aged at least 70 years in whom both CRP and ankle brachial index were measured. The participants were classified into a low (ankle brachial index<0.9) and normal ankle brachial index group. We found that current smoking, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dl, a low body mass index (continuous variable), hypertension, diabetes and statin use were all significantly related to a lower ankle brachial index. Higher log-transformed CRP level was significantly related to a lower ankle brachial index after adjustment for the cardiovascular risk factors mentioned above (p <0.01). The odds ratios for low ankle brachial index compared to 0-1 risk factors were 5.79 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.99-11.20) for 2 risk factors and 17.45 (95% CI: 6.78-49.91) for 3 or more risk factors; independently of other risk factors, the odds ratio for CRP>1.0 mg/l was 2.10 (95% CI: 1.13-3.88) compared to lower CRP values. Thus, a high level of CRP is related to a low ankle brachial index among Japanese elderly as well as Western subjects.

Only 11% allocated pravastatin and 44% allocated atorvastatin achieved the goals of LDL-C <70 mg/dl and CRP <2 mg/l, and only 5.8% allocated pravastatin 40 mg and 26.1% allocated atorvastatin 80 mg reached the even lower goals of LDL-C <70 mg/dl and CRP <1 mg/l. The correlation coefficient for CRP measured at 30 days and at end of study was 0.61 (p < 0.001), a value almost identical to that for LDL-C over the same follow-up period (r = 0.62, p < 0.001).",

Debates regarding areas of research and treatment designs have made headlines as scientists in the field question ongoing work. Despite these academic quarrels, significant insights concerning the cellular and molecular basis of AD have illuminated the potential causes and consequences of AD pathogenesis in the human brain. Additionally, assigning relationships among scientific evidence is difficult due to the nature of the disease. It is crucial to note that all findings do not constitute causality as AD has many stages of progression, and therefore a particular finding may reflect disease epiphenomenon. Determining the primary causes of disease are even more problematic when considering that a succinct timeline in which a normal aging brain develops AD-like changes due to a single cause may not be appropriate, as increasing lines of evidence indicate that multiple factors likely contribute to the clinical manifestation of AD. Implications for therapeutic strategies are dramatically affected by viewing AD as a multi-factorial disease state, one specific treatment may not be able to prevent or reverse AD if this is indeed the case. In this regard, the current focus on individual therapeutic targets may prove to be ineffective in the successful treatment of AD; however, if taken in combination, these singular therapies may likely result in the global suppression of AD. In this review, the scientific basis for common AD therapeutics as well as the efficacy of these treatments will be discussed.", 
    "58": "According to the current evidence, the fastest growing proportion of patient populations seeking healthcare is those over 65 years of age. Coronary artery disease and subclinical atherosclerosis are highly prevalent in this group of patients and are strongly linked to dyslipidemia, a well-established risk factor for atherosclerosis. Treating dyslipidemia in this group of patients requires specific knowledge and understanding of common dyslipidemias and the relative safety of various pharmacologic agents in the presence of possible multiple comorbidities. Lifestyle modification remains the first step in the treatment of dyslipidemia; however, it can be difficult to sustain and achieve acceptable compliance in the elderly and it is best used in combination with drug therapy. Statins are widely accepted as the first-line therapy. Several recent studies have demonstrated that statins are safe and effective in the elderly. However, it is important to note that there is very limited data regarding the effects of dyslipidemia treatment on morbidity and mortality in patients over 85 years of age. In summary, the clinicians must recognize that the presence of dyslipidemia in the elderly poses substantial risk of coronary events and stroke. The available evidence has demonstrated that in most elderly patients who are at increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, treatment of dyslipidemia with appropriate therapy reduces the risk, and when used carefully with close monitoring for safety, the treatment is generally well tolerated. With increasing life expectancy, it is critical for physicians to recognize the importance of detection and treatment of dyslipidemia in the elderly.",

    "80": "Patients with type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome have an elevated risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Until recently, strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients focused mainly on controlling glycemia and blood pressure as a means of preventing disease progression. However, the metabolic abnormalities that cluster both in patients with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome are all independent risk factors for atherogenesis. There is now substantial evidence that dyslipidemia is an important, modifiable risk factor for CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Recent sub-group analyses of landmark statin trials, such as the Heart Protection Study (HPS), confirm that the benefits of intensive statin therapy on CVD risk extend to patients with type 2 diabetes, irrespective of baseline lipid levels. In addition, the Collaborative AtoRvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the first statin study to focus solely on patients with type 2 diabetes, was stopped early due to the overwhelming benefits of statin therapy on cardiovascular risk in a study population who previously would not have been considered dyslipidemic (mean baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], 3.0 mmol/l [116 mg/dl]). As a result, treatment guidelines are setting increasingly stringent goals for LDL-C levels in an attempt to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, with physicians estimating that approximately 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes do not achieve these goals, initiation of appropriate, effective and rapid-acting statin therapy is paramount in these high-risk patients.", 
    "81": "The pleiotropic effects of statins continue to garner attention. One area of interest that requires more attention is their potential, or that of another heart healthy agent, to impact favorably or inhibit the progression of numerous cancers, especially prostate cancer. Statins have accumulated a plethora of data in the area of general cancer cell line inhibition, and the potential to have a synergistic impact in patients receiving a variety of conventional treatments for a diversity of cancers is endorsed at least by laboratory and some preliminary small clinical studies. However, prostate cancer is unique compared to other cancers because, despite a high prevalence, some men choose watchful waiting or no treatment, especially if they are older and/or have a well-differentiated tumor. Thus, prostate cancer is a good candidate for the potential investigation of statins after diagnosis, with or without standard therapy. Regardless, because the number 1 or 2 cause of death in men with prostate cancer is cardiovascular disease than even in the worst-case scenario, these agents appear attractive for more immediate clinical study because they could impact a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these men. It is time to see the forest over the tree, and statins seem to have an argument as good as many other agents for allocating more money and time to test their ability as adjuvant therapy in a randomized trial or, in some cases, of nonaggressive disease as a potential monotherapy.",

    "110": "Dyslipidemia and progression of cardiovascular calcification (CVC) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Cardiovascular calcification (CVC) is commonly encountered both in the general population as well as in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The etiology of CVC in patients with ESRD is multifactorial. Despite that, current debate remains narrowly focused on the role of calcium loading from calcium-based phosphate binders (CBPB) in the pathogenesis and progression of CVC. Yet, the alleged link between these binders and CVC has not been substantiated in well-designed controlled trials. In contrast, the purported role of sevelamer, a non-calcium-based phosphate binder, in slowing the progression of CVC in dialysis patients has attracted widespread attention. The beneficial effect of sevelamer on progression of calcification was thought to be due to lower calcium loading during its use. However, an alternative and possibly more likely mechanism involves sevelamer-induced lowering of LDL cholesterol. In this context, previous studies in individuals with normal renal function have documented amelioration of coronary artery calcification (CAC) with reduction of LDL-cholesterol by treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Given that CAC is a well-accepted marker of atherosclerosis, and that high plasma cholesterol concentration is one of the main risk factors for atherosclerosis, then it is not unreasonable to suspect that CAC may be halted or even reversed by lowering of LDL cholesterol level with statin therapy. Unfortunately, the effect of lowering the LDL-cholesterol level on CAC has not been studied in patients with ESRD. Therefore, conclusions about this important topic should await the results of well-designed clinical studies that control for all factors potentially implicated in the CVC burden of patients with ESRD. In this review, I will discuss the role of various potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CVC in patients with ESRD, and emphasize the role of dyslipidemia and its treatment in this important clinical entity.", 
    "111": "Transient myocardial ischaemia in the absence of chest pain ('silent ischaemia') commonly occurs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and has important prognostic implications. However, doubts exist as to whether and how silent ischaemia should be managed. In the present article we review current knowledge regarding silent ischaemia and the role of recently developed drugs that may be effective to control its occurrence. Since the description in the 1770s of the syndrome of 'angina pectoris' by William Heberden, the importance of chest pain for the diagnosis of CAD has remained un-abated. However, several decades ago it became apparent that both myocardial infarctions and transient episodes of myocardial ischaemia could occur in the absence of chest pain. Indeed, a large proportion of patients with CAD have both silent and painful myocardial ischaemia as a manifestation of CAD. Whether the presence of asymptomatic ischaemic electrocardiographic changes in patients with CAD has prognostic importance and whether it needs medical or surgical treatment has been a matter of speculation for several decades.",

    "128": "We investigated the effect of fluvastatin (Flv), an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger 1 (NCX1) expression in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed that Flv decreased NCX1 mRNA in a concentration- and time-dependent manner and NCX1 protein. This effect of Flv was caused by the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, because Flv did not affect the NCX1 mRNA in the presence of mevalonate. Flv-induced down-regulation of NCX1 mRNA was also cancelled by farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), suggesting an involvement of small G-proteins. However, overexpression of neither constitutive active RhoA nor Ras affected NCX1 mRNA. In contrast, intracellular expression of C3 toxin, a specific inhibitor of Rho family proteins, decreased NCX1 mRNA, suggesting that Flv decreases NCX1 mRNA by inhibiting a signaling pathway of Rho family proteins other than RhoA. On the other hand, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), an activator of Rho signaling, increased both NCX1 mRNA and protein in a C3 toxin-sensitive manner. Western blot analyses revealed that membrane-associated RhoB, which is isoprenylated by either FPP or GGPP, was decreased by Flv but was increased by LPC. Selective inhibition of gene expression by short interfering RNA duplex showed that RhoB but not RhoA is involved in the regulation of NCX1 mRNA and protein. When transcription was blocked by 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, the NCX1 mRNA stability was decreased by Flv. Long-term treatment of rat with Flv in vivo also down-regulated the cardiac NCX1 mRNA. These results suggest that a RhoB-mediated signaling pathway regulates cardiac NCX1 levels by controlling the NCX1 mRNA stability.",

These epidemiological and clinical observations suggest that determination of plasma CRP concentrations could be used as an adjunct for risk assessment in primary and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease and be of prognostic value. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence for CRP as an independent predictor of cerebrovascular events in at-risk individuals and ischemic stroke patients and to consider its usefulness in evaluating prognosis after stroke.",

    "143": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, statins, have been shown to positively impact vascular function independent of their plasma lipid-lowering action. Several of these beneficial effects involve modulation of gene expression. Here we explored whether the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), a biomechanically activated gene we recently identified as part of the endothelial \"atheroprotective phenotype,\" is regulated by statins and whether this mechanism is important for the non-lipid lowering beneficial effects mediated by these drugs in endothelium. The mRNA levels of KLF2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells increased in the presence of various statins. KLF2 induction was observed within 8 h after drug treatment and remained elevated for at least 24 h. This statin effect on KLF2 expression was reversed by addition of mevalonate and its downstream metabolite geranygeranyl pyrophosphate. Furthermore, inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation with GGTI-298 significantly induced KLF2 levels, whereas inhibition of farnesylation did not. Statin-mediated KLF2 expression was followed by the up-regulation of several of its downstream transcriptional targets. Using small interfering RNA to block KLF2 expression, we demonstrated that this transcription factor is necessary for the statin-mediated regulation of several pathophysiologically relevant genes. These results strongly implicate KLF2 as a transcriptional regulator of the statin-mediated effects in vascular endothelium and provide a novel mechanism for the well established non-lipid lowering beneficial cardiovascular effects of statins.",

Twenty-one patients ( 4 men and 17 women) with type IIa and IIb hyperlipidemia were randomized to 3 drugs (pravastatin 20 mg/d, atorvastatin 10 mg/d, fenofibrate 250 mg/d) for 8 weeks.

There was no significant difference in body mass index, lipid profile, fibrinogen level, and erythrocyte deformability index values among the groups before treatment ( P > .05). In all groups, there were statistically significant reductions in total LDL-C levels ( P < .05).

As traditional risk factors cannot alone explain the unacceptable high prevalence and incidence of CVD in this population, inflammation (which is interrelated to insulin resistance, oxidative stress, wasting and endothelial dysfunction) has been suggested to be a significant contributor. Indeed, several different inflammatory biomarkers, such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), have been shown to independently predict mortality in ESRD patients. As CRP is so strongly associated with vascular disease it has been suggested that this hepatic-derived protein is not only a marker, but also a mediator of vascular disease. Indeed, recent in vitro data from studies on endothelial cells, monocytes-macrophages and smooth muscle cells support a direct role for CRP in atherogenesis. The causes of the highly prevalent state of inflammation in ESRD are multiple, including decreased renal function, volume overload, comorbidity and intercurrent clinical events, factors associated with the dialysis procedure and genetic factors. Recent evidence suggests that several cytokine DNA polymorphisms may affect the inflammatory state as well as outcome in ESRD patients. As interventions directed towards traditional risk factors have, so far, not proven to be very effective, controlled studies are needed to evaluate if various pharmacological as well as non-pharmacological anti-inflammatory treatment strategies, alone or in combination, may be an option to affect the unacceptable high cardiovascular mortality rate in this patient group.",

    "165": "Proper accomplishment of all of these steps should result in adoption of efficacious, safe, and cost-effective therapies.", 
    "166": "Ezetimibe is the first lipid-lowering drug that inhibits intestinal uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol without affecting the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised (>80%) to the pharmacologically active ezetimibe-glucuronide. Total ezetimibe (sum of 'parent' ezetimibe plus ezetimibe-glucuronide) concentrations reach a maximum 1-2 hours post-administration, followed by enterohepatic recycling and slow elimination. The estimated terminal half-life of ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide is approximately 22 hours. Consistent with the elimination half-life of ezetimibe, an approximate 2-fold accumulation is observed upon repeated once-daily administration. The recommended dose of ezetimibe 10 mg/day can be administered in the morning or evening without regard to food. There are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on ezetimibe pharmacokinetics and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment or mild-to-severe renal insufficiency. The major metabolic pathway for ezetimibe consists of glucuronidation of the 4-hydroxyphenyl group by uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes to form ezetimibe-glucuronide in the intestine and liver. Approximately 78% of the dose is excreted in the faeces predominantly as ezetimibe, with the balance found in the urine mainly as ezetimibe-glucuronide. Overall, ezetimibe has a favourable drug-drug interaction profile, as evidenced by the lack of clinically relevant interactions between ezetimibe and a variety of drugs commonly used in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Ezetimibe does not have significant effects on plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors commonly known as statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate), digoxin, glipizide, warfarin and triphasic oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel). Concomitant administration of food, antacids, cimetidine or statins had no significant effect on ezetimibe bioavailability. Although coadministration with gemfibrozil and fenofibrate increased the bioavailability of ezetimibe, the clinical significance is thought to be minor considering the relatively flat dose-response curve of ezetimibe and the lack of dose-related increase in adverse events. In contrast, coadministration with the bile acid binding agent colestyramine significantly decreased ezetimibe oral bioavailability (based on area under the plasma concentration-time curve of total ezetimibe). Hence, ezetimibe and colestyramine should be administered several hours apart to avoid attenuating the efficacy of ezetimibe. Finally, higher ezetimibe exposures were observed in patients receiving concomitant ciclosporin, and ezetimibe caused a small but statistically significant effect on plasma levels of ciclosporin. Because treatment experience in patients receiving ciclosporin is limited, physicians are advised to exercise caution when initiating ezetimibe in the setting of ciclosporin coadministration, and to carefully monitor ciclosporin levels.", 
    "167": "The effects of statins on bone formation in periprosthetic osteolysis have not been determined to date. We investigated the effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin on osteoblastic bone formation under conditions of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) particle-induced osteolysis. The murine calvarial osteolysis model was utilized in 21 C57BL/J6 mice randomized to three groups. Group I underwent sham surgery only, group II received UHMWPE particles, and group III, particles and simvastatin treatment. After 2 weeks, calvaria were processed for histomorphometry and stained with Giemsa dye. New bone formation was measured as osteoid tissue area within the midline suture. Bone thickness was quantified as indicator of net bone growth. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and a Student's t-test. New bone formation and bone thickness were significantly enhanced following simvastatin treatment. New bone formation was 0.008+/-0.008 mm2 in sham controls (group I), 0.015+/-0.012 mm2 after particle implantation without further intervention (group II), compared to 0.083+/-0.021 mm2 with particle implantation and simvastatin treatment (group III) (p=0.003). The bone thickness was 0.213+/-0.007 mm in group I, 0.183+/-0.005 mm in group II, and 0.238+/-0.009 mm in group III (p=0.00008). In conclusion, simvastatin treatment markedly promoted bone formation and net bone growth in UHMWPE particle-induced osteolysis in a murine calvarial model. These new findings indicate that simvastatin may have favorable osteoanabolic effects on wear debris-mediated osteolysis after total joint arthroplasty, involving local stimulation of osteoblastic bone formation.", 
    "168": "The total synthesis of (+)-dihydrocompactin via an intramolecular ionic Diels-Alder reaction that proceeds with remote stereocontrol is described. This reaction proceeds by an intermediate vinyl-oxocarbenium ion (6), the conformational constraints of which lead to the observed asymmetric induction. The sense of asymmetric induction appears contrasteric and is explained by the proposed reactive conformation shown in Figure 1.", 
    "169": "In the United States, large and growing minority populations, including African Americans, Hispanic Americans and South Asians, are highly susceptible to the development of cardiovascular disease. Compared with Americans of other ancestries, these populations exhibit a higher prevalence of a number of risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity and diabetes mellitus. The clustering of risk factors in these groups is also greater than in white populations. Despite the considerable burden imposed by cardiovascular disease, African Americans, Hispanic Americans and South Asians remain inadequately targeted for risk-reduction strategies, including screening and treatment for dyslipidemia. In addition, these groups have traditionally been underrepresented in trials of lipid-modifying therapy. Large, ongoing epidemiologic and clinical trials will add to our knowledge of cardiovascular risk in these minority populations and contribute to recommendations to improve risk management.", 
    "170": "Some medications have been shown to produce reductions in hs-CRP levels after initiating therapy. Whereas the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the inflammatory process has been documented in more detail during the last few years, the impact of an ACE-inhibitor therapy on this process has not been fully understood so far. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a therapy with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor ramipril on hs-CRP plasma concentrations in patients with atherosclerosis.", 
    "171": "A total of 24 patients were enrolled in this prospective, uncontrolled, open-label multicenter study. Inclusion criteria were documented atherosclerosis, baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein between 3 and 12 mg/l, LDL-Cholesterol < or =150 mg/dl and no previous treatment with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Ten patients, pretreated with statins, and 10 patients not previously treated with statins were eligible for statistical analysis. Baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was significantly decreased from 3.99+/-1.61 mg/l (mean+/-SD) to 2.72+/-1.19 mg/l (-32%) after 3 months treatment with 10 mg ramipril daily (p=0.0002). The decrease was more pronounced in patients who had not been treated with statins previously (-1.50 mg/l+/-1.44 mg/l) compared to those who were pretreated (-0.90 mg/l+/-0.93 mg/l).", 
    "172": "The ACE inhibitor ramipril administered in a daily dose of 10 mg to patients with atherosclerosis reduces the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration. This effect may contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction mediated by ramipril aside from the blood pressure lowering effect.", 
    "173": "Colesevelam is the newest bile resin with a unique chemical structure. It binds to bile acids with higher affinity than traditional bile acid sequestrants and has fewer gastrointestinal side effects and drug interactions. Colesevelam is safe and efficacious alone or in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Despite this, the role of colesevelam in the treatment of hyperlipidemia remains limited, particularly in the face of new lipid lowering agents. As guidelines for cholesterol control become more stringent, the need to maximize therapeutic benefit through combination therapy will become increasingly more important. Colesevelam has a dose-sparing effect on statin therapy, potentially decreasing the risk of unwanted side effects or drug-drug interactions associated with statin use. This makes colesevelam a viable option for addition to a statin regimen when goal LDL-C levels cannot be achieved with a statin alone. Additionally, anecdotal reports indicate that colesevelam may have potential benefits in certain patient populations that cannot tolerate other lipid lowering therapies, including organ transplant recipients, cholestatic liver disesase, and end-stage renal disease. By recognizing the potential utility of colesevelam, clinicians can better manage those patients who are not able to tolerate first-line therapies.", 
    "174": "Statins may exert important pleiotropic effects, ie, improve endothelial function, independently of their impact on LDL cholesterol. In humans, however, pleiotropic effects of statins have never been unequivocally demonstrated because prolonged statin treatment always results in reduced LDL cholesterol levels. We therefore tested the hypothesis that similar reductions in LDL cholesterol with simvastatin and ezetimibe, a novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor, result in different effects on endothelial function.", 
    "175": "Twenty patients with chronic heart failure were randomized to 4 weeks of simvastatin (10 mg/d) or ezetimibe (10 mg/d) treatment. Flow-dependent dilation (FDD) of the radial artery was determined by high-resolution ultrasound before and after intra-arterial vitamin C to determine the portion of FDD inhibited by radicals (DeltaFDD-VC). Activity of extracellular superoxide dismutase, a major vascular antioxidant enzyme system, was determined after release from the endothelium by a heparin bolus injection. Endothelial progenitor cells were analyzed with an in vitro assay. Simvastatin and ezetimibe treatment reduced LDL cholesterol to a similar extent (15.6% versus 15.4%; P=NS), whereas changes in mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA-reductase, differed between groups (Deltamevalonate-simvastatin, -1.04+/-0.62 versus Deltamevalonate-ezetimibe, 1.79+/-0.94 ng/mL; P<0.05 between groups). Importantly, FDD was markedly improved after simvastatin (10.5+/-0.6% versus 5.1+/-0.7%; P<0.01) but not after ezetimibe treatment (5.6+/-0.5% versus 5.8+/-0.6%; P=NS). DeltaFDD-VC was substantially reduced after simvastatin but not after ezetimibe treatment. Extracellular superoxide dismutase activity was increased by >100% (P<0.05) after simvastatin but not ezetimibe treatment. Simvastatin treatment increased the number of functionally active endothelial progenitor cells, whereas ezetimibe had no effect.", 
    "176": "Four weeks of simvastatin treatment improves endothelial function independently of LDL cholesterol lowering, at least in part by reducing oxidant stress. Simvastatin may thereby exert important pleiotropic effects in humans.", 
    "177": "Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia induce endothelial dysfunction and inflammation through oxidative stress. Statins and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, improving endothelial function.", 
    "178": "Twenty type 2 diabetic patients ate 3 different test meals: a high-fat meal, 75 g glucose alone, and a high-fat meal plus glucose. Glycemia, triglyceridemia, endothelial function, nitrotyrosine, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and interleukin-6 were assayed during the tests. Subsequently, diabetics took atorvastatin 40 mg/d, irbesartan 300 mg/d, both, or placebo for 1 week. The 3 tests were performed again between 5 and 7 days after the start of each treatment. High-fat load and glucose alone produced a decrease in endothelial function and increases in nitrotyrosine, C-reactive protein, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and interleukin-6. These effects were more pronounced when high-fat load and glucose were combined. Short-term atorvastatin and irbesartan treatments significantly counterbalanced these phenomena, and their combination was more effective than either therapy alone.", 
    "179": "This study confirms an independent and cumulative effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia on endothelial function and inflammation, suggesting oxidative stress as a common mediator of such an effect. Short-term treatment with atorvastatin and irbesartan may counterbalance this phenomenon; the combination of the 2 compounds is most effective.", 
    "180": "Recent data suggest that statins used in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia decrease fracture risk. In this study, we aimed to investigate prospectively whether statins have an additive effect to bisphosphonates (risedronate) according to the primary hypothesis that the addition of atorvastatin to risedronate would produce an increase, from baseline, in lumbar vertebrae and total hip BMD that was greater than that observed with risedronate alone.", 
    "181": "A total of 120 hypercholesterolaemic postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or osteopenia were randomized to receive risedronate (5 mg/day) or risedronate (5 mg/day) plus atorvastatin (20 mg/day). Changes in bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and hip, and serum lipid and glucose metabolism changes were assessed.", 
    "182": "Compared with risedronate alone, at 6 months, risedronate plus atorvastatin produced significantly greater increases in the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (1.58% versus 0.75%, p < 0.05). We found no difference after therapy in BMD of the total hip (1.2% versus 1.1%). Risedronate plus atorvastatin therapy had favorable effects on the serum lipid profile: LDL and total cholesterol. Serum fasting glucose and HbA1c levels were not affected during the treatments.", 
    "183": "Statins have modest additive effects to bisphosphonates in improving lumbar spine bone mineral density in hypercholesterolaemic postmenopausal women with established osteoporosis-osteopenia. A long-term study with adequate sample size is necessary to assess the effects of statins -- in combination or alone -- on the bones and prevention of fractures.", 
    "184": "Alterations in lipid metabolism play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and are an important risk factor for cardiovascular events. Lowering of LDL cholesterol by statins reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), both in primary and secondary prevention. The results of large controlled trials that included more than 50,000 patients are the basis for target values promoted by current guidelines. According to the NCEP-ATP III guidelines LDL cholesterol should be lowered to less than 100 mg/dl in high risk patients (CAD or CAD equivalent) and in very high risk patients optional to less than 70 mg/dl. Up to now even in high risk patients the recommended goals are not sufficiently achieved: Up to 80% of high risk patients do not receive a statin and only a minority of those being treated with a statin have a LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dl. Furthermore, after a major event (e.g. myocardial infarction) the quality of lipid reduction decreases over time. Further efforts are required to improve this situation as a guide-line oriented approach may help to prevent up to 100,000 myocardial infarctions and deaths alone in high risk patients in Germany.", 
    "185": "Restenosis after coronary stenting is mainly caused by intimal hyperplasia. Both experimental and clinical studies suggest that statins may be able to inhibit intimal hyperplasia and, therefore, in-stent restenosis (ISR), by mechanisms beyond lipid lowering.",

However, persistent plaque decreased with simvastatin but increased in controls (-4.0 +/- 4.0 vs +1.6 +/- 3.8 mm3/mm, -14% +/- 10% vs +6% +/- 12%, P < .05). The same behavior was shown by intermediate plaques at nonstented sites (-2.5 +/- 3.0 vs +1.0 +/- 3.0 mm3/mm, -10% +/- 8% vs +9% +/- 9%, P < .05).

Ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/40 and 10/80 mg also provided significantly greater high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increases than atorvastatin 40 and 80 mg. Triglyceride reductions were similar for all comparisons. More ezetimibe/simvastatin than atorvastatin patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents attained the ATP III LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL and the optional LDL-C target of <70 mg/dL. C-reactive protein reductions were similar between treatment groups. Consecutive elevations in alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase occurred in significantly more atorvastatin patients than ezetimibe/simvastatin patients. No myopathy or liver-related adverse events led to study discontinuation with either drug.",
