    "1": "We analyzed data from a patient registry (606 patients) and conducted a systematic review.", 
    "2": "We identified 11 previous studies (6,438 patients) that evaluated the effect of statin use on outcomes after IV thrombolysis (8 studies), IA thrombolysis (2 studies), or a single/combined approach (1 study). In our registry and in most of the retrieved studies, statin users had more risk factors and concomitant antiplatelet treatment than nonstatin users. Regardless of treatment strategy, prior statin use was not associated with favorable outcome (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.36; 95 confidence interval [CI] 0.86-2.16), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.22-1.49), or recanalization (OR 1.87; 95% CI 0.69-5.03). In meta-analysis, prior statin use was not associated with favorable outcome (crude OR 0.99; 95% CI 0.88-1.12), but was associated with an increased risk of sICH (crude OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.23-1.95). However, when the available multivariable associations were combined (5 studies), the effect of prior statin use on risk of sICH was not significant (OR 1.31; 95% CI 0.97-1.76).", 
    "3": "These results suggest no beneficial or detrimental effect of prior statin use in acute stroke patients treated by IV thrombolysis, IA thrombolysis, or combined therapy, although the numbers of patients treated by IA thrombolysis or combined therapy are too small to exclude an effect.", 
    "4": "We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of atorvastatin (2, 5, and 10 mg/kg) on experimentally induced intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in adult rats; controls were administered PBS. Plasma TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 levels before and after ICH were analyzed at various time points by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neurological behavior of rats was assessed by climbing scores. At 3-days postoperatively, brain water contents and TNF-\u03b1/IL-10 expression in brain tissue were determined. Histopathological changes and microglial cells in the brain tissue were evaluated by light-microscopy. Post-ICH neurological deficits differed significantly between sham-operated group A and experimental-ICH group B (P < 0.05). Brain water contents were significantly less in group A than in group B (P < 0.05). Significant differences (P < 0.05) between two groups were observed regarding activated microglia, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 levels. Compared with group B, neurological deficits, brain water contents, pathological changes, and activated microglia were reduced (P < 0.05) in groups C (Experimental-ICH + atorvastatin 2 mg/kg), D (Experimental-ICH + atorvastatin 5 mg/kg) and E (Experimental-ICH + atorvastatin 10 mg/kg). Atorvastatin-induced a dose-dependent reduction of TNF-\u03b1 and increase of IL-10 levels (P < 0.05). Therefore, it was concluded that atorvastatin improved neurofunctional rehabilitation in rats through the suppression of cytokines-mediated inflammatory response and attenuation of brain damage following intracerebral hemorrhage.", 
    "5": "Novel drug delivery systems capable of continuous sustained release of therapeutics have been studied extensively for use in the prevention and management of chronic diseases. The use of these systems holds promise as a means to achieve higher patient compliance while improving therapeutic index and reducing systemic toxicity. In this work, an implantable nanochannel drug delivery system (nDS) is characterized and evaluated for the long-term sustained release of atorvastatin (ATS) and trans-resveratrol (t-RES), compounds with a proven role in managing atherogenic dyslipidemia and promoting cardioprotection. The primary mediators of drug release in the nDS are nanofluidic membranes with hundreds of thousands of nanochannels (up to 100,000/mm(2)) that attain zero-order release kinetics by exploiting nanoconfinement and molecule-to-surface interactions that dominate diffusive transport at the nanoscale. These membranes were characterized using gas flow analysis, acetone diffusion, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM, TEM). The surface properties of the dielectric materials lining the nanochannels, SiO(2) and low-stress silicon nitride, were further investigated using surface charge analysis. Continuous, sustained in vitro release for both ATS and t-RES was established for durations exceeding 1 month. Finally, the influence of the membranes on cell viability was assessed using human microvascular endothelial cells. Morphology changes and adhesion to the surface were analyzed using SEM, while an MTT proliferation assay was used to determine the cell viability. The nanochannel delivery approach, here demonstrated in vitro, not only possesses all requirements for large-scale high-yield industrial fabrication, but also presents the key components for a rapid clinical translation as an implantable delivery system for the sustained administration of cardioprotectants.",

Also, we aimed to observe the effect of statins on reducing level of ox-LDL and oxidation ratio of LDL, and explore whether statins still have similar effect on ox-LDL in a short period of therapy (within 2 weeks).", 
    "7": "Blood ox-LDL, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG were measured in cases with acute myocardial infarction (AMI, n=177), unstable angina pectoris (UAP, n=195), stable angina pectoris (SAP, n=228), normal control (n=120), and high risk control (n=140).", 
    "8": "Mean value of ox-LDL and oxidation ratio of LDL was significantly higher in the CAD group than in the two control groups. The AUC of ROC curve of ox-LDL, ox-LDL/TC, ox-LDL/HDL-C, ox-LDL/LDL-C and apoA1/apoB were more than 0.50 (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age and ox-LDL/LDL-C related with short-term, while ox-LDL/LDL-C and ox-LDL/TC related with long-term prognosis (p < 0.05). Furthermore, after treatment with statins for 2 weeks, TC, LDL-C, ox-LDL, ox-LDL/TC, ox-LDL/HDL-C and ox-LDL/LDL-C decreased by 22%, 28%, 38%, 29%, 23% and 25% respectively. And the reduction of ox-LDL by statins is independent of lowering of LDL-C and TC.", 
    "9": "Ox-LDL and oxidation ratio of LDL are closely related with AS, and they are better biomarkers for discriminating between patients with coronary artery disease and healthy subjects. In addition, statins can decrease level of ox-LDL significantly, which is independent of lowering of LDL-C and TC.",

The mean age is 68.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8 years, 64% were men, 41 (66%) were on statins at the time of CAS, and 27 (43.5%) had neurological symptoms pre-procedurally. The mean intra-procedural stenosis was similar between groups (statin: 89.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4% vs. no statin: 88.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9%, P = NS). There was no significant difference in overall pre-operative symptoms between the two groups. Statin users were more likely to have coronary artery disease (CAD, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), hyperlipidemia (HL, P\u00a0=\u00a00.047), or have undergone coronary artery bypass (CABG, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Statin use was associated with significantly less embolic particles (statin: 16.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 vs. no statin: 42.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.5, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) during CAS. Further, multivariate analysis controlling for CAD, HL, and CABG confirmed that statin use was independently associated with less captured debris (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). There was no significant difference in the mean particle size (statin: 326.2 \u03bcm \u00b1 31.1 vs. no statin 310.5 \u03bcm \u00b1 41.8), peri-procedural stroke, and MAE between the two groups (P = NS).",

    "19": "Analgesic activity of simvastatin and atorvastatin was assessed in tail flick model in rats (n = 6), where it was compared with aspirin and tramadol and in acetic acid induced writhing in mice (n = 6), where it was compared with aspirin. Anti-inflammatory activity of statins was evaluated using carrageenin induced paw edema and formalin induced arthritis in rats.", 
    "20": "In the tail flick method, analgesic effect of tramadol was significantly more than the other drugs except at two observation times, when it was comparable to simvastatin and atorvastatin. Effect of simvastatin was found to be comparable to aspirin. In acetic acid induced writhing method, analgesic activity of simvastatin was comparable to that of aspirin while that of atorvastatin was significantly less. In carrageenin induced paw edema in rats, both simvastatin and atorvastatin showed anti-inflammatory activity which was comparable to aspirin. Both the statins exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity (P < 0.01) in formalin induced arthritis model though less than aspirin (P < 0.05).", 
    "21": "The results of this study if substantiated by further experimental and clinical research suggest that simvastatin and atorvastatin may play an adjuvant role, which may be particularly beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, especially when there is coexisting dyslipidemia.", 
    "22": "The majority of cholesterol reduction therapies, such as the statin drugs, work primarily by inducing the expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs), rendering these therapeutics only partially effective in animals lacking LDLRs. Although thyroid hormones and their synthetic derivatives, often referred to as thyromimetics, have been clearly shown to reduce serum cholesterol levels, this action has generally been attributed to their ability to increase expression of hepatic LDLRs. Here we show for the first time that the thyroid hormone T(3) and the thyroid hormone receptor-\u03b2 selective agonists GC-1 and KB2115 are capable of markedly reducing serum cholesterol in mice devoid of functional LDLRs by inducing Cyp7a1 expression and stimulating the conversion and excretion of cholesterol as bile acids. Based on this LDLR-independent mechanism, thyromimetics such as GC-1 and KB2115 may represent promising cholesterol-lowering therapeutics for the treatment of diseases such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a rare genetic disorder caused by a complete lack of functional LDLRs, for which there are limited treatment options because most therapeutics are only minimally effective.", 
    "23": "It remains controversial as to whether simvastatin has a beneficial effect on pulmonary artery hypertension. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of simvastatin on haemodynamic changes, pulmonary vascular remodelling and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -9 (MMP-1,9) in a carotid artery-jugular vein (CA-JV) shunt pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) model in rats.", 
    "24": "Thirty-six Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: Control group, CA-JV group, and Treatment group. A pre-tricuspid systemic-pulmonary shunt from the left common carotid artery to the external jugular vein was established on the CA-JV and Treatment groups, but only ligations of both vessels were performed in Control group. Simvastatin (4 mg/kg/d) was administered to the Treatment group, and placebo to the CA-JV group. Twelve weeks later, the animals underwent a haemodynamic evaluation, followed by pulmonary tissue sampling for morphometry, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis.", 
    "25": "By week 12, rats in the CA-JV group had higher right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), medial area/total area (MA/TA) and percentage of fibrous tissue (F%) than those in the Control group. These changes were associated with up-regulation of MMP-1,9 mRNA and increased expression of MMP-1,9 proteins. Pretreatment with simvastatin decreased the shunt-induced RVSP, MA/TA and F% in pulmonary arteries. In addition, lung MMP-1,9 mRNA and proteins levels decreased toward normal levels in simvastatin-treated rats.", 
    "26": "Simvastatin ameliorated the structural and functional derangements of pulmonary arterioles caused by the CA-JV shunt, partly associated with the suppression of up-regulated MMP-1, as well as MMP-9. Simvastatin may play a role in the treatment of systemic-pulmonary shunt-induced PAH diseases, such as congenital heart disease.", 
    "27": "Combination-drug therapy takes advantage of the complementary action of their individual components, thereby potentiating its therapeutic effect. Potential disadvantages include side effects that are not foreseen on basis of the data available from drug monotherapy. Here, we used a systems biology approach to understand both the efficacy and the side effects of a cholesterol-lowering drug-combination therapy on the basis of the biological pathways and molecular processes affected by each drug alone or in combination.", 
    "28": "ApoE*3Leiden transgenic mice, a mouse model with human-like cholesterol-lowering drug responses, were treated with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, alone and in combination. Analyses included functional responses, viz. effects on cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, and atherosclerosis, and measurement of global gene expression, and identification of enriched biological pathways and molecular processes. Combination therapy reduced plasma cholesterol, plasma inflammation markers, and atherosclerosis stronger than the single drugs did. Systems biology analysis at the level of biological processes shows that the therapeutic benefit of combined therapy is largely the result of additivity of the complementary mechanisms of action of the two single drugs. Importantly, combination therapy also exerted a significant effect on 16 additional and mostly NF-\u03baB-linked signaling processes, 11 of which tended to be regulated in a similar direction with monotherapy.", 
    "29": "This study shows that gene expression analysis together with bioinformatics pathway analysis has the potential to help predict and identify drug combination-specific complementary and side effects.", 
    "30": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a substantial public health problem. The majority of VTE events are associated with transient periods of heightened risk, such as prolonged hospitalization, undergoing major surgery, experiencing trauma or lower extremity immobility, use of oral contraceptives, or having active cancer. Although pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis agents (eg, unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, warfarin, and novel oral anticoagulants) are effective, they remain underused, with concerns about increased bleeding risk often cited as a reason. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (ie, statins), although used primarily for lipid lowering and arterial thrombosis risk reduction, have pleiotrophic effects that affect coagulation and inflammation, and do not increase bleeding risk. There is emerging evidence to suggest that through these pleiotrophic effects, statins may be effective in reducing the incidence of VTE. This article summarizes the literature with regard to statins' effect on VTE and suggests that additional investigations are needed to assess a potential adjunctive role for primary VTE thromboprophylaxis.", 
    "31": "Evidence suggests that statins may modify the immune response against HIV. The aim was to evaluate the antiretroviral and immunomodulatory effects of lovastatin in HIV-infected patients, na\u00efve for antiretroviral therapy.", 
    "32": "Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase-II clinical trial. Primary outcomes were plasma viral load and circulating CD4+ T cell count, after 6 and 12 months of treatment; secondary outcomes were CD8+ T cell count, expression of activation markers (CD38 and HLA-DR) on T cells, and clinical outcomes. With a power of 90% to detect both a decrease of 0.3\u00a0log10 in plasma HIV-1 RNA copies and an increase of 20% in the CD4+ T cell count, we estimated a required sample size of 110 HIV-infected patients (55 per group). The results were analyzed by a model of repeated measurements using Generalized Estimating Equations.", 
    "33": "Patients were randomized to receive either lovastatin (n\u00a0=\u00a055) or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a057). During the 12-month follow-up, there was no effect of lovastatin either on viral load (estimated average change\u00a0=\u00a00.157\u00a0copies/mL; CI 95%\u00a0=\u00a0-0.099 to 0.414), or on the CD4+ T cell count (estimated average change\u00a0=\u00a0-26.1\u00a0cells/\u03bcL; CI 95%\u00a0=\u00a0-89.8 to 37.6). Moreover, there were no significant differences in secondary outcomes.", 
    "34": "Daily administration of lovastatin (40\u00a0mg) for one year in HIV-infected patients, na\u00efve for antiretroviral therapy, had no significant effect on HIV replication, the CD4+ T cell count, or the activation level of T cells. (www.clinicaltrials.gov; ID NCT00721305).", 
    "35": "The clinical benefits of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are closely related to their cholesterol-lowering properties. However, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase may also lead to pleiotropic effects due to the ability to inhibit the synthesis of non-steroidal isoprenoid compounds, thus exerting extra-beneficial effect in preventing atherosclerosis beyond their effect on the lipid profile. To identify new drug targets by means of which statins can promote some of their beneficial effects we used a global proteomic approach to analyse the secretome of endothelial cells, a major class of proteins that control a multitude of biological and physiological processes. Differentially expressed proteins were identified using a data-independent, label-free, mass spectrometry-based method. A total of 273 proteins were identified, including 112 that were differentially expressed: 29 uniquely expressed in control cells, 14 uniquely expressed in statin-treated cells, 51 down-regulated by statin, and 18 up-regulated by statin. Gene ontology analysis revealed modulated biological processes related to proteolysis, cellular component organisation and biogenesis, and response to stress. The findings were validated by biochemical assays, thus confirming the effectiveness of our proteomic approach. In conclusion, this study underlines the role of proteomics for the discovery of novel and unpredictable targets of statins.", 
    "36": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA), are important lipid-lowering agents. After two decades of laboratory and clinical studies, their pleiotropic effects appear well-established. One of these effects is through the regulation of Rac1 and NADPH oxidases. Relatively few human trials have been carried out with regards to the action of statins on Rac1 and NADPH oxidases, but similar positive effects were also observed in blood vessels and myocardium of participants in the trials. Besides, more specific biomarkers for the antioxidation effects of statins have been developed in the recent two years; both monitoring of the progress of disease and the effects of medical therapy will be possible. Further development of the potency and specificity of statin may enhance their therapeutic potential on cardiovascular disease.", 
    "37": "In castrate resistant prostate cancer cells we investigated the cytotoxic effect of simvastatin and the mechanism involved.", 
    "38": "After treating PC3 and DU-145 cells with simvastatin, cell viability and apoptosis were determined using tetrazolium salt based colorimetric assay and annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining assay, respectively. To determine whether simvastatin affects the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway, we assessed I\u03baB\u03b1 and phosphorylated I\u03baB\u03b1 expression, and p65 and phosphorylated p65 subcellular localization by Western blot analysis. Also, changes in nuclear factor-\u03baB transcriptional activity were assessed using a luciferase reporter assay.", 
    "39": "After treating PC3 and DU-145 cells with 0, 20 or 40 \u03bcM simvastatin for 24, 48 or 72 hours, the proportion of viable cells decreased and the proportion of apoptotic cells increased in a dose and time dependent manner. Western blot analysis showed that simvastatin inhibited I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and degradation. It also demonstrated that simvastatin increased p65 protein levels in cytoplasmic fractions and decreased phosphorylated p65 protein levels in nuclear fractions but did not change p65 protein levels in cytoplasm. Luciferase reporter assay showed that simvastatin dose dependently reduced nuclear factor-\u03baB activity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot revealed that simvastatin inhibited nuclear factor-\u03baB regulated cIAP-1 and 2, cFLIP-S and XIAP expression in dose and time dependent fashion.", 
    "40": "Simvastatin inhibited castrate resistant prostate cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis. These effects were probably mediated by the inhibition of I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p50/p65 dimer in the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway.",

In a meta-analysis combining nonoverlapping data from 312,321 participants, naturally random allocation to long-term exposure to lower LDL-C was associated with a 54.5% (95% confidence interval: 48.8% to 59.5%) reduction in the risk of CHD for each mmol/l (38.7 mg/dl) lower LDL-C.

    "56": "Since the substrate specificities of OATP1B1, 1B3, and 2B1 are broad and overlapping, the contribution of each isoform to the overall hepatic uptake is of concern when assessing transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) or genetic polymorphism impact in the clinic. Herein, we quantitatively measured OATP proteins in cryopreserved hepatocytes, sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes (SCHH), and the liver, and examined the relationship with functional uptake of OATP substrates in an effort to identify the OATP isoform(s) contributing to the hepatic uptake of pitavastatin. The modulation of OATP expression in SCHH was found to be lot-dependent. However, OATP protein measurements averaged from 5 lots of SCHH were comparable to that of suspended hepatocytes. All three OATP transporters in suspended hepatocytes and SCHH were significantly lower than those in the liver. In SCHH, the uptake of CCK-8 and pravastatin was found to be associated with the expression of OATP1B3 and OATP1B1, respectively. In suspended hepatocytes, OATP1B1 appeared to show a positive trend with respect to the uptake of pitavastatin, which suggests a selective contribution of OATP1B1 to pitavastatin transport and thus an OATP quantitative protein expression-activity relationship. While the passive diffusion of rosuvastatin in SCHH was consistent across hepatocyte lots, the passive diffusion of pitavastatin varied over a broad range (>4-fold) in suspended hepatocytes and was inversely correlated with transporter-mediated uptake, presumably due to cell membrane alterations imparted by cryopreservation. Collectively, SCHH maintains OATP protein expression and membrane integrity and, if feasible when considering research goals, would be considered a superior tool for the characterization of in vitro transport parameters without the complication of membrane leakage.",

Here, we characterize the capacity of simvastatin to target DCs and modulate T-cell priming and Th17-cell differentiation, in a cohort of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). We report that simvastatin inhibits IL-1\u03b2, IL-23, TGF-\u03b2, IL-21, IL-12p70, and induces IL-27 secretion from DCs in RRMS patients, providing an inhibitory cytokine milieu for Th17 and Th1-cell differentiation. The effect on DCs is mediated via induction of SOCS1, SOCS3, and SOCS7 gene expression, which are associated with the inhibition of STAT1, STAT3, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. A geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor replicated simvastatin's effects on DC cytokine secretion, implicating that simvastatin-induced depletion of isoprenoids mediates this effect. Simvastatin inhibited antigen presentation by DCs via suppression of the MHC class I expression, costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD40, and by inducing a dramatic loss of dendritic processes. The changes in DC morphology were also mediated via inhibition of geranylgeranylation. The therapeutic use of geranylgeranylation inhibitors may provide selective inhibition of key pathogenic cytokines that drive the autoimmune response in MS; their use represents a promising therapeutic approach that requires further clinical testing.",

Genotyping results showed that the patient had a single-nucleotide polymorphism within genes encoding the organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 and ATP binding cassette sub-family B member 1, which predisposed him for statin-induced myopathy. He was also a poor metabolizer of cytochrome P450 2C19.

ATII cells are characterized by the presence of lamellar bodies (LBs), which store and secrete the surfactant protein-C (SP-C). Lung ischemia-reperfusion injury (LIRI) causes a distinct impairment of the ATII cell function, subsequently hindering lung repair by loss of ATI transdifferentiation. In this study, we provide new evidence that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin may restore the function of impaired ATII cells in vitro and in vivo. ATII cell lines, A549 (human) and MLE-12 (mouse), were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) injury. Simvastatin pretreatment at low (5-20 \u00b5M), but not high (50-100 \u00b5M) doses markedly reduced apoptosis and increased proliferation and SP-C expression. In a rat lung ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model, simvastatin treatment also increased ATII cell proliferation in vivo, as demonstrated by proliferating cell nuclear antigen/SP-C double staining. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the number and volume density of LBs were significantly increased in the simvastatin-treated rat lungs. The protective effects of simvastatin were reversed in vitro by PI3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors wortmannin and L-mevalonate, indicating that the PI3K/Akt and mevalonate pathways may be involved in simvastatin-induced ATII cell function restoration. These data demonstrate that an appropriate dose of simvastatin has a protective effect on LIRI in vitro and in vivo, due at least partially to restored ATII cell function via the HMG-CoA reductase pathway-dependent activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in a mevalonate pathway-dependent manner.",

We examined the killing effect of simvastatin on imatinib-sensitive and resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells (three kinds of CML cell lines representative of each hematopoietic lineage: K562, KCL22, and LAMA84) and T315I and E255K site-directed mutant cells (Ba/F3). The in-vivo effect of simvastatin was determined in K562-xenografted nude mice. Cotreatment with imatinib and simvastatin in imatinib-resistant CML cells showed a synergistic killing effect in K562-R, KCL22-R, LAMA84-R, and E255K mutant cells, but only an additive effect in the T315I mutant cell, although a single treatment of simvastatin strongly inhibited T315I mutant cells. Mechanisms of killing were an induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, through inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation, and activated STAT5 and STAT3. Simvastatin suppressed the growth of K562-transplanted tumors, and cotreatment with imatinib was more effective in reducing tumor size. Simvastatin also killed primary CD34 cells from patients with CML more efficiently, compared with CD34 CML cells. Our study shows a synergic effect of imatinib and simvastatin both in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant cells, but more effective synergism in resistant cells. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that a combination of simvastatin and imatinib may be a potential candidate for the treatment of imatinib-resistant CML.",

This process is accelerated in patients with hyperlipidemia. The molecular mechanism underlying this process is unknown. In this study, quiescent rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were treated in vitro with mechanical stretch stress (10% elongation) with and without oxLDL (25 \u03bcg/ml) in the presence and absence of simvastatin (2.5 \u03bcmol/L). The results demonstrate that stretch stress and oxLDL can each induce activation of ERK1/2 and Ki-67 expression in VSMCs, but the peak levels of ERK activation and Ki-67 expression were observed in groups subjected to both stretch stress and oxLDL. Simvastatin was found to inhibit increased ERK activation and Ki-67 expression in VSMCs subjected to stretch stress with or without oxLDL. Mechanically, simvastatin was also found to inhibit increased expression of LOX-1 (a receptor of oxLDL) in VSMCs subjected to stretch stress with or without oxLDL. Knockdown of LOX-1 via small interfering RNAs (siRNA-LOX-1) resulted in obvious inhibition of ERK activation in VSMCs subjected to stretch stress with and without oxLDL. These results suggest that combined stretch stress and oxLDL can additively promote the activation of ERK1/2 leading to accelerated proliferation of VSMCs (e.g. increased Ki-67 expression) via LOX-1 signal pathway. This was found to be partially inhibited by simvastatin. These results may provide important data for the treatment and prevention of hypertension with or without hyperlipidemia.",

    "103": "Intracranial aneurysms (IA) are a relatively frequent vascular abnormality. The prevailing opinion is that cerebral aneurysmal disease is related to hemodynamic and genetic factors, associated with structural weakness in the arterial wall which was acquired by a specific, often unknown, event. Possibly the trigger moment of aneurysm formation may depend on the dynamic arterial growth, which is closely related to aging/atherosclerosis. In most individuals, an endovascular/microsurgical approach is possible in order to obliterate the IA. However, in a number of patients with an unruptured IA (UIA), the neurosurgeon's decision is to just \"sit back, observe, and wait\", based on the favorable natural history of some of the UIAs. Furthermore, some individuals need to be kept under close observation since they have a higher chance of developing IA, especially those with at least two affected first-degree relatives with an IA, subjects with polycystic kidney disease, and patients who have undergone an aneurysm intervention. In these examples prophylactic strategies should be adopted, if it is at all possible. The main question is deciding the best option of clinical treatment for these cases, when surgical approach is contraindicated, or for those subjects who are more prone to develop an IA. In the present article, we hypothetically suggest a pharmacologic form of treatment with statins, beta-adrenergic blocker agents, and/or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blockers to inhibit or slow down IA formation, taking into consideration some pathophysiological aspects related to aneurysmal development, such as: hemodynamic stress, arterial wall inflammation, nitric oxide formation, and atheromatous disease.", 
    "104": "Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) became standard treatment modality for coronary revascularization. However, it is associated with endothelial cell denudation, which may predispose to in-stent thrombosis and restenosis. Since statins may inhibit vascular cell proliferation, one may fear that their early administration will delay post-PCI re-endothelialization. We have therefore employed an in vitro scratch assay to examine how atorvastatin affects endothelial cell wound healing. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were grown to confluence and wounded by scraping. Scratch healing in the presence or absence of atorvastatin was monitored by time-lapse photo-microscopy. In addition cells were assessed for viability (MTT assay), migration (chemotaxis chamber), proliferation ((3)H-thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation), and cytokine production (immunoassays). The exposure of HUVEC to atorvastatin resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and proliferation. However, this effect was observed only at doses \u22651 \u03bcM, which is well above the concentrations seen in vivo. At clinically relevant doses (\u22640.1 \u03bcM) atorvastatin did not impair wound closure, nor did it inhibit cell viability, proliferation, and migration. It did however reduce the constitutive and the stimulated release of cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1), adhesion molecules (sICAM-1) and matrix proteins (fibronectin). We conclude that atorvastatin at doses corresponding to concentrations seen in serum during standard therapy does not impair endothelial cell regeneration after injuries mimicking those occurring during PCI.

Significant evidence exists that low serum cholesterol levels may be harmful in HF. This study sought to determine the optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level in patients hospitalized with acute HF. Patients were included if they presented to the hospital with acute HF and had a lipid panel drawn during admission. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes were rates of major cardiovascular (CV) events, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, and orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT). A total of 2428 patients were followed for a mean of 2.9\u00b12.2 years. For the entire cohort, when compared with those with LDL levels >130 mg/dL, all-cause mortality was higher in those with LDL levels <71 mg/dL (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-2.167; P<.01). Results were similar when analyzing patients with LVEF \u226440%, HF of ischemic etiology only, and in statin users. The rates of CV events, LVAD implantation, or OHT in any comparison did not differ.

Because of concerns with her chronic kidney disease (CKD), we temporarily stopped all her drug treatments and started insulin treatment for her type 2 diabetes (T2D). A month later when her T2D was stabilised, we prescribed atorvastatin and an omega-3 fatty acid ethyl ester supplement to treat her hypertriglyceridemia. Within two months her blood lipids were within the recommended range. In patients with stage 3-5 CKD, it is not advisable to prescribe the fibrate gemfibrozil, particularly in combination with a statin that is metabolised predominantly in the kidneys. To minimise adverse events without compromise on efficacy, we used a combination of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters, which are not metabolised in the kidneys, with a statin that is minimally metabolised in the kidneys for the treatment of her hyperlipidemia.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the correlation between altered cholesterol metabolism and the neurological deficits are, for the most part, not clear. NPC disease and SLOS are caused by mutations in genes involved in the biosynthesis or intracellular trafficking of cholesterol, respectively. However, the types of neurological impairments, and the areas of the brain that are most affected, differ between these diseases. Some, but not all, studies indicate that high levels of plasma cholesterol correlate with increased risk of developing AD. Moreover, inheritance of the E4 isoform of apolipoprotein E (APOE), a cholesterol-carrying protein, markedly increases the risk of developing AD. Whether or not treatment of AD with statins is beneficial remains controversial, and any benefit of statin treatment might be due to anti-inflammatory properties of the drug. Cholesterol balance is also altered in HD and PD, although no causal link between dysregulated cholesterol homeostasis and neurodegeneration has been established. Some important considerations for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases are the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier to many therapeutic agents and difficulties in reversing brain damage that has already occurred. This article focuses on how cholesterol balance in the brain is altered in several neurodegenerative diseases, and discusses some commonalities and differences among the diseases.",

However recent studies revealed that cholesterol lowering treatment substantially reduce the risk of dementia. The objectives of this study were to analyze the effect of statins on memory function and to establish the relationship between increase/decrease in cholesterol synthesis, total cholesterol level and memory function in animals. We examined the relationship between biosynthesis of cholesterol and memory function using two statins (lipophilic simvastatin and hydrophilic pravastatin) and high cholesterol diet in mice for 15\u00a0days and 4\u00a0months. Memory performance was evaluated with two different behavioral tests and various biochemical parameters such as serum cholesterol, whole brain cholesterol, brain 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) activity and brain acetylcholine esterase (AChE) activity. We found that statin treatment for 4\u00a0months, but not for 15\u00a0days, showed significant improvement in memory function whereas high cholesterol diet showed significant impairment of memory. However long-term statin treatment showed significant decrease in serum cholesterol level as well as brain AChE level. Moreover high cholesterol diet showed significant decrease in memory function with an increase in serum cholesterol level as well as brain AChE level. There is no direct correlation between brain cholesterol level, as well as HMG-CoA activity with memory function regulation. However there is definite link between plasma cholesterol level and AChE level. A long-standing plasma cholesterol alteration may be essential to regulate memory function which in turn might be mediated through AChE modulated pathway.",

Restoration of membrane cholesterol by liposomal delivery corrects the above defects and offers protection in infected hamsters. To reinforce further the protective role of cholesterol in VL, mice were either provided a high-cholesterol (atherogenic) diet or underwent statin treatment. Subsequent LD infection showed that an atherogenic diet is associated with protection, whereas hypocholesterolemia due to statin treatment confers susceptibility to the infection. This observation was validated in apolipoprotein E knockout mice (AE) mice that displayed intrinsic hypercholesterolemia with hepatic granuloma, production of host-protective cytokines, and expansion of antileishmanial CD8(+)IFN- \u03b3 (+) and CD8(+)IFN- \u03b3 (+)TNF- \u03b1 (+) T cells in contrast to the wild-type C57BL/6 (BL/6) mice when infected with LD.

DR was induced in male Wistar rats by S.C. administration of streptozotocin (STZ) and oral treatment with gavage of simvastatin. Circulating EPC and serum nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured by flow cytometry and the Greiss method, respectively. mRNA expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in retinal tissue were quantified by Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). CD31 expression, VEGF expression and retinal vascular permeability of DR were evaluated three months after STZ administration. Our results show that circulating EPCs were considerably lower in DR rats when compared to controls. Simvastatin treatment increased levels of circulating EPCs and NO. Additionally, it decreased mRNA expression levels of iNOS, Ang-1, and Ang-2, while increasing eNOS mRNA expression in retinal tissue. Retina tissue layers in simvastatin treated rats exhibited decreased edema and became organized when compared to non-simvastatin treated rats. These results suggest simvastatin increases circulating EPCs, consequently suppressing the formation and progression of DR.

The key feature of the methodology is that an excipient is added to the formulation only when it is demonstrated that it is required to improve processability or performance of the formulation. To evaluate this approach, three compounds: simvastatin, etoricoxib, and metformin hydrochloride were selected as model drug substances. These compounds differ significantly with respect to their particle size distributions, wettability, and solubility. The compounds were granulated using a range of granulation fluid levels, with or without a polymeric binder. Granule size distribution, strength, flowability, dissolution, and compactibility were characterized. Select granulations were further compressed into tablets, both \"as-is\" and with addition of extragranular excipients. One formulation was also investigated in an in vivo dog PK study.

The lipid profile of these patients and those with metabolic syndrome is characterized by the concurrent presence of qualitative as well as quantitative lipoprotein abnormalities: low levels of HDL, increased triglycerides, and prevalence of LDL particles that are smaller and denser than normal. This lipid phenotype has been defined as atherogenic dyslipidemia. Overwhelming evidences demonstrate that all components of the atherogenic dyslipidemia are important risk-factors for cardiovascular diseases. Optimal reduction of cardiovascular risk through comprehensive management of atherogenic dyslipidemias basically depends of the presence of efficacious lipid-modulating agents (beyond statin-based reduction of LDL-C). The most important class of medications which can be effectively used nowadays to combat atherogenic dyslipidemias is the fibrates. From a clinical point of view, in all available 5 randomized control trials beneficial effects of major fibrates (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, bezafibrate) were clearly demonstrated and were highly significant in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. In these circumstances, the main determinant of the overall results of the trial is mainly dependent of the number of the included appropriate patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. In a meta-analysis of dyslipidemic subgroups totaling 4726 patients a significant 35% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular events was observed compared with a non significant 6% reduction in those without dyslipidemia. However, different fibrates may have a somewhat different spectrum of effects. Currently only fenofibrate was investigated and proved to be effective in reducing microvascular complications of diabetes. Bezafibrate reduced the severity of intermittent claudication. Cardinal differences between bezafibrate and other fibrates are related to the effects on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance. Bezafibrate is the only clinically available pan - (alpha, beta, gamma) PPAR balanced activator. Bezafibrate decreases blood glucose level, HbA1C, insulin resistance and reduces the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo or other fibrates. Among major fibrates, bezafibrate appears to have the strongest and fenofibrate the weakest effect on HDL-C. Current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events because even intensive statin therapy does not eliminate the residual cardiovascular risk associated with low HDL and/or high triglycerides. As compared with statin monotherapy (effective mainly on LDL-C levels and plaque stabilization), the association of a statin with a fibrate will also have a major impact on triglycerides, HDL and LDL particle size. Moreover, in the specific case of bezafibrate one could expect neutralizing of the adverse pro-diabetic effect of statins. Though muscle pain and myositis is an issue in statin/fibrate treatment, adverse interaction appears to occur to a significantly greater extent when gemfibrozil is administered. However, bezafibrate and fenofibrate seems to be safer and better tolerated. Combined fibrate/statin therapy is more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control and may lead to additional cardiovascular risk reduction, as could be suggested for fenofibrate following ACCORD Lipid study subgroup analysis and for bezafibrate on the basis of one small randomized study and multiple observational data. Therefore, in appropriate patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia fibrates- either as monotherapy or combined with statins - are consistently associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events. Fibrates currently constitute an indispensable part of the modern anti-dyslipidemic arsenal for patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia.",

In cerebral arteries, K(Ca)2.3 loss is associated with NO synthase inhibition, but is restored if TP receptors are blocked. The Rho/Rho kinase pathway is central for TP signalling and statins indirectly inhibit this pathway. The possibility that Rho kinase inhibition and statins sustain K(Ca)2.3 hyperpolarization was investigated in rat middle cerebral arteries (MCA).",

TP receptor stimulation lead to loss of K(Ca)2.3 mediated hyperpolarization, an effect that was reversed by Rho kinase inhibitors or simvastatin. K(Ca)2.3 activity was lost in L-NAME-treated arteries, but was restored by Rho kinase inhibition or statin treatment. The restorative effect of simvastatin was blocked after incubation with geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate to circumvent loss of isoprenylation.",

Lovastatin at high doses inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry, we identified the up-regulation of the actin-binding protein transgelin 2 in endothelial cells following treatment with lovastatin. Changes in transgelin 2 levels were confirmed by Western blot and confocal microscopy. We further demonstrated that the Rho signaling inactivation and actin depolymerization contributed to the up-regulation of transgelin 2. The knockdown of transgelin 2 by siRNA dramatically enhanced endothelial migration and tube formation, and meanwhile attenuated the inhibitory effects of lovastatin on cell motility. Moreover, the lovastatin-induced inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation was also reversed by transgelin 2 knockdown. The activation of Rho GTPase in the absence of transgelin 2 may represent a mechanism underlying the regulation of phosphorylated myosin light chain by transgelin 2.",

Major CVD events and deaths were obtained from the national hospital admissions database and death register. The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for CVD and mortality in T1DM (n\u200a=\u200a21,789) versus the non-diabetic population (3.96 million) was estimated using Poisson regression. The age-adjusted IRR for first CVD event associated with T1DM versus the non-diabetic population was higher in women (3.0: 95% CI 2.4-3.8, p<0.001) than men (2.3: 2.0-2.7, p<0.001) while the IRR for all-cause mortality associated with T1DM was comparable at 2.6 (2.2-3.0, p<0.001) in men and 2.7 (2.2-3.4, p<0.001) in women. Between 2005-2007, among individuals with T1DM, 34 of 123 deaths among 10,173 who were <40 years and 37 of 907 deaths among 12,739 who were \u226540 years had an underlying cause of death of coma or diabetic ketoacidosis. Among individuals 60-69 years, approximately three extra deaths per 100 per year occurred among men with T1DM (28.51/1,000 person years at risk), and two per 100 per year for women (17.99/1,000 person years at risk). 28% of those with T1DM were current smokers, 13% achieved target HbA(1c) of <7% and 37% had very poor (\u22659%) glycaemic control. Among those aged \u226540, 37% had blood pressures above even conservative targets (\u2265140/90 mmHg) and 39% of those \u226540 years were not on a statin. Although many of these risk factors were comparable to those previously reported in other developed countries, CVD and mortality rates may not be generalizable to other countries. Limitations included lack of information on the specific insulin therapy used.",

Among health beliefs, the factor most related to medication adherence was behavioral intent (odds ratio, 5.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.84 to 15.06).

We investigated the effect of low-dose fluvastatin (2 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) on antioxidant enzyme activities [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase], vascular reactivity changes and oxidatively induced DNA damage in early stage of atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. The animals were divided into three groups each composed of 10 rabbits. The control group received a regular rabbit chow diet, and the cholesterol group had hypercholesterolemic diet (2%, 4 weeks). The fluvastatin group was given hypercholesterolemic diet plus fluvastatin. Dietary intake of cholesterol significantly increased total cholesterol levels in rabbits (control, 0.85\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29; cholesterol, 12.04\u2009\u00b1\u20094.61; fluvastatin, 8.07\u2009\u00b1\u20092.72 mmol l(-1)). Hypercholesterolemic diet revealed discernible fatty streaks in arcus aortae. Fluvastatin significantly reduced the areas of the lesions. The diet significantly increased SOD activities in both erythrocyte and tissue. Treatment with fluvastatin normalized the increased activity of SOD in both erythrocyte and aortic tissues from the cholesterol group. Cholesterol feeding decreased the sensitivity to acetylcholine, and treatment with fluvastatin significantly restored the diminished sensitivity to acetylcholine in thoracic aortae. Cholesterol feeding caused oxidatively induced DNA damage in liver tissues determined by the increased levels of 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OH-Gua) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua). Fluvastatin decreased only FapyGua level in liver. In conclusion, our results may suggest that fluvastatin seems to play a protective role on high cholesterol-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage.",

Metformin is purportedly associated with a reduced risk for various cancers. This case-control study evaluated risk factors for ICC and explored the effects of metformin on ICC risk in a clinic/hospital-based cohort. ICC patients observed at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) between January 2000 and May 2010 were identified. Age, sex, ethnicity, and residential area-matched controls were selected from among Mayo Clinic Biobank participants. The associations between potential factors and ICC risk were determined. Six hundred and twelve cases and 594 controls were identified. Factors associated with increased ICC risk included biliary tract diseases (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 81.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.2-598.8; P < 0.001), cirrhosis (AOR, 8.0; 95% CI: 1.8-36.5; P = 0.007), diabetes (AOR, 3.6; 95% CI: 2.3-5.5; P < 0.001), and smoking (AOR, 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3-2.1; P < 0.001). Compared to diabetic patients not treated with metformin, the odds ratio (OR) for ICC for diabetic patients treated with metformin was significantly decreased (OR, 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.9; P = 0.04).

Although dyslipidemia is a well-established CV risk factor in the general population, the relationship between lipid disorders and CV risk in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less clear. Despite the clear evidence that statins reduce the risk of atherosclerotic events and death from cardiac causes in individuals without CKD, the use of statins in patients with kidney disease is significantly less frequent. For a long time, one of the explanations was the lack of a prospective, randomized, controlled study designed specifically to CKD patients. After recent publication of the data from Study of Heart and Renal Protection trial, given the safety and potential efficacy of statins, this lipid-lowering treatment should be administered more frequently to individuals with CKD stage 1-4, as well as those undergoing dialysis.",

Autophagy was activated in neurons in the acute phase after SAH, while its role in EBI has not been examined. This study was designed to explore the effects of autophagy on EBI post-SAH in rats. A modified endovascular perforating SAH model was established under monitoring of intracranial pressure. Extent of autophagy was regulated by injecting autophagy-regulating drugs (3-methyladenine, wortmannin and rapamycin) 30\u00a0min pre-SAH intraventricularly. Simvastatin (20\u00a0mg/kg) was prophylactically orally given 14\u00a0days before SAH induction. Mortality, neurological scores, brain water content and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability were evaluated at 24\u00a0h post-SAH. Microtubule-associated protein light chain-3 (LC3 II/I) and beclin-1 were detected for monitoring of autophagy flux. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated UTP nick end labeling, expression of cleaved caspase-3 and cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments were used to detect apoptosis. The results showed that mortality was reduced in rapamycin and simvastatin treated animals. When autophagy was inhibited by 3-methyladenine and wortmannin, the neurological scores were decreased, brain water content and BBB permeability were further aggravated and neuronal apoptosis was increased when compared with the SAH animals. Autophagy was further activated by rapamycin and simvastatin, and apoptosis was inhibited and EBI was ameliorated. The present results indicated that activation of autophagy decreased neuronal apoptosis and ameliorated EBI after SAH. Aiming at autophagy may be a potential effective target for preventing EBI after SAH.",

The aim of this study was to confirm the association of PAD and B48 in a larger group of patients with DM2 and the relation of B48 with the preheparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) mass. We studied 456 patients with DM2. PAD was defined as an ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.9. Apolipoprotein B48 was quantified by ELISA. Apo B48 was significantly higher in the group with an ABI <0.9 than the groups with ABI of 0.9-1.3 and >1.3 (10.7 \u00b1 6.28 vs. 9.24 \u00b1 5.5 vs. 9.17 \u00b1 8.8 mg/L, ANOVA test, p < 0.05). B48 was independently associated with an ABI <0.9 (OR 1.053; 95 % CI, 1.013-1.094; p < 0.05), together with smoking and duration of diabetes. The preheparin LPL mass was similar in the patients with and without PAD. In conclusion, we confirmed that fasting B48 is an independent marker of PAD in patients with DM2, unrelated to the preheparin LPL mass, statin therapy or glucose lowering treatment.",

DHCR24 has also been involved in cell growth, senescence and cellular response to oncogenic and oxidative stress. Despite its important roles, little is known about the transcriptional mechanisms controlling DHCR24 gene expression. We analysed the proximal promoter region and the cholesterol-mediated regulation of DHCR24. A putative SRE (sterol-regulatory element) at -98/-90 bp of the transcription start site was identified. Other putative regulatory elements commonly found in SREBP (SRE-binding protein)-targeted genes were also identified. Sterol responsiveness was analysed by luciferase reporter assays of approximately 1 kb 5'-flanking region of the human DHCR24 gene in HepG2 and SK-N-MC cells. EMSAs (electrophoretic mobility-shift assays) and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays demonstrated cholesterol-dependent recruitment and binding of SREBPs to the putative SRE. Given the presence of several CACCC-boxes in the DHCR24 proximal promoter, we assessed the role of KLF5 (Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5) in androgen-regulated DHCR24 expression. DHT (dihydrotestosterone) increased DHCR24 expression synergistically with lovastatin. However, DHT was unable to activate the DHCR24 proximal promoter, whereas KLF5 did, indicating that this mechanism is not involved in the androgen-induced stimulation of DHCR24 expression. The results of the present study allow the elucidation of the mechanism of regulation of the DHCR24 gene by cholesterol availability and identification of other putative cis-acting elements which may be relevant for the regulation of DHCR24 expression.",

However, their social value at the US population level has not previously been studied. From an economic perspective, social value measures the quantity of resources--in monetary terms--that society would be willing to give up in order to retain the survival gains resulting from statin therapy. Using combined population and clinical data, this article calculates statins' social value to consumers, or the value of survival benefits above actual payments for the drug, and to producers, or drug revenues, for the period 1987-2008. National survey data suggest that statin therapy reduced low-density lipoprotein levels by 18.8 percent, which translated into roughly 40,000 fewer deaths, 60,000 fewer hospitalizations for heart attacks, and 22,000 fewer hospitalizations for strokes in 2008. For people starting statin therapy in 1987-2008, consumers captured $947.4 billion (76 percent) of the total social value of the survival gains. Even greater consumer benefits could be achieved in the future if statins were prescribed in full compliance with cholesterol guidelines and patients adhered to prescribed regimens.

We found that a low copayment for generic statins is the strongest factor influencing the use of these drugs, and eliminating the copay altogether has an especially large effect. Other tools that have an effect are higher copays and prior authorization or \"step therapy\" requirements for popular brand-name statins. In this drug class, where generics can be readily substituted for brand-name drugs for most people, adoption of the policies most effective in encouraging generic use could lead to considerable savings for the plans, Medicare, and enrollees. We estimate that every 10\u00a0percent increase in the use of generic, rather than brand-name, statins would reduce Medicare costs by about $1\u00a0billion annually.

As one of the first studies to evaluate a health plan's VBID program, our findings demonstrate that insurer-based VBID programs may yield results similar to those achieved by employer-based programs.", 
    "208": "The use of statins is widespread across disease areas because many patients have comorbidities. Given that these drugs have become common as comedications, it is essential to have an understanding of the potential risks of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between statins and candidate drugs in development. Although the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is known to play a substantial role in statin-related DDI risk, other transporters and metabolizing enzymes can also be involved. Consequently, a holistic approach to risk assessment is required, tailored to each statin. Using evidence from pharmacogenetics, DDIs, and literature on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) in humans, this review identifies pathways that contribute the most to, and are therefore the most critical to, the disposition of each statin. It also provides an understanding of the expected theoretical maximum increase in systemic exposure if the disposition of a statin is inhibited. Finally, on a statin-by-statin basis, we propose in vitro inhibition studies that should be routinely conducted during drug development so as to better assess DDI risk.", 
    "209": "Intake of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), is associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, particularly acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, limited data are available regarding the association between serum n-3 PUFA levels and heart failure (HF) events in survivors of AMI.", 
    "210": "We evaluated whether serum DHA and EPA levels were associated with HF-free survival and HF hospitalization rates after AMI. A total of 712 patients were divided into 3 groups according to their tertile serum levels of DHA and EPA (Low, Middle, and High). Propensity-score-stratified Cox regression analysis revealed that DHA- and EPA-Low groups presented statistically significant worse HF-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.72, P=0.0358, and HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.05-2.72, P=0.0280, respectively), with the EPA-Low group having a higher risk of HF hospitalization (HR 2.40, 95% CI 1.21-4.75, P=0.0097) than the DHA-Low group (HR 1.72, 95% CI 0.86-3.45, P=0.1224). The relationship between a low DHA or EPA level and decreased HF-free survival was almost common to all subgroups; however, the effect of low serum EPA on HF hospitalization was prominent in male patients, and those with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or without statin therapy.", 
    "211": "Low levels of circulating n-3 PUFA are associated with decreased HF-free survival in post-AMI patients.", 
    "212": "We determined whether pre-operative statin therapy is associated with a decrease in the incidence of infections after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).", 
    "213": "A retrospective cohort study of 6253 patients undergoing isolated CABG, from the Texas Heart Institute Database from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2010 (3869 receiving statins and 2384 not receiving statins) was conducted. Primary outcome was the development of any postoperative infection (composite of deep-sternal wound infection, leg harvest-site infection, pneumonia, or sepsis) after CABG. Secondary outcome was the association between pre-operative statin use and individual incidence of each aforementioned infection. Logistic regression analyses were performed.", 
    "214": "Incidence of any postoperative infection in patients who received statins pre-operatively was 6.5% compared to 8.3% in patients who did not receive statins. Pre-operative statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the primary outcome (odds ratio (OR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60-0.90) in adjusted models. Among individual secondary outcomes, pre-operative statin therapy was associated with a reduced incidence of sternal wound infections (2.5% vs. 3.2%, OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8) and leg harvest site infections (0.6% vs. 1.3%, OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.2-0.8). Pre-operative statin therapy was not associated with a reduced incidence of pneumonia or sepsis.", 
    "215": "Pre-operative statin use is associated with a decrease in overall incidence of post-operative infections after CABG. We propose immunomodulatory effects of statins leading to a dampening of inflammatory cascade as the cause of our findings.", 
    "216": "The objective of the present study was to develop stable pellets-layered Simvastatin (SIM) nanosuspensions with improved dissolution and bioavailability. The nanosuspensions were prepared with 7% HPMC, antioxidant 0.03% butylated hydroxyanisole and 0.2% citric acid (m/v) by low temperature grinding. After that, SDS with SIM was in a ratio of 1:5 (m/m), was evenly dispersed in the nanosuspensions. Then, they were layered on the surface of sugar pellets. The mean particle size of the SIM nanosuspensions was 0.74 \u00b5m, and 80.6% of the particles was below 1 \u00b5m in size. The pellets could re-disperse into nanoparticle status in the dissolution medium. In 900\u2009mL pH 7.0 phosphate solutions, the dissolution of the layered pellets was better than that of commercial tablets. Also, nearly 100% of the drug dissolved from the pellets within 5\u2009min under sink conditions. During the stability studies, SIM pellets exhibited good physical and chemical stability. The relative bioavailability of SIM and Simvastatin \u03b2-hydroxy acid (SIMA) for nanosuspensions layered pellets compared with commercial tablets was 117% and 173%, respectively. The bioavailability of SIMA was improved significantly (p < 0.05), confirming the improvement of bioavailability. Thus, the present study demonstrates that the pellet-layered SIM nanosuspensions improved both the dissolution and bioavailability of SIM.", 
    "217": "The generalized term 'peripheral vascular disease' (PVD) may be used to refer to vascular disorders in any non-coronary arterial bed. The more specific term 'peripheral arterial disease' (PAD) is used to refer to a more specific process, atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremities. PAD is common. Conservative estimates suggest more than 8 \u2009million Americans may be affected by PAD. Since atherosclerosis is a systemic process, PAD should be identified as a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. However, PAD remains an under-diagnosed and under-recognized risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PAD symptoms may range from non-specific ambulatory leg complaints, to typical symptoms of intermittent claudication to critical limb ischaemia with rest pain, gangrene or ulceration. These symptoms directly impact quality of life and may affect functional capacity. There are two therapeutic goals for patients with PAD: first, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and second, to manage the lower extremity symptoms. This manuscript reviews the medical management of patients with PAD, briefly discussing the goals of cardiovascular risk factor modification and then focusing on pharmacological management strategies for patients with intermittent claudication and critical limb ischaemia.", 
    "218": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) can affect post-translational processes, thus being responsible for decreased farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of intracellular small G proteins such as Ras, Rho and Rac, essential for cell survival and proliferation. In this regard, recent in vitro and in vivo studies suggest a possible role for both statins and farnesyl transferase inhibitors in the treatment of malignancies. Within such a context, the aim of our study was to investigate effects of either simvastatin (at concentrations of 1, 15, and 30\u00a0\u03bcm) or the farnesyl transferase inhibitor R115777 (at concentrations of 0.1, 1, and 10\u00a0\u03bcm), on two cultures of human non-small lung cancer cells, adenocarcinoma (GLC-82) and squamous (CALU-1) cell lines. In particular, we evaluated actions of these two drugs on phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 group of mitogen-activated protein kinases and on apoptosis, plus on cell numbers and morphology.", 
    "219": "Western blotting was used to detect ERK phosphorylation, and to assess apoptosis by evaluating caspase-3 activation; apoptosis was also further assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assay. Cell counting was performed after trypan blue staining.", 
    "220": "In both GLC-82 and CALU-1 cell lines, simvastatin and R115777 significantly reduced ERK phosphorylation; this effect, which reached the greatest intensity after 36\u00a0h treatment, was paralleled by a concomitant induction of apoptosis, documented by significant increase in both caspase-3 activation and TUNEL-positive cells, associated with a reduction in cell numbers. Our results thus suggest that simvastatin and R115777 may exert, in susceptible lung cancer cell phenotypes, a pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative activity, which appears to be mediated by inhibition of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signalling cascade.", 
    "221": "We previously reported that statin myopathy is associated with impaired carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation in fast-twitch rodent skeletal muscle, which we hypothesised occurred as a result of forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) mediated upregulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4) gene transcription. Upregulation of FOXO gene targets known to regulate proteasomal and lysosomal muscle protein breakdown was also evident. We hypothesised that increasing CHO oxidation in vivo, using the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activator, dichloroacetate (DCA), would blunt activation of FOXO gene targets and reduce statin myopathy. Female Wistar Hanover rats were dosed daily for 12 days (oral gavage) with either vehicle (control, 0.5% w/v hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose 0.1% w/v polysorbate-80; n = 9), 88 mg( )kg(-1) day(-1) simvastatin (n = 8), 88 mg( )kg(-1) day(-1) simvastatin + 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) DCA (n = 9) or 88 mg kg(-1) day(-1) simvastatin + 40 mg kg(-1) day(-1) DCA (n = 9). Compared with control, simvastatin reduced body mass gain and food intake, increased muscle fibre necrosis, plasma creatine kinase levels, muscle PDK4, muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and cathepsin-L mRNA expression, increased PDK4 protein expression, and proteasome and cathepsin-L activity, and reduced muscle PDC activity. Simvastatin with DCA maintained body mass gain and food intake, abrogated the myopathy, decreased muscle PDK4 mRNA and protein, MAFbx and cathepsin-L mRNA, increased activity of PDC and reduced proteasome activity compared with simvastatin. PDC activation abolished statin myopathy in rodent skeletal muscle, which occurred at least in part via inhibition of FOXO-mediated transcription of genes regulating muscle CHO utilisation and protein breakdown.", 
    "222": "A key determinant of long-term survival in heart transplant recipients is the development of coronary vasculopathy. Both coronary macrovascular and microvascular disease are prognostically important. However, the relationship between these in transplant patients and the determinants of microvascular disease are not known.", 
    "223": "We reviewed the simultaneously obtained endomyocardial biopsies and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images of coronary arteries in 33 heart transplant recipients. Coronary microvascular disease was classified by light microscopy into four grades based on thickening of endothelial cell layer and stenotic versus nonstenotic medial wall thickening. Macrovascular disease was evaluated from IVUS studies and assigned into one of five grades based on the Stanford classification. Coronary microvascular and macrovascular diseases were compared.", 
    "224": "Age at transplantation was 26 (18) years; 67% were men, and the average time to posttransplantation study was 4 years. Endomyocardial biopsy revealed more advanced grade C and D microvascular disease in 45% and 36% of the patients, respectively. However, IVUS analysis for macrovascular disease revealed mostly lesser changes with grade 1 in 12%, grade 2 in 61%, and grade 3 in 21%. There was no significant correlation between grades of microvascular and macrovascular disease (P=0.10). Microvascular disease correlated positively with donor age (P=0.06) and treatment with tacrolimus (0=0.02) and statins (P=0.05).", 
    "225": "There is a poor relationship between coronary microvascular and macrovascular disease in patients with cardiac transplants, likely indicating divergent pathogenetic mechanisms. Microvascular disease increases with donor age. There is an intriguing positive relationship between microvascular disease and treatment with statins and tacrolimus.", 
    "226": "Aggressive risk factor modification using evidence-based secondary prevention strategies is recommended in coronary artery disease (CAD). Utilization of such strategies was compared in patients with nonobstructive CAD (NOCAD) and obstructive CAD (OCAD).", 
    "227": "Patients undergoing coronary angiography (excluding normal coronary angiograms), between January 2006 and June 2006, at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center were included. Demographic, clinical and treatment data were compared between the groups at baseline and 1 year.", 
    "228": "Of the 354 patients who underwent coronary angiography, 222 (63%) had follow-up data available at 12 \u00b1 2 months. The mean age in the NOCAD (n = 119) and OCAD (n = 103) groups was similar. There was a lower prevalence of hypertension and heart failure (P < 0.05) in the NOCAD group. Compared with the OCAD group, aspirin use was similar but statin use was lower in the NOCAD group (P = 0.008). At 1 year, statin use (P = 0001) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use (P = 0.001) were significantly lower, whereas the use of aspirin was numerically lower (P = 0.06) in the NOCAD group. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were at goal (<100 mg/dL) in the NOCAD group at baseline and 1 year, whereas the same slightly worsened in the OCAD group at 1 year.", 
    "229": "The use of evidence-based medical therapy is lower in patients with NOCAD compared with those with OCAD. Improved awareness among health care providers and a unified effort to implement secondary prevention strategies may help correct such deficiencies."
