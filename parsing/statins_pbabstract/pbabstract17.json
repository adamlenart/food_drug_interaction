The aims of this article are to review the current complex issues associated with statin use and to explore when novel treatment approaches should be considered. Statin discontinuation as well as adherence to statin therapy remain two of the greatest challenges for lipidologists. Evidence suggests that between 40 and 75% of patients discontinue their statin therapy within one year after initiation. Furthermore, whilst the reasons for persistence with statin therapy are complex, evidence shows that low-adherence to statins negatively impacts clinical outcomes and residual CV risk remains a major concern. Non-adherence or lack of persistence with long-term statin therapy in real-life may be the main cause of inadequate low density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with statins. There is a large need for the improvement of the use of statins, which have good safety profiles and are inexpensive. On the other hand, in a non-cost-constrained environment, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors should arguably be used more often in those patients in whom treatment with statins remains unsatisfactory.", 
    "1": "Gentamicin is a commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotic. However, its therapeutic use is limited by its nephrotoxicity. The mechanisms of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity are principally from renal inflammation and oxidative stress. Since atorvastatin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, exerts lipid-lowering effects, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory as well as anti-apoptotic effects, this study aimed to investigate the protective effects of atorvastatin against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Male Sprague Dawley rats were used and nephrotoxicity was induced by intraperitoneal injection of gentamicin, 100 mg/kg/day, for 15 days. Atorvastatin, 10 mg/kg/day, was administered by orally gavage 30 min before gentamicin injection on day 1 to 15 (pretreatment) or on day 10 to15 (delayed treatment). For only atorvastatin treatment group, it was given on day 1 to 15. At the end of the experiment, kidney weight, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine as well as renal inflammation (NF-\u03baB, TNF\u03b1R1, IL-6 and iNOS), renal fibrosis (TGF\u03b21), ER stress (calpain, GRP78, CHOP, and caspase 12) and apoptotic markers (cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2) as well as TUNEL assay were determined. Gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity was confirmed by marked elevations in serum urea and creatinine, kidney hypertrophy, renal inflammation, fibrosis, ER stress and apoptosis and attenuation of creatinine clearance. Atorvastatin pre and delayed treatment significantly improved renal function and decreased renal NF-\u03baB, TNF\u03b1R1, IL-6, iNOS and TGF\u03b21 expressions. They also attenuated calpain, GRP78, CHOP, caspase 12, Bax, and increased Bcl-2 expressions in gentamicin-treated rat. These results indicate that atorvastatin treatment could attenuate gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, substantiated by the reduction of inflammation, ER stress and apoptosis. The effect of atorvastatin in protecting from renal damage induced by gentamicin seems to be more effective when it beginning given along with gentamicin or pretreatment.", 
    "2": "Dyslipidemia is one of the primary causes of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, attention has been focused on the development of drugs that normalize lipid levels and exert an effect on markers of atherothrombosis, insulin resistance (IR), and inflammation. Atorvastatin is a drug with not only lipid-lowering potential, but it has multiple non-lipid effects. This study aimed to evaluate atorvastatin effects on lipid, adipokine, IR, and inflammatory statuses in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) in an in-hospital setting. This study included 66 patients with confirmed ST-segment elevation MI, who were treated with atorvastatin 20 mg/day starting on day 1 of MI, without any dose changes. The comparison group consisted of 60 patients receiving standard anti-anginal and anti-thrombotic therapy. During the hospital stay, both groups showed a reduction in total cholesterol level and free fatty acids and increased concentrations of apolipoprotein A, especially those patients receiving atorvastatin. On day 1 of MI, patients in both groups had elevated levels of leptin by 2.9- to 3.3-fold, but the leptin levels decreased by 40.3% and were significantly lower than in patients not taking statins. The treatment with atorvastatin was associated with a decrease in C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 by 23.1 and 49.2%, respectively, compared with baseline values. In the group of patients on standard therapy, there was a decrease of interleukin-6 by 31.7%. Atorvastatin administered early on during hospitalization to patients with MI contributed to the improvement of lipid, adipokine and pro-inflammatory statuses and decreased IR.", 
    "3": "Western diets induce obesity associated with an increased risk of hypercholesterolaemia. Indeed, obesity-induced hypercholesterolaemia is correlated with increased coronary cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal diet, high-fat and high-sucrose diet (HF/HS), HF/HS with green tea extract powder diet (HF/HS+GT), HF/HS with eriodictyol diet (HF/HS+Eri), or HF/HS with green tea extract powder and eriodictyol diet (HF/HS+GT+Eri) for 8 wk. Body weight was lower in the HF/HS+GT+Eri group than in the HF/HS group (-8.3%, p<0.01). The HF/HS diet elicited an upregulation of total cholesterol levels (-63%, p<0.001), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (-89%, p<0.001) were significantly suppressed by the GT+Eri diet. Conversely, no change (p>0.05) was observed in the HF/HS+GT and HF/HS+Eri groups. The HF/HS diet-induced hepatic mRNA increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) was ameliorated (-73%) by the oral administration of green tea extract and eriodictyol. Moreover, the GT+Eri diet suppressed HF/HS diet-induced upregulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase (HMGCS) (-75%, p<0.05). Furthermore, the LDL receptor (LDLR) levels were higher in the HF/HS+GT+Eri group (+50%, p<0.05) than in the HF/HS group. These results suggest that a combination of green tea and eriodictyol decreases cholesterol levels, particularly LDL levels, accompanied by the suppression of HMGCR and HMGCS levels and upregulation of LDLR levels in the liver.",

The animals were divided into 4 groups: control, high fat (HF), high fat plus 40 mg PIP/kg, and high fat plus 2 mg SIM/kg. At the end of the treatment, liver cholesterol, triglyceride, thiobaribituric reacting substances, superoxide dismutase (SOD), serum aminotransferase (AST), and alanine transferase (ALT) were measured. The result demonstrated that PIP and SIM significantly reduced the accumulation of cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipid peroxidation in the liver, while elevation of SOD was observed. The activities of AST and ALT significantly decreased in PIP when compared with the HF group. Our in vitro study of pancreatic lipase also showed the inhibitory effect of PIP higher than 30% at 5 mmol/L.

In this meta-analysis, the authors investigated whether statin treatment significantly reduced the incidence of cerebral vasospasm and delayed neurological deficits, promoting a better outcome after aneurysmal SAH. METHODS A literature search of the PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane Library databases was performed for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies investigating the effect of statin treatment. The end points of cerebral vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND), delayed cerebral infarction, mortality, and favorable outcome were statistically analyzed. RESULTS Six RCTs and 2 prospective cohort studies met the eligibility criteria, and a total of 1461 patients were included. The meta-analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of cerebral vasospasm (relative risk [RR] 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.96) in patients treated with statins after aneurysmal SAH. However, no significant benefit was observed for DIND (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.70-1.12), delayed cerebral infarction (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.33-1.31), mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39-1.24) or favorable outcome, according to assessment by the modified Rankin Scale or Glasgow Outcome Scale (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92-1.17).

FH patients have a strongly elevated LDL-C and in most cases maximal current treatment is not sufficient to reach the desired LDL targets.Therefore, FH patients have a large residual cardiovascular risk despite the use of statins and there is a medical need for new additional drugs to further lower LDL-C in patients with FH to improve their prognosis.PCSK9 inhibitors have shown great efficacy in lowering lipids with very few side effects. No synergism between statins and PCSK9 inhibition was observed in many trials, allowing clinicians to select a statin dose before considering the initiation of PCSK9-inhibitor therapy.In patients with FH, who are at risk for markedly accelerated atherosclerosis and premature cardiovascular death, also treatment with lomitapide or mipomersen has the potential to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and premature mortality.These new drugs will be probably reserved for the most severely affected FH patients and could help clinicians to reduce their residual cardiovascular risk.",

Abstracts of the 680 results were screened for inclusion. Reference lists of publications included were also screened for inclusion. Approximately 25% of the United States population has elevated (\u2265150\u00a0mg/dL) triglycerides (TG) putting them at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and pancreatitis. Risk factors for hypertriglyceridemia include genetics, lifestyle and diet, renal disease, endocrine disorders, and certain medications. Guidelines recommend that all patients with hypertriglyceridemia are advised on lifestyle modification to reduce TG to <150\u00a0mg/dL; a reduction in body weight of 5-10% can reduce TG by approximately 20%. For patients with TG <400\u00a0mg/dL, the primary goal is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with most guidelines recommending statin therapy. When TG is \u2265500\u00a0mg/dL the primary goal is to reduce TG levels to lower the risk of pancreatitis. Statin therapy (if LDL-C is elevated) in combination with a fibrate, or long-chain omega-3 fatty acid may be required. The Food and Drug Administration withdrew approval for niacin and some fibrates in combination with statins in April 2016 citing unfavorable benefit-risk profiles.

Atorvastatin is a widely used statin that has demonstrated antidepressant-like effect in predictable animal behavioral models and neuroprotective effect against A\u03b21-40 infusion. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of in vivo atorvastatin treatment against A\u03b21-40-induced changes in mood-related behaviors and biochemical parameters in ex vivo hippocampal slices from mice. Atorvastatin treatment (10\u00a0mg/kg, p.o., once a day for seven consecutive days) abolished depressive-like and anhedonic-like behaviors induced by A\u03b21-40 (400\u00a0pmol/site, icv) infusion. A\u03b21-40-induced hippocampal cell damage was reversed by atorvastatin treatment. A\u03b21-40 infusion decreased glutamate uptake in hippocampal slices, and atorvastatin did not altered it. Glutamine synthetase activity was not altered by any treatment. Atorvastatin also increased hippocampal mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF)/precursor BDNF (proBDNF) ratio, suggesting an increase of proBDNF to mBDNF cleavage. Accordingly, increased tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and p11 genic expression were observed in hippocampus of atorvastatin-treated mice. Atorvastatin displays antidepressant-like and neuroprotective effects against A\u03b21-40-induced toxicity, and these effects may involve tPA- and p11-mediated cleavage of proBDNF to mBDNF.",

Statins have been widely used to lower the cholesterol level in patients with cardiovascular disorders. Previous research has demonstrated potential role of statins in chondrocyte proliferation. This study addresses the proliferation-regulatory effect of lovastatin in rabbit chondrocytes as well as the underlying signaling mechanisms, thereby exploring its potential application in chondrocyte-related disorders, such as cartilage damage and osteoarthritis. Rabbit chondrocytes were treated with lovastatin at multiple concentrations, and the proliferation rate was measured by CCK-8 test. The results showed significant increase in chondrocyte proliferation under lovastatin treatment. Using real-time quantitative PCR, it was observed that the expression levels of COL2A1, SOX-9, Caspase-3, and MMP-3 genes were significantly changed by lovastatin treatment. Western blotting analysis showed that the abundance of COL2A1, SOX-9, MEK1/2, p-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, Caspase-3, and MMP-3 proteins was also significantly influenced by lovastatin treatment. Interleukine-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) is involved in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) by inducing articular cartilage and chondrocyte aging and senescence. In this study, we observed that lovastatin treatment inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced chondrocyte apoptosis, while the combined treatment of lovastatin and U0126 evidently offset the apoptosis-inhibiting effect of lovastatin in chondrocyte proliferation. The expressional level and protein abundance of COL2A1, SOX-9, MEK1/2, p-MEK1/2, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, caspase-3, and MMP-3 genes showed significant alterations under the combined treatment. Together, our results suggested that lovastatin significantly promoted proliferation and inhibited the IL-1\u03b2-induced apoptosis in rabbit chondrocytes, which was mediated by the MEK/ERK signaling.",

Here, we report the isolation and propagation of neuroblastoma sphere-forming cells with self-renewal and differentiation potential from tumors of the TH-MYCN mouse, an animal model of high-risk neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification. Transcriptional profiling reveals that mouse neuroblastoma sphere-forming cells acquire a metabolic program characterized by transcriptional activation of the cholesterol and serine-glycine synthesis pathways, primarily as a result of increased expression of sterol regulatory element binding factors and Atf4, respectively. This metabolic reprogramming is recapitulated in high-risk human neuroblastomas and is prognostic for poor clinical outcome. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the metabolic program markedly decreases the growth and tumorigenicity of both mouse neuroblastoma sphere-forming cells and human neuroblastoma cell lines.

We evaluated the chemopreventive effect of statins against all cancers in COPD patients and identified the statin with the strongest chemopreventive effect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients diagnosed with COPD at health care facilities in Taiwan (n = 116,017) from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2012, were recruited. Each patient was followed to assess the following protective and risk factors for all cancers: age; sex; comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia) and the Charlson comorbidity index [CCI]); urbanization level; monthly income; and nonstatin drug use. The index date of statins use was the date of COPD confirmation. Propensity scores (PSs) were derived using a logistic regression model to estimate the effect of statins by considering the covariates predicting intervention (statins) receipt. To examine the dose-response relationship, we categorized statin use into four groups in each cohort (<28 [statin nonusers], 28-90, 91-365, and >365 cumulative defined daily dose). RESULTS: After PS adjustment for age, sex, CCI, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, urbanization level, and monthly income, we analyzed the all-cancer risk. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for the all-cancer risk were lower among statin users than among statin nonusers (aHR = 0.46, 95% confidence interval: 0.43 to 0.50). The aHRs for the all-cancer risk were lower among patients using rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin than among statin nonusers (aHRs = 0.42, 0.55, 0.59, 0.66, and 0.78, respectively). Sensitivity analysis indicated that statins dose-dependently reduced the all-cancer risk. CONCLUSION: Statins dose-dependently exert a significant chemopreventive effect against various cancers in COPD patients. In particular, rosuvastatin has the strongest chemopreventive effect.",

In elderly patients with carotid atherosclerosis and stenosis, it is not unusual for oral, head and neck cancer surgery to be performed. The present study describes a case of stroke that occurred during a neck dissection for the treatment of cervical lymph node metastasis of a left maxillary gingival carcinoma. The patient was an 84-year-old female who was considered to be at high risk of a stroke based on pre-operative head and neck computed tomography scans, which detected severe carotid atherosclerosis and stenosis. There was no possible stroke prophylaxis available during the performance of the neck dissection in the present case. However, if patients are evaluated to be high-risk pre-operatively, statin agents should be administered, the surgery should be carefully performed, adequate sedation should be maintained post-operatively and the patient should be followed up, aiming to achieve the early detection of a possible stroke.", 
    "119": "Background Few studies have directly compared stroke recurrence rates after stroke and transient ischemic attack, and the risk factors underlying early recurrence are poorly understood. We aimed to investigate risk factors for recurrent stroke after first stroke and transient ischemic attack in a population-based study. Methods The North Dublin Population Stroke Study applied multiple overlapping hot and cold pursuit methods, to ascertain hospital- and community-treated stroke and transient ischemic attack patients over a 12-month period. Inclusion criteria were: (1) Stroke-physician confirmed transient ischemic attack/ischemic stroke; (2) first-stroke/transient ischemic attack event within the ascertainment period. Patients were prospectively followed at 72\u2009h, 7, 28 and 90 days. Results A total of 584 patients met eligibility criteria (172 transient ischemic attack, 412 stroke). More transient ischemic attack than stroke patients presented to medical attention with recurrent stroke (8.24% vs. 0.24%, p\u2009=\u20090.0002). Recurrent stroke was more common after transient ischemic attack than index stroke at each time-interval (at 72\u2009h, 4.07% vs. 1.23%, p\u2009=\u20090.03; at 90 days, 13.45% vs. 5.72%, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Stroke recurrence at 90 days was also associated with delay seeking medical attention after the index event (OR 3.2, p\u2009=\u20090.001), delayed anti-platelet (OR 2.8, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and statin (OR 2.4, p\u2009=\u20090.009) treatment, carotid stenosis/occlusion (OR 2.4, p\u2009=\u20090.008). On multivariable analysis, transient ischemic attack as index event (adjusted OR 2.3, p\u2009=\u20090.02), delayed statin treatment (OR 2.5, p\u2009=\u20090.02), and carotid stenosis/occlusion (OR 2.4, p\u2009=\u20090.02) were independent predictors of 90-day recurrent stroke. Conclusion A combination of pathophysiological and behavioral factors was associated with early stroke recurrence risk. Improved public awareness to reduce delays to self-referral for transient ischemic attack symptoms is needed.",

    "123": "The consensus to analyse the lipid profile in CKD patients suggests acknowledgment of the high cardiovascular risk of this condition. However, the lack of consensus in considering renal function or albuminuria, both when selecting a statin and during follow-up, suggests a limited knowledge of the differences between statins in relation to CKD.

Statins have contributed significantly to noted declines in cardiovascular-related mortality in the last decade; however, the benefit of statins is inequitable across genders. Women continue to be less likely to take statins and to meet target LDL goals than men. As a possible contributing factor to this disparity, we explore the evidence for gender-based differences in provision of, and adherence to statins.", 
    "125": "Compared with men, women are less likely to adhere to statins. Potential reasons for this gender difference in use of statins can be observed across all phases of adherence including both intentional and unintentional non-adherence. Notable gender-specific contributing factors for statin non-adherence include decreased provider and patient awareness of CVD risk among women, higher risk of statin intolerance among women, and competing demands associated with family caregiving responsibilities. Similar to limitations in the broader CVD literature, there is inadequate inclusion of gender-specific analyses in statin-related trials. Gender-based disparities in statin adherence can be linked to both provider level, psychosocial, and medication intolerance factors. Interventions designed to improve statin adherence should take gender-specific challenges into consideration such as women being older at the time of increased CVD risk, higher rates of statin intolerance, and potentially greater caregiving responsibilities.", 
    "126": "In addition to cholesterol depletion, statins also significantly decrease systemic inflammation as measured by C-reactive protein. In this issue of American Journal of Gastroenterology, Ungaro et al. present their results on the associations between statin prescriptions and risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Using a national medical claims and pharmacy database created by Symphony Health Solutions LLC (SHA), they show that any use of statin is protective against diagnosis of CD and UC. The protective effect against CD appears strongest among older populations (>60 years old). These findings offer intriguing insights into inflammatory pathways that could be modulated by cholesterol lowering drugs. In addition, if replicated in other cohorts, these results provide further rationale for investigating the use of statins in broader preventive efforts, including healthy patients at risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease.", 
    "127": "Chronic neonatal pulmonary hypertension (PHT) frequently results in early death. Systemically administered Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitors prevent and reverse chronic PHT in neonatal rats, but at the cost of severe adverse effects, including systemic hypotension and growth restriction. Simvastatin has pleiotropic inhibitory effects on isoprenoid intermediates that may limit activity of RhoA, which signals upstream of ROCK. We therefore hypothesized that statin treatment would safely limit pulmonary vascular RhoA activity and prevent and reverse experimental chronic neonatal PHT via downstream inhibitory effects on pathological ROCK activity. Sprague-Dawley rats in normoxia (room air) or moderate normobaric hypoxia (13% O2) received simvastatin (2 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) ip) or vehicle from postnatal days 1-14 (prevention protocol) or from days 14-21 (rescue protocol). Chronic hypoxia increased RhoA and ROCK activity in lung tissue. Simvastatin reduced lung content of the isoprenoid intermediate farnesyl pyrophosphate and decreased RhoA/ROCK signaling in the hypoxia-exposed lung. Preventive or rescue treatment of chronic hypoxia-exposed animals with simvastatin decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary arterial remodeling. Preventive simvastatin treatment improved weight gain, did not lower systemic blood pressure, and did not cause apparent toxic effects on skeletal muscle, liver or brain. Rescue therapy with simvastatin improved exercise capacity. We conclude that simvastatin limits RhoA/ROCK activity in the chronic hypoxia-exposed lung, thus preventing or ameliorating hemodynamic and structural markers of chronic PHT and improving long-term outcome, without causing adverse effects.",

Therefore, whether statins are associated with congenital anomalies or other pregnancy complications remains an important clinical question.

We conducted a literature search to identify relevant English language studies related to statin exposure and pregnancy. Single case reports, animal studies, studies only published in abstract form, and non-English language studies were excluded. A total of 16 clinical studies were included in this systematic review. Although early uncontrolled case series reported congenital anomalies associated with statin use, more recent observational studies did not report an increased risk of congenital anomalies with statin exposure in pregnancy when compared to control groups or the prevalence of congenital anomalies in the general population. Our findings show no clear relationship of congenital anomalies with statin use in pregnancy, and our study supports the findings that statins are probably not teratogenic.

None of four studies using medication reminders and/or adherence feedback alone reported significantly improved statin adherence. Single interventions that improved statin adherence but were not conducted face-to-face included cognitive education in the form of genetic test results (two studies) and cognitive education via a website (one study). Similar mean adherence measures were reported for 17 intervention arms and were thus compared in a sub-analysis: 8 showed significantly improved statin adherence, but effect sizes were modest (+7 to +22\u00a0% points). In three of these studies, statin adherence improved despite already being high in the control group (82-89 vs. 57-69\u00a0% in the other studies). These three studies were the only studies in this sub-analysis to include cognitive education delivered face-to-face multiple times (plus other interventions).

Such knowledge is important for informed physician-patient decisions. A literature search was conducted for RCTs of statins in primary prevention that included >1000 general patients and clinical outcomes as a primary endpoint. A total of 11 RCTs were identified; target population baseline characteristics, outcomes measures, statistical methods, and limitations regarding follow-up were reported. RCTs of statins in primary prevention show consistent overall beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Caveats involve the characteristics of individual study populations since target populations often differ from what is currently considered primary prevention. Only middle aged and older populations were adequately represented in these RCTs; women were under-represented. Only one study included total mortality as the primary endpoint; all other RCTs used composite major adverse cardiac events as the primary endpoint, which occasionally included a hard outcome such as death and a soft outcome such as hospitalization for angina. The use of Cox proportional hazard analysis in RCTs poses some challenges, and intention-to-treat analysis may mask adverse events.

The objective of this study is to investigate the functional role of YAP/TAZ in the flow regulation of atheroprone endothelial phenotypes and the consequential development of atherosclerotic lesions. We found that exposure of cultured endothelial cells (ECs) to the atheroprone disturbed flow resulted in YAP/TAZ activation and translocation into EC nucleus to up-regulate the target genes, including cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and ankyrin repeat domain 1 (ANKRD1). In contrast, the athero-protective laminar flow suppressed YAP/TAZ activities. En face analysis of mouse arteries demonstrated an increased nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ and elevated levels of the target genes in the endothelium in atheroprone areas compared with athero-protective areas. YAP/TAZ knockdown significantly attenuated the disturbed flow induction of EC proliferative and proinflammatory phenotypes, whereas overexpression of constitutively active YAP was sufficient to promote EC proliferation and inflammation. In addition, treatment with statin, an antiatherosclerotic drug, inhibited YAP/TAZ activities to diminish the disturbed flow-induced proliferation and inflammation. In vivo blockade of YAP/TAZ translation by morpholino oligos significantly reduced endothelial inflammation and the size of atherosclerotic lesions. Our results demonstrate a critical role of the activation of YAP/TAZ by disturbed flow in promoting atheroprone phenotypes and atherosclerotic lesion development. Therefore, inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation is a promising athero-protective therapeutic strategy.",

In this retrospective observational study on 2,597 community-dwelling patients aged \u226565\u00a0years with a previous hospitalization for CAD, we estimated mortality risk assessed with the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), based on the Standardized Multidimensional Assessment Schedule for Adults and Aged Persons (SVaMA), used to determine accessibility to homecare services/nursing home admission in 2005 to 2013 in the Padua Health District, Veneto, Italy. Participants were categorized as having mild (MPI-SVaMA-1), moderate (MPI-SVaMA-2), and high (MPI-SVaMA-3) baseline mortality risk, and propensity score-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 3-year mortality rate were calculated according to statin treatment in these subgroups. Greater MPI-SVaMA scores were associated with lower rates of statin treatment and higher 3-year mortality rate (MPI-SVaMA-1\u00a0= 23.4%; MPI-SVaMA-2\u00a0= 39.1%; MPI-SVaMA-3\u00a0= 76.2%).

Baseline oxLDL level was 34.2\u2009\u00b1\u200913.8\u2009U/L in AURORA and did not differ between treatment groups, and 74.6\u2009\u00b1\u200928.1\u2009U/L in LURIC. Lower baseline oxLDL levels were associated with higher hazard ratios (HRs) for outcomes, but not anymore after adjusting for apolipoprotein B level in AURORA and was not related to mortality in LURIC. OxLDL levels decreased by 30.9% between baseline and 3 months in the statin-treated group and increased by 10.5% between 3 and 12 months. Nevertheless, oxLDL reduction was not significantly associated with adjusted HRs for MACE and for all-cause mortality. These results showed no association between oxLDL and MACE after adjustment on apolipoprotein B, which may relate to the properties of the method used for oxLDL. Our results also showed no benefit for oxLDL reduction by rosuvastatin on outcomes.

Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of evolocumab (140 mg/every 2 weeks or 420 mg/month, via subcutaneous injection) in monotherapy and in combination with statins, in the treatment of patients intolerant to statins or with FH. In monotherapy, it reduces LDL-C by 55%, and its association with statins leads to a reduction of LDL-C by up to 63%-75%. Evolocumab has been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing the long-term effects of evolocumab on the incidence of cardiovascular risk, safety, and tolerability.

The intervention is tailored to patients' individual health barriers and their level of health activation. We cluster-randomized 14 practice sites of a large multispecialty group practice to receive either the pharmacist-based intervention or usual care. STIC2IT has enrolled 4,076 patients who will be followed up for 12months after randomization. The trial's primary outcome is medication adherence, assessed using pharmacy claims data. Secondary outcomes are disease control and health care resource utilization.", 
    "274": "This trial will determine whether a technologically enabled, behaviorally targeted pharmacist-based intervention results in improved adherence and disease control. If effective, this strategy could be a scalable method of offering tailored adherence support to those with the greatest clinical need.", 
    "275": "There are limited data assessing statin therapy in patients with nonobstructive coronary plaque on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).", 
    "276": "Two hundred six consecutive patients with mild noncalcified plaque on CCTA were enrolled in this multicenter prospective observational study. Subjects were divided into 3 groups according to subsequent statin therapy: intensive statin therapy (n = 55), moderate statins (n = 85), and no statin (n = 66). Serial scans were performed after a median interval of 18 months. Low-attenuation plaque (LAP) volume, total plaque volume, and percent plaque volume were measured.", 
    "277": "The LAP volume, total plaque volume, and percent plaque volume showed significant regression among intensive-statin compared with no-statin group (annualized changes: -7.1 \u00b1 13.1 vs 0.9 \u00b1 12.7 mm(3), P< .001; -16.4 \u00b1 35.0 vs 12.3 \u00b1 32.4 mm(3), P< .001; and -6.2% \u00b1 11.8% vs 3.5% \u00b1 12.1%, P< .001, respectively). Progression of LAP volume, total plaque volume, and percent plaque volume was retarded among moderate-statin compared with no-statin group (annualized changes: -2.8 \u00b1 7.6 vs 0.9 \u00b1 12.7 mm(3), P= .041; -0.1 \u00b1 25.6 vs 12.3 \u00b1 32.4 mm(3), P= .014; and -1.8% \u00b1 11.2% vs 3.5% \u00b1 12.1%, P= .006, respectively). On multivariable model predicting change in total plaque volume, higher baseline LAP volume, moderate statin therapy, and intensive statin therapy were each independent predictors of plaque regression (standardized coefficients: baseline LAP volume -0.36, P< .001; moderate statin -0.21, P= .004; intensive statin -0.36, P< .001, respectively).", 
    "278": "This study suggests that statin treatment can retard progression and even induce regression of mild noncalcified coronary plaque. Patients with greater baseline LAP volume are more likely to benefit from statin therapy.", 
    "279": "Recently, genetic studies have suggested a causal relationship between cholesterol remnants and ischemic heart disease. We aimed to determine whether cholesterol remnants and its marker, triglyceride levels, are associated with cardiac function as determined by sensitive echocardiographic measures in a population of patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "280": "Comprehensive echocardiography including 2D-speckle tracking echocardiography was performed on a representative sample of 924 patients with type 2 diabetes-730 of whom were treated with statins. These were recruited from two large secondary care centers.", 
    "281": "In multivariable analyses, triglycerides and cholesterol remnants were not associated with left ventricular ejection fraction, but with subtle measures of systolic function, including global longitudinal strain by speckle tracking and longitudinal displacement by tissue Doppler echocardiography: global longitudinal strain [0.33\u00a0% (0.14), p\u00a0=\u00a00.02 per doubling in cholesterol remnants and 0.28\u00a0% (0.13), p\u00a0=\u00a00.03 per doubling in triglyceride levels] and with longitudinal displacement [-0.25\u00a0mm (0.10), p\u00a0=\u00a00.01 per doubling in cholesterol remnants and -0.25\u00a0mm (0.09), p\u00a0=\u00a00.005 per doubling in triglyceride levels]. Subgroup analyses of patients receiving statin therapy and patients without known heart disease revealed similar results, but the association was not present in patients with known heart disease.", 
    "282": "In patients with type 2 diabetes, subtle decrease in left ventricular function is present with increasing levels of cholesterol remnants and triglyceride levels indicating an effect of these on cardiac function that is not detectable by conventional echocardiography.", 
    "283": "Cardiac events are an important cause of postsurgical morbidity and mortality. Statin drugs have been studied as potentially risk-modifying agents in perioperative medicine. They have been shown to confer a protective benefit in cardiac surgery, but the evidence available in noncardiac surgery patient populations remains less conclusive. We hypothesized that perioperative statin treatment would be associated with lower incidence of postsurgical cardiac events (PSCEs) after major noncardiac surgery. A retrospective cohort study included 21,637 major noncardiac surgeries. Statin treatment was the exposure of interest and PSCE was the primary outcome measure. Data collection included patient age, body mass index, smoking status, diabetic status, cardiac event history, statin treatment history, and PSCE diagnoses. Perioperative statin treatment occurred in 4176 cases (19.3%). PSCEs occurred in 50 cases (0.23%), 29 in the untreated control group (0.17%) and 21 in the statin treatment group (0.50%). Relative risk in the untreated group was 0.3303 (95% confidence interval = 0.1886, 0.5786). This implied that statin-treated patients had higher risk than the untreated group. However, a logistic regression model that accounted for observed cardiac disease risk factors showed statin treatment not to be a significant predictor of PSCE in this sample. Analysis repeated in high-risk subsets of the cohort yielded similar results. A propensity score matching method that minimized differences between study groups also failed to demonstrate a significant association between statin treatment and PSCE risk. Our study did not demonstrate a significant association between perioperative statin treatment and PSCEs after major noncardiac surgery."
