    "1": "Hematoma expansion and evolution of perihematomal edema are most commonly responsible for neurological deterioration following ICH. A possible role of statins in reducing perihematomal edema has been suggested based on studies in animal models.", 
    "2": "Records of consecutive ICH patients admitted to The Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1999 to 2006 were reviewed. Patients with ICH related to trauma or underlying lesions (e.g., brain tumors, aneurysms, and arterio-venous malformations) and of infratentorial location were excluded. Absolute and relative perihematomal edema were assessed on initial head CT. Using regression analysis, the impact of prior statin use on absolute and relative edema at presentation was assessed correcting for other factors possibly impacting perihematomal edema, such as age, coagulopathy, aspirin use, admission mean arterial pressure (MAP), and blood glucose.", 
    "3": "A total of 125 consecutive ICH patients were studied. Patients with prior statin exposure had a mean edema volume of 13.2 +/- 9.2 cc compared to 22.3 +/- 18.3 cc in patients who were not using statins at the time of ICH. Following multiple linear regression analysis, we have identified a statistically significant association between prior statin use with reduced early absolute perihematomal edema (P = 0.035). Mean relative perihematomal edema was significantly lower in patients on statins at presentation (0.44) as opposed to 0.81 in patients with no prior statin use. This difference remained statistically significant (P = 0.021) after correcting for other variables.", 
    "4": "We report the association between statin use prior to ICH and decreased absolute and relative perihematomal edema. A prospective study analyzing the role of statins in perihematomal edema reduction and the resultant effect on mortality and functional outcomes following ICH is warranted.", 
    "5": "Statins are potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase and display anticancer activity, but their clinical use is limited by their high-dose toxicity. Similarly, gamma-tocotrienol, an isoform of vitamin E, also reduces HMGCoA reductase activity and displays potent anticancer activity. Studies were conducted to determine if combined low dose treatment of gamma-tocotrienol with individual statins resulted in a synergistic antiproliferative effect on neoplastic mouse +SA mammary epithelial cells. Treatment with 3-4 microM gamma-tocotrienol or 2-8 microM simvastatin, lovastatin or mevastatin alone resulted in a significant decrease, whereas treatment with 10-100 microM pravastatin had no effect on +SA cell growth. However, combined treatment of subeffective doses (0.25 or 10 microM) of individual statins with 0.25-2.0 microM gamma-tocotrienol resulted in a dose-responsive synergistic inhibition in +SA cell proliferation. Additional studies showed that treatment with subeffective doses of individual statins or gamma-tocotrienol alone had no effect, whereas combined treatment of these compounds resulted in a relatively large decrease in intracellular levels of phosphorylated (activated) MAPK, JNK, p38, and Akt. These findings strongly suggest that combined low dose treatment of gamma-tocotrienol with individual statins may have potential value in the treatment of breast cancer without causing myotoxicity that is associated with high dose statin treatment.", 
    "6": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common postoperative arrhythmia with significant consequences on patient health. Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) complicates up to 8% of all noncardiac surgeries, between 3% and 30% of noncardiac thoracic surgeries, and between 16% and 46% of cardiac surgeries. POAF has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and longer, more costly hospital stays. The risk of POAF after cardiac and noncardiac surgery may be affected by several epidemiologic and intraoperative factors, as well as by the presence of preexisting cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. POAF is typically a transient, reversible phenomenon that may develop in patients who possess an electrophysiologic substrate for the arrhythmia that is present before or as a result of surgery. Numerous studies support the efficacy of beta-blockers in POAF prevention; they are currently the most common medication used in POAF prophylaxis. Perioperative amiodarone, sotalol, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and magnesium sulfate have been associated with a reduction in the occurrence of POAF. Biatrial pacing is a nonpharmacologic method that has been associated with a reduced risk of POAF. Additionally, recent studies have demonstrated that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors may decrease the risk of POAF. Finally, based on recent evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers reduce the risk of permanent atrial fibrillation, these medications may also hold promise in POAF prophylaxis. However, there is a need for further large-scale investigations that incorporate standard methodologies and diagnostic criteria, which have been lacking in past trials.", 
    "7": "Statin use is associated with a variety of overtly related muscle symptoms including muscle pain, myalgia, creatine kinase elevations without pain with myolysis and myositis (rhabdomyolysis), a potentially fatal side effect that led to the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001. Unintended drug response phenotypes have an impact on patient compliance and sometimes patient health and the assessment of risk on an individual basis could enhance therapeutic benefit. We therefore investigated whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with the expression of broadly grouped atorvastatin-induced muscle events in a case-control study (n=263 samples, n=388 SNPs). Of a number of associations identified in a discovery sample (51 atorvastatin-induced muscle and 55 normal) only those corresponding to the CYP2D6*4 allele were significantly associated in the sample (24 atorvastatin-induced muscle and 133 normal) (Discovery P=0.004, odds ratio=3.6; Validation P=0.036, odds ratio=2.7; total P=0.001, odds ratio=2.5). The frequency of the CYP2D6*4 allele was about 50% in atorvastatin-induced muscle patients but only 28% in controls, similar to that of other patient types (28.5%). The association was independent of various demographic variables and not explained by gross demographic, clinical or population-structure differences among cases and controls. Surprisingly, the CYP2D6*4 allele appeared similarly distributed among controls and patients expressing simvastatin-induced muscle events (n=169, frequency in case participants=49.2%, P=0.067, odds ratio=1.7). Our results suggest that the CYP2D6*4 allele is associated with broadly related muscle events caused by at least two structurally dissimilar HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and as such, may have implications for a better understanding of this statin-wide phenomena.", 
    "8": "The postprandial state is critical in atherogenesis. The aims of this study were to study the postprandial change of plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events, and to explore the influence of fluvastatin on hsCRP concentration.", 
    "9": "Forty-three patients at high risk for cardiovascular events and 15 healthy controls participated in this study. All participants received an oral high-fat meal (800 calories; 50 g fat) at baseline. Blood samples were drawn at 0 and 4 h to measure the plasma concentrations of triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hsCRP. Then patients at high risk were randomly divided into two groups to accept fluvastatin (40 mg/day) (fluvastatin group, n=22) or placebo (placebo group, n=21). One week later, the high-fat meals were repeated and plasma samples were collected again.", 
    "10": "The postprandial plasma triglyceride concentrations increased in all participants, whereas the postprandial plasma hsCRP concentrations increased significantly only in patients at high risk (P<0.05), but not in healthy controls. After 1 week, the fasting or postprandial plasma lipid levels and hsCRP concentrations did not significantly change in the placebo group compared with the levels at baseline, whereas the postprandial plasma triglyceride and hsCRP concentrations significantly decreased in the fluvastatin group. The reduction of plasma hsCRP concentration was not related to the change of plasma triglyceride concentration.", 
    "11": "Fluvastatin effectively reduced postprandial plasma hsCRP concentrations in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events in a very short period of time.", 
    "12": "As of today, the effect of statins on non-cardiovascular mortality is still being debated. Single studies have not been able to provide definite answers. We performed a meta-regression analysis on randomized statin trials in order to provide evidence that non-cardiovascular mortality is related to statin treatment and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plasma level.", 
    "13": "We selected 29 randomized controlled trials of statins versus placebo, a total of 90,480 patients, with a follow-up of >12 months. Baseline and follow-up LDL levels and all-cause, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality were recorded. Weighted linear regression analysis was carried out separately for placebo and treatment groups.", 
    "14": "LDL level was inversely related to overall mortality (p = 0.0105) and non-cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.0171) in the treatment group. By contrast, in the placebo group only non-cardiovascular mortality was inversely correlated to LDL (p = 0.0032). The regression lines have similar slopes and run almost parallel to each other, with the treatment line lying below the placebo line. To identify the threshold of risk for starting statin therapy, we analysed the relationship between baseline cardiovascular risk and overall mortality in the two groups. Both correlations are highly significant and regression lines intersect at a risk of 0.29% per year. This implies that the effects of statins are favourable when the baseline cardiovascular risk exceeds approximately 3% in 10 years.", 
    "15": "A trend of increased non-cardiovascular mortality with decreased LDL exists both in placebo and treatment groups. However, at each given LDL cholesterol level, non-cardiovascular mortality is lower in treated patients. Therefore, statin therapy may improve the biological impact of LDL on non-cardiovascular mortality.", 
    "16": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are characterized by impaired erectile function and overactivity of the procontractile RhoA/Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (RhoA/ROCK) pathway, as compared with their normotensive counterpart, Wistar-Kyoto rats. By measuring the intracavernous pressure:mean arterial pressure (ICP:MAP) ratio after electrostimulation of the cavernous nerve, we confirmed these findings and showed that responsiveness to sildenafil (25 mg/kg by oral gavage) also is hampered in SHR. A 2-week treatment with atorvastatin (5 and 30 mg/kg) improved the sildenafil-induced ICP:MAP increase and normalized RhoA and ROCK2 overexpression in SHR corpora cavernosa (CC). Conversely, other genes, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS), endothelial NOS, and phosphodiesterase 5, were unaffected. In human fetal smooth muscle cells derived from CC (hfPSMC), atorvastatin inhibited RhoA membrane translocation and ROCK activity, as well as RhoA-dependent biologic functions like cell migration and cell proliferation. Atorvastatin's effect on migration was rescued in a dose-dependent manner by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, suggesting the involvement of RhoA geranylgeranylation. In hfPSMC, atorvastatin decreased the expression of RhoA-dependent genes such as ROCK2, desmin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, SM22alpha, and myocardin. In contrast to atorvastatin, elocalcitol, a vitamin D analog that also interferes with RhoA activation in SHR bladder, was unable to restore penile responsiveness to sildenafil. In conclusion, atorvastatin, but not elocalcitol, ameliorates sildenafil-induced penile erections in SHR, likely by interfering with RhoA/ROCK signaling within the penis.", 
    "17": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the mortality rate in stage 5 CKD is even higher in patients with diabetes. CVD risk reduction includes control of hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and BP. An LDL cholesterol goal of 70 mg/dl has been suggested for such high-risk patients. Most studies that have showed CVD risk reduction with statins have been in patients without CKD. However, some studies have had sufficient numbers of patients with CKD stages 2 to 3 to permit analysis, and these generally have shown CVD benefits similar to those found in patients without CKD. Studies that have shown benefit in patients who were on dialysis or after transplantation have been mixed, in part because CVD in such patients is far advanced and may not respond as well to intervention. As GFR falls, the dosages of many of the drugs that are used for the treatment of dyslipidemias need to be modified. In general, however, atorvastatin and fluvastatin dosages do not have to be modified. Drug interactions with cyclosporine also occur. In general, combinations of statins and fibrates should be avoided, and fenofibrate should be avoided in all patients with decreased GFR levels. Overall, on the basis of the very high risk for CVD in patients with diabetes and CKD, aggressive management of dyslipidemias is warranted, with an LDL goal of 70 mg/dl.", 
    "18": "Lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis, can readily induce apoptosis in a subset of human tumor types including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). We recently identified activation of transcription factor (ATF) 4 as a lovastatin induced gene in HNSCC cells. ATF4 plays a significant role in regulating cellular responses to a wide variety of stress inducers known as the integrated stress response (ISR). These cell stresses lead to the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2alpha shutting down global protein translation. However, the translation of ATF4 is enhanced. In this study, lovastatin treatment induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation and inhibited global protein translation. ATF4 expression was induced followed by increased ATF3 and CHOP expression, targets of ATF4 activity, in SCC25 HNSCC cells. In CHOP(-/-) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), lovastatin-induced apoptosis was attenuated indicating a role for CHOP in this response. Furthermore, the eIF2alpha kinase GCN2 mediates lovastatin induction of ATF4 and lovastatin-induced apoptosis was also attenuated in GCN2(-/-) MEFs. The pro-drug version of lovastatin has potential proteasome inhibitory activity and recently a variety of well established proteasome inhibitors were shown to activate the ISR. In this study, neither the pro-drug nor the active forms of lovastatin had any significant effect on proteasome activity. Therefore, lovastatin, by targeting mevalonate synthesis, is a potent inducer of the ISR through a novel and as yet unrecognized mechanism.",

    "25": "The trial was conducted at 4 academic institutions within North America. Patients Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive MS who were not taking any other disease-modifying drugs were enrolled in the trial.

    "30": "Fermentation products of Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 (a parent strain for lovastatin production) were collected, and the coexistence of itaconic acid (IA) with lovastatin was confirmed in this study. Using a lactose-based medium (LBM), lovastatin production was 873 mg/l on day 10, but IA production was only 22-28 mg/l during the cultures. When lactose in LBM was simply replaced with glucose, IA production was markedly enhanced by 20-fold (491 mg/l on day 5), which showed a growth-associated pattern. The findings indicated that the carbon source used (glucose or lactose) controlled the biosynthetic pathway. The net yield of lovastatin production when using lactose was calculated to be 25.1 mg/g (5.1-fold) in comparison with when using glucose in the cultures. Furthermore, lovastatin production was further increased by 9.2% when IA (0.5 g/l) was added to LBM. When IA was added at 5 g/l, the fermentation broth turned dark-brown, and lovastatin production was reduced by 18.0%. Hence, these two metabolites (IA and lovastatin) produced by the fungus might be related.",

We also included all studies from the previously published meta-analysis. Using the same analytic approach as previously, we determined the effects of net absolute reductions (1 mmol/L [38.7 mg/dL]) in TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on the relative risks (RRs) for all-cause mortality, CHD-related mortality, any CHD event (mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction), and non-CHD-related mortality.",

Corresponding reductions for every 1-mmol/L decrease in LDL-C were 15.6%, 28.0%, and 26.6%, respectively. Similar relationships were observed in patients without CHD. No significant relationship was found between lipid reduction and non-CHD-related mortality risk.",

This study compared the efficacy of tesaglitazar with that of pioglitazone as adjunctive therapy to atorvastatin in subjects with abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia. In this open-label, 3-way crossover study, 58 subjects received atorvastatin 10 mg once daily in a 6-week run-in period, followed by tesaglitazar 3 mg, pioglitazone 45 mg, or placebo, as adjunctive therapy to atorvastatin, in a randomized sequence for 6 weeks each. Serum triglycerides and other lipids, apolipoproteins, glucose, and insulin concentrations were compared between treatments. Tesaglitazar adjunctive therapy reduced serum triglycerides significantly more from baseline (-1.07 mmol/L) than pioglitazone (-0.33 mmol/L; P = .007) or placebo (-0.09 mmol/L; P < .0001). Tesaglitazar also resulted in significantly greater improvements in free fatty acids, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, low-density lipoprotein particle size, apolipoprotein (apo) B, apo C-III, and the apo B/apo A-I ratio compared with pioglitazone or placebo. Tesaglitazar adjunctive therapy also reduced fasting plasma glucose, fasting plasma insulin, and insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment index) significantly more than pioglitazone or placebo (P < .0001 for all comparisons). Tesaglitazar was generally well tolerated in combination with atorvastatin, but hemoglobin and absolute neutrophil count decreased and serum creatinine increased more with tesaglitazar than with pioglitazone or placebo. These effects, also shown in previous trials, led to the discontinuation of the clinical development of the drug. In conclusion, the addition of tesaglitazar to a background of atorvastatin therapy further improved the dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance.", 
    "42": "Insulin resistance (IR) and other proatherogenic risk factors associated with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are improved by renal transplantation. Adiponectin is a protein with insulin-sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic properties. It exists in several isoforms, but the high molecular weight (HMW) isoform correlates best with insulin sensitivity. Paradoxically, the levels of this protein and its HMW isoform are increased in ESKD. We measured the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), plasma adiponectin and its isoforms, and messenger RNA for adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 54 stable transplant recipients, 50 patients established on hemodialysis, and 52 controls; groups were matched for body mass index and sex. HOMA-IR values were significantly higher in patients with ESKD compared with controls (P < .0005) and transplant patients (P < .05) but there was no difference between the latter 2 groups. Adiponectin levels were also higher in patients with ESKD compared with controls (P < .0005), and although levels were lower in the transplant group, they remained higher than in controls (P < .0001). However, although the absolute amount of HMW isoform in transplant patients remained higher than in controls (P < .0001), the proportion was similar, and less than in patients with ESKD (P < .005). The absolute amount of the HMW isoform correlated with superior metabolic indices in all 3 cohorts. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 messenger RNA levels after transplantation were significantly lower than those of ESKD subjects (P < .0001, P < .01), but transplant patients had less AdipoR1 than controls, although their AdipoR2 levels were higher. AdipoR1 correlated with AdipoR2 in all 3 cohorts. We conclude that HOMA-IR was lower in the transplant group compared with the group on hemodialysis and this coincided with lower total adiponectin levels and absolute amount of the HMW isoform and AdipoR on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Lower AdipoR after transplantation may be secondary to immunosuppression and/or an improvement in glomerular filtration rate and the uremic milieu.", 
    "43": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical and angiographic factors associated with significant saphenous vein graft (SVG) atherosclerosis progression at mid-term follow-up in a series of unselected coronary patients who had previously received a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). A total of 123 SVGs from 86 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization twice, 15 +/- 12 months apart, were included in the study. None of the SVGs presented any > or =50% diameter stenosis (DS) lesion or underwent any intervention at baseline. All SVGs were divided into 3 segments and each SVG segment was scored from 0 to 3 depending on the presence of lesions, with percent DS ranging from 0% to 19% (score 0), 20% to 29% (score 1), 30% to 39% (score 2), and > or =40% (score 3). The SVG atherosclerotic burden score (ABS) was calculated by adding the score obtained for each of the 3 SVG segments. Significant progression was defined as > or =10% increase in lesion percent DS or > or =0.6 mm decrease in minimal lumen diameter between baseline and follow-up studies. Mean age of the study population was 66 +/- 9 years, and most of the patients were receiving statin therapy with mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 85 +/- 26 mg/dl. Significant angiographic progression occurred in > or =1 SVG in 41 patients (48%). On multivariate analysis, the variables associated with SVG atherosclerosis progression were SVG ABS (odds ratio [OR], 1.52 for each increase of 1 point in SVG ABS; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.29) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (OR 1.38 for each decrease of 5 mg/dl in HDL cholesterol levels, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.85). Twenty-two patients (26%) had a cardiac event at follow-up related to SVG disease progression. The percent DS of the SVG segment at baseline was associated with SVG disease progression leading to a cardiac event (OR 3.67 for each increase of 5% in percent DS, 95% CI 2.11 to 6.38). In conclusion, simple clinical and angiographic variables such as HDL cholesterol, ABS, and lesion severity remain independent predictors of significant SVG atherosclerosis progression in mild to moderately diseased SVGs despite mean low-density lipoprotein levels <90 mg/dl.",

The elucidation of this molecular structure by means of (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy, HPLC/MS, MS/MS and FT-IR was shown. The mentioned by-product, originated during Merck Sharp and Dhome synthesis scheme was isolated in the second-last step replacing butylamine with benzylamine. The spectroscopic results agreed with a molecular formula C(32)H(43)NO(3).

    "45": "The lipid-lowering and anti-atherosclerotic effects of atorvastatin (10 mg/day) were investigated by measuring changes in the levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), serum lipids (total cholesterol [TC], LDL-cholesterol [LDL-C] and triglycerides [TG]), and in the protein adiponectin. This was undertaken in 22 patients with ischaemic heart disease and serum LDL-C levels > 100 mg/dl. After 3 months of therapy, atorvastatin significantly decreased serum lipids, oxidized LDL was reduced from 457.0 +/- 148.6 to 286.9 +/- 88.5 nmol/l, and adiponectin increased from 9.7 +/- 7.4 to 13.9 +/- 9.98 microg/ml. No significant correlation was observed between adiponectin and LDL-C, TG and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Atorvastatin therapy was not associated with side-effects, such as myalgia and gastrointestinal disorders, and did not give abnormal laboratory test results. It is concluded that atorvastatin decreases serum lipid and oxidized LDL levels, and increases adiponectin levels in patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "46": "We investigated whether simvastatin reduces lung injury caused by ischaemia-reperfusion of the hind limbs in rats. The control group underwent dissection of bilateral femoral arteries; another group (I/R group) underwent ischaemia of bilateral hind limbs for 2 h followed by 3 h reperfusion; and two other groups were pretreated with 5 or 10 mg/kg per day simvastatin for 3 days and then underwent ischaemia-reperfusion. The control and I/R group rats received placebo (water) instead of simvastatin. The lungs of the I/R rats showed marked histopathological changes compared with the other groups. Lung tissue myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, neutrophil count and lung injury scores in both simvastatin groups were significantly lower than in the I/R group; 10 mg/kg per day simvastatin significantly reduced lung water content although 5 mg/kg per day did not. Expression of haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein in lung tissue was significantly greater in the simvastatin groups than in the I/R group. Simvastatin protects against lung injury associated with lower extremity ischaemia-reperfusion by reduction of neutrophil aggregation and oxidative damage, and upregulation of HO-1 expression in the injured lung.",

Golden hamsters were fed a high-fat diet which resulted in insulin resistance. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (30 mg/kg). Normal golden hamsters were used as controls. Peritoneal macrophages were incubated with apolipoprotein A-1 (apoA-1), 8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-br-cAMP), and atorvastatin in vitro. Intracellular cholesterol accumulation was greater in the diabetic animals than in the insulin-resistant animals. Expression of ABCA1 mRNA in macrophages from diabetic animals was upregulated by 8-br-cAMP and atorvastatin. ApoA-1 caused a time-dependent cellular cholesterol efflux. Both atorvastatin and 8-br-cAMP significantly facilitated ABCA1-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux, with the maximal cholesterol efflux rate observed in the macrophages from diabetic animals. Accumulation of cholesterol in the macrophages of diabetic animals can be significantly alleviated by atorvastatin or 8-br-cAMP through improving ABCA1-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux.", 
    "48": "Patients with type 2 diabetes have a marked increase in the risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). One of the underlying reasons for this increased risk is atherogenic dyslipidaemia, which is common in this patient group and characterized by low plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), increased levels of serum triglycerides, specifically very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides, and an increase in small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Current management strategies focus on the initial use of statin or fibrate therapy (the latter approach indicated in patients with pronounced hypertriglyceridaemia). Recent treatment guidelines also emphasize the need for reduction in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) below 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) in diabetic patients, as this patient group has a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors that collectively lead to an excess risk of premature mortality. Multidrug lipid-modifying therapy has been proposed to further reduce CHD risk in diabetic patients. Adding nicotinic acid to primary statin therapy would be a logical approach based on the complementary therapeutic benefits of these treatments. Nicotinic acid is the most potent agent currently available for raising HDL-C and is also effective in reducing triglycerides and LDL-C. Moreover, clinical trial data have shown that nicotinic acid can be safely used in diabetic patients. Data from the Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol (ARBITER 2) study in patients with established CHD and low HDL-C (27% of whom had type 2 diabetes) show the atheroprotective effects of nicotinic acid/statin combination therapy. The clinical benefits of this combination therapy are indicated by subgroup analyses from the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study, which showed 40% reduction in coronary event frequency in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Together, these data support the proposed strategy of aggressive multidrug treatment of diabetic dyslipidaemia to improve patient outcome.", 
    "49": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), despite its adaptive nature, is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Achievement of LVH regression is thus considered a principal therapeutic aim. However, regression of LVH induced by various therapeutic means may exhibit differing patterns, with variable biological implications. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins) have been shown to induce prevention or regression of LVH in different models of pathological myocardial growth. In addition to reduction of LV mass, statins were shown to reduce myocardial fibrosis, increase capillary density network and attenuate electrical instability of the hypertrophied heart. Most importantly, statins improved systolic and diastolic LV function and even decreased mortality. The inhibition of hypertrophic growth was only partly achieved by reduction of haemodynamic overload. Direct mechanisms, such as inhibition of neurohumoral activation in the myocardial tissue, attenuated production of growth factors and markers of inflammation and reduction of oxidative stress also seem to participate. The protective effect of statins was associated with the inhibition of expression and activation of small guanosintriphosphate-binding proteins such as Ras and Rho, which control the intensity of oxidative stress, the production and availability of nitric oxide, and the expression of genes involved in myocardial growth. In addition to reduction of LV mass, statins may also improve the prognosis of LVH independently of their lipid-lowering effect.", 
    "50": "Using a patient targeted survey, we sought to assess patient representations of how physicians responded when patients presented with possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs). As a demonstration case, we took one widely prescribed drug class, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins'). This information was used to assess whether a patient-targeted ADR surveillance approach may complement provider reporting, potentially fostering identification of additional patients with possible or probable ADRs.", 
    "51": "A total of 650 adult patients taking statins with self-reported ADRs completed a survey. Depending on the problems reported, some patients completed additional surveys specific to the most commonly cited statin ADRs: muscle, cognitive or neuropathy related. Patients were asked to report drug, dose, ADR character, time course of onset with drug, recovery with discontinuation, recurrence with rechallenge, quality-of-life impact, and interactions with their physician in relation to the perceived ADR. This paper focuses on patients' representation of the doctor-patient interaction and physicians' attribution, when patients report perceived ADRs.", 
    "52": "Eighty-seven percent of patients reportedly spoke to their physician about the possible connection between statin use and their symptom. Patients reported that they and not the doctor most commonly initiated the discussion regarding the possible connection of drug to symptom (98% vs 2% cognition survey, 96% vs 4% neuropathy survey, 86% vs 14% muscle survey; p < 10(-8) for each). Physicians were reportedly more likely to deny than affirm the possibility of a connection. Rejection of a possible connection was reported to occur even for symptoms with strong literature support for a drug connection, and even in patients for whom the symptom met presumptive literature-based criteria for probable or definite drug-adverse effect causality. Assuming that physicians would not likely report ADRs in these instances, these patient-submitted ADR reports suggest that targeting patients may boost the yield of ADR reporting systems.",

    "56": "For people at very low risk of CHD, 429,299 CHD events could be prevented by the availability of OTC statins and 560,243 CHD events could be prevented among this group by implementing lifestyle interventions. For those at moderate risk of CHD, 244,388 CHD events could be prevented by OTC statins compared with 318 866 by lifestyle interventions. For people at high risk of CHD, prescription statins could prevent 374,897 CHD events over the next 5 years.",

Recently, neuroendovascular therapeutic procedures for athrosclerosis disease is increasing. We report a case of CCE after carotid stenting (CAS). A 73-year-old man with asymptomatic carotid stenosis was treated by percutanenous transluminal angioplasty with stenting. CAS was achieved in a short time without trouble. About 1 month after CAS, his renal function deteriorated and purpura appeared on both toe tips (blue toe syndrome) with muscle pain of the lower extremities. Under diagnosis of CCE, he was treated by Predonisolone 20 mg/day and Valsartan 160 mg/day, Pravastatin 10 mg/day. His symptom's dramatically improved, with partial recovery of renal function. CCE rarely occurs after angiographic or interventional procedures, but is difficult to diagnose clinically and there is no established therapy. For early diagnosis of CCE strict follow-up of a patients clinical presentation and laboratory data, especially in high risk patients, is needed.",

Due to their multi-functional characteristics and bioadaptability, cyclodextrins (CDs) are capable of forming inclusion complexes with many drugs by including a whole drug molecule inside their cavity. In the present study, we prepared SVA/CD inclusion complex solutions with different pH values. These were then used to determine their SVA release behavior after coating on titanium substrates, as well as to clarify the characteristics of SVA/CD complexes per se. Results showed that the lower the pH value of the solution, the lower the release kinetics of SVA. Besides, the amount of crystalline complexes in the coatings increased with decrease in pH. These results suggested that the release rate of SVA depended on two factors: pH of the solution and concomitant crystallinity of the coating.", 
    "60": "Chronic heart failure (HF) represents an emerging epidemic since its prevalence is continuously increasing despite advances in treatment. Many recent clinical studies have clearly demonstrated that statin therapy is associated with improved outcomes in HF irrespective of aetiology (ischaemic or not) or baseline cholesterol levels. Indeed, most of the conducted large statin trials and trials in HF have demonstrated a positive effect of statins in HF patients. Furthermore, the use of statins in HF seems to be safe as none of the recent trials has resulted in worse outcomes for HF patients treated with statins. Potential mechanisms through which statins could benefit the failing myocardium include non-sterol effects of statins, as well as effects on nitric oxide and endothelial function, inflammation and adhesion molecules, apoptosis and myocardial remodelling and neurohormonal activation. This review discusses the pathophysiological basis of statin effects on HF and focuses on clinical data for the benefit from statin use in this setting. Until today there are no official recommendations in both the American and the European guidelines regarding the use of statins in HF patients, as the available data come from small observational or larger but retrospective, non-randomised studies. Therefore, HF patients should be treated according to current lipid guidelines. Large randomised clinical trials are underway and will further delineate the role of statin therapy in HF patients. Until more data are available, we could not recommend statin use to every patient with HF irrespective of HF aetiology and baseline cholesterol levels.",

Although reperfusion is essential for salvaging ischemic myocardium, it also promotes infarction by activating programmed cell death in the formerly ischemic tissue. Reperfusion injury begins when oxidative stress and calcium accumulation by the mitochondria cause activation of the so-called mitochondrial death channels. These channels have become the focus of evolving strategies to protect the heart from infarction. Preclinical and preliminary clinical studies indicate that agents with diverse modes of action can reduce infarct size by 50% or more and significantly preserve myocardial functions. This article reviews the most advanced pharmacological approaches for their ability to reduce infarct size by inhibiting the mitochondrial death pathways.", 
    "68": "Human preadipocytes and adipocytes are known to produce the proatherogenic factor PAI-1 and proinflammatory cytokines, and obesity was found to be state of increased adipose production of these factors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of rosuvastatin on the regulation of PAI-1 gene expression in human adipocytes. Human preadipocytes, adipocytes in primary culture and the SGBS cell line were used as cell models. Cells were transfected using various constructs and promoter activity was measured as luciferase activity. PAI-1 expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA. Rosuvastatin inhibited PAI-1 mRNA expression and secretion of the protein in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was reversed by isoprenoids. Addition of MEK-inhibitors and NFkappaB inhibitors also reduced PAI-1 expression and PAI-1 promoter luciferase activity. Further experiments revealed that rosuvastatin down-regulated the MEKK-1 mediated activation of the PAI-1 promoter. In conclusion our data suggest that rosuvastatin inhibits PAI-1 expression and release from human adipocytes via a MEKK-1-dependent but not a NFkappaB-dependent mechanism.",

However, the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio changed significantly and favourably in all groups. The fall in fasting triglyceride levels in all groups was greater (reaching 19-25%) when baseline levels were > or = 1.5 or 1.7 mmol/L (136-150 mg/dL). There were no marked abnormalities in liver function tests or creatine kinase activity. In Group 3 there was a significant trend for a fall in serum creatinine levels across the tertiles of baseline creatinine values.

NAFLD is a clinicopathologic syndrome ranging from simple steatosis, which is relatively benign, to the more severe form known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is associated with significant liver related morbidity and mortality, and its underlying pathophysiology is thought to result from a multiple hit process. The initial insult is the accumulation of hepatic fat secondary to insulin resistance. In the setting of hepatic steatosis, the second hit can be caused by reactive oxygen species, inflammatory cytokines, and adipokines. Several therapeutic modalities that target these mechanisms are under investigation, but no proven treatment has yet emerged. Insulin sensitizers such as thiazolidinediones and metformin show promise, and several studies have explored the role of lipid lowering agents, antioxidants, and cytoprotective agents. Novel agents such as anti-obesity drugs, selective cannabinoid-1 receptor blockers, and dual PPAR alpha and gamma agonists are also under investigation. Unfortunately, data on the long-term safety and efficacy of these agents and their impact on liver related histologic outcomes are currently lacking. NAFLD treatment currently focuses on reducing metabolic risk factors, with the mainstay of therapy focusing on life-style modifications such as gradual weight loss through diet and regular exercise.",

Patients with ATC have a poor prognosis with a mean survival time of 2-6 months; surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy do not improve survival. Gene therapy approaches and oncolytic viruses have been tested for the treatment of ATC. To enhance the antineoplastic effects of the oncolytic adenovirus dl1520 (Onyx-015), we treated ATC cells with lovastatin (3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor), a drug used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, which has previously been reported to exert growth-inhibitory and apoptotic activity on ATC cells. Lovastatin treatment significantly increased the effects of dl1520 against ATC cells. The replication of dl1520 in ATC cells was enhanced by lovastatin treatment, and a significant increase of the expression of the early gene E1A 13 S and the late gene Penton was observed in lovastatin-treated cells. Furthermore, lovastatin treatment significantly enhanced the effects of dl1520 against ATC tumor xenografts. Lovastatin treatment could be exploited to increase the efficacy of oncolytic adenoviruses, and further studies are warranted to confirm the feasibility of the approach in ATC patients.",

A. terreus is a lovastatin producer but the formation of lovastatin was accompanied by the significant amounts of (+)-geodin, when the elevated concentration of carbon source (lactose) was still present in the medium in the idiophase and nitrogen source (yeast extract) was deficient. It was observed for runs, in which the higher (above 20 g l(-1)) initial lactose concentration was applied or when the nitrogen deficiency led to the decrease of biomass content in the system. In contrast to lovastatin, there was not optimum initial concentration of yeast extract, as its lowest tested initial concentration (2 g l(-1)) led to the highest (+)-geodin volumetric formation rates and final yield. What is more, even higher final (+)-geodin concentrations were achieved at elevated initial lactose concentration (40 g l(-1)) and in the lactose-fed fed-batch run. In the fed-batch run lovastatin concentration increased significantly too, as this metabolite formation is also carbon source dependent. Finally, (+)-geodin occurred to be a metabolite, whose formation, in contrast to lovastatin, is non-growth associated.",

We investigated the relationships among serum lipid levels, Apo E alleles and genotypes, and stroke risk factors in 216 stroke patients and 282 age- and sex-matched controls. Fasting blood samples were collected for total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride level determination and for genomic DNA extraction. Apo was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (Cfo I) analysis. Increasing levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides were associated with elevated stroke risk and was more pronounced in Apo E4-carrying subjects than in E3- and/or E2-carrying subjects. Apo 3 was significantly lower (0.546 vs 0.736; P < .001), whereas Apo 4 was higher in the stroke patients (0.370 vs 0.181; P < .001); Apo 2 was present at low but comparable frequencies. The prevalence of E3/E3 was lower and that of E4-containing phenotypes (E3/E4 and homozygous E4/E4) was higher in the stroke patients. The prevalence of the E4-containing phenotypes were significantly higher in ischemic versus hemorrhagic (P < .001) and in small-vessel versus large-vessel stroke cases (P < .001), and was associated with increased need for statin drugs (P = .040). Logistic regression models, after adjusting for potentially confounding variables including lipid profile, age, and sex, showed an significant association of apo 4 genotype with risk of stroke (P = .033).

The purpose of this study is to prove the safety, effectiveness and durability of reoperation in long term follow up of 18 years in a community hospital setting. From March 1988 to April 2005 80 patients, 46 men and 34 women (mean age: 64.1 years) underwent a total of 83 operations. Symptomatic recurrent stenosis (>70%) was the indication in 32, asymptomatic high-grade stenosis (>80%) in 49, intimal flap in one and fibromuscular dysplasia (F.M.D), in one. The initial operation was carotid endarterectomy with primary closure in 60 and prosthetic patch in 23. The mean recurrences were at 23.3 months in 33 with myointimal hyperplasia, 105.4 months in 29 with recurrent atherosclerosis, 61.4 months in 19 with both hyperplasia and atherosclerosis, 2 months in one with intimal flap and 8 months in one with F.M.D bands. Reoperation utilized primary closure (3), vein patch (14), prosthetic patch (55), Gore-Tex interposition grafts (7), vein interposition grafts (3) and intraoperative dilation (1). No perioperative strokes or deaths occurred. One patient died from cardiac complications following combined rCEA and coronary artery bypass grafting. Operative morbidity consisted of reversible nerve injury (5), irreversible recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (1) and hematoma requiring evacuation (3). During follow up (3-153 months; mean: 50.9) carotid occlusion resulted in mild ipsilateral stroke in one patient, and one non-hemispheric stroke. There were 26 late deaths due to all causes, one due to CVA. Eight patients required reoperation (mean 53.4 months). Seven of these were hypertensive. Kaplan-Meier analysis of long-term follow up shows relatively high stroke free rates; at 153 months (12.75 years) the hemispheric stroke free rate was 98.67% and the all-stroke free rate was 95.85%. The survival estimate following redo surgery was 69.97% at 5 years and 40.23% at 10 years. We found that individuals on statin therapy (p-value=0.0042), and those on combination of statin and aspirin (p-value=0.0320), had significantly increased interval between primary and secondary operation. Increased age was correlated to a decreased time to redo surgery (p-value=<0.0001). We conclude that reoperation for recurrent carotid stenosis using standard vascular techniques is safe, effective, durable and cost effective. It should continue to be the mainstay of treatment when secondary intervention is required. Statins have a salutary effect on durability of the procedure and should be used when indicated.",

Multivariate analysis showed that the only factor associated with a higher risk of PAF was the absence of statin pretreatment (odds ratio = 4.31, 95% confidence interval 1.33-13.88; P=.015). There was no association between either extracorporeal circulation or the baseline CRP or NT-proBNP level and an increased risk of PAF.", 
    "91": "In everyday clinical practice, PAF is a frequent complication. Statin pretreatment could have a protective effect against its appearance.", 
    "92": "Information on the management of potentially adverse exposures to statins is limited. This study examined the pattern of 2331 statin exposures reported to Texas poison control centers during 1998-2004. In particular comparisons were made between exposures among pediatric (age < or = 5 yr) and adult (age > or = 20 yr) patients. The number of exposures increased from 134 in 1998 to 516 in 2004. Of the total exposures, 55% were to statins alone. Of the exposures to statins alone, 57% of the patients were < or = 5 yr of age and 22% were > or = 60 yr of age. The majority of exposures to statins alone (a) involved female patients (53%), (b) were unintentional (94%), (c) occurred at home (91%), (d) were managed on-site/at home (89%), and (e) had a final medical outcome classified as no effect (94%). Pediatric and adult patients differed with respect to patient gender (45 versus 66% female), exposure reason (100 versus 88% unintentional, 1 versus 75% therapeutic error), exposure site (14 versus 2% at other residence), final medical outcome (4 versus 11% minor effect, none versus 4% moderate effects), report of specific adverse clinical exposures (0.2 versus 5% neurological effects, none versus 1% cardiovascular effects), and listed treatments (60 versus 24% decontamination by dilution, 13 versus 6% decontamination by food). In conclusion, reported statin exposures are increasing. The majority of potentially adverse statin exposures reported to poison control centers may be successfully managed at home with favorable outcomes. The pattern of exposures differs with age.",

Pravastatin or saline post-ischemically were administered at subsequent time points: 6 h after tMCAO, and then on every subsequent day up to day 14 after tMCAO. Neurological outcome was investigated by using a neuroscore, the beam balance test and the rotarod test. Cholesterol and triglycerides levels were determined by blood sample analysis prior to sacrifice. Infarct area was calculated by microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) staining.

Since that time, there have been several important clinical studies directing the management of stroke patients and stroke prevention. Here, some important clinical trials published in 2006 that may affect stroke prevention and management were selected. A total of fifteen studies were reviewed and involved 141,585 participants. These studies included antithrombolytic therapy for stroke prevention in 3, statin to reduce cholesterol level for stroke prevention in 2, neuroprotection for acute ischemic stroke in 1, stenting for carotid artery stenosis management in 2, vitamin supplement and diet control for stroke prevention in 4, intracranial stenosis management in 1, and thrombolytic therapy in 2. It is required for realization of these studies because these may influence the stroke guidelines and implicate our clinical management of stroke patients.",

    "107": "Atherosclerosis is a result from the association of lipid deposition in the arterial wall and inflammatory process. This inflammatory process may be detected by clinical markers of systemic inflammation, such as ultrasensible C-reactive protein, which is associated with cardiovascular risk, independently of lipid levels. Statins reduce the inflammation associated to atherosclerosis, which may be verified by a reduction of the C-reactive protein levels. It seems that statins alter immune function by modulating post-translational protein prenylation. Individual genetic variations are associated with modulation of statins lipid-lowering effect; however, few studies have related the effect of the genetic variants with anti-inflammatory effect of statins. In addition to the genes involved in the cholesterol metabolism, genetic factors affecting statins pharmacodynamics and/or pharmacokinetics are potentially responsible for lipid and anti-inflammatory effects.", 
    "108": "In 2005, statins were among the most commonly used prescription medications in the United States. Some data suggest statins may affect cancer risk and/or disease severity. Because cholesterol is a required intermediate in sex steroid synthesis, it is possible that statins influence prostate cancer risk through effects on steroid hormone metabolism. We investigated whether levels of circulating androgens and their carrier protein, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), varied by statin exposure among a sample of 1,812 men from a population-based epidemiologic study, the Boston Area Community Health Survey.", 
    "109": "We measured serum total testosterone, free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, luteinizing hormone, and SHBG. Statin exposure was collected through participant self-report and/or interviewer-recorded information. Multivariate linear models were constructed to account for potential confounding.", 
    "110": "The prevalence of statin use was 12.4% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 10.3-14.9]. On average, statin users were older, had larger body mass index and more chronic illnesses, and used more medications. We found no relationship between statin use and free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, or luteinizing hormone. A significant association between statin use and total testosterone was initially observed but was not robust to covariate control in a multivariate model that included age, body mass index, time since awakening, and history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes (-5.5%; 95% CI, -13.2 to 2.9%). In multivariate models adjusted similarly, SHBG levels among statin users were statistically significantly lower compared with nonusers (-10.6%; 95% CI, -18.8 to -1.6%).",

    "112": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder that untreated has an almost one hundredfold risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). In an audit of 334 patients with premature CAD admitted to a Department of Cardiology, only 60% of medical records had sufficient clinical information for identifying FH. Of those with sufficient information recorded, 54% of patients had possible to definite FH on recognised clinical criteria. Amongst those with FH, only 38% were on statin therapy and only 22% were treated to National Heart Foundation targets. Detection and treatment of FH represents a major gap in coronary prevention.", 
    "113": "There is increasing evidence that statins reduce cardiovascular events such as coronary artery disease or stroke in hypercholesterolemic patients in both primary and secondary prevention. The striking benefit achieved with statin treatments in patients with a wide range of cholesterol levels cannot be attributed to their cholesterol lowering effect alone. Substantial data has recently accumulated showing that statins exert various effects on multiple targets, namely pleiotropic effects, especially targeting the concept of 'vascular failure', including the improvement of vascular endothelial function, inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, anti-inflammatory actions, anti-oxidative effects or stabilization of vulnerable plaques. These effects have potential in the treatments of coronary artery disease in various settings, such as prevention of its onset as well as its progression, or plaque rupture. Statin therapy should be more extensively applied even in normolipidemic patients if there are additional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or others. Furthermore, statins may be used to intervene in earlier stage risk conditions such as postprandial hyperlipidemia or hyperglycemia, insulin resistant state, masked hypertension, or metabolic syndrome to further reduce mortality or morbidity of coronary artery disease and heart failure.", 
    "114": "Some recent clinical trials have concluded the following: Patients who need noncardiac surgery and who are at risk of major cardiac events should not undergo revascularization with the aim of achieving a better perioperative outcome. They should have an office evaluation only and be prescribed a beta-blocker, if indicated. Except for unusual, high-risk cases, patients at risk of stroke due to atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis should undergo carotid endarterectomy rather than carotid stenting. Because the technology is still developing, however, carotid stenting may still be appropriate as part of a clinical trial. Although drug-eluting coronary stents reduce the risk of restenosis in the short-term, they pose a small but significant risk of in-stent thrombosis. Clopidogrel (Plavix) should be prescribed for at least a year following drug-eluting stent placement, and perhaps indefinitely. Patients with known coronary heart disease have better outcomes if they receive aggressive statin therapy (eg, atorvastatin [Lipitor] 80 mg/day) to lower their serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to less than 70 mg/dL.", 
    "115": "Biliary infection, including bacteria and cytomegalovirus (CMV), can induce inflammatory response and lead to bile duct damage after liver transplantation. This process may involve a major class of pattern recognition receptors-TLRs (Toll-like receptors). Stimulation of these receptors by pathogens (CMV, bacteria, etc.) in bile duct can induce the secretion of a series of cytokines/chemokines mainly via a TLR-2/4-MyD88-dependent pathway. Strategies for prevention and treatment of biliary infection, such as selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and preemptive therapy with gancyclovir and antibiotics are not so satisfactory. Statin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, have special anti-inflammatory abilities. They can inhibit the expression of TLR-4 and TLR-2, and block the signaling pathways of LPS (TLR-2/4), virus-encoded envelope proteins (TLR-2) and HSP70 (TLR-2/4), This process can lead to a reduction of effector cytokines/chemokines. In addition, statins can suppress the replication of CMV by reducing NF-kappaB binding activity. We hypothesized that statins can be useful for reducing infection evoked cholangiopathy after liver transplantation. We provide reliable evidence supporting the hypothesis and offer proposals for future application.", 
    "116": "A drug delivery system (DDS) that targets the injured myocardium would serve as a novel therapeutic tool for cardiac diseases. To develop such a DDS, we investigated the interaction of 2 types of glycoside-conjugated liposomes containing a fluorescence substrate with cardiomyocytes. Flow cytometry revealed that cardiomyocytes adequately interact with N-acetylglucosamine-conjugated liposomes (GlcNAc-Ls). Furthermore, to confirm whether the agents encapsulated in GlcNAc-Ls affect the intracellular environment of cardiomyocytes, we prepared GlcNAc-Ls-containing pravastatin and examined the effect of pravastatin on cardiomyocytes. Pravastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) and is hydrophilic. It is reported that lipophilic statins enhance nitric oxide (NO) production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression by interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-stimulated cardiomyocytes. The hydrophilic nature of pravastatin prevents its entry into cardiomyocytes; therefore, it cannot enhance both these processes. Treatment with GlcNAc-Ls-containing pravastatin specifically enhanced NO production and iNOS expression by IL-1beta-stimulated cardiomyocytes. Based on these results, we found that cardiomyocytes exhibit a high degree of interaction with GlcNAc-Ls, and GlcNAc-Ls-encapsulated agents can be effectively taken up by cardiomyocytes. We suggest that GlcNAc-Ls can be utilized therapeutically as a DDS for the injured myocardium.", 
    "117": "The long-term efficacy and safety of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been established in large multicenter trials. Inhibition of this enzyme, however, results in decreased synthesis of cholesterol and other products downstream of mevalonate, such as CoQ10 or dolichol. This was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study that examined the effects of CoQ10 and placebo in hypercholesterolemic patients treated by atorvastatin. Eligible patients were given 10mg/day of atorvastatin for 16 weeks. Half of the patients (n=24) were supplemented with 100mg/day of CoQ10, while the other half (n=25) were given the placebo. Serum LDL-C levels in the CoQ10 group decreased by 43%, while in the placebo group by 49%. The HDL-C increment was more striking in the CoQ10 group than in the placebo group. All patients showed definite reductions of plasma CoQ10 levels in the placebo group, by 42%. All patients supplemented with CoQ10 showed striking increases in plasma CoQ10 by 127%. In conclusion atorvastatin definitely decreased plasma CoQ10 levels and supplementation with CoQ10 increased their levels. These changes in plasma CoQ10 levels showed no relation to the changes in serum AST, ALT and CK levels. Further studies are needed, however, for the evaluation of CoQ10 supplementation in statin therapy.",

    "122": "Heart disease and stroke are the most life-threatening consequences of diabetes mellitus, with mortality rates up to two to four times higher for persons with diabetes vs. those without and accounting for up to 65% of deaths. The cardiometabolic syndrome is a potent indicator of future risk of type 2 diabetes and concomitant increased potential for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Pharmacologic treatment is usually necessary to improve blood pressure and lipids, thereby decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. The reduction of cardiovascular and renal risk with type 2 diabetes and elevated blood pressure are compelling indications for thiazide diuretics, blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Nevertheless, most patients with type 2 diabetes and elevated blood pressure will require two or more agents to lower blood pressure to the recommended goal of <130/80 mm Hg, and combination therapy may be beneficial. In patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome without type 2 diabetes, the present goal is to maintain BP <140/90 mm Hg, although recent data suggest potential decrease in the progression of prehypertension to hypertension with antihypertensive medication. Furthermore, blockers of the renin-angiotensin system may actually prevent newonset diabetes. It is reasonable for patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease to achieve an optional low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal <70 mg/dL, and statin therapy should be considered regardless of baseline LDL-C level. In patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome without type 2 diabetes and calculated moderately high-risk status (two or more risk factors; 10-year risk, 10%-20%), the present goal for LDL-C is <130 mg/dL, with perhaps a therapeutic option of <100 mg/dL, and in patients with the cardiometabolic syndrome at lower risk, the LDL-C goal remains <160 mg/dL. Multifactorial management must be utilized to prevent progression of cardiovascular risk with the cardiometabolic syndrome and the ravages of cardiovascular disease in persons with type 2 diabetes, including antiplatelet therapy with aspirin.", 
    "123": "Diabetes mellitus confers a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and requires aggressive management of all cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetic dyslipidemia. Although levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are often normal or only slightly elevated in persons with diabetes, lipid-altering therapy with statins has been shown in large, randomized, controlled trials to decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications in this patient population. A target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of <70 mg/dL is now a therapeutic option in patients at very high risk for coronary heart disease, including patients with diabetes. Diabetes is also a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. In addition to their lipid-modifying effects, statins have been shown to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy and potentially exert other renoprotective effects; these benefits, however, remain to be confirmed in clinical trials.",

We hypothesized that antiproliferative (rapamycin) and proapoptotic (statins) agents, already used clinically for other indications, would decrease experimental PAH, facilitating translation to human therapies. Prior studies in the rat monocrotaline-PAH model have indicated that simvastatin regresses and rapamycin prevents, but cannot reverse, PAH. Two PAH regression strategies (rapamycin monotherapy vs. rapamycin + atorvastatin) and one prevention strategy (simvastatin) were tested in a rat monocrotaline-PAH model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to saline (n = 6) or monocrotaline (60 mg/kg ip, n = 36) treatment groups. Monocrotaline rats were randomized to gavage with vehicle, rapamycin (2.5 mgxkg(-1)xday(-1)), or rapamycin + atorvastatin (10 mgxkg(-1)xday(-1)) treatment groups, beginning 12 days post-monocrotaline. Echocardiographic and hemodynamic end points were assessed 2 wk later. Additional monocrotaline-PAH rats (n = 20) were randomized to vehicle or simvastatin (2 mgxkg(-1)xday(-1)) treatment groups and followed echocardiographically for 4 wk. Monocrotaline-PAH increased lung p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation, and this was reversed by rapamycin, confirming the biological activity of rapamycin. Despite the use of high doses, neither rapamcyin nor rapamycin + atorvastatin improved survival nor reduced PAH, vascular remodeling, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Although prophylactic simvastatin slowed PAH progression, by 4 wk PAH severity and mortality were not different from placebo. Apart from the new finding of p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation in monocrotaline-PAH, this is a negative therapeutic trial (none of these promising therapies improved monocrotaline-PAH). These negative results should be considered as human trials with these agents are underway (simvastatin) or proposed (rapamycin).", 
    "143": "Microvascular injury plays a key role in normal tissue radiation responses. Statins, in addition to their lipid-lowering effects, have vasculoprotective properties that may counteract some effects of radiation on normal tissues. We examined whether administration of simvastatin ameliorates intestinal radiation injury, and whether the effect depends on protein C activation.", 
    "144": "Rats received localized, fractionated small bowel irradiation. The animals were fed either regular chow or chow containing simvastatin from 2 weeks before irradiation until termination of the experiment. Groups of rats were euthanized at 2 weeks and 26 weeks for assessment of early and delayed radiation injury by quantitative histology, morphometry, and quantitative immunohistochemistry. Dependency on protein C activation was examined in thrombomodulin (TM) mutant mice with deficient ability to activate protein C.", 
    "145": "Simvastatin administration was associated with lower radiation injury scores (p < 0.0001), improved mucosal preservation (p = 0.0009), and reduced thickening of the intestinal wall and subserosa (p = 0.008 and p = 0.004), neutrophil infiltration (p = 0.04), and accumulation of collagen I (p = 0.0003). The effect of simvastatin was consistently more pronounced for delayed than for early injury. Surprisingly, simvastatin reduced intestinal radiation injury in TM mutant mice, indicating that the enteroprotective effect of simvastatin after localized irradiation is unrelated to protein C activation.", 
    "146": "Simvastatin ameliorates the intestinal radiation response. The radioprotective effect of simvastatin after localized small bowel irradiation does not appear to be related to protein C activation. Statins should undergo clinical testing as a strategy to minimize side effects of radiation on the intestine and other normal tissues.",

The ileum was irradiated locally after surgical exteriorization (X-rays, 19 Gy). Acute apoptosis, acute and late histologic alterations, and late CTGF and collagen deposition were monitored by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry and colorimetric staining (6 h, 3 days, 14 days, 15 weeks, and 26 weeks after irradiation). Pravastatin antitumor action was studied in HT-29, HeLa, and PC-3 cells by clonogenic cell survival assays and tumor growth delay experiments.", 
    "149": "Pravastatin improved delayed radiation enteropathy in rats, whereas its benefit in acute and subacute injury remained limited (6 h, 3 days, and 14 days after irradiation). Delayed structural improvement was associated with decreased CTGF and collagen deposition but seemed unrelated to acute damage. Indeed, the early apoptotic index increased, and severe subacute structural damage occurred. Pravastatin elicited a differential effect, protecting normal intestine but not tumors from radiation injury.",

Women who were diagnosed from 1997 to 2000 and identified from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Cancer Registry entered the cohort on average 2 years post-diagnosis. Information on statin use was obtained from the KPNC pharmacy database. A total of 210 breast cancer recurrences were reported and verified by medical record review. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).", 
    "153": "The mean duration of statin use in the cohort among those who initiated use post-diagnosis was 1.96 years, and lipophilic statins were mainly used (97.8%). Starting statins after diagnosis was suggestive of a decreased risk of breast cancer recurrence (RR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.39-1.13). Risk of recurrence decreased with increasing duration of statin use after diagnosis (p linear trend = 0.02).",

    "155": "In patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including hypertensive individuals, lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces CVD risk. Statins are the most effective of available therapies for lowering LDL-C. Extensive clinical trial data have shown that the degree of LDL-C reduction obtained depends on the particular statin used and that intensive LDL-C lowering reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events compared with more moderate LDL-C lowering. More recent data suggest that effects independent of LDL-C lowering may also play a part in the reduction in cardiovascular events. C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, is a potential predictor of CVD risk, and statins reduce CRP levels by up to 60%. CRP reduction is independent of LDL-C lowering, and variation between statins in CRP reduction may play some role in CVD event reduction rates. At present, however, there are few outcome data relating to the cardiovascular benefits of reducing CRP.",

Subjects indicated statin use and smoking history at each visit. We used mixed linear models to estimate the effects of each covariate, adjusting for subject and possible confounders.", 
    "159": "For those not using statins, the estimated decline in FEV(1) was 23.9 ml/year (95% confidence interval [CI], -27.8 to -20.1 ml/yr), whereas those taking statins had an estimated 10.9-ml/year decline in FEV(1) (95% CI, -16.9 to -5.0 ml/yr). We also examined the effect of statins with smoking by dividing the cohort into four groups: never-smokers, longtime quitters (quit >or= 10 yr ago), recent quitters (quit < 10 yr ago), and current smokers. We found a significant three-way interaction between time since first visit, statin use, and smoking status (P < 0.001). Within each smoking category, the effect of statins was always estimated to be beneficial, but the size of the improvement in the decline rate varied among smoking groups. We found similar results for FVC decline.",

    "162": "Atorvastatin was titrated (10-80 mg/day) to maintain LDL-C<2.5 mmol/L and patients were randomized to receive amlodipine (5-10mg/day, n=64) or placebo (n=70) for 12 months. Brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) was assessed using vascular ultrasound. Inflammatory markers were also measured. At 12 months there was a significant decrease in mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (4.4-2.1 mmol/L, P<0.0001), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (3.8-2.3mg/L, P<0.0001) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) (710-665 ng/mL, P<0.0001) for all patients, compared with baseline. Amlodipine was associated with a mean blood pressure reduction of 8/3 mm Hg (P<0.0001) whereas patients on placebo had no significant change. In the atorvastatin-placebo group, mean FMD increased (7.3-9.5%, P<0.05) with no change in nitroglycerin-mediated dilation. No further benefit on FMD or inflammatory markers was observed with the addition of amlodipine.",

We interviewed 71 patients who had received a new prescription for statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, first at the time of prescription and then again 3 and 6 months later. Patients were asked about their beliefs regarding diet and medications as well as their diet during the past 24 hours in all interviews and about their adherence to statins in the 3- and 6-month follow-up interviews. At the time of statin prescription, 54 participants (76 percent) wanted to reduce dietary fat, 50 (70 percent) believed statin use could cure their hyperlipidemia, and 31 (44 percent) thought that physicians prescribed statins to them despite their preference to continue to try dietary changes.

Physician, pharmacy, prescription, and patient covariates were considered in a cross-classified hierarchical regression model.", 
    "168": "The average number of refills dispensed was 4.75 per patient. Patients younger than 50 years had, on average, 13.6% fewer refills per year than did patients older than 70 years (P<0.001). Women were 4.4% less adherent than men (P = 0.041). Patients residing in southern states were significantly less adherent than were other patients; they had 19.4% fewer refills per year than did patients from western states (P<0.001). Each prescription dispensed for comorbid conditions increased adherence by 2.0% (P =0.002), and patients with a history of cardiovascular drug use were 14.1% more adherent than were other patients (P <0.001). Patients on a higher statin dose appeared to be 8.4% less adherent than were patients on a lower dose (P <0.001). Adherence was greater as the number of prescribed refills increased, with a rate of 2.1% per refill (P <0.001). Adherence was lower for patients with higher copayments, with a rate of 2.2% per each additional $10 of copayment (P <0.001). For patients treated by physicians in the top 2.5 percentile and bottom 2.5 percentile of statin adherence, mean refill counts per year were 6.1 and 2.9, respectively. For patients who patronized pharmacies in the top 2.5 percentile and bottom 2.5 percentile of statin adherence, mean refill counts per year were 6.6 and 2.5, respectively. Adherence increased at a rate of 28.4% per each additional 100 statin patients per patronized pharmacy (P <0.001) and decreased at a rate of about 6.5% per each additional 10 statin patients per treating physician (P <0.001).",

    "179": "Statins are widely used cholesterol-lowering drugs that selectively inhibit the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, leading to decreased cholesterol biosynthesis. Emerging data indicate that statins stimulate apoptotic cell death in several types of proliferating tumor cells, including breast cancer cells, which is independent of its cholesterol-lowering property. The objective here was to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which statins induce breast cancer cell death. Fluvastatin and simvastatin (5-10 mumol/L) treatment enhanced the caspase-3-like activity and DNA fragmentation in MCF-7 cells, and significantly inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells but not MCF-10 cells (noncancerous epithelial cells). Statin-induced cytotoxic effects were reversed by mevalonate, an immediate metabolic product of the acetyl CoA/3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase reaction. Both simvastatin and fluvastatin enhanced nitric oxide ((.)NO) levels which were inhibited by mevalonate. Statin-induced (.)NO and tumor cell cytotoxicity were inhibited by 1400W, a more specific inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS II). Both fluvastatin and simvastatin increased iNOS mRNA and protein expression. Stimulation of iNOS by statins via inhibition of geranylgeranylation by GGTI-298, but not via inhibition of farnesylation by FTI-277, enhanced the proapoptotic effects of statins in MCF-7 cells. Statin-mediated antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects were exacerbated by sepiapterin, a precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin, an essential cofactor of (.)NO biosynthesis by NOS. We conclude that iNOS-mediated (.)NO is responsible in part for the proapoptotic, tumoricidal, and antiproliferative effects of statins in MCF-7 cells.",

We assessed patient awareness of smoking, hypertension (HT), hypercholesterolaemia (HC), obesity, family history (FM) and diabetes (DM) and role of medication in secondary prevention. One hundred and eighty-seven ex- or current smokers (79.6%), 175 hypercholesterolaemic (74.5%), 116 had a family history (49.4%), 88 were hypertensive (37.4%), 62 obese (26.4%) and 45 diabetic (19.1%).

A majority of the patients identified their own risk factors correctly. More than 95% of the patients were taking aspirin/clopidogrel and/or a statin. The main sources of information for these patients were hospitals, general practitioners, and booklets. Risk factor awareness in patients undergoing CABG is unsatisfactory. Nearly 95% of patients are taking aspirin/clopidogrel and/or statins, however, just over half realise their role in secondary prevention.

    "186": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is associated with high rates of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events; PAD is a marker of systemic atherosclerosis. As a result, standard therapy for all PAD patients should be directed at both peripheral and systemic atherosclerosis. Modification of established risk factors in the form of smoking cessation, correcting hypertension, optimizing diabetic control and normalizing lipids is essential. Furthermore, novel risk factors have emerged including fibrinogen and other hemostatic factors. Fibrinogen is a coagulation factor and a marker of the acute phase response (inflammation), a platelet activator, a major determinant of plasma viscosity and a component of the atherosclerotic plaque. Fibrinogen appears not only to predict the severity of PAD, but also serves as a marker for future development of PAD. Whether reducing the levels of fibrinogen and other coagulation factors will decrease the incidence and progression of PAD remains to be resolved. This review summarizes the role of fibrinogen in the pathogenesis of PAD and its association with other hemostatic factors. The role of fibrinolysis in patients with PAD is also considered.", 
    "187": "We investigated whether atorvastatin, given in a dose to low to influence the lipid profile, has any effect on oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial function under streptozotocin-induced diabetic conditions. Diabetes mellitus was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats by a single injection of streptozotocin. Rats were treated chronically with atorvastatin (50 mg/kg/day; p.o.) or vehicle until day 48 and compared with controls. NAD(P)H activity, protein expression nuclear factor-kappaBp65 (NF-kappaBp65) and phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) were assessed in the quadriceps muscle. Protein and mRNA levels of intracellular and vascular adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and cytokines were measured by Taqman or immunohistochemistry staining, respectively. Endothelial function was investigated in vivo using the autoperfused hind limb model. Diabetic groups displayed similar severe hyperglycemia. Untreated diabetic rats showed enhanced NAD(P)H activity, activation of the ERK1/2/NF-kappaBp65-pathway, enhanced expression of cytokines and cellular adhesion molecules and impaired vascular function. Low-dose therapy by atorvastatin did not alter the lipid profile but led to a reduction of NAD(P)H activity (-28%, P<0.05) associated with reduced protein expression of NF-kappaBp65 (-53%, P<0.05) and phosphorylation of its regulator mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ERK1/2 in diabetic rats. Also inflammatory markers were reduced after atorvastatin treatment indexed by reduced mRNA expression of VCAM-1 (-24%), tumor necrosis factor alpha (-59%) and interleukin 1beta (-50%) and reduced ICAM-1 (-81%) and VCAM-1 (-74%) positive staining. These beneficial effects were associated with improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (maximal vasodilatation: +101%; P<0.05). Lipid-independent anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of low-dose atorvastatin involving the ERK1/2/NF-kappaB-pathway are sufficient to improve endothelial function under experimental diabetic conditions."
