Although statin therapy is generally well tolerated, some patients fail to achieve the target level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or discontinue the treatment for the occurrence of adverse events. In recent years new lipid-modifying agents have been studied to overcome these limitations and to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma levels. Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, thereby preventing its interaction with low density lipoprotein receptors. Several trials have been conducted in the last few years to evaluate long-term effects of this new molecule on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and cardiovascular risk.", 
    "1": "In patients with dyslipidemia, elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, or TG-rich lipoproteins, and cardiovascular risk may remain despite statin therapy. Prescription omega-3 fatty acid formulations containing the ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (omega-3-acid ethyl esters; Lovaza\u00ae) or high-purity EPA ethyl ester (icosapent ethyl; Vascepa\u00ae) are TG-lowering treatments that may be administered in addition to statins. Here we describe the effects of switching from omega-3-acid ethyl esters to icosapent ethyl in a 44-year-old obese man with dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient was receiving stable treatment with medications, including atorvastatin 40\u00a0mg/day and extended-release niacin 1000\u00a0mg/day. Owing to persistently elevated TG levels and other cardiovascular risk factors, the patient was initiated on omega-3-acid ethyl esters 4\u00a0g/day. After approximately 2\u00a0years on omega-3-acid ethyl esters, his total cholesterol (TC) level was 184\u00a0mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level was 81\u00a0mg/dL, TG level was elevated at 307\u00a0mg/dL despite statin therapy, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) level was 144\u00a0mg/dL. After the switch to icosapent ethyl, TC level decreased by 34% to 121\u00a0mg/dL, LDL-C level decreased by 28% to 58\u00a0mg/dL, TG level decreased by 41% to 180\u00a0mg/dL, and non-HDL-C level decreased by 44% to 81\u00a0mg/dL. Switching from omega-3-acid ethyl esters containing both EPA and DHA to icosapent ethyl containing high-purity EPA resulted in beneficial and substantial changes in the lipid profile with a notable reduction of TG levels along with additional reductions in LDL-C levels in a statin-treated obese patient with persistently high TG levels. Treatment with icosapent ethyl was well tolerated.", 
    "2": "The objective of the present investigation was to develop and optimize reservoir-type of transdermal drug delivery system of Simvastatin using response surface methodology. A total of 17 experimental runs were conducted according to three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken design employing Design expert\u00ae2 software to determine the effect of independent variables (simvastatin concentration, percentage of poloxamer 407, and concentration of D-limonene) on cumulative amount of simvastatin permeation through human cadaver skin in 48 h (dependent variable). The experimental data was fitted to different response surface models using multiple regression analysis and observed quadratic model was the best fit model with significant p-value (p\ua78a0.0003) and coefficient of determination value of 0.9949. The second-order polynomial equation and response surface plots indicated the significant influence of concentration of simvastatin and D-limonene on the simvastatin permeation in 48 h. The highest simvastatin permeation value of 76.94 \u03bcg/cm2 was observed in case of experimental number 10 with 1.5% (w/w) of simvastatin, 25% (w/w) of poloxamer 407, and 10% (w/w) of D-limonene. Using Derringer's desirability functional tool for optimization, the highest simvastatin permeation value of 78.7684 \u03bcg/cm2 in 48 h was predicted under optimum condition of; simvastatin concentration of 1.4893% (w/w), poloxamer 407 percentage of 22.43% (w/w), and D-limonene concentration of 9.8541% (w/w) with optimum desirability value. The in-vivo hypolipidemic study conducted for 14 days in hyperlipidemia induced Sprague-Dawley rats revealed that the optimized patch exhibited significant lowering of blood lipid profile. Finally, histology study was performed on skin sample used in permeation study of optimized formulation and compared with untreated skin sample. The treated skin sample showed a significant distortion in stratum corneum, which supported the ex-vivo permeation result. Thus, the patch may serve as an alternative therapy to oral dosage form of simvastatin with outmost patient compliance.",

Compared with CHD patients without diabetes mellitus (DM), the effect of statin treatment on apoCIII markers was minor in CHD patients with DM. And HDL-apoCIII correlated with plasma TG significantly in non-CHD and CHD patients (p\u2009<\u20090.05), but the correlation in CHD patients did not exist after statin treatment (p\u2009>\u20090.05).",

    "7": "Statins lower cholesterol and are commonly prescribed for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease risk. Statins have pleotropic actions beyond cholesterol lowering, including decreased protein prenylation, which can alter immune function. The general anti-inflammatory effect of statins may be a key pleiotropic effect that improves cardiovascular disease risk. However, a series of findings have shown that statins increase the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1\u03b2, via decreased protein prenylation in immune cells. IL-1\u03b2 can be regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasome containing caspase-1. Statins have been associated with an increased risk of new onset diabetes. Inflammation can promote ineffective insulin action (insulin resistance), which often precedes diabetes. This review highlights the links between statins, insulin resistance and immunity via the NLRP3 inflammasome. We propose that statin-induced changes in immunity should be investigated as a mechanism underlying increased risk of diabetes. It is possible that statin-related insulin resistance occurs through a separate pathway from various mechanisms that confer cardiovascular benefits. Therefore, understanding the potential mechanisms that segregate statin-induced cardiovascular effects from those that cause dysglycemia may lead to improvements in this drugs class.", 
    "8": "Recent studies have indicated that statins induce osteogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. The molecular mechanism of statin-stimulated osteogenesis is unknown. Activation of RhoA signaling increases cytoskeletal tension, which plays a crucial role in the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. We thus hypothesized that RhoA signaling is involved in simvastatin-induced osteogenesis in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. We found that although treatment with simvastatin shifts localization of RhoA protein from the membrane to the cytosol, the treatment still activates RhoA dose-dependently because it reduces the association with RhoGDI\u03b1. Simvastatin also increased the expression of osteogenic proteins, density of actin filament, the number of focal adhesions, and cellular tension. Furthermore, disrupting actin cytoskeleton or decreasing cell rigidity by using chemical agents reduced simvastatin-induced osteogenic differentiation. In vivo study also confirms that density of actin filament is increased in simvastatin-induced ectopic bone formation. Our study is the first to demonstrate that maintaining intact actin cytoskeletons and enhancing cell rigidity are crucial in simvastatin-induced osteogenesis. The results suggested that simvastatin, which is an osteoinductive factor and acts by increasing actin filament organization and cell rigidity combined with osteoconductive biomaterials, may benefit stem-cell-based bone regeneration.",

This study investigated the effects of statins on the recovery of NA neuron circuitry and its function after transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI). Using the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) transgene technique combined with the recombinant adenoviral vector system, NA-specific neuronal pathways were labeled, and were identified in the locus coeruleus (LC), where NA neurons originate. NA circuitry in the atorvastatin-treated group recovered faster than in the vehicle-treated group. The damaged NA circuitry was partly reorganized with the gradual recovery of autonomic dysfunction and neurobehavioral deficit.

Promoter luciferase reporter analyses showed that treating HepG2 cells with PPAR\u03b4 agonist L165041 markedly increased the activity of a full-length LDLR promoter construct (pLDLR-1192) without any effects on the shorter promoter reporter pLDLR-234 that contains only the core regulatory elements SRE-1 and SP1 sites. Importantly, mutation of the PPRE sequence greatly attenuated the induction of the full-length LDLR promoter activity by L165041 without affecting rosuvastatin (RSV)-mediated transactivation. EMSA and ChIP assay further confirmed the binding of PPAR\u03b4 to the LDLR-PPRE site.

    "54": "Statins exhibit neuroprotective effects after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the molecular mechanism underlying these effects remains unknown. This study demonstrates that the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin (Simv) exhibits neuroprotective effects on neuronal apoptosis and supports functional recovery in a rat SCI model by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. In specific, Simv administration after SCI significantly up-regulated the expression of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 phosphorylation and \u03b2-catenin protein, increased the mRNA expression of lymphoid enhancer factor-1 and T-cell factor-1, and suppressed the expression of \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation in the spinal cord neurons. Simv enhanced motor neuronal survival in the spinal cord anterior horn and decreased the lesion of spinal cord tissues after SCI. Simv administration after SCI also evidently reduced the expression levels of Bax, active caspase-3, and active caspase-9 in the spinal cord neurons and the proportion of transferase UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive neuron cells, but increased the expression level of Bcl-2 in the spinal cord neurons. However, the anti-apoptotic effects of Simv were reduced in cultured spinal cord nerve cells when the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed in the lipopolysaccharide-induced model. Furthermore, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores indicated that Simv treatment significantly improved the locomotor functions of rats after SCI. This study is the first to report that Simv exerts neuroprotective effects by reducing neuronal apoptosis, and promoting functional and pathological recovery after SCI by activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. We verified the neuroprotective properties associated with simvastatin following spinal cord injury (SCI). Simvastatin reduced neuronal apoptosis, improved the functional and pathological recovery via activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal pathway, however, the anti-apoptosis effects of simvastatin were reversed following suppressing Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in primary spinal cord neurons. The significant findings may provide clinical therapeutic value of simvastatin for treating SCI.",

For homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HOFH), a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein MTP inhibitor (Lopitamide) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) (Mipomersen) have recently been approved by FDA, USA through 'Risk evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)'. Possible future therapies include PCSK-9 inhibitors which have excellent lipid lowering properties. Three monoclonal antibodies (PCSK 9 Inhibitors) alirocumab, evolocumab and Bococizumab are under advanced clinical stage IV trials and awaiting approval by FDA and European Medicines Agency.", 
    "112": "Statins substantially reduce cardiovascular mortality and appear to have beneficial effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties. We evaluated the hypothesis that statin use may modulate the secretion of aldosterone, a well-known contributor to cardiovascular disease.", 
    "113": "We measured adrenal hormones in 2 intervention studies. In study 1 in hypertensive subjects, aldosterone was analyzed at baseline and after angiotensin II stimulation on both high- and low-sodium diets (1122 observations, 15% on statins for >3 months). Statin users had 33% lower aldosterone levels in adjusted models (P<0.001). Cortisol was not modified by statins. In secondary analyses, the lowest aldosterone levels were seen with lipophilic statins and with higher doses. Statin users had lower blood pressure and reduced salt sensitivity of blood pressure (both P<0.001). In study 2, aldosterone was measured in diabetic patients on a high-sodium diet, before and after angiotensin II stimulation (143 observations, 79% statin users). Again, statin users had 26% lower aldosterone levels (P=0.006), particularly those using lipophilic statins. Ex vivo studies in rat adrenal glomerulosa cells confirmed that lipophilic statins acutely inhibited aldosterone, but not corticosterone, in response to different secretagogues.", 
    "114": "Statin use among hypertensive and diabetic subjects was associated with lower aldosterone secretion in response to angiotensin II and a low-sodium diet in 2 human intervention studies. This effect appeared to be most pronounced with lipophilic statins and higher doses. Future studies to evaluate whether aldosterone inhibition may partially explain the robust cardioprotective effects of statins are warranted.",

    "120": "Systemically administered pravastatin effectively treats diabetic retinopathy without central nervous system side effects. The efflux transport mechanism of pravastatin from the brain has already been clarified. In this study, the influx of pravastatin across the blood-retinal and blood-brain barriers (BRB and BBB) and the efflux of pravastatin from the retina were investigated using rats. Pravastatin influx (blood-to-tissues) was assessed using the retinal and brain uptake index (RUI and BUI) methods, and microdialysis was performed to investigate the efflux (retina-to-blood) transport of pravastatin. The RUI and BUI values for [(3)H]pravastatin were lower than those expected based on its lipophilicity, suggesting that the influx transport across the BRB and BBB was less than the reverse-direction transport. The RUI and BUI values for [(3)H]pravastatin were significantly decreased by pravastatin, digoxin, and probenecid, indicating that pravastatin undergoes carrier-mediated influx transport in the blood-to-tissues direction across the BRB and BBB. After intravitreal injection, [(3)H]pravastatin and the bulk flow marker [(14)C]d-mannitol were found to be eliminated biexponentially from the vitreous humor. The elimination rate constant of [(3)H]pravastatin during the terminal phase was 1.66-fold greater than that of [(14)C]d-mannitol. Efflux transport was reduced in the retinal presence of pravastatin, digoxin, and benzylpenicillin, suggesting that pravastatin is transported via efflux transporters. In conclusion, pravastatin is transported across the BRB via uptake and efflux transporters in both the blood-to-retina and retina-to-blood directions, and the retina-to-blood transporters are dominant, based on the lower values of the RUI compared with the values expected from the lipophilicity.", 
    "121": "Statins are potent cholesterol-lowering drugs and are generally well tolerated. Hepatotoxicity is a rare but serious adverse effect of statins; however, its mechanisms are not clear. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency has been suggested, and supplementation of reduced coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinol) has been shown to have hepatoprotective effects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small nucleotides that have been shown to be up-regulated in drug-induced liver injury. We hypothesized that circulating miRNAs may be differentially regulated after simvastatin treatment and by comparing with that of simvastatin and ubiquinol supplementation could potentially uncover signatory miRNA profile for simvastatin-induced liver injury. In this double-blind, prospective, randomized-controlled trial, miRNA profiles and liver enzymes were compared between simvastatin-treated patients, with and without ubiquinol supplementation, over 12 weeks compared to baseline. miRNA expression was further validated in HepG2 liver cell lines by real-time PCR. Changes in miR-192, miR-146a, miR-148a, miR-15a, and miR-21 were positively correlated (p<0.05) with alanine aminotransferase in simvastatin-only treated patients. In ubiquinol supplementation group, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were significantly down-regulated after 12 weeks and changes in miR-15a, miR-21 and miR-33a were negatively correlated with alkaline phosphatase (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Bioinformatics analyses predicted that miRNA regulation in simvastatin group was related to reduce proliferation and adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporters. Ubiquinol supplementation additionally regulated miRNAs that inhibit apoptotic and inflammatory pathways, suggesting potential hepatoprotective effects. Our results suggest that 20\u2009mg/day of simvastatin does not have significant risk of hepatotoxicity and ubiquinol supplementation may, at the miRNA level, provide potential beneficial changes to reduce the effects of coenzyme Q10 deficiency in the liver.", 
    "122": "The effects of two wonder drugs, simvastatins and fenofibrates on the proximal part of the femoris of a series of ovariectomized and non-ovariectomized Wistar albino rats was estimated qualitatively and semi-quantitatively by the modern method of 1D 1H-NMR T2-distribution. The 72 rats subjected to this study were divided in six groups and were sacrificed at two, four, six and eight weeks after ovariectomy and the proximal part of femoris was harvested. The CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) echoes train curves were measured for the bones fully saturated with water during two months after two months of natural drying. These decays were analyzed by Laplace inversion and an average of normalized T2-distributions was considered for all rat's groups. The 1D averaged T2-distributions present four peaks, which were associated with protons in four major environments, from which the free water protons are used as spy molecules to explore the boundaries of cavities. In the approximation of spherical pores, the averaged T2-distributions were transformed in distributions of pores diameters. These were found in the range from 2 \u03bcm up to 2 mm. The relative amplitudes, widths and position of deconvoluted distributions of small, medium and large cavities are used for a qualitatively analysis of the effect of our lipid-lowering drugs. For a semi-quantitatively analysis, we chose the diameter d of proximal part of femoris' trabecular cavities. We show that the positive or negative effects of treatments with simvastatins and fenofibrates are strongly dependent on the duration of treatment. Moreover, the treatment of healthy bone is generally counter-indicated.", 
    "123": "Over the past few decades, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has gained special attention for management of cholesterol-associated metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) owing to its neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic properties. Several epidemiological studies have reported the effect of DHA in reducing the risk of developing AD by lowering cholesterol. Hypercholesterolemia is a pro-amyloidogenic factor influencing the enzymatic processing of amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (A\u03b2PP) to toxic \u03b2-amyloid. However, the mechanism by which DHA modulates the cholesterol pathway has not been established. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of regulation of cholesterol metabolism by DHA in an A\u03b2PP695 overexpressing AD cell model.",

The differential metabolite profiles between DHA- and vehicle-treated groups were further analyzed using fold change values of the ratio of concentration of metabolites in CHO-A\u03b2PP695 to CHO-wt cells. Effect of DHA on key rate-limiting enzymatic activities within the cholesterol pathway was established using biochemical assays.", 
    "125": "Our results showed that DHA reduced the levels of key cholesterol anabolites and catabolites in CHO-A\u03b2PP695 cells as compared to CHO-wt cells. Further enzymatic studies revealed that the cholesterol-lowering effect of DHA was mediated by regulating HMG-CoA reductase and squalene epoxidase enzyme activities.",

    "127": "The risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) in subjects with diabetes and \"metabolic dyslipidemia\" (high triglyceride [TGs] and low high-density cholesterol levels) remains a matter of concern. Little is known regarding the risk of CHD for this phenotype with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels <100 mg/dl. We analyzed a diabetes cohort of 28,318 members (aged 30 to 90 years) of Kaiser Permanente Northern California during 2002 to 2011 (192,356 person-years [p-y] follow-up), with LDL-C levels <100 mg/dl and without known CHD. We compared the incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) for CHD events in groups using Cox models: normal high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and TG (reference; n = 7,278, 25.7%); normal HDL and high TG (\u2265 150 mg/dl; n = 4,484,15.8%); low HDL (\u2264 50 mg/dl for women and \u2264 40 mg/dl for men) and normal TG (n = 4,048, 14.3%); low HDL and high TG (metabolic dyslipidemia; n = 12,508, 44%). Patients with metabolic dyslipidemia had the highest age-adjusted CHD events/1,000 p-y (12.7/1,000 p-y and 19.0/1,000 p-y for women and men, respectively). After multivariate adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity, hypertension, smoking, statin use, duration of diabetes, and hemoglobin A1c, we observed an increased CHD risk in women (HR 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.60) and men (HR 1.62, 95% confidence interval 1.43 to 1.83) with metabolic dyslipidemia compared to those with normal HDL and TG. Even in subjects with an LDL-C <100 mg/dl, presence of metabolic dyslipidemia in adults with diabetes is associated with an increased risk of CHD. In conclusion, effective CHD prevention strategies are needed for adults with diabetes and metabolic dyslipidemia.", 
    "128": "Cytosolic sulfotransferase 1C2 (SULT1C2) is expressed in the kidney, stomach, and liver of rats; however, the mechanisms regulating expression of this enzyme are not known. We evaluated transcriptional regulation of SULT1C2 by mevalonate (MVA)-derived intermediates in primary cultured rat hepatocytes using several cholesterol synthesis inhibitors. Blocking production of mevalonate with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin (30 \u03bcM), reduced SULT1C2 mRNA content by \u223c40% whereas the squalene synthase inhibitor squalestatin (SQ1, 0.1 \u03bcM), which causes accumulation of nonsterol isoprenoids, increased mRNA content by 4-fold. Treatment with MVA (10 mM) strongly induced SULT1C2 mRNA by 12-fold, and this effect was blocked by inhibiting squalene epoxidase but not by more distal cholesterol inhibitors, indicating the effects of MVA are mediated by postsqualene metabolites. Using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we characterized the 5' end of SULT1C2 mRNA and used this information to generate constructs for promoter analysis. SQ1 and MVA increased reporter activity by \u223c1.6- and 3-fold, respectively, from a construct beginning 49 base pairs (bp) upstream from the longest 5'-RACE product (-3140:-49). Sequence deletions from this construct revealed a hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) element (-2558), and mutation of this element reduced basal (75%) and MVA-induced (30%) reporter activity and attenuated promoter activation following overexpression of HNF1\u03b1 or 1\u03b2. However, the effects of SQ1 were localized to a more proximal promoter region (-281:-49). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates influence SULT1C2 expression in rat primary hepatocytes. Further, HNF1 appears to play an important role in mediating basal and MVA-induced SULT1C2 transcription.",

    "133": "Green tea catechins inhibit the function of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) that mediate the uptake of a diverse group of drugs and endogenous compounds into cells. The present study was aimed at investigating the effect of green tea and its most abundant catechin epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the transport activity of several drug transporters expressed in enterocytes, hepatocytes and renal proximal tubular cells such as OATPs, organic cation transporters (OCTs), multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs), and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Uptake of the typical substrates metformin for OCTs and MATEs and bromosulphophthalein (BSP) and atorvastatin for OATPs was measured in the absence and presence of a commercially available green tea and EGCG. Transcellular transport of digoxin, a typical substrate of P-gp, was measured over 4 hours in the absence and presence of green tea or EGCG in Caco-2 cell monolayers. OCT1-, OCT2-, MATE1- and MATE2-K-mediated metformin uptake was significantly reduced in the presence of green tea and EGCG (P < 0.05). BSP net uptake by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 was inhibited by green tea [IC50 2.6% (v/v) and 0.39% (v/v), respectively]. Green tea also inhibited OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated atorvastatin net uptake with IC50 values of 1.9% (v/v) and 1.0% (v/v), respectively. Basolateral to apical transport of digoxin was significantly decreased in the presence of green tea and EGCG. These findings indicate that green tea and EGCG inhibit multiple drug transporters in vitro. Further studies are necessary to investigate the effects of green tea on prototoypical substrates of these transporters in humans, in particular on substrates of hepatic uptake transporters (e.g. statins) as well as on P-glycoprotein substrates.",

In this clinical absorption study, the primary objective was to investigate the effect of liraglutide (at steady state) on the rate and/or extent of gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of concomitantly orally taken drugs from three classes of the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS). To provide a general prediction on liraglutide drug-drug absorption interaction, single-dose pharmacokinetics of drugs representing BCS classes II (low solubility-high permeability; atorvastatin 40 mg and griseofulvin 500 mg), III (high solubility-low permeability; lisinopril 20 mg), and IV (low solubility-low permeability; digoxin 1 mg) were studied in healthy subjects at steady state of liraglutide 1.8 mg, or placebo, in a two-period crossover design. With liraglutide, the oral drugs atorvastatin, lisinopril, and digoxin showed delayed tmax (by \u22642 h) and did not meet the criterion for bioequivalence for Cmax (reduced Cmax by 27-38%); griseofulvin had similar tmax and 37% increased Cmax. Although the prespecified bioequivalence criterion was not met by all drugs, the overall plasma exposure (AUC) of griseofulvin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and digoxin only exhibited minor changes and was not considered to be of clinical relevance.",

The study cohort comprised 5179 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer who used statins for at least 6 months between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2010. To form a comparison group, each patient was randomly frequency-matched (according to age and index date) with a prostate cancer patient who did not use any type of statin-based drugs during the study period. The study endpoint was mortality. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using Cox regression models. Among prostate cancer patients, statin use was associated with significantly decreased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.60-0.71). This phenomenon was observed among various types of statin, age groups, and treatment methods. Analyzing the defined daily dose of statins indicated that both low- and high-dose groups exhibited significantly decreased death rates compared with nonusers, suggesting a dose-response relationship. The results of this population-based cohort study suggest that using statins reduces all-cause mortality among prostate cancer patients, and a dose-response relationship may exist.",

These isoprenoid intermediates are required for activation of various intracellular/signaling proteins- small guanosine triphosphate bound protein Ras and Ras-like proteins like Rho, Rab, Rac, Ral, or Rap which plays an indispensible role in multiple cellular processes. Reduction of circulating isoprenoids intermediates as a result of HMG CoA reductase inhibition by statins prevents activation of these signalling proteins. Hence, the multiple effects of statins such as antiinflammatory effects, antioxidant effects, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects, plaque stability, normalization of sympathetic outflow, and prevention of platelet aggregation are due to reduction of circulating isoprenoids and hence inactivation of signalling proteins. These multiple lipid-independent effects of statins termed as statin pleiotropy would potentially open floodgates for research in multiple treatment domains catching attentions of researchers and clinician across the globe.",

In the present study, lovastatin (LVT)-loaded NLCs (LVT-NLCs) were successfully prepared by hot high-pressure homogenization method with high entrapment efficiency, drug loading, and satisfactory particle size distribution. The particles had almost spherical and uniform shapes and were well dispersed with a particle size of <50 nm (23.5 \u00b1 1.6 nm) and a low polydispersity index (0.17 \u00b1 0.05 mV). The result of stability showed that the LVT-NLCs dispersion maintained excellent stability without exhibiting any aggregation, precipitation, or phase separation at 4 \u00b0C for 6 months of storage. The LVT release data from all developed solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) and NLCs were best fitted to a Ritger-Peppas kinetic model (0.9832 and 0.9783 for NLCs and SLNs, respectively). This indicated that the release of LVT from the SLNs and NLCs was due to a combination of drug diffusion and erosion from the lipid matrix. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results show that LVT-NLCs were better compared to free drug, which could be attributed to an increase in bioavailability.",

Rhabdomyolysis is a distinctively uncommon presentation of hypothyroidism described usually in the setting of precipitating events such as strenuous exercise, alcohol, or statin use. Rarely rhabdomyolysis and myoedema seen in hypothyroidism can be complicated by the development of anterior compartment syndrome leading to neurovascular compression.

The number of high-risk plaques was significantly reduced in the atorvastatin group compared with the placebo group: change in number of low attenuation plaques -0.2 (95% CI -0.6 to 0.2) versus 0.4 (0.0, 0.7; p=0.03; n=37); and change in number of positively remodelled plaques -0.2 (-0.4 to 0.1) versus 0.4 (-0.1 to 0.8; p=0.04; n=37). Direct LDL-cholesterol (-1.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.38 to 0.61 vs 0.30 mmol/L, 0.04 to 0.55, p<0.0001) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (-52.2 ng/mL, 95% CI -70.4 to -34.0, vs -13.3 ng/mL, -32.8 to 6.2; p=0.005; n=37) decreased significantly with atorvastatin relative to placebo.

Now, we aimed to evaluate the existence of a gender effect on classical disease markers and oxidative stress parameters and on the effectiveness of metformin and/or statins in reducing CV risk in poorly controlled type 2 diabetics with and without complications. Our results show that diabetics with complications had higher plasma levels of FRAP, SOD and hs-CRP than those without complications, with FRAP and SOD found increased in both genders. Interestingly, male and female patients with complications had higher plasma levels of hs-CRP and MDA respectively, over patients without complications. Multivariate analysis indicated metformin and statin treatments effective in reducing plasma hs-CRP only in female and not in male diabetics with complications. In these latter females, a positive correlation between hs-CRP and triglycerides (TG) levels was found suggesting a causal relationship between them. Statin treatment was effective in reducing MDA in diabetics with complications irrespective of the gender. These data support the addition of statins to diabetic standard therapy to control oxidation injury and inflammation and, for the first time, indicate female patients with complications more responsive than males to the CV protection offered by metformin.", 
    "154": "Exercise may be an important treatment for hypercholesterolemic patients, particularly in statin users who are at increased diabetes risk. We therefore used Cox proportional hazard analyses to compare running and walking dose (metabolic equivalent hours/day [MET-h/d]) to diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in hypercholesterolemic patients. There were 60 diabetic- and 373 CVD-related deaths during a 10.1-year mortality surveillance of 6,688 hypercholesterolemic patients. In addition, there were 177 incident nonfatal diabetes, 815 incident nonfatal hypertensions, and 323 incident nonfatal CVD events during a 6.4-year follow-up of 6,971 hypercholesterolemic patients who supplied follow-up questionnaires. Fatal and nonfatal diabetes risk decreased 26% (p = 0.002) and 19% (p \u22640.0001) per MET-h/d, respectively, and relative to <1.07 MET-h/d decreased 35% (p = 0.19) and 55% (p \u22640.0001), respectively, for 1.8 to 3.6 MET-h/d and 73% (p = 0.02) and 71% (p \u22640.0001), respectively, for \u22653.6 MET-h/d. Fatal and nonfatal CVD risk decreased 8% (p = 0.008) and 3% (p = 0.22) per MET-h/d, respectively, and relative to <1.07 MET-h/d decreased 10% (p = 0.45) and 36% (p = 0.008) for 1.8 to 3.6 MET-h/d, respectively, and 37% (p = 0.009) and 26% (p = 0.10), respectively, for \u22653.6 MET-h/d. Incident hypertension risk decreased 4% (p = 0.01) per MET-h/d, and relative to <1.07 MET-h/d decreased 29% (p = 0.002) for 1.8 to 3.6 MET-h/d and 31% (p = 0.001) for \u22653.6 MET-h/d. In conclusion, running and walking for exercise lowers diabetes, hypertension, and CVD risk in hypercholesterolemic patients and should more than compensate for the purported 9% increase in diabetes risk from statin use. By preventing morbidity and mortality for a specific existing medical condition, some exercise expenses may qualify for flexible spending account expenditures in hypercholesterolemic patients when prescribed by a physician.", 
    "155": "Oncogenic Ras proteins are a driving force in a significant set of human cancers and wildtype, unmutated Ras proteins likely contribute to the malignant phenotype of many more. The overall challenge of targeting activated Ras proteins has great promise to treat cancer, but this goal has yet to be achieved. Significant efforts and resources have been committed to inhibiting Ras, but these energies have so far made little impact in the clinic. Direct attempts to target activated Ras proteins have faced many obstacles, including the fundamental nature of the gain-of-function oncogenic activity being produced by a loss-of-function at the biochemical level. Nevertheless, there has been very promising recent pre-clinical progress. The major strategy that has so far reached the clinic aimed to inhibit activated Ras indirectly through blocking its post-translational modification and inducing its mislocalization. While these efforts to indirectly target Ras through inhibition of farnesyl transferase (FTase) were rationally designed, this strategy suffered from insufficient attention to the distinctions between the isoforms of Ras. This led to subsequent failures in large-scale clinical trials targeting K-Ras driven lung, colon, and pancreatic cancers. Despite these setbacks, efforts to indirectly target activated Ras through inducing its mislocalization have persisted. It is plausible that FTase inhibitors may still have some utility in the clinic, perhaps in combination with statins or other agents. Alternative approaches for inducing mislocalization of Ras through disruption of its palmitoylation cycle or interaction with chaperone proteins are in early stages of development.", 
    "156": "The main aim of this study was to test the hypothesis whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels <50 nmol/L at baseline could predict statin-induced myopathy during the course of treatment. In addition, we analysed the association between a genetic polymorphism in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the risk of statin-induced myopathy. We used serum samples from a prospective, observational study in statin-treated patients in Sweden who were thoroughly followed with interviews and questionnaires regarding muscular symptoms (n = 127). In this cohort, 16 developed muscular symptoms and 111 had no muscular symptoms associated with statin treatment during the first year of follow-up. Patients with 25OHD levels <50 nmol/L before starting on statin treatment had four times higher risk of developing muscular symptoms compared with individuals having 25OHD levels >50 nmol/L (RR 4.2; 95% CI 1.7-10.2; p < 0.01). The mean levels of 25OHD at baseline were 50 \u00b1 4 nmol/L among patients developing myopathy and 60 \u00b1 2 nmol/L among patients without myopathy (p < 0.01). Individuals homozygous for the C allele in the VDR polymorphism TaqI (rs731236) had a four times higher risk of developing muscular symptoms; (RR 4.37, 95% CI 1.9-10.1, p < 0.01). In conclusion, 25OHD levels <50 nmol/L might be a useful marker to predict muscular adverse events during statin treatment. In addition, the finding that the VDR polymorphism TaqI was associated with myopathy may indicate a causal relationship between vitamin D function and myopathy, but larger studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.",

    "161": "There are significant differences in coronary heart disease (CHD) in women whenever a comparison is made to men and these carry over to revascularization procedures including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The coronary arteries of women are smaller, which presents additional challenges for PCI and CABG procedures. Unique atypical symptomatology in response to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in women can confound diagnosis, women notoriously delay seeking medical help for ACS, and physicians and other caregivers have had a tendency to minimize the significance of these symptoms, contributing further to a delay in necessary care. There also appears to be an increased association of inflammation and CHD in women. The younger the female patient with CHD, the higher the mortality and that mortality clearly exceeds that of comparable male patients. For cardiovascular (CV) risk prevention in women, statins have had controversy associated with their use but overall, the proof of beneficial outcomes results from statins is also valid in women. An increased rate of adverse outcomes has been reported in women after PCI and CABG surgery. These worse clinical outcomes have persisted in contemporary years but lessened due to advancement in invasive techniques. Nevertheless, PCI that could improve clinical outcomes in women who have high-risk ACS is, unfortunately, performed on a less frequent basis and, in addition, there are greater delays involving women as compared to men. With increased clinical comorbidity associated with complex CHD in women, a lower anatomical SYNTAX score (from: SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXus and cardiac surgery [SYNTAX] trial) appears necessary in order for women to achieve a similar long-term mortality benefit from CABG surgery as compared to PCI.",

The Expert Panel of these guidelines could find no data supporting the routine use of nonstatin drugs combined with statins to further reduce cardiovascular events. Since these guidelines were published, a double-blind randomized trial of 18,144 patients with an acute coronary syndrome demonstrated at a 7-year follow-up that the incidence of cardiovascular events was 34.7% in patients randomized to simvastatin plus placebo versus 32.7% in patients randomized to simvastatin plus ezetimibe (hazard ratio = 0.936; P = 0.016).

Additionally we assessed a treat-all strategy in which all individuals were prescribed either moderate-dose or high-dose statins and all males received low-dose aspirin.

ACC/AHA guidelines were more cost-effective than ATP III guidelines for both men and women despite placing 8.7 million more people on statins.

Primer and probes were synthesized using Universal Probe Library (UPL, Roche) software, and expression levels of genes were tested via qPCR using the device LightCycler 480 II (Roche). Consequently, fluvastatin dose-dependently inhibited migration induced by TGF-\u03b21 in both groups.

The North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) have shown that symptomatic carotid stenosis greater than 70% is best treated with CEA. In asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis greater than 60%, CEA was more beneficial than treatment with aspirin alone according to the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis (ACAS) and Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial (ACST) trials. When CAS is compared with CEA, the CREST resulted in similar rates of ipsilateral stroke and death rates regardless of symptoms. However, CAS not only increased adverse effects in women, it also amplified stroke rates and death in elderly patients compared with CEA. CAS can maximize its utility in treating focal restenosis after CEA and patients with overwhelming cardiac risk or prior neck irradiation. When performing CEA, using a patch was equated to a more durable result than primary closure, whereas eversion technique is a new methodology deserving a spotlight. Comparing the three major treatment strategies of carotid stenosis has intrinsic drawbacks, as most trials are outdated and they vary in their premises, definitions, and study designs. With the newly codified best medical management including antiplatelet therapies with aspirin and clopidogrel, statin, antihypertensive agents, strict diabetes control, smoking cessation, and life style change, the current trials may demonstrate that asymptomatic carotid stenosis is best treated with best medical therapy.

    "192": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, degenerative muscle disease with no effective treatment. DMD muscle pathogenesis is characterized by chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. Statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs, inhibit these deleterious processes in ischemic diseases affecting skeletal muscle, and therefore have potential to improve DMD. However, statins have not been considered for DMD, or other muscular dystrophies, principally because skeletal-muscle-related symptoms are rare, but widely publicized, side effects of these drugs. Here we show positive effects of statins in dystrophic skeletal muscle. Simvastatin dramatically reduced damage and enhanced muscle function in dystrophic (mdx) mice. Long-term simvastatin treatment vastly improved overall muscle health in mdx mice, reducing plasma creatine kinase activity, an established measure of muscle damage, to near-normal levels. This reduction was accompanied by reduced inflammation, more oxidative muscle fibers, and improved strength of the weak diaphragm muscle. Shorter-term treatment protected against muscle fatigue and increased mdx hindlimb muscle force by 40%, a value comparable to current dystrophin gene-based therapies. Increased force correlated with reduced NADPH Oxidase 2 protein expression, the major source of oxidative stress in dystrophic muscle. Finally, in old mdx mice with severe muscle degeneration, simvastatin enhanced diaphragm force and halved fibrosis, a major cause of functional decline in DMD. These improvements were accompanied by autophagy activation, a recent therapeutic target for DMD, and less oxidative stress. Together, our findings highlight that simvastatin substantially improves the overall health and function of dystrophic skeletal muscles and may provide an unexpected, novel therapy for DMD and related neuromuscular diseases."
