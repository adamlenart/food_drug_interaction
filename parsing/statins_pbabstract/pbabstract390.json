The effects of the drugs were also studied in a sitosterolemic patient who has had increased plasma levels of plant sterols. Plasma cholesterol levels determined by the HPLC method were decreased significantly after administration of pravastatin. Plasma plant sterol (sitosterol and campesterol) as well as cholestanol concentrations were also significantly reduced. Cholestyramine administration decreased plasma levels of cholesterol, but did not change those of plant sterols in the hypercholesterolemic subjects. Pravastatin had little effect in a sitosterolemic patient on plasma levels of sterols, where cholestyramine decreased the plasma levels of both cholesterol and cholestanol. These results indicate that treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor decreases plasma plant sterol concentrations, and suggest that the increased plasma plant sterol levels in sitosterolemia might not be due to the decreased cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo.",

About 5% of patients with coronary heart disease have FH. Treatment options include dietary therapy, weight optimization, exercise, and drug treatment. A case study of a patient who has undergone 4 years of treatment for FH after a diagnosis of coronary heart disease is presented.

    "2": "1. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) appears to have a crucial role in cellular proliferation induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). However, the mode of activation of the enzyme has been unclear so far. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a cholesterol lowering drug on [3H]-thymidine ([3H]-TdR) incorporation and PI3K activity in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) stimulated with PDGF. 2. PDGF stimulated both [3H]-TdR incorporation and PI3K activity immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine antibody in a dose dependent manner (ED50 was 4 ng/mL for [3H]-TdR uptake and 3 ng/mL for PI3K activity). Lovastatin inhibited serum-stimulated [3H]-TdR incorporation dose dependently. PI3K activity induced by PDGF was also inhibited in a dose dependent manner; however, its activity was 61% at 10(-6) mol/L, 72% at 10(-5) mol/L and 8% at 10(-4) mol/L of the control value. 3. These inhibitory effects of lovastatin were completely abolished by adding 1 mmol/L mevalonic acid (MVA), suggesting that MVA metabolites had some important role on the PI3K activation and cellular proliferation. 4. Fluoromevalonate (Fmev), a competitive inhibitor of mevalonate diphosphate (MVA-PP) decarboxylase, inhibited [3H]-TdR incorporation at concentrations more than 10(-6) mol/L. Moreover, marked inhibitory effect was observed at concentrations of 10(-7) and 10(-8) mol/L (76% of control). PI3K activity was also reduced by 10(-3) mol/L Fmev (0.2% of control). However, in contrast to [3H]-TdR uptake, there was no inhibitory effect detected at concentrations up to 10(-4) mol/L. 5. These results suggest that PDGF-stimulated PI3K activity as well as cellular proliferation was modified by protein isoprenylation.", 
    "3": "1. To investigate the effect of endogenous cholesterol synthesis on blood pressure and vascular response, a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin (1 or 10 mg/kg) was administered orally for 2 or 4 weeks to 8-13 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR/Izm) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY/Izm) rats. 2. Blood pressure was significantly increased in the pravastatin-treated groups of both strains, but the elevation was observed in WKY after a longer treatment than in SHR. 3. After the thoracic aorta from 10-12 week old SHR and WKY was pretreated with pravastatin (10(-4) mol/L), the vascular response to norepinephrine was increased in pravastatin-treated SHR aorta but not in the WKY aorta in both contractivity and sensitivity. 4. These experiments suggest that the vascular response is affected by intracellular cholesterol synthesis pathway.", 
    "4": "Recently, we provided in vitro and in vivo evidence that several vastatins with different potencies decrease arterial smooth-muscle cell (SMC) proliferation independently of their hypocholesterolemic properties. In this study, the in vivo dose-dependent antiproliferative activity of fluvastatin on neointimal formation induced by the insertion of a collar around one carotid artery was investigated in normocholesterolemic rabbits (five animals per treatment group). Intraperitoneal fluvastatin treatment progressively inhibited intimal to medial tissue ratios (I/M) by 5, 48, and 64% versus controls at doses of 3, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day, respectively. Local arterial delivery by an Alzet pump of mevalonate (8 mg/kg/day) at the site of collar placement fully prevented a fluvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) inhibitory effect on both I/M and SMC proliferation, as assessed by direct incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into replicating DNA. The results suggest that vastatins exert a direct antiproliferative effect on intimal myocytes beyond their effects on plasma lipids, probably through local inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis.", 
    "5": "In the last decade, the number of patients undergoing heart transplantation has steadily increased as a result of expanding indications for cardiac transplantation. The limitation on the number of transplants performed has been the number of donor organs available. At UCLA, 511 heart transplant procedures were performed from 1984-1994. The mean number of rejection episodes and infections per patient in the first year after transplant was 1.1+/-1.3 and 1.0+/-1.2, respectively. Actuarial one-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were 84%, 77% and 73%, respectively. Survival of patients age 60 years and over (n=105) was comparable to that of patients under age 60. Despite transplanting more critically ill patients (Status 1) and having longer cold ischemic times, outcomes have been improving. We have been pursuing corticosteroid-free immunosuppression, which no doubt has led to the decrease in infection complications. Furthermore, our work with pravastatin early after transplantation has led to a decrease in clinically severe rejection episodes which has translated into improved survival. Pravastatin also appeared to decrease the development of transplant coronary artery disease and appeared to have an adjunct immunosuppressive effect in our heart transplant patients on CsA-based immunosuppression. Future studies will include the use of mycophenolate mofetil which has properties against B-lymphocytes in addition to T-lymphocytes to block both humoral and cellular rejection. Our program continues to seek better ways to improve survival and the quality of life of our patient population.", 
    "6": "Hyperlipidemia is not only a prominent complication of nephrotic syndrome, but it may also contribute to the further non-immunologic damage of glomeruli. Analogy between atherosclerosis and glomerular sclerosis was suggested. Treatment of hyperlipidemia may decrease proteinuria in nephrotic animals and subjects and possibly prevent the progression of glomerulosclerosis and renal failure. We decided to study the influence of therapy with the inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, lovastatin, on the development of the experimental nephrotic syndrome induced by the administration of adriamycine in rats.", 
    "7": "Nephrotic syndrome was induced in rats by the intravenous administration of adriamycine. One group of animals was treated from the time of adriamycine adminstration with lovastatin. Lovastatin was also given to one group of control animals. Proteinuria increased significantly during 4 weeks in untreated adriamycine rats (from 0.93 + 0.57 to 12.76 + 11.95 g/mmol of urinary creatinine, p < 0.01), but it did not change significantly in adriamycine rats treated with lovastatin (from 0.98 + 0.69 to 1.90 + 4.25 g/mmol of creatinine, p = n.s.) and it was significantly lower than in untreated animals (p < 0.01). Plasma albumin decreased 12 weeks after adriamycine administration in untreated rats (from 21.16 + 1.45 to 10.58 + 3.83 g/l, p < 0.001) significantly more (p < 0.05) than in rats treated with lovastatin (from 20.01 + 2.18 to 15.34 + 2.66 g/l, p < 0.01). Lovastatin also ameliorated the increase of plasma cholesterol and eliminated the increase of plasma triglycerides in adriamycine rats. Metabolic changes were in all groups characterized by the increase of free fatty acids, possibly due to exaggerated lipolysis, but without significant change of glycaemia and plasma urea. Proteinuria was decreasing at the end of the observed period. Histologically there were only minimal changes in glomeruli, without significant glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "8": "Administration of lovastatin prevented the development of nephrotic syndrome in experimental adriamycine nephropathy in rats. This finding suggests the possible role of hyperlipidemia in the pathogenesis of glomerular damage and suggests the posibility to prevent glomerulosclerosis and renalisufficiency in some form on nephrotic syndrome by the effective hypolipidemic therapy.", 
    "9": "A 60-year-old woman was treated postoperatively for carcinoma of the gall bladder with a split course of radiotherapy. The tumour dose (TD) was 61.2 Gy in 34 fractions delivered by an anterior and two lateral wedge fields with 60Co; the Dmax was 70% of TD for the anterior field and 150% of the TD at the thin edge of the wedges. She also underwent 5-FU and leucovorin chemotherapy. No skin reaction was seen during radiotherapy or in 1 year of follow-up. A year after radiotherapy she was treated for hypercholesterolaemia by simvastatin. Within 2-3 days a severe skin and subcutaneous reaction developed in the lateral radiation fields but not in the anterior field. To our knowledge, recall of skin radiation reaction after simvastatin therapy has not been previously reported.", 
    "10": "The effectiveness of plasma lipid lowering in the clinic is well supported by a growing number of contributions, indicating the significant improvement in cardiovascular risk in primary and particularly in secondary prevention. While these studies have clearly indicated that the more potent agents for cholesterol reduction can provide a very effective help, other pathways of lipid metabolism have gained interest. These should be evaluated, in the hope of providing a more complete answer to the question of regulating lipid absorption, distribution, and tissue deposition. In addition to newer more potent systemic lipid-lowering drugs (in particular hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors), nonsystemic agents, including cholesterol sequestrants, are receiving attention. Some of these are effective at low concentrations, thus providing a potentially powerful tool for plasma cholesterol regulation. Another area of development is that of acyl coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitors, i.e., drugs interfering with cholesterol esterification in tissues, particularly in the arterial wall; the major problem with these seems to be that of poor tolerability and of lack of definitive proof of plasma cholesterol reduction in humans. At present, drugs for the treatment of elevated lipoprotein(a) levels are not available, with few exceptions; in this case, a better understanding of the regulation of lipoprotein(a) metabolism and of the potential benefit of treatment seems necessary. Elevation of congenitally low high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels may also be an important target: microsomal enzyme inducers have been tested, but have not provided a clinically significant response; drugs with a mixed endocrine-hypolipidemic activity possibly may prove effective. Other targets, e.g., the correction of the lipoprotein pattern characterized by \"small low density lipoprotein,\" and the development of drugs specifically acting on the cholesteryl ester transfer protein and lipoprotein lipase systems, are being explored. Finally, new areas of development are in recombinant apolipoproteins (apo's) and in gene therapy. One case, i.e., that of apo A-I/HDL, is entering the clinical field; the mutant apo A-IMilano might provide help because of a combined cholesterol removing/fibrinolytic activity. In the case of gene therapy, at present, data on low density lipoprotein receptor replacement are encouraging. Further options, such as gene transfer in the arterial wall to induce vascular protection/disobliteration of occlusions, are also being tested.", 
    "11": "The efficacy, tolerability and safety of simvastatin was compared to that of bezafibrate in a randomized placebo controlled double-blind trial including 64 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dl and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol above 195 mg/dl. During a placebo period of four weeks patients were counselled for a diet low in cholesterol (< 300 mg/day) and saturated fat (< 10% of calories). This period was also used for randomization of the individuals into the bezafibrate and simvastatin group, respectively. Patients assigned to bezafibrate treatment took bezafibrate at 600 mg/day throughout the entire 12 weeks of active treatment. Patients assigned to simvastatin took simvastatin at 10 mg/day when LDL-cholesterol was below 195 mg/dl, and at 20 mg/day when LDL-cholesterol was above 195 mg. To compare the lipid lowering effect of both substances total cholesterol, LDL- and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol were measured as well as triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol and the concentrations of apolipoproteins (apo)-AI, apo-AII and apo-B, respectively. These variables were compared between the two study groups with respect to the percentage change from baseline levels obtained during the placebo period. After a 12 week treatment period mean percent reduction of total cholesterol in the simvastatin group was 24% and that of LDL-cholesterol was 36%, both more pronounced than the respective reductions (14% and 17%) observed in the bezafibrate group. The mean percent increase in HDL-cholesterol was similar in both treatment groups (simvastation by 20% vs. bezafibrate by 17%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "12": "When used as treatment for hypercholesterolemia HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors will first pass through and act upon the gut mucosa. Although cholesterol availability is essential for cell growth of the intestinal mucosa adverse intestinal events are rare which is possibly due to hitherto undefined compensatory mechanisms. In the present work we therefore studied the long-term influence of mevinolin on proliferation and differentiation of CaCo-2 cells as an enterocyte model and their response upon the cholesterol supply of different origin. Mevinolin caused a marked and dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation, microvilli length and alkaline phosphatase. This parallel suppression was reversed by the addition of either exogenous free cholesterol, endogenous cholesterol from mevalonolactone or LDL but not HDL3. Surprisingly, sucrase activity reacted in an inverse fashion to alkaline phosphatase activity. Mevinolin induced enzyme activity and this was further enhanced by mevalonolactone supply, while cholesterol and LDL normalized sucrase to controls. In conclusion, the presence of luminal cholesterol as well as plasma LDL as the cholesterol source for the enterocyte may prevent mevinolin toxicity.", 
    "13": "This study investigated the preventive effect of pravastatin on restenosis following successful transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA) in 109 consecutive patients. Patients were randomly and prospectively assigned to the pravastatin group (group P, n = 57) or the control group (group C, n = 52). The former received 10 mg/day pravastatin from the day of PTCA for 3 months. Restenosis was defined as a > or = 50% diameter stenosis at follow-up angiography with a > or = 15% reduction in luminal diameter compared to post-PTCA. The effect of pravastatin was analyzed in association with 7 clinical and 15 angiographic factors. Follow-up rate, serum lipid levels (total cholesterol, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol), and clinical and angiographic backgrounds except age and angularity of the lesions were not significantly different between the two groups at PTCA. Three months later, total cholesterol decreased from 222.3 +/- 35.1 to 179.2 +/- 31.2 mg/dl in group P, but was unchanged in group C (from 226.0 +/- 33.7 to 211.7 +/- 30.9 mg/dl). The restenosis rate was not different between the two groups (35.6 vs 35.7% per patient, 32.0 vs 33.3% per lesion). Moreover, no relationship between restenosis rate and serum total cholesterol level at follow-up angiography was observed. Multivariate analysis, including 7 clinical and 15 angiographic factors, found neither pravastatin administration nor serum lipid levels were significantly correlated with decreased luminal diameter. Pravastatin (10 mg/day) did not reduce the incidence of restenosis after PTCA when administered from the day of PTCA for 3 months.", 
    "14": "The proliferation of normal non-tumourigenic mouse fibroblasts is stringently controlled by regulatory mechanisms located in the postmitotic stage of G1 (which we have designated G1pm). Upon exposure to growth factor depletion or a lowered de novo protein synthesis, the normal cells leave the cell cycle from G1pm and enter G0. The G1 pm phase is characterized by a remarkably constant length (the duration of which is 3 h in Swiss 3T3 cells), whereas the intercellular variability of intermitotic time is mainly ascribable to late G1 or pre S phase (G1ps) (Zetterberg & Larsson (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 5365). As shown in the present study two tumour-transformed derivatives of mouse fibroblasts, i.e. BPA31 and SVA31, did not respond at all, or only responded partially, respectively, to serum depletion and inhibition of protein synthesis. If the tumour cells instead were subjected to 25-hydroxycholesterol (an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3 methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity), their growth was blocked as measured by growth curves and [3H]-thymidine uptake. Time-lapse analysis revealed that the cells were blocked specifically in early G1 (3-4 h after mitosis), and DNA cytometry confirmed that the arrested cells contained a G1 amount of DNA. Closer kinetic analysis revealed that the duration of the postmitotic phase containing cells responsive to 25-hydroxycholesterol was constant. These data suggest that transformed 3T3 cells also contain a 'G1pm program', which has to be completed before commitment to mitosis. By repeating the experiments on a large number of tumour-transformed cells, including human carcinoma cells and glioma cells, it was demonstrated that all of them possessed a G1pm-like stage. Our conclusion is that G1pm is a general phenomenon in mammalian cells, independent of whether the cells are normal or neoplastic.",

Regardless of the mutation type, patients without the PvuII site in the normal LDL-receptor gene (P--subjects) tended to have 6-8% higher serum and LDL-cholesterol levels than patients possessing this restriction site (P+ subjects). Although not statistically significant, this difference is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that reported in three different non-FH populations. Treatment with lovastatin brought about similar hypolipidaemic responses in FH patients with either mutation type (FH Helsinki or FH North Karelia) or PvuII RFLP status (P+ or P-).",

Important nonsterol compounds, such as ubiquinone, are also derived from the same synthetic pathway. Therefore it has been hypothesized that statin treatment causes ubiquinone deficiency in muscle cells, which could interfere with cellular respiration causing severe adverse effects. In this study we observed decreased serum levels but an enhancement in muscle tissue ubiquinone levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia after 4 weeks of simvastatin treatment. These results indicate that ubiquinone supply is not reduced during short-term statin treatment in the muscle tissue of subjects in whom myopathy did not develop.", 
    "23": "The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a recessive inherited disorder characterized by neurologic developmental defects and dysmorphic features in many organs. Recently, abnormal cholesterol biosynthesis with impaired conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol has been discovered in homozygotes. To reproduce the biochemical abnormality, BM 15.766, a competitive inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7-reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol into cholesterol was fed by gavage to rats. After 14 d, plasma cholesterol concentrations declined from 48 mg/dl to 16 mg/dl and 7-dehydro-cholesterol levels rose from trace to 17 mg/dl. Hepatocytes surrounding the central vein developed balloon necrosis. Stimulating cholesterol synthesis with cholestyramine followed by BM 15.766 produced an additional 40% decline (P < 0.05) in plasma cholesterol and 34% increase in 7-dehydrocholesterol levels compared to the inhibitor alone. Adding 2% cholesterol to the diet during the second week of BM 15.766 treatment increased plasma cholesterol threefold and decreased 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations 55%. Hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity increased 73% with a 3.9-fold rise in mRNA levels but cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity decreased slightly though mRNA levels increased 1.4 times with BM 15.766 treatment. These results demonstrate that BM 15.766 is a potent inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol-delta 7-reductase. The model reproduces abnormal cholesterol biosynthesis as seen in the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and is useful to test different treatment strategies. Stimulating early steps of cholesterol synthesis worsens the biochemical abnormalities while feeding cholesterol inhibits abnormal synthesis, improves the biochemical abnormalities and prevents liver damage.", 
    "24": "Lovastatin (LOV), a hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase competitive inhibitor, blocks epidermal growth factor (EGF)- or prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha)-induced mitogenesis in confluent resting Swiss 3T3 cells. This inhibition occurs even in the presence of insulin, which potentiates the action of these mitogens in such cells. LOV exerts its effect in a 2-80 microM concentration range, with both mitogens attaining 50% inhibition at 7.5 microM. LOV exerted its effect within 0-8 h following mitogenic induction. Mevanolactone (10-80 microM) in the presence of LOV could reverse LOV inhibition within a similar time period. LOV-induced blockage of PGF2 alpha response is reflected in a decrease in the rate of cell entry into S phase. Neither cholesterol, ubiquinone, nor dolichols of various lengths could revert LOV blockage. In EGF- or PGF2 alpha-stimulated cells, LOV did not inhibit [3H]leucine or [3H]mannose incorporation into proteins, while tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N' glycosylation, prevented this last phenomenon. Thus, it appears that LOV exerts its action neither by inhibiting unspecific protein synthesis nor by impairing the N' glycosylation process. These findings strongly suggest that either EGF or PGF2 alpha stimulations generate early cell cycle signals which induce mevalonate formation, N' glycoprotein synthesis, and proliferation. The causal relationship of these events to various mechanisms controlling the onset of DNA synthesis is also discussed.", 
    "25": "UT-1 cells, a mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line induced to produce an abundance of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), were used to determine the effects of sterols and brefeldin A on the degradation of this enzyme. Brefeldin A has been shown to cause retention of proteins in and relocation of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). UT-1 cells were incubated with (a) sterols only (12 micrograms/ml cholesterol and 0.2 microgram/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol), (b) sterols and brefeldin A (0.5 microgram/ml), and (c) brefeldin A only. Western blot analysis showed that incubation with sterols and brefeldin A decreased HMGR levels more slowly than incubation with sterols alone over the first 24-36 h of incubation; however, the rates were not significantly different. By 48 h of incubation, HMGR had decreased to a level comparable to that found when cells were incubated in sterols only. Incubation with brefeldin A alone did not cause a decrease in HMGR over the same 48-h time period. HMGR was undetectable in parental CHO cells under all of the conditions described. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a pattern of tight, perinuclear staining with sterol incubation. After 48 h in sterols, HMGR staining was uniformly decreased throughout the cytoplasm. This change in staining pattern is also observed during incubation of UT-1 cells with sterols and brefeldin A. Incubation for 48 h with brefeldin A alone had no effect on the tight perinuclear pattern originally observed. Diffuse, faint staining of CHO cells under all conditions served as a negative control. The results of these experiments indicated that brefeldin A, and therefore retention of proteins in the ER, does not interfere with the degradation of HMG CoA reductase. Despite the presence of brefeldin A, sterol-mediated dispersal and degradation of the crystalloid ER (CER) continued in UT-1 cells. Lack of brefeldin A sensitivity implied that the mechanism for CER dissolution was distinct from previously described mechanisms for ER to Golgi transport.",

    "28": "The frequency of liver function tests in patients using NSAIDs was generally low, although testing was more common in patients who used diclofenac. The probability of liver function testing was higher for patients treated in recent calendar years, for patients treated by rheumatologists, for patients who previously used NSAIDs, and for patients who had undergone a liver function test sometime in the 6 months preceding the onset of therapy.",

    "30": "A total of 96 patients with moderate elevations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were randomly assigned to 4 different double-blind treatment regimens: placebo; colestipol 5 g and lovastatin 20 mg/day (C5 + L20); colestipol 10 g and lovastatin 20 mg/day (C10 + L20); and lovastatin 40 mg/day (L40). During 12 weeks of therapy, C10 + L20 achieved the greatest reduction in total cholesterol (-32%) and LDL cholesterol (-48%) levels from baseline. This combination also exhibited significantly greater reductions in LDL cholesterol levels than the C5 + L20 and L40 groups (p < 0.01). The differences in total and LDL cholesterol reduction between the C5 + L20 and L40 groups were not significant. Similar changes and differences between treatments were seen in apolipoprotein B levels. Whereas mean total apolipoprotein A-I levels increased with all treatments (p < 0.05), lipoprotein particles A-I were significantly increased in the C10 + L20 group (p < 0.01) only. Results demonstrate that the combination of low-dose lovastatin (20 mg/day) with low-dose colestipol (5 or 10 g/day) produces LDL cholesterol reductions equal to or greater than higher doses of lovastatin (40 mg/day). In addition, low-dose combinations are > 25% more cost-effective than high-dose monotherapy.", 
    "31": "Competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase are currently used to treat patients with hypercholesterolaemia. These inhibitors affect not only cholesterol biosynthesis, but also the production of non-steroidal mevalonate derivatives, that are involved in a number of growth-regulatory processes. As a consequence, their potential use as anticancer drugs has been suggested. In order to examine long-term effects of this potential therapeutic approach, we cultivated the gastric carcinoma cell line, EPG85-257, and the breast tumour cell line, MDA-MB231, in the presence of increasing concentrations of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin. For both cell lines, this procedure led to the selection of resistant variants able to proliferate in more than 1000 microM inhibitor. By competitive reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction assay (cRT-PCR), the expression of the mRNA for two key proteins of cellular cholesterol metabolism, HMG-CoA reductase and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, were analysed in sensitive and resistant cells. Despite similar growth rates, MDA-MB231 cells expressed approximately four times more HMG-CoA reductase mRNA than EPG85-257 cells and over 30 times more LDL receptor mRNA. Both mRNA species were coordinately regulated in the parental and in the pravastatin-resistant variant cells. Expression was highly stimulated (3- to 4-fold for the HMG-CoA reductase and 2- to 3-fold for the LDL receptor) in the resistant variants when cultured in lipoprotein-deficient medium in the presence of 1000 microM pravastatin. Immunocytological analysis of the expression of the HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor protein were in accordance with the data on specific mRNA expression obtained by cRT-PCR. Southern blot analysis revealed a 1.5-fold amplification of the HMG-CoA reductase gene in resistant MDA-MB231 cells, but not in the resistant EPG85-257 variant. Our data provide evidence for resistance mechanisms to pravastatin that are independent of the amplification of the HMG-CoA reductase gene. By analogy to the cell-culture models employed in this study, it is conceivable that similar mechanisms might occur in human tumour cells in vivo during long-term treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. This might limit their application as chemotherapeutic anticancer agents.",

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased by 9% in both groups. All of these changes were significant (P < 0.001) except for triglycerides changes in non-diabetic patients, where the change was not significant and no significant differences were observed between the two groups. These favorable effects on LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were not influenced by gender, the type of diabetic therapy, baseline hemoglobin A1c levels and by the presence of hypertension or gross proteinuria, although a decrease in the two variables were less in those with body mass index > or = 26.4 kg/m2 or in those with age < 60 years. Adverse experiences were similar between treatment groups and the drug was well tolerated. Only one diabetic patient was withdrawn from the study because of pruritus. Pravastatin produced no change in fasting plasma glucose concentrations and hemoglobin A1c levels in diabetic patients throughout the study. Pravastatin was generally effective in improving the serum lipids of hypercholesterolemic diabetic patients.", 
    "34": "Serum depletion of exponentially growing normal human fibroblasts resulted in a moderate depression of the activity of HMG-CoA reductase which occurred simultaneously to the onset of growth arrest of the cells. Specific inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase using mevinolin also resulted in growth arrest. PDGF counteracted the suppressive effect of serum depletion on HMG-CoA reductase activity and cell growth. The growth inhibitory effect of serum depletion and mevinolin was correlated to a decreased biosynthesis of dolichols, in particular of dolichol-20. If PDGF was present in the serum-free medium a high rate of dolichol synthesis was maintained. This effect was mediated not only through an increased HMG-CoA reductase activity. PDGF also increased the incorporation of mevalonate into dolichols, once again into dolichol-20 in particular. In contrast to HDF, the growth of virus-transformed human fibroblasts was not decreased following serum depletion. This was correlated to a sustained activity of HMG-CoA reductase and a sustained dolichol-20 synthesis. In order to block growth and dolichol synthesis of the transformed fibroblasts a stronger inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity was required than in the normal cells. Conditioned medium isolated from the transformed cells was found to maintain a high growth rate and a high HMG-CoA reductase activity in serum-depleted HDF. In addition, the incorporation of mevalonate into dolichols was increased. The present data raise the possibility that PDGF or related factors, through autocrine loops, may contribute to the maintenance of a high dolichol synthesis in tumor cells.", 
    "35": "A new animal model of hyperlipidemia is being developed using the nonionic surfactant poloxamer 407 (P-407). We investigated the impact of pravastatin on P-407-induced hyperlipidemia. Twenty rats received P-407 300 mg intraperitoneally to induce hyperlipidemia, and 20 control rats received saline injection. Pravastatin was administered orally to an equal number of rats in both groups using three different regimens. A fourth group did not receive pravastatin. At 24 hours after injection, total cholesterol levels in two of the pravastatin groups were 28% and 34% lower than those in animals that did not receive pravastatin (p < or = 0.01). At 48 hours, triglyceride levels were significantly lower in all pravastatin groups (21-44%) versus animals not receiving pravastatin. Pravastatin diminished the effects of P-407 on lipoproteins. This new animal model may be useful in screening for investigational antihyperlipidemic agents.", 
    "36": "Lamin A is synthesized in the cytoplasm as a precursor bearing a carboxyl-terminal CaaX box or isoprenylation signal. This precursor is post-translationally processed through multiple steps: isoprenylation with a farnesyl residue on the cysteine of the CaaX box, proteolytic removal of the last three amino acids, carboxymethylation of the cysteine residue and, finally, proteolytic removal of 15 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus. This last step gives rise to mature lamin A from which the isoprenylated terminus has been removed. Isoprenylation is a prerequisite for all other steps of processing. The subcellular location of these processing steps for lamin A is still a matter of debate. We have produced an antibody specific to the 18 amino acid carboxyl terminus of the lamin A precursor that does not recognize mature lamin A. This antibody detects intranuclear foci by immunofluorescence. Larger amounts of lamin A precursor were accumulated by treating cells with mevinolin (MVN), an inhibitor of isoprenoid synthesis. In MVN-treated cells, the lamin A precursor accumulated most strikingly in the peripheral nuclear lamina where it was assembled, while intranuclear foci were maintained. The addition of an excess of mevalonate (MVA), which restores isoprenylation activity, to MVN-treated cells led to a progressive disappearance of the lamin A precursor from the peripheral lamina. This process was completed after 4 hours of MVA treatment, after which the lamin A precursor was restricted to intranuclear foci. We conclude from these results that the non-isoprenylated lamin A precursor appears competent for assembly into the peripheral nuclear lamina, and that all the processing steps leading to mature lamin A can occur within the nuclear space.", 
    "37": "Activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of steroids and polyisoprenoids in mammalian cells, has been detected in both the bloodstream form and the culture-adapted procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei (3.7 +/- 0.6 and 12.7 +/- 1.8 pmol mevalonate produced min-1 (mg cell protein)-1, respectively). The enzyme activity is enriched 6-fold in microsomal fractions. Several competitive inhibitors of mammalian HMG-CoA reductase, including synvinolin (simvastatin), inhibit the multiplication of both forms of trypanosome in vitro (IC50, approx. 25-50 microM after 2-3 days). This growth inhibition is potentiated by agents interfering with the exogenous supply of cholesterol, such as antibodies blocking the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, or 5 microM chloroquine. Conversely, growth inhibition by synvinolin can be largely reverted either by 300 nM LDL or by products of the mevalonate pathway, such as 20 mM mevalonate and in procyclics by 100 microM squalene or cholesterol. In procyclics, low concentrations of synvinolin selectively inhibit the incorporation of [14C]acetate into sterols, but not into fatty acids. These results argue for a critical role in trypanosomes of a mevalonate pathway, that is involved in the biosynthesis of sterol and probably of other metabolites. The HMG-CoA reductase activity is decreased 2-fold in procyclics incubated with 4 mM mevalonate and increased 2-fold in the presence of 2.5 microM synvinolin. Synvinolin also upregulates LDL binding up to 4-fold. These data suggest that HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor expression are regulated in T. brucei as in mammalian cells, to ensure sterol homeostasis.", 
    "38": "Lovastatin, widely used to lower cholesterol, is a pro-drug that requires metabolic activation through hydrolysis by carboxyesterases. There appear to be at least three distinct esterases in humans capable of catalysing this reaction, one in plasma and two in the liver. The rate of lovastatin hydroxy acid formation was measured as 15.8 pmol.ml-1.min-1 in plasma, 2.13 pmol.mg-1 protein.min-1 in hepatic microsomes and 0.92 pmol.mg-1 protein.min-1 in cytosol. The data suggest that on average the three esterases together are capable of activating about 220 nmol (90 micrograms) lovastatin per minute per person, to which the esterases of plasma, liver microsomes and liver cytosol contribute approximately 18, 15 and 67%, respectively. All three esterases showed evidence of inter-individual variability. In one of 17 livers, both cytosolic and microsomal esterase activity was completely missing, while two other liver specimens lacked one esterase. Such variability must be expected to influence the therapeutic efficacy of the drug, and they might be related to its occasional toxicity.", 
    "39": "The effects of 16 weeks therapy with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Simvastatin 10-20 mg (n = 12) was compared to placebo (n = 13) in 25 euthyreoid males with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and fasting total serum cholesterol above 6 mmol/l. Insulin dependence was defined as a glucagon stimulated C-peptide level less than 0.6 mmol/l. The study was placebo-controlled, double-blind with a parallel group design. Body weight, blood pressure, glycemic control as well as liver enzymes were unchanged and simvastatin was well tolerated by all patients. Ophthalmological slitlamp examination before and at the end of the study period did not show development of new lenticular opacities. Simvastatin decreased serum total cholesterol from 6.7 +/- 1.0 mmol/l (mean +/- SD) to 4.9 +/- 0.4 (p < 0.001 vs. placebo) and LDL-cholesterol from 4.6 +/- 0.7 mmol/l to 2.8 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.001 vs. placebo). HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides remained unaltered. A positive influence on the atherosclerotic process in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus remains, however, to be proven.", 
    "40": "Hypertensive patients with hyperlipidemia are at high risk to develop coronary heart disease (CHD). Chemotherapeutic correction of hyperlipidemia seems most reliable modality to prevent CHD. Hypolipidemic effect and tolerance of leskol (fluvastatin) in dietotherapy-resistant hypercholesterolemia were studied in 74 patients with essential hypertension treated with hypotensive drugs. The patients were included in a multicenter trial. A 12-week course reduced total cholesterol level under 6.2 mmol/l in 59% of the patients, under 5.2 mmol/l in 29% of them. LDLP cholesterol lowered to 3.5% in 34% of the patients. Mean apo B diminished by 23%. There was a 27% decrease in the proportion of atherogenic fraction apo B to antiatherogenic fraction of transport proteins apo A-I. Leskol is well tolerated and effective against hypercholesterolemia, it is safe in relation to side effects and blood biochemistry.", 
    "41": "We used various cultures of embryonic brain cells and a line of immortal astrocytes as in vitro model systems to study the direct effects of the hypolipidemic drug lovastatin on developing human CNS cells. Our data showed that pharmacological concentrations of the drug significantly affected growth and development of neuronal and astroglial cells in serum- and lipid-free media. Lovastatin at concentrations of 0.01-1000 ng/ml effectively inhibited intracellular cholesterol synthesis in primary and immortal astrocytes as well as in glial-neuronal reaggregated cultures. Primary astrocytes were more sensitive to minimal concentrations of the drug than their immortal counterparts and glial-neuronal aggregates. A concentration of 100 ng/ml of lovastatin significantly increased activity of LDL receptors both in primary and immortal astrocytes by about 100% and 50%, respectively (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Proliferation of immortal astrocytes in serum-free medium was entirely inhibited by 100 ng/ml of lovastatin. By contrast, a concentration of 5 ng/ml of lovastatin had no significant effect on cell proliferation. Long-term exposure of human brain explants to 100 ng/ml of lovastatin resulted in detrimental ultrastructural changes in neuronal and glial cells and led to cell death. Our data suggest that lovastatin is neurotoxic to developing brain cells and we propose that its in vivo adverse effects on the CNS may be attributed, at least in part, to its direct influence on human neurons and astrocytes as observed in vitro.", 
    "42": "The effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on the metabolism of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins appear to differ according to the predominant lipoprotein profiles present and the condition being treated. In familial hypercholesterolemia, with isolated low density lipoprotein (LDL) elevations, the LDL-apoB elimination rate is increased by up-regulated LDL-receptors. In familial combined hyperlipidemia where very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL both may be increased and enhanced production of LDL-apoB may be present, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors seem to diminish increased LDL-apoB production. The drug-induced decreases in LDL-apoB production could be due to decreased production of precursor VLDL-apoB or due to decreased conversion of VLDL-apoB to LDL-apoB after enhanced removal of VLDL by up-regulated LDL-receptors. To distinguish between these possibilities, we assessed the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in another condition in which there is both apoB overproduction and accumulation of VLDL and LDL in plasma, the nephrotic syndrome. We used endogenous labeling of apoB with [13C]leucine and a multicompartmental model to calculate the metabolic parameters of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Only subjects with focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) were included, as FSGS is a chronic, very slowly progressive form of nephrotic syndrome. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design was used. Treatment periods of 6 weeks were separated by a 2-week washout period. Of the four men studied, three had high triglyceride levels and four had high cholesterol levels. Lovastatin (20 mg/day) significantly decreased cholesterol (27.6 +/- 6%), LDL-cholesterol (27.6 +/- 9%) and plasma apoB (17.9 +/- 2.9%) (P < 0.01 for all). During the placebo period, calculation of kinetic parameters revealed VLDL-, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL)-, and LDL-apoB overproduction and decreased VLDL-apoB fractional catabolic rate. Lovastatin significantly decreased LDL-apoB production rate in all cases (34.1 +/- 14%, P = 0.03). The decreased LDL-apoB was mainly due to a channelling of LDL precursors away from conversion to LDL (conversion of VLDL to LDL decreased from 80.6 +/- 8.3% to 55.9 +/- 17.2%, P = 0.05). Thus, lovastatin decreased LDL-cholesterol in nephrotic subjects mainly by inhibiting LDL-apoB production from VLDL.", 
    "43": "It is believed that the major mechanisms by which hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors lower plasma cholesterol levels are by inducing hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity and by decreasing apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion by the liver. However, the intestine is also an important cholesterogenic organ and the possibility that this class of drugs may alter lipoprotein secretion by the intestine has not been fully studied. The purpose of the present study was to examine the possible role of cholesterol in regulating apoB secretion by the intestine by testing if the suppression of cholesterol synthesis by the reductase inhibitor lovastatin affected the secretion of apoB by CaCo-2 human intestinal cells. Differentiated post-confluent CaCo-2 cells were incubated for 24-72 h in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 5 microM lovastatin, and the secretion rate of lipids, as well as apoB and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) into the medium, was measured. Lovastatin markedly inhibited the incorporation of [1-14C]acetate into cholesterol for at least 48 h, lowered the content of esterified cholesterol in cells, and reduced their rate of cholesterol secretion. However, under basal conditions lovastatin had no effect on the secretion rate of apoB. After stimulation of apoB secretion by addition of 0.8 mM oleic acid to the medium, lovastatin did not alter apoB secretion in the first 2 days of incubation, but reduced the content of apoB in media from the 3rd day by 30%. This could not be explained by an increase in the rate of LDL degradation. Furthermore, supplementation with mevalonic acid only reversed about one-half of the effect of lovastatin, suggesting that this effect was at least parly nonspecific or unrelated to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. There was also no specific effect of lovastatin on apoAI secretion. When cells were cultured with [1-14C]acetate for 24 or 72 h, the specific activity of cholesterol in medium at the end of the incubation was the same as in cells, suggesting that cholesterol used for lipoprotein secretion was in equilibrium with bulk cellular cholesterol and was not from a segregated compartment derived from newly synthesized cholesterol. This may explain why apoB secretion by CaCo-2 cells was unaffected by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with lovastatin.", 
    "44": "The paper provides evidence and results of using new therapeutical treatment of glomerulonephritis, such as pulse-therapy with cyclophosphane, therapy with angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or that with antihyperlipidemic agents. Based on much experience with pulse-therapy with cyclophosphane (over 100 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) and lupus nephritis), it is concluded that this method is highly effective. Treating 57 patients with ACE inhibitors has shown that in CGN these drugs should be used only when taking into account their antihypertensive effect and capacity of lowering intraglomerular hypertension, as evidenced by the renal functional reserve, and diminishing proteinuria. The long-term (7-12 month) antihyperlipidemic therapy (diet and lovastatin) in 20 patients with CGN accompanied by the nephrotic syndrome caused a significant reduction in the concentration of serum cholesterol and proteinuria, a significant increase in serum albumin levels; remission of the nephrotic syndrome occurred in 9 patients; but better effects were observed in non-inflammatory nephropathies, such as membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and nephrosclerosis.", 
    "45": "Currently available data and clinical observations which suggest that there is a pathogenetic relationship between hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis have provided a concept of the X syndrome, by which hypertensive patients, mainly males, have impaired insulin tolerance along with hyperinsulinemia and concurrent atherogenic disorders of lipid metabolism. The paper discussed the specific pathogenetic mechanisms, clinical manifestations, and prospects for drug correction of the metabolic syndrome. The treatment of arterial hypertension with the calcium antagonist Lomir has indicated there are no negative changes as a control of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the presence of effective correction of arterial hypertension and atherogenic dyslipidemias. With the monotherapy of essential hypertension concurrent with hypercholesterolemia with the alpha 1-adrenoblocker Doxazosin, in addition to the agent's high antihypertensive effects, the authors noted its favourable action on lipid spectral parameters and platelet functional activity. There is abundant evidence for the use of specific hypolipidemic agents in patients with essential hypertensive refractory to current antihypertensive drugs. The data obtained with the use of Lescol (fluvastatin) in patients with hypertensive disease and hypercholesterolemia suggest that by substantially reducing the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and its transport protein apo B does not deteriorate the quality of correction of arterial hypertension in this group of patients.", 
    "46": "Lovastatin, the drug introduced recently to treat hypercholesterolemia and displaying antiproliferative activity against tumor cells in vitro, was used for the local therapy of MmB16 melanoma in mice. Female B6D2F1 mice were injected with 1 x 10(6) of MmB16 melanoma cells into the right hind limb. On the 7th day after the injection of tumor cells mice were divided into four groups and were injected with: (a) saline solution (control group), (b) TNF-alpha alone, (c) lovastatin alone, and (d) a combination of TNF-alpha and lovastatin. Statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in mice treated with both TNF (5 micrograms/day) and lovastatin (200 micrograms/day). We also observed the prolongation of survival of tumor-bearing mice after combined therapy with both TNF-alpha (5 micrograms/day) and lovastatin (1 mg/day) in comparison to all other groups. Our data suggest that lovastatin may synergistically potentiate the antitumor activity of TNF-alpha.", 
    "47": "PLAC 1 is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial assessing the efficacy of monotherapy with an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) in altering the atherosclerotic process. This trial was an angiographic trial undertaken in the United States and was completed in early 1994. Despite the fact that angiographic end-points were the prime focus during the planning and execution of the trial, significant impact was seen in the area of clinical events, particularly fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. The latter were significantly reduced in the treated patients. These results were paralleled by a significant slowing of progression in the treated patients. Importantly, the angiographic effects were predominant in prevention of new lesion formation and in slowing the progression of mild/moderate lesions less than 50% diameter stenosis at baseline. Current concepts suggest that the latter two categories of lesions are the most important in linking angiographic outcomes with clinical events. PLAC 1 is the first trial to concomitantly show statistically significant effects in clinical end points and angiographic end-points in the category of new and/or mild stenoses. These results are compatible with the concept of plaque stabilization.", 
    "48": "Apolipoprotein (a)-Lp(a)-is reported to be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease and for hemodialysis (HD) access occlusion. Homology with plasminogen may predispose to thrombosis. High concentrations usually have been reported in patients on HD and on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), but near-normal values in many kidney transplants (TP). We used Pharmacia immunoradiometric assay in 52 patients on HD, 58 on CAPD, 94 after TP, and 56 controls. The Lp(a) mean levels for CAPD, HD, TP, and control groups were 738, 647, 348, and 368 U/l and the medians were 542, 537, 96 and 143 U/l, respectively. The means and medians for CAPD and HD were significantly greater than those for TP and controls (p < 0.003 for means and < 0.005 for medians). We found no significant difference between: (1) Lp(a) means or medians comparing HD and CAPD or TP and controls; (2) Lp(a) means for the 33 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and the 171 without; (3) number of occlusions of HD fistulae or grafts in patients with high Lp(a) values and without; (4) mean Lp(a) for CAPD patients on gemfibrozil and also for TP patients on 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme 1 reductase inhibitors, or diet alone, before and after treatment, and (5) mean Lp(a) values for HD and CAPD patients with and without myocardial infarction. Lp(a) did not correlate significantly with fractional shortening or left ventricular end systolic or diastolic diameter by echocardiogram or with ejection fraction. For TP patients, Lp(a) and serum creatinine correlated (p = 0.004), and mean Lp(a) for 71 TP on ciclosporin A exceeded that for the other 23 patients (p < 0.03). Lp(a) fell in 13 of 14 patients after TP (mean fall 77%). The dominant Apo(a) isoform in 10 of 13 patients on CAPD or HD with high Lp(a) values was the equivalent of S2 (Utermann). Lp(a) in HD or CAPD is often elevated and regulated by both genetic and renal failure factors, but falls after TP with return of renal function and mainly genetic regulation. Lp(a) was not a risk factor for coronary artery disease in HD or CAPD patients and did not fall significantly with two drugs or diet.", 
    "49": "In the recently reported Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), 4,444 men and women between 35 and 70 years of age who had coronary heart disease and plasma total cholesterol concentrations of 212 to 310 mg per deciliter (5.5 to 8.0 mmol/l) received simvastatin or placebo for 5.4 years; in the treatment group, mortality from coronary heart disease was 42 percent lower and mortality from all causes was 30 percent lower. Further analysis of the relation between the risk of major coronary events and baseline cholesterol levels in patients randomised to placebo or simvastatin therapy in the study showed that simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of major coronary events in all quartiles of baseline total, high-density-lipoprotein, and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, by a similar amount in each quartile. Clearly, cholesterol-modifying interventions can substantially improve the outlook for patients with coronary heart disease and should be considered in identification and treatment of patients with established coronary heart disease. The available data from secondary intervention trials indicates that all patients with documented ischemic heart disease should be offered a reliable assessment of plasma total cholesterol. However, since the impact of simvastatin on CHD seems to begin after about one year of therapy it would be reasonable to exclude very old persons and patients with serious disease with a limited life-expectancy. As a consequence of the 4S data it should be recommended that all the patients in question, who after lifestyle modifications and non-pharmacological risk factor modification still have total cholesterol levels above 200 mg per deciliter (5.2 mmol) should be offered treatment with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Hypercholesterolaemia therapy should begin with implementation of a suitable diet in order to achieve optimum weight and reduce the intake of saturated fats. Often, however, a dietary regime is not sufficient to decrease cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolaemic patients and drugs must also be used. Some of the pharmacological options available act principally on LDL cholesterol, whereas others have more effect on triglyceride rich particle. HMGCoaA reductase inhibitors exert the greatest effect on plasmatic LDL cholesterol levels and are therefore recommended in cases of moderate or severe hypercholesterolaemia, particularly in the secondary prevention of ischaemic cardiopathy. Comparing the three statin drugs, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin, the latter has recently been shown in study 4S to be effective in reducing global and coronary mortality in patients with a history of coronary heart disease. In addition to their action on LDL cholesterol, these drugs also increase HDL cholesterol, reduce triglycerides and have a beneficial effect on some of the fundamental mechanisms involved in the development of arteriosclerosis. Ion-exchange resins moderately reduce cholesterol levels, thus are used in young people or in combination with other drugs when a further reduction of LDL cholesterol is required. Their main drawback, however, is that they can often cause digestive intolerance. Primary prevention trials have shown that fibrates also reduce mortality by coronary heart disease but have no effect on global mortality. They are well tolerated and are used in the treatment of mixed hyperlipaemia. Other products, such as probucol and oestrogens, are also used but only under specific circumstances.",

This work began with a purely biochemical perspective on the mechanism of lanosterol demethylation. The final efforts focused on pharmacology and drug design thus bringing the basic science effort to a practical application. Most recently, a series of 15-oxalanosterols, which act as pure suppressors of HMG-CoA reductase lacking lanosterol demethylase inhibition properties has been identified. These molecules also lower serum cholesterol and show promise as potential agents for clinical evaluation. The utility of these compounds and validation of our hypothesis will have to await further testing.",

This study assesses the effects of this agent on the growth and survival of the human malignant glioma cell lines A172 and U87-MG. The response to the drug was investigated using a cell proliferation assay which revealed significant dose-dependent growth inhibition. Treatment with as little as 100 nM lovastatin over a period of 72 hours led to DNA degradation into nucleosome-sized fragments characteristic of apoptosis. Our data suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin merit further investigation as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of malignant gliomas.", 
    "54": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA metabolism is compartmentalized in mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes. We investigated the subcellular distribution of HMG-CoA lyase (HL), which is found principally in mitochondria but in which we observed the potential peroxisomal targeting motif cysteine-lysine/arginine-leucine at the carboxyl terminus. We used differential and density gradient centrifugation to separate peroxisomes and mitochondria in liver homogenates of outbred CD-1 mice. Peroxisomal fractions contained 6.4% of total HL activity in mouse liver and 5.6% in human liver. Liver peroxisomal HL activity increased 2.3-2.5 times following induction of peroxisomal proliferation by clofibrate administration. Western blotting with anti-human HL antibodies confirmed the presence of immunoreactive HL in peroxisomal fractions. Mouse liver peroxisomal HL is distinct from mitochondrial HL, measuring approximately 2.5 kDa more by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. By fast protein liquid chromatofocusing analysis, the pI of peroxisomal HL is 7.3, in contrast to 6.2 for mitochondrial HL. These results are consistent with noncleavage of the mitochondrial leader peptide in peroxisomal HL. A distinct species of enzymatically active HL exists in peroxisomes and may play a role in HMG-CoA metabolism in that organelle.", 
    "55": "Hyperlipidemia is a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease. We have shown previously that pancreas transplantation (PTX) improves but does not normalize lipids in most PTX recipients. We studied whether pravastatin was effective in treating 10 patients with elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) following PTX. Seven men and 3 women were studied. Six received combined kidney-pancreas transplantations, while 4 received PTX alone. Age at time of PTX was 37.2 +/- 2.2 years (mean +/- SEM), and 4 had established coronary artery disease before PTX. Mean cholesterol (C), LDL-C, triglycerides (TG), and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (HDL-C) were 236 +/- 12, 142 +/- 6, 222 +/- 50, and 49 +/- 4 mg/dl before PTX. The LDL to HDL ratio was 3.0 +/- 0.3. After PTX, excluding the first 45 days, mean C, LDL-C, and HDL-C increased to 278 +/- 10, 178 +/- 7, and 63 +/- 6 mg/dl (all P < or = 0.05), respectively. TG, LDL to HDL ratio, and weight were unchanged. Pravastatin (11.7 +/- 0.8 mg/day, mean +/- SEM) was initiated 250 +/- 53 days after PTX. During therapy, C and LDL-C decreased on average to 231 +/- 10 and 134 +/- 8 mg/dl, respectively (both P < 0.01), while HDL did not change. The decreases in C and LDL-C were unexplained by a decrease in weight, cyclosporine dose or concentration, or increase in serum creatinine. However, prednisone dose decreased over the same interval, so a contribution from this variable cannot be excluded. No evidence of toxicity was identified during therapy. This is one of the first reports demonstrating that pravastatin is a safe and effective treatment for elevated C and LDL-C in patients following PTX. However, pravastatin did not increase HDL or decrease TG, as observed in the nontransplantation setting. Whether pravastatin or any hypolipidemia therapy can prevent cardiovascular events or mortality following PTX remains to be established.",

In this study we determined whether growth of chick ventricular cells in medium supplemented with lipoprotein depleted serum could alter levels of muscarinic receptors and G-protein alpha-subunits and induce a negative chronotropic response to muscarinic stimulation. We further determined whether levels of mRNA coding for muscarinic receptors, G-proteins, and the acetylcholine-sensitive K+ channel were coordinately regulated. Growth of embryonic chick ventricular cells from hearts 14 days in ovo in medium supplemented with lipoprotein depleted serum resulted in a 21 +/- 5% (n = 3, +/- S.E.) increase in muscarinic receptor number as demonstrated by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding and a 4.7 +/- 1.0 (+/- S.E., n = 4)-fold increase in G alpha i2 as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. These changes in receptor and G-protein were associated with a coordinate increase in levels of mRNA coding for the M2 muscarinic receptor, G alpha i2 and the acetylcholine sensitive K+ channel as determined by RNase protection. These increases were reversed by addition of 30 microM mevinolin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Carbamylcholine (0.1 mM) had no effect on beat rate in ventricular cells grown in medium supplemented with fetal calf serum. Cells grown in medium supplemented with lipoprotein depleted serum demonstrated a 40 +/- 8% (+/- S.E., n = 10, p < 0.0001) decrease in beat rate in response to 0.1 mM carbamylcholine which was reversed by the addition of 30 microM mevinolin. These data suggest that, during growth in medium supplemented with lipoprotein depleted serum, a component of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway plays a role in the coordinate induction of mRNAs coding for receptors, G-proteins, and an effector (ion channel) that results in the induction of a parasympathetic response in the ventricular cell characteristic of the atrial phenotype.", 
    "60": "Luminal renarrowing (restenosis) is the major limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and the search for a 'magic bullet' to prevent this apparent biological healing response to vessel injury has thus far been unsuccessful. Large clinical trials using serial quantitative coronary angiography have, however, provided some valuable insight into this area. In particular, the restenosis process may be measured as the loss in minimal luminal diameter from post-PTCA to follow-up angiography, and is essentially ubiquitous and normally distributed. The angiographic outcome of clinical trials can thus be appropriately evaluated using a continuous rather than a categorical approach, which also considerably reduces the number of patients required. Fluvastatin, a synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, has been shown experimentally to reduce the neointimal proliferative response after PTCA, independent of its lipid-lowering action. The FLuvastatin Angioplasty REstenosis trial was designed to evaluate whether fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily, commencing at least 2 weeks before planned PTCA, can reduce luminal loss by 30% from successful PTCA to follow-up angiography at 26 +/- 2 weeks in 730 evaluable patients.", 
    "61": "Recently,both the European Atherosclerosis Society and the US National Cholesterol Education Program have issued revised guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), based on a multitude of recent epidemiological and angiographic studies. Both authorities agree that a target plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is the single most important parameter, this target level being different for primary and secondary prevention. The introduction of statins for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia provides an important tool to enable target LDL-C levels to be reached in most cases of primary prevention. For secondary prevention, however, the target LDL-C levels--2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl)--may be achieved in only a fraction of cases. Others may require the concomitant administration of other cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as bile-acid sequestrants (resins) and/or derivatives of fibric acid (fibrates). The use of statin-fibrate combinations has been discouraged since the report by the US Food and Drug Administration of 12 sporadic cases of myositis or rhabdomyolysis. During the past 5 years, however, 15 linical trials have examined the efficacy and safety of statin-fibrate combinations in a total of 394 patients with a variety of dyslipidaemias. Overall, the combinations were proven to be effective and safe, and the incidence of abnormalities in liver function tests and levels of creatine kinase (CK) was low. A double-blind study has been carried out at the Hadassah University Hospital to examine the efficacy and safety of fluvastatin when combined with either cholestyramine (group 1) or bezafibrate (group 2) for the treatment of 38 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Patients in group 2 showed a reduction in plasma LDL-C levels of 35% and in LDL-C to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio of 45% compared with 32% and 38% respectively in group 1. Both cholestyramine and bezafibrate produced an additional benefit of a 13% reduction in LDL-C levels in comparison with fluvastatin as monotherapy. Biochemical safety analyses revealed no notable abnormalities in liver function tests or levels of CK. It was concluded that fluvastatin-bezafibrate is a very effective synergistic therapy for heterozygous FH and is superior to a fluvastatin-cholestyramine combination.", 
    "62": "Statins are regarded as a well-tolerated class of drugs, particularly when compared with some of the older lipid-modifying agents, which have poor rates of compliance. Despite some early concern, the incidence of lens opacities observed in clinical studies involving statin use is no different from that in a normal ageing population. Similarly, the occurrence of insomnia with lipophilic agents appears to have been overemphasised and is not a clinically significant problem, irrespective of the statin under study. Fluvastatin is the newest representative of this class of agents; it has already been evaluated in thousands of patients who have hyperlipidaemia with and without additional risk factors. In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of the majority of adverse events observed with fluvastatin therapy is no higher than that seen with placebo, with the exception of gastrointestinal disturbances (known to be common to all stains). Nonetheless, the incidence of these effects seen with fluvastatin treatment is noted to be lower than that associated with cholestyramine or fibrate use. Elevations in levels of liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) have been reported with fluvastatin therapy but have led to discontinuation of treatment with the same frequency as with placebo. Elevations in creatine kinase levels as a cause of discontinuing fluvastatin are not more frequent than with placebo. Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have not been reported with fluvastatin therapy, and myalgia does not occur more frequently than with placebo. In terms of drug interactions, fluvastatin does not interfere with the efficacy of antihypertensive agents. In controlled clinical trials, the overall reported discontinuation rate due to adverse events noted with fluvastatin therapy is 3.3%, which is not significantly distingushable from the rate associated with placebo (3.5%)2.", 
    "63": "Fluvastatin is the first synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitor to be approved for clinical use, and has been studied extensively in humans since 1986. It is structurally distinct from the other currently available HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin), leading to unique biopharmaceutical properties relative to the other agents of this class. Absorption of fluvastatin is virtually complete across all species, including man, and is not affected by the presence of food. Systemic exposure is limited, as fluvastatin is subject to first-pass metabolism, and the plasma half-life of the drug is approximately 30 minutes. Some 95% of a single dosage of fluvastatin is excreted via the biliary route, with less than 2% of this being the parent compound. Additionally, there is no evidence of circulating active metabolites or accumulation during chronic dosing. Studies of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin have demonstrated marked reductions in the rate of bioavailability--from 40% to 60%; however, a comparison of fluvastatin administration with the evening meal or at bedtime has revealed no significant differences in the extent of bioavailability (area under the curve) of these two regimens. Furthermore, no significant difference in pharmacodynamic effect (reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) could be ascertained between mealtime dosing and bedtime dosing. The pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin have also been assessed in various demographic groups. Relative to the general population, plasma concentrations of fluvastatin do not vary as a function of either age or gender. In addition, administration to a patient population with hepatic insufficiency resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in both the rate and extent of bioavailability relative to controls. Also, although minimal alterations of fluvastatin clearance in patients with renal insufficiency are anticipated due to limited renal excretion (5%), a study in this patient group is currently underway to examine this further. Interaction studies have been performed with fluvastatin and several drugs with which it might be coadministered. Cholestyramine, an anionic-binding resin, has a considerable effect in lowering the rate and extent of fluvastatin bioavailability. Although this effect was noted even when cholestyramine was given 4 hours prior to fluvastatin, this regimen did not result in diminished efficacy. Further, no effects on either warfarin levels or prothrombin times were observed in a study involving concomitant administration of warfarin and fluvastatin. Moreover, additional interaction studies with niacin and propranolol have not demonstrated any effect on fluvastatin plasma levels, and administration to a patient population chronically receiving digoxin resulted in no difference in the extent of bioavailability of digoxin relative to control data. The results generated to date in clinical pharmacokinetic studies with fluvastatin thus support its use in a broad population of hypercholesterolaemic patients.", 
    "64": "Insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) support the survival and differentiation of many types of neurons, including those from fetal chick forebrain. The mechanisms by which these peptides exert their neurotrophic actions are poorly understood. The aims of this study were to determine if insulin and IGF-I activate p21ras in fetal chick forebrain neurons and if activation of p21ras mediates the neurotrophic actions of these peptides. Activation of neuronal p21ras was examined by measuring the amount of GTP bound to p21ras before and after growth factor treatment. Insulin and IGF-I increased the ratio of GTP/GTP + GDP by 31 +/- 9.0% and 36 +/- 8.0%, respectively, p21Ras activation by insulin and IGF-I was maximal within 5 min. In the presence of insulin the response was sustained out to 180 min, whereas the response to IGF-I decreased significantly by 180 min. Both peptides stimulated p21ras at low concentrations with a maximal response obtained at 10 ng/ml for each peptide, idicating that insulin and IGF-I activate ras by interacting with their homologous receptor. Pretreatment of neurons with lovastatin (2 micrograms/ml), an inhibitor of ras isoprenylation, completely blocked the activation of p21ras by insulin and IGF-I. Lovastatin also blocked the ability of these growth factors to support the survival and differentiation of fetal chick neurons in culture. We conclude that insulin and IGF-I activate p21ras in fetal chick forebrain neurons by increasing the amount of GTP bound to p21ras. The activation of neuronal p21ras is necessary for insulin and IGF-I to promote survival and differentiation in these neurons.", 
    "65": "During hepatic fibrogenesis, Ito cells proliferate, acquire a myofibroblastlike phenotype and synthesize increased amounts of extracellular matrix components. In this study, we have assessed the effects of simvastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, on the growth of human myofibroblastlike Ito cells. Cells were grown from explants of normal human liver and characterized by a positive staining for desmin and smooth muscle alpha-actin. Simvastatin (0.1 to 10 mumol/L) induced a marked dose-dependent decrease of [3H]thymidine incorporation in human Ito cells, whether stimulated by human serum or by purified growth factors. Simvastatin-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was confirmed by nuclear autoradiography and was not explained by a cytotoxic effect. The growth inhibitory effect of simvastatin was specifically due to inhibition of hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase because it was overcome by addition of mevalonic acid, the product of the enzymatic reaction. The reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation was not affected by supplementation of culture medium with purified cholesterol-low-density lipoprotein or isopentenyl adenine. It was partially reversed by addition of farnesol. These results show that simvastatin decreases the growth of human Ito cells, independently of its effect on cholesterol synthesis. This decrease may be due in part either to reduced farnesylation of proteins involved in growth factor signaling pathway or to inhibition of N-linked protein glycosylation. Whether this effect exists in vivo and could thus lead to a parallel decrease of fibrosis deposition within the liver requires further study.", 
    "66": "To establish whether lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, exhibits a specific effect on apolipoprotein (apo) A- and apoB-containing lipoproteins, 63 subjects, a subset of the 270 Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study (MARS) patients with hypercholesterolemia (190 to 295 mg/dL) and documented coronary artery disease, were randomized into either lovastatin 40 mg twice daily or matching placebo tablets twice daily. Both groups consumed a diet containing 27% calories as fat (polyunsaturated fat/saturated fat ratio, 2.85) and a daily cholesterol intake of less than 250 mg. The plasma lipid and apolipoprotein profiles were determined at the time of randomization and after 2 years of treatment, and the levels of apoA- and apoB-containing lipoprotein families were measured after 2 years of treatment. After this treatment period, the drug group was characterized in comparison with the placebo group by significantly reduced levels of total cholesterol (33%), triglycerides (30%), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (36%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (43%), apoB (36%), apoC-III (18%), and apoE (17%) and slightly but insignificantly increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (6%) and apoA-I (1%). The 2-year levels of lipoprotein containing apoA-I but no apoA-II (LpA-I) and lipoprotein containing both apoA-I and apoA-II (LpA-I/A-II) particles separated by immunoaffinity chromatography on an anti-apoA-II immunosorber did not differ between the two treatment groups. However, the apoB-containing lipoprotein (Lp) families defined by apolipoprotein composition and separated by immunoaffinity chromatography on anti-apoA-II and anti-apoC-III immunosorbers were affected in a selective manner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "In an 8-week, placebo-controlled multicenter study, the efficacy of dose levels of simvastatin 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg was evaluated in 166 patients with hypercholesterolemia, of whom 163 completed the trial. The entry criteria were serum total cholesterol (TCHOL) between 6.2 and 7.8 mM and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol between 4.3 and 50 mM on a standard diet and after the 2-week run-in period of placebo treatment. Mean percentage changes in serum lipids in each simvastatin-treated group from baseline were statistically significant. Of treated patients, 0% (placebo), 11% (2.5 mg), 7% (5 mg), 33% (10 mg), 42% (20 mg) and 55% (40 mg) had at least 40% reduction from baseline LDL cholesterol value. After 8 weeks of treatment, 0% (placebo), 11% (2.5 mg), 25% (5 mg), 26% (10 mg), 31% (20 mg), and 55% (40 mg) of patients treated reached a TCHOL level of < or = 5.2 mM. There was a significant linear dose response with regard to the decrease in LDL cholesterol, TCHOL, and triglycerides (TG) and the increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol after 8 weeks of therapy. No serious clinical or laboratory adverse events related to simvastatin were observed even at higher doses. At each dose level, simvastatin reduced TCHOL and LDL cholesterol. Doses of simvastatin > or = 5 mg moderately increased HDL cholesterol and reduced serum TG. Simvastatin therapy resulted in major improvement in serum lipoprotein profile, particularly at higher doses.", 
    "68": "The role of oxysterols as regulatory molecules in the suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was investigated in the intact rat in response to an acute dietary cholesterol challenge. When rats were fed highly purified cholesterol as a single meal at a level of 5% of the diet, maximal inhibition of enzyme activity (66%) occurred 120 min after the completion of the meal. Furthermore, when nonsaponifiable liver extracts were chromatographically resolved and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), 25-hydroxycholesterol was identified in the livers of rats 120 min after the completion of the single cholesterol meal. Significantly, only barely detectable amounts of 25-hydroxycholesterol were observed in the livers from control rats fed a sterol-free diet. The biosynthetic origin of 25-hydroxycholesterol was investigated with the use of deuterated water. Rats were fed deuterium oxide (33%) ad libitum for 3 days and then killed 120 min after the completion of a single cholesterol meal. As before, 25-hydroxycholesterol was detected in the livers from cholesterol-fed rats, but not to a significant extent in livers from control-fed rats receiving a sterol-free diet. Isotope ratio mass spectrometry revealed that the fractional incorporation of deuterium into 25-hydroxycholesterol (21%) was less than that observed for cholesterol (24%) isolated from the same livers, indicating that 25-hydroxycholesterol was produced endogenously from exogenous cholesterol and not from autoxidation of cholesterol. In a separate experiment it was also shown that [3H]mevalonate was incorporated into 25-hydroxycholesterol after a single meal cholesterol challenge, but was barely detected in the livers of control rats. The evidence obtained in the present article supports the hypothesis that 25-hydroxycholesterol is endogenously produced from cholesterol at early time intervals after an acute dietary cholesterol challenge. In addition, rat liver HMG-CoA reductase was inhibited by the administration of a single intragastric dose (1 microgram/kg) of an aqueous solution of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Thus, the results provide strong support for the conclusion that 25-hydroxycholesterol plays a significant role in the in vivo regulation of rat liver cholesterol biosynthesis after an acute dietary cholesterol challenge.", 
    "69": "1. Pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) inhibitor, is a highly selective inhibitor of hepatic cholesterol synthesis. We studied the in vivo and in vitro effects of pravastatin on macrophage cholesterol metabolism. 2. The effects of incubating pravastatin with human monocyte derived macrophages (HMDM), mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPM) and a J-774 A.1 macrophage-like cell line, on macrophage cholesterol synthesis, cellular degradation of native low density lipoprotein (LDL) and modified LDL, cholesterol efflux from these cells and the cholesterol esterification rate were determined. 3. Pravastatin was administered either as one 40 mg dose or 40 mg daily for 8 weeks to normocholesterolaemic and hypercholesterolaemic individuals. The effects on cholesterol synthesis and degradation in monocytes derived from these subjects were studied. 4. In vitro, pravastatin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of macrophage cholesterol synthesis. Cellular degradation of native LDL increased by 119% in the presence of 0.1 mg ml-1 pravastatin. Degradation of both acetyl LDL and oxidized LDL was unaffected. Small concentrations of pravastatin (up to 0.19 micrograms ml-1) increased the cellular cholesterol esterification rate after incubation with LDL, but higher concentrations resulted in an inhibition of the esterification. 5. Single dose pravastatin administration caused a reduction in cholesterol synthesis by the subjects own HMDM by 62% and 47% in normocholesterolaemic and hypercholesterolaemic individuals, respectively. Chronic administration resulted in a 55% inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and a 57% increase in LDL degradation. 6.

    "70": "Statins and fibrates are both effective in the treatment of hyperlipidaemias but are not recommended in combination because episodes of rhabdomyolysis have followed combined lovastatin-gemfibrozil therapy. We assessed treatment with dual bezafibrate-simvastatin therapy in routine clinical practice. In 22 patients, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides fell by 20.1% (P < 0.0001), 35.1% (P < 0.001) and 31% (P < 0.05) respectively, and HDL-cholesterol rose by 18.4% (P < 0.05) on combination therapy. The reduction in cholesterol followed the introduction of simvastatin, while the decrease in triglycerides followed treatment with bezafibrate. No patient developed myopathy. We conclude that dual simvastatin-bezafibrate therapy is well tolerated and may reduce triglyceride concentrations, but offers no advantage in cholesterol reduction over treatment with simvastatin alone.", 
    "71": "\"Is there any safe and optimal treatment of hyperlipidemia following heart transplantation?\" The problem of hypercholesterolemia following heart transplantation if often underestimated. Up to now there is no concept of therapy allowing an optimal adjustment of lipid parameters. Therapeutical trials using ion exchange resins, derivatives of nicotinic acids and fibrates were not successful due to cyclosporine A interaction, hepatotoxicity and limited efficacy of the applied substances. In a prospective, randomized and controlled trial we investigated the effects of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor simvastatin in heart transplant recipients. The study included 70 patients (simvastatin n = 37, control group n = 33). 8 patients died within the first three months following heart transplantation. Purpose of the study was the adjustment of the LDL-cholesterol values in the simvastatin treated group to < or = 110 mg/dl. Following 24 months of treatment a mean LDL-cholesterol plasma level of 110 mg/dl was obtained. The corresponding mean value of the control group was 150 mg/dl. The difference between both groups was significant (p < 0.001). In the same period the mean HDL-cholesterol values increased by approx. 15% in both groups (no significant difference [p > 0.05]). The ratio of LDL/HDL-cholesterol was significant lower in the simvastatin treated group (2.28) than in the control group (2.94) (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in Lp(a) values. No adverse side effects were observed within the observation period of 24 months, particularly no increase in the frequency of rejection episodes. Summarizing the above, we recommend low-dose simvastatin therapy as a safe and optimal treatment of hypercholesterolemia following heart transplantation.", 
    "72": "The discovery and production of HMGCoA reductase inhibitor and the fundamental research work of the LDL receptor unraveled a receptor-mediated cholesterol homeostasis. HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed class of lipid-lowering drugs in many countries. The decrease of the intracellular cholesterol caused by the inhibitor induces the compensatory increase of LDL receptor protein at liver plasma membrane. The increased receptor promotes LDL catabolism and results in decrease of plasma LDL. Serious side effects involving the liver or muscle are rare. But the risk of myopathy is increased when the drug is used with other hypolipidemic agents. A principle of the treatment of hyperlipidemia, including secondary one associated with diabetes mellitus and renal disease, by HMGCoA reductase is discussed in this review.",

Maternal and fetal parameters were evaluated on day 20 (rats) or 29 (rabbits) of gestation. Live fetuses were examined for external, visceral, and skeletal malformations and variations. At 300 mg/kg in rats, 1 treatment-related death occurred on day 12 of gestation, and maternal body weight gain and food consumption were decreased during treatment (43% and 23%, respectively). In addition, 1 animal at 300 mg/kg had total litter resorption. Increased postimplantation loss (not statistically significant) and slightly decreased fetal body weight (statistically significant only in males) were also observed at 300 mg/kg. There were no significant differences between treated and control groups in the incidence of fetal malformations or variations. No maternal or developmental toxicity was observed in rats at 10 or 100 mg/kg. In rabbits, marked maternal toxicity (7 deaths, body weight loss during and after treatment, and decreased food consumption) and abortion occurred at 100 mg/kg. At 50 mg/kg, maternal toxicity (2 deaths and 72% body weight gain suppression) and abortion also occurred. There were no treatment-related effects on live litter size or sex ratio. At 50 and 100 mg/kg, nonstatistically significant increases in postimplantation loss and decreases in gravid uterine weight were observed, and at 100 mg/kg, decreases in fetal body weight were observed relative to controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Continuous administration of pravastatin induced no significant changes in hepatic cholesterol content, ACAT and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities, or bile lipid and acid composition. Abrupt withdrawal of pravastatin induced increases in hepatic cholesterol content and ACAT activity and no change in hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, and increased cholesterol saturation in bile. Hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity paralleled hepatic mRNA levels of this enzyme. These results suggest that a change in hepatic cholesterol metabolism induced by continuous administration of pravastatin maintains a constant net balance of hepatic cholesterol content. In addition, the drug has no deleterious influence on metabolism of bile lipids and acids and related enzymes, except for a transient increase in cholesterol saturation in bile induced by an inappropriate increase in hepatic cholesterol content and a lack of response of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity to changes in hepatic cholesterol content upon abrupt withdrawal of pravastatin.", 
    "79": "Cholesterol synthesis both ex vivo and in vivo in liver and ileum of hamsters was significantly inhibited by fluvastatin. This ex vivo inhibition was considerably lower in fluvastatin-treated hamsters than in fluvastatin-treated rats. In hamsters and rats, fluvastatin was more potent than pravastatin on inhibitory activities of sterol synthesis in liver, but not in the hamster ex vivo. This may indicate that, in part, the hydrophobicity of the fluvastatin molecule confers the selectivity and metabolism in the liver of hamsters and rats to originate from the species differences.",

Response to pravastatin was variable and not correlated to gender, age, or apo E genotype. Gemfibrozil lowered triglycerides by 25% (P < 10(-4)) and raised HDL cholesterol by 11%. The effects of pravastatin on these two interrelated variables were significantly smaller. Both drugs increased Lp(a) significantly by about 10%. The LDL cholesterol lowering effect of pravastatin in patients with FDB is similar to that observed in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "81": "Statin is a 57-kDa protein exclusively expressed in nuclei of nonproliferating mammalian cells. Recent studies have suggested that statin may play a role in the maintenance of growth arrest. Several lines of evidence also support the notion that a variety of genes and gene products are modulated during cell proliferation and cell death. The present study examined the possibility that statin expression could be modulated during neuronal injury using N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA)-induced toxicity to rat embryonic hippocampal cultures as a model. Immunocytochemical studies using a monoclonal antibody to statin revealed a prominent nuclear localization of statin in cultured hippocampal cells. Western blot analysis showed that this antibody recognizes a 57-kDa protein band, indicative of the presence of statin in this preparation. Brief exposure of hippocampal neurons to NMDA (500 microM) produced severe neuronal degeneration over the subsequent hours. NMDA-treated neurons markedly overexpressed statin. Both NMDA-induced neuronal toxicity and statin overexpression were prevented by the NMDA receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d] cyclohept-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801). Interestingly, time course studies indicate that the increased expression of statin observed following NMDA exposure clearly preceded the appearance of the first signs of neuronal death as determined by vital staining. In addition, exposure of hippocampal neurons to the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, produced a marked increase in statin immunodetection, indicating that statin expression is likely regulated in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Thus, these results show that statin, which is expressed at low levels in embryonic rat cultured hippocampal neurons, is rapidly overexpressed following a toxic insult produced by the activation of the NMDA receptor. The observation that statin overexpression occurs prior to neuronal death raises the possibility that the up-regulation of statin could be used as an early index of neuronal injury.",

    "87": "A cost-effectiveness analysis was employed using comparative efficacy data from selected clinical trials. A comprehensive international literature search formed the basis for this selection. Criteria for inclusion of clinical trial results in the analysis were set a priori. Acquisition costs used were the recommended reimbursement prices as at September 1994.", 
    "88": "Two outcome measures are reported: (i) the comparative cost-effectiveness in lowering blood lipid concentrations; and (ii) the comparative cost-effectiveness of the medicines when used to achieve a predetermined therapeutic goal.", 
    "89": "The average cost per 1% decrease in total cholesterol is 21.9% higher on 10 mg pravastatin daily than on 10 mg simvastatin daily. Similarly the average cost per 1% decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is 23.1% higher on 10 mg pravastatin than on 10 mg simvastatin daily. This difference is consistent throughout the dosage range. The use of incremental doses of simvastatin monotherapy in order to reach a predetermined therapeutic goal (LDL < or = 4.14 mmol/l) is more cost-effective than an equivalent pravastatin dosage regimen. Total treatment costs for simvastatin-treated patients are 3.5% less than for pravastatin-treated patients. More patients on simvastatin are successfully treated; the difference in overall treatment costs per successfully treated patient is 27.9% in favour of simvastatin. Sensitivity analysis shows these results to be stable under extreme scenarios.", 
    "90": "This analysis employed objective comparative efficacy data obtained from peer-reviewed sources to compare the economic and clinical outcomes of simvastatin and pravastatin in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. The acquisition cost of simvastatin is 10.3-22.8% higher than an equivalent milligram dose of pravastatin, depending on the dosage used. However, because of the greater milligram potency of simvastatin, it is a more cost-effective alternative. Simvastatin therefore provides better value for money than pravastatin in lowering lipid levels in clinical practice.", 
    "91": "The target organ for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to decrease cholesterol biosynthesis in hypercholesterolemic patients is the liver. Since bile acids undergo an enterohepatic circulation showing a strict organotropism for the liver and the small intestine, the structural elements of an inhibitor for HMG-CoA reductase were combined with those for specific molecular recognition of a bile acid molecule for selective uptake by hepatocytes. Either, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors HR 780 and mevinolin were covalently attached to 3 xi-(omega-aminoalkoxy)-7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acids to obtain bile acid prodrugs, or the side chain of bile acids at C-17 was replaced by 3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid--a structural element essential for inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase--to obtain hybrid bile acid: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The prodrugs could, as expected, not inhibit rat liver HMG-CoA reductase to a significant extent, whereas the hybrid inhibitors showed a stereospecific inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase from rat liver microsomes with an IC50-value of 0.7 microM for the most potent compound S 2467 and 6 microM for its diastereomere S 2468. Uptake measurements with isolated rat hepatocytes and ileal brush-border membrane vesicles from rabbit small intestine revealed a specific interaction of both classes of bile acid-derived HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with the hepatocyte and ileocyte bile acid uptake systems. Photoaffinity labeling studies using 3-azi- or 7-azi-derivatives of taurocholate with freshly isolated rat hepatocytes or rabbit ileal brush-border membrane vesicles revealed a specific interaction of bile acid derived HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with the respective putative bile acid transporters in the liver and the ileum demonstrating the bile acid character of these derivatives, both for the prodrugs and the hybrids. Cholesterol biosynthesis in Hep G2 cells was inhibited by the bile acid prodrugs with IC50-values in the range of 68 nM to 600 nM compared to 13 nM for HR 780 and 130 nM for mevinolin. Among the hybrid inhibitors, S 2467 was the most active compound with an IC50-value of 16 microM compared to 55 microM for its diastereomere S 2468. Preliminary in vivo experiments showed an inhibition of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis after oral dosage only with prodrugs such as S 3554, whereas the hybrid molecules were inactive after oral application.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "92": "Drug therapy for hypercholesterolaemia has remained controversial mainly because of insufficient clinical trial evidence for improved survival. The present trial was designed to evaluate the effect of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on mortality and morbidity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). 4444 patients with angina pectoris or previous myocardial infarction and serum cholesterol 5.5-8.0 mmol/L on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to double-blind treatment with simvastatin or placebo. Over the 5.4 years median follow-up period, simvastatin produced mean changes in total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol of -25%, -35%, and +8%, respectively, with few adverse effects. 256 patients (12%) in the placebo group died, compared with 182 (8%) in the simvastatin group. The relative risk of death in the simvastatin group was 0.70 (95% CI 0.58-0.85, p = 0.0003). The 6-year probabilities of survival in the placebo and simvastatin groups were 87.6% and 91.3%, respectively. There were 189 coronary deaths in the placebo group and 111 in the simvastatin group (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73), while noncardiovascular causes accounted for 49 and 46 deaths, respectively. 622 patients (28%) in the placebo group and 431 (19%) in the simvastatin group had one or more major coronary events. The relative risk was 0.66 (95% CI 0.59-0.75, p < 0.00001), and the respective probabilities of escaping such events were 70.5% and 79.6%. This risk was also significantly reduced in subgroups consisting of women and patients of both sexes aged 60 or more. Other benefits of treatment included a 37% reduction (p < 0.00001) in the risk of undergoing myocardial revascularisation procedures. This study shows that long-term treatment with simvastatin is safe and improves survival in CHD patients.", 
    "93": "Experimental and clinical observations suggest that lowering serum lipid levels may reduce the risk of restenosis after coronary angioplasty. We report the results of a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial evaluating whether lowering lipid levels with lovastatin can prevent or delay restenosis after angioplasty.", 
    "94": "Seven to 10 days before angioplasty, we randomly assigned eligible patients to receive lovastatin (40 mg orally twice daily) or placebo. Patients who underwent successful, complication-free, first-time angioplasty of a native vessel (the index lesion) continued to receive therapy for six months, when a second coronary angiogram was obtained. The primary end point was the extent of restenosis of the index lesion, as assessed by quantitative coronary arteriography. Of 404 patients randomly assigned to study groups, 384 underwent angioplasty; 354 of the procedures were successful, and 321 patients underwent angiographic restudy at six months.", 
    "95": "At base line, the patients in the lovastatin group (n = 203) and the placebo group (n = 201) were similar with respect to demographic clinical, angiographic, and laboratory characteristics. At base line the mean (+/- SD) degree of stenosis, expressed as a percentage of the diameter of the vessel, was 64 +/- 11 percent in the lovastatin group, as compared with 63 +/- 11 percent in the placebo group (P = 0.22). Despite a 42 percent reduction in the serum level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the lovastatin group, after six months of treatment the amount of stenosis seen in the second angiogram was 46 +/- 20 percent in the placebo group, as compared with 44 +/- 21 percent in the lovastatin group (P = 0.50). Similarly, there were no significant differences in minimal luminal diameter or other measures of restenosis. A trend was noted toward more myocardial infarctions in the lovastatin group, as a result of acute vessel closure or restenosis at the site of angioplasty, but there were no other important differences between the two groups in the frequency of fatal or nonfatal events at six months.", 
    "96": "Treatment with high-dose lovastatin initiated before coronary angioplasty does not prevent or delay the process of restenosis in the first six months after the procedure.", 
    "97": "Fluvastatin sodium is a new, entirely synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor that may be an effective lipid-lowering agent in patients whose hyperlipidemia does not respond to dietary therapy. We conducted a study to evaluate the effects of fluvastatin on lipoprotein levels in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia and to compare the efficacy and safety of two fluvastatin sodium dosing regimens: 20 mg once daily vs 10 mg twice daily.", 
    "98": "We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial involving 207 patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 4.15 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) or higher despite dietary intervention and with triglyceride levels of 3.38 mmol/L or lower. Three parallel treatment groups received 6 weeks of treatment with 20 mg of fluvastatin sodium once daily, 10 mg of fluvastatin sodium twice daily, or a placebo.", 
    "99": "Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were reduced from baseline by 16% and 22%, respectively, with 20 mg of fluvastatin sodium once daily (P < .001) and by 17% and 23%, respectively, with 10 mg of fluvastatin sodium twice daily (P < .001). Fluvastatin was well tolerated, and there were no serious clinical or biochemical adverse events ascribable to the drug.", 
    "100": "Fluvastatin therapy demonstrated excellent short-term safety and efficacy in reducing total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Fluvastatin sodium, the first totally synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor to be used in clinical trials, appears to be both effective and well tolerated at 20 mg/d, given in either a single or divided dose.", 
    "101": "Integrin-mediated adhesion is known to stimulate production of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (4,5-PIP2) and increase 4,5-PIP2 hydrolysis in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). We now show that treatment of cells with lovastatin, which inhibits modification of small GTP-binding proteins, reduced PIP2 levels and decreased calcium mobilization in response to PDGF and thrombin. In cell lysates, GTP gamma S stimulated PIP 5-kinase activity, and this effect was blocked by botulinum C3 exoenzyme, suggesting that Rho was responsible. GTP-bound recombinant Rho stimulated PIP 5-kinase activity, whereas GDP-Rho was much less potent and GTP-bound Rac was ineffective. Microinjected botulinum C3 exoenzyme caused diminished calcium mobilization in response to PDGF or thrombin. Conversely, microinjection of activated Rho reversed the decrease in calcium mobilization normally seen in nonadherent cells. These data demonstrate that Rho regulates 4,5-PIP2 synthesis and, indirectly, 4,5-PIP2 hydrolysis. They also raise the possibility that PIP2 synthesis could mediate the effects of Rho on the actin cytoskeleton.", 
    "102": "At a time of increasing use of simvastatin and other \"statin\" drugs for cholesterol lowering, we report a case of simvastatin-induced acute massive rhabdomyolysis with renal failure in a woman with primary biliary cirrhosis, occurring 2 years after starting the drug. The differential diagnosis is highlighted and the literature reviewed."
