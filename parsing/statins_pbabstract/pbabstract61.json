In female AFD patients, we identified a nine-marker panel of proteins with only three proteins, apolipoprotein E, haemoglobin \u03b1-2, and peroxiredoxin 2, common to both genders, suggesting a gender-specific alteration in plasma biomarkers in patients with AFD. The biomarkers were validated in plasma samples from 48 subjects using MRM, and they performed inferiorly in patients with heart failure.",

National Institutes of Health has sponsored a multicenter study in the USA for the last 10\u00a0years, which has collected valuable information in this context. Idiosyncratic DILI is like other adverse effects of drugs underestimated and underreported in most epidemiological studies. A recent prospective population-based study from Iceland found a crude incidence of approximately 19 cases per 100,000 and year. Antibiotic is the class of drugs most commonly implicated in patients with DILI. Amoxicillin-clavulanate continues to be the most commonly implicated agent occurring in approximately 1 out of 2,300 users. Drugs with the highest risk of DILI in the Icelandic study were azathioprine and infliximab. Although rare, statin-induced hepatotoxicity has been well documented. Liver injury associated with the use of herbal medicines and dietary supplements seems to be increasing. Information on the documented hepatotoxicity of drugs has recently been made easier by a website available in the public domain: LiverTox ( http://livertox.nlm.nih.gov ). Unfortunately, at the current time, pre-therapy risk assessment for DILI in the individual patient is difficult but previous well-documented hepatotoxicity is usually a contraindication for a subsequent treatment with the same drug.",

Historically, statins are hypothesized to be neuroprotective and beneficial in dementia, but recent reports have suggested an association with transient cognitive decline. We have critically appraised the relationship between statins and cognitive function in this review. Most of the data are observational and reported a protective effect of statins on dementia and Alzheimer's disease in patients with normal cognition at baseline. Few studies, including two randomized control trials, were unable to find a statistically significant decrease in the risk or improvement in patients with established dementia or decline in cognitive function with statin use. As more randomized control trials are required to definitively settle this, cardiovascular benefits of statins must be weighed against the risks of cognitive decline on an individual basis.",

Therefore, novel cost-effective approaches to improve treatment adherence are warranted.", 
    "37": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) has a high mortality rate mainly due to lung hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Simvastatin has been shown to prevent the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in experimental models of PH. We, therefore, hypothesized that antenatal simvastatin would attenuate PPHN in nitrofen-induced CDH in rats. The efficacy of antenatal simvastatin was compared with antenatal sildenafil, which has already been shown to improve pathological features of PPHN in nitrofen-induced CDH. On embryonic day (E) 9.5, nitrofen or vehicle was administered to pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats. On E11, nitrofen-treated rats were randomly assigned to antenatal simvastatin (20 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) orally), antenatal sildenafil (100 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) orally), or placebo administration from E11 to E21. On E21, fetuses were delivered by cesarean section, killed, and checked for left-sided CDH. Lung tissue was then harvested for further pathobiological evaluation. In nitrofen-induced CDH, simvastatin failed to reduce the incidence of nitrofen-induced CDH in the offspring and to increase the body weight, but improved the lung-to-body weight ratio and lung parenchyma structure. Antenatal simvastatin restored the pulmonary vessel density and external diameter, and reduced the pulmonary arteriolar remodeling compared with nitrofen-induced CDH. This was associated with decreased lung expression of endothelin precursor, endothelin type A and B receptors, endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase, together with restored lung activation of apoptotic processes mainly in the epithelium. Antenatal simvastatin presented similar effects as antenatal therapy with sildenafil on nitrofen-induced CDH. Antenatal simvastatin improves pathological features of lung hypoplasia and PPHN in experimental nitrofen-induced CDH.",

A single couple can produce hundreds or thousands of embryos and hence can be used as a simple high-throughput approach in toxicity studies. In the present study, zebrafish and sea urchin embryo bioassays were used to test the toxicity of four pharmaceuticals belonging to different therapeutic classes: diclofenac, propranolol, simvastatin and sertraline. Simvastatin was the most toxic tested compound for zebrafish embryo, followed by diclofenac. Sertraline was the most toxic drug to sea urchin embryos, inducing development abnormalities at the ng/L range. Overall, our results highlight the potential of sea urchin embryo bioassay as a promising and sensitive approach for the high-throughput methods to test the toxicity of new chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, and identify several drugs that should go through more detailed toxicity assays.",

The nature of polymorphism in simvastatin is ambiguous, as the crystal structures of the polymorphs do not show any significant change in crystal packing or molecular conformation. We utilize terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to characterize each of the polymorphs and probe the phase transitions in the range of 0.2-3.0 THz and for temperatures ranging from 90 to 390 K. In form III, vibrational modes are observed at 1.0, 1.25, and 1.7 THz. For form I, we find that the spectrum is dominated by a baseline corresponding to libration-vibration motions coupled to the dielectric relaxations, which is characteristic of a disordered hydrogen bonding material but with additional broad vibrational modes at 0.8 and 1.4 THz. In addition, the baseline shifts with temperature similar to that observed in disordered materials. This background absorption exhibits pronounced changes around the phase transition temperatures at 232 and 272 K. The results are in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that changes in the rotational freedom of the ester tail in the molecule govern the polymorphism in simvastatin.",

We attempted to investigate whether fluvastatin has any effect on VSMC proliferation and LTCC\u03b1 1C subunit (LTCC\u03b1 1C) expression as well as the potential mechanisms involved. The VSMCs proliferation was assayed by osteopontin immunofluorescent staining and [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation. The cell cycle was detected by flow cytometric analysis. The activity of RhoA was determined with pull-down assay. MAPK activity and LTCC\u03b1 1C expression were assessed by western blotting. We demonstrated fluvastatin prevented the VSMCs dedifferentiating into a proliferative phenotype and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase in response to PDGF-BB stimulation. Fluvastatin dose-dependently reversed the downregulation of LTCC\u03b1 1C expression induced by PDGF-BB. Inhibition of ROCK, ERK, or p38 MAPK activation largely enhanced the upregulation effect of fluvastatin (P < 0.01). However, blockade of JNK pathway had no effect on LTCC\u03b1 1C expression. We concluded LTCC\u03b1 1C was a VSMC contractile phenotype marker gene. Fluvastatin upregulated LTCC\u03b1 1C expression, at least in part, by inhibiting ROCK, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK activation. Fluvastatin may be a potential candidate for preventing or treating vascular diseases.",

    "63": "A total of 66 rats were used in this study to establish a model of MI. The 56 rats that survived the first 24h after surgery were randomly divided into four groups: the control group (C group), the rosuvastatin group (R group), the low-dose torasemide group (T1 group), and the high-dose torasemide group (T2 group). The four groups of rats received daily intragastric administration of normal saline, rosuvastatin, or torasemide (T1: 1mg/kg body weight; T2: 2mg/kg body weight) for a total of four weeks. The rats in the sham-operated group (n=14) also received daily intragastric administration of normal saline for four weeks. After four weeks of intervention, the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was measured in all groups of rats by haemodynamic methods. The rats were then sacrificed, and the left atrial tissues were collected. The collagen volume fractions (CVFs) in the left atrial tissues were determined using Masson's trichrome staining. The expression of phosphorylated p38 (P-p38) MAPK in the left atrial tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis.",

Rosuvastatin elevated the left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Both rosuvastatin and torasemide improved the haemodynamic parameters. No significant difference was detected in LVEDP between the R group and the T1 group (p=0.37). In contrast, LVEDP was significantly higher in the R group than in the T2 group (p <0.05). CVF (%) was markedly decreased in the R group compared to the C, T1, and T2 groups (decreased by 47.4%, 28%, and 20.1%, respectively). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the indices of P-p38 MAPK positive cells were significantly decreased in the R group in comparison with the C, T1, and T2 groups (decreased by 44.6%, 36.6%, and 21.4%, respectively). Western blot analysis demonstrated that P-p38 MAPK expression was markedly reduced in the R group compared with the C and T1 groups (reduced by 67% and 40.5%, respectively). The level of P-p38 MAPK in the R group was slightly higher than in the T2 group. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05).",

Mutations in four genes have been noted in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH): LDL receptor (most common), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), proprotein convertase subtilin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), and low-density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein (LDLRAP). In most cases, inheritance is autosomal co-dominant with homozygotes having double the LDL cholesterol levels of heterozygotes. Autosomal recessive inheritance is rare. The prevalence of the heterozygous state has been estimated at 1 in 200 to 1 in 500 and of the homozygous state from 1 in 160,000 to 1 in 1,000, 000.

Revascularization, which can be accomplished by an endovascular or surgical approach, is performed to improve quality of life or, in severe cases, for limb salvage. Over the past decade, percutaneous catheter-based techniques have improved such that acute procedural success is high even in complex anatomy. Patency rates have also increased with the use of atherectomy devices and drug-eluting stents. Often, patients with PAD have comorbidities that increase the risk of cardiovascular complications with surgical procedures. These factors have led to the adoption of an endovascular first strategy with surgical management reserved for selected patients. This review focuses on the most current clinical trials of endovascular therapy for PAD. In addition, older but relevant studies comparing endovascular and surgical approaches and contemporary surgical trials are presented for reference.",

The European Society of Cardiology/European Arthrosclerosis Society Guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias and the Chinese Guidelines on Prevention and Treatment of Dyslipidemia in Adults were used to compare the control rates of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG). Among the 8965 participants, 33.3% had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. According to the ESC Guidelines, the percentage of patients with not at goal LDL cholesterol did not differ significantly between patients with diabetes and those without diabetes (71.9% vs. 72.7%, P=0.46). The percentages of patients with not-at-goal levels of HDL and TG were 42.9% vs. 34.4% (P<0.001) and 39.1% vs. 34.3% (P<0.001) among patients with diabetes and those without, respectively. Only approximately 10% of patients in both groups had optimal LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG levels. Compared with patients without diabetes, patients with diabetes were more likely to have mixed dyslipidemia. Atorvastatin (47.0%) and simvastatin (34.4%) were the two most frequently used statins, and the average statin dosage was 29.09mg/day (simvastatin equivalent).

A single assay capable of simultaneously quantifying commonly used statins and their major metabolites has not been previously reported. Herein we describe the development and validation of a novel and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for simultaneously quantifying simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, and their metabolites, simvastatin acid, lovastatin acid, para-hydroxy atorvastatin, and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin in human plasma. Plasma samples were processed with a simple protein precipitation technique using acetonitrile, followed by chromatographic separation using an Agilent Zorbax Extend C18 column. A 12.0min linear gradient elution was used at a flow rate of 400\u03bcL/min with a mobile phase of water and methanol, both modified with 2mM ammonium formate and 0.2% formic acid. The analytes and internal standard, hesperetin, were detected using the selected reaction monitoring mode on a TSQ Quantum Discovery mass spectrometer with positive electrospray ionization. The assay exhibited a linear range of 1-1000nM for simvastatin acid and lovastatin acid, and a linear range of 0.1-100nM for the other analytes in human plasma. The accuracy and the within- and between-day precisions of the assay were within acceptable ranges, and the method was successfully utilized to quantify the statins and their metabolites in human plasma samples collected from an ongoing pharmacokinetic study.", 
    "72": "Less than 8.5% of ischemic stroke patients receive clot-busting drugs within the narrow time needed to reduce injury. Thus, there is need for an easily-accessible delayed post-stroke drug treatment to improve functional recovery. Various combinations of fluoxetine, simvastatin, and ascorbic acid were given to healthy rats to assess impact on neurogenesis versus controls. Fluoxetine combined with simvastatin and ascorbic acid produced a 19-fold increase in neurogenesis versus controls in healthy rats; fluoxetine alone produced 10-fold increase. We next tried a couple of drug combinations versus control in endothelin-induced stroked rats. Combined fluoxetine/ simvastatin/ascorbic acid treatment, given to stroked rats 20-26 hours after stroke induction and continued for 31 days, produced strong recovery as measured by Montoya staircase test (mean recovery to 85% of pre-stroke function) and Forelimb Asymmetry test (mean recovery to 90% of pre-stroke function). Fluoxetine and ascorbic acid without simvastatin only produced ~50% of recovery produced by the 3-drug combination. Our results indicate that combined treatment of Fluoxetine, simvastatin and ascorbic acid represents a promising delayed stroke treatment that greatly improves functional recovery in rats and warrants further study in human patient populations.

    "73": "A rapid increase in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression by stimulated leukocytes is common in many diseases. Recent evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of statins are mediated in part by the suppression of MMP-9 release. In this study, we investigated the effect of statin on MMP-9 expression and its antagonist, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in LPS-stimulated leukocytes. Rat neutrophils and monocytes were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of simvastatin. MMP-9 secretion and mRNA expression were analyzed using ELISA and RT-PCR, respectively. Total MMP-9 protein production was measured by Western blot analysis. Potential signal transduction pathways responsible for MMP-9 production were investigated using luciferase reporter assays (NF-\u03baB), pull-down assays (RhoA), and pharmacological inhibition. Our data show that MMP-9 and TIMP-1 expression are differentially induced by LPS in neutrophils and monocytes. We showed that rapid MMP-9 release occurred mainly via secretion from intracellular stores. Moreover, we showed that statin significantly suppressed LPS-induced MMP-9 release and mRNA expression in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. We also evaluated that simvastain postponed the rapid LPS-induced MMP-9 release for about 20\u2009min. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the suppressive effect of simvastatin on LPS-stimulated MMP-9 release does not occur via the NF-\u03baB pathway and the MAPKs pathway, but via the RhoA/ROCK pathway.",

The influence of cationic charge densities of chitosan (low CS(L), medium CS(M), high CS(H) molecular weights) and Labrasol(\u00ae) in solubility enhancement and modifying the release was investigated, using atorvastatin (ATR) as poorly soluble model drug. Compared to CS(M) and CS(H); low cationic charge of CS(L) acted as both electrostatic and steric stabilizer by significant size reduction to 394 nm with charge of 21.5 meV. Solubility of ATR-CS(L) increased to 60-fold relative to pure ATR and ATR-L. Nanocrystals were characterized for physiochemical properties. Scanning electron microscopy revealed scaffold-like structures with high surface area. X-ray powder diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry revealed crystalline to slight amorphous state changes after cationic charge size reduction. Fourier transform-infrared spectra indicated no potent drug-excipient interactions. The enhanced dissolution profile of ATR-CS(L) indicates that sustained release was achieved compared with ATR-L and Lipitor(\u00ae). Anti-hyperlipidemic performance was pH dependent where ATR-CS(L) exhibited 2.5-fold higher efficacy at pH 5 compared to pH 6 and Lipitor(\u00ae). Stability studies indicated marked changes in size and charge for ATR-L compared to ATR-CS(L) exemplifying importance of the stabilizer. Therefore, nanocrystals developed with CS(L) as a stabilizer is a promising choice to enhance dissolution, stability, and in-vivo efficacy of major Biopharmaceutical Classification System II/IV drugs.",

Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase reduces cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver. Synthetic drugs, statins, are commonly used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Due to the side effects of statins, natural HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors of plant origin are needed. In this study, 25 medicinal plant methanol extracts were screened for anti-HMG-CoA reductase activity. Basella alba leaf extract showed the highest inhibitory effect at about 74%. Thus, B. alba was examined in order to investigate its phytochemical components.

The correlation between smoking status and either MDA-LDL or LDL-C level was investigated in two groups: namely, patients with and patients without statin treatment. In the non-statin group, MDA-LDL level and MDA-LDL/LDL-C ratio were significantly higher in ex-smokers/current smokers compared with non-smokers, while no significant correlation was observed between smoking status and LDL-C level.

    "84": "Instrumental variable (IV) methods are increasingly being used in comparative effectiveness research. Studies using these methods often compare 2 particular treatments, and the researchers perform their IV analyses conditional on patients' receiving this subset of treatments (while ignoring the third option of \"neither treatment\"). The ensuing selection bias that occurs due to this restriction has gone relatively unnoticed in interpretations and discussions of these studies' results. In this paper we describe the structure of this selection bias with examples drawn from commonly proposed instruments such as calendar time and preference, illustrate the bias with causal diagrams, and estimate the magnitude and direction of possible bias using simulations. A noncausal association between the proposed instrument and the outcome can occur in analyses restricted to patients receiving a subset of the possible treatments. This results in bias in the numerator for the standard IV estimator; the bias is amplified in the treatment effect estimate. The direction and magnitude of the bias in the treatment effect estimate are functions of the distribution of and relationships between the proposed instrument, treatment values, unmeasured confounders, and outcome. IV methods used to compare a subset of treatment options are prone to substantial biases, even when the proposed instrument appears relatively strong.", 
    "85": "Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), which is a rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. The pleiotropic effects of statins may be mediated by the inhibition of downstream products such as small GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Ras and Rac whose localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation. Preclinical studies of statins in different cancer cell lines and animal models showed antiproliferative, pro\u2011apoptotic and anti-invasive effects. Notably, statins showed targeted action in cancerous cell lines compared to normal cells. Previous studies have also shown the synergistic effects of statins with chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy. This effect of statins was also observed in chemotherapeutic-resistant tumors. Statins were reported to sensitize the cells to radiation by arresting them in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle. Similarly, population-based studies also demonstrated a chemopreventive and survival benefit of statins in various types of cancers. However, this benefit has yet to be proven in clinical trials. The inter-individual variation in response to statins may be contributed to many genetic and non-genetic factors, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms in HMGCR gene and the overexpression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, which was reported to reduce HMGCR enzyme activity. However, more studies with large phase III randomized controlled trials in cancer patients should be conducted to establish the effect of stains in cancer prevention and treatment.", 
    "86": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive, multifocal disease of the arterial wall, which is mainly fuelled by local and systemic inflammation, often resulting in acute ischemic events following plaque rupture and vessel occlusion. When assessing the cardiovascular risk of an individual patient, we must consider both global measures of disease activity and local features of plaque vulnerability, in addition to anatomical distribution and degree of established atherosclerosis. These parameters cannot be measured with conventional anatomical imaging techniques alone, which are designed primarily to identify the presence of organic intraluminal obstruction in symptomatic patients. However, molecular imaging with PET, using specifically targeted radiolabeled probes to track active in vivo atherosclerotic mechanisms noninvasively, may potentially provide a method that is better suited for this purpose. Vascular PET imaging can help us to further understand aspects of plaque biology, and current evidence supports a future role as an emerging clinical tool for the quantification of cardiovascular risk in order to guide and monitor responses to antiatherosclerosis treatments and to distinguish high-risk plaques.", 
    "87": "Whether due to atherosclerotic disease or mechanical intervention, vascular injury is a frequently encountered pathology in cardiovascular medicine. The past decade has seen growing interest in the role of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in vessel recovery postinjury. Despite this, the definition, origin and potential role of endothelial progenitor cells in vascular regeneration remains highly controversial. While animal work has shown early promise, evidence of a therapeutic role for endothelial progenitor cells in humans remains elusive. To date, clinical trials involving direct cell administration, growth factor therapy and endothelial cell capture stents have largely been disappointing, although this may in part reflect limitations in study design. This article will outline the pathophysiological mechanisms of vascular injury with an emphasis on endothelial progenitor cell biology and the potential therapeutic role of this exciting new field.", 
    "88": "Statins, such as lovastatin, can induce a cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. This robust antiproliferative activity remains intact in many cancer cells that are deficient in cell cycle checkpoints and leads to an increased expression of CDK inhibitor proteins p27Kip1 and p21Cip1. The molecular details of this statin-induced growth arrest remains unclear. Here we present evidence that lovastatin can induce the degradation of Skp2, a subunit of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase that targets p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 for proteasomal destruction. The statin-induced degradation of Skp2 is cell cycle phase independent and does not require its well characterised degradation pathway mediated by APC/CCdh1- or Skp2 autoubiquitination. An N-terminal domain preceding the F-box of Skp2 is both necessary and sufficient for its statin mediated degradation. The degradation of Skp2 results from statin induced depletion of geranylgeranyl isoprenoid intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of geranylgeranyl-transferase-I also promotes APC/CCdh1- independent degradation of Skp2, indicating that de-modification of a geranylgeranylated protein triggers this novel pathway of Skp2 degradation.", 
    "89": "Oncolytic adenovirus and apoptosis inducer TRAIL are promising cancer therapies. Their antitumor efficacy, when used as single agents, is limited. Oncolytic adenoviruses have low infection activity, and cancer cells develop resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here, we explored combining prostate-restricted replication competent adenovirus-mediated TRAIL (PRRA-TRAIL) with lovastatin, a commonly used cholesterol-lowering drug, as a potential therapy for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Lovastatin significantly enhanced the efficacy of PRRA-TRAIL by promoting the in vivo tumor suppression, and the in vitro cell killing and apoptosis induction, via integration of multiple molecular mechanisms. Lovastatin enhanced PRRA replication and virus-delivered transgene expression by increasing the expression levels of CAR and integrins, which are critical for adenovirus 5 binding and internalization. Lovastatin enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis by increasing death receptor DR4 expression. These multiple effects of lovastatin on CAR, integrins and DR4 expression were closely associated with cholesterol-depletion in lipid rafts. These studies, for the first time, show correlations between cholesterol/lipid rafts, oncolytic adenovirus infection efficiency and the antitumor efficacy of TRAIL at the cellular level. This work enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that support use of lovastatin, in combination with PRRA-TRAIL, as a candidate strategy to treat human refractory prostate cancer in the future.", 
    "90": "Periprocedural myocardial injury is a prognostically important complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, it still remains unclear whether and how intensive atorvastatin therapy attenuates the unfavorable inflammatory responses of monocytes associated with PCI. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of intensive atorvastatin therapy on inflammatory responses of monocytes in Chinese patients with unstable angina who received PCI in order to explore the potential anti-inflammatory mechanism. Ninety-six patients with unstable angina were randomly assigned to atorvastatin 80\u00a0mg (intensive) or atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg (conventional) treatment at a 1:1 ratio. Creatine kinase MB (CK-MB), cTnI, hs-CRP, and IL-6 were assessed, and circulating CD14(+) monocytes were simultaneously obtained using CD14 MicroBeads 2\u00a0h before and 24\u00a0h after PCI. Plasma levels of CK-MB, cTnI, hs-CRP, and IL-6 were higher in the conventional dose group versus those in the intensive dose group following PCI. Furthermore, intensive atorvastatin treatment markedly reduced the expressions and responses of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, and CCR2 of CD14(+) monocytes versus the conventional dose group and significantly increased the activated peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3 in the CD14(+) monocytes post-PCI. Notably, the changes in responses of TLR2, TLR4, and CCR2 of CD14(+) monocytes between the two groups were all reversed by PPAR\u03b3 antagonist and augmented by PPAR\u03b3 agonist. In conclusion, a single high (80\u00a0mg) loading dose of atorvastatin reduced the inflammatory response in Chinese patients with unstable angina following PCI. The anti-inflammatory role of intensive atorvastatin was possibly due to attenuation of inflammatory response in monocytes via PPAR\u03b3 activation.",

Surprisingly, a combination of Rosu (10 nM)+Bex (0.3 \u03bcM), which did not influence Ang-II-induced MC recruitment when either stimulus was studied alone, significantly reduced this response. This effect was accompanied by diminished Ang-II-induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CX3CL1 endothelial expression and CXCL1, CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL5 production.

The failure of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists falls on the heels of the failure of Arbaclofen's efficacy in children and adults with autism or FXS. In contrast, efficacy has been demonstrated in a controlled trial of minocycline in children with FXS. Minocycline lowers the abnormally elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9 in FXS. Acamprosate and lovastatin have been beneficial in open-label trials in FXS. The first 5 years of life may be the most efficacious time for intervention when combined with behavioral and/or educational interventions.",

Longer center participation in VQI was associated with improved perioperative MM overall. This was also noted across all procedure types, with MM increasing from 47% to 82% for aneurysm repairs and 69% to 83% for carotid procedures from 1 to 12 years of participation in VQI. After multivariable adjustment, centers in VQI \u22653 years were 30% more likely to have patients on MM (odds ratio, 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.4). Importantly, discharge on AP and statin therapy was associated with improved 5-year survival, compared with discharge on neither medication (82% [95% CI, 81%-83%] vs 67% [95% CI, 62%-72%]), and an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5-0.7; P < .001).

In the present study, the possibility of retention modeling for method development purposes in SFC was investigated, considering several non-linear isocratic relationships. Therefore, both isocratic and gradient runs were performed, involving different column chemistries and analytes possessing diverse physico-chemical properties. The isocratic retention data of these compounds could be described accurately using the non-linear retention models typically used in HILIC and reversed-phase LC. The interconversion between isocratic and gradient retention data was found to be less straightforward than in RPLC and HILIC because of pressure effects. The possibility of gradient predictions using gradient scouting runs to estimate the retention parameters was investigated as well, showing that predictions for other gradients with the same starting conditions were acceptable (always below 5%), whereas prediction errors for gradients with a different starting condition were found to be highly dependent on the compound. The second part of the study consisted of the gradient optimization of two pharmaceutical mixtures (one involving atorvastatin and four related impurities, and one involving a 16 components mixture including eight drugs and their main phase I metabolites). This could be done via individual retention modeling based on gradient scouting runs. The best linear gradient was found via a grid search and the best multi-segment gradient via the previously published one-segment-per-component search. The latter improved the resolution between the critical pairs for both mixtures, while still giving accurate prediction errors (using the same starting concentrations as the gradient scouting runs used to build the model). The optimized separations were found in less than 3 h and 8 h of analysis time (including equilibration times), respectively.",

In this study, we have investigated possible effects of rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, thought to have an antioxidant effect, on noise-induced oxidative stress in the serum of rat models. Thirty-two male Wistar albino rats were used. In order to ease their adaptation, 2 weeks before the experiment, the rats were divided into four groups (with eight rats per each group): Noise exposure plus rosuvastatin usage, only noise exposure, only rosuvastatin usage and control. After the data had been collected, oxidant (Malondialdehyde, nitric oxide [NO], protein carbonyl [PC]) and antioxidant (superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione peroxidase [GSH-PX], catalase [CAT]) parameters were analyzed in the serum. Results indicated that SOD values were found to be significantly lower, while PC values in serum were remarkably higher in the group that was exposed to only noise. GSH-Px values in serum dramatically increased in the group on which only rosuvastatin was used. During noise exposure, the use of rosuvastatin caused significantly increased CAT values, whereas it resulted in reduced PC and NO values in serum. In conclusion, our data show that noise exposure leads to oxidative stress in rat serum; however, rosuvastatin therapy decreases the oxidative stress caused by noise exposure.",

The increase in HDLC level was found in both groups, but significant only with statin-NER combination therapy (P < .001). Atorvastatin combined with NER reduced TC/HDLC ratio almost double as compared with that of atorvastatin alone (102% and 36.6% reduction, respectively).

Although recipient statin use was associated with the increased incidence of Gram-negative bacteremia (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.22, (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.2), P=0.01) without affecting mortality, donor statin use was associated with an increased incidence of respiratory viral infections in recipients (aHR 2.84 (95% CI 1.3-6.0), P=0.007). The overall incidence of invasive fungal infections and CMV reactivation and CMV disease were not impacted by recipient or donor statin use.

The AHA/ACC document has developed a new model for estimating cardiovascular risk for primary prevention which is not comparable with the SCORE recommended in the European guidelines. This guideline does not establish a fixed target for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc). Instead, it identifies 4 major statin benefit groups at risk for the development ASCVD, who should receive low-, moderate-, and high-intensity statin therapy to reduce LCLc. In contrast, the European guidelines maintain LDLc as the main treatment target and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a secondary treatment target. The document recommends calculating cardiovascular risk for the overall treatment of patients with dyslipidemia according to 4 risk levels (low, moderate, high, and very high), establishes LDLc treatment targets, and recommends a statin-based therapeutic strategy and other, lipid-lowering strategies, aimed at achieving these targets. The American guidelines cannot be extrapolated to the European population. Target-based treatment, as recommended in the EAS/ESC guidelines, is the best strategy for Europe.

Recently, it has been shown that statins exert additional 'pleiotropic' effects by increasing expression levels of the membrane water channels aquaporin 2 (AQP2). AQP2 is localized mainly in the kidney and plays a critical role in determining cellular water content. This additional effect is independent of cholesterol homoeostasis, and depends on depletion of mevalonate-derived intermediates of sterol synthetic pathways, i.e. farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. By up-regulating the expression levels of AQP2, statins increase water reabsorption by the kidney, thus opening up a new avenue in treating patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a hereditary disease that yet lacks high-powered and limited side effects therapy. Aspects related to water balance determined by AQP2 in the kidney, as well as standard and novel therapeutic strategies of NDI are discussed.",

However, Bax mRNA in simvastatin group were lower than those in model group, with the information of (0.658 \u00b1 0.197), (1.746 \u00b1 0.315), (0.670 \u00b1 0.221), (0.952 \u00b1 0.164) and (0.575 \u00b1 0.174). The differences had statistical significance at corresponding time point in each group (F(4, 8, 16, 24, 48) = 74.115, 54.504, 81.271, 243.743, 97.163, P < 0.05).", 
    "198": "Simvastatin has protective effects on retinal ischemia reperfusion injury, and the mechanism is closely related to inhibiting retinal cell apoptosis by adjusting the express of Bcl-2 and Bax.", 
    "199": "The prescription of recommended medical therapies is a key factor to improve prognosis after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). However, reasons for cardiovascular therapies discontinuation after hospital discharge are poorly reported in previous studies.", 
    "200": "We enrolled 3055 consecutive patients hospitalized with a main diagnosis of ACS in four Swiss university hospitals with a prospective one-year follow-up. We assessed the self-reported use of recommended therapies and the reasons for medication discontinuation according to the patient interview performed at one-year follow-up.", 
    "201": "3014 (99.3%) patients were discharged with aspirin, 2983 (98.4%) with statin, 2464 (81.2%) with beta-blocker, 2738 (90.3%) with ACE inhibitors/ARB and 2597 (100%) with P2Y12 inhibitors if treated with coronary stent. At the one-year follow-up, the discontinuation percentages were 2.9% for aspirin, 6.6% for statin, 11.6% for beta-blocker, 15.1% for ACE inhibitor/ARB and 17.8% for P2Y12 inhibitors. Most patients reported having discontinued their medication based on their physicians' decision: 64 (2.1%) for aspirin, 82 (2.7%) for statin, 212 (8.6%) for beta-blocker, 251 (9.1% for ACE inhibitor/ARB) and 293 (11.4%) for P2Y12 inhibitors, while side effect, perception that medication was unnecessary and medication costs were uncommon reported reasons (<2%) according to the patients.", 
    "202": "Discontinuation of recommended therapies after ACS differs according the class of medication with the lowest percentages for aspirin. According to patients, most stopped their cardiovascular medication based on their physician's decision, while spontaneous discontinuation was infrequent.", 
    "203": "A high-throughput, specific, and rapid liquid chromatography with\u00a0tandem mass spectrometry method was established and validated for the simultaneous determination of atorvastatin and its two major metabolites, ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin and para-hydroxyatorvastatin, in human plasma. A simple salting-out-assisted liquid-liquid extraction using acetonitrile and a mass-spectrometry-friendly salt, ammonium acetate, was employed to extract the analytes from human plasma. A recovery of more than 81% for all analytes was achieved in 1 min extraction time. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Kinetex XB C18 column utilizing a gradient elution starting with a 60% of water solution (1% formic acid), followed by increasing percentages of acetonitrile. Analytes were detected on a tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source that was operated in the positive mode, using the transitions of m/z 559.3 \u2192 m/z 440.2 for atorvastatin, and m/z 575.3 \u2192 m/z 440.2 for both ortho- and para-hydroxyatorvastatin. Deuterium-labeled compounds were used as the internal standards. The method was validated over the concentration ranges of 0.0200-15.0 ng/mL for atorvastatin and ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin, and 0.0100-2.00 ng/mL for para-hydroxyatorvastatin with acceptable accuracy and precision. It was then successfully applied in a bioequivalence study of atorvastatin.", 
    "204": "During the last 50 years, it has become evident that atherosclerosis originates in childhood. Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) events are rare in children, autopsy data and imaging studies have documented subclinical disease in association with measurable risk factors during childhood. When present at a young age, risk factors track into adulthood and have been associated with a moderate to high risk of future CVD. As such, the ability to identify this vulnerable population creates the opportunity to prevent the development of risk factors and future CVD events with effective management of genetic and acquired risk factors. In 2011, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Expert Panel published comprehensive guidelines summarizing the current evidence and providing developmentally appropriate recommendations for screening, treatment, and follow-up of children and adults younger than 21 years at risk for premature CVDs such as myocardial infarction and stroke. In addition to screening individuals with a family history of hypercholesterolemia and/or premature CVD, the Expert Panel recommended universal screening of all children between 9 and 11 years of age and then again between 17 and 21 years of age. Although the recommendation for universal screening, regardless of general health or the presence/absence of risk factors of CVD, is not without controversy, this review serves to create awareness among healthcare providers, elected officials, and the lay public about the burden of CVD, the opportunity for prevention, and the benefits of early and effective therapeutic intervention with lifestyle changes and lipid-lowering medications.", 
    "205": "Hypertriglyceridemia is a prevalent yet under-addressed condition, often seen in association with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, obesity, and physical inactivity. The control of triglyceride (TG) levels is essential to prevent the development of coronary artery disease and pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia. Omega-3-carboxylic acid (Epanova) is the third prescription omega-3 fatty acid product approved in the United States as an adjunct to diet for treating severe hypertriglyceridemia (\u2265 500 mg/dL). At the approved dosage, it reduced baseline serum TG levels by 25-30% in a placebo-controlled study. It reduced serum TG levels by an additional 8-15% in patients who were already taking statin therapy. It appeared to have a better bioavailability profile compared with an equivalent dose of omega-3-acid ethyl ester (Lovaza) in both low-fat and high-fat diets. However, evidence behind the effects of omega-3-carboxylic acid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and pancreatitis risk, is lacking. Overall, it is well tolerated, but may induce common gastrointestinal side effects, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. At this time, omega-3-carboxylic acid is an alternative adjunct therapy (in addition to diet) for hypertriglyceridemia. Its potential clinical benefits over other omega-3 formulations have yet to be evaluated.", 
    "206": "Whether statin therapy is as effective in women as in men is debated, especially for primary prevention. We undertook a meta-analysis of statin trials in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration database to compare the effects of statin therapy between women and men.", 
    "207": "We performed meta-analyses on data from 22 trials of statin therapy versus control (n=134,537) and five trials of more-intensive versus less-intensive statin therapy (n=39,612). Effects on major vascular events, major coronary events, stroke, coronary revascularisation and mortality were weighted per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol and effects in men and women compared with a Cox model that adjusted for non-sex differences. For subgroup analyses, we used 99% CIs to make allowance for the multiplicity of comparisons.", 
    "208": "46,675 (27%) of 174,149 randomly assigned participants were women. Allocation to a statin had similar absolute effects on 1 year lipid concentrations in both men and women (LDL cholesterol reduced by about 1.1 mmol/L in statin vs control trials and roughly 0.5 mmol/L for more-intensive vs less-intensive therapy). Women were generally at lower cardiovascular risk than were men in these trials. The proportional reductions per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol in major vascular events were similar overall for women (rate ratio [RR] 0.84, 99% CI 0.78-0.91) and men (RR 0.78, 99% CI 0.75-0.81, adjusted p value for heterogeneity by sex=0.33) and also for those women and men at less than 10% predicted 5 year absolute cardiovascular risk (adjusted heterogeneity p=0.11). Likewise, the proportional reductions in major coronary events, coronary revascularisation, and stroke did not differ significantly by sex. No adverse effect on rates of cancer incidence or non-cardiovascular mortality was noted for either sex. These net benefits translated into all-cause mortality reductions with statin therapy for both women (RR 0.91, 99% CI 0.84-0.99) and men (RR 0.90, 99% CI 0.86-0.95; adjusted heterogeneity p=0.43).", 
    "209": "In men and women at an equivalent risk of cardiovascular disease, statin therapy is of similar effectiveness for the prevention of major vascular events.",
