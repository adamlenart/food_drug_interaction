    "0": "Rhabdomyolysis has been the theme in medical literature for the last fifty years. In these last decades, with statins being used in primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention events, this theme returns and statins are now pointed as the trigger to this almost always fatal complication. Rhabdomyolysis due to statins administration occurs mainly in association with other drugs. Our case reports on a patient with fatal statin-induced rhabdomyolysis whose medical history included diffuse atherosclerotic disease.", 
    "1": "Atherosclerosis is associated with a number of functional abnormalities that affect endothelium-dependent vasomotor function, inflammation, and thrombosis. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have effects on many of these functions, likely explaining their benefit in reducing the incidence of clinical events in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Statins may improve this vascular biology by lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or potentially by a number of non-LDL-related mechanisms. Cell culture and some animal studies have demonstrated LDL-independent effects of statins. The non-LDL mechanisms include effects on isoprenoid production and function, interactions between caveolin and nitric oxide synthase, and direct immunomodulatory effects. Although these mechanisms are clearly demonstrated in the experimental setting, their relevance to the clinical use of statins is unknown. From a purely pragmatic viewpoint, the debate of lipid versus nonlipid effects of statins matters little to clinical practice. Their proven effect on vascular biology and risk reduction justifies their important therapeutic role.", 
    "2": "Endothelial dysfunction contributes to mechanisms of atherogenesis and its clinical manifestations, including coronary heart disease. Cardiovascular risk factors have been linked directly to a loss of endothelial function, such as endothelium-dependent nitric oxide (NO) release, resulting in abnormal vasodilation in response to various stimuli. There is evidence that multiple risk factors, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, lead to a synergistic effect on endothelial dysfunction, likely through oxidative stress mechanisms. Damage to the endothelium leads to reduced NO bioavailability and facilitates vessel wall permeability to low-density lipoprotein. Certain agents, including the antihypertensive drug amlodipine and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) atorvastatin, are known to influence endothelial function and NO bioavailability directly; these properties may contribute to clinical benefits. Recent experimental evidence at the cellular level indicates that these agents stimulate NO release from human endothelial cells in a highly synergistic fashion. The clinical implications of these observations are discussed in this article in the context of cardiovascular risk factor management strategies.", 
    "3": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that is manifested by cognitive decline, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and diffuse structural abnormalities in the brain. Its prevalence is predicted to rise 4-fold in the next 50 years. AD is characterized pathologically by deposition of extracellular beta-amyloid and accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles. Neuronal death and specific neurotransmitter deficits also are part of the pathologic picture. Strategies to delay symptom progression have focused on addressing the neurotransmitter deficits. Strategies to delay the onset or biologic progression of AD largely have targeted the plaques formed by the deposition of beta-amyloid. AD and cardiovascular disease share common risk factors, notably hypercholesterolemia, and occur together more often than expected by chance. Therapy with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) is the first-line treatment option for hypercholesterolemia, and observational studies have suggested that the risk of AD is reduced in patients who receive statin therapy in midlife. This reduction in risk of AD observed with statin therapy may be due to statins reducing beta-amyloid formation and deposition or to their known anti-inflammatory effects. Two randomized double-blind statin trials in patients with AD to assess the potential for statins to slow disease progression are currently under way. If successful, statin AD primary prevention trials may be developed.", 
    "4": "The aim of the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) trial was to determine whether intensive low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering to a level of approximately 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) with atorvastatin 80 mg/day was more efficacious than standard LDL cholesterol lowering to 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) with pravastatin 40 mg/day in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In total, 4,162 men and women aged >18 years, who had been hospitalized for an ACS within the preceding 10 days, were randomized to receive either pravastatin 40 mg/day or atorvastatin 80 mg/day. The median LDL cholesterol levels achieved during follow-up were 95 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) in the pravastatin group and 62 mg/dL (1.6 mmol/L) in the atorvastatin group (P <0.001). Standard treatment (statin) with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (pravastatin 40 mg/day) resulted in a 22% reduction in LDL cholesterol levels at 30 days compared with a 51% reduction with intensive therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg/day). At 2 years, a relative risk reduction of 16% (95% confidence interval, 5%-26%; P = 0.005) in the primary end point rate (death, myocardial infarction, documented unstable angina requiring hospitalization, coronary revascularization, or stroke) was seen in patients receiving intensive statin treatment compared with standard statin therapy. The benefit of intensive treatment was apparent as early as 30 days and was consistent over time. The PROVE IT-TIMI 22 data indicate that patients recently hospitalized for an ACS benefit from early and continued lowering of LDL cholesterol to levels substantially below current guideline recommendations.", 
    "5": "Clinical trials that incorporate elements of \"real-world\" experience are of great value to practicing physicians. Using a trial design adapted to approximate clinical settings, the Aggressive Lipid-Lowering Initiation Abates New Cardiac Events (ALLIANCE) trial compared a focused treatment strategy using atorvastatin with usual medical care. Patients eligible for study participation were predefined based on diagnosis codes for coronary heart disease from US managed care database records; 66% of these patients were taking lipid-lowering medications at study entry. In contrast to standard clinical trials, ALLIANCE maintained a real-world environment by limiting the interactions of investigators with patients after dose titration of aggressive treatment to a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal < 80 mg/dL (2.1 mmol/L) or maximum atorvastatin dose of 80 mg/day. After 51.5 months of follow-up, the study showed that aggressive treatment with atorvastatin was associated with significantly lower LDL cholesterol levels (147 mg/dL [3.8 mmol/L] to 95 mg/dL [2.5 mmol/L]) over usual care (146 mg/dL [3.8 mmol/L] to 111 mg/dL [2.9 mmol/L]). This greater reduction in LDL cholesterol was accompanied by improved outcomes in the composite primary end point of cardiovascular events (-17% with atorvastatin vs. usual care; P = 0.02) and particularly in the end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction (-47% with atorvastatin vs. usual care; P = 0.0002). No safety difference was noted between the 2 treatment groups. These results indicate that usual-care treatment was not equivalent to targeted statin therapy, even in a trial conducted to minimize potential bias owing to traditional patient selection and trial design methods.", 
    "6": "The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is expected to increase dramatically over the next decade. Patients with type 2 diabetes are at a much greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) than are nondiabetic individuals. Consequently, the treatment of CVD risk factors is a healthcare priority in this patient population. Dyslipidemia is a major cardiovascular (CV) risk factor in patients with type 2 diabetes, and it is characterized by elevated triglyceride levels, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and a preponderance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Subgroup analyses of clinical trial data suggest that treatment of the entire range of lipid abnormalities may reduce CV risk in this patient population. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the best therapy for LDL cholesterol reduction. A number of statin trials have shown significant CV risk reduction through LDL cholesterol lowering in subgroups of patients with diabetes. The recently published Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), a placebo-controlled trial conducted solely in patients with type 2 diabetes, terminated 2 years earlier than its anticipated length owing to the significant reduction in number of CV events observed in patients randomized to receive low-dose atorvastatin versus placebo. These results suggest that low-dose statin therapy with atorvastatin results in significant reduction of CV events in patients with type 2 diabetes without prior CVD or high LDL cholesterol levels. Based on this evidence, patients with type 2 diabetes may be candidates for statin therapy regardless of LDL cholesterol level and in the absence of a previous CV event.", 
    "7": "The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) was the first trial of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) to assess the benefits of lipid lowering in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with hypertension who were not deemed to have dyslipidemia by conventional measures. A total of 19,342 patients with hypertension and > or =3 cardiovascular risk factors, but without CHD, were enrolled in ASCOT. Of these, 10,305 patients with a serum cholesterol level of < or =250 mg/dL (< or =6.5 mmol/L) were randomized to either atorvastatin (10 mg/day) or placebo in the ASCOT lipid-lowering arm (ASCOT-LLA). Follow-up was planned for an average of 5 years. The ASCOT-LLA was stopped after 3.3 years owing to the superiority of atorvastatin 10 mg over placebo in reducing the primary end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and fatal CHD. Patients receiving atorvastatin experienced a significant reduction in total cholesterol (50 mg/dL [1.3 mmol/L]) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (46 mg/dL [1.2 mmol/L]) levels after 1 year compared with those who received placebo. Cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin was associated with a highly significant reduction in the primary end point of nonfatal MI and fatal CHD (36%, P = 0.0005). The observed benefit was consistent across the secondary end points and the 18 prespecified subgroups. The ASCOT-LLA findings have influenced lipid-lowering guidelines and support the concept that treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease should be based on the assessment of all cardiovascular risk factors, rather than on numerical thresholds of individual risk factors, to determine treatment strategies.", 
    "8": "The short-term and small-dose pleiotropic effects of atorvastatin and influence on sex steroid production were investigated in 35 premenopausal and 71 postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic, hypertriglyceridemic women, as well as the temporal differences in these pleiotropic effects. Atorvastatin (10 mg daily) was given for 6 months and fasting lipid concentrations, high sensitive CRP, and coagulo-fibrinolytic parameters were measured at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. Atorvastatin reduced the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, remnant-like particle lipoprotein cholesterol, and malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after 3 and 6 months in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Atorvastatin decreased significantly high-sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration (-47.6% and -58.0%, P<0.01) and tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ratio (-31.8% and -40.0%, P<0.001) after 6 months in pre- and postmenopausal women. There was no correlation between the pleiotropic effects and the improvement in the lipid profile. Furthermore, atorvastatin has no influence on sex steroid production in both pre- and postmenopausal period. The results indicate some short-term pleiotropic effects of small-dose atorvastatin therapy without influence of endocrinological status, which may be important with respect to the early benefits of statin therapy in the perimenopausal hyperlipidemic women.", 
    "9": "Lipoprotein abnormalities are fairly common after pediatric heart transplantation. Graft coronary artery disease (GCAD) limits long-term survival and has been linked to elevated serum triglyceride levels and decreased high-density lipoprotein levels. Histologically, GCAD represents intimal hyperplasia of the coronary vessel and is best imaged by intravascular ultrasound.A number of pharmacologic agents are available for the management of lipid disorders but experience with these drugs has mainly been in adults. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are currently used by many adult transplantation centers to alter lipid profiles in the hope of reducing GCAD. The use of statins among pediatric heart transplant centers is more limited. Although rhabdomyolysis is a concern with these agents, the incidence among individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy is low. Aside from their lipid-lowering properties, statins may also protect against graft failure and rejection.", 
    "10": "There is great interest in deciphering mechanisms of maladaptive remodeling in cardiac hypertrophy in the hope of affording clinical benefit. Potential targets of therapeutic intervention include the cytoplasmic phosphatase calcineurin and small guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins, such as Rac1 and RhoA, all of which have been implicated in maladaptive hypertrophy. However, little is known about the interaction-if any-between these important signaling molecules in hypertrophic heart disease. In this study, we examined the molecular interplay among these molecules, finding that Rho family guanosine triphosphatase signaling occurs either downstream of calcineurin or as a required, parallel pathway. It has been shown that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibition blocks hypertrophy, and we report here that \"statin\" therapy effectively suppresses small G protein activation and blunts hypertrophic growth in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, despite significant suppression of hypertrophy, clinical and hemodynamic markers remained compensated, suggesting that the hypertrophic growth induced by this pathway is not required to maintain circulatory performance.", 
    "11": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of model-based, quantitative decision making during the development of gemcabene, a novel lipid-altering agent. The decisions were driven by a model of the likely clinical profile of gemcabene in comparison with its competitors, such as 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, and their combination. Dose-response models were developed for the lipid effects (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol); adverse effects, such as persistent alanine aminotransferase elevation and myalgia; tolerability issues, such as headache; and risk reduction for coronary artery disease-related events for 5 statins, ezetimibe, gemcabene, and their combinations. The integrated model was based on the joint analysis of publicly available summary-level data and proprietary patient-level data and included information from almost 10,000 patients. The model was made available and accessible to the development team by using the Pharsight Drug Model Explorer model visualization technology. The modeling greatly enhanced the understanding of the clinical profile of gemcabene when given alone or in combination with a statin. The interaction between statins and gemcabene for the LDL-C lowering effect was found to be significantly different from the interaction between statins and ezetimibe. Ezetimibe was found to have a pharmacological-independent interaction resulting in additional LDL-C lowering over the entire statin dose range. The gemcabene interaction was found to be less than independent, resulting in almost no additional LDL-C lowering at high-statin doses, although the drug has a significant LDL-C effect when administered alone or in combination with a low dose of a statin. The quick availability of the model after completion of the first phase II trial in the target patient population and the ability of the team to explore the potential clinical efficacy and safety of gemcabene in comparison with alternative treatment options facilitated a quick decision to stop development.",

We report, here, that liver mitochondria isolated from hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout mice treated during 15 days with therapeutic doses (100 mg/kg, p.o.) of lovastatin presented a higher susceptibility to develop membrane permeability transition (MPT). In experiments in vitro, lovastatin-induced MPT in a dose-dependent manner (10-80 microM) by a mechanism sensitive to cyclosporin A (cyclophilin sequestrant), dithiothreitol (reducing agent), adenine nucleotide carrier inhibitor (ADP), catalase (H2O2 reductant) and EGTA (calcium chelator). In agreement with the inhibition of the mitochondrial swelling by dithiothreitol, lovastatin, also, decreased the content of total mitochondrial membrane protein thiol groups.

We aimed to establish whether fibrate-induced elevation of tHcy has also similar consequences and whether they may be prevented by folate co-administration. Eighteen subjects with hypercholesterolemia were included in an open, prospective, cross-over study. We compared intra-individually the effect of fenofibrate on tHcy, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction surrogates, in monotherapy and when combined with 10 mg of folate. These effects were also compared with fluvastatin monotherapy. Fenofibrate in monotherapy significantly decreased LDL cholesterol, increased the tHcy by 39.5 %, while oxidized LDL (oxLDL), malondialdehyde (MDA), von Willebrand factors (vWf) and thrombomodulin (TMD) remained unchanged. When fibrate was co-administered with folate, the tHcy remained on the initial post-diet level, while both the total and oxLDL as well as MDA, vWf and TMD decreased. In contrast to fenofibrate monotherapy, fluvastatin (80 mg) had a similar effect as combined therapy with fenofibrate and folate, while tHcy remained uninfluenced. In conclusion, fenofibrate decreases the LDL cholesterol, but in contrast to fluvastatin, has no significant antioxidative and endothelium-protective potential, probably due to a concomitant increase of tHcy. These effects may be improved by co-administration of folate.",

    "64": "The electrochemical reduction and adsorptive voltammetric behaviour of pravastatin have been studied by means of cyclic and square-wave voltammetry at a hanging mercury-drop electrode in electrolytes of different pH. Within the entire pH range (2.0-9.0) in Britton-Robinson buffer, pravastatin gave rise to a single voltammetric peak in the potential interval from -1.22 to -1.44 V, depending on pravastatin concentration. It was found that the reduction of pravastatin proceeds via a relatively stable intermediate, which is transformed to the final electroinactive product by a coupled chemical reaction or can be re-oxidized back to pravastatin. The rate of chemical transformation is controlled by the proton concentration. The electrode mechanism has the properties of a surface redox reaction. A sensitive analytical method for trace analysis of pravastatin based on the adsorptive stripping technique has been developed. The calibration plot was linear in the range 8x10(-8)-5x10(-7) mol L(-1). Application of the square-wave voltammetric method to determination of pravastatin in a pharmaceutical dosage form, without sample pretreatment, resulted in acceptable deviation from the stated concentration.",

Crfta/ggt_Ia is 1381-bp long and bears a 999-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 332 residues (FTA) that shares 66% identity with its Lycopersicon esculentum orthologue. Southern blot analysis revealed that FTA is encoded by a single gene copy per haploid genome. Co-expression of Crfta/ggt_Ia and Crftb encoding the beta-subunit of PFT yielded purified active recombinant PFT.

These findings have led to the intensive study of statins in cancer prevention, including recent, large population-based studies showing statin-associated reductions in overall, colorectal and prostate cancer. Understanding the complex cellular effects (for example, on angiogenesis and inflammation) and the underlying molecular mechanisms of statins (for example, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase-dependent processes that involve geranylgeranylation of Rho proteins, and HMG-CoA-independent processes that involve lymphocyte-function-associated antigen 1) will advance the development of molecularly targeted agents for preventing cancer. This understanding might also help the development of drugs for other ageing-related diseases with interrelated molecular pathways.",

Here, we discuss the clinical and experimental evidence underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of these agents.",

RT-PCR confirmed the expression of urocortin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Urocortin (10(-8) M) potently suppressed the generation of angiotensin II-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HUVECs. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma increased the urocortin mRNA levels and its release from HUVECs. Incubation with pitavastatin (0.1-3.0 microM) significantly increased the urocortin mRNA levels and its release from HUVECs. Furthermore, treatment with pitavastatin (2 mg/day) for 4 weeks increased the serum urocortin level from 11.0 +/- 6.5 to 16.4 +/- 7.3 ng/ml in healthy volunteers.",

Since average all-cause mortality risk in these patients is high (up to 27%), definitive diagnostics are recommended to screen all post-MI patients for ALVD, defined as left ventricular systolic dysfunction in the absence of heart failure symptoms. Post-MI management strategies for patients with ALVD target the two routes of progression to heart failure: (1) cardiac remodeling mediated by neurohormonal activation, and (2) continued and recurrent myocardial ischemic events. Clinical trials of neurohormonal antagonists in post-MI ALVD patients have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate left ventircular remodeling and that beta-blocker therapy reverses remodeling for patients already on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Neurohormonal antagonist therapy is also associated with significant reductions in sudden death in post-MI ALVD patients.",

Sprague-Dawley rats received 10 mg ATV.kg(-1).day(-1) added to drinking water or water alone for 3 days and received intravenous SC-58125, SC-560, 1400W, or vehicle alone. Anesthesia was induced with ketamine and xylazine and maintained with isoflurane. Fifteen minutes after intravenous injection rats underwent 30-min myocardial ischemia followed by 4-h reperfusion [infarct size (IS) protocol], or the hearts were explanted for biochemical analysis and immunoblotting. Left ventricular weight and area at risk (AR) were comparable among groups. ATV reduced IS to 12.7% (SD 3.1) of AR, a reduction of 64% vs. 35.1% (SD 7.6) in the sham-treated group (P < 0.001). SC-58125 and 1400W attenuated the protective effect without affecting IS in the non-ATV-treated rats. ATV increased calcium-independent NOS (iNOS) [11.9 (SD 0.8) vs. 3.9 (SD 0.1) x 1,000 counts/min; P < 0.001] and COX-2 [46.7 (SD 1.1) vs. 6.5 (SD 1.4) pg/ml of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha); P < 0.001] activity. Both SC-58125 and 1400W attenuated this increase. SC-58125 did not affect iNOS activity, whereas 1400W blocked iNOS activity. COX-2 was S-nitrosylated in ATV-treated but not sham-treated rats or rats pretreated with 1400W. COX-2 immunoprecipitated with iNOS but not with endothelial nitric oxide synthase. We conclude that ATV reduced IS by increasing the activity of iNOS and COX-2, iNOS is upstream to COX-2, and iNOS activates COX-2 by S-nitrosylation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that preconditioning effects are mediated via PG.", 
    "74": "The lipid-lowering drugs, 3-hydroxy-3-methylgulutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins, are used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that statins may exert vascular protective effects beyond cholesterol reduction. For example, statins improve endothelial function by cholesterol-dependent and -independent mechanisms. The cholesterol-independent or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins include the upregulation and activation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Because statins inhibit an early step in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, they also inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoids such as farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, which are important posttranslational lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules such as the Rho GTPases. Indeed, decrease in Rho GTPase responses as a consequence of statin treatment increases the production and bioavailability of endothelium-derived NO. The mechanism involves, in part, Rho/Rho-kinase (ROCK)-mediated changes in the actin cytoskeleton, which leads to decreases in eNOS mRNA stability. The regulation of eNOS by Rho GTPases, therefore, may be an important mechanism underlying the cardiovascular protective effect of statins.",

Some 50-70% of patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) involving PIs develop lipid abnormalities consisting of elevated levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides that are well-known risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Treatment of HIV dyslipidemia should include lifestyle modifications such as a low-fat diet, increased exercise, reduced alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. In many patients, however, these changes alone will not correct lipid levels. In some patients, changing the PI component of ART to another PI or non-PI and/or lipid-lowering drugs has proven successful. Each approach is associated with advantages and limitations and the need to maintain viral suppression must be balanced with the need to treat abnormal lipid levels.",

Cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, completely abolished TSA-induced decrease in eNOS expression, indicating that new protein synthesis is required for the inhibiting effect. Mevastatin--an inhibitor HMG-CoA reductase and geranylgeranylation reaction dose-dependently antagonized TSA-induced reduction.

As a result of the action of these cytokines and growth factors, chemoattraction of fibroblasts into the vessel wall and transdifferentiation of resident fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells into myofibroblasts occur leading to fibrosis and exaggerated collagen deposition in the vessel wall. To date, the therapeutic options for the vasculopathy of systemic sclerosis have been limited to drugs that cause vasodilation and inhibit platelet aggregation and only a few agents have shown vascular remodeling effects. Therapeutic agents that could potentially modify the course of this vasculopathy may have a disease-modifying effect, particularly, if instituted in the early stages of the disease. Extensive recent studies have shown that statins display numerous effects independent of their well-established lipid-lowering effect that may be of potential benefit in preventing vascular injury and ischemic vascular events. Here, we review the current literature, which suggests that statins may have a modifying effect on the vasculopathy of systemic sclerosis.",

The study is designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and utility of amlodipine/atorvastatin single-pill therapy in a real-world setting. Patients will be initiated at a dose of amlodipine 5 mg/atorvastatin 10 mg, unless previously treated, and will be uptitrated as necessary. The primary efficacy parameter is the percentage of patients, at different levels of cardiovascular risk, achieving country-specific guideline-recommended target levels for blood pressure and lipids. A secondary analysis of efficacy measured attainment of the same single goal for blood pressure across all study participants (JEWEL I and II) and the same single goal for LDL-C across all study participants (JEWEL I and II).

Twelve months simvastatin treatment, however, significantly improved EDD by 32.7% (4.9% vs. 6.5%, p=0.007). By regression analysis an individual adjusted increase in EDD during the simvastatin treatment period was seen (coefficient 0.132 a month, p=0.002). A significant reduction in total cholesterol of 31.0% (6.1+/-0.8 vs. 4.2+/-0.7, p<0.001) and LDL cholesterol of 42.6% (4.0+/-0.8 vs. 2.2+/-0.6, p<0.001) was observed.",

Although these drugs are generally well tolerated, severe adverse effects can occur in a minority of patients. Furthermore, a subset of patients does not respond to cholesterol-lowering therapy with a reduction in coronary heart disease progression. Significant progress has been made in the identification of common DNA sequence variations in genes influencing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins and in disease-modifying genes relevant for coronary heart disease (CHD). Among the most promising candidate genes for pharmacogenomic analysis of statin therapy are HMG-CoA reductase as a direct target gene and other genes modulating lipid and lipoprotein homeostasis. Based on data from pharmacogenetic trials, a combined analysis of multiple genetic variants in several genes is more likely to give significant results than single gene studies in small cohorts. In the future, pharmacogenomic testing may allow risk stratification of patients to avoid serious side effects and enable clinicians to select lipid-lowering drugs with the highest efficacy resulting in the best response to therapy.",

    "110": "Dyslipidemia is a common complication of progressive kidney disease and contributes to the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Recent evidence also suggests a role for dyslipidemia in the development and progression of renal disease. Experimental studies have demonstrated that lipids may induce glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury, and that lipid-lowering treatments ameliorate renal injury. Various lipid abnormalities have been associated with the development and progression of renal disease in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Population-based studies and studies of diabetic patients have reported associations of various lipid abnormalities with the development of renal disease. In patients with CKD, lipid abnormalities have also been associated with renal disease progression. Post hoc analyses of some large clinical trials on patients with vascular disease, diabetes, or dyslipidemia, and a meta-analysis of small, prospective, controlled studies on patients with CKD (diabetics and nondiabetics) suggest that statins may slow the progression of kidney disease. It is unclear whether the beneficial renal effects of statins are due to the reduction of serum cholesterol levels and/or their pleiotropic effects. There is also evidence for synergistic renoprotective effects between statins and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. According to the results of post hoc analysis of several studies, treatment with fibrates does not seem to confer renoprotection, but evidence is scarce. In summary, there is growing evidence that lipid abnormalities may be a risk factor for renal disease, and that statins appear to confer a renoprotective effect.", 
    "111": "End-stage renal disease is a social and economic threat worldwide. In this context, any medical intervention that may prevent the progression of chronic kidney disease becomes extremely important. Improving the cardiovascular status is another major objective in the management of this population, because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among dialysis patients. Moreover, this is only the tip of the iceberg, because many patients die before reaching end-stage renal disease. Today, several interventions are available to delay the progressive loss of renal function and/or prevent the development of cardiovascular disease, but we are still far from being satisfied. These interventions include low protein diets, correction of calcium-phosphate disorders and anemia, blood pressure and proteinuria control, and smoking cessation. Other interventions, such as the administration of lipid-lowering agents, are emerging as particularly promising therapeutic approaches. Recently, growing attention has been paid to polytherapeutic approaches to chronic kidney disease, in order to control different causal factors involved in progression and reduce them as much as possible. However, larger prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trials are needed to demonstrate their actual usefulness. All the interventions are likely to be more effective if performed as early as possible in the course of the disease, because it has been widely demonstrated that early and regular nephrologic care is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality.",

At the beginning of the study, after three months of PUFA supplementation and after another three months of placebo administration, concentrations of plasma lipids, composition of fatty acids, plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesterol esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG), concentration of tHcy, conjugated diens (CD) in LDL and selected inflammation indicators (IL-6, TNFalpha, VCAM-1) were determined. n-3 PUFA supplementation resulted in the significant decrease of tHcy concentration (-29%, P < 0.01) and TG (-28%, P < 0.05) in plasma. During the period of placebo administration, values returned to base line levels. CD concentration in LDL after n-3 PUFA increased by 15% (P < 0.15, not significant), meanwhile after the placebo containing oleic acid it decreased by 18% (P < 0.05).",

The clinical picture of rhabdymyolysis with acute renal failure caused by the use of simvastatin in a 54-year-old patient with diabetes mellitus and hypertension is described.", 
    "116": "Chemopreventive activities of farnesol (FOH) and geraniol (GOH) were evaluated during the initial phases of hepatocarcinogenesis. Rats received during eight consecutive weeks 25 mg/100 g body weight FOH (FOH group) or GOH (GOH group), or only corn oil (CO group, controls). Incidence (%) and mean number of visible hepatocyte nodules/animal were inhibited in FOH group (13% and 4 +/- 1; P < 0.05), but not in GOH group (42% and 18 +/- 17, P > 0.05), compared to CO group (100% and 42 +/- 17). Mean area (mm2) and % liver section area occupied by total hepatic placental glutathione S-transferase positive preneoplastic lesions (PNLs) were reduced in FOH group (0.09 +/- 0.06; 2.8 +/- 1.3; P < 0.05) compared to CO group (0.18 +/- 0.12; 10.0 +/- 2.8), while in GOH group only the mean area of these PNL was reduced (0.11 +/- 0.09; P < 0.05), but not the % liver section area occupied by them (5.1 +/- 1.1; P > 0.05). Compared to CO group, FOH and GOH groups showed reduced (P < 0.05) PNL cell proliferation and DNA damage, but only GOH group showed increased PNL apoptosis (P < 0.05). FOH group, but not GOH group, presented reduced (P < 0.05) total plasma cholesterol levels and increased (P < 0.05) hepatic levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase mRNA, compared to CO group. No differences (P > 0.05) were observed between CO, FOH and GOH regarding hepatic levels of farnesoid X activated receptor (FXR) protein. Results indicate that FOH and GOH could represent promising chemopreventive agents against hepatocarcinogenesis. Inhibition of cell proliferation and DNA damage relate to both isoprenoids' anticarcinogenic actions while induction of apoptosis specifically relates to GOH protective actions. Inhibition of HMGCoA reductase activity could be associated with FOH, but not GOH anticarcinogenic actions. FXR does not seem to be involved in the isoprenoids' chemopreventive activities.", 
    "117": "Macrophages play a part in pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, oxidizing LDL-cholesterol and transforming themselves in foam cells and producing free radicals of oxygen that may also oxidize LDL-cholesterol. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are very efficient in long-term control of atherogenesis acting by different mechanisms not fully established. Thus, we investigated the in vitro influence of pravastatin on phagocytosis and hydrogen peroxide production by monocytes of healthy individuals. Phagocytosis of Saccharomyces erevisiae by peripheral blood monocytes of 20 healthy individuals was assessed in the absence or presence of pravastatin. Hydrogen peroxide production was assessed based on the horseradish peroxidase-dependent oxidation of phenol red method. Pravastatin had no influence on phagocytosis through scavenger receptors, while it decreased by 20% the mean+/-SD phagocytic index of monocytes through complement receptors, from 141+/-77 to 113+/-56 (p=0.017), due to a decrease in the number of particles ingested by monocytes, from 2.1+/-0.5 to 1.7+/-0.3 (p=0.003). This statin also decreased the baseline production of hydrogen peroxide, by 7.7%, from 0.098+/-0.013 to 0.091+/-0.013 (OD by 2x10(5) monocytes per hour) (p=0.025). Pravastatin was able to decrease the phagocytosis through complement receptors and caused a decrease in the production of hydrogen peroxide by monocytes. It is possible this statin may directly inhibit the development of atherosclerotic plaque and its instability dependent on phagocytosis and the presence of reactive species of oxygen.", 
    "118": "The predominating theory on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) concerns the mis-metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP). As a result of this mis-metabolism, there is an increased production of the 42 amino acid form of beta-amyloid (Abeta42) that rapidly will form oligomers that initiates a cascade of events leading to the accumulation of amyloid plaques. Commonly recognised as vascular factors, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes and the inheritance of the epsilon4 allele of the APOE gene, are also risk factors for AD. These risks have been found to promote the production of Abeta42. An association between cholesterol and the development of AD was suggested in the early 1990s and ever since, an increasing amount of research has confirmed that there is a link between cholesterol and the development of AD. A high cholesterol levels in mid-life is a risk for AD and statins, i.e., cholesterol-lowering drugs, reduce this risk. Statins may not only inhibit enzymes involved in the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol but also affect enzymes involved in Abeta metabolism, i.e., alpha-secretase and beta-secretase. This normalises the breakdown of APP thereby promoting the non-amyloidogenic pathway. In this review, investigations focusing on cholesterol and Alzheimer's disease are presented.", 
    "119": "Hyperlipidemia continues to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, particularly coronary heart disease, in the elderly population. Despite the fact that hyperlipidemia does not seem to be a major risk factor for stroke, therapy for hyperlipidemia, especially with statins, has clearly been demonstrated to reduce both coronary heart disease events and stroke, with the most convincing data being for the elderly population. Although we review some safety concerns with statin therapy applicable to the elderly, statins alone or with other proved therapies, including fibrates, niacin, and exercise training, have been demonstrated to reduce major cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and stroke in the elderly. In addition, this therapy can be safely administered to most elderly patients and seems to have either neutral or slightly beneficial effects on dementia. Therefore, aggressive lipid treatment, particularly with statins, is needed in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly.",

The plaques in the untreated high-cholesterol group demonstrated advanced atherosclerotic lesions. On the other hand, the diet withdrawal and statin therapy groups showed histologic characteristics of stabilization, including the resolution of macrophage infiltration and an increase in smooth muscle cell content.

The probability of resuming statin treatment was 51% within 24 months after last prescription filled. The proportion of adherent users stayed stable, between 53% and 55%, after the first 6 months. Risk factors of treatment discontinuation, treatment resumption, and adherence were remarkably similar and were stable over time. The significant predictors of treatment discontinuation were age <50 years (hazard ratio [HR], 1.45 [95% Cl, 1.26-1.68]), female sex (HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.06-1.30], and previous antihyperlipidemia treatment (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.63-0.79]).",

    "133": "Dyslipemia is a clear risk factor (RF) for ischemic heart disease and peripheral artery disease, but its relation with ischemic stroke (IS) is not so clear. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor drugs or statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin) reduce the relative risk of IS by between 18 and 51% in patients with IHD, in patients with high vascular disease risk and in hypertensive patients with other RFs, acute coronary syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. According to the guidelines for use, statins are indicated in the majority of patients with IS since the risk is equivalent to that of IHD or high vascular disease risk. In view of the existing clinical evidence of benefit, it would not seem unreasonable to proceed with treatment of patients using statins while awaiting specific studies justifying their use. The non-lipid-lowering mechanisms of the statins and results of studies, such as the Heart Protection Study, provide evidence for widening the indications of statins beyond the prevention of dyslipemia, as a new therapeutic approach in the prevention of IS in patients with plasma levels of total cholesterol or low density lipoproteins currently considered within the normal distribution. The neuroprotective role, which these drugs may play in the acute phase of cerebral ischemia, remains to be clarified, but very recent evidence suggests that such patients may also benefit.", 
    "134": "Macrophages participate in several inflammatory pathologies such as sepsis and arthritis. We examined the effect of simvastatin on the LPS-induced proinflammatory macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Co-treatment of LPS and a non-toxic dose of simvastatin induced cell death in RAW264.7 cells. The cell death was accompanied by disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), genomic DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation. Surprisingly, despite caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade being completely blocked by Z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, the cell death was only partially repressed. In the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, DNA fragmentation was blocked, but DNA condensation, disruption of MMP, and nuclear translocation of apoptosis inducing factor were obvious. The cell death by simvastatin and LPS was effectively decreased by both the FPP and GGPP treatments as well as mevalonate. Our findings indicate that simvastatin triggers the cell death of LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells through both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways, suggesting a novel mechanism of statins for the severe inflammatory disease therapy.",

    "149": "(1) The TC and LDL-C decreased after treatment in the 3 groups with significant differences between Group A and Group C, Group B and Group C, and Group B and Group C (all P < 0.05). (2) The plasma level of hsCRP decreased by 9.1%, 33.9%, and 30.1% respectively 7 days after treatment in Groups A, B, and C with significant differences between Groups A and B and between Groups A and C (both P < 0.05), however, without significant difference between Group B and Group C. The level of hsCRP decreased by 34.3%, 56.0%, and 52.9% respectively 14 days after treatment in the 3 groups with significant differences between Groups A and B and between Groups A and C (both P < 0.05), however, without significant difference between Group B and Group C. (3) The level of IL-6 decreased 7 and 14 days after treatment in all 3 groups, however, without significant differences between any 2 groups (all P > 0.05). (4) The decrease of hsCRP and decrease of IL-6 were not correlated with the percentage of TC decrease (both P > 0.05) in Group B. The decrease of hsCRP was not correlated with the changes of blood lipids in Group C. (5) Both the plasma hsCRP and IL-6 before treatment were positively correlated with the infection volume and neurological function score (all P < 0.01).",

    "151": "Cardio-vascular diseases are a major contributor to mortality, morbidity and functional decline in the elderly population. Hypercholesterolemia remains a major risk factor in older persons, but treatment decisions are difficult because of the paucity of data specific to this segment of the population. While evidence seems strong enough to support treating patients with cardio-vascular diseases (secondary prevention) up to their eighties, the question remains open whether to treat asymptomatic older patients (primary prevention) or those in their nineties.", 
    "152": "Cell adhesion molecules (CAM) play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis by mediating the binding of leukocytes to the endothelium. Soluble CAM isoforms are known to be elevated in the sera of patients suffering from coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "153": "We measured the concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in the blood of 47 CAD patients before and 6 months after starting statin therapy and in 16 untreated CAD patients. The progression of CAD was monitored by calculating the coronary calcium score using electron beam computed tomography.",

None of the other proteins studied showed significant changes. In contrast to hs-CRP, the reduction of soluble P-selectin concentrations correlated directly with the lowering of total cholesterol (r(2) = 0.236, p < 0.005) and inversely with the progression of CAD (r(2) = 0.393, p < 0.0001).",

    "157": "One hundred sixteen hypercholesterolemic patients were prospectively screened by physical examination, medical history, and clinical laboratory evaluation and were included in this study. Subjects entering the study were treated with 20 mg/d simvastatin. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels were measured before treatment, after 2 months of treatment, and after 6 months of treatment. Ninety-nine patients completed the 6-month follow-up and were included in the association analysis for treatment efficacy. Seventeen subjects who had adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to simvastatin (ADR group) could not complete the 6-month follow-up and were included in the association analyses for safety. Myalgia was observed in 15 of 17 subjects and was the only ADR included in the association analyses, but other common ADRs were also observed. Myalgia was defined as proximal or diffuse muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, or both pain and weakness, with normal or slightly increased serum creatine phosphokinase levels. ABCB1 (1236C>T, 2677G>A/T, and 3435C>T), CYP3A4 (-392A>G), and CYP3A5 (6986A>G) allele variants were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction mapping.", 
    "158": "After adjustment for covariates, carriers of the ABCB1 1236T variant allele had a greater reduction in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with simvastatin treatment, as compared with homozygotes with the wild-type allele (-29.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), -25.9 to -32.5] versus -24.2% [95% CI, -19.0 to -29.3] [P = .042] and -39.6% [95% CI, -35.8 to -44.0] versus -33.8% [95% CI, -27.4 to -40.2] [P = .042], respectively). Similar results were observed for the 2677G>A/T polymorphism and haplotype data. The 1236T, 2677non-G, and 3435T alleles were less frequent in ADR cases than in the non-ADR group (P < .05 for all single-nucleotide polymorphisms). Haplotype analyses also demonstrated a reduction of the T-non-G-T haplotype frequency (20%) in patients in whom myalgia developed during simvastatin treatment, as compared with the non-ADR group (41.4%) (P = .03). No significant associations were observed between the CYP3A4 -392A>G and CYP3A5*3 allele variants and the efficacy or tolerability of simvastatin.",

    "160": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic immuno-inflammatory disease involving the recruitment of monocytes and T lymphocytes to the vascular wall of arteries. Chemokines and their receptors, known to induce leukocyte migration, have recently been implicated in atherogenesis. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors) have anti-inflammatory properties beyond their lipid-lowering effects. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether simvastatin reduces the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors in two major cell types implicated in atherogenesis and to test isoprenoid intermediates involved in their regulation.", 
    "161": "We performed in vitro experiments on human vascular endothelial cells and human primary macrophages. First, we have shown by ELISA that 1 microM simvastatin significantly reduced MCP-1 in endothelial cells (ECs) and macrophages stimulated with TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma, respectively. Messenger RNA analysis revealed that expression of the chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta, as well as the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, CCR4 and CCR5, was decreased by simvastatin, both in ECs and macrophages. Furthermore, the statin effects were reversed by mevalonate and mimicked by the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI), whereas the farnesyl transeferase inhibitor (FTI) had no effect. These results suggests that statins act via inhibition of the geranylgeranylation of proteins.", 
    "162": "Our results demonstrate that statins reduce chemokine and chemokine receptor expressions in human ECs and macrophages via inhibition of the geranylgeranylpyrophosphate pathway. Thus, our data provide further evidence that statins have anti-inflammatory properties beyond their lipid-lowering effects. These findings highlight specific novel therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases to reduce inflammation mediated by chemokines and their receptors.",

Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and western-blot were employed to examine the changes of the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-beta1 and Tbeta II R in the kidneys of the rats.", 
    "165": "Compared with the normal control group, both the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-beta1 and Tbeta II R in the diabetic rat group and treatment group were significantly increased (P < 0.05). Compared with the diabetic rat group, simvastatin could markedly decrease the mRNA and protein expression of TGF-beta1 and Tbeta II R (P < 0.05).",

    "167": "Making statin available over the counter is one of the measures proposed to correct its underuse. Since May 2004, simvastatin 10 mg is sold over the counter in Great Britain. But uncertainties persist concerning the efficacy of statin in primary prevention and at a 10 mg dose. Finally, there is a risk of side effects and drug interactions. Beyond the correction of statin underuse and the hope of coronary heart disease mortality reduction, the British decision highlighted the will to give individuals a sense of responsibility concerning their health and its financial cost. Anyway, the benefit of switching statin from prescription to over the counter should be experimentally evaluated before its introduction.", 
    "168": "An optimal level of NO has protective effects in atherosclerosis, whereas large amounts contribute to septic shock. To study how statins, the potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, regulate NO in the vascular wall, we determined their effects on interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NO production in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Compared with the large amounts of NO and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein expression induced by LPS, the responses of IL-1beta were modest. Various statins were found to inhibit LPS-induced iNOS expression and NO production, although they potentiated IL-1beta responses. In addition, fluvastatin increased IL-1beta-induced p65 nuclear translocation and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity, although it inhibited those induced by LPS. To address the role of small G proteins in statin's actions, farnesyl transferase inhibitors [alpha-hydroxyfarne-sylphosphonic acid and (2S)-2-[[(2S)-2-[(2S,3S)-2-[(2R)-2-amino-3-mercaptopropyl]amino]-3-methylpentyl]oxy]-1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl]amino]-4-(methylsulfonyl)-butanoic acid 1-methylethyl ester (L-744382)], Rac inhibitor (NSC23766), and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor [N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide dihydrochloride (Y-27632)] were used. We found that Y-27632 potentiated IL-1beta-induced iNOS expression, p65 nuclear translocation, IkappaB kinase (IKK), and NF-kappaB activation, whereas it had minimal effects on LPS-induced responses. In contrast, farnesyl transferase inhibitors blocked iNOS protein expression induced by LPS and IL-1beta, whereas NSC23766 had no effect. Further studies showed that LPS down-regulated Rho and ROCK activity, whereas IL-1beta increased them, suggesting a negative role of Rho and ROCK signaling, which is regulated in contrary manners by IL-1beta and LPS, in IKK/NF-kappaB activation. Through abrogating this negative signaling, statins differentially regulate iNOS expression induced by LPS and IL-1beta in VSMCs. These differential actions of statins on iNOS gene regulation might provide an additional explanation for the pleiotropic beneficial effects of statins.", 
    "169": "Randomized clinical trials may not accurately predict drug benefit in clinical practice because the patients and conditions of therapy almost always differ between those settings.", 
    "170": "To determine whether differences in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) time curves between clinical trial results and usual care experience after initiation of statin therapy could be explained fully in terms of observable characteristics of patients and practice in usual care.", 
    "171": "We compared LDL-C measurements for 3 years after initiation of statin treatment in individuals enrolled in a health maintenance organization (HMO), with enrollees in the active treatment arm of the CARE (Cholesterol and Recurrent Events) trial. Analysis of the determinants of variation in LDL-C in the HMO cohort was used to adjust the crude results to the distribution of patient and treatment characteristics in the trial.", 
    "172": "The mean percent decrease in LDL-C was lower in the HMO cohort (n = 1245) than in the clinical trial at the end of each 6-month period, with the difference diminishing over time. Adjustment of the HMO time curve to the baseline characteristics of the clinical trial cohort did not significantly change the mean estimates at any time point. Assuming optimal adherence in the HMO cohort raised the curve over time, with 95% confidence intervals including the means observed in CARE after 18 months. Fixing treatment to pravastatin 40 mg/day, as in CARE, brought the estimates in the HMO cohort very close to those of the clinical trial, with 95% confidence intervals including the means observed in CARE at all time points.", 
    "173": "Treatment selection, dosing, and adherence under usual care were the primary reasons for which improvements in LDL-C in practice fell short of expectations that are based on clinical trial findings for statin therapy. Beginning with a low dose of statins and titrating to a satisfactory response can delay effective treatment by 18 months or more. Poor adherence accounts for a further substantial shortfall from maximal effect. Differences between trial populations and the general population of statin users with respect to age, gender, and baseline LDL-C have no measurable impact on discrepancies between predicted and observed LDL-C improvement in usual practice.", 
    "174": "Microvascular dysfunction posttreatment of stroke with recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rht-PA) constrains the therapeutic window to 3 hours. Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) promote vascular thrombolysis and reduce the inflammation response. We therefore investigated the neuroprotective effects of a combination of atorvastatin and delayed rht-PA treatment in a rat model of embolic stroke.", 
    "175": "Rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion were treated with atorvastatin in combination with rht-PA 4 hours after stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging measurements revealed that combination treatment with atorvastatin and rht-PA blocked the expansion of the ischemic lesion, which improved neurological function compared with saline-treated rats. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of single endothelial cells isolated by laser-capture microdissection from brain tissue and immunostaining showed that combination treatment downregulated expression of tissue factor, von Willebrand factor, protease-activated receptor-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9, which concomitantly reduced cerebral microvascular thrombosis and enhanced microvascular integrity. Combination treatment did not increase cerebrovascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels or eNOS activity, and inhibition of NOS activity with N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester did not block the beneficial effects of combination treatment on stroke. Furthermore, combination treatment compared with thrombolytic monotherapy increased cerebral blood flow and reduced infarct volume in eNOS-null mice.", 
    "176": "These data demonstrate that combination treatment with atorvastatin and rht-PA exerts a neuroprotective effect when administered 4 hours after stroke and that the therapeutic benefits are likely attributed to its multitargeted effects on cerebrovascular patency and integrity.",

A total cholesterol >175 mg/dl was found in 76% of patients and an LDL cholesterol >100 mg/dl in 83%. Finally, median hs-CRP was 4.8 mg/l (interquartile range 2.5-13.9 mg/l).

    "182": "Lovastatin inhibits a 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and prevents the synthesis of cholesterol precursors, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), responsible for important cell signaling in cell proliferation and migration. Recently, the anti-cancer effect of lovastatin has been suggested in various tumor types. In this study, we showed that a low dose lovastatin induced senescence and G1 cell cycle arrest in human prostate cancer cells. Addition of GGPP or mevalonate, but not FPP, prevented the lovastatin-induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest and cell senescence. We found that constitutively active RhoA (caRhoA) reversed lovastatin-induced senescence in caRhoA-transfected PC-3 cells. Thus, we postulate that modulation of RhoA may be critical in lovastatin-induced senescence in PC-3 cells.", 
    "183": "Diabetic nephropathy is commonly associated with dyslipidemia, but the role of lipids in the progression of this disorder remains unresolved. In particular, the role of lipid-lowering drugs, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and fibrates, as renoprotective agents is not clarified. Experimental studies have demonstrated that dietary lipids promote renal injury and that statins, independent of their lipid-lowering effects, confer renoprotection via effects on intrarenal hemodynamics and renal cytokine and chemokine expression. Clinical studies have in general been underpowered, but a recent meta-analysis and findings from the Heart Protection Study suggest that statins may be renoprotective. Nevertheless, with the convincing antiatherosclerotic effects of these agents, including in the setting of diabetes, they should be widely administered in the diabetic population with or at risk for nephropathy.",

His condition was complicated with asymptomatic coronary artery disease in 1992. His coronary artery disease gradually progressed during the subsequent 13 years of observation, and he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention four times and also received a coronary artery bypass graft. This is a case of metabolic syndrome with multiple risk factors for arteriosclerosis as visceral obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, in which the recent rapid progression of coronary artery disease might be associated with the discontinuation of statin after coronary artery bypass graft, accompanied with hyper-LDL-choleterolemia. Patients with metabolic syndrome require most comprehensive and strict therapies against multiple risk factors.",

A striking difference was found for statins: 9% in the very old and 72% in younger patients. The pattern of drug use generally remained unchanged after 2.5 years. Survival rates for patients >or=80 and <80 years: at discharge 72 versus 90%, after 2.5 years 34 versus 73%.",

We hereby report a patient proved to be a case of unrecognized hypothyroidism presenting with rhabdomyolytic acute renal failure precipitated by the combined use of statin and fenofibrate. A 63-year-old woman was referred to our department because of fatigue, diffuse muscle pain and oliguria. On the basis of pathogenesis, clinical and laboratory examination the diagnoses of acute renal failure secondary to the statin-fibrate-derivative combination induced rhabdomyolysis and auto-immune thyroiditis induced hypothyroidism were made. Although saline, furosemide and sodium bicarbonate infusions enabled diuresis and have led to a rapid recovery of renal function and normalization of blood pressure in five days (creatinine level decreased from 4.5 mg/dl to 1.2 mg/dl), only thyroid replacement therapy (0,1 mg thyroxine) that begun after the exclusion of adrenal insufficiency resulted in complete resolution of rhabdomyolysis. This prompted the diagnosis of background, clinically silent rhabdomyolysis aggrevated by the statin-fibrate-derivative combination. To our knowledge this case illustrates the first example of rhabdomyolytic acute renal failure induced by a statin-fibrate-derivative combination with underlying hypothyroidism which was responsible for the basal clinically unobservable rhabdomyolysis."
