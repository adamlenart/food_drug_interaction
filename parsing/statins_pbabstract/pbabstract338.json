To study the relationship between cell cycle progression and TRAIL-induced apoptosis, SW480 colon cancer and H460 lung cancer cell lines were examined for their sensitivity to TRAIL after arrest in different cell cycle phases. Cells were synchronized in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase by serum starvation, aphidicolin, or nocodazole treatment, respectively. We found that arrest of cells in G0/G1 phase confers significantly higher susceptibility to TRAIL-induced apoptosis as compared to cells in late G1, S, or G2/M phase. To determine if cell cycle phase could be harnessed for therapeutic gain in the presence of TRAIL, we used the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, Simvastatin and lovastatin, to enrich a cancer cell population in G0/G1. Both simvastatin and lovastatin significantly augmented TRAIL-induced apoptosis in tumor cells, but not in normal keratinocytes. The results indicate that TRAIL, in combination with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of human cancer.", 
    "1": "Previous studies have demonstrated the immunomodulatory potential of Lovastatin, a hydroxy methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, in lessening the clinical and histological manifestations in the neuroinflammatory animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Neurosci. Lett., 269 (1999) 71, and J. Neurosci. Res., 66 (2001) 155). To determine the mechanism behind the observed amelioration of EAE by Lovastatin, we examined the cytokine profile of stimulated splenocytes from control, EAE and Lovastatin treated EAE rats. Splenocytes from Lovastatin-treated EAE rats showed decreased levels of interferon-gamma, a Th1 type cytokine, while interleukin (IL)-10, a Th2 type cytokine, was markedly increased as compared to untreated EAE animals. In addition, we also observed reduced levels of IL-6 and nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated splenocytes isolated from Lovastatin-treated animals. This study documents for the first time that Lovastatin induces a bias towards Th2 cytokines ex vivo, and as a result may be of therapeutic value for cell-mediated diseases such as multiple sclerosis.", 
    "2": "Both statins and vitamin E, by reducing the rate of lipid peroxidation, may interfere with oxidative stress, but the impact of their combination is unknown.", 
    "3": "We randomized 43 hypercholesterolemic patients (21 men, 22 women, age 63+/-11 years) to either simvastatin, to achieve >20% reduction of total cholesterol, or simvastatin plus 600 mg/d vitamin E for 2 months. Patients were then crossed over to the alternative treatment. Lipid parameters documented patients' compliance to simvastatin, whereas plasma levels of vitamin E documented compliance and absorption of vitamin E. We assessed urinary excretion of the isoprostane 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2alpha) (8-iso-PGF(2alpha)) as an in vivo index of oxidative stress at baseline and after each month of therapy. 8-Iso-PGF(2alpha) was significantly reduced by simvastatin, from 361+/-148 pg/mg creatinine (mean+/-SD) at baseline to 239+/-124 pg/mg creatinine after 1 month. The addition of vitamin E did not reduce such levels any further (256+/-125 after 1 month). Linear regression analysis showed a weak inverse relationship of 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) with vitamin E levels but a much stronger relationship with LDL cholesterol (R(2)=0.162; P<0.001).", 
    "4": "In hypercholesterolemic patients, LDL cholesterol is a major correlate of oxidative stress. Concomitant with LDL cholesterol reduction, simvastatin causes a drastic reduction of oxidative stress to a level that is not further reduced by the addition of vitamin E. Results of clinical trials with vitamin E may have been hampered by inadequate knowledge of the background level of lipid peroxidation, which is a major determinant of vitamin E bioactivity.",

    "7": "The CMRI measurements were taken four and 12 weeks after left coronary artery ligation in a 7.05-tesla Biospec. The MI size, LV mass and volumes, cardiac output (CO), and ejection fraction were determined. Rats were treated for 12 weeks with either placebo (P), cerivastatin (C; 0.6 mg/kg body weight per day) as a dietary supplement, or cerivastatin plus the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-methyl-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 76 mg/100 ml) and hydralazine (8 mg/100 ml) in drinking water (CLH) to assess the contribution of endogenous nitric oxide formation.",

Indices of allograft rejection including treated rejection, rejection with hemodynamic compromise, noncellular rejection, and mean one-year biopsy score were compared between the two cohorts, as well as with a statin-naive control population (n = 37). Lipid levels, safety, and post-transplant outcomes were also assessed as secondary end points.", 
    "13": "We found no significant differences in any allograft rejection parameter between the two groups. However, total low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides, were lower in the simvastatin arm (-23% vs. -11%, p = 0.02). No cases of rhabdomyolysis or myositis occurred in either group. Survival at one year was similar in both treatment groups (91% for patients on pravastatin and 92% for patients on simvastatin). Both groups had better survival compared with the statin-naive control group (80%, p = 0.04).", 
    "14": "Simvastatin (10 mg/day) and pravastatin (20 mg/day) are associated with similar beneficial effects on cardiac allograft rejection and one-year survival. At these doses, simvastatin decreases LDL cholesterol more so than pravastatin with no increase in adverse effects in heart transplantation.", 
    "15": "Mevalonate depletion by inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase impairs post-translational processing of Ras and Ras-related proteins. We have previously shown that this mevalonate depletion also leads to the upregulation of Ras, Rap1a, RhoA, and RhoB. This upregulation may result from global inhibition of isoprenylation or depletion of key regulatory isoprenoid species. Studies utilizing specific isoprenoid pyrophosphates in mevalonate-depleted cells reveal that farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) restores Ras processing and prevents RhoB upregulation while geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) restores Rap1a processing and prevents RhoA and RhoB upregulation. Either FPP or GGPP completely prevents lovastatin-induced upregulation of RhoB mRNA. Inhibition of FPP or squalene synthase allowed for the further identification of the putative regulatory species. Studies involving the specific isoprenyl transferase inhibitors FTI-277 and GGTI-286 demonstrate that selective inhibition of protein isoprenylation does not mimic lovastatin's ability to increase Ras and RhoA synthesis, decrease Ras and RhoA degradation, increase RhoB mRNA, or increase total levels of Ras, Rap1a, RhoA, and RhoB. In aggregate, these findings reveal a novel role and mechanism for isoprenoids to influence levels of Ras and Ras-related proteins.", 
    "16": "We report a patient with renal insufficiency who developed rhabdomyolysis 1 month after initiating cerivastatin and gemfibrozil for hyperlipidemia. Myopathy caused by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) alone is rare, but occurs more frequently when a statin is used with gemfibrozil, a medication that likely has a direct toxic effect on muscles. Predisposing factors to the development of myopathy from the combination include use of medications affecting statin metabolism, higher doses of statins, renal insufficiency, diuretics, and hypothyroidism. It has been proposed that alternate-day therapy with a statin and fibrate, spacing of doses in a single day, or use of lower doses of statins may prevent the development of myopathy. Currently, no predictable method to determine who is at risk for myopathy exists, nor is there a reliable screening test. Therefore, patients should be advised to watch for generalized muscle pain or weakness, and if it occurs, stop medications and report symptoms immediately.",

    "18": "Miniature pigs were treated for 21 days with 10 mg/kg/day of SC-435 or placebo. SC-435 decreased plasma cholesterol by 9% and LDL cholesterol by 20% with no effect on other lipids. Autologous (131)I-VLDL, (125)I-LDL, and [(3)H]-leucine were injected simultaneously to determine apoB kinetics. LDL apoB concentrations decreased significantly by 10% resulting entirely from an increase in LDL-apoB fractional catabolic rate. SC-435 had no effect on either total LDL apoB production or VLDL apoB converted to LDL. SC-435 increased VLDL apoB production by 22%; however, the concentration was unchanged as a result of increased VLDL apoB direct removal. SC-435 increased hepatic mRNA and enzymatic activity for both cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and HMG-CoA reductase. Hepatic LDL receptor mRNA increased significantly, whereas apoB expression was unaffected.",

CRP values were adjusted for age, body mass index, vitamin use, statin medication use, aspirin use, the presence of inflammatory disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, and smoking habit. We found an inverse association of CRP across fitness levels (P for trend<0.001), with the highest adjusted CRP value in the lowest fitness quintile (1.64 [1.27 to 2.11] mg/L) and the lowest adjusted CRP value in the highest fitness quintile (0.70 [0.60 to 0.80] mg/L). Similar results were found for the prevalence of elevated CRP across fitness quintiles. We used logistic regression to model the adjusted odds for elevated CRP and found that compared with the referent first quintile, the second (odds ratio [OR] 0.43, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85), third (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.65), fourth (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.47), and fifth (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.37) quintiles of fitness had significantly lower odds of elevated CRP.

    "24": "Simvastatin (50 mg/kg per day) was administered to 30-week-old apolipoprotein E-deficient mice exhibiting advanced unstable atherosclerotic lesions within the innominate/brachiocephalic artery. Simvastatin was administered in the chow to separate groups of mice for 6, 12, 18, or 24 weeks. Simvastatin significantly increased serum cholesterol after 12, 18, and 24 weeks of treatment. The average cross-sectional area of atherosclerotic lesion increased in the innominate artery after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, concomitant with the increase in serum cholesterol. However, histological analysis of sections of the innominate artery stained with Movat and von Kossa stains demonstrated a 49% reduction in the frequency of intraplaque hemorrhage and a 56% reduction in the frequency of calcification, both markers of advanced and unstable atherosclerotic plaques.",

We have investigated the effects of these drugs on cytokine-stimulated CD40 expression in human cultured endothelial cells and monocytes.", 
    "27": "Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis revealed that treatment of either cell type with atorvastatin, cerivastatin, or pravastatin (1 to 10 micromol/L) inhibited interferon-gamma plus tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated CD40 expression by approximately 50%, an effect that was not reversed by the HMG-CoA reductase product mevalonic acid (400 micromol/L). In contrast, mevalonic acid prevented the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on cytokine-stimulated vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression and subsequent adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to the cultured endothelial cells. Transcription factor analysis revealed an inhibition by atorvastatin of nuclear factor-kappaB plus signal transducer and activator of transcription-1-dependent de novo synthesis of interferon regulatory factor-1, governing cytokine-stimulated CD40 expression in these cells. One consequence of this statin-dependent downregulation of CD40 expression was a decrease in CD40 ligand-induced endothelial interleukin-12 expression.", 
    "28": "By interfering with cytokine-stimulated CD40 expression in vascular cells, statins thus seem capable of attenuating CD40 ligand-induced proinflammatory responses, including atherosclerosis. In addition, they point to the coexistence of HMG-CoA reductase-dependent and -independent effects of statins in the same cell type.", 
    "29": "Ezetimibe is the first member of a new class of selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors, compounds that effectively block intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol, without affecting absorption of fat soluble vitamins or triglycerides. Ezetimibe underwent glucuronidation to a single metabolite and localised at the intestinal wall, where it prevented luminal cholesterol absorption. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated the lipid-lowering and antiatherosclerotic properties of ezetimibe. The efficacy and safety of ezetimibe monotherapy have been determined in phase II/III studies: in phase II studies, the optimal efficacy was reached with ezetimibe 10 mg per day and the pooled efficacy data have shown that ezetimibe 10 mg has a positive effect on the lipoprotein profile with a significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol of 18.5%, an increase in HDL-cholesterol of 3.5% and a trend towards lowering in triglyceride concentrations (-4.9%). The monotherapy phase III studies have confirmed the efficacy with a decrease in LDL-C of 17.4% and have demonstrated an excellent safety and tolerability profile. The potential for a pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic interaction between ezetimibe and various statins and the efficacy and safety or the co-administration of ezetimibe and statins have been evaluated in different phase I/II studies: ezetimibe had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin or atorvastatin. Ezetimibe 10 mg co-administrated with the starting dose of any statin induced a mean 18% additive LDL-C lowering effect. This additive 18% reduction in LDL-C is achieved in one step compared with the three steps necessary with statin monotherapy.",

The authors investigated the ratio of chronically treated patients and the proportion of the following groups of patients according to their annual consumption in 1995-1999: group of of drug \"vacation\" (0 DDD) and the group with a low (< 121.7 DDD), medium (< 243.3 & > 121.7 DDD) and optimal (> 243.3 DDD) consumption of hypolipidaemics and their relationship to sex and age. For statistical ealuation software SPSS 10.1 was used.", 
    "33": "In the course of the investigation among the insured subjects the statin consumption increased 76 times and the consumption of fibrates 5 times. The ratio of consumption of resin derivatives and of nicotinic acid was negligible. The size of the group of subjects treated with hypolipidaemics for longer than one year increased from 0.8% in 1995 to 2.2% of the database. The average age increased from 55 to 59 years. The ratio of seniors (> or = 65 years) increased in the course of the investigation and reached 33% in 1999 of all members of the investigated group. The mean annual consumption of hypolipidaemics increased significantly as compared with 1995 and the interannual increase as compared with the previous year was statistically significant in 1997 and 1999. In 1999 it was 237 DDD/per consumer. A lower consumption was recorded in women and in seniors. Drug \"vacations\" were recorded in 6% of the insured subjects of the group and the frequency did not change significantly in the course of the investigation and no relationship with age and sex was found. A low exposure according to DDD was found in 20%, medium exposure in about 40% and optimal exposure in only one third of the subjects of the investigated group.", 
    "34": "The authors developed a method which makes it possible, when individual data of the health insurance company are available, to investigate the theoretical exposure to hypolipidaemics in insured subjects treated on a long-term basis with these drugs. The authors provided evidence that analysis of the database of the health insurance company can provide certain signals for further pharmacoepidemiological research and for application in a defined medical discipline. Some of the insured subjects are exposed to smaller doses than theoretically assumed. It is necessary to extend the investigation so that the results will better reflect the population of patients and prescribing physicians. Complete evaluation of cases with a low exposure from the aspect of morbidity and drug compliance will be also essential.", 
    "35": "Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering drug that inhibits the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol by blocking passage across the intestinal wall. The efficacy and safety of adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study group included 769 adults (aged > or =18 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia who had not achieved National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel II goals with dietary alteration and statin monotherapy. Patients receiving a stable dose of a statin for > or =6 weeks were randomized to receive concurrent treatment with placebo (n = 390) or ezetimibe (n = 379), 10 mg/day, in addition to continuing their open-label statin for 8 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline with statin monotherapy to end point after intervention (secondary variables: high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglycerides). Ongoing statin therapy plus ezetimibe led to changes of -25.1% for LDL cholesterol (HDL cholesterol +2.7%; triglycerides -14.0%) compared with LDL cholesterol -3.7% (p <0.001), HDL cholesterol +1.0% (p <0.05), and triglycerides -2.9% (p <0.001) for placebo added to ongoing statin therapy. Among patients not at LDL cholesterol goal at on-statin baseline, 71.5% receiving statin plus ezetimibe versus 18.9% receiving statin plus placebo reached goal at end point (odds ratio 23.7; p <0.001). The co-administration of statin and ezetimibe was generally well tolerated. Adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy led to substantial additional reduction in LDL cholesterol levels, facilitating attainment of NCEP goals. Ezetimibe offers a new therapeutic option for patients receiving statins who require further reduction in LDL cholesterol.", 
    "36": "In our laboratory, we recently obtained evidence that cultured bovine endothelial cells contain cytosolic proteins that form complexes with the 3'-unstranslated region of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and are associated with its destabilization. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of such proteins and the level of eNOS expression in hypercholesterolemic rabbits as an in vivo model of endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "37": "Endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to acetylcholine was reduced in aortic segments from hypercholesterolemic rabbits compared with controls. Treatment of hypercholesterolemic rabbits with simvastatin (25 mg/kg body weight/day) restored endothelium-dependent relaxation. Aortic eNOS expression was reduced in hypercholesterolemic rabbits and was accompanied by enhanced binding activity of a 60-KDa cytosolic protein and reduced stability of eNOS mRNA. Simvastatin treatment upregulated eNOS expression and reduced the interaction of cytosolic protein with the 3'-untranslated region of eNOS mRNA.", 
    "38": "These results demonstrate the presence of a 60-KDa protein that binds to eNOS mRNA and reduces eNOS expression in the vascular wall.", 
    "39": "Today, statins play an important role in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. They have two effects on the metabolism of cholesterol: firstly, they reduce the synthesis of cholesterol and secondly they stimulate the expression of LDL receptors. LDL is reduced via both of the mechanisms. Various studies (the 4S, LIPID and CARE studies) have demonstrated the efficacy of statins in secondary prevention, that is, in patients with hypercholesterolemia and CAD. In the CARE study, for example, the statins reduced the incidence of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions by 24%. A number of studies show that although primary prevention is effective, long-term tolerability is still a matter of controversy. A relatively frequent, dose-dependent side effect is myopathy, which has a reported incidence of 0.1-0.5%. In combination with fibrates, the incidence increases, and cases of rhabdomyolysis, some fatal, have been described. To minimize the side effects of statin treatment, therefore, target levels--which must be derived on the basis of the results of large studies--must be established for the individual patient.", 
    "40": "In the prevention of coronary heart disease the aim to achieve the target cholesterol and triglyceride levels and the maximal risk reduction leads to the combination of lipid lowering agents. The importance of the combination is supported by the fact that in monotherapy use of the high dose of the drugs, the lipid lowering effect is modest and the side effects are more frequent. The combined therapy is expected to be used more frequently despite the fact, that the improperly applied combination could have serious unfavourable effects. The authors review the advantages and drawbacks of the fibrate-statin combination, which could be used in the most frequent lipid abnormality, the high cholesterol and high triglyceride level, when the combination of micronized fenofibrate and fluvastatin is recommended. Beside the co-administration of other lipid lowering drugs (nicotine acid and resins), it is discussed the combination of statins and fibrates with a new, cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, a well tolerated drug with advantageous safety profile. Considering further metabolic risks the combination of lipid lowering drugs with glitazones, hormone replacement therapy, homocysteine reducing agents is as well highlighted.", 
    "41": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, which are approved for cholesterol reduction, may also be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Atorvastatin (Lipitor) was tested in chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a CD4(+) Th1-mediated central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease model of multiple sclerosis. Here we show that oral atorvastatin prevented or reversed chronic and relapsing paralysis. Atorvastatin induced STAT6 phosphorylation and secretion of Th2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-10) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. Conversely, STAT4 phosphorylation was inhibited and secretion of Th1 cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha) was suppressed. Atorvastatin promoted differentiation of Th0 cells into Th2 cells. In adoptive transfer, these Th2 cells protected recipient mice from EAE induction. Atorvastatin reduced CNS infiltration and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression. Treatment of microglia inhibited IFN-gamma-inducible transcription at multiple MHC class II transactivator (CIITA) promoters and suppressed class II upregulation. Atorvastatin suppressed IFN-gamma-inducible expression of CD40, CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules. l-Mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed atorvastatin's effects on antigen-presenting cells (APC) and T cells. Atorvastatin treatment of either APC or T cells suppressed antigen-specific T-cell activation. Thus, atorvastatin has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects involving both APC and T-cell compartments. Statins may be beneficial for multiple sclerosis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases.", 
    "42": "The pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease is complex and involves several different biochemical pathways. These include defective beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein metabolism, abnormalities of glutamatergic, adrenergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, and the potential involvement of inflammatory, oxidative and hormonal pathways. Consequently, these pathways are all potential targets for Alzheimer's disease treatment and prevention strategies. Currently, the mainstay treatments for Alzheimer's disease are the cholinesterase inhibitors, which increase the availability of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses. Since the cholinesterase inhibitors confer only modest benefits, additional non-cholinergic Alzheimer's disease therapies are urgently needed. Several non-cholinergic agents are currently under development for the treatment and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. These include anti-amyloid strategies (e.g. immunisation, aggregation inhibitors, secretase inhibitors), transition metal chelators (e.g. clioquinol), growth factors, hormones (e.g. estradiol), herbs (e.g. Ginkgo biloba), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g. indomethacin), antioxidants, lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensives, selective phosphodiesterase inhibitors, vitamins (E, B12, B6, folic acid) and agents that target neurotransmitter or neuropeptide alterations. Neurotransmitter receptor-based approaches include agents that modulate certain receptors (e.g. nicotinic, muscarinic, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid [AMPA], gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA], N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA]) and agents that increase the availability of neurotransmitters (e.g. noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors). Of these strategies, the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine is in the most advanced stage of development in the US and is already approved in Europe as the first treatment for moderately severe to severe Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is proposed to counteract cellular damage due to pathological activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate. Results with Ginkgo biloba have been mixed. Data for neurotrophic therapies and vitamin E (tocopherol) appear promising but require confirmation. NSAIDs and conjugated estrogens have not proven to be of value to date for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Statins may have a potential role in reducing the risk or delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease, although this has yet to be confirmed in randomised trials. There are currently no data to support the use of statins as a treatment for dementia. This article provides an update on the current status of selected agents, focusing primarily on those agents with the most extensive clinical evidence at present.", 
    "43": "During the reproductive period, women generally have lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than age- and diet-matched men. However, these possibly antiatherogenic characteristics of lipoproteins are changed to a potentially atherogenic profile after menopause. Menopause-related changes in lipoprotein profile can be corrected by the administration of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, the results of recent studies did not show definite benefits of HRT on coronary heart disease-related mortality rates. On the other hand, several large-scale, long-term clinical trials provide evidence for efficacy and safety of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in both men and women. The results of 19 short-term clinical trials using simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin or lovastatin in postmenopausal women are summarised and discussed. All these investigations reported significant reductions in both total and LDL cholesterol levels. The question of whether statin therapy results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular-related mortality rates along with a better quality of life in postmenopausal women remains to be investigated in large-scale, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.", 
    "44": "As statins may contribute to plaque stabilisation, it is important to evaluate whether these drugs may modify arterial stiffness. In 23 patients, aged 32-70 years, with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, a double-blind randomised study vs placebo was performed to evaluate whether atorvastatin was able to modify aortic stiffness, measured from aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), after a 12-week treatment. The results revealed that atorvastatin did not change blood pressure, significantly lowered (P<0.003; <0.002) plasma total and LDL cholesterol, and increased aortic PWV by +8% (vs -2% under placebo) (P<or=0.05). The percentage changes in plasma total and LDL cholesterol and in PWV were significantly and negatively correlated, independent of blood pressure level. The finding of increased aortic PWV after 12-week statin treatment agrees with studies in monkeys, indicating that, at the early phase of hypolipidaemic diet but not later, aortic PWV increases transiently as a consequence of the significant reduction of lipid vascular content. In conclusion, the present results support the possibility that statins might contribute to a change in arterial stiffness independent of blood pressure level, and suggest that long-term studies in humans are needed to evaluate the contribution of arterial elasticity to statin-induced vascular remodelling.", 
    "45": "The objective of the study was to examine medically managed secondary prevention at one year after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). In all, 214 consecutive patients undergoing isolated elective CABG seen four weeks preoperatively and one year post-operatively. Preoperative systolic blood pressure averaged 135+/-20 mmHg, which increased to 148+/-25 mmHg (P<0.0001) as did diastolic pressure (81+/-12 to 87+/-13 mmHg; P<0.0001). Anginal symptoms were reported by 45.1% (P<0.0001) although median severity scored lower (4.0 [3.0-5.4] vs 0 [0-2.0]; P<0.0001). Breathlessness decreased from 93% to 64% (P<0.0001) and was scored less severely (4.0 [2.0-5.0] vs 2.0 [0-4.0]; P<0.0001. In all, 88% with postoperative angina reported dyspnoea against 44% of those without (P<0.0001). Calcium antagonist use was more common in patients with angina (27.2% vs 5.1%; P<0.0001), but not nitrates (P=0.8695), diuretics (P=0.4218), digoxin (P=0.2565), beta-blockers (P=0.0820), or ACE inhibitors (P=0.7256). Preoperatively 166 patients (80.2%) took aspirin vs 69.2% afterwards (P=0.0131). Twelve patients (6.5%) received warfarin after operation vs none preoperatively. Two took digoxin (0.97%) preoperatively and 14 (7.7%) postoperatively (P=0.001) for chronic atrial fibrillation. One of these took warfarin. Long-acting nitrate use fell from 63.4% to 15.8% (P <0.0001). Short-acting nitrate use fell similarly (P<0.0001). Preoperatively 37 patients (17.9%) took ACE inhibitors vs 44 postoperatively (24.2%); 39 had not received them before. Preoperatively 48 (23.2%) took diuretics vs 30 (16.5%) postoperatively (P=0.127); 24 had not previously taken diuretics. More patients took HMGCoA inhibitors postoperatively (P=0.0068) and total cholesterol was significantly reduced with a concomitant increase in HDL fraction. Smoking habit was virtually unchanged from 17.8% to 15.1% (P=0.5023).",

    "47": "To evaluate the antihyperlipidemic activities of Orengedokuto (OT) and Daio-Orengedokuto (DOT), the inhibitory effects of these polyprescriptions on HMG-CoA reductase and pancreatic lipase and on the rat hyperlipidemic model induced by Triton WR-1339 were measured. OT potently inhibited HMG-CoA reductase but did not inhibit lipase. Among their ingredients, Coptidis Rhizoma was the most potent inhibitor, followed by Rhei Rhizoma. The HMG-CoA reductase-inhibitory activity of 80% EtOH extract was superior to that of water extract. However, DOT potently inhibited HMG CoA-reductase as well as pancreatic lipase. In the rat hyperlipidemic model induced by Triton WR-1339, OT and DOT decreased serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. DOT also decreased serum triglyceride levels, but OT did not decrease it. These results suggest that the antihyperlipidemic activity of DOT may originate from the inhibition of pancreatic lipase as well as HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "48": "Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are currently considered to be a major risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). Deficiencies in the HDL metabolic pathway promote atherosclerosis and contribute to CAD. Low HDL-C levels are included in the Framingham 10-year risk assessment for CAD although they are not yet targeted for therapy. Recent clinical trials have shown benefits from raising HDL-C, particularly in patients with lower baseline levels. The statin class of drugs, used primarily to lower the level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, may be able to raise the HDL-C level as well. Statins could potentially affect HDL-C by different modes of action, most importantly by altering reverse cholesterol transport. Among the currently available statins, simvastatin has demonstrated the most consistent ability to raise HDL-C level, but further large-scale studies at an early stage will be needed to prove the antiatherogenic effects of this class of drugs.", 
    "49": "Type 2 diabetes is associated with a marked increase in coronary artery disease (CAD). In subjects with type 2 diabetes, the characteristic lipoprotein abnormality is increased triglycerides, increased small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, and decreased concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol but relatively normal absolute concentrations of LDL cholesterol. In observational studies, both increased LDL and decreased HDL cholesterol predict the development of CAD. In clinical trials, both fibric acids and statins have been shown to reduce CAD in subjects with diabetes. An interesting future clinical trial would be to assess whether fibric acids make an additional contribution to reduce CAD in patients already on statin therapy.", 
    "50": "The evidence is now clear that plasma apolipoprotein (apo) B is a better index of the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) than total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Moreover, the evidence is also clear that clinical risk of apo B is determined not only by LDL particle number but also by whether small, dense LDL particles are present. The objective of this article, therefore, is to demonstrate how, when, and why apo B should be used in clinical practice. First, the evidence that apo B is superior to LDL cholesterol as an index of the risk of CAD and as a guide to the adequacy of statin therapy is briefly reviewed. Next, the biological bases for this superiority in identifying risk are outlined. Clinical scenarios are then outlined demonstrating the value of measuring apo B in hypertriglyceridemic, hypercholesterolemic, and normolipidemic subjects. The methodological soundness of the laboratory determinations of lipids and apo B is also an important issue. Concern has been raised regarding the measurement of apo B, but it is standardized, precise, and not expensive. Paradoxically, it is becoming ever more obvious that the methodological problems lie with calculated LDL cholesterol. To the known deficiencies must be added the fact that calculated LDL cholesterol systematically underestimates true LDL cholesterol at values close to target levels.Thus, from every perspective-pathophysiology, diagnosis, assessment of therapy, and methodologic soundness-there are powerful clinical arguments why apo B should be used in the routine diagnosis of dyslipidemias and assessment of the adequacy of statin therapy.", 
    "51": "Acute coronary syndromes, stroke, and sudden death are common complications of a disrupted atherosclerotic plaque. Unstable plaque is a result of multiple factors but is commonly characterized by an infiltrate of inflammatory cells. Medical research strongly supports a role for inflammation in the pathogenesis, progression, and disruption of atherosclerotic plaque. Medical science also has improved our understanding of the complex interactions between our environment and our immune, coagulation, and cardiovascular systems. Clinical studies have demonstrated systemic markers of inflammation to be strong predictors of clinical events, and specific treatments of atherosclerosis and its risk factors have been associated with reductions in inflammatory markers. The authors review the current understanding of the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the common inflammatory markers, and potential anti-inflammatory therapy. Among several potential circulating markers of vascular inflammation, high sensitivity C-reactive protein is best validated and standardized as a marker for cardiovascular risk assessment. Nevertheless, there remain many uncertainties in utilizing C-reactive protein in clinical practice. Here, the authors describe the central role of C-reactive protein in atherosclerosis, review the studies demonstrating predictive value of C-reactive protein, describe the factors requiring consideration when utilizing C-reactive protein, discuss clinical scenarios in which measurement of C-reactive protein may be helpful, and suggest ways to interpret and treat elevated C-reactive protein levels. Finally, the authors summarize future expectations for assessing and modulating the vascular inflammation to inhibit initiation and progression of the atherosclerotic process.",

With the release of the third iteration of the National Cholesterol Education Programs Adult Treatment Panel guidelines, there is renewed debate about the appropriate use of pharmacologic therapies in individual patients, especially in primary prevention. Markers of low-grade inflammation may capture the inflammatory aspect of atherosclerosis and may prove to be useful clinical predictors of excess coronary risk. C-reactive protein, an acute-phase reactant protein, appears to be one such promising measurement and may have important implications for the optimal targeting of statin therapy.",

Intima media thickness (IMT) of carotid artery segments and hs-CRP levels were determined at baseline, 1 and 2 years.", 
    "55": "Baseline median hs-CRP values were 2.1 mg/l (interquartile range (IQR) 0.9-5.2) and 2.0 mg/l (IQR 0.8-3.0) and after 2 years these levels decreased to 1.1 mg/l (IQR 0.6-2.4) and 1.5 mg/l (IQR 0.6-3.0) in the atorvastatin 80 mg and simvastatin 40 mg group, respectively. These changes were significant within as well as between the two groups. No correlations were observed between change in hs-CRP after 2 years and change in lipids. A significant correlation was found in univariate analysis between the decrease of hs-CRP and the reduction of IMT.", 
    "56": "Our results show that atorvastatin 80 mg reduces hs-CRP levels to a greater extent than simvastatin 40 mg. Furthermore, we show that the extent of hs-CRP reduction is associated with the progression rate of the atherosclerotic process as measured by IMT.",

The level of expression of three small HSPs, alphaB-crystallin, HSP20, HSP27, as well as the phosphorylation levels of HSP27 and p38, were higher in cultured, asynchronously growing SMCs originating from left interior mammary artery (LIMA) than those originating from aorta, saphenous vein, and umbilical vein, validating the choice of SMCs from LIMA as a model system in our study. In synchronized, quiescent SMCs from LIMA, oxidative stress (H(2)O(2) stimulation)-induced membrane translocation of Rac(1), p38 phosphorylation, membrane translocation, and phosphorylation of HSP27. In these cells, simvastatin (S), an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, blocked, in a mevalonate-dependent way, oxidative stress-induced membrane translocation of Rac(1). However, S pretreatment prior to oxidative stress increased the levels of p38 phosphorylation, HSP27 membrane translocation/phosphorylation, actin polymerization, and apoptosis in these cells, in a mevalonate-dependent way. These results establish that S pretreatment has a stimulatory effect on the stress-activated p38/HSP27 pathway, despite its blocking effect on Rac(1) activation.",

Simvastatin gels caused soft tissue inflammation, which appeared to be related to bone increases. If INJ-SIM animals showing leakage of gel and/or no inflammation were excluded from analysis, INJ-SIM resulted in more bone (58% to 83%) than gel controls.

    "62": "Platelet activation, impairment of fibrinolysis, activation of the coagulation pathway, and dyslipidemia are important factors in the pathogenesis and progression of ischemic heart disease, and patients generally need to use an antiplatelet agent. Lipid-lowering cerivastatin, a novel 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, was administered to 20 patients with primary mixed hyperlipidemia for the assessment of the effect of cerivastatin on lipid levels, plasma fibrinogen concentration, factor VII, VIII, and X levels, plasminogen and antiplasmin concentrations, platelet count, and aggregation (adenosine diphosphate [ADP], collagen, and epinephrine induced). Assessments were made immediately after 2 months of a standard lipid-lowering diet, 4 weeks of placebo administration, and 4 weeks of cerivastatin treatment. Cerivastatin achieved significant reductions in triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The significant improvement of the lipid profile was associated with platelet aggregation reduction in vitro stimulated by ADP, collagen, and epinephrine (P < .05, P = .05, P < .005, respectively). Significantly lower levels of factor VII and fibrinogen were observed (P = .001, P < .0001) immediately after cerivastatin treatment. No significant differences were detected in factor VIII level, plasminogen and antiplasmin concentrations, and platelet count after cerivastatin treatment. It was concluded that cerivastatin in mixed hyperlipidemia can exert beneficial changes on specific hemostatic variables and platelet aggregation in addition to its positive effects on plasma lipid values.",

    "64": "The effect of atorvastatin, at 10 mg or 40 mg for 6 wk, on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism during the postprandial phase in subjects (n = 11) displaying type IIB hyperlipidemia was evaluated. The postprandial increment in area under the curve above baseline concentrations in type IIB subjects was significantly decreased by atorvastatin for plasma triglyceride (A10: -42% and A40: -55%, P < 0.01), chylomicrons (CMs) (A10: -24% and A40: -40%, P < 0.03) and VLDL-1 (A10: -54% and A40: -52%, P < 0.02). Before atorvastatin therapy, postprandial cholesteryl ester (CE) transfer from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to CMs (2.5-fold; P < 0.005), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-1 (1.8-fold; P < 0.005), VLDL-2 (1.4-fold; P < 0.05), and intermediate-density lipoproteins (1.4-fold; P < 0.05) were significantly increased 4 h postprandially. Following statin treatment, the postprandial transfer of CE from HDL to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) at the 4-h time point was significantly reduced at 10 mg/d (-26%; P < 0.05) and at 40 mg/d (-24%; P < 0.05), compared with that before treatment. Such postprandial increase in CE transferred from HDLs to TRLs arose exclusively from accelerated CE transfer from HDLs to CMs (2.5-fold; P < 0.005). In conclusion, atorvastatin attenuates the abnormal intravascular remodeling of postprandial TRL particles via marked reduction in CE transfer in type IIB hyperlipidemia and diminishes the postprandial formation and accumulation of CMs and VLDL-1.", 
    "65": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the major inhibitor of endogenous thrombolysis, thereby promoting thrombosis. PAI-1 is also a primary contributor to the development and recurrence of acute myocardial infarction. The renin angiotensin system, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, and estrogen all influence the fibrinolytic system and PAI-1 in particular. Available data strongly suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and hormone replacement therapy with estrogen beneficially reduce PAI-1 production. Metformin, an agent commonly used for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), appears to favorably decrease PAI-1 production in NIDDM patients but not nondiabetic patients. Among the cholesterol-lowering statins, clinical literature evaluating pravastatin provides the most compelling data to support this agent's favorable effect on PAI-1. Other available statins either have not displayed an effect on PAI-1 or do not have clear data to conclusively define their effects on the fibrinolytic system.", 
    "66": "Recently, several articles have been published dealing with the anabolic effects on bone by statins. Mundy and associates discovered that several statins were able to activate the promotor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2. Additionally, oral simvastatin and lovastatin increased the cancellous bone volume in rats, presumably an effect of the increase of BMP-2. Other studies have followed, with conflicting results; some have found a positive bone metabolic effect of statins and others have not. Studies published so far have focused on osteoporosis. In this study, femur fractures were produced in 81 mature male BALB/c mice and stabilized with marrow-nailing. Forty-one mice were given a diet prepared with simvastatin, so that each mouse received an approximate dose of 120 mg/kg of body weight per day. The remaining mice received the same diet with the exception of the simvastatin. Bilateral femurs were harvested at 8, 14, and 21 days postoperatively (po), the marrow-nail was extracted, and diameters were measured. Biomechanical tests were performed on 42 mice, by way of three-point bending. Histological specimens were prepared using standard techniques. For statistical analysis, ANOVA with Scheff\u00e9s post hoc test was used. At 8 days, the fracture callus was too soft for meaningful biomechanical testing. At 14 days, the callus of the simvastatin-treated mice had a 53% larger transverse area than controls (p = 0.001), the force required to break the bone was 63% greater (p = 0.001), and the energy uptake was increased by 150% (p = 0.0008). Stiffness and modulus of elasticity were not significantly affected. At 21 days, the fractures were histologically healed and the mechanical differences had disappeared. The contralateral unbroken bone showed a slight increase in transverse area because of the simvastatin treatment, but there was no significant effect on the force required to break the bone or on energy uptake. These results point to a new possibility in the treatment of fractures.", 
    "67": "Cholesterol is an important molecule that plays a key role in regulating cellular differentiation and function. Although the possible role of lipids has been implicated in regulating osteoblastic cells, the role of cholesterol in that process is not well defined. In this study we have examined the role of the cellular cholesterol biosynthetic pathway on osteoblastic differentiation of marrow stromal cells (MSCs). Treatment of pluripotent mouse MSCs M2-10B4 with inhibitors of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway mevastatin or mevinolin inhibited the maturation of these cells into functional osteoblastic cells. This was determined by the inhibition of the activity and expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a key enzyme involved in differentiation and mineralization of osteoblastic cell cultures, as well as inhibition of mineralization. Mevastatin treatment did not affect expression of the osteoblast-specific gene osteocalcin (OCN). Furthermore, promoter-reporter studies in MSCs showed that mevastatin inhibited activity of the ALP gene promoter, suggesting regulation by derivatives of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The effects of mevastatin and mevinolin were reversed by mevalonate but not by geranylgeraniol or farnesol, intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Altogether, these results suggest that products of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway are important for proper development of MSCs into functional osteoblastic cells capable of forming a mineralized matrix. Identification of those molecules may provide new therapeutic approaches to prevent the decline in osteoblastic activity in osteoporosis and aging.",

Dyslipidemia is also commonly associated with hypertension, hyperinsulinemia and central obesity in the metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle adjustments including increased physical activity and dietary modifications leading to weight reduction are important first steps in the prevention of coronary heart disease in patients with such abnormalities in lipid metabolism. When these adjustments are insufficient to achieve desirable results, the combined treatment with statins and omega-3 fatty acids is an efficient treatment alternative. Both statins and omega-3 fatty acids have documented their effects against coronary heart disease (CHD) both in primary and secondary prevention trials. The mechanisms involved are only partly explained, however, the synergistic effects of statins and omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduce the risk for CHD in patients with dyslipidemia.", 
    "74": "Colchicine and 3-hydroxy-3-methy-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are well known to cause myopathy. Myotoxicity is dose-dependent in both drugs; therefore, the onset of symptoms usually takes months or years. We report the case of a patient with chronic renal failure who had been taking simvastatin for 2 years and developed acute weakness 2 weeks after the start of treatment with colchicines for recurrent gout. The electromyography and elevated muscle enzymes indicated that his symptoms were caused by myopathy. When this patient stopped taking both drugs, his weakness resolved rapidly. Acute myopathy induced by combination therapy with colchicines and simvastatin is rare. In patients with chronic renal failure, co-administration of colchicine with simvastatin may accelerate the onset of myopathy because CYP3A4 (part of cytochrome P450) is crucial in the breakdown of both drugs. When adding colchicine to a medication regimen that includes a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for patients with renal insufficiency, drugs that are metabolized outside the CYP3A4 system (e.g., fluvastatin and pravastatin) should be selected instead.", 
    "75": "The purpose of Holicos-PAT was to investigate the efficacy of serum lipid lowering by pravastatin against coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in the Japanese population. Hypercholesterolemic men and women (n = 2,232), aged 40-70 years, were followed up for 5 years, while they were receiving pravastatin (group P, n = 1,422) or only diet therapy (group C, n = 810). The primary endpoint was CHD (a composite of onset or worsening of angina pectoris, performing CABG or PTCA, non-fatal myocardial infarction, death from CHD including heart death or sudden death). The secondary endpoints were comprised of CVD, total mortality, variation of serum lipid and apoprotein levels, and a relationship between the LDL-C level and occurrence of CHD. For several reasons (proving to meet the exclusion criteria after registration, etc.), 1,290 cases of group P and 749 cases of group C were used as subjects for the primary analysis. The mean follow-up period was 4.5 years in group P and 4.2 years in group C for events of CHD. The mean LDL-C level (SD) in group P was 176 (29) mg/dl and decreased to 134 (29) mg/dl one year later. This effect continued during the follow-up period.CHD events occurred in 9.2/1000 patient-years for men and 2.4/1000 patient-years for women without a history of CHD.CHD events occurred in 55.3/1000 patient-years for men and 23.6/1000 patient-years for women with a history of CHD, which was 6 times higher in men and 10 times higher in women than in those without a history of CHD, respectively. The adjusted relative risk ratio of group P to group C for CHD events was 0.74 (95%CI: 0.47-1.19). In the patients with a history of CHD, the ratio was 0.55 (95%CI: 0.30-1.00). The effect was apparent in the patients with a history of CHD. The incidence of myocardial infarction in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia living in the Hokuriku district was apparently lower, than the worldwide incidence, indicative that pravastatin may have a tendency to inhibit the occurrence of events of arteriosclerotic disease.", 
    "76": "We investigated the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on the activity and concentration of plasma cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) in 30 hypercholesterolemic patients. Patients were divided into three groups according to TaqIB polymorphism of the CETP gene. The activity (158 +/- 23% control, mean +/- SEM) and concentration (4.1 +/- 1.0 mg/l) of plasma CETP were significantly (p < 0.005) higher in the subjects with the B1B1 genotype than B2B2 genotype (106 +/- 25% and 2.5 +/- 1.1 mg/l, respectively). Plasma CETP activity and concentration levels in the B1B2 group were intermediate between those of the B1B1 and B2B2 groups, and significantly (p < 0.05) low compared with the B1B1 group.Both the activity and concentration of plasma CETP were positively correlated with the LDL-cholesterol concentration (r = 0.608, p < 0.0005 and r = 0.552, p < 0.005, respectively). The administration of statins significantly reduced not only the activity (p < 0.01) but also the concentration (p < 0.05) of plasma CETP in hypercholesterolemic patients. Taken together, we confirmed that statins would be effective in increasing HDL levels in Japanese B1B1 carriers, because of a lower concentration of HDL cholesterol and higher level of plasma CETP compared to the other genotypes. The genetic variation in the CETP gene may be one important factor in designing better treatments.",

In order to see whether inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase is of benefit, two of our patients have been treated with simvastatin in addition to the long-term treatment with cholesterol and bile acids. Absolute as well as relative levels of DHC were reduced. In one patient, creatine kinase increased moderately after 2 months of treatment. In the other patient, the treatment had to be interrupted because of hepatotoxic side effects with a marked increase in alanine aminotransferase and aggravation of the hypocholesterolemia and photosensitivity. We conclude that even if the levels of accumulated intermediates can be reduced, treatment with a statin may be harmful in some patients with SLOS.", 
    "82": "Hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease is characterized by abnormal proliferation of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, leading to occlusion of pulmonary arterioles, pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, and death. Compounds with antiproliferative effects on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, may prevent the development of experimental hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease. Pneumonectomized rats injected with monocrotaline at 7 days develop severe hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease with neointimal formation. Rats were randomized to receive either vehicle or treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (2 mg/kg per day). By Day 35, rats that received vehicle had higher mean pulmonary arterial pressures (53 +/- 2 mm Hg) and right ventricular hypertrophy (right ventricle/[left ventricle plus septum] [RV/LV+S] = 0.78 +/- 0.09) than rats in Group PMS5-35 that received simvastatin from Day 5 to 35 (mean pulmonary arterial pressure = 27 +/- 3 mm Hg, RV/LV+S = 0.34 +/- 0.08; p < or = 0.001). Pulmonary vascular remodeling with neointimal formation consisting of vascular smooth muscle cells was more severe in vehicle-treated rats (vascular occlusion score, 1.98 +/- 0.02) than in Group PMS5-35 (vascular occlusion score, 0.59 +/- 0.46; p < 0.001). In addition, lung endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene expression was decreased in vehicle-treated animals but was restored toward normal levels in simvastatin-treated animals. Simvastatin attenuates monocrotaline-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling with neointimal formation, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and right ventricular hypertrophy in rats.", 
    "83": "Coronary stenoses of intermediate severity create difficulties in decision making when revascularization is concerned. Myocardial fractional flow reserve (mFFR), an accurate tool to identify physiological significance of individual coronary stenoses, may help solve this problem.", 
    "84": "Fifty-eight intermediate (30-70%) coronary stenoses in 51 patients (mean age 54.4 +/- 8.9 years, 9 women) were left unrevascularized because of normal (> or = 0.75) mFFR findings and the patients were prospectively followed with regard to the occurrence of death, myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization. The mean reference vessel diameter, percent stenosis and mFFR of the intermediate lesions were 3.3 +/- 0.3 mm, 46.8 +/- 9.2% and 0.86 +/- 0.05, respectively. Of the 58 intermediate lesions, 20 (34%) were associated with perfusion defects on thallium scan. Significant (> 70%) disease in addition to the one with the intermediate stenosis was present in I coronary artery in 24 (47%), and 2 coronary arteries in 6 (12%) patients and angioplasty of at least one significant stenosis was performed at the initial evaluation in 18 (35%) patients. Follow-up for a mean of 16.6 +/- 6.6 months disclosed no death or myocardial infarction. Target vessel revascularization was performed in 3 (6%) patients at a mean of 4 +/- 2.6 months. A control angiogram, which was performed in 12 of 18 patients who had undergone angioplasty at the initial evaluation revealed restenosis in 3 (25%) patients with no significant angiographic changes in the target intermediate stenoses. Anginal status was found to be significantly improved at follow-up.", 
    "85": "In this study, we found that intermediate coronary stenoses with an mFFR > or = 0.75 have a favourable medium-term clinical outcome with respect to major cardiac adverse events when left unrevascularized based on mFFR findings.", 
    "86": "Lovastatin is a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the key regulatory enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of mevalonate, which is also the precursor of isoprenoid moieties, such as farnesol and geraniol, that are incorporated into several molecules essential for tumor cell signaling. Here, we describe that pretreatment with a non-cytotoxic concentration of lovastatin (10 microM) dramatically inhibited the metastatic ability of F311 mammary carcinoma cells in syngeneic BALB/c mice. Similarly, daily i.p. treatment of animals with a well-tolerated dose of lovastatin (10 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the number of experimental lung metastases. In vitro, incubation of F3II monolayers in the presence of lovastatin caused a rounded-cell morphology. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a lack of cortical actin organization, micrutubule disruption and inhibition of integrin-mediated focal contacts in lovastatin-treated cells. Exposure of F3II cells to lovastatin significantly inhibited tumor cell adhesion and migration, and coincubation with the cholesterol precursor mevalonate prevented these effects. Lovastatin reduced membrane localization of Rho protein, a signaling molecule involved in the regulation of actin-based cell motility that needs geranylation for membrane association and activation. In addition, lovastatin induced a dose-dependent inhibition in the secretion of urokinase, a key proteolytic enzyme during tumor invasion and metastasis, and a significant increase of tissue-type plasminogen activator, a marker of good prognosis in mammary cancer. These data suggest that antimetastatic properties of lovastatin are strongly associated with alterations in cytoskeleton organization and the consequent modulation of adhesion, motility and proteolysis.", 
    "87": "The introduction of statins has been a breakthrough in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Statins are safe and effective in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease in the general population. The 'Heart protection study' has provided evidence for the benefit of statin treatment in much broader populations than is presently indicated in the Dutch national guidelines, i.e. also in high-risk persons with diabetes mellitus, and irrespective of age or cholesterol level. The use and cost of statins, which have been referred to as 'lifestyle-drugs' in the lay press, have risen enormously. Recently, the Dutch College of Healthcare Insurers issued a report in which recommendations concerning the reimbursement of the costs for cholesterol-lowering drugs are based on 'generally accepted insights into the appropriate use of these drugs'. Lifestyle and/or age are not exclusion criteria for treatment with statins. The expiration of patents of some statins and modifications to the reimbursement system in 2003 could lead to cost reductions.", 
    "88": "Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) seems to have a favorable influence on the plasma lipid profile. Only a few investigations have examined the effects of HRT versus hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. We compared the relative effects of different hypolipidemic strategies on lipoproteins and coagulative parameters in women with recent-onset spontaneous menopause. In this 24-week, placebo-controlled trial, 60 consecutive healthy women aged >/= 45 years, with amenorrhea from 6 to 60 months (mean, 1.9 +/- 1.4 years), serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than 40 U/L, and slight to moderate hypercholesterolemia (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [LDL-C] 160 to 250 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL-C] < 75 mg/dL, and triglycerides < 200 mg/dL) were enrolled and randomized to dietetic advice (placebo group), simvastatin 10 mg, 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), or 50 microg estrogen transdermal patch (ETP). In the latter 2 cases, the progestative nomegestrol was added to estrogens (days 17 to 28 of the cicle). Lipoprotein parameters were evaluated after separating very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) by ultracentrifugation, while fasting glucose and insulin, homocysteine, and hemocoagulative parameters were determined in plasma. Fifty-four patients completed the trial. Total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C significantly decrased in the simvastatin (-62 mg/dL [-20%] and -72 mg/dL [-30%], respectively), CEE (-42 mg/dL [-13%] and -45 mg/dL [-18%]), and ETP (-30 mg/dL [-10%] and -26 mg/dL [-11%]) groups compared to baseline, but only simvastatin showed an effect significantly superior to diet alone. Apolipoprotein (Apo) B was decreased by simvastatin (-25%, P <.001) and by CEE (-10%, P <.05); again, simvastatin was more effective than either diet or ETP. Triglyceride concentration and VLDL-C were unmodified by treatments. HDL-C and Apo A-I significantly increased in the simvastatin group (+18% and +8%, respectively), while HDL-C was unmodified by both HRT regimens and Apo A-I was reduced by ETP treatment (-17%); lipoprotein[a] (Lp[a]) was decreased by both HRTs (-38%, P <.05, and -22%, P =.07, for CEE and ETP, respectively). Among coagulative parameters, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was significantly reduced by CEE (-29%, P <.05) but not ETP treatment (+16%, P = not significant), while fibrinogen, antithrombin, and homocysteine were unaffected by therapy. Thus, HRT, particularly CEE, seems well tolerated and moderately effective in improving the lipid pattern and, perhaps, the coagulative/fibrinolytic balance in postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women; it may represent a therapeutic option in slightly dyslipidemic subjects. Statins are preferred in case of more severe disease.", 
    "89": "We report the incidence of new coronary events and new atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI) in older men and women with diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, and a serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of >/=125 mg/dl treated with statins and with no lipid-lowering drug.", 
    "90": "The incidence of new coronary events and of new ABI was investigated in an observational prospective study of 529 diabetics, mean age 79 +/- 9 years, with prior myocardial infarction and a serum LDL cholesterol of >/=125 mg/dl treated with statins (279 persons or 53%) and no lipid-lowering drug (250 persons or 47%). Follow-up was 29 +/- 18 months.", 
    "91": "At follow-up, the stepwise Cox regression model showed that after controlling for other risk factors, the use of statins was associated with a 37% significant independent reduction in the incidence of new coronary events and with a 47% significant independent reduction in the incidence of new ABI.", 
    "92": "Use of statins was associated with a 37% significant, independent reduction in new coronary events and a 47% significant, independent reduction in new ABI in older men and women with diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, and a serum LDL cholesterol of >/=125 mg/dl. Elderly diabetics with prior myocardial infarction and increased serum LDL cholesterol should especially be treated with statins.", 
    "93": "It has been reported that inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. One inhibitor which induces apoptosis is mevastatin. However, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction is not well understood so the effects of mevastatin on various functions of HL-60 cells were investigated. We confirmed that mevastatin activated caspase-3 by release of cytochrome c (Cyt. c) from mitochondria through a membrane permeability transition mechanism and also induced typical fragmentation and ladder formation of DNA in HL-60 cells. These effects were inhibited by mevalonate, a metabolic intermediate of cholesterol biosynthesis. Mevalonate and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) inhibited DNA fragmentation whereas farnesol (FOH) did not. Mevastatin also induced cell differentiation to monocytic cells via a mevalonate inhibitable mechanism. Furthermore, mevastatin decreased the amount of an isoprenylated membrane bound Rap1 small GTPase concomitant with an increase in cytosolic Rap1 which occurred before apoptosis and differentiation. On the contrary, both mevastatin and geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), which competes with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, induced membrane depolarization of isolated mitochondria without swelling and Cyt. c release. These results suggest that mevastatin-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells might be caused indirectly by activation of the caspase cascade through the modulation of mitochondrial functions and that some relationship between a certain small GTPase molecule, such as Rap1, and mevastatin-induced apoptosis may exist.", 
    "94": "Cardiovascular diseases secondary to accelerated atherosclerosis are now accepted as a cause of mortality and morbidity in patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. More recently, atherosclerosis is emerging as one of the most serious complications in the anti-phospholipid syndrome, although large epidemiological studies, such as those performed in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis patients, have not been performed up to now. Classical risk factors (dislipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, etc.) and steroid therapy cannot completely explain the high prevalence of cardiovascular complications in systemic autoimmune diseases. Since the modern view defines atherosclerosis as a chronic inflammatory disorder, it has been suggested that systemic inflammation and soluble immune mediators (circulating autoantibodies, immune-complexes, complement activation products) might play a role in accelerating vessel pathology. The main target appears to be the endothelium because of its ability to switch to a pro-adhesive, pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant surface in response to these mediators. Recent advances in the knowledge of the pharmacology of statins have indicated that these drugs rather than to be simple cholesterol lowering molecules display a pleiotropic effects on several mechanisms involved in the atherosclerotic plaque formation. Their anti-inflammatory activity and particularly their ability to downregulate endothelial cell activation induced by different stimuli strongly suggest their possible use in conditions in which the systemic inflammation and the endothelial activation/damage are thought to represent key pathogenic mechanisms.", 
    "95": "Bexarotene (Targretin oral capsules), the first RXR-selective retinoid \"rexinoid\" approved for all stages of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), had a response rate (RR) of 45% at the optimal dose of 300 mg/m(2) per day in 2 multicenter trials. With hypertriglyceridemia reported at 79%, bexarotene is often administered with lipid-lowering agents (LLAs). Statins (inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) may modulate class II major histocompatibility class expression and T-cell responses.",

    "98": "Fifty-four patients receiving bexarotene monotherapy achieved an overall RR of 48%. Thirteen had stage IA-IIA disease (RR = 53%, 1 complete response [CR]); 41 had stage IIB-IVB disease (RR = 46%, 2 CRs). Forty-two (77%) of these also required one or more LLAs: atorvastatin (n = 29, RR 43%), atorvastatin plus fenofibrate (n = 10, RR 90%), or gemfibrozil (n = 3, RR 33%). Gemfibrozil was discontinued because it increased bexarotene and triglyceride levels. Patients taking 2 LLAs had a significantly higher RR of 90% during monotherapy than those taking one or no LLAs (P <.0001). Forty of 54 patients (74%) received thyroid hormone replacement to normalize thyroxine levels. Four patients receiving monotherapy have complete CRs of >3 years' duration and received maintenance dosing. Sixteen patients with advanced disease treated with bexarotene (225-750 mg/d) in combination with other CTCL therapies achieved an overall RR of 69% (11/16) with concomitant statin therapy. Bexarotene was safely combined with psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA) plus interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) (n = 2, RR = 50%), with extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) (n = 8, RR = 75%, 1 CR), with ECP/IFN-alpha (n = 4, RR =50%), with ECP/IFN-alpha/PUVA (n = 1, RR = 100%), and with IFN-alpha/PUVA/topical nitrogen mustard (n = 1, RR = 100%). Two patients receiving IFN-alpha had slight leukopenia, but rhabdomyolysis associated with multiple LLAs did not occur.", 
    "99": "This single-center study supports the safety and efficacy of bexarotene as both a monotherapy and a combination therapy for CTCL. Long durable CRs may be achieved with oral monotherapy. Use of statins with bexarotene may also increase RRs by permitting higher doses to be administered without interruption, by modulating the immune response, or both. When bexarotene is combined with other active CTCL therapies, higher RRs were achieved in patients with advanced disease, without unacceptable side effects.", 
    "100": "In Drosophila, locomotor activity is sexually dimorphic and the brain area controlling this dimorphism has been mapped. The neurons of the pars intercerebralis (PI) have been suggested to participate in such differences between males and females. However, the precise physical nature of the dimorphism, the identity of the PI neurons involved, and the nature of the neuronal signal coding the dimorphism remain unknown. In this study, we used a video-tracking paradigm to characterize further the pattern of locomotor activity in Drosophila. We show that the number of activity/inactivity periods (start/stop bouts) is also sexually dimorphic, and that it can be genetically feminized in males. Moreover, the transplantation of PI neurons from a female, or of feminized PI neurons from a donor male into a receiver wild-type male is sufficient to induce the feminization of locomotor behavior, confirming that this tiny cluster of approximately 10 neurons is directly responsible for the sexual dimorphism in locomotor activity. Finally, feeding males with fluvastatin, a juvenile hormone (JH) inhibitor, also led to start/stop feminization, and this effect is reversible by the simultaneous application of methoprene, a JH analog, suggesting the existence of a neuroendocrine control, by JH, of such behavioral dimorphism.", 
    "101": "This study evaluated the effects of rosiglitazone therapy on lipids and the efficacy and safety of rosiglitazone in combination with atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Three-hundred thirty-two patients entered an 8-week, open-label, run-in treatment phase with rosiglitazone 8 mg/day, and 243 were randomized to a 16-week, double-blinded period of continued rosiglitazone plus placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg/day, or atorvastatin 20 mg/day. With rosiglitazone alone, a modest increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (9%), a shift in LDL phenotype from dense to large buoyant subfractions (52% of patients), and an increase in total high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (6%), predominantly in HDL(2) levels (13%), occurred from week 0 to week 8. When atorvastatin was added, there was a further increase in HDL(3) (5%) and expected significant reductions (p <0.0001) in LDL cholesterol (-39%), apolipoprotein B (-35%), and triglyceride levels (-27%). Glycemic control achieved with rosiglitazone alone was not adversely affected by add-on atorvastatin. The combination was well tolerated compared with placebo. To conclude, in addition to the beneficial effects of rosiglitazone on glycemic control, rosiglitazone and atorvastatin in combination achieved 2 goals: the reduction of LDL cholesterol to <100 mg/dl and the removal of small dense LDL in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "102": "This study examined the effects of simvastatin on C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflammatory markers in study subjects with significant elevations in triglyceride (TG) blood levels. CRP, vascular cellular adhesion molecule (VCAM), serum amyloid A (SAA), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured in archived plasma samples from 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies designed to examine the lipid-altering efficacy of simvastatin in study subjects with elevated TGs. In the first study, 130 study subjects with mixed hyperlipidemia (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol > or =130 mg/dl; TGs 300 to 700 mg/dl) received placebo or simvastatin 40 or 80 mg once daily for three 6-week periods in a complete-block crossover design. In the second study, 195 study subjects with hypertriglyceridemia (TGs 300 to 900 mg/dl) received daily doses of placebo or simvastatin 20, 40, or 80 mg for 6 weeks. Significant but weak correlations were observed between baseline CRP values and baseline levels of LDL cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, but not with TGs. CRP was also correlated with body mass index and fasting levels of glucose and insulin. Treatment with simvastatin 20, 40, and 80 mg led to significant reductions in CRP plasma levels versus placebo (p <0.05). Although CRP change was weakly correlated with changes in LDL cholesterol, TGs, and HDL cholesterol, results of regression analyses showed that only baseline CRP and treatment allocation were significant predictors of CRP response after 6 weeks of study drug administration. Simvastatin had no effect on VCAM, SAA, or IL-6. In summary, simvastatin significantly reduced CRP in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "103": "We investigated the direct effects of cerivastatin on hypertrophy of cultured rat neonatal myocytes induced by endothelin and the mechanism by which cerivastatin exerts its effects. Endothelin significantly increased [14C]phenylalanine ([14C]Phe) incorporation, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release, ANP mRNA expression and cell size. Cerivastatin significantly reduced the increase in [14C]phenylalanine incorporation, ANP peptide release, ANP mRNA expression and cell size induced by endothelin, but pravastatin did not. Exogenous mevalonate completely prevented the inhibitory effect of cerivastatin on [14C]phenylalanine incorporation, ANP release and cell size. Cotreatment with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate also attenuated the effect of cerivastatin on [14C]phenylalanine incorporation, but cotreatment with farnesyl pyrophosphate or squalene did not. Furthermore, both Rho inhibitor C3 exoenzyme and Rho-dependent kinase inhibitor, (R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide.2HCl (Y27632) significantly decreased [14C]phenylalanine incorporation, ANP secretion, ANP mRNA expression and cell size. Cerivastatin decreased endothelin-induced Rho protein expression, and mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate reversed this effect. These results suggest that cerivastatin directly attenuates cardiac hypertrophy induced by endothelin in cultured rat myocytes partly by inhibition of the Rho pathway.",

In the study group, 37 patients received statins for more than 4 weeks and 35 were not receiving statins. We measured the temperature difference (deltaT) between the atherosclerotic plaque and the proximal vessel wall (background temperature) using a thermography catheter. The statistical analysis showed that the mean value of deltaT was higher in the untreated group compared to the treated-with-statin, group (0.56+/-0.41 vs 0.29+/-0.33 degrees C, P<0.01). Moreover, a progressive increase in deltaT by type of clinical syndrome was observed in both groups (statin group; effort angina: 0.24+/-0.15, unstable angina: 0.26+/-0.26, acute myocardial infarction: 0.40+/-0.28, vs untreated group; effort angina: 0.41+/-0.26, unstable angina: 0.44+/-0.28, acute myocardial infarction: 0.84+/-0.52, P<0.05).

Preliminary studies and retrospective analyses of large clinical trials support the hypothesis that statins may be of benefit in ACSs. A recently published randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial evaluated the clinical impact of high-dose atorvastatin in patients with ACSs. Use of atorvastatin resulted in a decrease in a combined endpoint of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, initiation of statin therapy during hospitalization improves long-term compliance and may significantly improve clinical outcome.",

In addition to the immunosuppressive therapy, the patients received a daily dose of 40 mg/day pravastatin for the first 8 days which was then reduced to 10 mg/day administered until Day 29. Blood was sampled for pharmacokinetic profiling (maximum concentration of the drug (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (tmax), area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC(0-24h)), elimination half-life time (tcl)) and measurement of the parameters of clinical chemistry on Days 1, 8 and 29.

We investigated the long-term effects of lovastatin alone and in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid on biliary lipid composition and gallstone dissolution. Forty-two prairie dogs were fed 1.2% cholesterol diet for 5 weeks, and cholecystectomy was performed on 6 animals to confirm gallstones. The remaining animals were maintained on a 0.4% cholesterol diet and were randomized to receive placebo, lovastatin (3.3 mg/g diet), ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg/g), or combination of both drugs. After 10 weeks, animals underwent cholecystectomy. Dissolution response to therapy was determined, and serum and biliary lipids were measured. All treatment groups had significant reductions in serum cholesterol. Lovastatin treatment reduced both hepatic and gallbladder bile cholesterol, altered bile acid composition, and induced a 79% total response compared to placebo. Although ursodeoxycholic treatment induced a 44% response, long-term combination treatment elevated both gallbladder bile cholesterol and calcium and failed to produce an augmented response.

    "120": "Hypercholesterolemia was present in 534 (63%) out of 848 coronary patients and 399 (37%) out of 1078 control participants. One hundred and seventy-one (32%) of the hypercholesterolemic patients and 168 (42%) of the hypercholesterolemic control participants were treated with statins and also followed a Mediterranean diet. The analysis showed that the combination of a Mediterranean diet and statin medical therapy is associated with an additional reduction of the coronary risk (odds ratio = 0.57, P < 0.01), independently from cholesterol levels and the other cardiovascular factors.", 
    "121": "The adoption of a Mediterranean diet by hypercholesterolemic people seems to reinforce the benefits from statin treatment on lipid levels and reduces the risk of developing ACS. However, it is hard to claim that our findings suggest causal evidence, and in order to explain the potential common mechanism between diet and statin treatment much remains to be learned.", 
    "122": "A 36-year-old male patient, after 3 months' treatment with fluvastatin 40 mg/d for hypercholesterolemia, presented with acute pancreatitis. The pancreatitis was mild, and the patient settled on medical treatment. Other causes of the disease were ruled out. Some months later, the patient reintroduced fluvastatin on his own initiative, which caused a recurrence of pancreatitis within a few days. Previous reports are reviewed, showing that statin-induced acute pancreatitis may occur within the first day of therapy or after several months. It is generally mild and runs a benign course, and no mortality has been reported. The frequency of this side effect is unknown, but it is most likely rare.", 
    "123": "To investigate the effect of lovastatin on proliferation and extracellular matrix secretion of hepatic stellate cells in vitro.", 
    "124": "Rat hepatic stellate cells were incubated with different concentration of lovastatin and geranyl geranypyrophosphate. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT colorimetric assay. Cell cycle was analysed by flow cytometry. Type IV collagen and laminin were determined by ELISA, and c-jun and c-fos expression by immunocytochemistry and computer video text analysis system.", 
    "125": "Addition of 0.1 to 50 micromol/L lovastatin into culture medium had no toxicity to hepatic stellate cells, but could significantly inhibit hepatic stellate cell proliferation and provoke G0/G1 phase arrest in dose-dependent manner, and could also markedly inhibit the c-jun and c-fos expression and type IV collagen and laminin secretion, which could partly be antagonized by geranyl geranypyrophosphate.", 
    "126": "Lovastatin can significantly inhibit hepatic stellate cell proliferation and type IV collagen and laminin secretion, which might be partly related to its inhibitory effect on geranyl geranypyrophosphate formation.", 
    "127": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been demonstrated to have in vitro vascular effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether statins actually have in vivo vascular effects independent of their cholesterol-lowering effect.", 
    "128": "We investigated the effect of a single dose of cerivastatin on vascular endothelial function by measuring flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery on ultrasound in 30 healthy volunteers with normal serum cholesterol concentrations. They were randomized to either placebo group (n = 15) or cerivastatin group (n = 15), and flow-mediated dilatation and endothelium-dependent dilatation were evaluated at before and 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h after administration of placebo or cerivastatin.", 
    "129": "There were no differences in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, malondialdehyde-LDL, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein before and after administration of placebo or cerivastatin. Cerivastatin significantly increased flow-mediated dilatation at 3 h (P < 0.001), and this increase rapidly returned to the baseline level 6 h after administration. Endothelium--independent dilatation of brachial artery was not altered.", 
    "130": "A single dose of cerivastatin increased vascular endothelial responsiveness. Our data suggest that cerivastatin has a direct effect on the blood vessels that is independent of its lipid-lowering effect, and thus can be considered as a vascular statin.", 
    "131": "A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate LDL cholesterol-lowering efficacy, overall safety, and tolerability and the influence on growth and pubertal development of simvastatin in a large cohort of boys and girls with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH).", 
    "132": "A total of 173 heFH children (98 boys and 75 girls) were included in this study. After a 4-week diet/placebo run-in period, children with heFH were randomized to either simvastatin or placebo in a ratio of 3:2. Simvastatin was started at 10 mg/d and titrated at 8-week intervals to 20 and then 40 mg/d. During a 24-week extension period, the patients continued to receive simvastatin (40 mg) or placebo according to their assignment. After 48 weeks of simvastatin therapy, there were significant reductions of LDL cholesterol (-41%), total cholesterol (-31%), apolipoprotein B (-34%), VLDL cholesterol (-21%), and triglyceride (-9%) levels. HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels were increased by 3.3% and 10.4%, respectively (not significant). No safety issues became evident. Except for small decreases in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate compared with placebo, there were no significant changes from baseline in adrenal, gonadal, and pituitary hormones in either treatment group.", 
    "133": "Simvastatin significantly reduced LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels and was well tolerated in children with heFH. There was no evidence of any adverse effect of simvastatin on growth and pubertal development. Therefore, simvastatin at doses up to 40 mg is a well-tolerated and effective therapy for heFH children.", 
    "134": "Stenting-related myocardial injury has been recognized as a frequent and prognostically important event, the extent of which depends on microcirculatory impairment in association with platelet aggregation, inflammation, and increased oxidative stress. Recent studies underscored the non-lipid-lowering effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) with antithrombotic, antiinflammatory, and antioxidative aspects. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that preprocedural statin therapy is associated with a reduction in the extent of stenting-related myocardial injury.", 
    "135": "We stratified 296 consecutive patients who were undergoing stenting of a de novo stenosis according to the preprocedural status of statin therapy (229 statin-treated and 67 control patients). Incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury was assessed by analysis of creatine kinase (CK; upper limit of normal [ULN] 70 IU/L for women, 80 IU/L for men) and cardiac troponin T (cTnT; bedside test; threshold 0.1 ng/mL) before and 6, 12, and 24 hours after the intervention. Relative to control patients, the incidence of CK elevation >3x ULN was more than 90% lower in statin-treated patients (0.4% versus 6.0%, P=0.01). Statin therapy was the only factor independently associated with a lower risk of CK elevation >3x ULN (OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.75; P=0.03). The overall incidences of CK and cardiac troponin T elevation were slightly lower in statin-treated than in control patients (14.4% versus 20.9%, P=0.3, and 17.9% versus 22.4%, P=0.5, respectively).", 
    "136": "Preprocedural statin therapy is associated with a reduction in the incidence of larger-sized, stenting-related myocardial infarctions. Prospective, randomized trials are warranted to further assess this cardioprotective effect of statins in coronary intervention.", 
    "137": "Concerns about the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') on health-related quality of life may contribute to their underuse in older adults with and at risk for cardiovascular disease. These concerns also may prevent clinicians from enrolling older patients in clinical trials assessing the efficacy of statins as a preventive therapy for Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "138": "To determine the effects of pravastatin and tocopherol (vitamin E), alone and in combination, on health-related quality of life in older adults.", 
    "139": "Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study.", 
    "140": "Forty-one community-dwelling men and women aged > or = 70 years with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) > or = 3.62 mmol/L (140 mg/dl) participated.", 
    "141": "Subjects received pravastatin for 6 months then pravastatin plus tocopherol for an additional 6 months (group 1), or tocopherol for 6 months then pravastatin plus tocopherol for an additional 6 months (group 2). Dosages were pravastatin 20 mg daily and tocopherol 400 IU daily.", 
    "142": "The following health-related quality-of-life measures were assessed at baseline, after 6 months and after 1 year: health perception, depression, physical function, cognitive function and sleep behaviour. In addition, data on adverse effects and laboratory abnormalities were obtained.", 
    "143": "Pravastatin reduced levels of total cholesterol (-21%, p < 0.001) and LDL-C (-29%, p < 0.001). Health-related quality-of-life scores, physical adverse effects, muscle enzyme levels and liver function tests did not change after 12 months of therapy with pravastatin, tocopherol or their combination.", 
    "144": "Both pravastatin and tocopherol have a good safety profile, are well tolerated and do not adversely affect health-related quality of life in older patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Given the significant beneficial cardiovascular effects of statin therapy in older adults and the potential role of statins in prevention of Alzheimer's disease, concerns about adverse effects on quality of life should not deter use of these medications in this population.", 
    "145": "Although several clinical trials clearly demonstrate a decrease in mortality and morbidity rates for various patient populations with cardiovascular disease, this disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States. Based on various practice surveys and descriptive reports, clinicians apparently are not identifying patients at risk or not treating them to established goals set by national guidelines. Most evidence, including the updated National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, support low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) as the principal target for intervention. The guidelines also emphasize that a low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) alone or in association with hypertriglyceridemia increases the risk of cardiovascular disease; also, epidemiologic data taken as a whole signify that a 1% decrease in HDL levels is associated with a 2-3% increase in risk of coronary heart disease. Low HDL levels occur more frequently than once thought, especially in selected populations such as patients with type 2 diabetes and men. Therapeutic lifestyle changes should be implemented first for any lipid disorder. In patients for whom this approach is not adequate, LDL levels need to be lowered to goals based on risk assessment. In addition, low HDL levels and/or hypertriglyceridemia should be managed with a niacin or fibrate product. However, increases in HDL levels and reductions in triglyceride levels are modest with fibrates compared with the dose-related changes seen with niacin products. Reformulation of niacin into an extended-release form minimizes common adverse effects seen with crystalline or sustained-release niacin, and the beneficial effects on the lipid profile are maintained.", 
    "146": "The statins are among the most widely used pharmaceutical drugs and have shown to be extremely effective in the treatment of dyslipidaemia. The statins are effective in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease, in peripheral and cerebral vascular disease and in a wide variety of patient groups. In addition they have a beneficial effect on the vascular wall and atherosclerotic process, which is not related to their cholesterol-lowering effect. Despite their potency they are relatively well tolerated, with adverse effects mostly as a result of muscle and liver involvement. Some of the issues relating to efficacy and detrimental effects are discussed briefly.", 
    "147": "A provisional matrix consisting of fibrin and fibronectin (FN) is deposited at sites of tissue damage and repair. This matrix serves as a scaffold for fibroblast migration into the wound where these cells deposit new matrix to replace lost or damaged tissue and eventually contract the matrix to bring the margins of the wound together. Tenascin-C is expressed transiently during wound repair in tissue adjacent to areas of injury and contacts the provisional matrix in vivo. Using a synthetic model of the provisional matrix, we have found that tenascin-C regulates cell responses to a fibrin-FN matrix through modulation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and RhoA activation. Cells on fibrin-FN+tenascin-C redistribute their actin to the cell cortex, downregulate focal adhesion formation, and do not assemble a FN matrix. Cells surrounded by a fibrin-FN+tenascin-C matrix are unable to induce matrix contraction. The inhibitory effect of tenascin-C is circumvented by downstream activation of RhoA. FAK is also required for matrix contraction and the absence of FAK cannot be overcome by activation of RhoA. These observations show dual requirements for both FAK and RhoA activities during contraction of a fibrin-FN matrix. The effects of tenascin-C combined with its location around the wound bed suggest that this protein regulates fundamental processes of tissue repair by limiting the extent of matrix deposition and contraction to fibrin-FN-rich matrix in the primary wound area.", 
    "148": "Fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, and its metabolites have been reported to protect against oxidative DNA damage in vitro. Streptozotocin (STZ) has drawn attention as a potential source of oxidative stress that induces genotoxicity. In order to elucidate the antioxidative effects of fluvastatin in vivo, we investigated the effects of 7-day treatment with fluvastatin on DNA damage in STZ-treated mice, as well as the effects of the main fluvastatin metabolites (M2, M3 and M4) and other inhibitors of the same enzyme, pravastatin and simvastatin. Protective effects against DNA damage in the liver and kidney from STZ-treated mice were assessed by the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay, and by detecting 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. A single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (150 mg/kg) increased serum levels of glucose, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and also caused DNA damage in the liver and kidney. Fluvastatin and its metabolites prevented the STZ-induced elevation of DNA damage and inhibited the increase in serum levels of AST, ALT and BUN. Fluvastatin and its metabolites showed protective effects against DNA damage as potent as that of the reference antioxidants (ascorbic acid, trolox and probucol) though pravastatin and simvastatin still lacked protective activity. Fluvastatin protected the mice against STZ-induced DNA damage, and may reduce the risk of oxidative stress in vivo."
