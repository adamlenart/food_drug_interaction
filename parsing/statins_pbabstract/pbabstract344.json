Large-scale clinical trials involving thousands of patients in both primary and secondary prevention have clearly demonstrated that statin therapy will reduce cardiovascular mortality across a broad spectrum of patient subgroups. However, the precise mechanism underlying the benefit of statin therapy has been controversial due to the multiplicity of potential benefits that statins have demonstrated in addition to pure lipid lowering. Recent experimental evidence supports the premise that clinical benefits are related primarily to pleiotropic effects of statins (endothelial function, inflammation, coagulation and plaque vulnerability).", 
    "1": "Many studies show hypercholesterolemia is an even stronger risk factor for coronary heart disease(CHD) in the elderly, and most studies evaluated ischemic strokes separately show a positive association with cholesterol levels. Large prevention studies show HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors significantly decreased major coronary events in the elderly similar to that observed in the younger people, and were also effective in preventing ischemic stroke. For primary prevention, therapeutic life-style change is the first line of therapy for the elderly. However, LDL-lowering drugs can be considered when they are at established CHD, higher risk because of multiple risk factors, or advanced subclinical atherosclerosis. The association of triglycerides level or HDL-cholesterol level and atherosclerotic diseases has been well defined in the elderly.", 
    "2": "Atherosclerotic vascular diseases are expected to remain the major cause of mortality and morbidity globally well. Preventive measures by lifestyle changes(diet, exercise) will play an important role in retarding the onset of these diseases. The 4S, CARE and LIPID study demonstrated the efficacy of a statin on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and on total mortality. The cardioprotective effect of statin is partially due to the cholesterol independent effect. Fibrate also decrease the mortality of patients with ischemic heart disease by improving the fiblolytic state. The association of a statin and a fibrate is reserved to specialized centers, however we should not forget the usefulness of diet.", 
    "3": "Chronic low-grade inflammation may contribute to the increased risk of atherosclerosis in visceral obesity. Statin and fish oil have been reported to have antiinflammatory effects. We studied whether dyslipidemic, obese individuals have increased plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations and whether treatment with atorvastatin and fish oil lowered plasma hs-CRP concentrations.", 
    "4": "We compared plasma hs-CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations in 48 obese individuals with the concentrations in 10 lean normolipidemic men. The obese individuals were then randomized to treatment with atorvastatin (40 mg/day), fish oil (4 g/day), atorvastatin plus fish oil, or matching placebo for 6 weeks.", 
    "5": "Compared with controls, obese individuals had increased hs-CRP [geometric mean, 2.19 mg/L (95% confidence interval, 2.15-3.15 mg/L) vs 0.49 mg/L (0.30- 0.93 mg/L); P <0.001] and IL-6 [351 pg/L (318-449 pg/L) vs 251 pg/L (211-305 pg/L); P <0.01]. Atorvastatin treatment had a significant main effect of decreasing plasma hs-CRP (-0.87 mg/L; 95% confidence interval, -0.10 to -1.60 mg/L; P <0.01) and IL-6 (-70 pg/L; 10 to -140 pg/L; P <0.01), but this was not seen with fish oil. The reductions in hs-CRP with atorvastatin were not significantly correlated to changes in plasma lipids, IL-6, insulin resistance, or cholesterogenesis. Plasma TNF-alpha concentrations in obese individuals, however, were neither statistically different from concentrations in the lean controls nor altered with atorvastatin or fish oil treatment.",

At the 36-month follow-up evaluation, the incidence of new coronary events was 52% in persons treated with aspirin versus 70% in those who were not treated with aspirin (P < 0.0001). The stepwise Cox regression model showed that significant independent predictors of new coronary events were age (risk ratio, 1.05 for each 1-year increase), current cigarette smoking (risk ratio, 2.7), hypertension (risk ratio, 1.7), diabetes mellitus (risk ratio, 2.2), initial serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (risk ratio, 1.01 for each 1-mg/dL increase), initial serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (risk ratio, 0.96 for each 1-mg/dL increase), use of statins (risk ratio, 0.46), and use of aspirin (risk ratio, 0.48).",

Subjects and methods. Subjects (n=401; 56% female; mean age 57 years), who were hypercholesterolaemic despite a diet poor in saturated fat and cholesterol, were treated according to NCEP-ATP II guidelines.

Interventions. Micronized fenofibrate (200 mg day-1, 87 patients) or atorvastatin (10 mg day-1, 94 patients) for a period of 12 weeks. Main outcome measures. Percent change in HDL-C levels.", 
    "15": "After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean percent change from baseline in HDL-C was significantly higher in the micronized fenofibrate group (13.3%) compared with the atorvastatin group (5.3%, P=0.0003). The magnitude of such relative change was inversely related to the baseline HDL-C levels only in the micronized fenofibrate group. Furthermore, in the fenofibrate treatment group, 50.9% of the patients (29 of 57 patients) with a baseline HDL-C <40 mg dL-1 achieved a plasma HDL-C level above 40 mg dL-1 after 12 weeks of treatment versus 27.9% of the patients (19 of 68 patients) in the atorvastatin group (P=0.01).", 
    "16": "On the basis of (1) the greater impact of fenofibrate than atorvastatin on HDL-C levels and (2) the greater proportion of dyslipidemic patients achieving HDL-C levels above 40 mg dL-1 with fenofibrate than atorvastatin, it is suggested that micronized fenofibrate should be considered as a good therapeutic option to treat dyslipidemic patients with low HDL-C and moderately elevated LDL-C concentrations.", 
    "17": "Increased rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) occur with advancing age in both sexes, although CHD rates in women lag behind those of men by about 10 years. There is a sharp increase in CHD rate among women after approximately 50 years of age. The reasons for this are not completely understood and are undoubtedly multifactorial. Cross-sectional data from large-scale population studies suggest that around the time of the menopause, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels increase by approximately 15 to 25%. Because this increase is larger than that observed in men over the same age span and closely approximates that observed in women after oophorectomy, it is likely that reduced circulating estrogen levels associated with menopause play a role in the adverse changes in both blood lipid levels and CHD incidence. There is clear evidence that treating hypercholesterolemia reduces cardiovascular risk in women, as well as in men. In the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines, diet and other lifestyle changes are recommended as first-line therapy. If the treatment goals cannot be achieved through non-pharmacological measures, drug therapy should be added. Of the available lipid-lowering agents, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the clear choice to decrease LDL-cholesterol levels. However the favourable effects of statins on high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels are more modest, and statins are not known to decrease lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels. Estrogen or hormone replacement therapy (ERT/HRT) and nicotinic acid improve LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels and also decrease Lp(a) levels. However, ERT/HRT is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for decreasing CHD risk. Nicotinic acid is particularly useful for decreasing triglyceride levels (as are fibrates) and raising HDL-cholesterol levels. Bile-acid sequestrants reduce LDL-cholesterol and slightly increase HDL-cholesterol levels. Both bile acid sequestrants and ERT/HRT tend to raise triglyceride levels, therefore they should be used cautiously in women with hypertriglyceridaemia. Treatment should be individualised for each patient. It is important to evaluate the primary form of dyslipidaemia, other CHD risk factors, comorbidities, and the extent of lipid improvement needed in order to reach treatment goals. The effects of each type of therapy and potential adverse effects should also be considered.",

    "19": "Diabetes is associated with a high risk for early atherosclerosis. 3/4 of all Type-2 diabetic patients exhibit coronary artery disease.", 
    "20": "Microcirculatory disturbances precede morphologic changes. Especially fluctuations in blood glucose which occur i.e. in the postprandial state in badly controlled diabetic subjects, lead to an activation of protein kinase C beta and to stimulation of extracellular matrix proteins and cytokines. NO-dependent vasodilation is reduced. Postprandial blood glucose peaks are correlated with the intima-media thickness of the carotid artery and appear to be more important than fasting glucose values in multivariate analyses. After coronary interventions there is an enhanced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 synthesis in diabetic patients compared to controls. This enhanced synthesis contributes to an exaggerated intravascular thrombogenicity. Already within a few days statin therapy leads to an increase in vasodilatory capacity irrespective of plasma lipid concentrations.", 
    "21": "Atherosclerosis and development of plaques are functionally and morphologically different between diabetic patients and controls. Blood glucose fluctuations, mainly occurring in the postprandial state enhance atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic patients and in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. In addition to an optimized antidiabetic treatment, statin treatment is inhibitory concerning the development of atherosclerotic lesions.", 
    "22": "Saphenous vein (SV) grafts are commonly used to bypass coronary arteries that are diseased due to atherosclerosis. However, the development of intimal hyperplasia in such grafts can lead to patency-threatening stenosis and re-occlusion of the vessel. The proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells (SMC) play key roles in the development of intimal hyperplasia, and an agent that inhibits both of these processes therefore has therapeutic potential. A prerequisite for SMC proliferation and migration in vivo is degradation of the basement membrane, achieved by secretion of the matrix-degrading gelatinases matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that also have direct effects on SMC function. Here we report that neointima formation in organ-cultured human SV segments is inhibited by simvastatin, an effect that is associated with reduced MMP-9 activity. Additionally, our work shows that simvastatin not only inhibits proliferation, but importantly also inhibits invasion (migration through a matrix barrier), of cultured human SV SMC. Thus simvastatin treatment appears to inhibit neointima formation as a result of combined inhibition of SMC proliferation and invasion. The potential intracellular mechanisms by which statins affect SMC proliferation and migration, and thus attenuate intimal hyperplasia, are discussed, with particular emphasis on the role of MMP-9.", 
    "23": "A series of studies were conducted to explore the mechanism of the pharmacokinetic interaction between simvastatin (SV) and gemfibrozil (GFZ) reported recently in human subjects. After administration of a single dose of SV (4 mg/kg p.o.) to dogs pretreated with GFZ (75 mg/kg p.o., twice daily for 5 days), there was an increase (approximately 4-fold) in systemic exposure to simvastatin hydroxy acid (SVA), but not to SV, similar to the observation in humans. GFZ pretreatment did not increase the ex vivo hydrolysis of SV to SVA in dog plasma. In dog and human liver microsomes, GFZ exerted a minimal inhibitory effect on CYP3A-mediated SVA oxidation, but did inhibit SVA glucuronidation. After i.v. administration of [(14)C]SVA to dogs, GFZ treatment significantly reduced (2-3-fold) the plasma clearance of SVA and the biliary excretion of SVA glucuronide (together with its cyclization product SV), but not the excretion of a major oxidative metabolite of SVA, consistent with the in vitro findings in dogs. Among six human UGT isozymes tested, UGT1A1 and 1A3 were capable of catalyzing the glucuronidation of both GFZ and SVA. Further studies conducted in human liver microsomes with atorvastatin (AVA) showed that, as with SVA, GFZ was a less potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4-mediated oxidation of this drug than its glucuronidation. However, with cerivastatin (CVA), the glucuronidation as well as the CYP2C8- and CYP3A4-mediated oxidation pathways were much more susceptible to inhibition by GFZ than was observed with SVA or AVA. Collectively, the results of these studies provide metabolic insight into the nature of drug-drug interaction between GFZ and statins, and a possible explanation for the enhanced susceptibility of CVA to interactions with GFZ.",

During the past several years additional actions of statins unrelated to cholesterol reduction have been identified which includes antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Since atherosclerosis is a form of inflammation and the immune system play an important role in its pathogenesis, pleiotropic effect of statins may provide complementary explanation to their clinical benefit. This article reviews the data regarding the antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of the statins that are available in the treatment of atherosclerosis and possibly may be applicable in other inflammatory diseases or conditions with the involvement of the immune system.",

During 5 years of exposure, the incidence of fatal and nonfatal cancers was similar between pravastatin and placebo groups. No differences in noncardiovascular serious adverse events were detected.

Study medication was withdrawn in 3 pravastatin and 7 placebo patients due to creatine phosphokinase elevations; no cases of mild or severe myopathy were reported.

    "33": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are of proven clinical benefit in coronary heart disease, at least in those patients who do not have overt chronic heart failure (CHF). However, as there have been no prospective clinical trials of statins in CHF patients, the question arises as to whether the benefits observed in the absence of CHF can be necessarily inferred in those patients in whom CHF is established. In this review, the evidence base stating support of the use of statins in CHF is presented, as well as theoretical considerations as to why these agents may not necessarily be of benefit in this setting. The beneficial potential of statins clearly relates to their plaque stabilization properties and associated improvements in endothelial function, which together should reduce the risk of further infarction and, perhaps, the ischemic burden on the failing ventricle. Furthermore, these agents may have beneficial effects independent of lipid lowering. These include actions on neoangiogenesis, downregulation of AT(1) receptors, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine activity and favorable modulation of the autonomic nervous system. The potential adverse effects of statins in CHF include reduction in levels of coenzyme Q10 (which may further exacerbate oxidative stress in CHF) and loss of the protection that lipoproteins may provide through binding and detoxifying endotoxins entering the circulation via the gut. In support of these possibilities are epidemiologic data linking a lower serum cholesterol with a poorer prognosis in CHF. These uncertainties indicate the need for a definitive outcome trial to assess the efficacy and safety of statins in CHF, despite their current widespread, non-evidence based use in this population.",

The decrease in CRP lowering was thus fully established by 1 month and this response was independent of lipid and lipoprotein changes as well as atorvastatin doses.", 
    "57": "Atorvastatin significantly decreases CRP concentrations after 4 weeks of therapy. These results may be important with respect to the early benefit of statin therapy.", 
    "58": "High cholesterol levels are a known risk factor for coronary events. The molecular links between high serum cholesterol and the increased thrombogenicity of the arterial wall are still matter of investigation. In the present study we investigate the relationship between plasma cholesterol, thrombus formation and TF expression in a atherosclerotic rabbit model. Hypercholesterolemic rabbits showed a pronounced TF staining as well as NF-kappaB activation in the aortic arch. A consistent vessel wall platelet deposition was also observed. Treatment with fluvastatin reduced lipid accumulation, TF overexpression (-60%), NF-kappaB activation, and platelet deposition (-56%). In vitro studies showed that the drug upregulated IkappaB alpha in unstimulated as well as in TNFalpha-stimulated cells and also impaired the TNFalpha-induced Cdc42 prenylation, indicating that fluvastatin interferes with the transcriptional activation of TF gene. These results indicate that the prothrombotic phenotype of arterial wall, associated with elevated serum cholesterol levels, is mediated by TF overexpression. Fluvastatin treatment reduces the prothrombotic tendency by inhibiting TF synthesis.", 
    "59": "An assay employing automated solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with positive ion TurboIonspray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) was developed and validated for the quantification of rosuvastatin (Crestor) in human plasma. Rosuvastatin is a hydroxy-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor currently under development by AstraZeneca. The standard curve range in human plasma was 0.1-30 ng/ml with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) verified at 0.1 ng/ml. Inaccuracy was less than 8% and imprecision less than +/-15% at all concentration levels. There was no interference from endogenous substances. The analyte was stable in human plasma following three freeze/thaw cycles and for up to 6 months following storage at both -20 and -70 degrees C. The assay was successfully applied to the analysis of rosuvastatin in human plasma samples derived from clinical trials, allowing the pharmacokinetics of the compound to be determined.", 
    "60": "Few things are better understood within the medical community than the relationship between elevated total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, cardiovascular disease and death. There is consensus in the treatment guidelines of numerous national and international bodies that cholesterol levels in at-risk patients should be reduced to target levels that have been shown in population studies to be associated with low rates of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, dyslipidaemia continues to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. The 'landmark' statin trials have demonstrated unequivocally that effective lipid-lowering therapy significantly decreases CHD morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, these benefits of lipid-lowering therapy are not limited to middle-aged men, but extend across a broad range of patient populations. Recent trial data suggest that lowering LDL-C to target levels is possible in a substantial proportion of patients when statins are administered aggressively and results in a greater reduction in the risk of major coronary events. This reduction in events is seen in patients with stable coronary disease as well as those treated immediately after an acute coronary syndrome. Although strong clinical and angiographic evidence shows that intensive treatment prevents morbidity and saves lives, indications are that clinicians are still waiting too long to treat dyslipidaemia and when treatment is initiated it is often at inadequate dosages. Undertreatment of dyslipidaemia is an issue that the healthcare community can no longer ignore.",

    "65": "Cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. Endothelial dysfunction predicts cardiovascular outcome. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, which may be caused by dyslipidemia. Statin therapy restores endothelial function in hyperlipidemic patients. Therefore, we hypothesize a beneficial effect of atorvastatin on NO-dependent vasodilation in patients with type 2 diabetes and mild dyslipidemia (low density lipoproteins >4.0 mmol/L and/or triglycerides >1.8 mmol/L). We evaluated the effect of intensive lipid lowering (4 weeks of 80 mg atorvastatin once daily) on vasoreactivity in 23 patients with type 2 diabetes by using venous occlusion plethysmography. Twenty-one control subjects were matched for age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, and smoking habits. The ratio of blood flows in the infused (measurement [M]) and noninfused (control [C]) arm was calculated for each recording (M/C ratio), and M/C% indicates the percentage change from the baseline M/C ratio. Serotonin-induced NO-dependent vasodilation was significantly blunted (52+/-30 versus 102+/-66 M/C%, P<0.005), and nitroprusside-induced endothelium-independent vasodilation was modestly reduced (275+/-146 versus 391+/-203 M/C%, P<0.05) in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with control subjects. Despite significant reduction of total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, and triglycerides (5.8+/-1.0 to 3.2+/-0.6 [P<0.0001], 4.1+/-1.1 to 1.8+/-0.7 [P<0.0001], and 2.2+/-1.3 to 1.4+/-0.5 [P<0.05] mmol/L, respectively), no effect on NO-dependent (59+/-44 M/C%) and endothelium-independent (292+/-202 M/C%) vasodilation was demonstrated. These data suggest that intensive lipid lowering by atorvastatin has no effect on NO availability in forearm resistance arteries in type 2 diabetic patients. Other factors, such as hyperglycemia, may be a more important contributing factor regarding impaired vasoreactivity in this patient group.", 
    "66": "Steroid intermediates of the cholesterol synthesis pathway are characterized by rapid turnover rates relative to cholesterol due to their small pool size. Because the small pools will label rapidly, these intermediates may provide valuable information about the incorporation of isotopes in de novo synthesis of cholesterol and related compounds. The labeling of cholesterol synthesis intermediates from [1-(13)C]acetate was investigated in human subjects and in liver cell models by means of isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA). In human subjects, infusing [1-(13)C]acetate into the duodenum for 12 h demonstrated that approximately 50% of the plasma lathosterol pool was derived from de novo synthesis during this interval. The lipogenic acetyl-CoA precursor pool enrichment reached a constant value within 3 h of the start of the infusion. In vitro studies indicated that liver cell models decrease de novo lathosterol synthesis when cholesterol synthesis is inhibited by statins or cholesterol-containing serum. We propose a new calculation to increase the accuracy and precision of cholesterol synthesis estimates in vivo combining the ISA of lathosterol and cholesterol.", 
    "67": "While the effects of bisphosphonates on bone-resorbing osteoclasts have been well documented, the effects of bisphosphonates on other cell types are not as well studied. Recently, we reported that bisphosphonates have direct effects on bone-forming human fetal osteoblast cells (hFOB). In this report, the role of the mevalonate pathway in the actions of bisphosphonates on hFOB, and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells was examined. These studies included a novel bisphosphonate analog, the anhydride formed between arabinocytidine 5' phosphate and etidronate (Ara-CBP). Ara-CBP was the most potent inhibitor of hFOB and MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, and stimulator of hFOB cell mineralization compared to etidronate, the anhydride formed between AMP and etidronate (ABP), pamidronate, and zoledronate. Inhibition of hFOB cell proliferation by Ara-CBP and zoledronate was partially reversed by mevalonate pathway intermediates, and stimulation of hFOB cell mineralization was completely reversed by mevalonate pathway intermediates. These results suggest that zoledronate and Ara-CBP act, at least in part, via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway in hFOB cells. In contrast, none of the mevalonate pathway intermediates reversed the inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation by the bisphosphonates, or the effects of pamidronate on hFOB cells. As a positive control, the effects of mevastatin on hFOB and MDA-MB-231 cells were completely reversed by mevalonate. In summary, these data suggest that zoledronate and Ara-CBP induce human osteoblast differentiation via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. In contrast, the inhibition of MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation by the bisphosphonates appears to be through mechanisms other than inhibition of the mevalonate pathway.", 
    "68": "HMG CoA reductase inhibitiors (statins) have been shown to be effective lipid lowering agents and are able to significantly reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. Recent clinical and experimental data suggest that the benefit of statins may extend beyond their hepatic effects on serum cholesterol levels. This review summarizes the current evidence and the molecular mechanisms of the direct effects of statins on plaque stability, inflammation, endothelial function, oxidative stress, thrombosis and stroke. Furthermore, recent data on the effects of statins on bone marrow, bone density and dementia are described. In summary, statins have emerged as a novel and powerful tool to study cardiovascular biology, including protein isoprenylation, small G protein function, leukocyte activity and endothelial progenitor cells. These pleiotropic properties of statins may have important clinical implications in addition to lowering serum cholesterol.", 
    "69": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of death in most developed countries and in many developing countries like Mexico. Epidemiologic studies initiated in the middle of the last century found that hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, and other conditions are important precursors of atherosclerosis. With this knowledge, prevention of CAD was started. Some countries implemented a population strategy aimed at improving health-oriented behavior, mainly nutrition, smoking, and physical exercise in the entire population. The favorable changes in risk factors and better medical treatment for CAD patients have resulted in decreased coronary mortality over the past three decades. Randomized trials of antihypertensive treatment have shown that reduction of blood pressure leads to a decreased incidence of stroke and coronary events. Similarly, large secondary and primary prevention clinical trials of statin therapy have conclusively demonstrated the benefit of cholesterol lowering in preventing coronary morbidity and mortality. Despite this large body of scientific evidence, surveys in different countries show that in the population at large and particularly, in patients with documented CAD, preventive medical therapies are underutilized and, as a consequence, many patients are not achieving the recommended goals. Measures that increase compliance by both clinicians and patients to regimens with proven benefits are urgently required.", 
    "70": "The clinical decision to treat hypercholesterolemia is premised on an awareness of patient risk, and cardiac risk prediction models offer a practical means of determining such risk. However, these models are based on observational cohorts where estimates of the treatment benefit are largely inferred. The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) provides an opportunity to develop a risk-benefit prediction model from the actual observed primary event reduction seen in the trial. Five-year Cox model risk estimates were derived from all WOSCOPS subjects (n = 6,595 men, aged 45 to 64 years old at baseline) using factors previously shown to be predictive of definite fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Model risk factors included age, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol/ high-density lipoprotein ratio (TC/HDL), current smoking, diabetes, family history of fatal coronary heart disease, nitrate use or angina, and treatment (placebo/ 40-mg pravastatin). All risk factors were expressed as categorical variables to facilitate risk assessment. Risk estimates were incorporated into a simple, hand-held slide rule or risk tool. Risk estimates were identified for 5-year age bands (45 to 65 years), 4 categories of TC/HDL ratio (<5.5, 5.5 to <6.5, 6.5 to <7.5, > or = 7.5), 2 levels of diastolic blood pressure (<90, > or = 90 mm Hg), from 0 to 3 additional risk factors (current smoking, diabetes, family history of premature fatal coronary heart disease, nitrate use or angina), and pravastatin treatment. Five-year risk estimates ranged from 2% in very low-risk subjects to 61% in the very high-risk subjects. Risk reduction due to pravastatin treatment averaged 31%. Thus, the Cardiovascular Event Reduction Tool (CERT) is a risk prediction model derived from the WOSCOPS trial. Its use will help physicians identify patients who will benefit from cholesterol reduction.", 
    "71": "The long-term effects of the 3-hydoxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, on exercise electrocardiography (ECG) test performance and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity were compared with those of conventional lipid-lowering drugs in hypercholesterolemic patients with no history of myocardial infarction or stroke. One thousand two hundred and seventeen patients were randomly assigned with mean serum cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of 6.98 +/- 0.91mmol/L, 2.08 +/- 1.87mmol/L, 1.38 +/- 0.44mmol/L, and 5.07 +/- 1.14 mmol/L, respectively, and received either pravastatin at a dose of 10-20mg/day (group P) or one of the conventional lipid-lowering drugs such as fibrates, nicotinic acid, and probucol (group C). The numbers of patients available for analysis in groups P and C were 305 and 278 at year 1, 261 and 216 at year 2, 206 and 184 at year 3, 159 and 122 at year 4, and 103 and 81 at year 5. Over the 3.2 year mean follow-up period, the reduction in serum LDL cholesterol levels was significantly greater (p<0.01) in group P (-24.3%) than in group C (-16.0%). Serum HDL cholesterol levels increased in group P (+11.6%), but decreased in group C (-0.3%) (p<0.01). There were no significant differences in the rate of patients who exhibited ischemic changes to exercise ECG test (ischemic responders) between the 2 groups. Coronary heart diseases (CHD) occurred in 6 patients in group P and 13 in group C; pravastatin significantly reduced CHD risk (reduction rate 0.369; 95% confidence interval 0.140-0.970; p<0.05). No significant differences existed between the treatment groups in terms of the number of strokes (group P, 6; group C, 7) or deaths unrelated to CHD (group P, 3; group C, 2). Although pravastatin did not improve the proportion of ischemic responders on exercise testing, it reduced CHD risk and serum LDL cholesterol levels more significantly than conventional lipid-lowering drugs without adversely affecting the risk of stroke and non-CHD death in hypercholesterolemic patients.", 
    "72": "Epidemiological studies have established that low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent studies have demonstrated that low HDL-C levels, and high triglycerides and total cholesterol levels are independent predictors of CHD, and that the combination of these lipid abnormalities increases the risk of coronary events. In lipid-modifying intervention studies, agents that raise HDL-C levels have been shown to reduce the incidence of major coronary events. The VA-HIT study consisted of patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels similar to those recommended by several guidelines but with low levels of HDL-C. This trial demonstrated that raising HDL-C levels with gemfibrozil reduced the risk of CHD-related events. While the mechanisms by which HDL-C exerts its anti-atherogenic effects have yet to be fully elucidated, its role in the reverse transport of cholesterol and the beneficial effects on endothelial function are plausible explanations for these actions. Although LDL-C reduction is the primary goal in the treatment of dyslipidaemia, current guidelines recognise low HDL-C levels as a major risk factor for CHD. Indeed, the NCEP ATP III guidelines suggest that the treatment of isolated low HDL-C levels in CHD patients or individuals with CHD risk equivalents should be considered. The differing abilities of statins to raise HDL-C levels may be an important factor when making treatment decisions. New lipid-modifying drugs with beneficial effects on both HDL-C and LDL-C levels would be desirable additions to the currently available therapeutic options.",

A further 2.4% (95% CI 2.0% to 2.8%), including 0.4% (0.2% to 0.6%) with diabetes, were identified as candidates for primary prevention of coronary heart disease according to the NSF for coronary heart disease.

A 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled study was conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety of pitavastatin compared with pravastatin, an agent for using to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in hypercholesterolemic patients. Patients were recruited at 43 institutes in Japan. Following more than 4 weeks run-in period, 240 patients were randomized to receive 2 mg of pitavastatin or 10 mg of pravastatin daily. At 12 weeks post-randomization, the pitavastatin group showed significantly lower LDL-C levels by -37.6% from baseline compared with -18.4% in the pravastatin group (P<0.05). Pitavastatin also significantly lowered total cholesterol (TC) by -28.2% compared with -14.0% of pravastatin (P<0.05). The LDL-C target level of <140 mg/dl was attained in 75% of the patients treated with pitavastatin, compared with 36% of those in the pravastatin group (P<0.05). Pitavastatin also significantly reduced triglycerides (TG), apo B, C-II and C-III, compared with pravastatin, and increased HDL-C, apo A-I and A-II, to the same extent of pravastatin. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events and measuring clinical laboratory parameters. The adverse event profile was similar for both treatment groups and neither treatment caused clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities. These results indicated that pitavastatin was more effective than pravastatin, and both drugs were well-tolerated in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.",

Among patients under fenofibrate therapy, changes in TG levels were negatively associated with changes in LDL peak particle size (r=-0.54, P<0.0007), whereas no such association was found in pravastatin-treated patients. The prevalence of patients with small, dense LDL particles (as defined by LDL particle diameter <255.5 A) was reduced from 69.4 to 30.6% (P<0.05) among fenofibrate-treated patients as opposed to 81.4 to 72.1% (NS) in patients who received pravastatin.", 
    "84": "As pravastatin treatment had no effect on LDL size, it is suggested that the additional effect of fenofibrate therapy on LDL size may contribute to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) beyond what can be expected from the reduction in LDL cholesterol concentration in type IIa dyslipidemic patients.", 
    "85": "Pravastatin sodium (pravastatin), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), when orally administered to male Japanese White (JW) rabbits at 1-30 mg/kg for 21 days, decreased the concentrations of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, pravastatin did not change the concentration of serum triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol. On day 21, LDL-cholesterol was significantly decreased at doses higher than 3 mg/kg, whereas HDL-cholesterol was significantly reduced at doses higher than 10 mg/kg. The concentrations of hepatic LDL receptor proteins determined by immunoblot analysis increased at the same dose at which the concentrations of LDL-cholesterol decreased. The serum concentrations of HDL-cholesterol were decreased at the same dose at which VLDL-cholesterol secretion rates from the liver were reduced. The present study suggests that in JW rabbits, pravastatin decreases the serum concentration of LDL-cholesterol through an LDL receptor pathway, whereas the agent lowers the concentration of HDL-cholesterol by the mechanisms associated with a reduction of VLDL-cholesterol secretion from the liver.", 
    "86": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a non-specific but sensitive marker of underlying systemic inflammation. High CRP plasma levels correlate with risk for future cardiovascular events. The present study evaluated the effects of atorvastatin (10-40 mg) and bezafibrate (400 mg) on CRP concentrations after 6 and 12 months of treatment in 103 patients with combined (mixed) hyperlipidemia. The number of cardiovascular risk factors present in a given patient was associated with baseline CRP levels. After 6 months and 1 year, atorvastatin treatment was associated with significant (P<0.001) decreases from baseline of CRP concentrations by 29 and 43%, respectively, while bezafibrate-treated patients showed non-significant reductions of 2.3 and 14.6%, respectively (P=0.056 and 0.005 for the respective differences between the two treatment arms at 6 months and 1 year). The magnitude of change in CRP after 1 year was directly related to baseline CRP levels. Covariance analysis showed that CRP decreases in the atorvastatin group were unrelated to total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol reductions; however, they were directly related to triglyceride changes (r=0.28, P=0.047) and inversely related to HDL cholesterol changes (r=-0.28, P=0.045). A model including baseline CRP values and treatment effect showed that atorvastatin use was a significant predictor of change in CRP levels over time (beta=0.82, P=0.023). These results suggest a potential anti-atherosclerotic additional benefit of atorvastatin in patients at a risk of cardiovascular disease.",

The risk of CHD is substantially increased in people with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the most effective drug class for lowering LDL-C. Long-term prospective studies have shown that statin therapy significantly reduces the risk of CHD morbidity and mortality in patients without or with evidence of established CHD (primary and secondary prevention, respectively). In 1988, treatment guidelines were first issued by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel I (NCEP-ATP I), then revised in 1993 (ATP II), to provide recommendations for the prevention and management of high cholesterol in adults. Despite these guidelines, recent national surveys have shown that effective therapies are being under-utilised and they often fail to achieve LDL-C goals established by NCEP-ATP II. The reasons appear to be multifactorial but include issues related to efficacy, safety, the potential for adverse drug reactions, failure to prescribe appropriate medication or dose and noncompliance with therapy. In the first major update of NCEP guidelines in almost a decade, the current ATP III recommendations have placed an increased number of Americans in the high-risk category, inviting even more aggressive therapy and escalating the challenge of reaching NCEP goals. New statins that may have even greater efficacy and less potential for drug interactions may help address some concerns associated with the failure to achieve treatment goals.",

Recent studies suggest it also has growth inhibitory properties. Posttranslational farnesyl or geranylgeranylation of low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins such as RAS and RHO are thought to be an essential step in activation of phosphorylation cascades such as the RAS-RAF-1-MEK-1-MAPK/ERK pathway which stimulate cell proliferation. In this study, we evaluated lovastatin effects on meningioma cell proliferation and activation of the MEK-1-MAPK/ERK pathway. The effect of lovastatin on cell proliferation was assessed in eight human meningioma cell cultures stimulated by platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and fetal bovine serum (FBS). Concomitant lovastatin effects on phosphorylation/activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) kinase (MEK-1) and MAPK/ERK were assessed by Western blot. Whether lovastatin acts via a mevalonate-dependent mechanism was also evaluated. Coadministration of lovastatin completely blocked PDGF-BB, CSF, and FBS stimulation of [3H]-thymidine incorporation and cell proliferation. Lovastatin inhibited PDGF-BB's stimulatory effect in a dose dependent manner. Concomitant with its growth inhibitory effects, lovastatin reduced phosphorylation/activation of MEK-1/2 in five meningiomas and MAPK/ERK in seven. Coadministration of mevalonate with lovastatin partially restored PDGF's mitogenic effect. Lovastatin is a potent inhibitor of meningioma cell proliferation which may act in part by reducing activation of MEK-1-MAPK/ERK pathway. Additional studies are warranted to assess whether lovastatin and similar HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors represent a new adjunctive chemotherapy for recurrent meningiomas.", 
    "96": "Abnormal spontaneous potentials, specifically myokymia, can occur from various causes. We present the case of a 64-year-old woman with a 12-month history of left leg weakness and difficulty descending stairs. The patients' medical history was significant for breast carcinoma (no node involvement), hypercholesterolemia, and vitamin B(12) deficiency. She previously had a modified radical mastectomy and received chemotherapy (5-flurouracil, methotrexate, Cytoxan [cyclophosphamide]), but received no radiation. She took simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia and received vitamin B(12) injections for her B(12) deficiency. She initially noticed her symptoms when she began taking simvastatin, and they were exacerbated when her dose was increased from 10 to 20mg/d. Electrodiagnostic studies were performed twice at a 6-month interval. Nerve conduction studies were normal, but the initial needle electromyography showed significant myokymic discharges in bilateral iliopsoas, adductor magnus, and left deltoid muscles. The second electromyograph had similar findings, except for the absence of myokymic discharges in the left deltoid muscle. The possible origins of these myokymic discharges are discussed.", 
    "97": "We examined the effect of atorvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, on the kinetics of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) metabolism in 25 viscerally obese men in a placebo-controlled study. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoB kinetics were measured using an iv bolus injection of [(2)H(3)]leucine. ApoB isotopic enrichment was measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Kinetic parameters were derived by using a multicompartmental model (SAAM-II). Compared with the placebo group, atorvastatin treatment resulted in significant (P < 0.001) decreases in total cholesterol (-34%), triglyceride (-19%), LDL cholesterol (-42%), total apoB (-39%), and lathosterol (-86%); VLDL-apoB, IDL-apoB, and LDL-apoB pool sizes also fell significantly (P < 0.002) by -27%, -22%, and -41%, respectively. This was associated with an increase in the fractional catabolic rates of VLDL-apoB (+58%, P = 0.019), IDL-apoB (+40%, P = 0.049), and LDL-apoB (+111%, P = 0.001). However, atorvastatin did not significantly alter the production and conversion rates of apoB in all lipoproteins. We conclude that in obese subjects, atorvastatin decreases the plasma concentration of all apoB-containing lipoproteins chiefly by increasing their catabolism and not by decreasing their production or secretion. This may be owing to up-regulation of hepatic receptors as a consequence of inhibition of cholesterogenesis.", 
    "98": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a prototypic marker of inflammation. Numerous prospective studies in healthy volunteers have confirmed that high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) predicts cardiovascular events (CVEs), and hsCRP seems additive to an elevated total cholesterol level and a total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio in men and women in predicting risk. In smokers and people with metabolic syndrome, hsCRP levels are elevated; in elderly people, there seems to be a relationship between hsCRP and CVEs and mortality. Several properties of CRP make it proatherogenic; however; pending further studies, it should be considered as a risk marker. In people with acute coronary syndromes, hsCRP measurement may be valuable. Elevated levels in the highest quantile seem to predict greater mortality and poorer prognosis in patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction (MI). While hsCRP is a strong independent predictor of risk of future MI, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and vascular death, the validity of hsCRP as a risk marker needs to be assessed in all populations. Weight loss, statin drugs, aspirin, and high-dose alpha tocopherol therapy could affect hsCRP. It has its greatest validity as an adjunctive measure in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

In this prospective, placebo-controlled study, 19 renal transplant recipients (11 male 8 female, mean age 31.2 +/- 8.4 years) with good allograft function (serum creatinine <2 mg/dl) more than 6 months after transplantation were included. All the patients had hyperlipidemia (serum cholesterol >230 mg/dl and/or LDL-cholesterol >130 mg/dl) despite dietary interventions. The patients were treated with a triple immunosuppressive regimen. After a 8-week period of placebo plus diet regimen, the patients were put on fluvastatin plus diet for another 8 weeks. The patients were followed for its effect on lipid parameters and side effects.

Serum levels of triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels did not vary under fluvastatin. Serum lipoprotein (a) levels were also unchanged during the whole study period (24.9 +/- 19.4 vs 23.1 +/- 19.8 mg/dl, p > 0.05). We concluded that fluvastatin effectively decreased atherogenic lipoproteins such as serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, Apo B in posttransplant hyperlipidemia, however fluvastatin had no effect on another independent risk factor of atherogenesis, serum lipoprotein (a) levels.",

Case and control women were matched by age, general practice, duration of prescription history in the General Practice Research Database, and index date. Adjusting for history of benign breast disease, body mass index, and use of hormone replacement therapy, women currently treated with statins had an estimated relative risk for breast cancer of 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.6-1.6) compared to women without hyperlipidaemia. Untreated hyperlipidaemia was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (estimated relative risk 1.6; 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.5). The estimated relative risk among women currently receiving only non-statin lipid-lowering drugs was similar to that of women with untreated hyperlipidaemia (1.8; 95% confidence interval 0.9-3.4).

Despite a number of important study limitations, MIRACL's findings and the prior observation that inpatient initiation of lipid-lowering therapy is associated with higher rates of subsequent utilization, suggest that it is prudent to begin statin therapy when patients present with an acute coronary syndrome.",

Applying algorithms or scoring systems can be helpful in estimating an individual patient's risk, but the basic tools available in everyday clinical practice can be used to alert physicians to elevated CAD risk in their patients. Those patients whose LDL-C level is at or above 220 mg/dL (5.69 mmol/L) should routinely and deservedly get clinical attention, but they account for only 2.5% to 5% of the population. Those with an \"average\" LDL-C level number in the millions, and from this patient pool come the coronary events that fill clinics and hospitals. Aggressive treatment approaches are required to meet NCEP objectives, and every indication suggests that these goals are just the minimum. The third report of the NCEP Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) has broadened the indications for drug therapy, reclarifying diabetes and peripheral vascular or cardiovascular disease equivalents and using a global evaluation concept, which will identify 30 million Americans in need of drug treatment. The statins safely and effectively lower LDL-C levels, which is the basis for instituting drug therapy, according to NCEP guidelines. Using these drugs also raises HDL-C levels, which is somewhat protective, and decreases triglyceride levels. The efficacy of statin therapy in both primary and secondary prevention of CAD is now well established. If used more often when dietary therapy fails, which happens quite often, and in doses sufficient to work effectively, statins have the power to turn the corner on the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic coronary disease in the United States.",

Recently, much attention has been focused on the atherogenesis of small, dense LDL, remnant lipoprotein and isolated hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is known to be deeply involved in the pathogenesis of all of these abnormal lipoprotein profiles. Therefore, treatment of hypertriglyceridemia as well as hypercholesterolemia must be fully discussed.

In Periods 1 and 2, the biological effectiveness of LDL apheresis was comparable. Atorvastatin (40 mg daily) improved the blood levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, but lowered HDL-cholesterol values. Increasing the daily dose of atorvastatin from 40 mg to 80 mg did not significantly improve LDL-cholesterol levels.

Newer agents in this class (e.g. rosuvastatin) have been developed that have proven to be more effective at lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). New formulations of drugs such as nicotinic acid can improve treatment regimens and reduce unpleasant side-effects, thereby improving patient compliance with this therapy. In terms of developing novel drugs, the introduction of cholesterol absorption inhibitors (e.g. ezetimibe) and ACAT inhibitors (e.g. avasimibe) will provide clinicians with therapies that exploit different therapeutic pathways to those currently being utilised. Combining these agents with statins could produce greater improvements in lipid profile than those seen to date.

    "157": "The treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), which includes mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, has been in a state of continual change over recent decades, as new therapies are constantly emerging in the search for more effective treatments for the disease. However, prognosis and survival of patients with CTCL remains dependent upon overall clinical stage (stage IA-IVB) at presentation, as well as response to therapy. Past therapies have been limited by toxicity or the lack of consistently durable responses, and few treatments have been shown to actually alter survival, especially in the late stages of disease. Even aggressive chemotherapy has not been shown to improve overall survival compared to conservative sequential therapy in advanced disease, and adds the risk of immunosuppressive complications. Over the last decade, extracorporeal photopheresis has been the only single treatment that has been shown to improve survival in patients with Sezary syndrome, although its true efficacy and place in combination therapy remain unclear. Much of the focus of current research has been on combinations of skin-directed therapies and biological response modifiers, which improve response rates. The results of various trials over the years have also brought into favor the use of post-remission maintenance therapy with topical corticosteroids, topical mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard), interferon-alpha, or phototherapy to prevent disease relapse. Recent novel developments in CTCL therapy include oral bexarotene, a retinoid X receptor-selective retinoid that has activity in all stages of CTCL, and the topical gel formulation of bexarotene, which plays a role in treating localized lesions. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, oral systemic bexarotene has the advantage of a 48% overall response rate at a dosage of 300 mg/m(2)/day, and avoids immunosuppression and risk of central line and catheter-related infectious complications that are associated with other systemic therapies. Monitoring of triglycerides and use of concomitant lipid-lowering agents and thyroid replacement is required in most patients. Also recently FDA-approved, denileukin diftitox is the first of a novel class of fusion toxin proteins and is selective for interleukin-2R (CD25+) T cells, targeting the malignant T cell clones in CTCL. Denileukin diftitox is associated with capillary leak syndrome in 20 to 30% of patients, which may be ameliorated by hydration and corticosteroids. Higher response rates are possible by combining bexarotene with \"statin\" drugs and active CTCL therapies. Studies are being conducted on combining bexarotene and denileukin diftitox with other modalities. Biological response modifier therapies that are in current or future investigational trials include topical tazarotene, pegylated interferon, interleukin-2, and interleukin-12. At the forefront of systemic chemotherapy development, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and pentostatin appear to have the greatest potential for success in CTCL therapy. Bone marrow transplantation, which is currently limited by the risk of graft-versus-host disease, offers the greatest potential for disease cure. Further developments for CTCL may include more selective immunomodulatory agents, vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies.",

    "159": "Animal experimental studies have demonstrated that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression correlates with neointima formation and is prevented by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). In the present study we have investigated the underlying mechanism of action of these drugs in isolated segments of the rat aorta. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) plus interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) synergistically induce iNOS gene expression in the endothelium but not in the smooth muscle of these segments while constitutive endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) abundance was markedly reduced. Pre-treatment with 1 - 10 microM atorvastatin, cerivastatin or pravastatin decreased TNFalpha plus IFNgamma stimulated iNOS expression in the endothelium irrespective of the presence of the HMG-CoA reductase product mevalonate (400 microM). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments confirmed that the combination of TNFalpha plus IFNgamma causes activation of the transcription factors STAT-1 and NF-kappaB in native endothelial cells. Neutralization of these transcription factors by employing the corresponding decoy oligonucleotides confirmed their involvement in TNFalpha plus IFNgamma stimulated iNOS expression. Translocation of both transcription factors was attenuated by atorvastatin, and this effect was insensitive to exogenous mevalonate. The present findings thus demonstrate a specific HMG-CoA reductase-independent inhibitory effect of statins, namely atorvastatin, on cytokine-stimulated transcription factor activation in native endothelial cells in situ and the subsequent expression of a gene product implicated in vascular inflammation. This effect may be therapeutically relevant and in addition provide an explanation for the reported rapid onset of action of these drugs in humans.", 
    "160": "Rosuvastatin (Crestor, AstraZeneca) is a new synthetic statin that exhibits a number of highly desirable pharmacologic characteristics. The drug has a high affinity for the active site of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and exhibits greater potency in inhibiting enzyme activity and cholesterol synthesis in vitro than other statins. The effects of rosuvastatin are selective for hepatic cells, and there is minimal uptake of the drug by nonhepatic tissues. The vast majority of biologic activity of the drug is associated with the parent compound, which does not appear to undergo extensive metabolism. Hepatic metabolism appears to be minimal, and there is little evidence of metabolic interaction with cytochrome P450 3A4. In an early-phase study, rosuvastatin produced large and dose-related decreases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of up to 65% in hypercholesterolemic patients. Rosuvastatin should constitute an important addition to current lipid-lowering interventions.", 
    "161": "Familial hypercholesterolemia provides an excellent model for demonstrating how disease prevention can be facilitated by molecular characterization of a genetic disease. To achieve the most efficient yield in terms of patient identification and coronary heart disease prevention, family information should be obtained in the primary care setting. In the majority of cases, measurement of cholesterol levels in a patient's relatives is sufficient to determine presence or absence of familial hypercholesterolemia, and DNA testing may be used in those cases in which cholesterol level is not diagnostic. DNA testing has enabled a more refined assessment of the absolute cardiovascular risks associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, which is currently estimated to have a 50% mortality rate by age 60. Recent investigations using DNA testing have suggested that familial hypercholesterolemia is implicated in one of 12 cases of cardiovascular disease in individuals aged <65 years. Only the most potent lipid-modifying therapies should be used in those found to be affected by this disorder. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the new statin rosuvastatin (Crestor; AstraZeneca) was recently shown to produce significantly greater low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reductions and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increases than atorvastatin in a large study in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, while bringing more of these patients to LDL cholesterol goals. Familial hypercholesterolemia should serve as a paradigm of molecular medicine: we understand the genetic defect, we have the tools to identify the individuals who are at high risk of disease because they have the defect, and we have therapies that can prevent clinical disease. It nevertheless requires effort on the part of clinicians to ensure that optimal risk assessment is performed and optimal treatment provided.", 
    "162": "There is considerable evidence that more aggressive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with increased benefits in reducing atherosclerotic disease burden, supporting the notion of 'the lower, the better.' However, achievement of currently recommended goals has proven difficult with lipid-lowering agents at the commonly used doses. Current options for achieving greater LDL cholesterol reductions include use of high doses of the most effective of the available statins and use of high or moderate statin doses in combination with agents that work in a complementary manner (e.g. bile acid sequestrants or niacin). Near-term options may include statins with increased LDL cholesterol-lowering effectiveness and better-tolerated secondary agents that can be combined with statin therapy. Rosuvastatin (Crestor, AstraZeneca) is a new statin that may prove to be of considerable utility in achieving greater LDL cholesterol reductions than are currently possible with existing statins. Recent phase III clinical trials have shown that this agent produces significantly greater LDL cholesterol reductions than atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and significantly greater reductions than the maximal dose of atorvastatin in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "163": "Physicians often fail to achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals for their patients using lipid-lowering therapies in the primary care setting. A variety of factors may contribute to this failure, including inadequate effectiveness of lipid-lowering drugs in reducing LDL cholesterol at commonly used doses. In the Lipid Assessment Treatment Project (L-TAP), for example, the success rates for lipid-regulating therapies and treatments according to National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II) LDL cholesterol goals were 43% for bile acid sequestrants, 39% for niacin, 32% for gemfibrozil, 28% for psyllium fiber, 40% for statins, and 40% for combination therapy. Rosuvastatin is a new statin that has been shown to achieve significantly greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin in primary hypercholesterolemia and enabled greater proportions of patients to achieve LDL cholesterol goals. Similarly, rosuvastatin proved superior to atorvastatin in lowering LDL cholesterol in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, with more patients achieving LDL cholesterol goals. Data from these trials suggest that rosuvastatin is as safe and well tolerated as other statins. The availability of lipid-lowering drugs with greater LDL cholesterol-lowering effects could simplify the approach to coronary heart disease risk reduction in primary care.", 
    "164": "Advicor (lovastatin and extended-release niacin) is the first cholesterol-lowering combination product to become available for the management of hyperlipidemia. Lovastatin significantly lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas niacin significantly lowers triglycerides and lipoprotein (a) and markedly increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These effects are ideal for managing a variety of lipid disorders, including metabolic syndrome. Lovastatin and niacin reduce coronary heart disease mortality in primary and secondary prevention patients, respectively. The extended-release niacin component uses a unique technology to minimize adverse effects (e.g., flushing and hepatotoxicity) while retaining the same lipid-altering effects as immediate-release niacin. The combination product appears to be well tolerated, with discontinuation due to adverse effects other than flushing occurring in a similar percent of patients as for lovastatin in clinical trials. Approximately 9% of patients discontinued the combination product due to flush. No confined cases of myopathy or hepatotoxicity have been reported with this product. Once-daily dosing provides ease of administration that should improve compliance and result in a greater proportion of patients meeting their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. The nomenclature surrounding niacin products used to treat dyslipidemias is confusing. While only two types of niacin formulations exist (immediate-release formulations and formulations which dissolve more slowly than immediate-release formulations), government regulations allow for slowly dissolved niacin formulations to be divided into two types of niacin products; those that are available over-the-counter (OTC) and those that are available by prescription only. Over-the-counter slowly dissolved niacin preparations are not classified as OTC per se, but are considered \"nutritional supplements\". For this reason, they fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission and do not fall under the umbrella of the FDA branch that controls dyslipidemic products (Endocrine and Metabolic Division of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research). The slowly dissolved niacin nutritional supplements have not been reviewed by the FDA for safety nor efficacy in the treatment of dyslipidemia nor are they required to meet generic drug rules (even though various brands are available). These brands are described on their labels as \"sustained-release\", \"timed-release\", and \"slow-release\" for example. Only two slowly absorbed niacin products have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of dyslipidemia; they are Niaspan (Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Miami, FL) and Advicor (Kos Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Miami, FL). The term \"extended-release\" has been given to these two products to simplify the terminology and differentiate the products from immediate-release niacin. In this review, we will use \"extended-release\" to refer to the FDA approved slowly dissolving niacin preparation and \"sustained-release\" to refer to the nutritional supplements (not FDA approved).", 
    "165": "Coronary heart disease is the most prevalent form of cardiovascular disease in the United States. Hyperlipidemia--specifically, increased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels--positively correlates with the development of coronary heart disease. Colesevelam, a nonabsorbed, water-insoluble polymer, is a new bile acid sequestrant that is effective in lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In several short-term, placebo-controlled studies, colesevelam has decreased total cholesterol levels by approximately 6 to 10% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by approximately 9 to 20%. When given in combination with atorvastatin, lovastatin, or simvastatin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were decreased more than with colesevelam alone. Its unique hydrogel formulation may also minimize the potential for gastrointestinal adverse effects, which are common with other bile acid sequestrants. There have been few published studies available concerning this drug; no long-term studies and few large-scale studies have been published.", 
    "166": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are frequently utilized in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. With recently completed statin clinical cardiovascular outcomes data available, the purpose of this review is to analyze the relative benefits of each molecule and to determine whether \"lower is better\" is a correct hypothesis for secondary prevention. Twenty-one clinical studies, each with a duration of statin therapy of 6 months or longer, were reviewed, and the pharmacologic effects of these agents on cardiovascular outcomes was examined. As evaluated by study drug, statistical event reduction was achieved in seven of nine pravastatin studies, one of three simvastatin studies, one of six lovastatin studies, zero of two fluvastatin studies, and zero of one atorvastatin study. Pravastatin was the only statin proven statistically to reduce events in both primary and secondary prevention. Thus, all of the statins do not appear to be the same in terms of their ability to reduce cardiovascular events. Until head-to-head trials have been completed, these clinical outcomes data suggest that in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia who require high-dose statin therapy, simvastatin 80 mg each evening would appear to be the agent of choice. However, pravastatin 40 mg daily at bedtime appears to be a unique molecule, with the strongest evidence for event reduction in the majority of patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia with, or who are at risk for, coronary heart disease.", 
    "167": "A microemulsion formulation of cyclosporin (Neoral) has been developed to overcome the problems of poor and variable absorption of cyclosporin. Neoral is a potent immunosuppressive agent that is highly bound in the plasma. It has been proposed that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) delivers cyclosporin (CsA) to T-lymphocytes via the LDL receptor pathway, where it produces its therapeutic effects. Herein, we report a case of minimal change nephrotic syndrome with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated by Neoral and fluvastatin. A 65-year-old male with a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus suddenly developed nephrotic syndrome. The potential causative drugs, such as NSAIDs and antibiotics, had not been administered. The laboratory findings were as follows: proteinuria 23 g/day, serum albumin 1.9 g/dl, total cholesterol 629 mg/dl, LDL-Cho 1,930 mg/dl. Renal biopsy was normal on light microscopy, and immunofluorescence demonstrated no staining. Due to the risk of deterioration of diabetes by administering prednisolone, he was given Neoral at 2.0 mg/kg/day. He was also given fluvastatin (40 mg/day) for hyperlipidemia after the renal biopsy. At four weeks after the start of Neoral and fluvastatin, his nephrosis continued, but his LDL-Cho and total cholesterol decreased. At six weeks after treatment, proteinuria gradually reduced. At eight weeks after treatment, the proteinuria had disappeared. Nephrotic syndrome is often associated with abnormal lipid metabolism, and many patients with nephrotic syndrome show high levels of LDL-Cho. It has been reported recently that LDL apheresis is effective against nephrotic syndrome. However, in the present case, it can be speculated that the improvement of hyperlipidemia by fluvastatin probably augmented the effect of Neoral, presumably through the increased cellular uptake of Neoral. This suggests that fluvastatin may be considered as the treatment of choice for the disturbed lipoprotein profile in patients with nephrotic syndrome.",

    "169": "Elevated plasma concentration of chylomicron remnants may be causally related to atherosclerosis in obesity. We examined the effect of atorvastatin on chylomicron remnant metabolism in 25 obese men with dyslipidaemia. A remnant-like emulsion labeled with cholesteryl [(13)C]oleate was injected intravenously into patients; the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of the remnant-like emulsion was determined by measurement of (13)CO(2) in the breath and analyzed using compartmental modelling. Compared with placebo, atorvastatin significantly decreased the plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and lathosterol (P < 0.001). ApoB-48 and remnant-like particle-cholesterol (RLP-C) both decreased significantly by 23% (P = 0.002) and 33% (P = 0.045), respectively. The FCR of the remnant-like emulsion increased significantly from 0.054 +/- 0.008 to 0.090 +/- 0.010 pools/h (P = 0.002). The decrease in RLP-C was associated with the decrease in plasma triglycerides (r = 0.750, P = 0.003). Furthermore, the change in FCR of remnant-like emulsions was inversely associated with the change in LDL-C (r = -0.575, P = 0.040), suggesting removal of LDL and chylomicron remnants by similar hepatic receptor pathways. We conclude that in obese subjects, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with atorvastatin decreases the plasma concentrations of both LDL-C and triglyceride-rich remnants and that this may be partially due to an enhancement in hepatic clearance of these lipoproteins.", 
    "170": "Cadherin receptors are key morphoregulatory molecules during development. To dissect their mode of action, we developed an approach based on the use of myogenic C2 cells and beads coated with an Ncad-Fc ligand, allowing us to mimic cadherin-mediated adhesion. We used optical tweezers and video microscopy to investigate the dynamics of N-cadherin anchoring within the very first seconds of bead-cell contact. The analysis of the bead movement by single-particle tracking indicated that N-cadherin molecules were freely diffusive in the first few seconds after bead binding. The beads rapidly became diffusion-restricted and underwent an oriented rearward movement as a result of N-cadherin anchoring to the actin cytoskeleton. The kinetics of anchoring were dependent on ligand density, suggesting that it was an inducible process triggered by active cadherin recruitment. This anchoring was inhibited by the dominant negative form of Rac1, but not that of Cdc42. The Rac1 mutant had no effect on cell contact formation or cadherin-catenin complex recruitment, but did inhibit actin recruitment. Our results suggest that cadherin anchoring to the actin cytoskeleton is an adhesion-triggered, Rac1-regulated process enabling the transduction of mechanical forces across the cell membrane; they uncover novel aspects of the action of cadherins in cell sorting, cell migration, and growth cone navigation.", 
    "171": "The developments and trends of antihyperlipidemic drugs and their effects on the mortality of coronary heart disease in Japan were investigated. The developed drugs available for hyperlipidemia were recorded with their approval dates by the Ministry of Health and Welfare (Table 1). 1. Antihyperlipidemic drugs have been developed since the late 1950s. Useful drugs among them include the fibrate series and the statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) series. Clofibrate, developed in 1965, was the first fibrate drug, and pravastatin sodium (Mevalotin(R) Sankyo Co.), developed in 1989, was the first statin drug. They have sure effectiveness for lowering serum cholesterol and triglyceride. But they induce an unfavorable side-effect, rhabdomyolisis, especially after the continuous or simultaneous use of both. The other drug classes using hyperlipidemia include various different types, e.g., probucol, nicotinates, anion exchange resins, ethyl icosapentate, and dextran sodium sulfate. Despite their mild activities, the low incidence of adverse effects make them suitable for supplementary use with fibrates or statins. 2. \"Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of Hyperlipidemia in Adult\" was presented by the Japan Atherosclersis Society in 1997. The standard criteria of serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in Japanese adults were proposed. The hypercholesterolemia is the state of more than a 220 mg/dl level of serum cholesterol, and hypertriglyceridemia is of more than a 150 mg/dl level of serum triglyceride. The pharmacotherapy should be applied for a high serum level of cholesterol exceeding 240 mg/dl. But the standard routine formula of drug therapy were not indicated in the present guideline. 3. Epidemiological surveys show that hyperlipidemia induces coronary heart diseases in the United States, European countries, and Japan. The mortality of all heart disease patients in Japan increased rapidly from the late 1960s, but the mortality resulting from coronary heart disease was suppressed from 1968. This suppression continued throughout 1994 when artificial statistical changes occurred. It may be due to the newly developed antihyperlipidemic drugs, e.g., the clofibrate group, the statin series, and others (Fig.2).", 
    "172": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy given soon after disease induction uniformly prevents proteinuria in virtually all models of disease progression. This does not necessarily apply to patients with proteinuric nephropathies, who might be referred late in the course of their disease. Here we used a severe rat model of passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), which may mimic advanced phases of human membranous nephropathy, to study the response to ACE inhibitor alone or in combination with a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) that independently of the cholesterol-lowering effect influences pathways involved in inflammatory and fibrogenic processes. Therapies started when animals had massive proteinuria and renal lesions.",

Six normal rats served as controls. Animals were sacrificed at 10 months.",

Blood pressure increased during time in PHN and was normalized by treatment with ACE inhibitor and combined therapy. Even at the high dose lisinopril failed to reduce proteinuria. Simvastatin only partially affected proteinuria. However, combining lisinopril with simvastatin had a remarkable antiproteinuric effect, such that at 10 months the urinary proteins were comparable to pre-treatment values and significantly lower than either the vehicle or lisinopril groups. Hypercholesterolemia of PHN rats was limited by combined therapy, and a positive correlation was found between serum cholesterol and proteinuria. Renal function was only partially ameliorated by simvastatin but significantly improved by combined therapy. Drug combination significantly limited glomerulosclerosis, tubular damage and interstitial inflammation, compared to vehicle or drugs alone. Up-regulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA in PHN kidneys was not affected by lisinopril, it was inhibited by 30% after simvastatin, and almost completely normalized by lisinopril plus simvastatin.",

In 1992, the estimated incidence of lipid lowering drug use was 251(95% CI: 226, 277)/100,000 person years in women and 251(95% CI: 225, 276)/100,000 person years in men. The largest incidence estimates were observed in 1996 (685(95% CI: 644, 726)/100,000 person years in women and 881(95% CI: 834, 928)/100,000 person years in men). After 1996, incidence stabilized in 1997 and decreased in 1998 to 599(561, 637)/100,000 person years in women and 731(688, 773)/100,000 person years in men. Most of the patients (approximately 95%) were treated with one lipid lowering agent. Statins were used by over 90% of patients from 1996 onwards. In 1998, 35% of the patients started with a statin that was not a first choice drug (mainly atorvastatin).", 
    "179": "In the period from 1991-98, prevalence of lipid lowering drug use significantly increased in The Netherlands. However, incidence stabilized and decreased after 1996 which may be explained by the fact that the number of patients eligible for treatment was reached. The question remains whether lipid lowering medication was targeted to the appropriate patients."
