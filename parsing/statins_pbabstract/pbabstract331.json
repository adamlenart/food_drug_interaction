    "0": "Despite dramatic improvement in treatments for reducing risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), it is still the leading cause of mortality in the developed world. In the past decade, a major improvement in reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol has been achieved with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins). This approach has been shown to be beneficial in both primary and secondary prevention of CHD. On the other hand, while a reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is an independent CHD risk factor, no HDL cholesterol goal has yet been established. The Helsinki Heart Study and the Veterans Affairs High-density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial documented that increasing HDL cholesterol with gemfibrozil significantly decreases coronary events or stroke in CHD patients either with elevated non-HDL cholesterol or normal LDL cholesterol levels plus low HDL cholesterol. Investigations with statins have focused on their efficacy not only in significantly decreasing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels but also in increasing HDL cholesterol concentrations. The two different classes of drugs (statins and fibrates) have different effects on the various HDL subspecies. As new members of these drug classes and other novel drugs are emerging, there is interest in clarifying whether HDL is only a bystander (an indicator for other CHD risk factors) or it has an active role in the development of CHD. If HDL has an active role, there is a need to determine if any HDL subspecies are protective. It is now clear that HDL plays a pivotal role in cellular cholesterol efflux via the interaction of apolipoprotein A-I with the ATP binding cassette transporter A-1. Thereafter the cholesterol is esterified by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase; HDL is remodeled by cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and hepatic lipase. The cholesterol in HDL can either be transferred to apolipoprotein B-containing particles via CETP or delivered directly to the liver with the help of scavenger receptor B1.", 
    "1": "Populations of patients at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) include those with type 2 diabetes and those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). Despite benefits of statin lipid-lowering therapy in reducing CHD risk in diabetic patients, screening for dyslipidemia in such patients is inadequate, and patients frequently fail to achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein goals. Diagnosis of HeFH is also suboptimal, despite the reliability of family lipid screening in confirming clinical diagnosis and utility of screening in identifying other family members who are at risk. Patients with HeFH frequently require large reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to achieve target levels. In both of these populations, statins that produce large reductions in LDL cholesterol offer advantages in achieving lipid-lowering goals and in simplifying medical therapy to reduce CHD risk.", 
    "2": "The major therapeutic action of statin drugs is reduction in levels of circulating atherogenic lipoproteins as a result of inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase mainly in the liver. The magnitude of reduction of atherogenic lipoproteins differs among various statins. It is suggested that an ideal statin would maximize the pharmacodynamic activity in the liver and minimize the inhibitory activity outside the liver, particularly in some vulnerable tissues, such as skeletal muscle. An additional advantage would be a low risk of undesirable interactions with other drugs. Compared with other statins, rosuvastatin has been found to be a relatively potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and to have a high degree of selectivity for effect in liver cells compared with a range of non-hepatic cells, including cultured human skeletal muscle cells. In addition, rosuvastatin undergoes relatively little metabolism by the hepatic CYP system; it has a moderate degree of systemic bioavailability and a relatively long elimination half-life. On the basis of these criteria, rosuvastatin represents a step forward in efforts to optimize the pharmacologic properties of the statin class.", 
    "3": "Statins act by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and thereby reducing cholesterol synthesis. In X-ray crystallographic studies, we have determined the structures of the catalytic portions of the enzyme in complex with statin molecules. These studies show that the HMG-like moiety of statin molecules occupy the HMG binding site of the enzyme, with the hydrophobic groups of the statins occupying a binding site exposed by movement of flexible helices in the enzyme catalytic domain. In addition to bonds formed by the HMG-like moiety, statins exhibit different types and numbers of binding interactions in association with structural differences. Type 1 statins (e.g., simvastatin) exhibit binding via a decalin ring structure, and type 2 statins (e.g., rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin) exhibit additional binding via their fluorophenyl group. Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin exhibit hydrogen bonds absent from other type 2 statins; rosuvastatin exhibits a unique bond via its electronegative sulfone group. Differences in statin structure and binding characteristics may partially contribute to differences in potency of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition and other pharmacologic properties.", 
    "4": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors called statins, have besides their cholesterol-lowering function, therapeutic value in conditions such as neo-angiogenesis and atherosclerosis.

Synthesis of collagens type I, III, IV and fibronectin was quantified by ELISA. Additionally, we examined the influence of simvastatin on isoprenylation of Ras and RhoA proteins.", 
    "6": "Lovastatin and simvastatin induced a dose-dependent inhibition of the proliferation rate of HSC. Subsequent addition of PDGF and/or mevalonate, after long-term exposure of simvastatin to HSC, did not reverse simvastatins' antiproliferative effect. Lovastatin and simvastatin reduced the protein steady state level of collagens type I (-40%), III (-45%) and IV (-27%). Membrane bound Ras steady state levels decreased under the influence of simvastatin. Membrane bound RhoA remained unaltered, whereas, cytosolic RhoA protein level was strongly reduced.",

The primary efficacy endpoint was percent reduction in LDL-C from baseline to study endpoint for ezetimibe 10 mg plus pravastatin (pooled doses) compared to pravastatin alone (pooled doses) and ezetimibe alone. The combined use of ezetimibe and pravastatin resulted in significant incremental reductions in LDL-C and TG compared to pooled pravastatin alone (p<0.01). Coadministration therapy reduced LDL-C by 34-41%, TG by 21-23%, and increased HDL-C by 7.8-8.4%, depending on the dose of pravastatin. The combined regimen was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to pravastatin alone and placebo.",

The mean follow-up was 73 +/- 19 months. Mortality rate was 13%, and 20 patients (12%) had major cardiac event, 8 patients (5%) had stroke and 10 patients (6%) underwent revascularization. Multivariate analysis matched for age and ejection factor showed that moderate disease (stenosis 40-59%) (OR = 2.713, p < 0.024) was an independent predictive factor of major cardiac event.", 
    "12": "Recent studies demonstrate that statin therapy decreases plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a potent risk factor for thrombotic vascular events. CRP is an acute phase reactant, and most circulating CRP is synthesized by hepatocytes in response to IL-6. Since statins do not appear to have a consistent impact on serum levels of IL-6, their impact on plasma CRP very likely reflects down-regulation of hepatocyte responsiveness to this cytokine. The ability of IL-6 to promote transcription of CRP is mediated, in large part, by activation of the transcription factor STAT3; this activation requires both a tyrosine phosphorylation (mediated by the IL-6 receptor complex) and a serine phosphorylation (Ser-727), the origin of which has been more obscure. There is new evidence that, when hepatocytes are exposed to IL-6, the consequent serine phosphorylation of STATS is mediated by a signal transduction pathway in which the G-protein Rac-1 plays an obligate role. Inasmuch as the proper function of Rac-1 is contingent on isoprenylation that anchors it to the plasma membrane, it is reasonable to hypothesize that statin therapy interferes with IL-6 signaling in hepatocytes by suppressing the isoprenylation of Rac-1; a decrease in the transcription of CRP would be a likely consequence of this effect. Whether or not a reduction in elevated CRP is directly beneficial to vascular health, statins can exert direct effects on vascular endothelial function that should help prevent vascular inflammation and thrombosis, and thus should be of particular benefit to subjects - such as those with high CRP levels - who are at high risk for vascular events.", 
    "13": "Atherosclerosis is a form of arterial disease that manifests in the coronary circulation as coronary artery disease (CAD), in the carotid arteries as cerebrovascular disease, and in the aorta and lower extremity arteries as peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The systemic nature of the disease is reflected in the fact that individuals with PAD or carotid artery disease are more likely to have CAD than those without. Since individuals with PAD are at markedly increased risk of cardiovascular ischemic events, early identification of this population and more aggressive medical interventions could substantially improve both morbidity and survival. The incidence of PAD in the general population is high, and currently affects 8-10 million Americans. The risk of developing PAD is predicted by both age and common atherosclerosis risk factors (e.g., smoking and diabetes). Efficient office-based PAD detection depends on the application of objective techniques to establish this diagnosis. Objective noninvasive tests, such as measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI), are known to be more sensitive than traditional clinical assessments. Since the major threat to patients with PAD is from secondary cardiovascular ischemic events, a primary therapeutic goal is to modify atherosclerotic risk factors. While national recommendations mandate aggressive lowering of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels as a primary treatment goal in all patients with overt atherosclerosis, as 'coronary heart disease risk equivalent' syndromes, individuals with PAD are less intensively treated than those with CAD. Statins are the most effective of current treatments in lowering LDL-C, and have proven efficacy in secondary prevention among patients with established CAD. The use of statin medications in high-risk groups such as PAD patients could prove particularly beneficial in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and therefore merits prospective clinical investigation.", 
    "14": "From March to July 1999, 940 private cardiologists in France recruited 100,429 patients of whom 30,430 (30%) had a previous history of atherothrombotic disease. The prevalence of patients with a previous history of Myocardial Infarction (MI), Ischemic Stroke (IS) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) was 19.7%, 7.2% and 10.7% respectively. Among patients with a history of atherothrombotic disease, myocardial infarction was the most frequent diagnosis responsible for 65% of all consultations. Each cardiologist described the secondary prevention treatment for 3 consecutive patients among whom 1 corresponded to each of the 3 atherothrombotic territories. The most frequent cardiovascular risk factors were hypercholesterolemia for myocardial infarction (77.9%), smoking for PAD (32.5%) and hypertension for IS (73.2%). Diabetes mellitus (1/4 patients), obesity (1/3) and sedentary way of life (1/3) were equally prevalent for each of the atherothrombotic territories. More than 90% of the patients received an antithrombotic drug. Antiplatelet agents were largely prescribed, anticoagulants being more frequently used for patients with atrial fibrillation, symptomatic cardiac heart failure or stroke of embolic origin. Thienopyridines represent 17.9% of the prescriptions. The prescription rate of statins after MI (58.9%) is lower than in published studies in secondary prevention. The lack of lipid measurement and the delay since last measurement are non-prescription factors. The rates of prescription are even lower in case of PAD (44.6%) or IS history (33.3%). More than half of the patients (56.6%) are treated with beta-blockers and 40.1% with ACE inhibitors. These rates are similar to what has been published. Atherothrombotic disease represents a large part of the daily activity of private cardiologists and is not limited to coronary heart disease. Despite their proven efficacy, drugs for secondary prevention for MI, except antithrombotic drugs, are insufficiently prescribed. This under-prescription is even higher in patients with PAD or IS history and may be related to the lack of clinical trials in these specific territories.", 
    "15": "The use of cardiovascular secondary prevention medications in patients with acute coronary syndromes was compared in 4 sequential observational surveys carried out in France from 1995 to 2000. The Usik 1995 and Usic 2000 surveys included patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction, while the 2 Prevenir surveys (1998 and 1999) assessed the medications prescribed in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Antiplatelet agents were prescribed in 91% of the patients in 1995, 93% in 1998 and 1999 and 96% in 2000; for beta-blockers, the respective figures were: 64%, 68%, 75% and 76%. For ACE-Inhibitors, the figures were: 46%, 41%, 41% and 50%. For statins, the prescription increased from 10% to 36%, 59% and 64%. In 1995, 8% of the patients received both antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers and statins (4% of them also had an ACE-Inhibitor); in 2000, the respective figures were 53% and 27%.

Itraconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and the transport protein P-glycoprotein, is known to interact with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The current trials aimed to examine in vivo the effect of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin.", 
    "17": "Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover trials were performed. Healthy male volunteers (trial A, n = 12; trial B, n = 14) received itraconazole, 200 mg, or placebo once daily for 5 days; on day 4, 10 mg (trial A) or 80 mg (trial B) of rosuvastatin was coadministered. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, rosuvastatin-lactone (trial A only), and active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 hours after dosing.", 
    "18": "After coadministration with itraconazole, the rosuvastatin geometric least-square mean for the treatment ratio was increased by 39% for AUC(0-ct) (area under the rosuvastatin plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last common time at which quantifiable concentrations were obtained for both treatments within a volunteer in trial A) and by 28% for AUC(0-t) (area under the rosuvastatin plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration in trial B), with the treatment ratio for maximum observed plasma drug concentration increased by 36% in trial A and 15% in trial B compared with placebo. For trial A (but not for trial B), the upper boundary of the 90% confidence interval for the treatment ratios fell outside the preset limits (0.7-1.43). The 95% confidence intervals for all treatment ratios (except maximum observed plasma drug concentration in trial B) did not include 1. These results indicate that itraconazole produces a modest increase in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin accounted for the majority of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (> or =87%) and most of the total inhibitors (> or =75%).",

    "20": "The observation that almost half of all myocardial infarctions and strokes occur in persons without elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol has prompted the study of factors other than hyperlipidemia that contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation plays a substantial role in plaque progression and rupture. Research interest has increasingly focused on biomarkers of inflammation as a means of predicting more accurately which patients are at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Clinical studies indicate that C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, independently predicts cardiovascular risk in healthy persons as well as in persons with established CVD and those with acute ischemia. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been shown to reduce levels of CRP through mechanisms independent of their effects on lipid levels. Initial clinical studies also suggest that CRP levels may have utility in the targeting of statin therapy, particularly in primary prevention. These results need direct testing in large, prospective clinical trials to determine whether statin therapy will benefit persons without overt hyperlipidemia but with evidence of systemic inflammation. Confirmation of these preliminary findings, if incorporated into evidence-based guidelines, may profoundly change the approach to diagnosis and treatment of CVD.", 
    "21": "Considerable effort has been devoted to improving the pharmacologic characteristics and clinical effects of statins. Desirable pharmacologic properties include potent inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, selectivity of uptake in hepatocytes, low systemic bioavailability to reduce systemic adverse effects, prolonged elimination half-life, and no or minimal hepatic metabolism to avoid drug-drug interactions. The desirable effects on lipid variables would include increased effectiveness in reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and other atherogenic lipoproteins and measurable beneficial effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. As a product of the ongoing efforts regarding statin pharmacology, the new statin rosuvastatin exhibits significant improvements in several of these characteristics.", 
    "22": "A large body of evidence has demonstrated that reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decrease the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and related adverse events. The greatest reductions in morbidity and mortality are attained in higher-risk patients, suggesting that targeting this group can maximize the cost-effectiveness of statins, since fewer patients need to be treated to prevent one event. High-risk individuals (those with preexisting CHD or CHD risk equivalents) require aggressive lipid lowering to achieve the stringent LDL-C goal levels established by the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP III). The hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have assumed the central role in this setting because of their superior ability to reduce LDL-C across the spectrum of CHD risk. Rosuvastatin, a new agent in this class, reduces LDL-C to a significantly greater degree than atorvastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin. The more aggressive goals put forward since ATP I (1987) have heightened interest in more efficacious statins. As a result, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and now rosuvastatin have been developed, adding sequentially greater LDL-C-reducing capacity for the physician. Substantially more patients, particularly high-risk patients, are thereby able to achieve NCEP ATP III target LDL-C levels with rosuvastatin. Other cholesterol-lowering drugs (bile acid sequestrants, niacin, plant stanols, and fibrates) are much less effective at lowering LDL-C and are much less well tolerated but may be useful when combined with statins. A novel class of agents, cholesterol transport inhibitors, have recently become available. These and other new agents hold promise to help achieve ATP III goals when used in combination regimens initiated with a statin.", 
    "23": "The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk contain a number of features that distinguish them from the previous ATP guidelines. These new features include modifications in lipid/lipoprotein levels considered optimal, abnormal, or reflective of risk; increased focus on primary prevention through use of Framingham risk scoring to define risk in persons with multiple lipid/nonlipid risk factors; and increased focus on the association of the metabolic syndrome with CHD risk. The introduction of the category of CHD risk equivalents-including persons with atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, or 10-year CHD risk > 20% based on Framingham scoring-results in an increase over previous guidelines in the proportion of patients categorized as being at high risk and therefore eligible for more intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapy. Use of the new secondary therapeutic target of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol should improve management of lipid risk factors in patients who have elevated triglyceride levels after LDL-C goals have been met. These new features of the NCEP ATP III guidelines should improve identification and treatment of patients with dyslipidemias associated with CHD risk.", 
    "24": "Several major clinical studies have examined the impact of lipid lowering in patients with and without coronary heart disease and have demonstrated that lowering lipid levels can successfully and significantly delay the onset of cardiovascular events. Although epidemiologic studies and small clinical trials have suggested that more aggressive and sustained lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) can result in reductions in cardiovascular events in these populations, reducing LDL-C to these concentrations has only recently been shown in larger clinical trials. However, few clinical trials have been conducted in patients with certain special high risks, such as those who have had a recent revascularization procedure or have experienced an acute coronary event. Three trials examined the short- and long-term clinical benefits of aggressive lipid lowering in patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery (Post-CABG), were candidates for angioplasty (AVERT), or were hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes (MIRACL).", 
    "25": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, are a well-tolerated, effective class of medications for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol levels. Extensive data from clinical trials demonstrate that these agents reduce fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention patients, including women and the elderly. A threshold value for LDL-C reduction below which there is no further clinical benefit has not yet been identified. In the Heart Protection Study (HPS), significant relative risk reduction occurred even among patients with LDL-C levels < 2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl). Statin therapy also produced reductions in cardiovascular disease in a wide range of high-risk patients regardless of baseline cholesterol levels. Rhabdomyolysis, typically defined as muscle pain or weakness associated with creatine kinase levels higher than 10 times the upper limit of normal and the presence of myoglobulinuria, is a rare but potentially serious complication of statins. Although dose-dependent transaminase elevations occur in 0.5 to 2% of cases, it has not been determined whether these elevations qualify as true drug-related hepatotoxicity. Management of myopathy and elevated transaminases is addressed in a joint publication from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Because statins have significant potential benefits and a low risk for serious adverse effects, aggressive therapy should be considered in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease.",

Expression of class II proteins on renal microvascular endothelial cells (RMEC) makes it available to circulating lymphocytes and imparts a surveillance capacity to RMEC for controlling inflammatory responses. In this report, the co-expression of HLA-DR and the endothelial marker CD31 are used to identify RMEC as a distinct population of cells within a standard renal biopsy using flow cytometry. A three-laser, multicolor flow cytometry analysis using Alexa dyes, developed for characterizing the expression of cell surface antigens, identifies RMEC as a population separate from HLA-DR-expressing leukocytes. HLA-DR RMEC co-express HLA-DP and HLA-DQ. RMEC also express the T cell costimulatory factor CD58 but not CD80, CD86, or CD40. On the basis of high HLA-DR expression, RMEC are isolated for culture using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and magnetic beads. Cultured RMEC require normal basal physiologic concentrations of gamma interferon (gammaIFN) to maintain HLA protein expression. This expression is regulated by CIITA, the MHC class II-specific transcription factor. Four tissue-specific promoters have been described for CIITA. In freshly isolated RMEC, RT-PCR and hybridization using specific oligonucleotide probes to CIITA promoter sequences identify only the statin-sensitive gammaIFN-induced promoter IV of CIITA. Therefore, the constitutive expression of HLA-DR on RMEC in normal human kidney is located in a position for immune surveillance, depends on basal physiologic concentrations of gammaIFN, and may be amenable to regulation with statins.", 
    "27": "The statin treatment of dyslipidemia is associated with a reduced risk of development of Alzheimer disease (AD). The effect may be mediated by a reduction in cholesterol biosynthesis in the brain, by lowering levels of apolipoprotein E (apo E)-containing lipoproteins, or by pleitropic effects such as reduction in beta-amyloid production. In the brain, cholesterol from damaged or dying neurons is converted to 24S-hydroxycholesterol by cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46). The oxysterol is subsequently transferred across the blood-brain barrier, transported to the liver by low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), and excreted as bile acids. Most of plasma 24S-hydroxycholesterol is derived from brain cholesterol; consequently, plasma levels of the oxysterol reflect brain cholesterol catabolism.",

    "32": "Proteoheparan sulfate can be adsorbed to a methylated silica surface in a monomolecular layer via its transmembrane hydrophobic protein core domain. Due to electrostatic repulsion, its anionic glycosaminoglycan side chains are stretched out into the blood substitute solution, thereby representing a receptor site for specific lipoprotein binding through basic amino acid-rich residues within their apolipoproteins. The binding process was studied by ellipsometric techniques. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was found to deposit strongly at the proteoheparan sulfate-coated surface, particularly in the presence of Ca(2+), apparently through complex formation 'proteoglycan-LDL-calcium'. This ternary complex build-up may be interpreted as arteriosclerotic nanoplaque formation on the molecular level responsible for the arteriosclerotic primary lesion. HDL bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycan protected against LDL deposition and completely suppressed calcification of the proteoglycan-lipoprotein complex. In addition, HDL was able to decelerate the ternary complex deposition and to disrupt newly formed nanoplaques. Therefore, HDL attached to its proteoglycan receptor sites is thought to raise a multidomain barrier, selection and control motif for transmembrane and paracellular lipoprotein uptake into the arterial wall. The molecular arteriosclerosis model was tested on its reliability in a biosensor application in order to unveil possible acute pleiotropic effects of the lipid lowering drug fluvastatin. The very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)/intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)/LDL and VLDL/IDL/LDL/HDL plasma fractions from a high-risk patient with dyslipoproteinemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus showed beginning arteriosclerotic nanoplaque formation already at a normal blood Ca(2+) concentration, with a strong increase at higher Ca(2+) concentrations. Nanoplaque formation and size of the HDL-containing lipid fraction remained well below that of the LDL-containing lipid fraction. Fluvastatin, whether applied acutely to the patient (one single 80 mg slow release matrix tablet) or in a 2-months medication regimen, markedly slowed down this process of ternary aggregational nanoplaque build-up and substantially inhibited nanoplaque size development at all Ca(2+) concentrations used. The acute action resulted without any significant change in lipid concentrations of the patient. Furthermore, after nanoplaque generation, fluvastatin, similar to HDL, was able to reduce nanoplaque formation and size. These immediate effects of fluvastatin have to be taken into consideration while interpreting the clinical outcome of long-term studies.",

FH is caused by small mutations or larger rearrangements in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Here, we report that screening the LDLR gene in a Swiss family (n = 15) with clinical symptoms of FH by combined single strand conformation polymorphism and long-distance PCR identified a novel 1.3 kb deletion in the LDLR. The deletion eliminated exon 4 of the LDLR presumably by recombination between two identical 25 bp repeats present in intron 3 and 4. The 25 bp sequence in intron 3 is part of an Alu repeat, whereas no homology to Alu repeats was found for the intron 4 region. This 1.3 kb LDLR deletion allele cosegregated with elevated cholesterol levels over three generations. Even on high-dose statin therapy, carriers of the deletion averaged 1.6 times higher cholesterol levels and 1.9 times higher apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) levels than non-carriers who had lipid and apoB-100 levels within the range of the Swiss population. Most affected members of the first and second generation of this family had experienced a first myocardial infarction (MI) before the age of 55 years and most LDLR gene deletion carriers older than 40 years showed severe coronary artery disease (CAD). Hence, we conclude that deletion of exon 4 in the LDLR gene drastically decreases low-density lipoprotein binding leading to severe hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "37": "The triglyceride (TG)-lowering effect of pitavastatin (CAS 147526-32-7), a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was investigated in a guinea pig model of post-prandial lipemia. Plasma TG levels started to rise 2 h after the fat load, reached the maximum at 8 h and then gradually decreased. A 14-day dose of pitavastatin at 3 mg/kg decreased the 8 h plasma TG levels by 59%, and the 0-12 h area under the curve (AUC) of TG levels above the initial levels, by 77%. This effect was also shown with 30 mg/kg of atorvastatin (CAS 134523-00-5), and the same dose of simvastatin (CAS 79902-63-9). The intensity of the action was equivalent for pitavastatin and atorvastatin, but weaker with simvastatin. In order to clarify the mechanism of this action, the effect of pitavastatin exerted on the activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), which participates in the secretion to the lymph vessel of chyromicron (CM)-TG in the small intestine, and the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), which is the hydrolysis enzyme of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG and CM-TG, was examined. However, an influence on the activity of MTP or LPL by pitavastatin was not shown. These results suggested that pitavastatin lowered the postprandial TG levels in guinea pigs by accelerating the remnant clearance, probably through the enhancement of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. This effect is expected to improve postprandial lipemia.", 
    "38": "To gain a better understanding of drug-drug interaction between various medicinal substances and statins, in vitro experiments using human hepatic microsomes were performed. The metabolic clearance of atorvastatin (CAS 134523-00-5) was about 32 microliters/min/mg protein, some 15-fold greater than that of pitavastatin (CAS 147526-32-7). On co-incubation with several medicinal substances, metabolic inhibition of pitavastatin was negligible in human hepatic microsomes. However, a remarkable metabolic inhibition of atorvastatin was noted in the presence of various medicinal substances. The intrinsic clearance of atorvastatin lactone was 20-fold greater than that of its acid form, whereas no marked difference was noted between pitavastatin and its lactone form. Pitavastatin lactone showed no inhibitory effect on CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of testosterone in contrast to atorvastatin lactone. These results suggest that pitavastatin and its lactone form will be highly unlikely to interact with other drugs in clinical practice.",

There was no evidence that the risk increased with higher doses or longer duration of statin use, or that the risk varied by individual statin. There was no evidence that the risk of cataract was increased by concurrent use of statins and drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 system.",

No significant difference was found between the two groups when considering preoperative NYHA functional class and left ventricular function. In-hospital mortality was significant higher in MVR than in MRr patients (6.4% versus 0%; p <0.01). QoL was significantly impaired in patients with MVR in physical function (PF), role function (RF) and general health (GH) compared with patients undergoing MRr. Nevertheless, only slight impairments in two of eight aspects in MVR, and in one of eight aspects in MRr, were found compared with an age- and sex-matched standard population. Mid-term survival was similar in both groups.",

Erythromycin is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 that markedly increases circulating levels of some other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "51": "In this randomised, double-blind, two-way cross-over, placebo-controlled trial 14 healthy volunteers were given 500 mg erythromycin or placebo four times daily for 7 days. A single dose of 80 mg rosuvastatin was co-administered on day 4 of dosing. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin and active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were measured up to 96 h after dosing.", 
    "52": "Eleven volunteers had data available from both dosing periods. There was no increase in rosuvastatin plasma exposure following co-administration with erythromycin compared to placebo. In fact, following co-administration with erythromycin, rosuvastatin geometric least square mean AUC((0-t)) and C(max) were 20% and 31%, respectively, lower than with placebo. Individual treatment ratios for AUC((0-t)) ranged from 0.48 to 1.17, and for C(max) ranged from 0.33 to 2.19. Essentially all of the circulating active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and most (>94%) of the total inhibitors were accounted for by rosuvastatin. Erythromycin did not affect the proportion of circulating active or total inhibitors accounted for by circulating rosuvastatin.", 
    "53": "Erythromycin did not produce any increase in rosuvastatin plasma exposure. This indicates that CYP3A4 metabolism is not an important clearance mechanism for rosuvastatin, a result consistent with previous findings. The small decreases in rosuvastatin AUC((0-t)) and C(max) that occurred as a consequence of short-term treatment with erythromycin are unlikely to have relevance to long-term treatment with rosuvastatin.", 
    "54": "Anabolic agents represent an important new advance in the therapy of osteoporosis. Their potential might be substantially greater than the anti-resorptives. Because the anti-resorptives and anabolic agents work by completely distinct mechanisms of action, it is possible that the combination of agents could be significantly more potent than either agent alone. Recent evidence suggests that a plateau in BMD might occur after prolonged exposure to PTH. Anti-resorptive therapy during or after anabolic therapy might prevent this skeletal adaptation. Protocols to consider anabolic agents as intermittent recycling therapy would be of interest. Of all the anabolics, PTH is the most promising. However, there are unanswered questions about PTH. More studies are needed to document an anabolic effect on cortical bone. More large-scale studies are needed to further determine the reduction in nonvertebral fractures with PTH, especially at the hip. In the future, PTH is likely to be modified for easier and more targeted delivery. Oral or transdermal delivery systems may become available. Recently, Gowen et al have described an oral calcilytic molecule that antagonizes the parathyroid cell calcium receptor, thus stimulating the endogenous release of PTH. This approach could represent a novel endogenous delivery system for intermittent PTH administration. Rising expectations that anabolic therapies for osteoporosis will soon play a major role in treating this disease are likely to fuel further studies and the development of even more novel approaches to therapy.", 
    "55": "Deregulation of any of the steps in cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis may result in its malignant transformation. Statins, along with their lipid-lowering potential, modify several processes in the cell cycle. These agents inhibit cell proliferation and arrest cell cycle progression by interrupting growth-promoting signals. Statins selectively induce proapoptotic protential in tumor cells and synergistically enhance proapoptotic potential of several cytotoxic agents. Statins alter angiogenic potential of cells by modulating apoptosis inhibitory effects of VEGF and decrease secretion of metalloproteases. Statins also alter adhesion and migration of tumor cells, thereby inhibiting tumor invasion and metastasis. Statins suppress rate of activation of multiple coagulation factors and thus prevent coagulation-mediated angiogenesis. Statins have been shown to have anti-tumor activity in experimental models. Various anti-neoplastic properties of statins are probably a result of inhibition of posttranslational modifications of growth regulatory proteins. Molecular mechanisms of antiproliferative, proapoptotic and antiangiogenic effects of statins are reviewed in this chapter.", 
    "56": "Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) belongs to the integrin family and plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T-cell activation. Random screening of chemical libraries identified the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin as an inhibitor of the LFA-1/intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 interaction. The effect of lovastatin on LFA-1 was found to be unrelated to the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and to be mediated by lovastatin binding to a novel allosteric site within LFA-1. The biological relevance of LFA-1 inhibition by statins with respect to the overall benefit of this drug class is reviewed. The implications of the statin effect on LFA-1 for future drug design and therapy are discussed.", 
    "57": "Activation of the coagulation pathway and the inhibition of the fibrinolytic pathway play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of thrombotic vascular disease such as acute coronary syndromes. Statins have been proved to be effective in patients with acute coronary syndromes in terms of reduction of cardiovascular events. It is assumed that the direct effects on vascular cells, which are independent of lipid-lowering, particularly the alterations in coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways, may contribute to these benefits. Indeed, in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells as well as in monocytes/macrophages, stains reduce tissue factor and plasminogen activator-1 expression and activity and increase tissue plasminogen activator expression and activity. These effects are mainly mediated by the inhibition of the Rho pathway, whereas the activation of Akt by statins plays a role in the suppression of tissue factor expression. These effects on coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways may be particularly important in patients with acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "58": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are successfully used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and profoundly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypercholesterolemic patients. Endothelial dysfunction is the early state of atherosclerosis and predicts adverse cardiac events and mortality. Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity in the vascular wall, caused by increased free oxygen-radical generation and decreased NO production, seems to be an important underlying mechanism. It is well established that statins improve endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemic patients. However, results from in vitro studies, animal experiments, and small clinical trials suggest that statins may improve vascular function after short-term treatment in hyper- and normocholesterolemic individuals. The underlying mechanisms may at least in part be related to the cholesterol-independent effects of statins on vascular cells. Cellular antioxidative properties of statins, leading to decreased oxidative stress and restoration of NO bioactivity, may be of special relevance for the improvement of vascular function. However, further studies and clinical intervention trials are required to clarify the clinical importance of the pleiotropic effects in humans and their contribution to the well-established clinical benefits of statins and to confirm a beneficial effect of statin therapy on endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular events in normocholesterolemic patients.", 
    "59": "Endothelial dysfunction is recognized as an early event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Many risk factors cause endothelial dysfunction, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus. The precise steps leading to endothelial dysfunction are still being elucidated. Increasing evidence indicates that oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (ox-LDL) plays an important role in endothelial dysfunction. Ox-LDL induces endothelial injury; inhibits apoptosis, monocyte adhesion, and platelet aggregation; and inhibits endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression/activity, all of which contribute to atherosclerotic process. Several pharmacologic agents, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), have been shown to provide endothelial stabilization through mechanisms that go beyond their primary therapeutic effect. Alteration in the endothelial function might result from increase in eNOS activity, reduction in the production of free radicals, inhibition of ox-LDL action, or other undefined mechanisms. This review will focus on the protective role and some of the mechanisms of statins in ox-LDL-induced endothelial dysfunction.",

    "64": "Statins reduce cholesterol levels through competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the key enzyme that regulates cholesterol synthesis. The cholesterol-lowering effect of statins is also due to an increase in the uptake of cholesterol by cells as a result of intracellular cholesterol depletion and enhanced expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. The use of statins as lipid-lowering agents has lead to remarkable changes in the treatment and prevention of ischemic heart disease. Results of large clinical trials of patients with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated that statins reduce inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, an independent risk factor in the disease. Statins exhibit properties that are beyond their lipid-lowering effects. These non-lipid-lowering properties involve the inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway through decreased synthesis of many nonsteroidal isoprenoid compounds. The focus on the immunomodulatory effect of statins is the result of the positive outcome of pravastatin treatment in cardiac transplantation patients, as well as angiographic regression studies showing insignificant changes in the degree of coronary stenosis despite a large reduction in cardiac events. Statin treatment reduces the risk of ischemic stroke despite the fact that LDL cholesterol is not directly associated with the risk of stroke. This observation lead to the investigation of the role of statins in inflammation and the immune system. Recent research data demonstrated that statins inhibit the induction of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class II expression by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), leading to repression of MHC II-mediated T-cell activation. Furthermore, statins inhibit the expression of specific cell surface receptors on monocytes, adhesion molecules and also integrin-dependent leucocyte adhesion. While statins may stimulate the secretion of caspase-1, IL-1beta and IL-18 in peripheral mononuclear cells in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, they exhibit additional effects on inflammation by decreasing IL-6 synthesis in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro. The focus of this monograph is to highlight the role of statins in the modulation of the immune system and inflammatory processes.",

    "66": "Osteoporosis affects a large number of people in industrialised countries. It has clinical and public-health impacts, most importantly due to subsequent fractures. Osteoporotic fractures are one of the most common causes of disability and are associated with enormous healthcare expenditure. The majority of existing treatment options for osteoporosis only inhibit bone resorption and prevent excessive bone loss but are not capable of stimulating bone formation. However, several recent in vitro and in vivo studies in animals demonstrated that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors stimulate the production of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2), which is a potent regulating protein in osteoblast differentiation and activity. This suggests that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may have an anabolic effect on bones, making them a potentially interesting treatment option for osteoporosis. Additionally, several studies in humans showed that some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may have a beneficial effect on bone turnover and may lead to an increase in bone mineral density. Consequently, several observational studies tried to evaluate whether use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is associated with a decreased risk of fractures. Even though not all results of these epidemiological studies, using different designs in different study populations, were entirely consistent, they provided substantial evidence that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor use may decrease the bone fracture risk by approximately 50%. On the other hand, reanalysis of two randomised controlled trials of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy, designed to assess cardiovascular outcomes, could not show that patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors had a lower fracture risk in comparison with placebo-treated patients. Therefore, to conclusively assess the potential of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, randomised controlled trials need to be performed to address this conflicting issue. Until the results of such trials are available, practitioners should prescribe the drugs that have been proven to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures.",

    "80": "Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a key role in pancreatic fibrosis, a constant feature of chronic pancreatitis. PSC activation occurs in response to profibrogenic mediators such as cytokines and involves proliferation, transition towards a myofibroblastic phenotype and enhanced production of extracellular matrix proteins. Previously, we have shown that PSC activation correlates with the activity of the Ras-Raf-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signalling cascade [Gut 51 (2002) 579]. Using a rat culture model of PSCs, we have now evaluated the effects of lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor that interferes with protein isoprenylation, on PSC viability and activation as well as on signalling through Ras proteins. Apoptotic cells were detected applying the TUNEL assay. Proliferation of PSCs was quantitated using the bromodeoxyuridine DNA incorporation assay. Expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (an indicator of the myofibroblastic phenotype), ERK activation and membrane translocation of the Ras superfamily member RhoA were analysed by immunoblotting. Lovastatin inhibited serum- and platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated PSC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. At drug concentrations above the level required for growth inhibition, a strong increase of apoptotic cells was observed. Furthermore, lovastatin inhibited induction of alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in the course of primary culture. Immunoblot experiments indicated that lovastatin suppressed both Ras-mediated ERK 1/2 activation and platelet-derived growth factor-induced membrane translocation of RhoA. Together, our data suggest that lovastatin, through the interruption of Ras signalling, interferes with PSC activation. The antifibrotic efficiency of statins should be tested in animal models of chronic pancreatitis.", 
    "81": "The risk of cardiovascular complications is markedly increased in patients on dialysis treatment. This includes cardiac disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. The mortality in dialysis patients is markedly higher compared to a nonuremic population. There are several cardiovascular (CV) risk factors that are unique to this population, one of which is dyslipidemia. Uremic patients do not usually develop hypercholesterolemia, but rather are characterized by high levels of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and elevated levels of modified low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, which are particularly harmful to the vascular wall. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been proven to be very efficient in reducing CV events in a nonrenal population. There are several landmark trials that have demonstrated that statins reduce the mortality in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in populations with normal, or close to normal, renal function. There are some observational registry data indicating that this may also be true in hemodialysis (HD) patients, but no prospective controlled trial has been performed to date.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover changes induced by 1-year simvastatin treatment on postmenopausal women. Thirty consecutive postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women (61.2 +/- 4.9 years) were treated for 12 months with 40 mg/day simvastatin and 30 normocholesterolemic age-matched postmenopausal women provided control data. In all subjects, at baseline and at 3-month intervals, serum lipids, calcium, phosphate, total and bone alkaline phosphatase (Bone-ALP), and carboxy-terminal fragment of type I collagen (CTx) were measured in a fasting blood sample. At baseline and after 6 and 12 months BMD was measured at lumbar spine (BMD-LS) and at femur (BMD-Ftot) and at femoral neck (BMD-Fn) by DXA. In the simvastatin-treated group Bone-ALP showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) with respect to baseline from the sixth month, whereas serum CTx showed a weak and nonsignificant increase over the study period. In treated women BMD-LS, BMD-Fn, and BMD-Ftot increased respectively by 1.1, 0.9, and 0.4% at Month 6; and by 2.8, 1.0, and 0.8% at Month 12. In controls BMD-LS, BMD-Fn, and BMD-Ftot at the end of the study period decreased by 1.6, 1.4, and 1.2%, respectively. The difference between controls and simvastatin-treated patients was significant (P < 0.05) for both BMD-LS and BMD-Fn only at Month 12.

    "86": "Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. They are, therefore, used clinically to lower cholesterol and prevent atherosclerosis. Statins have beneficial effects on multiple organ systems. Some of these effects are found in the absence of significant changes in cholesterol levels. Polyunsaturated fatty acids also inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and have many of the same beneficial effects of statins. Four statins (mevastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin) have been tested in rat liver cells for their effect on arachidonic acid (AA) release and prostaglandin I2 production induced in the presence of lactacystin and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Each statin stimulated release of AA and induced prostaglandin I2 production. Mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase, did not reduce the stimulation observed in the presence of simvastatin indicating that HMG-CoA reductase activity is not involved. In view of the multiple biologic properties of AA, the AA released as a result of the action of the statins may play a role in some of the pharmacological effects attributed to these drugs.", 
    "87": "Recent data on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis have revealed various mechanisms damaging the vessel wall by the reactive oxidative substances, mainly by the oxidised LDL, which lead to an inflammation process, resulting in the thickening of the arterial wall and atherosclerotic plaque formation. In these events the oxidative free radicals exert a lot of harmful effects: by the further oxidation of lipids, activation of smooth cells and macrophages, inducing apoptosis and necrosis of endothelial cells. These mechanisms can be blocked by some drugs at several points as listed in the paper. The results of observational studies and clinical trials by vitamin E, angiotensin convertase enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin type-1 receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and statin treatment are reviewed and evaluated. Possibilities of appropriate antioxidant substitution modes are put forward. Achievements in the regression of atherosclerotic plaques are discussed, since these therapeutic modalities render atherosclerosis a treatable disease.", 
    "88": "Statins can exert many pleiotropic effects beyond their cholesterol-lowering action. These effects mainly influence the vascular wall and may modulate beneficially endothelial function, atherogenesis and atherosclerotic plaque stability. Recent data suggest a possible positive effect of statins on prevention of osteoporosis and cancerogenesis. However, the magnitude of contribution of these pleiotropic statin effects to the reduction of morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases remains to be determined.", 
    "89": "Current treatment for atherosclerotic heart disease consists mainly of the administration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or 'statin' class of drugs. Statins, which lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and have numerous other effects in the arterial wall, have shown remarkable efficacy and an exemplary safety profile in preventing both primary and secondary atherosclerotic events. These agents, however, are less effective at raising high-density lipoprotein, lowering triglycerides and decreasing insulin resistance--all of which are important targets for the prevention of ischemic vascular disease. Agonists of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are among the most promising drug candidates to target these treatment gaps. Only PPARalpha agonists have been shown clinically to improve the outcome of atherosclerotic heart disease; however, it will only be a matter of time before we know whether compounds that modulate the function of PPARgamma and beta/delta are also efficacious at combating atherosclerosis.",

In patients with some interaction, the mean number of other drugs was significantly higher (4.51.5 vs 3.31.9 SD; P<.001). 19.1% of men and 10.8% of women showed interactions, the difference being statistically significant (P=.02). By means of logistic regression, both masculine gender (OR=1.8) and taking of other medication in quantities of 5 or more (OR=2.7) appeared as variables associated with the presence of interactions.",

    "95": "Abstract Antithrombotic treatment has now been joined by other evidence-based drug interventions for prevention of stroke, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. The efficacy of oral anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation has not been seen in other stroke-prone groups, although trials are continuing. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging improves diagnostic accuracy in acute stroke, which is important in arriving at the right secondary prevention strategy. Carotid endarterectomy has been shown to be beneficial for 50-69% symptomatic -stenosis but with a much narrower therapeutic index than for 70-99% stenosis. A comparison of endarterectomy with angioplasty and/or stent placement has been the subject of one small trial suggesting similar procedural stroke and mortality risks. Device closure of cardiac abnormalities increases in the absence of any trial data, and in spite of a low subsequent stroke risk for young patients with isolated patent foramen ovale treated with aspirin.",

Defining \"aggressive\" drug therapy mandates consideration of the target population, timing of initiation, time of administration, and, often, dose titration to achieve a desired effect on relevant \"biomarkers\" such as low-density lipoprotein levels. This review focuses on 2 groups of drug therapies now proven effective in prevention, namely the statins and antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, clopidogrel). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor(s), angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers are also proven of great value but are only noted in the table.",

It improves outcomes and increases patient motivation and long-term adherence. In addition, discontinuation of statin therapy in patients with ACS after hospital admission is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. Recent non-ST elevation ACS guidelines recommend beginning statin therapy, along with dietary intervention, in patients whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels exceed 130 mg/dl within 24-96 hours after hospital admission. Various strategies have been developed to aid in the implementation of in-hospital lipid-lowering therapy. Pharmacists can play a valuable role in optimizing drug therapy for dyslipidemia and ensuring long-term adherence.",

Atorvastatin has been shown to reduce efficiently the levels of atherogenic lipoproteins also in patients with renal failure, but pharmacokinetic data in haemodialysis patients are lacking.", 
    "99": "In this study, hypercholesterolaemic haemodialysis patients received 40 mg (n=12) or 80 mg (n=11) atorvastatin once daily, first as a single dose and then continuously for 2 weeks. Plasma levels of atorvastatin and its active and inactive metabolites were measured by LC/MS/MS, and pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max), t(max), AUC, t(1/2)) compared between single and multiple dosing, and between the different doses.", 
    "100": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of the parent drug atorvastatin acid were not significantly different after single and 2-week multiple dosing; they showed dose-proportionality between the 40 and 80 mg dose, and were comparable to findings in healthy volunteers. Dose-proportionality and absence of accumulation was also observed for the major active metabolite ortho-hydroxy-atorvastatin and the inactive metabolites atorvastatin lactone and ortho-hydroxy-atorvastatin lactone, but the levels of the active metabolite were relatively lower, and the inactive metabolites higher, compared with healthy volunteers. The para-hydroxy-metabolites constituted only a minor pathway in atorvastatin's metabolic elimination. Haemodialysis did not cause enhanced clearance of atorvastatin or its metabolites, the drug was well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events.", 
    "101": "While subtle differences may exist in the metabolic processing of atorvastatin in haemodialysis patients, active drug did not accumulate nor did it show enhanced elimination, and levels were comparable to those measured in healthy volunteers. Therefore there is no need to adapt atorvastatin dosage in this particular patient population.", 
    "102": "Combined hyperlipidemia predisposes subjects to coronary heart disease. Two lipid abnormalities--increased cholesterol and atherogenic dyslipidemia--are potential targets of lipid-lowering therapy. Successful management of both may require combined drug therapy. Statins are effective low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering drugs. For atherogenic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides, small LDL, and low high-density lipoprotein [HDL]), fibrates are potentially beneficial. The present study was designed to examine the safety and efficacy of a combination of low-dose simvastatin and fenofibrate in the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia. It was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a crossover design. Three randomized phases were employed (double placebo, simvastatin 10 mg/day and placebo, and simvastatin 10 mg/day plus fenofibrate 200 mg/day). Each phase lasted 3 months, and in the last week of each phase, measurements were made of plasma lipids, lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma apolipoproteins B, C-II, and C-III and LDL speciation on 3 consecutive days. Simvastatin therapy decreased total cholesterol by 27%, non-HDL cholesterol by 30%, total apolipoprotein B by 31%, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) + intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) cholesterol by 37%, VLDL + IDL apolipoprotein B by 14%, LDL cholesterol by 28%, and LDL apolipoprotein B by 21%. The addition of fenofibrate caused an additional decrease in VLDL + IDL cholesterol and VLDL + IDL apolipoprotein B by 36% and 32%, respectively. Simvastatin alone caused a small increase in the ratio of large-to-small LDL, whereas the addition of fenofibrate to simvastatin therapy caused a marked increase in the ratio of large-to-small LDL species. Simvastatin alone produced a small (6%) and insignificant increase in HDL cholesterol concentrations. When fenofibrate was added to simvastatin therapy, HDL cholesterol increased significantly by 23%. No significant side effects were observed with either simvastatin alone or with combined drug therapy. Therefore, a combination of simvastatin 10 mg/day and fenofibrate 200 mg/day appears to be effective and safe for the treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemia in combined hyperlipidemia.", 
    "103": "Neutrophil-endothelial adhesion is a crucial step in vascular inflammation, which is recognized as the direct cause of atherosclerosis-mediated serious diseases. We demonstrated previously that high glucose increased adhesion in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner within 48 h through increasing surface expression of endothelial adhesion molecules. On the other hand, statins, used for patients with hypercholesterolemia, have been shown to decrease the incidence of atherosclerosis-mediated diseases, but direct effects of statins on endothelial cells remain unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of these compounds on high glucose-mediated neutrophil-endothelial adhesion with respect to the participation of PKC and nitric oxide (NO). After human endothelial cells were cultured for 48 h in high glucose medium, neutrophils from healthy volunteers were added and allowed to adhere for 30 min. Adhered neutrophils were quantified by measuring their myeloperoxidase activities, and surface expression of endothelial adhesion molecules was determined with an enzyme immunoassay. Both pravastatin (0.05 microM) and fluvastatin (0.5 microM) significantly attenuated the adhesion mediated by 27.8 mM glucose for 48 h through decreasing surface expression of endothelial adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, P-selectin, and E-selectin). NO synthase inhibitors reduced the inhibitory effects of statins, whereas statins did not affect the adhesion mediated by a PKC activator. These data suggest that statins act directly on endothelial cells to inhibit expression of adhesion molecules and neutrophil adhesion mediated by high glucose through increasing endothelial NO production, but not by inhibiting PKC.",

The 2,000/40 dose achieved greater mean reductions in LDL-C (-42%) than 1,000/20 (-28%, p < 0.001), lovastatin 40 mg (-32%, p < 0.05), or niacin ER 2,000 mg (-14%, p < 0.05). The 2,000/40 dose was significantly more effective in increasing HDL-C levels (+30%) than the 1,000/20 dose (+21%, p = 0.016). The decrease in TG was greater with 2,000/40 (-43%) than with 1,000/20 (-26%, p = 0.009). All three niacin-containing treatments were more effective than lovastatin monotherapy in reducing lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels. Flushing caused 12 (11%) patients receiving niacin ER/lovastatin and I patient receiving lovastatin alone to withdraw. No drug-related myopathy was noted.

Risk factors for heart failure include coronary artery disease and other atherosclerotic vascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, renal insufficiency, obesity, and family history of cardiomyopathy. Essential strategies for prevention of heart failure are modification of risk factors for heart failure development; comprehensive hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes treatment; and detection and treatment of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. The B-type natriuretic peptide assay may aid in identifying asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in patients with risk factors for heart failure. In patients with hypertension, atherosclerosis, and/or diabetes, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, beta-blocker, aspirin, and statin therapy can prevent progression to symptomatic heart failure. Avoidance of calcium channel-blockers as first-line antihypertensive therapy can also reduce the risk of heart failure. There remain substantial opportunities to improve implementation of therapies proven to prevent heart failure in the large number of patients at risk.", 
    "114": "The role of rat organic anion transporter 3 (rOat3; Slc22a8) in the efflux transport at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was characterized. The expression of rOat1, rOat2, and rOat3 in the brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC) was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, which showed that there was no expression of rOat1 or rOat2, but moderate expression of rOat3. The expression of rOat3 in the BCEC was further confirmed by Western blotting. Immunohistochemical staining showed that rOat3 is located on the abluminal and, possibly, luminal membrane of the BCEC. The contribution of rOat3 to the efflux of para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) and benzylpenicillin (PCG), substrates of rOat3, from the cerebrum into the blood circulation across the BBB was evaluated using the Brain Efflux Index method. PAH and PCG were eliminated from the cerebrum with rate constants of 0.039 and 0.043 min-1, respectively, and the elimination was saturated at high substrate concentrations. Taking account of the dilution in the brain, the Km values for the elimination of PAH and PCG were estimated to be 168 and 29 micro M, respectively. The efflux of PAH and PCG across the BBB was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by unlabeled PCG and PAH, respectively. The Ki value of PAH for the efflux of PCG was 106 micro M and that of PCG for the efflux of PAH was 58 micro M. These values were comparable with their Km values, suggesting that they share the same efflux mechanism at the BBB. Furthermore, cimetidine and pravastatin, which are also substrates and inhibitors of rOat3, significantly inhibited the efflux of PAH and PCG from the cerebrum. These results suggest that rOat3 is responsible for the elimination of PAH and PCG from the brain across the BBB.", 
    "115": "Seven hypertriglyceridemic patients with type-2 diabetes were treated with atorvastatin (40 mg/day) for 2 months. Kinetics of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100)-containing lipoproteins were determined before and after atorvastatin treatment and compared with data obtained in five normolipidemic volunteers. ApoB100 metabolism was studied using stable isotopes and multicompartmental modeling. Compared with normolipidemic obese subjects, type-2 diabetic patients had a higher apoB100 concentration in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (P < 0.005). Kinetic analysis showed an increase in the total apoB100 production rate (P < 0.005) related to VLDL apoB100 overproduction (P < 0.005). Patients were also characterized by a lower fractional catabolic rate (FCR) in VLDL (not significant) or IDL (P < 0.005) mainly related to a decrease in VLDL and IDL delipidation rate (P < 0.005). Catabolism of LDL was also lower in diabetic patients (P < 0.05). Atorvastatin treatment significantly decreased plasma triglycerides (P < 0.05), total and LDL cholesterol (P < 0.05), apoB100 in LDL, IDL, and VLDL (P < 0.05). Treatment significantly decreased total apoB100 production rate (P < 0.05), but only for VLDL (P < 0.05). Treatment normalized FCR in IDL and LDL (P < 0.05). We concluded that atorvastatin improved lipid abnormalities in type-2 diabetic patients not only by increasing the clearance of apoB100-containing lipoproteins but also by decreasing VLDL production.",

Pravastatin significantly reduced the risk of all prespecified cardiovascular events in all LIPID patients. Relative treatment effects in women did not differ significantly from those in men (P >.05) for any events except hospitalization for unstable angina. There were too few events to demonstrate separately significant effects in women; the estimated relative risk reduction with pravastatin was 11% (95% CI -18%-33%) for coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 18% (95% CI -25%-46%) for coronary heart disease death, 16% (95% CI -19%-41%) for myocardial infarction, and 17% (95% CI -2%-33%) for coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization.",

However, despite lipoprotein oxidation's biologically plausible role in atherogenesis, several studies have reported inconsistent effects of antioxidants on clinical coronary end points, in sharp contrast with the studies of lipid modification with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors, or statins. There appears to be little support for the use of antioxidants in coronary prevention. However, the picture remains incomplete. What are the limitations of available antioxidant studies and the agents used? Until the picture can be clarified, lipid modification with strategies proved to reduce the risk for coronary events, such as statins or dietary changes in the style of the Mediterranean diet, should be better implemented in clinical practice.", 
    "122": "Low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is an important predictor of risk for coronary artery disease. Although current treatment guidelines for dyslipidemia do not include specific targets for HDL cholesterol, the categorical definition of low HDL cholesterol has been changed from <35 mg/dL to <40 mg/dL. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl reductase inhibitors (statins) increase HDL cholesterol to a moderate degree. Fibrates also increase HDL cholesterol to a moderate degree and have additive effects with statins. Niacin is the most potent currently available agent for increasing HDL cholesterol, and its effects are also additive to those of statins. Other agents that increase HDL cholesterol include thiazolidinediones, estrogen, and omega-3 fatty acids. The mechanisms by which nonstatin pharmacologic agents increase HDL cholesterol are not completely understood but probably involve multiple mechanisms for each class.", 
    "123": "The role of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in coronary artery disease (CAD) and the impact of therapeutic agents on LDL cholesterol are well established. Less is known about the role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and even less about the role of the different HDL subspecies in CAD. HDL particles vary in size and density, mainly because of differences in the number of apolipoprotein (apo) particles and the amount of cholesterol ester in the core of HDL. Apo A-I is essential and, together with lipid, sufficient for the formation of HDL particles. Apo A-I-containing HDL particles play a primary role in cholesterol efflux from membranes, at least in part through interactions with the adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). Patients with Tangier disease have mutations in the gene encoding ABCA1, which result in functionally impaired protein, a marked deficiency in HDL cholesterol, and a high risk of premature CAD. Our studies of apo A-I-containing HDL subpopulations in various patient populations reveal that patients homozygous for Tangier disease have only the pre-beta(1) HDL subspecies. Tangier heterozygotes are severely depleted in the larger alpha- and pre-alpha-mobility subspecies. Patients with low HDL cholesterol levels and those with CAD also show deficiencies in the alpha(1) and pre-alpha(1-3) HDL subspecies. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) increase the levels of the large alpha(1) and pre-alpha(1) subpopulations and decrease the level of the small alpha(3) subpopulation. Thus, atorvastatin, for example, significantly moves the distribution of HDL particles toward normal, followed by simvastatin, pravastatin, and lovastatin in decreasing order of efficiency. A new statin, rosuvastatin, produces greater increases in HDL cholesterol than atorvastatin, but its effect on HDL particle distribution is yet to be determined.",

Two weeks of treatment with TAK-475 in a diet admixture (0.02% and 0.07%; approximately 30 and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively) significantly lowered plasma non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 19% and 41%, respectively, in homozygous LDL receptor knockout mice. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, simvastatin and atorvastatin (in 0.02% and 0.07% admixtures), also reduced plasma levels of non-HDL cholesterol. In homozygous WHHL rabbits, 4 weeks of treatment with TAK-475 (0.27%; approximately 100 mg/kg/day) lowered plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipid levels by 17%, 52% and 26%, respectively. In Triton WR-1339-treated rabbits, TAK-475 inhibited to the same extent the rate of secretion from the liver of the cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipid components of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). These results suggest that the lipid-lowering effects of TAK-475 in WHHL rabbits are based partially on the inhibition of secretion of VLDL from the liver. TAK-475 had no effect on plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities. Thus, the squalene synthase inhibitor TAK-475 revealed lipid-lowering effects in both LDL receptor knockout mice and WHHL rabbits.", 
    "125": "Atherosclerosis is a progressive systemic disorder that, in the initial stages, is often asymptomatic. The measurement of atherosclerotic burden using imaging techniques enables the clinical benefits of lipid-modifying therapies to be assessed in early atherosclerosis and facilitates more rapid evaluation of interventions in clinical trials compared with the measurement of clinical outcome. The effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as 'statins', on disease progression has been assessed in a number of imaging studies both in patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD) and in those with subclinical atherosclerosis. Statins slow plaque progression and, in early atherosclerosis, they have been demonstrated to promote regression of atherosclerotic lesions. The benefits of statin therapy on soft atherosclerotic plaques that are still developing support the use of vascular measures to detect subclinical atherosclerosis, and the subsequent early intervention with statin therapy. Moreover, given that the effects of statins on atherosclerosis progression are evident even in normocholesterolaemic patients at increased risk of developing CHD, early intervention with statin therapy may be effective in preventing CHD, irrespective of lipid level.", 
    "126": "3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors are widely used to decrease plasma cholesterol levels in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who are at increased risk of premature coronary artery disease. Tissue-culture and animal studies have indicated that administration of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (eg, lovastatin, simvastatin, etc) induces a compensatory increase in the activity of HMG CoA reductase, both by increasing its synthesis and decreasing catabolism. To determine in human subjects whether cessation of therapy with this class of drugs leads to induction of HMG CoA reductase activity and above-normal rates of cholesterol biosynthesis, we measured urinary concentrations of mevalonic acid (an indicator of cholesterol biosynthesis) after the cessation of therapy with lovastatin and simvastatin (80 mg/day) in patients with heterozygous FH. Plasma concentrations of LDL increased promptly on discontinuation of reductase inhibitor therapy but did not increase above pretreatment levels at any point after drug discontinuation. Similarly, the 24-hour urinary excretion of mevalonic acid was reduced during treatment with lovastatin or simvastatin and increased promptly on discontinuation of drug but did not increase to levels exceeding those found at baseline when the patients were receiving dietary therapy only. We conclude that cessation of treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors in patients with FH does not result in a rebound increase in cholesterol biosynthesis and that no rebound overshoot occurs in plasma concentrations of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol.", 
    "127": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important role in postnatal neovascularization of ischemic tissue. Ex vivo expansion of EPCs might be useful for potential clinical cell therapy of myocardial ischemia. However, cultivation of primary cells leads to cellular aging (senescence), thereby severely limiting the proliferative capacity. Therefore, we investigated whether statins might be able to prevent senescence of EPCs. EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood and characterized. After ex vivo cultivation, EPCs became senescent as determined by acidic beta-galactosidase staining. Atorvastatin or mevastatin dose-dependently inhibited the onset of EPC senescence in culture. Moreover, atorvastatin increased proliferation of EPCs as assessed by BrdU incorporation and colony-forming capacity. Whereas geranylgeranylpyrophosphate or farnesylpyrophosphate reduced the senescence inhibitory effect of atorvastatin, NO synthase inhibition, antioxidants, or Rho kinase inhibitors had no effect. To get further insights into the underlying downstream effects of statins, we measured telomerase activity and determined the expression of various cell cycle regulatory genes by using a microarray assay. Whereas telomerase activity did not change, atorvastatin modulated expression of cell cycle genes including upregulation of cyclins and downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1. Taken together, statins inhibited senescence of EPCs independent of NO, reactive oxygen species, and Rho kinase, but dependent on geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Atorvastatin-mediated prevention of EPC senescence appears to be mediated by the regulation of various cell cycle proteins. The inhibition of EPC senescence and induction of EPC proliferation by statins in vitro may importantly improve the functional activity of EPCs for potential cell therapy.", 
    "128": "Arterial hypertension is, besides age, the number one risk factor for ischaemic stroke. Patients with arterial hypertension frequently present with additional coexisting vascular risk factors interacting in a complex way.", 
    "129": "This paper reviews the benefit of antihypertensive treatment, as well as different treatment options of arterial hypertension and their side-effects.", 
    "130": "Patients with definite arterial hypertension, but also patients with so-called normal or high-normal blood pressure are at increased risk to develop stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Vascular remodelling of small and large vessels provoked by arterial hypertension is the initial step in the development of atherosclerosis and lipohyalinosis. Vascular remodelling can be improved or even normalized by antihypertensive treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-I-receptor antagonists showing the most convincing effects. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-I-receptor antagonists have the lowest rate of side-effects, however, economic restraints hinder their general application. Statins are needed to treat dyslipidaemia. They also lower blood pressure and have a synergistic effect with the above two antihypertensive components in lowering blood pressure. In hypertensive patients, risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications is determined by the blood pressure level and the presence or absence of target organ damage and the interaction with other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes. These high-risk patients should be treated even more aggressively than usual.", 
    "131": "In the vast majority of patients and healthy individuals, target blood pressure should be as high as or below 120/80 mmHg to minimize the occurrence of stroke and other cardiovascular complications.", 
    "132": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are associated with skeletal muscle complaints, including clinically important myositis and rhabdomyolysis, mild serum creatine kinase (CK) elevations, myalgia with and without elevated CK levels, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and persistent myalgia and CK elevations after statin withdrawal. We performed a literature review to provide a clinical summary of statin-associated myopathy and discuss possible mediating mechanisms. We also update the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reports on statin-associated rhabdomyolysis. Articles on statin myopathy were identified via a PubMed search through November 2002 and articles on statin clinical trials, case series, and review articles were identified via a PubMed search through January 2003. Adverse event reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis were also collected from the FDA MEDWATCH database. The literature review found that reports of muscle problems during statin clinical trials are extremely rare. The FDA MEDWATCH Reporting System lists 3339 cases of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis reported between January 1, 1990, and March 31, 2002. Cerivastatin was the most commonly implicated statin. Few data are available regarding the frequency of less-serious events such as muscle pain and weakness, which may affect 1% to 5% of patients. The risk of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse effects with statin use can be exacerbated by several factors, including compromised hepatic and renal function, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and concomitant medications. Medications such as the fibrate gemfibrozil alter statin metabolism and increase statin plasma concentration. How statins injure skeletal muscle is not clear, although recent evidence suggests that statins reduce the production of small regulatory proteins that are important for myocyte maintenance.", 
    "133": "Formation of nitric oxide-derived oxidants may serve as a mechanism linking inflammation to development of atherosclerosis. Nitrotyrosine, a specific marker for protein modification by nitric oxide-derived oxidants, is enriched in human atherosclerotic lesions and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) recovered from human atheroma.", 
    "134": "To determine whether systemic levels of nitrotyrosine are associated with the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and are modulated by hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy.", 
    "135": "A case-control and interventional study at 2 urban tertiary-care referral centers; recruitment for each was from June 1, 2001, until January 1, 2002. For the case-control study, 100 case-patients with established CAD and 108 patients with no clinically evident CAD were recruited consecutively. In the interventional study, participants aged 21 years or older with hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol > or =130 mg/dL [> or =3.5 mmol/L]) underwent nutrition and exercise counseling. Those whose levels did not decrease with 6 to 8 weeks were enrolled in the study (n = 35). For 12 weeks, they received 10 mg/d of oral atorvastatin therapy.", 
    "136": "In the case-control study, the association between systemic levels of protein-bound nitrotyrosine, CAD risk, and presence of CAD. In the interventional study, the change in nitrotyrosine, lipoprotein, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.", 
    "137": "Nitrotyrosine levels were significantly higher among patients with CAD (median 9.1 micromol/mol [interquartile range, 4.8-13.8 micromol/mol] tyrosine vs 5.2 micromol/mol [interquartile range, 2.2-8.4 micromol/mol]; P<.001). Patients in the upper quartile of nitrotyrosine (29%; P<.001) had a higher odds of CAD compared with those in the lowest quartile (unadjusted odds ratio, 6.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-14.0; P<.001). In multivariate models adjusting for Framingham Global Risk Score and CRP, upper quartiles of nitrotyrosine remained associated with CAD (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-10.6; P<.001). Statin therapy reduced nitrotyrosine levels significantly (25%; P<.02) with a magnitude similar to reductions in total cholesterol levels (25%; P<.001) and LDL particle number (29%; P<.001) yet were independent of alterations in lipoproteins and inflammatory markers like CRP.", 
    "138": "The findings from this preliminary study indicate that nitrotyrosine levels are associated with the presence of CAD and appear to be modulated by statin therapy. These results suggest a potential role for nitric oxide-derived oxidants as inflammatory mediators in CAD and may have implications for atherosclerosis risk assessment and monitoring of anti-inflammatory actions of statins."
