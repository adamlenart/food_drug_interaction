We compared the effect of a statin and a fibrate (atorvastatin and fenofibrate) on plasma levels of homocysteine and other thiol compounds in hyperlipidemic patients.", 
    "1": "The study was of open randomized, parallel design with a preliminary screening phase, and a 6 week placebo period. After the placebo period, patients were allocated randomly to atorvastatin or fenofibrate for a 6 month period. Plasma thiols were assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. There were 29 patients in the fenofibrate group and 24 in the atorvastatin group. Fenofibrate induced a significant increase in both homocysteine and cysteine plasma levels (+35.8 and +18%, respectively, P<0.0001); by contrast, cysteinylglycine remained stable. There were no significant changes in any thiol compounds in the atorvastatin group. Both treatments induced a significant decrease in uric acid, although fenofibrate was noticeably more effective than atorvastatin (-22.8 and -6.4%, respectively). Fenofibrate induced a non-significant increase in creatinine (12%) while atorvastatin reduced it (4.7%, NS).", 
    "2": "Our study confirms that the induction of elevations in plasma homocysteine and cysteine levels are a distinct feature of the pleiotropic effects of fibrates. Further studies are needed not only to investigate the potential deleterious effects of this modification, but also to define the specific mechanism which underlies such fibrate-mediated action.", 
    "3": "Atherosclerosis remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Western countries. Recent evidence has demonstrated that atherosclerosis is not simply a disease of lipid deposition. Inflammation plays a major role in the initiation, progression, and destabilization of atheromas. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a circulating acute-phase reactant that reflects active systemic inflammation. Large prospective trials have shown hs-CRP to be a strong predictor of future cardiovascular events. Increased hs-CRP concentration is in fact associated with higher cardiovascular events in individuals with and without clinical evidence of atherosclerotic disease. The relative risk associated with hs-CRP is independent of other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Assays for hs-CRP measurement are currently available but must be standardized because patients' results will be interpreted by using population-based cutpoints. A risk-stratifying algorithm incorporating hs-CRP and total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio has been proposed. Further research into the mechanisms and pharmacological treatment of vascular disease will provide novel management strategies in the very near future.",

    "6": "Despite well-documented clinical benefit of the use of statins in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and even mild lipid elevations, studies have documented the presence of a significant \"treatment gap\" between those patients in whom treatment is indicated and those patients who actually receive it. It has been proposed that a prescription for statin therapy given to indicated patients at the time of initial angiographic diagnosis of CAD has the potential to improve long-term medication compliance, but this requires further evaluation. We prospectively followed 600 patients with angiographically demonstrated CAD (diameter stenosis > or = 70%) who met the National Cholesterol Education Project (NCEP) guidelines for statin therapy for an average of 3.0 years (range 2.0 to 4.6). Patients were an average of 65 years of age, 78% were men, 77% presented initially with acute ischemic syndrome, and 64 (10.7%) died during follow-up. Overall, 105 patients (18%) were discharged from the initial hospitalization with a statin prescription. At long-term follow-up, the number of patients taking statins had increased to 47%. However, long-term statin compliance was significantly higher among patients initially discharged with a statin prescription than those who were not (77% vs 40%; p < 0.0001). Additionally, those patients discharged with a statin prescription had significantly reduced mortality rate at long-term follow-up (5.7% vs 11.7%; p = 0.05). Cox hazard regression analysis, controlling for all known clinical baseline variables, confirmed the absence of a prehospital discharge statin prescription to be an independent predictor of increased mortality (hazard ratio 2.4) with a statistical trend (p = 0.06). Thus, this study demonstrates that after angiographic diagnosis of CAD, prescription of appropriate statin therapy at the time of hospital discharge improves long-term statin compliance and may significantly enhance survival.", 
    "7": "The Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) is a randomized, practice-based trial sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). The double-blind, active-controlled component of ALLHAT was designed to determine whether the rate of the primary outcome-a composite of fatal coronary heart disease and nonfatal myocardial infarction-differs between diuretic (chlorthalidone) treatment and each of three other classes of antihypertensive drugs: a calcium antagonist (amlodipine), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), and an alpha-adrenergic blocker (doxazosin) in high-risk hypertensive persons ages 55 years and older. In addition, 10,377 ALLHAT participants with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia were also enrolled in a randomized, open-label trial designed to determine whether lowering serum LDL cholesterol with an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) will reduce all-cause mortality as compared to a control group receiving \"usual care.\" In January 2000, an independent data review committee recommended discontinuing the doxazosin treatment arm. The NHLBI director promptly accepted the recommendation. This article discusses the steps involved in the orderly closeout of one arm of ALLHAT and the dissemination of trial results. These steps included provisional preparations; the actual decision process; establishing a timetable; forming a transition committee; preparing materials and instructions; informing 65 trial officers and coordinators, 628 active clinics and satellite locations, 313 institutional review boards, over 42,000 patients, and the general public; reporting detailed trial results; and monitoring the closeout process.

    "8": "T cells are prominent components of both early and late atherosclerotic lesions and the role of Th1/Th2 cells subsets in the evolution and rupture of the plaque is currently under investigation. Statins, which are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, exert actions beyond that of simply lowering cholesterol levels, and some effects on immune function have been reported. We studied in vitro the effects of fluvastatin on Th1/Th2 cytokine release in relation to caspase-1 activation, in human peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated or not with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Fluvastatin treatment resulted in the activation of caspase-1 and in a small secretion of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-18, and IFNgamma (Th1). In the presence of bacteria, the release of these cytokines was highly increased by the statin in a synergistic way. By contrast, production of IL-12, IL-10 and IL-4 were unaffected by the statin. Not only did mevalonate abolish the effects of the statin but it also prevented the caspase-1 activation induced by the bacteria, suggesting the involvement of isoprenoids in the response to M. tuberculosis. It is proposed that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase may be immunoprotective by enhancing the Th1 response, which has therapeutical potential not only in atherosclerosis but also in infectious diseases.", 
    "9": "The short- and long-term in vitro effects of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin, compared with lovastatin and simvastatin on VLDL secretion, and on the formation and the neutral and acid lysosomal hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters was investigated in rat liver hepatocytes maintained in suspension (2 or 4 h) or cultured in monolayers (24 h). All statins time-dependently reduced [14C]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl esters, but when exogenous cholesterol was added only atorvastatin caused an immediate transient decrease in hepatocyte ACAT activity. Activity of the lysosomal, microsomal and cytosolic CEH isoforms was unaffected by the hepatocyte treatments. Statins reduced free and esterified cholesterol mass in hepatocyte microsomes after 2 h, and this was followed by a modest decline in VLDL cholesteryl esters, whilst secretion of VLDL apoB and triglycerides was unaltered. However, after 24 h of treatment, statins caused generalized 20-40% decreases in the secretion of VLDL apoB, cholesterol and triglycerides, with the reduction in apoB48 secretion being significantly superior to that caused in apoB100. The mean diameter of secreted VLDL was not modified by either duration or drug treatment. Additional studies with subcellular fractions demonstrated that statins have a direct selective effect on the enzymes governing the cholesterol-cholesteryl ester cycle, with the exception of the microsomal CEH. Atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin inhibited ACAT activity in microsomes by 50% at doses of 250, 100 and 50 microM, respectively. The cytosolic CEH elicited a biphasic profile of activity with activations up to 100 microM statin and inhibitions above 250 microM, and the lysosomal CEH was only inhibited by atorvastatin at a dose of 100 microM or more. We conclude that a prolonged, but not a short, limited availability of hepatocyte cholesterol derived from the endogenous synthesis reduces VLDL secretion, and that reactivity of statins at the cellular level are more similar than reactivity at the subcellular level as regards the cholesterol-cholesteryl ester cycle.", 
    "10": "The cholesterol-lowering drug, simvastatin, is a pro-drug of a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor and inhibits cholesterol synthesis in humans and animals. In addition, the bone effects of statins including simvastatin are being studied. We assessed the effects of simvastatin on osteoblastic differentiation in nontransformed osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1) and rat bone marrow cells. Simvastatin enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. This stimulatory effect of the statin was observed at relatively low doses (significant at 10(-8) M and maximal at 10(-7) M). Northern blot analysis showed that the statin (10(-7) M) increased in bone morphogenetic protein-2 as well as ALP mRNA concentrations in MC3T3-E1 cells. Simvastatin (10(-7) M) slightly increased in type I collagen mRNA abundance throughout the culture period, whereas it markedly inhibited the gene expression of collagenase-1 between days 14 and 22 of culture. These results indicate that simvastatin has anabolic effects on bone through the promotion of osteoblastic differentiation, suggesting that it could be used for the treatment of common metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis.", 
    "11": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin is able to produce endothelium-dependent relaxation in addition to its lipid-lowering properties. The underlying mechanisms were investigated in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Simvastatin induced an increase in cytosolic calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) in BAEC, by releasing Ca(2+) from intracellular stores sensitive to thapsigargin and ryanodine, and increasing Ca(2+) entry. Simvastatin response was not altered by the phospholipase A(2) inhibitor ONO-RS-082, or the combination of superoxide dismutase plus catalase. However, the response to simvastatin was reduced by the product of HMG-CoA reductase, mevalonate or by the inhibitor of small G proteins of the Rho family, Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin. Thus, increase in [Ca(2+)](i) involving the activation of Rho protein through mevalonate-dependent pathway is essential for the action of simvastatin and might contribute to its beneficial effects against vascular diseases. This study helps elucidate the mechanisms of endothelial factor generation by simvastatin in BAEC.", 
    "12": "Interaction of mesangial cells with extracellular matrix proteins can provide a means to modify cellular anchorage and traction through an interaction of integrins with activation of the actin cytoskeleton. We investigated intracellular signalling of matrix components fibronectin and laminin in mesangial cells in monolayer and 3-dimensional configurations to show a fibronectin-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (up to threefold), which is augmented by a laminin-dependent increase in phospholipase D activity. Functional responsiveness to fibronectin and laminin addition was seen in the contraction of free-floating 3-dimensional mesangial cell-embedded collagen gels, a well-defined system reflecting coupling of extracellular matrix-cell events to activation of the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase and contraction of mesangial cell-embedded collagen gels in response to fibronectin and laminin were inhibited by pretreatment of mesangial cells with lovastatin and restored by isoprenoid augmentation with geranylgeraniol, supporting a role for the ras-related protein Rho in this process.", 
    "13": "The surprising discovery that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) act via inhibition of the mevalonate-to-cholesterol pathway raised the possibility that esophageal irritation by N-BPs is mechanism-based. We used normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) to model N-BP effects on stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus. The N-BPs alendronate and risedronate inhibited NHEK growth in a dose-dependent manner without inducing apoptosis. N-BPs (30 microM) caused accumulation of cells in S phase and increased binucleation (inhibited cytokinesis). Consistent with N-BP inhibition of isoprenylation, geranylgeraniol or farnesol prevented accumulation in S phase. Binucleation was also induced by the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor lovastatin and by the squalene synthase inhibitor zaragozic acid A and was prevented by adding low-density lipoprotein. At 300 microM, N-BPs reduced expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2 and cdk4 and enhanced expression of p21(waf1) and p27(kip1) and their binding to cdks with corollary hypophosphorylation of retinoblastoma. Lovastatin and zaragozic acid A produced similar effects, except that p21(waf1) expression and binding to cdks was not induced. Growth inhibition, but not binucleation, was also caused by the geranylgeranyl transferase I inhibitor, GGTI-298, which also enhanced cdk2 and cdk4 association with p27(kip1). These findings are consistent with suppression of epithelial cell growth by N-BPs via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway and the consequent reduction in cholesterol synthesis, which blocks cytokinesis, and in geranylgeranylation, which interferes with progression through the cell cycle.", 
    "14": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin)-mediated lowering of serum cholesterol has been associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Recent studies suggest that additional non-lipid lowering effects (eg, endothelial stabilization, anti-inflammatory, antithrombogenic) may be important in modulating their effectiveness. Dyslipidemia is common in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hemodialysis patients have increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cerivastatin, a new statin with powerful low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering capabilities, possesses some unique non-LDL-C-mediated properties that may contribute to a reduction of coronary events in the patient with ESRD. The primary objective of this multicenter multinational study of 1,054 hemodialysis patients is to compare 2 years of treatment with cerivastatin (0.4 mg/d) versus placebo on the composite clinical event rate of myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ischemic stroke, and the need for coronary arterial bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures in these patients. Changes in lipids, inflammatory proteins including heat stable C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin-M, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte-chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), as well as markers of cardiac muscle pathology, such as troponin I and troponin T, will be assessed in a subset of patients. This study is the first of its kind to assess the effect of a statin on the reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in an incident hemodialysis population. It will determine whether treatment with cerivastatin can effectively reduce the significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "15": "Patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria have impaired clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. This results in the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (mild hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoproteins [HDL], and excess small, dense low-density lipoproteins [LDLIII]). Excess remnant lipoproteins (RLP) are linked to hypertriglyceridemia and may contribute to the atherogenicity of nephrotic dyslipidemia. A randomized crossover study compared the effects of a statin (cerivastatin) and a fibrate (fenofibrate) on LDLIII and RLP in 12 patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria. Cerivastatin reduced cholesterol (21%, P: < 0.01), triglyceride (14%, P: < 0.05), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C; 23%, P: < 0.01), total LDL (18%, P: < 0.01), and LDLIII concentration (27% P: < 0.01). %LDLIII, RLP-C, and RLP triglyceride (RLP-TG) were unchanged. Plasma LDLIII reduction with cerivastatin treatment correlated with LDL-C reduction (r(2) = 34%, P: < 0.05). Fenofibrate lowered cholesterol (19%), triglyceride (41%), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (52%), LDLIII concentration (49%), RLP-C (35%), and RLP-TG (44%; all P: < 0.01). Fenofibrate also reduced %LDLIII from 60 to 33% (P: < 0.01). HDL-C (19%, P: < 0.01) increased with fenofibrate treatment; LDL-C and total LDL were unchanged. The reduction in LDLIII concentration and RLP-C with fenofibrate treatment correlated with plasma triglyceride reduction (LDLIII r(2) = 67%, P: < 0.001; RLP cholesterol r(2) = 58%, P: < 0.005). Serum creatinine increased with fenofibrate treatment (14%, P: < 0.01); however, creatinine clearance was unchanged. LDLIII concentration was 187 +/- 85 mg/dl after cerivastatin treatment and 133 +/- 95 mg/dl after fenofibrate treatment. Cerivastatin and fenofibrate reduce LDLIII concentration in nephrotic-range proteinuria. However, atherogenic concentrations of LDLIII remain prevalent after either treatment. Fenofibrate but not cerivastatin reduces remnant lipoproteins. The two treatments seem to reduce LDLIII by different mechanisms, suggesting a potential role for combination therapy to optimize lowering of LDLIII and RLP.", 
    "16": "Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability. Although clinical trials of the early lipid-lowering therapies did not demonstrate a reduction in the rates of stroke, data from recently completed statin trials strongly suggest benefit.", 
    "17": "The effect of pravastatin 40 mg/d on stroke events was investigated in a prospectively defined pooled analysis of 3 large, placebo-controlled, randomized trials that included 19 768 patients with 102 559 person-years of follow-up. In all, 598 participants had a stroke during approximately 5 years of follow-up. The 2 secondary prevention trials (CARE [Cholesterol And Recurrent Events] and LIPID [Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease]) individually demonstrated reductions in nonfatal and total stroke rates. When the 13 173 patients from CARE and LIPID were combined, there was a 22% reduction in total strokes (95% CI 7% to 35%, P:=0.01) and a 25% reduction in nonfatal stroke (95% CI 10% to 38%). The beneficial effect of pravastatin on total stroke was observed across a wide range of patient characteristics. WOSCOPS (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, a primary prevention trial in hypercholesterolemic men) exhibited a similar, although smaller, trend for a reduction in total stroke. Among the CARE/LIPID participants, pravastatin was associated with a 23% reduction in nonhemorrhagic strokes (95% CI 6% to 37%), but there was no statistical treatment group difference in hemorrhagic or unknown type.",

    "20": "Our definition of diabetes mellitus was based on the American Diabetic Association threshold of a blood glucose level of >/=7.0 mmol/L. Subjects who self-reported diabetes at baseline or had a baseline glucose level of >/=7.0 mmol/L were excluded from the analyses. A total of 5974 of the 6595 randomized subjects were included in the analysis, and 139 subjects became diabetic during the study. The baseline predictors of the transition from normal glucose control to diabetes were studied. In the univariate model, body mass index, log triglyceride, log white blood cell count, systolic blood pressure, total and HDL cholesterol, glucose, and randomized treatment assignment to pravastatin were significant predictors. In a multivariate model, body mass index, log triglyceride, glucose, and pravastatin therapy were retained as predictors of diabetes in this cohort.", 
    "21": "We concluded that the assignment to pravastatin therapy resulted in a 30% reduction (P:=0.042) in the hazard of becoming diabetic. By lowering plasma triglyceride levels, pravastatin therapy may favorably influence the development of diabetes, but other explanations, such as the anti-inflammatory properties of this drug in combination with its endothelial effects, cannot be excluded with these analyses.", 
    "22": "We investigated the role of the intrinsic mevalonate cascade in the neuronal cell death (NCD) induced by the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase in rat primary cortical neurons cultured from the brains of 17-d-old fetal SD rats. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors induced NCD [HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor-induced NCD (H-NCD)] in time- and dose-dependent manners. The apoptotic characteristics were revealed by the formation of the DNA ladder and by the electron microscopical observation. During the progression of H-NCD, p53 was induced followed by the expression of Bax. Although the mevalonate completely inhibited H-NCD, the cholesterol did not. Thus, we examined two major metabolites of mevalonate, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP), using a novel liposome system for uptake into the cells. GGPP, not FPP, prohibited H-NCD with inhibition of the induction of p53 and Bax. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase decreased the amount of membrane-associated Rho small GTPase families, but not Ras small GTPase, and GGPP restored the blockage by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in the translocation or redistribution of Rho small GTPase families to membrane. These data indicated that (1) the inhibition of the intrinsic mevalonate cascade induces the apoptotic NCD with the induction of p53 followed by that of Bax, (2) the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase concomitantly causes blockage of the translocation or redistribution of Rho small GTPase families, not Ras small GTPase, to membrane, and (3) GGPP, not FPP, is one of the essential metabolites in the mevalonate cascade for protecting neurons from H-NCD.", 
    "23": "The amino acid leucine is efficiently used by the trypanosomatid Leishmania mexicana for sterol biosynthesis. The incubation of [2-(13)C]leucine with L. mexicana promastigotes in the presence of ketoconazole gave 14alpha-methylergosta-8,24(24(1))-3beta-ol as the major sterol, which was shown by mass spectrometry to contain up to six atoms of (13)C per molecule. (13)C NMR analysis of the 14alpha-methylergosta-8,24(24(1))-3beta-ol revealed that it was labeled in only six positions: C-2, C-6, C-11, C-12, C-16, and C-23. This established that the leucine skeleton is incorporated intact into the isoprenoid pathway leading to sterol; it is not converted first to acetyl-CoA, as in animals and plants, with utilization of the acetyl-CoA to regenerate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA). An inhibitor of HMG-CoA synthase (L-659,699) blocked the incorporation of [1-(14)C]acetate into sterol but had no inhibitory effect on [U-(14)C]leucine incorporation. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin inhibited promastigote growth and [U-(14)C]leucine incorporation into sterol. The addition of unlabeled mevalonic acid (MVA) overcame the lovastatin inhibition of growth and also diluted the incorporation of [1-(14)C]leucine into sterol. These results are compatible with two routes by which the leucine skeleton may enter intact into the isoprenoid pathway. The catabolism of leucine could generate HMG-CoA that is then directly reduced to MVA for incorporation into sterol. Alternatively, a compound produced as an intermediate in leucine breakdown to HMG-CoA (e.g. dimethylcrotonyl-CoA) could be directly reduced to produce an isoprene alcohol followed by phosphorylation to enter the isoprenoid pathway post-MVA.", 
    "24": "Sterol synthesis by the mevalonate pathway is modulated, in part, through feedback-regulated degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR). In mammals, both a non-sterol isoprenoid signal derived from farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) and a sterol-derived signal appear to act together to positively regulate the rate of HMGR degradation. Although the nature and number of sterol-derived signals are not clear, there is growing evidence that oxysterols can serve in this capacity. In yeast, a similar non-sterol isoprenoid signal generated from FPP acts to positively regulate HMGR degradation, but the existence of any sterol-derived signal has thus far not been revealed. We now demonstrate, through the use of genetic and pharmacological manipulation of oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase, that an oxysterol-derived signal positively regulated HMGR degradation in yeast. The oxysterol-derived signal acted by specifically modulating HMGR stability, not endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in general. Direct biochemical labeling of mevalonate pathway products confirmed that oxysterols were produced endogenously in yeast and that their levels varied appropriately in response to genetic or pharmacological manipulations that altered HMGR stability. Genetic manipulation of oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase did result in the buildup of detectable levels of 24,25-oxidolanosterol by gas chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and NMR analyses, whereas no detectable amounts were observed in wild-type cells or cells with squalene epoxidase down-regulated. In contrast to mammalian cells, the yeast oxysterol-derived signal was not required for HMGR degradation in yeast. Rather, the function of this second signal was to enhance the ability of the FPP-derived signal to promote HMGR degradation. Thus, although differences do exist, both yeast and mammalian cells employ a similar strategy of multi-input regulation of HMGR degradation.", 
    "25": "1. Oxidative mechanisms have been implicated in neonatal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We and others have shown that a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor preserves endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity and inhibits cardiac hypertrophy in vivo. We therefore have examined whether noradrenaline (NA) induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during its induction of neonatal cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and whether simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, attenuates ROS production and thus NA-induced hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes. 2. NA increased the intracellular ROS levels in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase of ROS was significantly inhibited by simvastatin and catalase. Prazosin partially suppressed NA-induced increase of ROS and beating, while preincubation with both prazosin and propranolol completely abolished NA-evoked increase of ROS and beating. Simvastatin did not affect NA-induced increase of beating. 3. The NA-induced increase of protein content was partially suppressed by prazosin and completely abolished by preincubation with both prazosin and propranolol. Simvastatin inhibited the increase of NA-induced increase of RNA content and [(3)H]-leucine incorporation in a concentration-dependent manner. Mevalonic acid (MVA) reversed the inhibition of NA-induced RNA and protein increase by simvastatin. Catalase also inhibited the NA-induced increase of RNA and protein. 4. We conclude that the inhibitory effects of simvastatin on myocyte hypertrophy were associated with its antioxidant effects and inhibition of MVA-metabolism pathway in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. NA-induced increases of intracellular ROS and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy requires both alpha and beta adrenoceptors activation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The increases of ROS induced by NA is required for hypertrophy.", 
    "26": "Lovastatin reduces the isoprenylation of p21ras via suppression of mevalonic acid generation. Lovastatin has been shown to reduce tumor cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Here, the potential of lovastatin for purging leukemia cells from bone marrow was investigated using the myeloblastic cell lines K562 and KG-1 as a model system, derived from an erythroleukemia and an acute myelogenous leukemia, respectively. Optimal purging conditions were determined using an MTT proliferation and a leukemia colony assay. Elimination of leukemia cells was time- and dose-dependent. Depletion of K562 was 2.5 logs for 100 microM of lovastatin at 72 h of incubation. Compared to another purging agent, 100 microg/ml mafosfamide had an activity comparable to 100 mM lovastatin. Interestingly, KG-1 acute myelogenous leukemia cells were even more sensitive to lovastatin than K562 cells. In clonogenic assays, 100 microM of lovastatin resulted in a 3- to 4-log reduction of K562 colonies. Lovastatin had a progressive effect on normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. At a concentration of 100 microM of lovastatin, CFU-GM colonies were reduced by 1-2 logs. In conclusion, a differential effect on leukemia and normal progenitor cells could be detected in a clonogenic assay. These results suggest that lovastatin deserves further study as an agent for ex vivo marrow purging.", 
    "27": "Twenty subjects with mixed hyperlipidemia participated in a 3-arm crossover trial to evaluate the effectiveness of high-dose simvastatin as monotherapy. Significant reductions were observed in atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins.

    "28": "CVD morbidity and mortality is a major cause of premature death and allograft loss in recipients of renal and cardiac transplants, and hyperlipidemia--a major risk factor for CVD in the general population--may be a significant risk factor for CVD in transplant recipients. Hyperlipidemia is common after transplantation, and immunosuppression with corticosteroids, cyclosporine, or sirolimus causes posttransplantation hyperlipidemia. Posttransplantation hyperlipidemia can be treated in various ways, but statin therapy has thus far proved to be the most effective in lowering lipid levels in the transplant population. However, to date, no large solid end-point studies have demonstrated that lipid-lowering therapy with statins (or any other class of agents) significantly reduces CVD morbidity or mortality and improves allograft survival in transplant recipients, although some smaller studies point in that direction. The ongoing ALERT trial is currently studying whether early and later intervention with a statin (fluvastatin) can reduce chronic allograft dysfunction, decrease CVD, and improve patient survival in transplant recipients.", 
    "29": "The recent report on lipid lowering therapy from the Netherlands Health Council is largely in agreement with the 1998 guidelines made at the Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement CBO on the same topic. In addition to advice for a healthy life style and no smoking, lipid lowering therapy (particularly statins) is recommended in: patients with familial hyperlipidaemia; patients with atherosclerotic disease and a total cholesterol > 5.0 mmol/l; patients with diabetes and multiple risk factors including a total cholesterol > 5.0 mmol/l; other persons with markedly increased risk for development of coronary artery disease. The report does not dwell upon implementation and effects of the recommendations or on the question what preventive efforts are desirable for persons without manifest cardiovascular disease. In practice, prescribing the recommended medication is more successful than attempts to change the life style. The effects of multifactorial life style intervention may be considerable, however. The high social costs of cholesterol-lowering treatment should be regarded as an investment in health.",

Fluvastatin is an established 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (\"statin\") for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Its efficacy and safety have been established in numerous clinical trials. Emerging evidence now indicates that treatment with fluvastatin slows the progression of atherosclerotic CHD and reduces the incidence of cardiovascular morbimortality in the secondary prevention setting. This effect of fluvastatin cannot be explained by cholesterol lowering alone; nonlipid-related mechanisms (so-called \"pleiotropic effects\") undoubtedly contribute to a certain extent, and are probably linked to modulation of the mevalonate pathway. This review discusses the experimental evidence regarding the antiatherosclerotic and antithrombotic effects of fluvastatin that may contribute to its beneficial action on disease progression and clinical events. Such effects include decreased expression of adhesion molecules in monocytes and leucocyte-endothelium adherence responses, immunomodulation, prevention of low-density lipoprotein oxidation, inhibition of cholesterol esterification and accumulation, along with effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. Pleiotropic actions aimed at plaque stabilization (eg, decreased secretion of matrix metalloproteinases by macrophages), together with effects on platelet activity, tissue factor expression, and endothelial function, may contribute to an antithrombotic effect of fluvastatin. Taken together, the results of these studies indicate that the effects of fluvastatin, at therapeutic doses, may extend beyond cholesterol lowering.", 
    "31": "Cardiomyopathic hamsters develop heart disease early in life, which leads to congestive heart failure and death as these hamsters age. Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been reported to reduce ubiquinone concentrations and to deteriorate myocardial function in humans and in experimental animals. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors differ regarding their ability to penetrate extrahepatic tissues. As a consequence, lovastatin inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis at least 100-fold more effectively than pravastatin in extrahepatic cells. We examined the effect of lovastatin and pravastatin (approximately 10 mg per kilogram of body weight and per day mixed in the diet) compared with controls on the lifespan of cardiomyopathic hamsters (BIO 8262 strain) in the heart-failure period. In male hamsters, neither lovastatin nor pravastatin significantly affected survival. In female hamsters, lovastatin reduced median survival time from 89 days (control animals) to 30 days (P <.05); pravastatin (median survival, 115 days) had no statistically significant effect. We conclude that lovastatin, but not pravastatin, at a daily dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight significantly increases the mortality of cardiomyopathic hamsters. This effect may be the result of inhibition of myocardial ubiquinone supply.", 
    "32": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin have been associated with rhabdomyolysis in cardiac transplant recipients. Herein, we report a case of a 52-year-old male recipient of a cardiac transplant who developed rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure caused by simvastatin precipitated by multiple drug interactions.", 
    "33": "The patient had a history of cardiac transplantation (5 years before) and presented with a 2-day history of dark urine preceded by 2 weeks of diffuse myalgias. He had been maintained on cyclosporine throughout the entire post-transplant period. Simvastatin was added and pravastatin was discontinued 2 months before admission. Two weeks before the onset of muscle symptoms, digoxin and verapamil were started for new-onset atrial fibrillation. Creatinine phosphokinase levels peaked at 950,000 IU with serum creatinine of 3.3 mg/dL (baseline, 1.8 mg/dL).", 
    "34": "Review of the medication history indicates a temporal association between the addition of 3 drugs (simvastatin, verapamil, and digoxin) to the medication regimen already containing cyclosporine and the episode of rhabdomyolysis. All of these drugs are cytochrome P450 3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein substrates that are known from previous pharmacokinetic studies to individually produce substantial increases in levels of simvastatin.", 
    "35": "We believe this case illustrates that avoiding the use of drugs that are cytochrome P450 3A4 and/or P-glycoprotein substrates reduces the risk of rhabdomyolysis caused by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors.", 
    "36": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) secreted by macrophages in the artery wall exerts an important protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis, presumably through its ability to promote lipid efflux. Previous studies have shown that increases in cellular free cholesterol levels stimulate apoE transcription in macrophages and adipocytes; however, the molecular basis for this regulation is unknown. Recently, Taylor and colleagues [Shih, S. J., Allan, C., Grehan, S., Tse, E., Moran, C. & Taylor, J. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 31567-31572] identified two enhancers from the human apoE gene, termed multienhancer 1 (ME.1) and multienhancer 2 (ME.2), that direct macrophage- and adipose-specific expression in transgenic mice. We demonstrate here that the nuclear receptors LXRalpha and LXRbeta and their oxysterol ligands are key regulators of apoE expression in both macrophages and adipose tissue. We show that LXR/RXR heterodimers regulate apoE transcription directly, through interaction with a conserved LXR response element present in both ME.1 and ME.2. Moreover, we demonstrate that the ability of oxysterols and synthetic ligands to regulate apoE expression in adipose tissue and peritoneal macrophages is reduced in Lxralpha-/- or Lxrbeta-/- mice and abolished in double knockouts. Basal expression of apoE is not compromised in Lxr null mice, however, indicating that LXRs mediate lipid-inducible rather than tissue-specific expression of this gene. Together with our previous work, these findings support a central role for LXR signaling pathways in the control of macrophage cholesterol efflux through the coordinate regulation of apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1 expression.", 
    "37": "Responses to both an endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine 10(-9)-10(-5) mol/l) and an endothelium-independent vasodilator (sodium nitroprusside 10(-10)-10(-6) mol/l) were studied in aortic rings from rabbits fed or not with a diet containing 0.5% cholesterol plus 14% coconut oil for 14 weeks and treated or not with atorvastatin (2.5 mg/kg/day). Morphometric and ultrastructure analyses were also performed. Rabbits fed the dyslipidemic diet presented higher plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations than controls (P < 0.05). This was associated with intima-media thickening and, consequently, aortic stenosis (29 +/- 3%) since vessel cross-sectional area did not change. Endothelial cells presented numerous alterations in dyslipidemic rabbits. Atorvastatin treatment only reduced plasma levels in dyslipidemic rabbits (P < 0.05), which were nevertheless higher than those of controls. In addition, it prevented the reduction in acetylcholine relaxation in hypercholesterolemic animals. Atorvastatin administration also enhanced the response to acetylcholine in rabbits fed a control diet. Likewise, atorvastatin treatment reduced lesion area and consequently increased aortic lumen in dyslipidemic rabbits but did not modify media thickening. It also prevented the majority of the ultrastructural changes observed in endothelial cells. In conclusion, chronic atorvastatin treatment exerts a protective role in vascular function, structure and ultrastructure even in the presence of high cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels.",

    "43": "To develop a new approach to the treatment of primitive neuroectodermal tumors we evaluated the effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin on the Ewing's sarcoma cell line CHP-100. Lovastatin induced neural morphology and markers including neuron-specific enolase and neurofilament protein. The acquisition of neural morphology required new mRNA synthesis, and cDNA microarray analysis confirmed that lovastatin altered the program of gene expression. After morphologic differentiation the cells underwent rapidly progressive apoptosis. In normal development of neuronal progenitors, differentiation signals trigger p21WAF1 accumulation, RB hypophosphorylation, enhanced RB-E2F-1 association, and G1 arrest, and these events have been shown to protect from apoptosis. In contrast, in the Ewing's sarcoma cells lovastatin triggered differentiation without causing cell cycle arrest: p21WAF1 was not induced, RB remained hyperphosphorylated, and RB protein expression and RB-E2F-1 association were markedly downregulated, suggesting that loss of an RB-regulated G1 checkpoint promoted apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, adenoviral p21WAF1 decreased DNA synthesis and partially protected from lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity. The data demonstrate a new model for examining the genetic regulation of cell fate in a neural progenitor tumor and suggest a new approach to the treatment of this neoplasm.", 
    "44": "Recent evidence suggests that some benefit from the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors may occur independent of lipid lowering. We aimed to determine the effect of simvastatin on coronary endothelial function, endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression, and oxidative stress in experimental hypercholesterolemia (HC) in the absence of cholesterol lowering. Pigs were randomized to 3 experimental groups: normal diet (N group), high cholesterol diet (HC group), and HC diet with simvastatin (HC+S group) for 12 weeks. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol was similarly increased in the HC and HC+S groups compared with the N group. In vitro analysis of coronary large- and small-vessel endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was performed. The mean vasorelaxation of epicardial vessels to bradykinin was significantly attenuated in the HC group compared with the N group (32.3+/-1.2% versus 42.9+/-1.6%, respectively; P<0.0001). This attenuation was significantly reversed in the HC+S group (38.7+/-1.5%, P<0.005 versus HC group). The maximal vasorelaxation to substance P was significantly attenuated in the HC group compared with the N group (50.5+/-11.9% versus 79.3+/-5.3%, respectively; P<0.05). This attenuated response was normalized in the HC+S group (74.9+/-4.1%, P<0.05 versus HC group). The maximal arteriolar vasorelaxation to bradykinin was also significantly attenuated in the HC group compared with the N group (71.9+/-4.9% versus 96.8+/-1.34%, respectively; P<0.005). This was reversed in the HC+S group (98.4+/-0.6%, P<0.0001 versus HC group). Western blotting of coronary tissue homogenates for eNOS demonstrated a decrease in protein levels in the HC group compared with the N group, with normalization in the HC+S group. Elevation of plasma F(2)-isoprostanes and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, markers of oxidative stress, occurred in the HC compared with the N group. These changes were reversed in the HC+S group. In summary, simvastatin preserves endothelial function in coronary epicardial vessels and arterioles in experimental HC (in the absence of cholesterol lowering) in association with an increase in coronary eNOS levels and a decrease in oxidative stress. These alterations may play a role in the reduction in cardiac events after treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors.", 
    "45": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, such as simvastatin, lower circulating cholesterol levels and prevent myocardial infarction. Several studies have shown an unexpected effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on inflammation. Here, we confirm that simvastatin is anti-inflammatory by using a classic model of inflammation: carrageenan-induced foot pad edema. Simvastatin administered orally to mice 1 hour before carrageenan injection significantly reduced the extent of edema. Simvastatin was comparable to indomethacin in this model. To determine whether the anti-inflammatory activity of simvastatin might affect atherogenesis, simvastatin was tested in mice deficient in apoE. Mice were dosed daily for 6 weeks with simvastatin (100 mg/kg body wt). Simvastatin did not alter plasma lipids. Atherosclerosis was quantified through the measurement of aortic cholesterol content. Aortas from control mice (n=20) contained 56+/-4 nmol total cholesterol/mg wet wt tissue, 38+/-2 nmol free cholesterol/mg, and 17+/-2 nmol cholesteryl ester/mg. Simvastatin (n=22) significantly (P<0.02) decreased these 3 parameters by 23%, 19%, and 34%, respectively. Histology of the atherosclerotic lesions showed that simvastatin did not dramatically alter lesion morphology. These data support the hypothesis that simvastatin has antiatherosclerotic activity beyond its plasma cholesterol-lowering activity.", 
    "46": "SCH 48461, an inhibitor of gastrointestinal absorption of cholesterol, was evaluated for its effects on lipid parameters in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study. Following the baseline phase, which consisted of a 2- to 10-week drug washout and dietary stabilization phase and a 4-week placebo lead-in (placebo baseline phase), 190 patients were randomized to an 8-week double-blind active drug (SCH 48461 1, 6.25, 25, 100, 200, or 400 mg) or 40 mg lovastatin once daily each morning or placebo treatment phase. By week 2, patients who received SCH 48461 6.25 to 400 mg or lovastatin demonstrated greater reduction from baseline in directly measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels than patients in the placebo group (p < or = 0.03). Overall, the percent reductions in LDL-C from baseline increased as the dose of SCH 48461 increased, with 0.6% to 15.5% reductions from the minimum dose of 1 mg to the maximum dose of 400 mg. Lovastatin 40 mg/day reduced LDL-C by 30.7% (p < 0.01). Statistically significant decreases were also seen for total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apo B) with doses of 25 mg to 400 mg of SCH 48461 and lovastatin. SCH 48461 was well tolerated. There was a similar incidence of adverse events in each SCH 48461- or lovastatin-treated group compared to placebo.

Once clinical cardiovascular disease develops, these patients have a poorer prognosis than normoglycemic patients.

This form of diabetes, or the precursor state of insulin resistance, commonly occurs as a metabolic syndrome (formerly known as syndrome X) consisting of hypertension, atherogenic dyslipidemia and a procoagulant state, in addition to the disorder of glucose metabolism. All cardiovascular risk factors except smoking are more prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition to exercise, weight control, aspirin therapy and blood pressure control, therapy to modify lipid profiles is usually necessary.

It is unclear whether fibrate or statin therapy is more effective in these patients. We compared atorvastatin (10 mg/day) with fenofibrate (200 mg/day), each for 6 weeks separated by a 6-week washout period in 13 patients (5 men and 8 women; mean age 60.0+/-6.8 years; body mass index 30.0+/-3.0 kg/m2) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c 7.3+/-1.1%) and mixed hyperlipoproteinemia (LDL cholesterol 164.0+/-37.8 mg/dl, triglycerides 259.7+/-107 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 48.7+/-11.0 mg/dl) using a randomized, crossover design. Lipid profiles, LDL subfraction distribution, fasting plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, and fibrinogen concentrations were determined before and after each drug. Atorvastatin decreased all LDL subfractions (LDL cholesterol, -29%; p <0.01) including small, dense LDL. Fenofibrate predominantly decreased triglyceride concentrations (triglycerides, -39%; p <0.005) and induced a shift in LDL subtype distribution from small, dense LDL (-31%) to intermediate-dense LDL (+36%). The concentration of small, dense LDL was comparable during therapy to both drugs (atorvastatin 62.8+/-19.5 mg/dl, fenofibrate 63.0+/-18.1 mg/dl). Both drugs induced an increase in HDL cholesterol (atorvastatin +10%, p <0.05; fenofibrate +11%, p = 0.06). In addition, fenofibrate decreased fibrinogen concentration (-15%, p <0.01) associated with a decrease in plasma viscosity by 3% (p <0.01) and improved red cell aggregation by 15% (p <0.05), whereas atorvastatin did not affect any hemorheologic parameter.

    "65": "Hypercholesterolemia is a recognized risk factor for development of atherosclerosis in both native coronary arteries and bypass grafts. Lipid-lowering therapy with statins is effective. Few data are available for studies on bypass grafts. The influence of hypercholesterolemia on development of bypass graft disease was studied. Clinical and angiographic follow up 1yr after CABG of patients with a preoperative cholesterol >6.2mmol/l, with a preoperative lipid control (group 2) or controls (group 1) and patients with cholesterol <4.7mmol/l (group 3) were studied. Patient demographics, angiography and operation data were the same in all the groups. Group 1 patients had significantly higher incidence of graft lesions, requiring more interventions than Group 2. Sequential vein bypass grafts showed superior features compared to single vein grafts. Preoperative lipid control with statins is strongly recommended, since uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia has a direct impact on the outcome of CABG procedure. It significantly reduces the development of vein graft obstructive disease.", 
    "66": "A long-term follow-up study was made of three patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) associated with parkinsonism, two of whom were siblings. Besides typical CTX symptoms, all three patients showed severe parkinsonism. This observation has been rarely reported in CTX. The fact that the two siblings showed parkinsonism strongly suggests the genetic propensity to parkinsonism in these CTX patients. Positron emission tomography studies of the two patients revealed presynaptic dysfunction of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system. Treatment with the reductase inhibitor hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme successfully corrected the serum cholestanol level in the early stage of the disease, which, however, did not arrest the progression of clinical symptoms, particularly their parkinsonism. Clinically, levodopa had a little effect on parkinsonism, whereas an antihistamine drug, diphenylpyraline hydrochloride (DPP) had excellent effects on all three patients throughout the long-term follow up. The mechanism of the action of DPP on parkinsonism is unclear, however, the drug seems to be a therapeutic choice for treating parkinsonism in CTX.", 
    "67": "Several studies have previously reported high levels of total tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) antigen in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The relationship between serum lipid concentrations and total and free-form TFPI antigen in 32 patients with primary type II hypercholesterolemia and 38 age- and gender-matched normolipemic control subjects was studied (Study Group I). Plasma concentrations of total TFPI (tTFPI) antigen, free-form TFPI (fTFPI) antigen, tissue factor antigen, factor VII activity (FVIIc), and prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2) were measured. The median levels of tTFPI, fTFPI, FVIIc, and F1+2 were higher in hyperlipidemic patients compared with those in healthy subjects. The effect of lowering total cholesterol on hypercoagulability in 25 patients with type II hyperlipoproteinemia (Study Group II) were also studied. The median levels of tTFPI, FVIIc, and F1+2 decreased significantly after 6 months of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor therapy in the hypercholesterolemic patients. On the other hand, fTFPI did not change after therapy. Plasma tTFPI was strongly correlated with total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in hyperlipidemic patients. In contrast to the strong correlation between tTFPI and total cholesterol, the correlation between plasma fTFPI and total cholesterol was relatively poor. These results suggest that the activation of the anticoagulant system as well as the activation of the coagulation system may occur in association with hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, the results of this study may suggest that lowering of total cholesterol in hyperlipidemic patients reduces the thrombin generation in plasma and that down-regulation of LDL does not affect the anticoagulant potency of TFPI in plasma.", 
    "68": "Several studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of 3 hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on vascular properties, but little is known about treatment intensification. We compared patients in whom statins were started (INITIAL, n=30) for hypercholesterolaemia (>6.5 mmol l(-1)) with a matched patient group of long-time statin users, with similar baseline characteristics for lipids, intima-media thickness (IMT), and pulse wave velocity, in whom treatment with statins was intensified (LONG-TERM, n=54). At baseline and after 1 year, lipid profile, IMT of the carotid and femoral arteries, aortic distensibility using pulse-wave velocity and various properties of the peripheral vascular bed using a recently developed bio-impedance method were measured. After 1 year the relative changes in lipid profile were significantly better in the INITIAL compared with the LONG-TERM-group. The relative changes in IMT of the mean internal carotid and common femoral arteries significantly differed between the INITIAL and LONG-TERM-group (-8 and +11%, -11 and +22%, respectively). After 1 year, in both groups, most other vascular wall characteristics were unaltered compared with baseline. In conclusion, the beneficial structural alterations of the vascular wall were greater after starting than after intensifying already existing lipid-lowering treatment. This suggests that other effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors than lipid-lowering alone must be involved in vascular changes.", 
    "69": "Studies in vitro reveal that fluvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has a strong DPPH radical scavenging activity and achieves concentration-dependent inhibition of copper- and cell-induced oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). To further examine the anti-oxidative activity of fluvastatin in vivo, we elucidated the effects of chronic treatment with fluvastatin at a dose insufficient to reduce plasma cholesterol levels (2 mg/kg per day) on vasomotion and vascular oxidative stress in thoracic aortas of 0.5% cholesterol-fed rabbits. After 12 weeks of dietary treatment, aortic segments from rabbits fed cholesterol alone showed impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to acetylcholine and A23187 compared to normal chow-fed rabbits in association with a significant increase in plasma total cholesterol levels. In contrast, although plasma total cholesterol levels were not different from those in control cholesterol-fed rabbits, aortic segments from fluvastatin-treated rabbits showed normal relaxation. Compared with rabbits fed cholesterol alone, fluvastatin treatment decreased susceptibility of LDL to ex vivo copper-induced oxidation, reduced vascular superoxide generation, and atheromatous plaque formation. In conclusion, the potent anti-oxidative properties of fluvastatin in addition to its cholesterol-lowering activity appear to contribute to its anti-atherosclerotic effect in vivo.", 
    "70": "Hypercholesterolemia is causally associated with defects of endothelial nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation. Increased uptake of cholesterol by endothelial cells (ECs) upregulates the abundance of the structural protein caveolin-1 and impairs NO release through the stabilization of the inhibitory heterocomplex between caveolin-1 and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Therefore, we examined whether the hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor atorvastatin modulates caveolin abundance, eNOS activity, and NO release through a reduction in endogenous cholesterol levels.", 
    "71": "ECs were incubated with increasing doses of atorvastatin in the absence or in the presence of human LDL cholesterol (LDL-Chol) fractions in the presence of antioxidants. Our results show that atorvastatin (10 nmol/L to 1 micromol/L) reduced caveolin-1 abundance in the absence (-75%) and in the presence (-20% to 70%) of LDL-Chol. This was paralleled by a decreased inhibitory interaction between caveolin-1 and eNOS and a restoration and/or potentiation of the basal (+45%) and agonist-stimulated (+107%) eNOS activity. These effects were observed in the absence of changes in eNOS abundance and were reversed with mevalonate. In the presence of LDL-Chol, atorvastatin also promoted the agonist-induced association of eNOS and the chaperone Hsp90, resulting in the potentiation of eNOS activation.", 
    "72": "We provide biochemical and functional evidence that atorvastatin promotes NO production by decreasing caveolin-1 expression in ECs, regardless of the level of extracellular LDL-Chol. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in peripheral cells to correct NO-dependent endothelial dysfunction associated with hypercholesterolemia and possibly other diseases.",

Simvastatin therapy, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, seems to be a protective pharmacological agent against the higher oxidizability of LDL in plasma from ALD patients.", 
    "74": "There is experimental evidence that pravastatin, which is designed to inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, can affect cell metabolism and proliferation. We therefore studied the effects of pravastatin on the generation of inflammatory mediators in non-stimulated and stimulated primary human monocytes in vitro. In our experimental model, pravastatin induced a dose-dependent inhibition of monocyte cholesterol synthesis (up to 67%), up-regulation of low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA (by about 35%) and reduction in intracellular cholesterol accumulation. In parallel, exposure of non-stimulated monocytes to various doses of pravastatin resulted in inhibition of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 protein expression (up to 15-fold), reduction of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels (up to 2.4-fold) and a total loss of metalloproteinase-9 activity in stimulated cells. Pravastatin at concentrations of 5, 100 and 500 microM caused an inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced cellular oxygen consumption from 2. 4- to 5.5-fold. These data extend the findings of potential anti-inflammatory actions of statins and also suggest the possibility for pravastatin use in a broader spectrum of inflammatory situations.", 
    "75": "The LIPID study is a major trial of secondary prevention of coronary-heart-disease events that includes hospital admission with unstable angina (as well as myocardial infarction) as a qualifying event. In this substudy of LIPID, we compared subsequent cardiovascular risks and the effects of pravastatin in patients with previous unstable angina or previous myocardial infarction.", 
    "76": "3260 patients diagnosed with unstable angina and 5754 with acute myocardial infarction 3-36 months previously were randomly assigned 40 mg pravastatin daily or placebo over a mean of 6.0 years. The risk reduction of a range of cardiovascular events was estimated by means of the hazard ratio in Cox's proportional hazards model.", 
    "77": "Among patients assigned placebo, survival in the two diagnosis groups was similar. The relative risk reduction for mortality with pravastatin was 20.6% in the myocardial infarction group and 26.3% in the unstable angina group (p=0.55). Pravastatin significantly reduced the rates of all prespecified coronary endpoints in the myocardial infarction group. In patients with previous unstable angina, coronary heart disease mortality, total mortality, myocardial infarction, a need for coronary revascularisation, the number of admissions to hospital, and the number of days in hospital were significantly lower with pravastatin. Overall, hospital admission for unstable angina was the most common endpoint (24.6% of the placebo group; 22.3% of the pravastatin group).", 
    "78": "Patients who have survived acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina have a similar long-term prognosis, a high occurrence of subsequent unstable angina, and benefit similarly from therapy with pravastatin.",

Stepwise logistic regression identified the target LDL, baseline LDL, and baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) as significant predictors of achieving the target. The proportion of patients achieving their target LDL when that target was below 160, below 130, and 100 mg/dl or below was 64%, 32%, and 13% (p=0.004), respectively. Medical record review identified the reasons for not achieving target as incorrect drug regimen, inadequate lipid monitoring, and noncompliance.", 
    "85": "These results indicate that substantial numbers of patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy are not meeting NCEP-defined targets and that with increased drug monitoring and compliance, improvements in achieving NCEP target LDL levels could be realized.", 
    "86": "Rat HDL are known to increase testosterone production by cultured Leydig cells either following gonadotropin stimulation or cholesteryl ester depletion. However, rat HDL contain apolipoprotein E and have a high affinity for the members of the low density receptor family such as LDL receptor, LDL receptor related protein and VLDL receptor. In contrast with the adrenal cells, the contribution of apo A-I and apo E pathways in HDL cholesterol uptake has not been yet evidenced in rat Leydig cells. Recent data provided evidence that hCG stimulates scavenger receptor BI expression in testes. In order to investigate if testosterone production can be stimulated by apo E depleted HDL, we compared the level of testosterone stimulation by HDL with or without apo E first, in presence of saturating dose of hCG (1 IU/ml) and second, after depletion of cholesterol synthesis by pravastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. In presence of hCG, HDL with or without apo E increased testosterone production respectively by 37 and 25%. Pravastatin at 100 microg/ml inhibited the cholesterol synthesis and the testosterone production by 25% and decreased the cholesteryl content by 25%. The addition of HDL with or without apo E (50 microg protein HDL/ ml) completely overcame the depletion of cellular cholesteryl esters and the inhibition of testosterone production induced by pravastatin. In the presence of heparin, apo E depleted HDL overcame the testosterone production induced by pravastatin, indicating that uptake of HDL without apo E via a secretion of apo E by the cells themselves was not involved. Therefore, in absence of apo E, it is suggested that rat Leydig cells used HDL to regulate steroidogenesis via an apolipoprotein A-I pathway.", 
    "87": "Cerivastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolaemia. The lipid-lowering efficacy of cerivastatin has been demonstrated in a number of large multicentre, randomised clinical trials. Earlier studies used cerivastatin at relatively low dosages of < or =0.3mg orally once daily, but more recent studies have focused on dosages of 0.4 or 0.8 mg/day currently recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Along with modest improvements in serum levels of triglycerides and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, cerivastatin 0.4 to 0.8 mg/day achieved marked reductions in serum levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (33.4 to 44.0%) and total cholesterol (23.0 to 30.8%). These ranges included results of a pivotal North American trial in almost 1000 patients with hypercholesterolaemia. In this 8-week study, US National Cholesterol Education Program (Adult Treatment Panel II) [NCEP] target levels for LDL-cholesterol were achieved in 84% of patients randomised to receive cerivastatin 0.8 mg/day, 73% of those treated with cerivastatin 0.4 mg/day and <10% of placebo recipients. Among patients with baseline serum LDL-cholesterol levels meeting NCEP guidelines for starting pharmacotherapy, 75% achieved target LDL-cholesterol levels with cerivastatin 0.8 mg/day. In 90% of all patients receiving cerivastatin 0.8 mg/day, LDL-cholesterol levels were reduced by 23.9 to 58.4% (6th to 95th percentile). Various subanalyses of clinical trials with cerivastatin indicate that the greatest lipid-lowering response can be expected in women and elderly patients. Cerivastatin is generally well tolerated and adverse events have usually been mild and transient. The overall incidence and nature of adverse events reported with cerivastatin in clinical trials was similar to that of placebo. The most frequent adverse events associated with cerivastatin were headache, GI disturbances, asthenia, pharyngitis and rhinitis. In the large pivotal trial, significant elevations in serum levels of creatine kinase and transaminases were reported in a small proportion of patients receiving cerivastatin but not in placebo recipients. As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, rare reports of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occurred with cerivastatin, although gemfibrozil or cyclosporin were administered concomitantly in most cases. Postmarketing surveillance studies in the US have been performed. In 3 mandated formulary switch conversion studies, cerivastatin was either equivalent or superior to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including atorvastatin, in reducing serum LDL-cholesterol levels or achieving NCEP target levels. Pharmacoeconomic data with cerivastatin are limited, but analyses conducted to date in the US and Italy suggest that cerivastatin compares favourably with other available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in terms of its cost per life-year gained.", 
    "88": "Cerivastatin is a well tolerated and effective lipid-lowering agent for patients with hypercholesterolaemia. When given at dosages currently recommended by the FDA in the US, cerivastatin achieves marked reductions in serum levels of LDL-cholesterol, reaching NCEP target levels in the vast majority of patients. Thus, cerivastatin provides a useful (and potentially cost effective) alternative to other currently available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors as a first-line agent for hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "89": "The authors have developed a simple, rapid HPLC assay with ultraviolet (UV) detection for the analytical determination of lovastatin and its acid in human plasma for a concentration range of 100-5,000 ng/mL. Sample clean-up involved the use of C10 solid-phase extraction cartridges. Our limit of quantitation was 100 ng/mL. Standard curves were linear from 100 to 5,000 ng/mL, with a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.999 +/- 0.0002. Stored samples were stable at -70 degrees C for up to 4 months prior to reversed-phase HPLC analysis. This assay was able to measure steady-state lovastatin concentration (Css) at the initial dose level in a phase I trial of lovastatin as a modulator of apoptosis.", 
    "90": "Hypolipidaemic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment reduces cardiovascular risk and is also associated with the reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. However, there is scant data concerning the relationship between CRP and lipid changes during statin treatment. We studied 60 hypercholesterolaemic coronary patients who participated in the Treat to Target (3T) study comparing atorvastatin and simvastatin. Serum lipids and CRP (with a sensitive method) were measured before treatment at baseline and after 12 months of statin treatment. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was substantially decreased and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased during statin treatment. CRP decreased significantly (sign test P = 0.03) during treatment, and the changes of CRP were significantly associated with changes in HDL cholesterol (r = -0.45; P < 0.001) and apolipoprotein A1 (r = -0.40; P < 0.001) but not with changes in LDL cholesterol or triglycerides. The change in HDL cholesterol explained 20% of the change in CRP during statin treatment. The results are in line with previous suggestions that HDL has anti-inflammatory properties.", 
    "91": "A link has been suggested between blood lipids and hemostatic activation. Factor VII (FVII) is a coagulation factor which plays a pivotal role in fibrin generation and thrombus formation. Clinical trials have demonstrated that inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase greatly reduce cardiovascular events in patients with and without coronary artery disease but few data, at this time, are available on the effects of lipid-lowering treatment on factor VII levels. We studied thirty-six IIA and IIB type hyperlipidemic patients who, after a preliminary period of lipid-lowering diet, added atorvastatin (20 mg/daily) or continued dietary treatment alone until they achieved LDL-C recommended levels (<4 mmol/L). Four to six weeks of lipid lowering treatment with diet plus atorvastatin, produced a significant reduction in FVII coagulant activity (FVIIc) and antigen (FVIIAg). No significant changes were observed in activated FVII (FVIIa). The lipid-lowering treatment with diet alone induced an improved lipid pattern, but no significant changes in FVII profile. Our study suggests a significant effect of lipid-lowering treatment on FVII levels. A possibile nonlipid mechanism that modifies FVII pathway may be suggested.", 
    "92": "Low HDL cholesterol levels have been found to be a risk factor for CAD. To date, the focus of treating hyperlipidemia has been on lowering LDL cholesterol levels. Now, as more and more compelling data are reported, it is time to begin focusing more energy on how to raise HDL cholesterol levels. If exercise, smoking cessation, and moderate alcohol consumption fail to achieve HDL cholesterol goals, niacin, fibric acid derivatives, or statin drugs may prove helpful in patients at high risk of CAD.", 
    "93": "At this juncture, many important questions still need to be answered about the prevention and treatment of CAD in women. It is clear that modification of traditional risk factors, including treatment of hypertension, cessation of smoking, and treatment of hypercholesterolemia, can lead to a decrease in coronary events and, hopefully, in total mortality in women. Both statin drugs and estrogen replacement therapy offer benefits in many instances. For now, use of HRT remains a personal decision that every postmenopausal woman needs to carefully consider and discuss with her physician.", 
    "94": "It is now widely accepted that atherosclerosis is a complex multicellular process involving oxidation of cholesterol and the intracellular accumulation of oxidized cholesterol. This accumulation causes a cascade of inflammatory processes, resulting in an unstable atherosclerotic plaque that ultimately bursts, causing myocardial infarction. Botanical dietary supplements (herbs) can ameliorate this process and prevent cardiovascular disease at many steps in the process. Many herbs have antioxidant activity and can reduce low-density lipoprotein oxidation. Some phytosterols found in botanicals can inhibit cholesterol absorption. After a brief review of herbs being promoted for achieving and maintaining healthy cholesterol levels, the evidence and future prospects for Chinese red yeast rice, the main component of dietary supplements with HMG-CoA reductase inhibiting activity, are discussed in detail. Initial phase II clinical trials are highly encouraging. This herb is likely to be able to directly impact the process of atherosclerosis, but large-scale clinical trials are needed to assess the public health potential of this herbal supplement.", 
    "95": "Clinical trials have shown that 3-hydoxy-3- methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, known as statins, significantly reduce the risk of both primary and secondary coronary heart disease events. Although these trials have included few women, the evidence suggests that statins are as effective in women as in men. The addition of hormone replacement therapy to statin therapy augments lowering of low- density lipoprotein cholesterol, but may not increase the favorable effects on clinical events achieved with statins alone. Finally, new data suggest that statins may also reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures, a provocative finding still in need of verification by clinical trials.", 
    "96": "Children have been tested and treated for hypercholesterolemia for more than 30 years. Although most treatment regimens have been limited to dietary intervention, statin use is increasing. Statins have been used in children since 1987, but published sources have only reported on small numbers of children with severe hypercholesterolemia. The available data indicates that statins can be useful and well tolerated. New data will be available in the next few years that will lead to the wider use of these drugs. Although statin drugs have proven to be safe in the adult population, physicians will be obliged to follow pediatric patients closely when these agents are widely used in the first few years. The use of highly effective safe drugs such as statins will allow for the assessment of the best time to initiate therapy in younger populations and what benefits may be found over the long term.", 
    "97": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. Among the many factors that are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients, dyslipidemia plays a major role. It is characterized by an increase in triglycerides, a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and normal or mildly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The management of patients with diabetic dyslipidemia is difficult because we lack studies specifically designed for diabetic patients. Thus, strategy has to rely on post hoc analyses of landmark intervention trials, which usually include only a small number of diabetic patients, or on rare trials enrolling small cohorts of diabetic patients. When lifestyle changes fail, monotherapy should be tried first with either a statin or a fibrate, depending on triglyceride level. If lipid target values are not reached, a combination therapy can then be initiated, with close follow-up of potential side effects.", 
    "98": "The need for greater reductions in LDL cholesterol, although remaining to be proven as clinically beneficial, continues to drive the development of either higher doses of currently approved and marketed statins or the development of new, more effective agents.", 
    "99": "Five years ago, many critics questioned the value of lipid-lowering therapy. Today, the clinical benefits of statins are well documented, but the challenge remains to fully implement these benefits across the wide spectrum of the at-risk population, and continue to advance our understanding regarding the potential for the benefits of statins across an even broader range of select patient populations.", 
    "100": "Obstructive coronary artery disease is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Our understanding of the pathobiology of coronary atherosclerosis provides us with new opportunities to reduce myocardial ischemia by interventions that address these mechanisms directly. These interventions include lipid-lowering therapies that improve local coronary vasomotion, inflammation, and the procoagulant state. These interventions have also been shown to result in important reductions in clinical events, including angina pectoris, myocardial ischemia and infarction, and death. Ambulatory electrocardiography provides a versatile and quantifiable measure of regional myocardial ischemia. Reductions in ischemia, as quantified by this diagnostic modality, are associated with improved clinical outcomes that may reflect improvements in the cellular pathophysiology of coronary atherosclerosis. This review discusses new information regarding the interactions between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the cell biology of atherosclerosis, and the activity of ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "101": "Medical therapy reduces myocardial infarction and death in patients with stable coronary heart disease (CHD). In contrast, there is little evidence available to evaluate the impact of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on hard endpoints in such patients. Four randomized, controlled trials have compared PCI with medical therapy. These studies have demonstrated that PCI results in an improvement in angina and exercise tolerance compared with medical therapy, but they also suggest that medical therapy may be preferable to PCI with respect to the risk of cardiac events. Interpretation of these studies has been limited by small sample size, exclusion of high-risk subjects, no or reduced use of stents, lack of a cost- effectiveness evaluation, and absence of risk factor intervention (except for Atorvastatin versus Revascularization Treatment, which used aggressive low-density lipoprotein lowering with atorvastatin in the medical group only). The Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial will permit better definition of the role of PCI in the treatment of stable or recently stabilized patients with CHD.", 
    "102": "The advent of statin therapy has revolutionized the ability of the clinician to manage patients at risk for the development of an ischemic event due to dyslipidemia. Large-scale clinical trials involving thousands of patients in both primary and secondary prevention have clearly demonstrated that statin therapy will reduce cardiovascular mortality across a broad spectrum of patient subgroups. Additionally, in adequately powered trials, total mortality has been successfully decreased by the use of statin therapy. However, the precise mechanism underlying the benefit of statin therapy has been controversial due to the multiplicity of potential benefits that statins have demonstrated in addition to pure lipid lowering. The causal theory of pharmacologic benefit reiterates the lipid hypothesis, which states that dyslipidemia is central to the process of atherosclerosis and the clinical benefit which accrues from statin therapy is a function of the degree of lipid lowering. The noncausal theory supports the premise that clinical benefits are related primarily to pleiotropic effects of statins (endothelial function, inflammation, coagulation and plaque vulnerability) as being the major modulators of clinical benefit. This review will focus on the potential beneficial effects of statin therapy on a number of the pleiotropic effects of statins and the potential role that these activities play in the reduction of risk for ischemic events.", 
    "103": "Coronary heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Although coronary heart disease and stroke entail very expensive therapies and extensive hospital utilization, the cost of preventive measures is also quite expensive. In this review, the factors that determine the cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease are discussed. A risk-based strategy for the selection of patients seems to provide cost-effective utilization of this potent treatment strategy. Appropriate patient selection should be accompanied by aggressive measures to improve utilization and compliance through improved physician and patient education.", 
    "104": "Serum cholesterol traditionally has been considered a poor predictor of total stroke risk; however, it is associated positively with ischemic stroke risk and associated negatively with hemorrhagic stroke risk. Although studies failed to demonstrate stroke reduction using older cholesterol-lowering medications, recent study of the statin class of medications shows both consistent stroke and other cardiovascular benefits. Ischemic stroke and coronary heart disease share similar underlying mechanisms, likely explaining much of the therapeutic benefit from statins. Current research is directed at further determining groups of patients most likely to benefit from lipid reduction in stroke prevention. In the interim, patients with established atherosclerosis should be treated with a statin to achieve a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dL.", 
    "105": "Two recently published clinical endpoint trials, Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program High-density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) and Atorvastatin Versus Revascularization Treatment (AVERT), studied lipid populations and clinical subgroups not previously evaluated in prior trials. VA-HIT, which used gemfibrozil, resurrected the potential benefits of fibrates in atherosclerotic subjects after previous trials either showed nonsignificant reductions in coronary artery disease (CAD) events or raised questions regarding non-CAD events. This study also raised intriguing questions about mechanisms and reinvigorated the triglyceride-atherothrombotic debate. The latest statin trial, AVERT, helped move the potential use of statins in two directions, addressing whether more LDL-cholesterol reduction is better, and whether lipid lowering offers an alternative to revascularization in certain subgroups. Finally, the design or initiation of a number of innovative and potentially landmark statin, fibrate, or combination studies has been published, or their results made public. The focus is on current gaps in our knowledge as we move toward evidence-based medicine. These include primary and secondary prevention of CAD in the elderly, primary prevention of CAD in persons with diabetes, and primary prevention of stroke.", 
    "106": "Effective treatment of dyslipidemia improves prognosis. Statin therapy has been documented to decrease the cardiovascular event rate in the setting of elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease, but most patients are not treated to the target (LDL <or=100 mg/dL) set by the National Cholesterol Education Program. The triglyceride level is also being increasingly recognized as an important mediator in the process of progressive atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Studies suggest the target level for triglycerides should be the same as for LDL cholesterol levels-- no more than 100 mg/dL. In order to achieve these LDL and triglyceride levels, combination therapy is required frequently. Probably the most effective combination for mixed dyslipidemia is a statin with niacin. The use of adjunctive omega-3 supplementation also should be considered especially for patients with elevated triglyceride levels. Other adjunctive agents including sitostanol ester (in the form of a margarine) and a well-tolerated second generation bile acid sequestrant that will lower LDL cholesterol an additional 10% to 18% and will be available soon.", 
    "107": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of death in the United States. Fibrous plaques develop in 77% to 78% of men before age 30. The mean low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level in men aged 25 to 30 years is 117 mg/dL. In the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study, lovastatin therapy was associated with a 40% reduction in risk of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The reduction in risk of myocardial infarction was independent of baseline LDL-C level with baseline LDL-C levels as low as 125 mg/dL. The National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines should be simplified by recommending that LDL-C levels be less than 100 mg/dL in all adults in the United States.", 
    "108": "Hypertriglyceridemia is now recognized as an independent risk factor of coronary artery disease (CAD). A recent secondary prevention study of CAD with a statin suggested that it may be prudent to target fasting triglycerides to less than 150 mg/dL. Secondary prevention trials of CAD with drugs acting primarily on triglycerides (fibrates) have shown that reducing triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, without significantly affecting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol slows down coronary artery luminal narrowing (Lopid Coronary Angiography Trial [LOCAT], Bezafibrate Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial [BECAIT], Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention [BIP]). Furthermore, Veterans Administration-HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) and Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto-1 (GISSI) studies recently showed that gemfibrozil and fish oils, respectively, decreased CAD mortality in secondary prevention trials. Statins are also capable of significantly reducing high triglyceride levels. Further clinical studies are necessary to confirm in terms of mortality the beneficial effect of reducing triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in secondary CAD prevention; whereas, in primary prevention the beneficial effect of drastically reducing triglycerides by the way of pharmacology needs to be proved.", 
    "109": "Reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol represent an important risk factor for the development and progression of coronary artery disease. In recent years, clinical outcome studies have verified that statin therapy may reduce the risk of initial or recurrent cardiovascular events in subjects with elevated or \"normal\" cholesterol levels. Subgroup analysis has also revealed that patients with low HDL benefit from this therapy. Two recently presented outcome trials using fibrate therapy also demonstrated a potential role for these medications in subjects with low HDL. The use of various HDL raising agents, singly or in combination on arteriographic progression and their potential mechanisms of action are reviewed. The latter may be an important consideration in the treatment of high-risk patients with low HDL.", 
    "110": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is multifactorial, and its manifestation is determined by multiple gene loci and their interaction with a cohort of environmental factors. Variation at several candidate gene loci has already been shown to have a significant effect over the spectrum of plasma lipid levels observed in the population. Moreover, some variants are known to influence the interindividual variability in response to dietary and pharmacologic interventions aimed to reduce atherogenic lipoproteins. The continuous progress in this area of research is getting us closer to the development of genetic screening panels that will allow a more precise assessment of individual CHD risk and response to therapeutic interventions.", 
    "111": "The management of hyperlipidemia in the elderly patient is a major problem, given the frequency of dyslipidemias and cardiovascular disorders in this age group. Therapy must take current uncertainties into account and, in the absence of therapeutic studies carried out in the elderly, is typically based upon a case-by-case approach. Raised cholesterol levels remain a significant risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in the elderly. Although the relative risk of CHD tends to diminish with increasing age, this reduction is accompanied by an increase in absolute risk (ie, the number of events) as the frequency of the illness increases markedly with age. The results of major outcome studies with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), when analyzed according to patient age, indicate that the benefits of these agents are not merely confined to younger individuals. However, the elderly form a unique patient population--the proportion of women is greater and the profile of cardiovascular illnesses is characterized, among others, by a greater incidence of cerebrovascular accidents. Problems relating to poor tolerability and comorbidity (which may give rise to drug-drug interactions) also occur more frequently in this age group. Moreover, the potential widespread treatment of hyperlipidemia in the elderly has profound economic implications. Under these circumstances, the clinical practice recommendations depend upon a reasonable extrapolation of epidemiologic and therapeutic data obtained from middle-aged men. At present, treatment is therefore aimed at patients with the most severe forms of hyperlipidemia, generally in the secondary prevention setting, taking into account the patient's life expectancy. The results of ongoing studies will determine the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy for primary prevention of CHD in the elderly.", 
    "112": "Traditional treatment of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease by cardiovascular specialists, which has focused on \"critical\" stenoses, may be less effective in reducing morbidity and mortality than therapies that stabilize plaques and reduce thrombosis and sudden death. Recent data from clinical trials of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy and modification of dietary fat composition demonstrate that both these approaches can reduce clinical events. Although revascularization therapy is effective in reducing angina caused by high-grade stenotic lesions, this therapy is incomplete because the more-numerous \"smaller\" plaques that typically cause clinical events remain untreated. Two recent trials suggest that statin therapy may have benefits on stabilizing plaques in high-risk patients within a year. Additional benefit may also be provided by increasing dietary consumption of monounsaturated or omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Both statin therapy and diets high in monounsaturated or omega-3 fatty acids appear to improve morbidity and mortality by modifying the underlying atherothrombotic disease process.", 
    "113": "Clinical trials of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy have demonstrated improvement in coronary atherosclerosis progression and reduction in risk of cardiovascular events. However, improvement in cardiovascular end-points is incompletely explained by the baseline or treated LDL cholesterol level. The beneficial effects of statins on clinical events may involve nonlipid mechanisms that modify hemostasis. Local activation of platelets and thrombus formation adjacent to atheromatous plaques, especially where ruptured or eroded, are now recognized to be of pathophysiological importance in the acute and chronic clinical expression of coronary heart disease. Thus, favorable effects of statins on hemostasis may be relevant to decreasing or delaying the progression and clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis.", 
    "114": "Apolipoprotein E (apo E) is important in plasma lipid metabolism and is a component of several plasma lipoprotein-lipid particles. Three major apo E isoforms are encoded by three common alleles at the APO E locus. The E2 allele is associated with lower and the E4 allele with higher total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels compared with the E3 allele. Available data generally indicate that APO E2, and possibly E3, genotype individuals reduce plasma total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels more than APO E4 individuals with statin therapy. Some evidence also indicates that APO E2 individuals are more likely to respond favorably to gemfibrozil and cholestyramine. On the other hand, it appears that with probucol, APO E4 genotype individuals may improve plasma lipoprotein-lipid profiles more than APO E3 individuals. APO E2 and E3 genotype perimenopausal women appear to improve plasma lipoprotein-lipid profiles more with hormone replacement therapy than APO E4 women. On the other hand, low-fat diet interventions tend to reduce plasma LDL cholesterol and, perhaps, plasma total cholesterol levels more in APO E4 than in APO E2 or E3 individuals. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies generally indicate that APO E2 and E3 individuals improve plasma lipoprotein-lipid profiles more with exercise training than APO E4 individuals. Although these data are hardly definitive, they lend strong support for the possibility that in the near future individuals will be directed to what might be their optimal therapy for improving plasma lipoprotein-lipid profiles and cardiovascular disease risk based partially on APO E genotype."
