The P2Y1 receptor was found to be involved in i) the centralization of secretory granules elicited by ADP, ii) the formation of filopodia induced by released ADP in weakly activated platelets and iii) actin polymerization and the cytoskeletal translocation of cdc42, rac1 and rhoA, in an integrin alphaIIbbeta3 dependent manner, in ADP-stimulated platelets. In contrast, the P2YT receptor was shown i) to be essential for the formation of stable macroaggregates, ii) to enhance actin polymerization and the cytoskeletal translocation of small GTPases, probably through amplification of platelet aggregation, and iii) not to be involved in the early steps of platelet activation since its blockade did not affect the cytoskeletal translocation of rhoA.", 
    "1": "Employing high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry, we describe a new assay for monitoring 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. Incubations were carried out with HMG-CoA reductase (rat liver), HMG-CoA and NADPH, and terminated by the addition of HCl. The reaction product, mevalonolactone, and internal standard, were extracted with ethyl acetate, dissolved in methanol, and analyzed by LC-MS. Using an isocratic mobile phase of 10% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid (flow-rate, 0.2 ml/min), the protonated molecules of mevalonolactone at m/z 131 and internal standard, beta,beta-dimethyl-gamma-(hydroxymethyl)-gamma-butyrolactone, at m/z 145, were detected using selected ion monitoring. The limit of detection was approximately 6.5 pg, and the limit of quantitation was approximately 16.3 pg. Extraction recovery was >90%. The relative standard deviations for intra- and inter-day assays were approximately 4.1+/-2.7 and 9.4+/-3.4%, respectively. Mevalonolactone was examined over a period of 3 days and found to be stable. Using this assay, lovastatin and mevastatin inhibited HMG-CoA reductase activity with IC50 values 0.24+/-0.02 and 2.16+/-0.31 microM, respectively. These methods offer some advantages over those reported previously which employ radiolabeled substrate and products, and should be useful in searching for compounds that could lower serum cholesterol or alter cell growth and differentiation.", 
    "2": "Atorvastatin (Lipitor, Pfizer) is a safe and effective 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin). It is the most potent currently available statin in terms of lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol levels. It was the first statin shown to lower triglycerides in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridaemia. It has a good safety profile. In common with other statins, it has non-lipid-lowering effects including improving endothelial function, antiproliferative actions on smooth muscle and reducing platelet aggregation. It also has anti-inflammatory effects and may reduce plasma glucose levels. Clinical trial evidence with this statin is currently limited. It did slightly reduce events in the AVERT trial comparing patients receiving coronary angioplasty with those receiving high-dose atorvastatin therapy and in the MIRACL study reduced ischemia in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Other end point trials are in progress.", 
    "3": "Hypercholesterolaemia is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis which, in turn, underlies most ischaemic heart disease (IHD). This review deals briefly with the pathophysiology of lipids in humans and follows with a discussion of current lipid-lowering therapies. In those patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina, appropriate lipid-lowering therapy has been convincingly shown to reduce not only cardiac events but also overall mortality. The advent of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors in the late 1980s has had a revolutionary impact in the clinical management of hypercholesterolaemia, not only because of their efficacy but especially because they are well-tolerated. The use of other treatments such as the fibrates and bile acid resins are also discussed. Given the successful use of the statins, it is felt that an emergence of a different class of LDL-cholesterol lowering compound is unlikely in the near future and rather that compounds which can increase HDL-cholesterol while lowering LDL will be of greater impact. There may also be a shifting trend towards such naturally occurring compounds as plant stanols and phytoestrogens.",

Simvastatin potently lowers total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Simvastatin was the first cholesterol-lowering agent that reduced total mortality in a randomised clinical trial. Simvastatin is effective at reducing total mortality, myocardial infarction, coronary mortality and the incidence of stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin, like other statins, also has non-lipid mechanisms of action. These include anti-inflammatory effects, antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells and an upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Overall, simvastatin has an excellent safety profile. Simvastatin, along with other statins, has made a significant impact on the morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease.", 
    "5": "Fluvastatin sodium (Lescol, Novartis Pharmaceutical Corp., East Hanover, NJ, U.S.A.), a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitor that limits cholesterol biosynthesis, is available as a 40-mg immediate-release formulation capsule. An extended-release formulation for once-daily administration has been developed for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia who may benefit from doses higher than 40 mg/day. This phase I study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a new fluvastatin extended-release formulation at doses ranging from 80-640 mg/day in 40 hypercholesterolemic patients. After a 2-week dietary stabilization phase, patients (Fredrickson type IIa/IIb), 18-55 years of age, were randomly assigned to four groups to receive oral fluvastatin extended-release (80, 160, 320, or 640 mg) or matching placebo once daily for 13 days. Fluvastatin extended-release was generally safe and well tolerated at doses of 80-320 mg/day. Within this dose range, linear pharmacokinetics was observed after single and multiple dosing. At 640 mg, fluvastatin extended-release was not well tolerated. Six of the seven actively treated patients at this dose experienced adverse events, including diarrhea, headache, and clinically relevant elevations in serum transaminase concentrations. In addition, nonlinear pharmacokinetics, possibly due to saturation of first-pass metabolism, was observed at this dose, causing higher than expected serum drug concentrations. Once-daily administration of fluvastatin extended-release at doses of 80-320 mg/day was generally safe and well tolerated in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia over a 13-day dosing period.", 
    "6": "We examined the effect of fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on the production of hydroxyl radical (*OH) generation via nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activation by an in vivo microdialysis technique. The microdialysis probe was implanted in the left ventricular myocardium of anesthetized rats and tissue was perfused with Ringer's solution through the microdialysis probe at a rate of 1 microl/min. Sodium salicylate in Ringer's solution (0.5 nmol/microl/min) was infused directly through a microdialysis probe to detect the generation of *OH. Induction of [K(+)](o) (70 mM) or tyramine (1 mM), significantly increased the formation of *OH trapped as 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA). The application of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a NOS inhibitor, significantly decreased the K(+) depolarization-induced *OH formation, but the effect of tyramine significantly increased the level of 2,3-DHBA. When fluvastatin (100 microM), an inhibitor of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, was administered to L-NAME-pretreated animals, both KCl and tyramine failed to increase the level of 2,3-DHBA formation. The effect of fluvastatin may be unrelated to K(+) depolarization-induced *OH generation. To examine the effect of fluvastatin on ischemic/reperfused rat myocardium, the heart was subjected to myocardial ischemia for 15 min by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). When the heart was reperfused, a marked elevation of the level of 2,3-DHBA was observed. However, in the presence of fluvastatin (100 microM), the elevation of 2,3-DHBA was not observed in ischemia/reperfused rat heart. Fluvastatin, orally at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks, significantly blunted the rise of serum creatine phosphokinase and improved the electrocardiogram 2 h after coronary occlusion. These results suggest that fluvastatin is associated with a cardioprotective effect due to the suppression of noradrenaline-induced *OH generation by inhibiting LDL oxidation in the heart.", 
    "7": "Recent studies have suggested that inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (statins) can play a role in protection against vascular risk, which is independent of cholesterol reduction. It could act by inhibiting the synthesis of isoprenoids (farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP)), which are respectively essential for membrane attachment and biological activity of GTPases Ras and RhoA. This study demonstrates that a statin (cerivastatin) inhibits angiogenesis. This effect was due to a decrease in endothelial cell locomotion which was reversed by GGPP. It was mainly related to delocalization of RhoA from cell membrane to cytoplasm, responsible for the disorganization of actin stress fibers. Furthermore, a decrease in MMP-2 secretion, involved in cell invasion, was also observed. This effect is rather due to Ras inhibition as it was reversed by FPP. This anti-angiogenic activity could explain the beneficial effect of statins on atherosclerosis and on cancer prevention as shown by clinical studies.",

In the present study, we found that NK-104, a new potent synthetic inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, reduced osteopontin expression both at protein and mRNA levels in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. 3. The inhibitory effect of NK-104 was almost completely reversed by mevalonate, suggesting that mevalonate or its metabolites play important roles in the regulation of osteopontin expression. 4. Furthermore, oral administration of NK-104 (3 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 7 days) effectively suppressed abnormally upregulated expression of osteopontin mRNA in the aorta and kidney of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. 5.

    "24": "The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is a key regulator in cholesterol biosynthesis and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have become a widely prescribed family of lipid lowering agents. Cholesterol synthesis occurs predominantly in liver which is the target organ of statins. We studied the effects of fluvastatin (Lescol), a member of the statin family, on hepatic protein regulation. Male F344 rats treated with 0.8 mg/kg per day fluvastatin or 24 mg/kg per day fluvastatin for 7 days showed treatment-related changes in 58 liver proteins (P<0.005). Major effects were evident in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway including the induction of enzymes upstream and downstream of the target enzyme HMG CoA reductase. Treatment also triggered alterations in key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism and was associated with changes in a heterogeneous set of cellular stress proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure, calcium homeostasis and protease activity. The latter set of protein alterations indicates that hepatotoxicity is associated with high-dose treatment. Based on the results it is suggested that HMG-CoA synthase and isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase may be explored as alternative drug targets and that the induction levels of these enzymes may serve as a measure of potency of individual statin drugs. It is proposed that efficacy and cellular stress markers discovered in this study may be used in a high throughput screen (HTS) assay format to compare efficiently and accurately the therapeutic windows of different members of the statin family.", 
    "25": "We have recently reported that the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) through specific protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms is required for basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced proliferation of coronary smooth muscle cells (cSMC). In this study, we investigated the effects of the 3hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin on bFGF-induced signal transduction in cSMC. The present study shows that lovastatin inhibits bFGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in cSMC, and that this inhibition is reversed by mevalonate (50 micromol/l) and by geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (1-5 micromol/l). Although lovastatin prevented Ras farnesylation the amount of bFGF-stimulated MAPK phosphorylation decreased only partially after lovastatin treatment. In addition, lovastatin pretreatment resulted in a sustained phosphorylation of MAPK. We observed a dose-dependent lovastatin-dependent increase in PKC activity, which could be prevented by mevalonate. This increase was comparable to the one induced by calyculin A (2 nmol/l), an inhibitor of protein phosphatase PP-1 and PP-2A. Lovastatin inhibited the expression of the PP-1 protein, which is involved in bFGF-induced DNA synthesis in cSMC. Thus, our data suggest that, lovastatin possibly affects the dephosphorylation processes of PKC and MAPK by inhibition of PP-1/PP-2A protein phosphatases which are involved in the bFGF-induced mitogenesis in cSMC.",

Conversely, myoglobinuria had no effect. Isolated CE increments were observed in ATP-depleted HK-2 cells. Neither mevastatin nor progesterone blocked this CE accumulation. Plasma membrane injury induced with sphingomyelinase or cholesterol oxidase, but not with phospholipase A(2) or cytochalasin B, increased tubule CE content. High CE levels, induced with cholesterol oxidase, partially blocked hypoxic PTS attack.",

    "57": "Different tissues display distinct sensitivities to defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Tissues highly dependent on oxygen such as the cardiac muscle, skeletal and smooth muscle, the central and peripheral nervous system, the kidney, and the insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cell are especially susceptible to defective OXPHOS. There is evidence that defective OXPHOS plays an important role in atherogenesis, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and aging. Defective OXPHOS may be caused by abnormal mitochondrial biosynthesis due to inherited or acquired mutations in the nuclear (n) or mitochondrial (mt) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). For instance, the presence of a mutation of the mtDNA in the pancreatic beta-cell impairs adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation and insulin synthesis. The nuclear genome controls mitochondrial biosynthesis, but mtDNA has a much higher mutation rate than nDNA because it lacks histones and is exposed to the radical oxygen species (ROS) generated by the electron transport chain, and the mtDNA repair system is limited. Defective OXPHOS may be caused by insufficient fuel supply, by defective electron transport chain enzymes (Complexes I - IV), lack of the electron carrier coenzyme Q10, lack of oxygen due to ischemia or anemia, or excessive membrane leakage, resulting in insufficient mitochondrial inner membrane potential for ATP synthesis by the F0F1-ATPase. Human tissues can counteract OXPHOS defects by stimulating mitochondrial biosynthesis; however, above a certain threshold the lack of ATP causes cell death. Many agents affect OXPHOS. Several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit or uncouple OXPHOS and induce the 'topical' phase of gastrointestinal ulcer formation. Uncoupled mitochondria reduce cell viability. The Helicobacter pylori induces uncoupling. The uncoupling that opens the membrane pores can activate apoptosis. Cholic acid in experimental atherogenic diets inhibits Complex IV, cocaine inhibits Complex I, the poliovirus inhibits Complex II, ceramide inhibits Complex III, azide, cyanide, chloroform, and methamphetamine inhibit Complex IV. Ethanol abuse and antiviral nucleoside analogue therapy inhibit mtDNA replication. By contrast, melatonin stimulates Complexes I and IV and Gingko biloba stimulates Complexes I and III. Oral Q10 supplementation is effective in treating cardiomyopathies and in restoring plasma levels reduced by the statin type of cholesterol-lowering drugs.", 
    "58": "In phase 1 of this hyperlipidemia outcomes management program, characteristics of 7,619 patients treated with statins at 27 US managed care plans were determined. Nearly 40% (3,018 patients) had documented coronary heart disease (CHD). Most (65%) had at least two CHD risk factors. Hyperlipidemia treatment included simvastatin (39%), atorvastatin (25%), fluvastatin (14%), pravastatin (12%), and lovastatin (2%). On-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were available for 79% of patients; however, only 46% had both baseline and follow-up levels recorded in their charts. Of patients for whom follow-up data were available, 3,779 (63%) achieved their target LDL-C levels as recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). Target LDL-C levels were reached by 1,381 (87%) of the patients with a goal of 160 mg/dL, 1,326 (65%) of those with a goal of 130 mg/dL, and 1,072 (44%) of those with a goal of 100 mg/dL. Overall, 66% of patients who met their treatment goal and 24% of those who did not required no more than a 25% reduction in LDL-C. In contrast, 8% of patients who achieved goals and 36% of patients who did not required >40% reduction in LDL-C. Phase 1 results did not suggest any substantial difference among statins for achievement of NCEP goals or decrease in LDL-C.

    "59": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the single greatest cause of death among adults in the United States. It is also a major cause of disability and is associated with direct and indirect costs that exceed $118 billion annually. Elevation of serum lipid levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, is closely linked to the development of CHD. Lipid levels that increase the risk of CHD are present in nearly one third of the US population. Large-scale intervention studies have shown that decreasing LDL-C can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality, adverse cardiovascular events, and the requirement for revascularization procedures. Statins are now thought the most effective agents for lowering LDL-C, and they also have positive effects on other components of the serum lipid profile. These drugs are also better tolerated than other lipid-lowering agents. Statin therapy significantly decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and is a cost-effective cardiovascular treatment according to current standards. Because statins vary substantially in acquisition cost, using statins in the most cost-effective manner is important for controlling health-care costs. Optimizing the cost-effectiveness of statin therapy is a particular concern to managed care organizations in light of the large number of patients who are now considered candidates for this treatment.",

    "66": "Biochemical, epidemiological, and genetic findings demonstrate a link between cholesterol levels, processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and Alzheimer's disease. In the present report, we identify the alpha-secretase ADAM 10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) as a major target of the cholesterol effects on APP metabolism. Treatment of various peripheral and neural cell lines with either the cholesterol-extracting agent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or the hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin resulted in a drastic increase of secreted alpha-secretase cleaved soluble APP. This strong stimulatory effect was in the range obtained with phorbol esters and was further increased in cells overexpressing ADAM 10. In cells overexpressing APP, the increase of alpha-secretase activity resulted in a decreased secretion of Abeta peptides. Several mechanisms were elucidated as being the basis of enhanced alpha-secretase activity: increased membrane fluidity and impaired internalization of APP were responsible for the effect observed with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin; treatment with lovastatin resulted in higher expression of the alpha-secretase ADAM 10. Our results demonstrate that cholesterol reduction promotes the nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase pathway and the formation of neuroprotective alpha-secretase cleaved soluble APP by several mechanisms and suggest approaches to prevention of or therapy for Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "67": "The prostanoid-IP receptor may be unique among G protein coupled receptors in that it is isoprenylated. In this study, we investigated the effects of the statins lovastatin and cerivastatin on signalling by the mouse (m) IP and the human (h) IP receptors, over-expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and by the hIP receptor, endogenously expressed in human erythroleukaemia cells. Both statins significantly reduced IP receptor-mediated cyclic AMP generation and intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) mobilization in a time and concentration dependent manner but had no effect on signalling by the non-isoprenylated beta(2) adrenergic receptor or by the human prostanoid-TP receptor isoforms. Cerivastatin (IC(50), 50 - 90 nM) was significantly more potent than lovastatin (IC(50), 0.80 - 4.2 microM) in inhibiting IP receptor signalling. Whereas IC(50) values indicated that the hIP receptor was significantly more sensitive than the mIP receptor to the statins, the extent of inhibition of cyclic AMP generation by the mIP receptor was significantly greater than that of the hIP receptor to either statin, even at the highest concentrations used. Pretreatment with either statin significantly reduced IP receptor mediated desensitization of signalling by the h.TPalpha, but not by the h.TPbeta, receptor isoform. These data generated in whole cells point to the possibility that statin therapy may interfere with IP receptor signalling in vivo; such interference may be extenuated under conditions where circulating statin levels are elevated and may account, in part, for some of the pleiotropic affects of the statins not attributed solely to their lipid lowering properties.",

Analysis of clinical trials indicates that the molecule has age and gender-related effects, with a greater cholesterol reduction in women than in men and in elderly than younger patients. Cerivastatin has a dual hepatic metabolism pathway, via the CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 isoenzymes of cytochrome P450; therefore no potentially significant drug interactions with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, for instance erythromycin and itraconazole, have been reported.

Recent trials have demonstrated that in subjects with coronary artery disease, an aggressive treatment with high doses of statins, which lowers LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dl, can obtain better results in terms of reduction of cardiovascular events, compared to the currently used dosage of statins. The pharmacologic effect of statins is far beyond the mere reduction of LDL cholesterol, in that it has been demonstrated that they are able to inhibit the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and macrophages, to restore the endothelial activity, and to inhibit the inflammatory response of macrophages. These effects have been called \"pleiotropic effects\" of statins. These metabolic activities of statins play an important role in contrasting the inflammatory elements of the atherosclerotic plaque. The atherosclerotic plaque is formed by a lipid core and a fibrous cap. Smooth muscle cells, macrophages and T lymphocytes are present in the plaque, particularly in the fibrous cap. In stable plaques, smooth muscle cells produce extracellular matrix, i.e. collagen and elastin, which strengthens the fibrous cap. In the presence of inflammatory stimuli, primarily oxidized LDL, T lymphocytes activate macrophage and smooth muscle cells to secrete cytokines and proteolytic enzymes, the collagenolytic metalloproteases, that can weaken the extracellular matrix and rupture the fibrous cap. A local thrombotic mechanism starts in the ruptured plaque, promoted by the tissue factor released by macrophages in the lipid core of the plaque, which can propagate to the coronary lumen with total occlusion. Statins have been demonstrated to contrast the inflammatory activity of macrophages and smooth muscle cells, inducing smooth muscle cells to secrete extracellular matrix which strengthens the fibrous cap and prevents rupture. At present, the primary target of statins is LDL cholesterol reduction, but with additional effects on the inflammatory cell of the plaque with a reduction in macrophages and secretion of collagenolytic metalloproteases and reinforcing the fibrous skeleton of the plaque by increasing the content of interstitial collagen.",

Lovastatin and phenylacetate promote p21 accumulation but fail to induce cell cycle arrest. BCL-2 gene transfer inhibits apoptosis induced by lovastatin but not apoptosis induced by phenylacetate. Wild-type p53 gene transfer promotes lovastatin-induced apoptosis in p53 wild-type LN-229 cells but not in p53 mutant T98G cells. Phenylacetate-induced apoptosis is attenuated by wild-type p53 gene transfer in both cell lines. Neither lovastatin nor phenylacetate modulate glioma cell sensitivity to CD95 ligand-induced apoptosis or cancer chemotherapy. Thus, this study provides no rationale for clinical trials of lovastatin or phenylacetate in the differentiation therapy of malignant glioma.

In guinea pigs fed a diet containing 15% (w/w) fat rich in laurate for 6 weeks, the liver cholesterol content was markedly increased and plasma total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and LDL-apoB were elevated 4.8, 5.2 and 1.7 times, respectively, compared with normal diet fed animals. These changes were maintained by reduced LDL clearance in the presence of markedly cholesterol-enriched LDL in the plasma. In this model, the LDL-C reduction rates by 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg of NK-104 orally administered for 2 weeks (from week 4 to week 6), were 11, 27 and 32%, respectively, from controls, being similar in normal guinea pigs previously examined. Those for 3 and 10 mg/kg of atorvastatin (CAS 134523-00-5) were 25 and 39%, respectively. Thus about 10 times higher doses of atorvastatin were required than of NK-104 to cause a similar cholesterol-lowering effect. This reduction of plasma cholesterol was accompanied by an improvement of LDL clearance (24 and 47% increase in fractional catabolic rate by 1 mg/kg of NK-104 and 10 mg/kg of atorvastatin, respectively) and LDL composition. In conclusion, in guinea pig hypercholesterolemia caused by high-laurate diet, NK-104 and atorvastatin lowered plasma cholesterol levels with an improvement of LDL composition and with an increase in LDL clearance, presumably through reduction of the liver cholesterol content, although hepatic cholesterol synthesis might have been markedly suppressed in this model.",

Analysis of event reduction trials has revealed that LDL-C lowering is only one part of the therapy needed to stabilize plaque. HMG-Co-A-reductase inhibitors, fibrates, and statins all have differing mechanisms of action that provide not only lipid but also inflammatory, rheologic, and coagulation benefits.

Mainly because of the on-course modification of the study protocol, 402/2133 (18.8%) patients in the control group started a cholesterol-lowering treatment during follow-up. Conversely, 296/2138 (13.8%) patients permanently stopped taking their tablets. Side effects, however, were the reason for discontinuing therapy in 57 (2.7%) patients in the pravastatin group, and patient reluctance to continue accounted for most of the remainder. After excluding control patients who had started a cholesterol-lowering treatment during follow-up, the following changes of median lipid concentrations in the control group over the whole course were observed: total cholesterol -1.9%; LDL cholesterol -2.9%; triglycerides -2.0%; HDL cholesterol +1.4%. The analysis carried out excluding patients randomized to pravastatin treatment and actually not assuming the drug clearly indicated the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of low-dose pravastatin (total cholesterol -12.5%; LDL cholesterol -18.8%; triglycerides -7.9%; HDL cholesterol +3.4%). During the study 256 (6.0%) patients either died or had a non-fatal stroke or a myocardial infarction, 136 (6.4%) in the control group and 120 (5.6%) in the pravastatin group (relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.71-1.15, p = 0.41); 160 patients died, 88 (4.1%) in the control group and 72 (3.4%) in the pravastatin group (relative risk 0.84, 94% confidence interval 0.61-1.14, p = 0.26). The few (n = 28) non-cardiovascular deaths were balanced: 16 (0.8%) in the control group and 15 (0.6%) in the pravastatin group. The reduction of cardiovascular events was more evident in the by-treatment analysis, with coronary heart disease deaths being significantly decreased (relative risk 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.96, p = 0.04).

In balloon-dilated matched vascular segments, the change in lumen, vessel, and plaque area was assessed. A comparison was made between statintreated (n = 5) and non-statin-treated patients (n = 5) in lumen, vessel, and plaque changes. At follow-up, both statin-treated and non-statin-treated patients showed a similar increase in plaque volume at the nondilated segment (+4% and +2%, respectively). In statin-treated patients the plaque volume increase was compensated by an increase in vessel volume (+2%), resulting in an increase in lumen volume (+1%). In non-statin-treated patients, on the other hand, the increase in plaque volume was associated with a decrease in vessel volume (-2%), resulting in a decrease in lumen volume (-4%). At the balloon-dilated segment a similar trend in changes of lumen, vessel, and plaque was encountered. Differences between both groups of patients were not statistically significant. Despite the nonsignificant nature of the observation, this small retrospective IVUS study may generate the hypothesis that statin therapy may contribute to superior long-term lumen dimensions by inducing positive vascular remodeling both in nondilated and balloon-dilated vascular segments.",

Moreover, elevated Abeta42 levels and the varepsilon4 allele of the lipid-carrier apolipoprotein E are regarded as risk factors for sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease. Here we demonstrate that the widely used cholesterol-lowering drugs simvastatin and lovastatin reduce intracellular and extracellular levels of Abeta42 and Abeta40 peptides in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and mixed cortical neurons. Likewise, guinea pigs treated with high doses of simvastatin showed a strong and reversible reduction of cerebral Abeta42 and Abeta40 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain homogenate. These results suggest that lipids are playing an important role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Lowered levels of Abeta42 may provide the mechanism for the observed reduced incidence of dementia in statin-treated patients and may open up avenues for therapeutic interventions.",

Due to the relative ease of collecting multiple samples throughout a study, semen analysis in non-rodents such as dogs offers the opportunity to assess potential development of functional effects of compounds on male reproduction over time. In the present study, semen parameters were evaluated in beagle dogs during and at termination of a chronic toxicity study with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin. Male dogs received 0, 10, 40, or 120 mg/kg orally in gelatin capsules for up to 104 weeks (n = 10/group).

Semen was collected from all animals for 3 consecutive weeks prior to termination of the 52-week animals (Weeks 50, 51, 52) for analysis of sperm parameters, using manual methods of evaluation. Semen was collected from the remaining animals at Weeks 64, 78, 91, and 104, and was analyzed.

There were no drug-related differences in semen volume and color, total sperm count, and sperm concentration, morphology, progressiveness, and percent motility during treatment with atorvastatin. There were also no effects on reproductive organ weights or histopathology, and no effects on epididymal sperm count. Thus, incorporation of semen analyses into this study allowed the evaluation of potential male reproductive effects in dogs at multiple time points during the study. Statistical power calculations demonstrated acceptable statistical power (> 80%) for semen sperm count, concentration, morphology, and motility with group sizes of 8--10 animals, and for semen sperm count and concentration or epididymal sperm count with group sizes of 3--5 animals, using the methodology described in this paper.",

Because a common genetic deficiency of chitotriosidase modifies serum quitotriosidase activity, this genetic variation was also studied. Seven subjects of 116 (6.03%) were homozygous, and 46 (39.6%) were heterozygous for the defective allele. Mean serum quitotriosidase activity correlated with allele dosage, as it was found to be of 0, 59.8 +/- 52.6 and 81.2 +/- 41.6 nmol/mL/h, in homozygotes for the defective allele, heterozygotes, and homozygotes for the wild-type allele, respectively (P =.0011 for the difference between the last 2 groups). However, this enzyme activity was not found to correlate with lipid levels before and after treatment with either atorvastatin or bezafibrate, and neither with the intensity of the lipid lowering.

    "133": "The underlying mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of S (simvastatin), a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) is still poorly understood. In the present study, we used synchronized human SMC, isolated from left interior mammary artery, as an in vitro model to test the effects of S on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced DNA synthesis, extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38/stress-activated protein kinase 2 (SAPK2), RhoA and Rac1 activation. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was triggered within 2 min of PDGF stimulation (early G1 phase) and was blocked by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the ERK1/2 pathway, which also strongly inhibited PDGF-induced DNA synthesis (IC(50) = 10 micromol/L). PDGF quickly induced p38 phosphorylation (early G1 phase) and SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38/SAPK2 pathway, also blocked PDGF-induced DNA synthesis (IC(50) = 0.3 micromol/L). Translocation to the plasma membrane of small GTPases, such as RhoA and Rac1, could not be detected within 15 min of stimulation with PDGF or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (early G1 phase), but occurred after 24 hr of PDGF stimulation (late G1/S phase). S inhibited PDGF-induced DNA synthesis (IC(50) = 3.5 micromol/L), and this effect was dependent on intracellular mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate availability. The critical time period for the reversal of the S effect by mevalonate comprised both the early and late G1 phase of the SMC cycle. PDGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and PDGF-induced p38 phosphorylation were not markedly affected by S during the whole G1 phase. However, S treatment blocked the PDGF- and LPA-induced membrane translocation of RhoA that occurred during the late G1/S phase. In the case of Rac1, the same process was also inhibited by S treatment. We concluded from these results that, in SMC, the early events associated with ERK1/2 and p38 signal transduction pathways, recruited for PDGF-mediated DNA synthesis, were insensitive to S action, whereas the mevalonate-dependent, posttranslational modification of RhoA and Rac1 molecules, required for PDGF-induced membrane translocation, was blocked by this drug. These results suggest that the antiproliferative effect of S can be explained not only by the blockage of RhoA-mediated signaling events but also by Rac1-mediated signaling events.",

All patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) followed by oral 5-FU 200 mg(-1)d for 2 months. Patients were then randomly assigned to control (n = 42) and pravastatin (n = 41) groups. Pravastatin was administered at a daily dose of 40 mg.

    "140": "The conventional concepts of the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes are changing. High-risk lesions are not necessarily the angiographicaly 'tight' stenoses. Rather, vulnerable lesions are those that are unstable, with a large lipid core and a thin fibrous cap. Plaque instability is closely related to the development of inflammation within the intima and acute coronary syndromes result from rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Stabilization of lesions by modification of structure and content, rather than simple improvement in the luminal diameter, provides a new therapeutic target. Stabilization may be accomplished through lifestyle changes and appropriate pharmacologic therapy. In the past few years, it has become evident that a major beneficial effect of statins is to induce plaque stability and regression. In fact, statins, in addition to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have a variety of pleiotropic, or cholesterol-independent, effects that make them a particularly suitable choice in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Among these are improvements in endothelial function, smooth muscle cells, thrombus formation/platelet function, and inflammation.",

Recent evidence from small-scale clinical trials shows that standard doses of statins can be both safe and effective when given early after an acute coronary event, including early after thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction. Angiographic studies have shown beneficial effects of pravastatin on coronary stenosis when initiated after a coronary event. While none of these studies have been powered to demonstrate an effect on outcome, each has shown a reduction in major cardiovascular events. Two large observational studies have shown a reduction in 6- and 12-month risk-adjusted mortality among post-MI patients treated early with statins. Large-scale trials of all statins are now in progress to evaluate further the efficacy of early initiation of statin therapy in acute coronary syndromes.

Although type 2 diabetes is associated with a clustering of risk factors (small, dense low-density lipoprotein [LDL] particles, low high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, high triglycerides, elevated blood pressure, obesity, central obesity, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, etc.), the cause for an excess risk of CVD remains unknown. Recent drug treatment trials have indicated that the lowering of total and LDL cholesterol and blood pressure is similarly beneficial in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The treatment of hyperglycaemia reduces micro- and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetic patients. Beta-blocking agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and thrombolytic therapy are also effective in the treatment of CVD amongst diabetic patients.", 
    "144": "In England, only 30% of patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD) and raised serum lipids, and fewer than 4% of individuals eligible for primary prevention, receive lipid-lowering therapy. Target total cholesterol concentrations are achieved in fewer than 50% of patients who do receive such treatment. Here, we review the use of statin therapy in the prevention of CHD events.", 
    "145": "To assess the cost effectiveness of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor therapy, particularly atorvastatin, in primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Canada.", 
    "146": "A Markov model was developed in which costs and effectiveness of atorvastatin were compared with those of other statins and with no drug therapy in primary and secondary prevention of CAD.", 
    "147": "Cost effectiveness was assessed for cohorts of patients with risk profiles defined by CAD status, age, sex, pretreatment low density lipoprotein cholesterol level and presence of sentinel coronary risk factors. Coronary risk was estimated by using initial and subsequent event coronary risk equations from the Framingham Heart Study, and risk factors were estimated by using Canadian population survey data. Recent estimates of the costs of CAD-related medical care in Canada were used to assign costs to health states and acute coronary events.", 
    "148": "Interventions included atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, pravastatin 20 mg, fluvastatin 20 mg, lovastatin 20 mg and no pharmacological therapy.", 
    "149": "Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (CDN$/year of life gained) relative to no therapy were lowest for atorvastatin and highest for pravastatin across all risk profiles. Atorvastatin was less costly and more effective than lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin in primary and secondary prevention, and conferred additional health benefits at a reduced cost per year of life gained compared with fluvastatin.", 
    "150": "Atorvastatin was found to be the most cost effective statin in primary and secondary prevention of CAD.", 
    "151": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) lower serum cholesterol and decrease the incidence of stroke and cardiovascular disease. There is growing evidence that statins exert some of their beneficial effects independent of cholesterol lowering. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that chronic simvastatin administration upregulates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), resulting in more functional protein, augmentation of cerebral blood flow, and neuroprotection in a murine model of cerebral ischemia. In this report we examined whether another member of the statin family shared these effects and whether eNOS upregulation is sustained with longer treatment.", 
    "152": "Mevastatin (2 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg per day) was administered to 18- to 22-g male mice for 7, 14, or 28 days before 2-hour middle cerebral artery occlusion with the use of the filament model (n=9 to 12). Neurological deficits and cerebral infarct volumes were assessed at 24 hours. Arterial blood pressure and gases, relative cerebral blood flow, and blood cholesterol levels were monitored in a subset of animals (n=5). Absolute cerebral blood flow was measured by the [(14)C]iodoamphetamine indicator fractionation technique (n=6). eNOS mRNA and protein levels were determined.", 
    "153": "Mevastatin increased levels of eNOS mRNA and protein, reduced infarct size, and improved neurological deficits in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Greatest protection was seen with 14- and 28-day high-dose treatment (26% and 37% infarct reduction, respectively). Cholesterol levels were reduced only after 28 days of treatment and did not correlate with infarct reduction. Baseline absolute cerebral blood flow was 30% higher after 14-day high-dose treatment.", 
    "154": "Chronic prophylactic treatment with mevastatin upregulated eNOS and augmented cerebral blood flow. These changes occurred in the absence of changes in serum cholesterol levels, were sustained for up to 1 month of treatment, and resulted in neuroprotection after middle cerebral artery occlusion.", 
    "155": "The mevinolin-resistance determinant, hmg, encodes the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and is a commonly used selectable marker in halobacterial genetics. Plasmids bearing this marker suffer from instability in Haloferax volcanii because the resistance gene was derived from the genome of this species and is almost identical in sequence to the chromosomal copy. In order to reduce the level of homologous recombination between introduced plasmid vectors and the chromosome of Haloferax, a homologue of the hmg determinant was obtained from the distantly related organism, Haloarcula hispanica. The nucleotide sequences of the wild-type genes (hmgA) of these two species are only 78% identical, and the predicted protein sequences show 71% identity. In comparison to the wild-type hmgA gene, the resistance gene from a mutant resistant to simvastatin (an analogue of mevinolin) showed a single base substitution in the putative promoter. Plasmids constructed using the new resistance determinant were stably maintained under selection in Hfx. volcanii and possessed very low recombination rates with the chromosome of this species. In addition, an improved strain of Hfx. volcanii was developed to overcome the plasmid instability and growth reduction observed in the commonly used WFD11 strain.", 
    "156": "Statins reduce cardiovascular events and progression of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). beta-Blockers are also known to reduce cardiovascular events, but less is known about their effects on carotid IMT.", 
    "157": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center trial to compare the effects of low-dose metoprolol CR/XL (25 mg once daily) and fluvastatin (40 mg once daily) on the progression of carotid IMT during 36 months of treatment in 793 subjects who had carotid plaque but no symptoms of carotid artery disease. Changes in mean IMT in the common carotid artery and maximal IMT in the bulb were the main outcome variables. Death and cardiovascular events were monitored. Progression of IMT(max) in the carotid bulb at both 18 and 36 months was reduced by metoprolol CR/XL (-0.058 mm/y; 95% CI, -0.094 to -0.023; P=0.004; and -0.023 mm/y; 95% CI, -0.044 to -0.003; P=0.014, respectively). Incidence of cardiovascular events tended to be lower in metoprolol CR/XL-treated patients (5 versus 13 patients, P=0.055). Rate of IMT(mean) progression in the common carotid at 36 months was reduced by fluvastatin (-0.009 mm/y; 95% CI, -0.015 to -0.003; P=0.002). Women in the fluvastatin group had increased frequency of transiently high liver enzymes.", 
    "158": "This is the first randomized trial to show that a beta-blocker can reduce the rate of progression of carotid IMT in clinically healthy, symptom-free subjects with carotid plaque. This suggests that beta-blockers may have a favorable effect on atherosclerosis development.", 
    "159": "Relaxations to acetylcholine and contractions to acetylcholine in the presence of the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor (L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester, L-NAME) were studied in aortic rings from rabbits fed either a control or a diet containing 0.5% cholesterol+14% coconut oil for 14 weeks and treated or not with atorvastatin (2.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). Rings were incubated with the endothelin (ET(A)) receptor antagonist BQ123, and/or the thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2))/prostaglandin H(2) (PGH(2)) receptor antagonist ifetroban. In rabbits, high cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels were associated with intimal thickening and blunted acetylcholine-relaxation as compared with controls. By contrast, acetylcholine+L-NAME response was higher. Incubation with either ifetroban or BQ123 increased acetylcholine-relaxation in both diet groups and it reduced the constrictor response only in dyslipidemic rabbits. Removal of endothelium reduced acetylcholine+L-NAME contraction in dyslipidemic rabbits, although increased it in control animals. Atorvastatin treatment reduced plasma lipid levels and lesion size in dyslipidemic animals. Likewise, it prevented acetylcholine-relaxation reduction. In addition, atorvastatin reduced constrictor response in dyslipidemic rabbits but only in rings with endothelium. Incubation with either ifetroban or BQ123 did not further modify these responses in atorvastatin-treated animals in any group. These data suggest that ET and TXA(2) availabilities seem to participate in the endothelial dysfunction associated with dyslipidemia. Atorvastatin treatment reduces intimal thickening and improves endothelial dysfunction in rabbits. This effect seems to be a consequence of its ability to act on ET and TXA(2) systems.", 
    "160": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive sterol storage disease characterised clinically by juvenile bilateral cataracts, progressive neurological dysfunction, and formation of tendon xanthomata. We describe the clinical and biochemical features, molecular diagnosis and long-term management of the first reported Australasian case of CTX. Molecular analysis confirmed the diagnosis of CTX and demonstrated that the patient was homozygous for a G-->A transition in the splice donor site of intron 4 of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene. Serum cholestanol concentrations were decreased with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin alone and greater reductions were achieved after the addition of the bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid; suggesting a synergistic effect of this combination. Despite serum cholestanol concentrations remaining within the low-normal range, there has been no significant improvement in mental and physical abilities or in EEG abnormalities with 5 years of treatment. Metabolism of radiolabeled 7-ketocholesterol to aqueous soluble products was absent in CTX-derived macrophages. Consistent with this finding, plasma 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, 7 beta-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol concentrations were increased in the CTX subject compared with controls.", 
    "161": "Treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors can reduce cardiovascular mortality of patients with atherosclerosis. This effect is probably due not only to a decrease in concentration of cholesterol, but also to non-lipid-involving mechanisms elicited by the action of statin drugs.", 
    "162": "To investigate the influence of short-term therapy with simvastatin on markers of inflammation and oxidation processes in patients with hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "163": "We administered 20mg simvastatin daily for 12 weeks to 19 patients with hypercholesterolaemia (250-400 mg/dl). Peripheral blood samples for evaluation of plasma concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (malonaldehyde), stable metabolites of nitric oxide (NOx) and interleukin 6 (11-6) were taken before and after the therapy.", 
    "164": "Plasma levels of malonaldehyde decreased significantly (from 4.533+/-0.428 versus 3.690+/-0.310 micromol/l, P = 0.04) during the study period. Similarly, there was a significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of NOx (from 33.477+/-4.352 micromol/l versus 25.919+/-2.561 micromol/l, P = 0.02). There were significant positive correlations between concentrations of total cholesterol and NOx in plasma (r = 0.4397, P = 0.008) and of low-density lipoprotein and NOx (r = 0.3987, P = 0.02). The plasma level of interleukin 6 remained unchanged by the intervention (1.837+/-0.200 versus 1.820+/-0.169 pg/ml, P = 0.54).", 
    "165": "Short-term therapy with simvastatin decreases the plasma concentrations of markers of peroxidation of lipids and of stable metabolites of nitric oxide in hypercholesterolaemic patients, but leaves levels of interleukin 6 unaffected.", 
    "166": "A 68-year-old woman, with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and prior long-term simvastatin therapy, self-resumed troglitazone after running out of metformin. She developed an acute severe hepatitis with microvesicular steatosis and mysositis. There was subsequent resolution of the myositis but progression of the hepatitis to symptomatic cirrhosis over a period of 12 weeks. Both troglitazone and simvastatin are metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A4. Troglitazone typically induces metabolism of drugs metabolized by this cytochrome so that simple simvastatin toxicity seems less likely to have been involved. The association with myositis, the severity of the hepatitis with progression to cirrhosis, and the presence of microvesicular steatosis suggests altered mitochondrial metabolism, which has been described with each agent, as the underlying pathogenic mechanism. Although troglitazone (Rezulin) has been withdrawn from the market, other similar agents are available for therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Increased awareness of a potential interaction between these two classes of drugs is warranted."
