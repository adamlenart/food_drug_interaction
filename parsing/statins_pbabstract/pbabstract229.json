These lipid-lowering drugs are the first-line pharmacologic therapy for hypercholesterolemia. In this paper, the interaction of a series of statin molecules STCOOH (pravastatin (prava), mevastatin (meva), simvastatin (simva) and fluvastatin (fluva)) with a phosphatidylcholine monolayer immobilized on to porous silica particles has been studied using a biochromatographic approach (molecular chromatography). The immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) provided a biophysical model system to study the binding of the statin molecules to a lipid membrane. For all the test statin molecules, linear retention plots were observed at all temperatures. An analysis of the thermodynamics (i.e., enthalpy (DeltaH(0)), entropy (DeltaS(0)*)) of the interaction of the statin molecules with the immobilized monolayer was also carried out. The DeltaH(0) and DeltaS(0)* values were negative due to van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding between the statin molecules with the polar head groups of the phospholipid monolayer (polar retention effect). The statin elution order was: Prava<Meva<Atorva<Simva<Fluva. This result associated with IC50 data of each statin molecule confirmed that pravastatin, which exhibited the lowest association with the lipid monolayer, was taken up by a membrane transporter. In addition, the logarithm of the statin retention factor with the lipid membrane extrapolated to a total aqueous bulk solvent at pH 7.0 (log k'(w-IAM)) was measured and compared to the octanol-water partition coefficient (logP). The observed significant correlation showed an affinity enhanced with the increase in the molecule lipophilicity and confirmed that the hydrophobic forces played an important role in the statin molecule-biomembrane association mechanism. As well, the affinity of STCOOH to IAM is high and changes slightly with the bulk solvent pH, because the number of protons linked to binding is low. This confirmed the importance to take into account the electrostatic interaction in this association mechanism. At pHs lower than approximately 7.0, the binding process is accompanied by protons release and at higher pHs protons are taken up. A change in the phospholipid monolayer phosphate group pK(a) has been proposed to contribute to the positive number of protons exchanged at pHs higher than approximately 7.0. This demonstrated that this phosphate residue could function as a general base/proton shuttle by facilitating the deprotonation of STCOOH, i.e., this hyper-reactive residue in the IAM surface could play a catalytic function.",

The targeting of host lipid metabolism, particularly via the cholesterol-lowering 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins, represents a novel approach to hepatitis C therapy and has been proven beneficial in vitro. The study in this issue of the Journal is the first prospective trial that shows benefit, albeit modest, of statin therapy in vivo. While limited by heterogeneous patient population and overall small numbers, this study provides hope that use of statins in combination with standard therapy pegylated interferon and ribavirin may improve SVR.",

He had been commenced on a course of fusidic acid at discharge in addition to his ongoing statin prescription and presented 4 weeks later with symptoms consistent with rhabdomyolysis. Severe rhabdomyolysis was confirmed and despite prolonged and complicated critical care management, his treatment was unsuccessful. Extensive investigations ruled out other known causes of this clinical presentation and failed to identify any other precipitating cause of rhabdomyolysis. We believe the most likely cause was hepatic inhibition of the CYP3A4 hepatic isoenzyme by fusidic acid resulting in an acute severe rise in plasma simvastatin level and extensive myocellular damage. Increasing MRSA colonisation and infection rates together with increased statin usage have the potential to increase the incidence of this presumed drug interaction.",

Currently, the only efficient therapy against BKV nephritis seems to be a reduction or change of immunosuppressive agents, but this may increase the inherent risk of rejection. Here, we report the ability of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin), which is routinely used to treat hypercholesterolemia, to repress BKV entry pathways in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HRPTEC) and, correspondently, prevent BKV infection.",

However, when pravastatin was added 72 hr after BKV infection it failed to decrease percentage of BKV infected cells. It is likely, that pravastatin's inhibitory effect is explained by depletion of caveolin-1, a critical element of caveolae. BKV enters HRPTEC by caveolar-mediated endocytosis. We provide evidence that pravastatin dramatically decreased caveolin-1 expression in HRPTEC and interfered with internalization of labeled BKV particles.",

No differences were observed in angiotensinogen expression on monocytes while T lymphocytes of high-risk subjects show higher expression. One-month treatment of high-risk subjects with simvastatin resulted in a reduction of angiotensin II type 1 receptor mRNA without affecting angiotensin II type 2 receptor whereas angiotensinogen mRNA expression was reduced at least in monocytes.

    "29": "A series of cytochrome P450 (P450) inhibition experiments were conducted with four hepatic uptake substrates (AZ3, AZ25, atorvastatin, and pitavastatin) using hepatocytes and recombinant P450s. The uptake was shown to be temperature-dependent and was inhibited by estrone sulfate, signifying an active component. At the lowest concentrations tested, the inhibitors concentrated up to 1000-fold in rat hepatocytes, but demonstrated only 5-fold greater P450 inhibition relative to recombinant rat P450s, indicating high intracellular binding. Inhibitor accumulation was considerably lower in human hepatocytes and an increase in inhibitory potency relative to recombinant human P450s was not obvious. This study highlights several technical and conceptual issues in the study of P450 inhibition mediated by compounds actively transported across the basolateral hepatocyte membrane. Primarily, the incubation medium concentration once the inhibitor has fully accumulated into the hepatocytes rather than the starting medium concentration, along with the extent of intracellular binding, must be considered as a foundation for in vitro-in vivo extrapolations. Additionally, it is suggested that if the K(m) value for the active uptake process is close to the P450 inhibition K(i), hepatocytes may be used only to establish the free drug accumulation ratio at a clinically relevant drug concentration, and this information, along with the (recombinant P450) K(i) value, may be used to simulate the likely impact of active hepatic uptake on P450 inhibition in vivo.", 
    "30": "The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is reported to mediate the beneficial effects of statin on the vascular functions, but the biochemical mechanisms are incompletely understood. The aim of the study was to determine how statin activates AMPK. Exposure of confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells to simvastatin (statin) dose-dependently increased phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr(172) and activities of AMPK, which was in parallel with increased detection of both LKB1 phosphorylation at Ser(428) and LKB1 nuclear export. Furthermore, statin treatment was shown to increase protein kinase C (PKC)-zeta activity and PKC-zeta phosphorylation at Thr(410)/Thr(403). Consistently, inhibition of PKC-zeta either by pharmacological or genetic manipulations abolished statin-enhanced LKB1 phosphorylation at Ser(428), blocked LKB1 nucleus export, and prevented the subsequent activation of AMPK. Similarly, in vivo transfection of PKC-zeta-specific small interfering RNA in C57BL/6J mice significantly attenuated statin-enhanced phosphorylation of AMPK-Thr(172), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)-Ser(79), and LKB1-Ser(428). In addition, statin significantly increased reactive oxygen species, whereas preincubation of mito-TEMPOL, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, abolished statin-enhanced phosphorylation of both AMPK-Thr(172) and ACC-Ser(79). Finally, in vivo administration of statin increased 3-nitrotyrosine and the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in C57BL/6J mice but not in mice deficient in endothelial nitric-oxide synthase. Taken together, our data suggest that AMPK activation by statin is peroxynitrite-mediated but PKC-zeta-dependent.", 
    "31": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) accounts for more than 300,000 deaths annually in the United States. The goal of medical therapy in patients considered to be at high risk (coronary artery disease, post myocardial infarction, structural heart disease and congestive heart failure) involves treating the disease state as well prevention of potentially lethal arrhythmias. Treatment with angiotensin receptor inhibitors, beta blockers and statins has been shown to improve survival in this high risk group. The use of anti-arrhythmic drugs has been studied and found to lack efficacy and has potential for adverse effects. The role of omega-3 fatty acids in preventing sudden death continues to evolve.", 
    "32": "Placebo-controlled clinical trials have shown that atorvastatin is beneficial in patients with myocardial ischemia, established coronary artery disease, hypertension and 3 other cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. left-ventricular hypertrophy, type 2 diabetes, smoking), and in diabetes, but not in patients with calcific aortic stenosis. Recently, intensive low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin 80 mg/day has been shown to have a greater clinical benefit than atorvastatin 10 mg/day in patients with coronary heart disease and one other high-risk factor (previous myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization or angina), and to be superior to moderate lipid lowering with pravastatin (40 mg/day) in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. However, a smaller study comparing lovastatin 5 mg/day with atorvastatin 80 mg/day was unable to detect any difference in outcomes in patients with stable coronary disease, despite the greater LDL-cholesterol lowering with the atorvastatin, possibly because it was not powered to do so. In a retrospective cohort study, atorvastatin 10 mg/day, pravastatin 20 mg/day, simvastatin 20 mg/day, lovastatin 20 mg/day and fluvastatin 20 mg/day had similar efficacy as secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction. At present, the evidence from clinical trials is favouring the intensity of the effect on LDL-cholesterol and/or C-reactive protein (CRP) with atorvastatin 80 mg, rather than the use of atorvastatin per se, when greater benefits are observed with the 80 mg dose of atorvastatin compared to other statins. Thus, at present, it is not clear whether atorvastatin is superior to other statins in some indications (coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndromes) or whether it is the intensive lipid lowering that is responsible for the superiority. Atorvastatin has little or no ability to increase high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and this may be a disadvantage in patients with metabolic syndrome or diabetes, where low HDL-cholesterol is a key feature. Thus, other statins should probably be preferred to atorvastatin in patients with diabetes/metabolic syndrome. Alternatively, atorvastatin can be used in combination with a fibrate to increase HDL-cholesterol in patients with diabetes/metabolic syndrome.",

We found that administration of simvastatin not only interfered with the development of EAM, but also inhibited the transfer. Antigen presenting cells (APCs) were proved to be important for the development of EAM. The ability of myocarditic splenocytes to transfer myocarditis was enhanced after co-culture with APCs. During co-culture of the myocarditic splenocytes and the APCs, simvastatin not only decreased percentages of CD28 expression in CD4-positive myocarditic splenocytes, and CD80 and CD86 expressions in APCs, but also inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-partial differential in the CD4-positive myocarditic splenocytes and the APCs.

The Self Evaluation of Lovastatin to Enhance Cholesterol Treatment (SELECT) Study was designed to assess consumers' ability to self-select for treatment with lovastatin in an unsupervised setting. Subjects examined proposed OTC lovastatin cartons with labels that detailed an algorithm for self-selection based on age, lipid profile, and cardiovascular risk factors. Subjects viewed a carton with either a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-based self-selection algorithm or one based on total cholesterol. Labels also contained warnings against use based on health conditions that might increase the risk of adverse events. Subjects were asked if the drug was appropriate for their use (self-assessment) and whether they would like to purchase the drug (purchase decision). A total of 1,326 consumers provided self-assessment decisions. After viewing the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-based label, 82%, 36%, and 82% of those who self-assessed that the drug was appropriate for their use were correct with respect to the age, lipid, and risk-factor criteria, respectively. Corresponding numbers for the total cholesterol algorithm were 85%, 50% and 75%. Almost 90% of women aged <55 years who evaluated the drug indicated the drug was not right for them, and women in this age group made up only 9% of the total group of subjects who believed the drug was appropriate for their use. The label was also effective in discouraging use by women who were or may become pregnant, consumers with liver disease, and those with potential drug interactions.

After a run-in on simvastatin 20 mg/day, both NER/S doses (1,000/20 and 2,000/20 mg/day) resulted in greater decreases in non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol vs simvastatin 20 mg/day (-13.9% and -22.5% vs -7.4%, respectively; p <0.01). Significant improvements in HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a), and total/HDL cholesterol ratio were also observed. Patients with hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides > or =200 mg/dl) typically had greater lipid responses to NER/S with the notable exception that HDL cholesterol responses to NER/S were similar in those with or without increased triglycerides. Treatment with both doses of NER/S was well tolerated; < or =60% of patients in any treatment group experienced flushing, >90% of flushing was mild or moderate in intensity, and only 7.5% of patients in both NER/S treatment groups discontinued because of flushing.

    "59": "Simvastatin has been shown to stimulate osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism by which simvastatin exerts its effects is still unclear. We previously reported that simvastatin promotes bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) expression, induces osteoblastic differentiation, and inhibits adipocytic differentiation in mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), and that this occurs, at least in part, via a BMP-2-dependent pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate further the mechanisms by which simvastatin stimulates osteogenesis in mouse BMSCs. To determine whether simvastatin-mediated osteogenesis was dependent on BMP-2, mouse BMSCs were treated with nonimmune normal mouse IgG or BMP-2 neutralizing antibodies combined with different concentrations of simvastatin. Surprisingly, the stimulatory effect of simvastatin on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was not completely blocked by neutralizing BMP-2 monoclonal antibody treatment. Interestingly, we found that estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) protein levels increased after mouse BMSCs were treated with simvastatin for 72 h in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the stimulatory effect of simvastatin on ALP activity in BMSCs was blocked by the estrogen receptor agonist ICI 182,780, and cotreatment with 17-beta-estradiol and simvastatin increased ALP activities by two-to threefold in the BMSCs compared with treatment with simvastatin alone. These results suggest that simvastatin-induced in vitro osteogenesis in mouse BMSCs is mediated, at least in part, by induction of ER-alpha and not by BMP-2 alone. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms of simvastatin-induced bone formation in BMSCs.",

Statins protect patients from myocardial infarction, though they induce SMC apoptosis. We investigated whether statins and 7-ketocholesterol exerted additive cell death effects.", 
    "61": "Cultured rabbit aorta SMCs (passage 2-6) were exposed to 7-ketocholesterol with or without fluvastatin, simvastatin or pravastatin. Uptake of neutral red (NR), monolayer protein, cleavage of the pan-caspase substrate Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-rhodamine110, cell morphology (light and electron microscopy) and processing of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3, immunoblot) were determined.", 
    "62": "NR uptake declined upon 18 h exposure to 25 microM 7-ketocholesterol (-41+/-3%, n=13), 100 microM fluvastatin (-59%) or 30-100 microM simvastatin (-28 to -74%). Oxysterol and high statin concentrations exerted additive effects, but lower concentrations (fluvastatin 10-30 microM, simvastatin 1-10 microM) partly reversed viability loss. 7-Ketocholesterol caused intense cytoplasmic vacuolization, processing of LC3-I to LC3-II, but little caspase activation (increase 29.5%). Fluvastatin (10-100 microM, 70-545% increase) and simvastatin (3-100 microM 43-322% increase) induced caspase activation without LC3 processing, but failed to activate caspases in 7-ketocholesterol-treated SMCs. Pravastatin up to 100 microM was always inactive.", 
    "63": "7-Ketocholesterol caused SMC death, mainly via autophagic vesicle formation with LC3 processing, whereas lipophilic statins evoked SMC apoptosis. Cell death following 7-ketocholesterol and low statin concentrations were not additive, presumably because the autophagic process interfered with statin-induced caspase activation. This further illustrates that drug effects in normal SMCs are not necessarily predictive for activities in atherosclerotic settings.", 
    "64": "A number of patients with hyperlipidemia are prescribed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors that are concomitantly used along with the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The effects of atorvastatin and pravastatin on insulin-induced glucose uptake and the related signal transduction in 3T3L1 adipocytes were studied. 3T3L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into adipocytes, pretreated with atorvastatin or pravastatin, and then exposed to insulin. Glucose uptake and the amount of insulin signal proteins were measured. Atorvastatin significantly decreased insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3L1 adipocytes associated with the prevention of translocation of GLUT4 into the plasma membrane. The amounts of Rab4 and RhoA that required lipid modification with farnesyl or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, in the membrane fraction were decreased by atorvastatin. Insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and serine/threonine phosphorylation of Akt were reduced by atorvastatin. Pravastatin did not modify these insulin-induced changes in the signal transduction. Inhibitors of the RhoA/Rho kinase system, C3 and Y27632, as well as atorvastatin reduced insulin-induced changes in signal transduction. Atorvastatin and pravastatin did not affect messenger RNA expression, protein level, and tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptors. In conclusion, hydrophobic atorvastatin decreases the glucose uptake by 3T3L1 adipocytes since it can enter the cell and prevents lipid modification of some proteins that are involved in the insulin signal transduction process.",

    "66": "A total of 382 subjects with type 2 diabetes underwent abdominal computed tomography to evaluate subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) distribution and had anthropometric measurements to determine BMI and waist and hip circumference. Fasting blood was obtained for lipoprotein particle number and size using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The relationship of lipoprotein particle number and size with BMI, SAT, and VAT was examined using multivariable regression models adjusted for age, sex, diabetes therapy, duration of diabetes, smoking, statin use, and A1C levels. The relation of VAT to lipoprotein particle number and size was further evaluated after the addition of BMI, BMI plus SAT, or BMI plus homeostatis is model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) to the model.", 
    "67": "VAT was positively related to VLDL particle number (P < 0.0001), LDL particle number (P < 0.01), and VLDL size (P < 0.0001) and negatively related to LDL size (P < 0.0001) and HDL size (P < 0.0001). These relationships remained unchanged after addition of BMI and SAT to the model. After addition of HOMA-IR, VAT remained positively related to VLDL particle number (P < 0.0001) and size (P < 0.01) and negatively related to LDL and HDL particle size (P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Neither BMI nor SAT was independently related to lipoprotein parameters.", 
    "68": "In patients with type 2 diabetes, higher VAT independent of BMI was associated with higher VLDL and LDL particle number, larger VLDL particles, and smaller LDL and HDL particles. This lipoprotein pattern has been associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "69": "Pretreatment with atorvastatin (ATV) reduces infarct size (IS) and increases myocardial expression of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (p-eNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) in the rat. Inhibiting COX2 abolished the ATV-induced IS limitation without affecting p-eNOS and iNOS expression. We investigated 1) whether 3-day ATV pretreatment limits IS in eNOS(-/-) and iNOS(-/-) mice and 2) whether COX2 expression and/or activation by ATV is eNOS, iNOS, and/or NF-kappaB dependent. Male C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), University of North Carolina eNOS(-/-) and iNOS(-/-) mice received ATV (10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1); ATV(+)) or water alone (ATV(-)) for 3 days. Mice underwent 30 min of coronary artery occlusion and 4 h of reperfusion, or hearts were harvested and subjected to ELISA, immunoblotting, biotin switch, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As a result, ATV reduced IS only in the WT mice. ATV increased eNOS, p-eNOS, iNOS, and COX2 levels and activated NF-kappaB in WT mice. It also increased myocardial COX2 activity. In eNOS(-/-) mice, ATV increased COX2 expression but not COX2 activity or iNOS expression. NF-kappaB was not activated by ATV in the eNOS(-/-) mice. In the iNOS(-/-) mice, eNOS and p-eNOS levels were increased but not iNOS and COX2 levels; however, NF-kappaB was activated. In conclusion, both eNOS and iNOS are essential for the IS-limiting effect of ATV. The expression of COX2 by ATV is iNOS, but not eNOS or NF-kappaB, dependent. Activation of COX2 is dependent on iNOS.",

    "71": "Ezetimibe is a cholesterol-lowering agent that modulates intestinal absorption of sterols. It is well tolerated but hepatic toxicity has been reported when ezetimibe is used in conjunction with a statin medication. In this case report, we report severe isolated hyperbilirubinaemia occurring in a patient with occult cirrhosis, probably owing to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, who was treated with ezetimibe alone. The adverse event started after ezetimibe therapy was initiated and resolved when the drug was stopped. We propose a mechanism for this reaction and believe that liver function should be monitored in patients with abnormal liver tests who are treated with ezetimibe, even if they are not on concomitant treatment with a statin.", 
    "72": "The increase in organ transplantation has led to primary care physicians assuming a greater role in the provision of health care. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in transplant patients. The risk factors for cardiovascular disease do not differ from the nontransplant population, except that there is increased prevalence of these risk factors in the transplant population. Post-transplant hyperlipidemia is extremely prevalent, partly because of the underlying condition causing the need for transplantation and partly because of the side effects of immunosuppressant agents. Although there are no large, cardiovascular event outcome trials demonstrating a benefit for lipid-lowering therapy in the transplant population, there is robust literature supporting this treatment in the nontransplant population, and numerous smaller trials in transplant patients have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy. This article reviews the evidence and treatment options for currently available lipid-lowering therapy in solid-organ transplant patients.", 
    "73": "A recent study suggested that statin therapy may prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) following primary angioplasty. Our aim was to assess the effect of statins in this setting in a larger population. We evaluated 589 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction who underwent primary angioplasty at our institution. Contrast-induced nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine by > or =0.5 mg/dL within 72 h following the procedure. Overall, 69 patients (11.9%) developed CIN. The incidence of CIN in the group on statins was 15.9%, as compared with 10.8% in the group not taking statins (p=0.2). Thus, we did not observe a protective effect of statin therapy on CIN development after primary angioplasty.", 
    "74": "There are few prospective clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors (or proliferation signal inhibitors) combined with CNI inhibitors in de novo pediatric renal transplantation. Results reported here are from a multicenter, open-label study in de novo pediatric renal transplant patients (<or=16 yr), in which patients received everolimus with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for one yr, then entered an extension study for a further two yr. Nineteen patients completed the one-yr study, of whom three discontinued study medication. Fifteen of the remaining 16 patients entered the extension study, eight of whom were aged <10 yr (Group 1) and seven were aged 10-16 yr (Group 2). Mean daily dose of everolimus during the first 36 months was 1.53 mg/m(2) BSA. Biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in three patients in Group 2 and in one patient in Group 1. Biopsy-proven chronic allograft rejection was reported in four patients (two in each age group). Graft survival at one yr was 100%; one patient in Group 2 lost their graft subsequently during the extension. For patients entering the extension, patient survival at three yr was 100%. There were three cases of viral infection, including one case of cytomegalovirus infection. At three yr, mean total cholesterol was 5.5 +/- 0.8 mm/L (213 +/- 31 mg/dL) and four patients received statin therapy. Mean serum creatinine at 36 months was 96 +/- 36 microm/L (1.1 +/- 0.4 mg/dL). This is the first long-term prospective study to demonstrate that a regimen of everolimus, cyclosporine, and corticosteroids provides good efficacy, tolerability, and safety in de novo pediatric renal transplant patients.", 
    "75": "Graft coronary artery disease is a significant cause of late graft failure and death after cardiac transplantation. HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors have been used safely in children but their preventative effects against GCAD are not well known. We investigated whether atorvastatin when initiated early could prevent against the development of pediatric GCAD. Pediatric patients (transplanted between October 28, 1992 and July 9, 2004) were stratified into two groups based on whether or not they received atorvastatin early after transplant. Angiograms were reviewed by a single observer blinded to the treatment strategies and clinical outcomes. Actuarial survival method and the Mantel-Cox test were used to assess statistical significance. Freedom from GCAD was higher among those treated with atorvastatin early in the post-transplant course. One, three, and five-yr freedom from GCAD was significantly greater in the early treatment group (97%, 93%, and 93% respectively) compared with the control group (72%, 65%, and 60% respectively, p < 0.005). The early treatment group was also noted for fewer rejection episodes in the first post-transplant year. The use of atorvastatin when initiated early in the post-transplant course appears protective against graft coronary artery disease.", 
    "76": "Lipid-lowering strategies, particularly with statins, have been extremely useful in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, many patients who receive statin monotherapy do not achieve the desired cardiovascular benefits. Accumulation of cholesteryl esters within macrophages constitutes the hallmark of foam cells during atherogenesis. The action of acyl-coenzyme A (CoA): cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) leads to formation of cholesterol esters. There are two different ACAT isoforms: ACAT1 and ACAT2. A considerable interest to develop ACAT inhibitors has been emerging. This review has been focused on the current knowledge about a new ACAT inhibitor, F12511 or eflucimibe, and more particularly on its antiatherosclerotic properties.", 
    "77": "Mevalonate biosynthesis pathway is important in cell growth and survival and its blockade by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, arrest brain neuroblasts growth and induce apoptosis. Translation is among the main biochemical mechanisms that controls gene expression and therefore cell growth or apoptosis. In the CNS, translation regulates synaptic plasticity. Thus, our aim was to investigate the effect of lovastatin in protein translation in rat neuroblasts of the CNS and the biochemical pathways involved. Lovastatin treatment in rat brain neuroblasts causes a significant time- and concentration-inhibition of protein synthesis, which is partially mediated by phosphatydilinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibition. Lovastatin treatment decreases the phosphorylation state of mTOR substrates, p70S6K and eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein 1 and simultaneously increases eIF4E-binding protein 1 in a time-dependent manner. Concomitantly, lovastatin causes a decrease in eIF4G cellular amount, which is partially mediated by caspase(s) activity excluding caspase 3. These biochemical pathways affected by lovastatin might explain the protein translation inhibition observed in neuroblasts. Cycloheximide treatment, which blocked protein synthesis, does not induce neuroblasts apoptosis. Therefore, we suggest that lovastatin-induced protein synthesis inhibition might not contribute to the concomitant neuroblasts apoptosis previously observed.", 
    "78": "A screening technique has been developed that allows the rapid, real-time detection and identification of major transformation products of organic contaminants during aqueous oxidation experiments. In this technique, a target contaminant is dissolved in buffered water and chlorinated by the addition of sodium hypochlorite to give a free chlorine residual of 3 mg/L. Solution from the reaction vessel is combined with methanol and pumped directly into the electrospray ionization source of a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (QTOF MS). The real-time decay of the target contaminant and the formation/decay of transformation products are then monitored using the QTOF MS. Subsequently, accurate mass measurements with internal mass calibration (<5 ppm mass error) and product ion scans are employed to identify these transformation products. Unlike other techniques, it requires no liquid chromatography, derivatization, or quenching of residual chlorine, all of which can interfere with transformation product analysis. To validate the technique, aqueous chlorination experiments were performed on triclosan, a previously studied environmental contaminant. Earlier research showing that triclosan underwent chlorine addition to form mono- and dichlorinated transformation products was successfully reproduced, demonstrating the feasibility of the technique. In addition, the technique revealed the formation of a stable oxygen radical-containing transformation product resulting from the oxidation of either mono- or dichlorinated triclosan. This triclosan transformation product was determined to have an empirical formula of C12H4O3Cl4 with 3.9 ppm mass error. Furthermore, atorvastatin, a commonly prescribed medication and environmental contaminant, was subjected to aqueous chlorination and studied with the technique. Atorvastatin underwent hydroxylation to form two transformation products with the empirical formulas C33H34FN2O6 (1.8 ppm mass error) and C26H29O5NF (2.9 ppm mass error).",

The age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of developing an ER/PR negative tumor was 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.92; P = 0.02) for statin use >or=1 year before breast cancer diagnosis compared with statin use <1 year (including nonuse). Breast cancers in patients with >or=1 year of statin use were more likely to be low grade (OR, 1.44) and less invasive stage (OR, 1.42).", 
    "91": "Breast cancer patients with exposure to statins have proportionately fewer ER/PR-negative tumors that are of lower grade and stage. Although our data set cannot address whether statins affect the incidence of breast cancer, we show that statin use may influence the phenotype of tumors. This suggests a new potential strategy for breast cancer prevention, that of combining statins with agents that prevent ER-positive cancer (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors).", 
    "92": "Clinical and experimental studies have provided evidence suggesting that statins exert renoprotective effects. To investigate the mechanisms by which statins may exert renoprotection, we utilized the hypertensive Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rat model, which manifests cardiovascular and renal injury linked to increased angiotensin II-dependent activation of NADPH oxidase and decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. DS rats given high salt diet (4% NaCl) for 10 wk exhibited hypertension [systolic blood pressure (SBP) 200 +/- 8 vs. 150 +/- 2 mmHg in normal salt diet (0.5% NaCl), P < 0.05], glomerulosclerosis, and proteinuria (158%). This was associated with increased renal oxidative stress demonstrated by urinary 8-F(2alpha)-isoprostane excretion and NADPH oxidase activity, increased protein expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (63%) and fibronectin (181%), increased mRNA expression of the proinflammatory molecules monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1), as well as downregulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity (-44%) and protein expression. Return to normal salt had no effect on SBP or any of the measured parameters. Atorvastatin (30 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) significantly attenuated proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis and normalized renal oxidative stress, TGF-beta1, fibronectin, MCP-1 and LOX-1 expression, and eNOS activity and expression. Atorvastatin-treated rats showed a modest reduction in SBP that remained in the hypertensive range (174 +/- 8 mmHg). Atorvastatin combined with removal of high salt normalized SBP and proteinuria. These findings suggest that statins mitigate hypertensive renal injury by restoring the balance among NO, TGF-beta1, and oxidative stress and explain the added renoprotective effects observed in clinical studies using statins in addition to inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "93": "Doxorubicin efficacy in cancer therapy is hampered by the dose-dependent side effects, which may be overcome by reducing the drug's dose and increasing its efficacy. In the present work, we suggest that the activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway and of nitric-oxide (NO) synthase increases the doxorubicin efficacy in human colon cancer HT29 cells. To induce NF-kappaB, we took into account the effect of doxorubicin itself and of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin; as NF-kappaB inhibitors, we chose the sesquiterpene lactones parthenolide and artemisinin. Simvastatin increased the NF-kappaB activity and NO synthesis, elicited the tyrosine nitration of the multidrug resistance-related protein 3, and enhanced the doxorubicin intracellular accumulation and cytotoxicity. Simvastatin potentiated the effect of doxorubicin on the NF-kappaB pathway and the inducible NO synthase expression. The effects of simvastatin were due to the inhibition of the small G-protein RhoA and of its effector Rho kinase. Parthenolide and artemisinin prevented all of the statin effects by inducing RhoA/Rho kinase activation. On the other hand, they did not reduce the NF-kappaB translocation and doxorubicin intracellular content when RhoA was silenced by small interfering RNA (siRNA). It is interesting that RhoA siRNA was sufficient to increase NF-kappaB translocation, NO synthase activity, doxorubicin accumulation, and cytotoxicity also in non-stimulated cells. Our results suggest that artemisinin, a widely used antimalarial drug, may impair the response to doxorubicin in colon cancer cells; on the contrary, simvastatin and RhoA siRNA may represent future therapeutic approaches to improve doxorubicin efficacy, reducing the risk of doxorubicin-dependent adverse effects.",

    "98": "Ezetimibe (EZB) lowers cholesterol by blocking cholesterol absorption in the intestine. Data with EZB are limited in HIV-infected patients. We enrolled HIV-infected adults in this prospective, noncontrolled, single-center pilot study if their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was not at goal despite therapy with a statin. Stable protease inhibitor (PI)-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and a low-dose statin were required for inclusion. The primary endpoint was LDL reduction at 18 weeks. In a subgroup of patients on lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), trough concentrations were obtained before and after addition of EZB. Twenty patients were enrolled; 12 (60%) men, 18 (90%) African American. HAART included ritonavir (RTV)-boosted PIs in 17 (85%) patients; 3 (15%) were on nelfinavir. Mean percent changes from baseline in LDL were -10.9%, -12.2%, and -12.4% at weeks 6, 12, and 18, respectively (p < 0.05 for each time period vs. baseline). Mean percent changes from baseline in total cholesterol (TC) were -11.1%, -9.6%, and 9.1% at weeks 6, 12, and 18, respectively (p < 0.05 at each time period vs. baseline). No significant changes in triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, and LPV/r concentrations were seen. One patient experienced elevated creatine phosphokinase possibly related to study medication; no other adverse effects were seen. Addition of EZB to low-dose statin effectively lowers LDL and TC and appears to be safe and well tolerated.", 
    "99": "Current best practice to reduce cardiovascular disease involves evaluating patients' global cardiovascular risk profiles and devising treatment strategies accordingly. Despite the proven efficacy of this approach, very few physicians are adequately assessing risk, and consequently patients are failing to achieve desired treatment targets. Modifying lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, and cessation of smoking, remains one of the simplest and most potent means of reducing risk. Newly emerging evidence suggests that moderate physical activity (such as brisk walking for 30 minutes a day), eg, by raising levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, improves endothelial function and enhances vascular repair. However, patients remain remarkably reluctant to lifestyle changes, even in the face of overt, life-threatening disease. Statin treatment reduces cardiovascular morbidity and death in both primary and secondary prevention studies. However, over 90% of adults at high risk for coronary heart disease fail to achieve target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in spite of statin therapy. Similarly, only about 37% of patients with hypertension meet blood pressure targets. Antihypertensive drugs achieve different levels of cardioprotection. Mounting evidence links regimens containing beta-blockers or diuretics with higher incidence of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers appear to confer extra protection on target organs on top of blood pressure reduction. The ONTARGET Trial Program is designed to clarify the importance of this effect. Educating patients, raising physicians' awareness, and implementing effective and safe treatment regimens are all necessary steps to bring about the much-needed improvements in cardiac health outcomes.", 
    "100": "Endothelial cells control vascular homeostasis by generating paracrine factors that regulate vascular tone, inhibit platelet function, prevent adhesion of leukocytes, and limit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle. The dominant factor responsible for many of those effects is endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO). Endothelial dysfunction characterized by enhanced inactivation or reduced synthesis of NO, alone or in combination, is seen in conjunction with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction can promote vasospasm, thrombosis, vascular inflammation, and proliferation of the intima. Vascular oxidative stress and increased production of reactive oxygen species contributes to mechanisms of vascular dysfunction. Oxidative stress is mainly caused by an imbalance between the activity of endogenous pro-oxidative enzymes (such as NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase or the mitochondrial respiratory chain) and antioxidant enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, heme oxygenase, thioredoxin peroxidase/peroxiredoxin, catalase and paraoxonase). In addition, small-molecular-weight antioxidants might have a role in the defense against oxidative stress. Increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species reduce bioactive NO through chemical inactivation, forming toxic peroxynitrite, which in turn can uncouple endothelial NO synthase to form a dysfunctional superoxide-generating enzyme that contributes further to oxidative stress. The role of oxidative stress in vascular dysfunction and atherogenesis, and strategies for its prevention are discussed.", 
    "101": "Statins, in addition to their beneficial lipid modulation effects, exert a variety of several so-called \"pleiotropic\" actions that may result in clinical benefits. Rosuvastatin, the last agent of the class to be introduced, has proved remarkably potent in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. At present, no large-scale primary or secondary prevention clinical trials document either its long-term safety or its effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular events. A substantial number of experimental and clinical studies have indicate favorable effects of rosuvastatin on endothelial function, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, inflammation, plaque stability, vascular remodeling, hemostasis, cardiac muscle, and components of the nervous system. Available data regarding the effects of rosuvastatin on renal function and urine protein excretion do not seem to raise any safety concerns. Whether the established \"pleiotropy\" and/or lipid-lowering efficacy of rosuvastatin may translate into reduced morbidity and mortality remains to be shown in ongoing clinical outcome trials.", 
    "102": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is characterized by infiltration of monocyte derived cells in the intima of the vessel wall. We hypothesized that accumulation of these cells is caused partly by an altered monocyte transmigration process in CAD. To gain insight into this issue we applied the skin blister method that allows collection of in vivo transmigrated cells at sites of local inflammation. Nineteen patients with stable CAD and 19 matched controls were enrolled. Markers of inflammation and gradients of chemokines, as well as adhesion molecule expression and up-regulation capacity, were studied. The expression of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-10, was similar in patients and controls, indicating that patients were in a stable phase of the disease. Expression of adhesion molecules, CD11b and very late activation antigen-4, on peripheral monocytes did not differ between patients and controls. However, following in vivo transmigration, monocytes in patients with CAD had a significantly reduced expression and mobilization of CD11b. The effect on CD11b could not be reproduced by in vitro stimulation with blister fluid, representing a local inflammatory milieu, or in an in vitro system of transmigration. These findings point towards differences in monocyte CD11b expression and availability at an inflammatory site between patients with CAD and healthy controls.", 
    "103": "LV (left ventricular) remodelling is the basic mechanism of HF (heart failure) following MI (myocardial infarction). Although there is evidence that pro-inflammatory cytokines [including TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor-alpha) and IL-6 (interleukin-6)] are involved in the remodelling process, only little is known about the role of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10. As accumulating evidence has revealed that statins possess anti-inflammatory properties, the aim of the present study was to elucidate the effect of atorvastatin on the modulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and its effect on LV function in rats with HF subsequent to MI. Rats with MI, induced by permanent LAD (left anterior descending) branch coronary artery ligation, were treated for 4 weeks with atorvastatin (10 mg x kg(-1) of body weight x day(-1) via oral gavage) starting on the first day after induction of MI. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization 4 weeks after MI induction. Membrane-bound and soluble fractions of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 protein, the TNF-alpha/IL-10 ratio, serum levels of MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) as well as myocardial macrophage infiltration were analysed. Treatment with atorvastatin significantly improved post-MI LV function (fractional shortening, +120%; dP/dt(max), +147%; and LV end-diastolic pressure, -27%). Furthermore atorvastatin treatment markedly decreased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and MCP-1, reduced myocardial infiltration of macrophages and significantly increased myocardial and serum levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Thus the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was shifted in the anti-inflammatory direction, as shown by a significantly decreased TNF-alpha/IL-10 ratio. Atorvastatin ameliorated early LV remodelling and improved LV function in rats with HF subsequent to MI. Our study suggests that the modulation of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines towards the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 is one salutary mechanism underlying how atorvastatin influences post-MI remodelling and thus improves LV function.",

This slow increase in variation and the modest increase in mean cholesterol level, about 2% per year, suggest that most of the variation in the study is due to short-term biological and analytic variability. Our calculations suggest that, for patients with levels that are 0.5 mmol/L or more (> or =19 mg/dL) under target, monitoring is likely to detect many more false-positive results than true-positive results for at least the first 3 years after treatment has commenced.",

It is well established that statins reduce cholesterol levels and prevent coronary heart disease. Moreover, evidence suggests that statins have additional properties such as endothelial protection via actions on the nitric oxide synthetase system as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects. There is evidence that all these actions might have potential therapeutic implications not only in stroke, but also in various neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and primary brain tumors. In this review, we summarize the protective effects of statins on various neurological diseases. Currently available data suggest that statins are safe and effective in the treatment of these neurological disorders, although further experiments and new data are required.", 
    "129": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the developed world. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease commonly coexist, which multiplies the overall or absolute risk of clinical events. Furthermore, evidence from observational and intervention trials suggest that the numerical risk associated with factors such as cholesterol level and blood pressure increases continuously. These findings concur with results from large-scale clinical trials showing that clinical benefits can be achieved with lowering cholesterol levels, irrespective of the initial levels. Cardiovascular risk factors have been shown to adversely influence vascular endothelial function. In particular, reduced bioavailability of endothelial-dependent nitric oxide production as a result of enhanced oxidative stress represents a common pathological mechanism of cardiovascular risk factors. This contributes to the observation that risk factors increase the overall risk of clinical events in an apparent additive fashion. Treatment guidelines now reflect these advances in our knowledge of risk factors by encouraging approaches that aim to reduce absolute risk, rather than addressing single risk factors in isolation. In response to this, a single pill combination of a calcium channel antagonist and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) has emerged as a means of addressing the suboptimal rates of goal attainment for concomitant hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Moreover, it can be viewed as a new therapeutic approach that seeks to comprehensively manage risk factors and enhance cardiovascular protection for patients at risk. Both experimental and clinical studies indicate that this approach is effective for reducing both the pathophysiological markers of atherosclerotic disease and its clinical consequences. This article provides an overview of the evidence for this new approach and recommends applications for use in clinical settings.",

However, many factors, such as low public awareness of symptoms, lack of urgency, or unavailability of brain imaging devices, are responsible for treatment delay. Delay between symptom onset and symptom diagnosis may preclude the use of tissue-plasminogen activator, which must be administered within a three-hour window from time of onset. Other therapeutic interventions for secondary stroke prevention after a TIA include the early use of antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole), and may involve procedures such as carotid endarterectomy and stenting.

    "142": "Statins, extensively used as cholesterol-lowering agents, have recently been identified as immunomodulatory agents. This study investigated the statins' mechanisms that target the autoimmune response in humans, and evaluated their therapeutic potential in multiple sclerosis. Our results demonstrated statin-mediated increases in suppressor of cytokine secretion (SOCS) 3 and suppressor of cytokine secretion 7, which negatively regulate the STAT/JAK signal transduction pathway and IL-6 and IL-23 gene expression in monocytes. Simvastatin also induced IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-27 production in monocytes, which together inhibited IL-17 transcription and secretion in CD4(+) T cells. IL-17-producing CD4(+) cells, referred to as Th17 cells, have recently been found to play a central role in the development of autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, simvastatin directly inhibited the expression of retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear hormone receptor C, a transcription factor that controls IL-17 production in CD4(+) T cells. This effect was reversed by mevalonic acid, a downstream metabolite of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, confirming that simvastatin's specific effect is through the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. These results provide evidence for the novel immunomodulatory mechanisms of statins, which selectively target the regulation of cytokine transcription involved in the development of the human autoimmune response. Based on the described immunomodulatory mechanisms, good safety profile and oral bioavailability, statins represent a promising therapeutic approach for multiple sclerosis and other chronic inflammatory diseases.",

It was sertraline that proved to be positive. Histologic examination taken from the site of positive drug-patch test referred to the original form of the drug-induced adverse side-effect (erythema exsudativum multiforme). Because of the bipolar affective disorder of the patient we executed oral rechallenge of the patient with the cutaneous negative culprit drugs. Oral rechallenge, in spite of being hazardous for the patient, is the only reliable method for detecting the causative agent. However, by the rechallenge with the drugs, even a partial dose of lamotrigine proved to be positive, after 3 hours erythema occurred, and 12 hours later scarlatiniform exanthema developed in spite of intravenous administration of steroid and antihistamine medication. The case's curiosity is that one causative agent proved to be positive by epicutaneous patch test meanwhile another drug was positive by the oral rechallenge. Finally, in spite of being consistent with the clinical picture, only one certain method cannot be totally sufficient and reliable in the investigation process of eliciting the causative agent in patients with adverse drug reactions.",

Low bone mineral density (BMD) is an important risk factor for fracture. Many studies have identified the lifestyle and health-related factors that correlate with BMD in Whites. Few studies have focused on non-Whites. The objective of the current analyses is to examine the lifestyle, anthropometric and health-related factors that are correlated with BMD in a population based cohort of Caribbean women of West African ancestry. We enrolled 340 postmenopausal women residing on the Caribbean Island of Tobago. Participants completed a questionnaire and had anthropometric measures taken. Hip BMD was measured by DXA. We estimated volumetric BMD by calculating bone mineral apparent density (BMAD). BMD was >10% and >25% higher across all age groups in Tobagonian women compared to US non-Hispanic Black and White women, respectively. In multiple linear regression models, 35-36% of the variability in femoral neck and total hip BMD respectively was predicted. Each 16-kg (one standard deviation (SD)) increase in weight was associated with 5% higher BMD; and weight explained over 10% of the variability of BMD. Each 8-year (1 SD) increase in age was associated with 5% lower BMD. Current use of both thiazide diuretics and oral hypoglycemic medication were associated with 4-5% higher BMD. For femoral neck BMAD, 26% of the variability was explained by a multiple linear regression model. Current statin use was associated with 5% higher BMAD and a history of breast feeding or coronary heart disease was associated with 1-1.5% of higher BMAD. In conclusion, African Caribbean women have the highest BMD on a population level reported to date for women. This may reflect low European admixture. Correlates of BMD among Caribbean women of West African ancestry were similar to those reported for U.S. Black and White women.",

This approach was performed using the design of a competitive inhibitor for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR). In a previous design for constrained peptides, a head-to-tail cyclic structure of peptide was used as a model of linear analog in searches for lead peptides with a structure close to an active conformation. Analysis of the conformational space occupied by the peptides suggests that an analogical approach can be applied for finding a lead peptide with an unconstrained structure in a recognized sequence via modeling a cycle using fixed residues of the peptide backbone. Using the space obtained by an analysis of the bioactive conformations of statins, eight cyclic peptides were selected for a peptide library based on the YVAE sequence as a recognized motif. For each cycle, the four models were assessed according to the design criterion (\"V\" parameter) applied for constrained peptides. Three cyclic peptides (FGYVAE, FPYVAE, and FFYVAE) were selected as lead cycles from the library. The linear FGYVAE peptide (IC(50) = 0.4 microM) showed a 1200-fold increase the inhibitory activity compared to the first isolated LPYP peptide (IC(50) = 484 microM) from soybean.

Three weeks later, the animals were treated with simvastatin for 2 weeks. The expression of aortic gap junctions in the non-diabetic (n=10), untreated diabetic (n=10), and simvastatin-treated diabetic animals (n=6) was analyzed. There was a >4-fold increase in serum cholesterol level and >50% increase in plaque areas in the diabetic mice, regardless of simvastatin treatment. Western blotting of aortae showed reduced expression of connexin37 (Cx37) and Cx40 in the diabetic mice, which were further decreased in the simvastatin-treated diabetic mice. Immunoconfocal microscopy showed that endothelial gap junctions made of Cx37 and Cx40 were both reduced in the untreated diabetic mice compared with the non-diabetic mice (decrease: Cx37, 41%; Cx40, 42%; both p<0.01). The reduction was greater in the simvastatin-treated mice (decrease in treated diabetic vs non-diabetic: Cx37, 61%; Cx40, 79%; both p<0.01; decrease in treated diabetic vs untreated diabetic: Cx37, 34%; Cx40, 63%; both p<0.01). Cx37 and Cx40 were decreased in the endothelium of plaque surface. Cx43 appeared in the medial layer and inner layer of the intima. All three connexins were rarely expressed in monocytes/macrophages inside the plaques. In conclusion, in apoE-deficient mice, streptozotocin-induced diabetes is associated with downregulation of endothelial Cx37 and Cx40 gap junctions.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), an inhibitor of transcription factor HNF1alpha, on rosuvastatin and bilirubin kinetics in human healthy volunteers. Both substances are substrates of OATP1B1. Twelve subjects with OATP1B1(*)1b/(*)1b genotype predicting high transport activity were recruited for this randomized, crossover study. Each subject received a single p.o. dose of 20 mg of rosuvastatin after 14 days of p.o. intake of either 500 mg of UDCA or placebo. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were determined on days 15 to 18 of each study period. Subjects were randomly assigned to UDCA or placebo group. Intake of UDCA led to a significant increase in rosuvastatin area under the curve (AUC)(0-72) from 128.5 ng/ml.h to 182.1 ng/ml.h(P = 0.008) compared with the control group. The oral clearance decreased from 155.2 l/h with placebo to 109.8 l/h with UDCA.

The degree of calcification was semi-quantitated from absent to severe. The study population included 219 patients (57 +/- 14 years; 129 males), divided into two pre-specified categories; bicuspid (n = 133) and tricuspid (n = 86) aortic valves. Baseline LV dimensions, aortic valve haemodynamics, and cholesterol profiles were similar between the two groups at baseline. Individuals with tricuspid aortic valves were older, more hypertensive, with higher degrees of MAC and AV calcification (P < 0.001).

Simvastatin (0.3 to 3 mg/kg) and manidipine (1 to 10 mg/kg) were given orally singly or together to normocholesterolemic rats once a day for seven consecutive days. At the end of treatment, systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured in conscious rats, and the lipid profile and other biochemical markers, such as thromboxane B(2), nitrite/nitrates and 6-keto-prostaglandin F(1alpha) (6-keto-PGF(1alpha)) were determined in the plasma. Hearts were then isolated, perfused with Krebs-Henseleit, and subjected to low flow ischemia-reperfusion injury. Post-ischemic recovery of left ventricular function was measured as left ventricular developed pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) were measured in the heart effluents. In conscious animals, simvastatin alone increased plasma 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) release while manidipine alone reduced systolic blood pressure with a slight sympathetic reflex increase in heart rate, and increased plasma nitrite/nitrates. The combined treatment produced the same effects, but significantly more marked, and accompanied by a significant reduction of thromboxane B(2). Combined treatment was also significantly more effective than the single drugs in protecting the hearts from ischemia-reperfusion injury, with inhibition of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and enhancement of 6-keto-PGF(1alpha) during reperfusion. These data show that simvastatin and manidipine interact positively in protecting the rat heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury, possibly through increased prostaglandin and nitric oxide formation by the vascular endothelial cells.",

In the kidneys of diabetic nephropathy, monomeric endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is thought to be overexpressed; and its dimerization is suppressed. In the present study, we investigated the expression of eNOS and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes mellitus KK-Ay/Ta mice treated with pitavastatin, one of the statins. The KK-Ay/Ta mice were divided into 3 groups and given pitavastatin intraperitoneally starting at 8 weeks of age for 8 weeks: pitavastatin 3 mg/(kg d) (n=5), pitavastatin 10 mg/(kg d) (n=5), and a control group (n=10). The urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR), urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, body weight, fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, and triglyceride were measured; and the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed. The eNOS, nitrotyrosine, and p47 phox were evaluated by immunohistochemical analyses and/or Western blot analyses. Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 messenger RNA expression in the kidneys was evaluated using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. Pitavastatin improved the levels of urinary ACR and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, and hemoglobin A1c. Protein levels of monomeric eNOS, nitrotyrosine, and p47 phox in the kidneys were decreased in the pitavastatin-treated groups. Guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase 1 messenger RNA expression was significantly increased in the pitavastatin groups. There were no significant changes in body weight, levels of fasting blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and blood pressure among all groups. Pitavastatin improved urinary ACR apparently because of suppression of eNOS uncoupling and its antioxidant effect in the kidneys of KK-Ay/Ta mice.",
