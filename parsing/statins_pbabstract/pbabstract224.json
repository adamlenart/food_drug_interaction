Patients were randomized to control group (n = 62) or to atorvastatin group (n = 62) who were administered atorvastatin 20 mg/d for 3 days before the surgery. Primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative AF. Secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, persistent AF at 1 month, and identification of the markers to predict inhospital postoperative AF.", 
    "2": "The incidence of AF was significantly lower in the atorvastatin group than in the control group (13% vs 27%, P = .04). The incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and persistent AF at 1 month was similar in comparisons between the groups. Postoperative peak N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels were significantly higher in the patients with AF (P = .03). Multivariate analysis identified pretreatment with atorvastatin as an independent factor associated with a significant reduction in postoperative AF (odds ratio 0.34, P = .04). Higher postoperative peak N-terminus pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were associated with the development of postoperative AF (odds ratio 1.02 per 100 pg/mL, P = .03).",

The safety profile was comparable with other drugs of the same class. 63 patients in the 10 mg group and 58 in the 10 mg Plus group discontinued treatment. The main reasons for discontinuation were adverse events (39 patients in the 10 mg group; 35 patients in the 10 mg Plus group) and loss to follow-up (13 patients in the 10 mg group; 9 patients in the 10 mg Plus group). The two most frequently reported adverse events were myalgia (34 patients, 3% respectively) and back pain (23 patients, 2% respectively).

    "31": "Cholesterol circulating levels are elevated in most of the patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. This review questions whether hypercholesterolaemia represents a cardiovascular risk in primary biliary cirrhosis and whether it should be treated. The published evidence indicates that hypercholesterolaemia in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis should be considered a cardiovascular risk factor only when other factors are present. Ursodeoxycholic acid the standard treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis improves the cholestasis and hereby lowers circulating levels of cholesterol. Primary biliary cirrhosis is not a contraindication to prescribe statins or fibrates to these patients. Interestingly, these two classes of drugs have been shown to improve not only the lipid profile but also the liver tests. In particular fibrates have been found to normalize liver tests in patients responding incompletely to ursodeoxycholic acid. Statins as well as fibrates possess specific anti-inflammatory properties which may be beneficial in primary biliary cirrhosis. In conclusion, hypercholesterolaemia in the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors does not require specific therapeutic intervention in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, statins as well as fibrates seem to have beneficial effects on the primary biliary cirrhosis itself and deserve formal testing within clinical trials.",

Unbound fraction, biliary excretion index (BEI), and unbound intrinsic biliary clearance (intrinsic Clbiliary') were determined for digoxin, pravastatin, and taurocholate in the absence or presence of BSA or BSA-FAF. BSA had little effect on the BEI or intrinsic Clbiliary' of these compounds. Surprisingly, BSA-FAF decreased both BEI and intrinsic Clbiliary' for digoxin and pravastatin, which represent low and moderately bound compounds, respectively. The BEI and intrinsic Clbiliary' of taurocholate, a highly bound compound, were not altered significantly by BSA-FAF. Neither BSA nor BSA-FAF had a discernable effect on the bile canalicular networks based on carboxydichlorofluorescein retention. Neither the addition of physiological concentrations of calcium nor the addition of fatty acids to BSA-FAF was able to restore the BEI or intrinsic Clbiliary' of the model compounds to similar values in the absence or presence of BSA. Careful consideration is warranted when selecting the type of BSA for addition to in vitro systems such as sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes.",

    "45": "Therapeutic goals for lipid lowering treatment in the prevention of ischemic heart disease are often not reached in clinical practice. Even the highest doses of statins do not guarantee good control of hypercholesterolemia in all patients. Therefore, new lipid lowering drugs are being investigated. One of them is ezetimibe - intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor. Treatment with ezetimibe results in significant reduction of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. It is hoped that concomitant treatment with ezetimibe and other lipid lowering drugs (particularly statins) will be more effective. In large randomized clinical trials, co-administration of ezetimibe with atorvastatin and simvastatin proved to be more effective in lowering cholesterol levels and reaching target therapeutic levels than treatment with statin alone. In addition, combined treatment with ezetimibe and simvastatin was more effective compared to treatment with today's most effectively used statin (rosuvastatin) alone. Reduction of statin dose, due to the combined treatment with ezetimibe, lowers the risk of adverse events. Results of the published studies suggest that ezetimibe is safe and when administered together with statin does not increase the risk of liver or muscle damage. Treatment with ezetimibe may be regarded as a new option in the management of patients who need lipid lowering treatment. (Cardiol J 2007; 14: 232-237).",

The addition of fenofibrate to statin monotherapy produced further benefits to the reduction in triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein levels, and caused an increase in high-density lipoprotein levels. All the treatment groups showed a significant decrease in the plasma fibrinogen levels. Plasma fibrinogen did not correlate with study parameters such as age, body weight, hemo-dynamic characteristics and lipoprotein levels. Statin monotherapy as well as its combination with fenofibrate produced a significant decrease in the fibrinogen levels.",

    "55": "Worldwide, approximately 200 million people currently have type II diabetes mellitus (DM), a prevalence that has been predicted to increase to 366 million by 2030. Rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and morbidity are particularly high in this population, representing a significant cost for health care systems. Type II DM patients generally carry a number of risk factors for CVD, including hyperglycemia, abnormal lipid profiles, alterations in inflammatory mediators and coagulation/thrombolytic parameters, as well as other 'nontraditional' risk factors, many of which may be closely associated with insulin resistance. Therefore, successful management of CVD associated with diabetes represents a major challenge to the clinicians. An effective way of tackling this problem is to detect the associated risk factors and to target treatment toward their improvement. Targeting hyperglycemia alone does not reduce the excess risk in diabetes, highlighting the need for aggressive treatment of other risk factors. Although the current use of statin therapy is effective at reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, residual risk remains for other independent lipid and nonlipid factors. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma appears to be closely involved in regulating risk markers at multiple levels. A relatively new class of therapeutic agents that activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, the thiazolidinedione insulin-sensitizing agents, is currently used to manage type II DM. These agents display a number of potential antiatherogenic properties, including effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as other beneficial nonlipid effects, such as regulating levels of mediators involved in inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Research data suggest that simple strategies combining thiazolidinediones and statins could have complementary effects on CVD risk-factor profiles in diabetes, alongside the ability to control glycemia.",

The noncoding rs4363657 SNP was in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium with the nonsynonymous rs4149056 SNP (r(2)=0.97), which has been linked to statin metabolism. The prevalence of the rs4149056 C allele in the population was 15%.

More than 60% of these myopathy cases could be attributed to the C variant. The association of rs4149056 with myopathy was replicated in the trial of 40 mg of simvastatin daily, which also showed an association between rs4149056 and the cholesterol-lowering effects of simvastatin.

In this study, the association of statin use with patient and graft survival was investigated in a cohort of 2041 first-time recipients of renal allografts between 1990 and 2003. Multivariable Cox regression demonstrated that statin use was independently associated with lower mortality rates. Twelve-year survival rates were 73% for statin users and 64% for nonusers (P = 0.055). The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality associated with statin use was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.48 to 0.86). Graft survival rates during the same time period were 76% for statin users and 70% for nonusers (P = 0.055). The adjusted hazard ratio for graft survival associated with statin use was 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.04). Results from marginal structural models were virtually identical. In summary, statin use was associated with prolonged patient survival, but no difference in graft survival was detected.

    "66": "Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is constitutively concentrated in the plasma membrane of the perivascular glial processes, and its expression is altered in certain pathological conditions associated with brain edema or altered glial migration. When astrocytes are grown in culture, they lose their characteristic star-like shape and AQP4 continuous plasma membrane localization observed in vivo. In this study, we differentiated primary astrocyte cultures with cAMP and lovastatin, both able to induce glial stellation through a reorganization of F-actin cytoskeleton, and obtained AQP4 selectively localized on the cell plasma membrane associated with an increase in the plasma membrane water transport level, but only cAMP induced an increase in AQP4 total protein expression. Phosphorylation experiments indicated that AQP4 in astrocytes is neither phosphorylated nor a substrate of PKA. Depolymerization of F-actin cytoskeleton performed by cytochalasin-D suggested that F-actin cytoskeleton plays a primary role for AQP4 plasma membrane localization and during cell adhesion. Finally, AQP4 knockdown does not compromise the ability of astrocytes to stellate in the presence of cAMP, indicating that astrocyte stellation is independent of AQP4.",

    "71": "The development and progression of atherosclerosis comprises various processes, such as endothelial dysfunction, chronic inflammation, thrombus formation, and lipid profile modification. Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors that have pleiotropic effects in addition to cholesterol-lowering properties. However, the mechanisms of these effects are not completely understood. Here, we investigated whether atorvastatin affects the levels of malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDALDL), an oxidized LDL, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), or platelet P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation, relative to that of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Forty-eight patients with coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia were separated into two groups that were administered with (atorvastatin group) or without (control group) atorvastatin. The baseline MDA-LDL level in all participants significantly correlated with LDL-C (r = 0.71, P < 0.01) and apolipoprotein B levels (r = 0.66, P < 0.01). Atorvastatin (10 mg/day) significantly reduced the LDL-C level within 4 weeks and persisted for a further 8 weeks of administration. Atorvastatin also reduced the MDA-LDL level within 4 weeks and further reduced it over the next 8 weeks. Platelet P-selectin expression did not change until 4 weeks of administration and then significantly decreased at 12 weeks, whereas the IL-6 level was gradually, but not significantly, reduced at 12 weeks. In contrast, none of these parameters significantly changed in the control group within these time frames. The reduction (%) in IL-6 between 4 and 12 weeks after atorvastatin administration significantly correlated with that of MDALDL and of platelet P-selectin (r = 0.65, P < 0.05 and r = 0.70, P < 0.05, respectively). These results suggested that the positive effects of atorvastatin on the LDL-C oxidation, platelet activation and inflammation that are involved in atherosclerotic processes are exerted in concert after lowering LDL-C.", 
    "72": "The biochemical and cellular changes that occur following the administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) are remarkably similar to that seen in idiopathic Parkinson's disease(PD). There is growing evidence indicating that reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and inflammation are a major contributor to the pathogenesis and progression of PD. Hence, we investigated whether 7-nitroindazole [neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor], edaravone (free radical scavenger), minocycline [inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor], fluvastatin [endothelial NOS (eNOS) activator], pitavastatin (eNOS activator), etodolac [cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor] and indomethacin (COX inhibitor) can protect against MPTP neurotoxicity in mice under the same conditions. For the evaluation of each drug, the levels of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA were quantified using HPLC with an electrochemical detector. Four administrations of MPTP at 1-h intervals to mice produced marked depletion of dopamine, DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) and HVA (homovanilic acid) in the striatum after 5 days. 7-Nitroindazole prevented dose-dependently a significant reduction in dopamine contents of the striatum 5 days after MPTP treatment. In contrast, edaravone, minocycline, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, etodolac and indomethacin did not show the neuroprotective effect on MPTP-induced striatal dopamine, DOPAC and HVA depletions after 5 days. The present study demonstrates that the overexpression of nNOS may play a major role in the neurotoxic processes of MPTP, as compared with the production of ROS, the overexpression of iNOS, the modulation of eNOS and the involvement of inflammatory response. Thus our pharmacological findings provide further information for progressive neurodegeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal pathway.",

Atherosclerosis imaging techniques including intravascular ultrasound, carotid ultrasound to measure carotid intima-media thickness, and cardiovascular MRI are established modalities for describing longitudinal changes in the quantity and quality of atherosclerotic plaque. An increasing number of clinical trials are using radiologic measures of subclinical atherosclerosis as surrogate end points in lieu of the traditional \"hard\" end points of myocardial infarction and death. This approach has great appeal, as improvements in atherosclerosis imaging now enable the characterization of early atheromas and positive remodeling within the vessel wall before the plaque becomes obstructive. Additional prospective data correlating these surrogate end points with hard outcomes are needed to determine whether atherosclerosis regression will be the major determinant of future treatment strategies.", 
    "86": "We previously found that statin users had a lower risk of advanced and possibly high-grade prostate cancer compared with nonusers. We hypothesize that statins' effects on cholesterol synthesis may explain those findings because prostate cancer cells exhibit cholesterol dysregulation. Thus, we investigated whether low plasma cholesterol is associated with prostate cancer overall and by stage and grade. Participants were drawn from the 18,018 members of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study who provided blood in 1993-1995. We ascertained 698 incident cases through January 2000. Controls were 698 men who had a PSA test and were matched to cases. Plasma cholesterol was measured enzymatically. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate multivariable ORs and 95% CIs of total, clinically organ-confined (n = 518), advanced (T3b or worse; n = 61), low-grade (Gleason sum < 7; n = 386) and high-grade (Gleason sum > or = 7, n = 247) disease. Low cholesterol (<25th percentile vs. > or =25th percentile) was not associated with total (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.72-1.20), organ-confined (OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.64-1.18) or low-grade (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.75-1.51) disease. However, men with low cholesterol had a lower risk of high-grade disease (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.39-0.98), especially if organ-confined (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29-0.99). The association for advanced disease appeared inverse, but number of cases was small (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.13-1.36). Associations remained after excluding cholesterol-lowering drug users.

On day 8, they received olmesartan medoxomil (10 mg) and pravastatin (10 mg) concurrently, and pharmacokinetic profiles were compared with those in each single-dose phase with regard to the SLCO1B1 genotypes (*1b/*1b, *1b/*15, and *15/*15). In the single-dose phase, the mean C (max) and AUC(0-24) of olmesartan tended to be higher in *15/*15 subjects than in *1b/*1b subjects, while the mean CL( t )/F (+/-SD) in *15/*15 subjects was significantly lower than that in *1b/*1b subjects. No statistically significant differences were observed in any pharmacokinetic parameters between single-dose and co-administration phases for both pravastatin and RMS-416. These results suggest that OATP1B1 plays a role in the pharmacokinetics of olmesartan, and the co-administration of olmesartan does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin or its metabolite, RMS-416, although larger scale clinical studies are needed to confirm these observations due to the small sample size in the present study.",

The effect of pravastatin on the apoptotic status of human AAA explants was also examined. Total MMP-9 content did not differ in human AAA explants incubated in vitro in the presence or absence of pravastatin (10-6 mol/L) for 48 h. TIMP-1 levels were significantly increased in pravastatin-incubated AAA explants, but TIMP-2 production was not modified by pravastatin. Western blot experiments showed that, whereas Bax expression was increased in pravastatin-incubated AAA explants, the expression of Bcl-2 was not modified. On the other hand, the ratio of the expression of Bax to Bcl-2, an apoptotic index, was not modified by pravastatin. In the human AAA explants, the increase in Bax expression, but not the increase in TIMP-1 expression elicited by pravastatin, was reversed by L-mevalonate, a downstream HMG-CoA reductase metabolite, suggesting that the expression of Bax and TIMP-1 followed HMG-CoA reductase-dependent and -independent pathways, respectively. In conclusion, pravastatin increases both TIMP-1 and Bax expression in human AAA explants without changes in either MMP-9 activity or the apoptotic status.",

Our results showed that combination of BBR with simvastatin (SIMVA) increased the LDLR gene expression to a level significantly higher than that in monotherapies. In the treatment of food-induced hyperlipidemic rats, combination of BBR (90 mg/[kg d], oral) with SIMVA (6 mg/[kg d], oral) reduced serum LDL cholesterol by 46.2%, which was more effective than that of the SIMVA (28.3%) or BBR (26.8%) monotherapy (P < .01 for both) and similar to that of SIMVA at 12 mg/(kg d) (43.4%). More effective reduction of serum triglyceride was also achieved with the combination as compared with either monotherapy. Combination of BBR with SIMVA up-regulated the LDLR messenger RNA in rat livers to a level about 1.6-fold higher than the monotherapies did. Significant reduction of liver fat storage and improved liver histology were found after the combination therapy. The therapeutic efficacy of the combination was then evaluated in 63 hypercholesterolemic patients. As compared with monotherapies, the combination showed an improved lipid-lowering effect with 31.8% reduction of serum LDL cholesterol (P < .05 vs BBR alone, P < .01 vs SIMVA alone). Similar efficacies were observed in the reduction of total cholesterol as well as triglyceride in the patients.

Variables correlated with graft stenosis and bypass repair included: procedure indication, conduit type (saphenous vs nonsaphenous vein; reversed vs nonreversed orientation), prior bypass graft failure, postoperative ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.85, and interpretation of the first duplex surveillance study as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\" based on peak systolic velocity (PSV) and velocity ratio (Vr) criteria.",

Characteristics predictive of duplex-detected stenosis leading to intervention (PSV: 443 +/- 94 cm/s; Vr: 8.6 +/- 9) were: \"abnormal\" initial duplex testing indicating moderate (PSV: 180-300 cm/s, Vr: 2-3.5) stenosis (P < .0001), non-single segment saphenous vein conduit (P < .01), warfarin drug therapy (P < .01), and redo bypass grafting (P < .001).

Before one can make this conclusion, a careful analysis of the trial, including the subjects included and the surrogate end point studied, is required. The results of this study should be taken in context with those of many other studies showing that lipid lowering by many approaches is beneficial.

    "120": "Metabolic syndrome (MS), characterized by low-grade inflammation, confers an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Statins, in addition to having lipid-lowering effects, have pleiotropic effects and decrease biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. The Treating to New Target Study showed a greater decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and cardiovascular events with atorvastatin 80 mg versus 10 mg in patients with MS with coronary heart disease. However, part of this benefit could be caused by the greater pleiotropic effects of the higher dose of atorvastatin. The dose-response effect of atorvastatin on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress has not been investigated in subjects with MS. Thus, the dose-response effect of atorvastatin on biomarkers of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], matrix metalloproteinase-9, and nuclear factor-kappaB [NF-kB] activity) and oxidative stress (oxidized LDL, urinary nitrotyrosine, F2-isoprostanes, and monocyte superoxide release) was tested in a randomized double-blind clinical trial in subjects with MS. Seventy subjects were randomly assigned to receive placebo or atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg/day for 12 weeks. A strong dose-response (atorvastatin 10 compared with 80 mg, p <0.05) was observed for changes in total, LDL (32% and 44% reduction), non-high-density lipoprotein (28% and 40% reduction), and oxidized LDL cholesterol (24% and 39% reduction) at atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg, respectively. Hs-CRP, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and NF-kB significantly decreased in the 80-mg atorvastatin group compared with baseline. In conclusion, this randomized trial of subjects with MS showed the superiority of atorvastatin 80 mg compared with its 10-mg dose in decreasing oxidized LDL, hs-CRP, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and NF-kB activity.",

Most acute coronary events occur in association with proximal nonobstructive atherosclerotic plaque. Multislice computed tomography detects both obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and proximal atherosclerotic plaque with high accuracy. The association of Framingham risk score with obstructive CAD and proximal atherosclerotic plaque was tested. Coronary multislice computed tomography was performed in 295 patients (61% men, mean age 54 +/- 13 years) without documented CAD referred for evaluation of cardiac symptoms. Framingham risk score was computed and patients were stratified according to 10-year risk (n = 213 [72%] low, n = 74 [25%] intermediate, and n = 8 [3%] high). Obstructive CAD was defined as > or =50% stenosis in > or =1 epicardial coronary artery. Proximal atherosclerotic plaque was defined as calcified or noncalcified plaque in the left main or proximal left anterior descending artery. In the low- and intermediate-Framingham risk score groups, there was a high frequency of proximal atherosclerotic plaque (44% and 75%) and obstructive CAD (16% and 34%), although both findings were more prevalent in the high-Framingham risk score group (63% for atherosclerotic plaque, 88% for obstructive CAD), respectively. Proximal atherosclerotic plaque was noncalcified in approximately 13 of patients. In women (n = 114) and younger (<55 years) patients (n = 148), most (93% and 91%, respectively) had a low Framingham risk score. There were 48 women and 51 younger patients with proximal atherosclerotic plaque, of whom only 40% (in each group) were on statin therapy. In conclusion, of patients with a low and intermediate Framingham risk score, a significant proportion had proximal atherosclerotic plaque or obstructive CAD.", 
    "122": "Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is a disease of unknown origins that involves tissue ischemia and fibrosis in the skin and internal organs such as the lungs. The tissue ischemia is due to a lack of functional blood vessels and an inability to form new blood vessels. Bone marrow--derived circulating endothelial progenitor cells play a key role in blood vessel repair and neovascularization. Scleroderma patients appear to have defects in the number and function of circulating endothelial progenitor cells. Scleroderma patients also develop fibrotic lesions, possibly as the result of tissue ischemia. Fibroblast-like cells called fibrocytes that differentiate from a different pool of bone marrow-derived circulating progenitor cells seem to be involved in this process. Manipulating the production, function, and differentiation of circulating progenitor cells represents an exciting new possibility for treating scleroderma.",

We thus sought to assess the influence of rosuvastatin on clopidogrel antiplatelet action in high-risk (HR) cardiovascular patients. To set the level of platelet inhibition by combined antithrombotic treatments we retrospectively studied two populations of HR patients, one under aspirin alone, the other under aspirin plus rosuvastatin, before and after addition of clopidogrel. The effects of rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin were then prospectively investigated in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), under clopidogrel and aspirin treatment. Light transmission platelet aggregation (LTA) was studied in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (5 microM) or arachidonic acid (0.5 mM). The inhibitory effect of clopidogrel in reducing ADP-induced LTA was similar in the two HR groups of patients. No difference in ADP-induced platelet aggregation was observed in the two PCI groups of patients with either atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. In conclusion, rosuvastatin does not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel in patients with cardiovascular disease.",

They were assigned to receive a daily dosage of atorvastatin based on their initial LDL-C levels. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving the LDL-C goal after 24 weeks of treatment. No changes were made in prescribed atorvastatin dosage.

Atorvastatin reduced the levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides by 29%, 35%, 3% and 22%, respectively, and all statin doses were well tolerated. Thus, individualizing the starting dose of atorvastatin according to baseline and target LDL-C levels, allowed a high proportion of type 2 diabetic patients to achieve the target within 24 weeks.",

Under both these conditions this effect was partially inhibited by L-NAME, tetraethylammonium, apamin + charybdotoxin (only administered together), or mevalonic acid. The combination of L-NAME with any of the other 3 treatments completely inhibited the effect of rosuvastatin, but indomethacin, clotrimazol, glibenclamide, charybdotoxin, or apamin alone had no effect. Therefore, the relaxation induced by rosuvastatin, even in the absence of endothelium, is partially related to 2 different mechanisms, one that is isoprenoid dependent and NO mediated and the other that is tied to the opening of Ca( 2+)-dependent K(+) channels of the slow subfamily.",

Chronic inflammation may alter DNA-mismatch repair (MMR) systems in mesenchymal cells, but is not defined in Crohn's disease (CD) and its associated intestinal remodeling and stricture formation. We determined whether DNA-MMR alteration plays a role in the pathogenesis of CD tissue remodeling. Control and CD bowel tissues were used to generate primary cultures of muscularis mucosa myofibroblasts, which were assessed directly or following stimulation with TNF-alpha/LPS or H2O2. MutS homolog (MSH)2, MSH3, and MSH6 expression in tissues and myofibroblasts was determined. Immunohistochemical staining revealed an increased expression of MSH2 in CD muscularis mucosa and submucosal tissues compared with controls or uninvolved CD tissue, and MSH2 expression was increased in CD myofibroblasts compared with control cells. TNF-alpha/LPS and H2O2 further enhanced MSH2 expression in both control and CD cells, which were decreased by simvastatin. There were no significant changes in MSH3 and MSH6 expression. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67 staining of CD tissue revealed increased proliferation in the muscularis mucosa and submucosa of chronically inflamed tissues, and enhanced proliferation was seen in CD myofibroblasts compared with controls. Simvastatin reversed the effects of inflammatory stress on the DNA-MMR and inhibited proliferation of control and CD myofibroblasts. Gene silencing with MSH2 siRNA selectively decreased CD myofibroblast proliferation. These data demonstrate a potential role for MSH2 in the pathogenesis of nonneoplastic mesenchymal cell accumulation and intestinal remodeling in CD chronic inflammation.",

Due to the presence of multiple drugs in the same formulation, there is a strong likelihood of interaction among the drugs and/or their products. In a previous study, we observed formation of a number of interaction/degradation products from atenolol and lisinopril in the presence of aspirin. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to characterize the resolved products using high resolution mass spectrometric and fragmentation analyses using a LC-MS/TOF system. Initially, studies were carried out on the drugs (atenolol, lisinopril and aspirin) to establish their complete fragmentation pattern. These studies were then extended to degraded samples to postulate the structures of interaction/degradation products. The characterized structures were justified through mechanistic explanations.",

Evidence for the effect of statins on CVD in the diabetic population in low-risk populations (e.g., Japanese) is limited. We evaluated the effect of pravastatin on risk reduction of CVD related to baseline glucose status in a primary prevention setting. The Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese (MEGA) Study, in patients with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia (220-270 mg/dL), showed that low-dose pravastatin significantly reduced the risk for CVD by 26%. This exploratory subanalyses examined the efficacy of diet plus pravastatin on CVD in 2210 patients with abnormal fasting glucose (AFG, including 1746 patients with DM and 464 patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) at 5 years in the MEGA Study. CVD was threefold higher in AFG patients (threefold higher in DM, and twofold higher in IFG) compared with normal fasting glucose (NFG) patients in the diet group. Diet plus pravastatin treatment significantly reduced the risk of CVD by 32% (hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.96, number needed to treat, 42) in the AFG group compared with the diet alone group, and no significant interaction between AFG and NFG (interaction P=0.85) was found. Safety problems were not observed during long-term treatment with pravastatin.

Thus, more patients will be titrated to higher doses of statins in order to reach the aggressive targets of low-density lipoprotein- cholesterol reduction. However, aggressive treatment with high statin doses has increased the risk of statin-induced myopathy. The incidence of myopathy in cohort studies and in randomized trials has been low, supporting the good safety profile of statin drugs. However, muscle effects seem to be more frequent in clinical practice. Of all statin users, approximately 1% to 5% suffers from muscular symptoms caused by medication. This potentially reduces the compliance toward treatment and number of patients reaching their treatment targets due to withdrawal of therapy. Thus, novel biomarkers are needed for prediction or improved diagnoses of statin-induced side effects. This would potentially increase the quality of life of patients and improve treatment results. Using lipidomic analysis, we found that the plasma lipidomic changes following simvastatin treatment correlate with the muscle expression of the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein. Intriguingly, these results suggest that the plasma lipidomic profile may serve as a highly sensitive biomarker of statin-induced metabolic alterations in muscle and may thus allow us to identify patients who should be treated with a lower dose to prevent a possible toxicity.",

It was recently demonstrated in enterocytes of wild-type mice that intracellular amyloid-beta expression is enhanced in response to a high-fat diet made up of SFA and cholesterol. Intestinally derived amyloid-beta may be associated with postprandial lipoproteins in response to dietary fats and could be a key regulator in chylomicron metabolism. The present study was designed to investigate the role of cholesterol in modulating amyloid-beta abundance in enterocytes. Wild-type mice were fed a low-fat diet supplemented with 2 % (w/w) cholesterol. The effects of cholesterol absorption inhibition and cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition utilising ezetimibe and atorvastatin, respectively, were also studied. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was utilised to determine enterocytic amyloid-beta homeostasis. We found that enterocytic amyloid-beta concentration was significantly attenuated in mice fed the 2 % (w/w) cholesterol diet. However, blocking cholesterol absorption reversed the cholesterol-feeding effect. Consistent with a suppressive effect of cholesterol on enterocytic amyloid-beta abundance, atorvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, enhanced amyloid-beta. However, providing exogenous cholesterol abolished the atorvastatin-induced effect. In contrast to the suppression of enterocytic amyloid-beta by dietary cholesterol, mice fed a diet enriched in SFA had markedly greater abundance. Collectively, the findings suggest that exogenous and endogenous cholesterol reduce amyloid-beta concentration in enterocytes by suppressing production, or enhancing secretion associated with postprandial lipoproteins. Intestinally derived amyloid-beta will contribute to the pool of plasma protein and may influence cerebral amyloid homeostasis by altering the bi-directional transfer across the blood-brain barrier.",

One reasonable explanation resides in the fact that statins have only limited effectiveness on hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL cholesterol, and they do not normalize the LDL size-distribution pattern. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha agonists, which include fibrates, normalize this atherogenic lipid profile, as well as several cardiovascular risk markers associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.

Outcome trials of PPARalpha agonists have demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular morbidity in patients with diabetes and in those with the metabolic syndrome; plaque progression is diminished, diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy are counteracted and amputation-risk decreased. The combination of fibrates with statins improves overall lipoprotein profile further. PPARalpha agonists seem particularly indicated in patients with diabetes who have residual dyslipidemia (high triglyceride and/or low HDL) despite receiving statin therapy, and patients who are nondiabetic, overweight, insulin-resistant and who have hypertriglyceridemia and/or low HDL cholesterol and chronic inflammation.", 
    "163": "This Practice Point commentary discusses a meta-analysis by Strippoli et al. that included 50 randomized and quasi-randomized trials of statins in patients with different stages of kidney disease (predialysis, dialysis and transplantation; n = 30,144). The authors found that statins safely reduced lipid concentrations and the risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality, but that the agents had no effect on all-cause mortality overall and had uncertain renoprotective effects. The analysis was comprehensive and well executed. A decreased risk of all-cause mortality with statins was found in studies of predialysis patients but not in studies of renal transplant recipients or patients on chronic dialysis. Statin doses used in the trials were well tolerated and safe in all subgroups of patients with chronic kidney disease; therefore, we feel that statin use to maintain LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) should be initiated to potentially decrease cardiovascular risk in such patients. The benefits of statin therapy on all-cause mortality and the clinically significant benefits of this treatment on progression of kidney disease are still unclear, and additional trial evidence in patients with chronic kidney disease is needed.",

DMMB, and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to quantify proteoglycan and gene expression of BMP-2, aggrecan and collagen type II, respectively. Noggin or mevalonate was used to investigate the mechanism of the effect of simvastatin on rat IVD cells.", 
    "168": "Simvastatin significantly upregulated BMP-2 mRNA expression, followed by aggrecan and type II collagen gene expression and proteoglycan content in rat IVD cells. Moderate dose (500 ng/mL) of noggin completely hindered the expression of aggrecan and collagen type II induced by simvastatin on day 7, but not on day 14. The upregulated type II collagen expression was blocked with 3 mug/mL of noggin on day 14, whereas aggrecan levels remained unchanged. Lastly, simvastatin appeared to facilitate BMP-2, aggrecan, and type II collagen gene expression by inhibiting the production of mevalonate as evidenced that the anabolic effect was completely reversed with the addition of mevalonate.",

    "170": "Experimental studies suggest an enhanced endothelial and platelet nitric oxide (NO) generation after statin treatment, possibly due to increased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity and protein levels. In parallel with experimental research, statins were shown to increase the forearm blood flow independently of serum cholesterol in humans. However, it was not possible to correlate blood flow changes with eNOS levels in these studies due to limitations in obtaining arterial samples. Hence, we investigated changes in eNOS activity, mRNA and protein levels after statin treatment in human platelets, which are readily accessible unlike arteries.", 
    "171": "In vitro bleeding times were measured in 22 patients by stimulating platelets with collagen-epinephrine or collagen-ADP. To assess platelet eNOS activity, the bleeding times were also determined after incubating platelets with L-arginine. The measurements were repeated following 14 days of pravastatin (40 mg/day) treatment. Platelet-rich plasma was collected before and after statin treatment to evaluate eNOS mRNA (semiquantitative RT-PCR) and protein levels (Western blotting).", 
    "172": "The basal bleeding time was prolonged by 24 +/- 3% (mean +/- SE) when the samples were incubated with 500 microM of L-arginine. The NOS inhibitor L-N(5)-(I-iminoethyl)ornithine reversed this effect, suggesting that it was mediated by NO. After statin treatment, the NO-mediated prolongation of the bleeding time with 500 microM of L-arginine was significantly potentiated (to 44 +/- 10%). Despite enhanced eNOS activity, there was no significant change in platelet eNOS mRNA and protein levels after statin treatment.",

    "176": "We provide evidence that fluvastatin is a potent inducer of apoptosis and suppresses proliferation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells in vitro. Such effects are mediated by direct targeting of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, as evidenced by the suppression of phosphorylation/activation of Akt, resulting in inhibition of its downstream effectors, mTOR and p70 S6 kinase. In addition, fluvastatin blocks the mTOR-dependent phosphorylation/deactivation of the translational repressor eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein, leading to the formation of eIF4E-binding protein-eIF4E complexes that suppress initiation of cap-dependent mRNA translation. Importantly, inhibition of p70 S6 kinase activity by fluvastatin results in the up-regulation of expression of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a tumor suppressor protein with inhibitory effects on the translation initiation factor eIF4A, suggesting a mechanism for the generation of antitumor responses.", 
    "177": "Altogether, our findings establish that fluvastatin exhibits potent anti-RCC activities via inhibitory effects on the Akt/mTOR pathway and raise the possibility that combinations of statins and Akt inhibitors may be of future therapeutic value in the treatment of RCC.",

A total of 515/1944 (27%) patients were statin users. Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was assessed preoperatively at 1, 2 and 3 days after surgery. Outcome measures were postoperative AKI and long-term mortality. Postoperative kidney injury was defined as a >10% decrease in CrCl on Day 1 or 2, compared to the baseline. Recovery of kidney function was defined as a CrCl >90% of the baseline value at Day 3 after surgery. Multivariable Cox regression analysis, including baseline cardiovascular risk factors, baseline CrCl and propensity score for statin use, was applied to evaluate the influence of statins on early postoperative kidney injury and long-term survival.",

Age, hypertension, suprarenal cross-clamping and baseline CrCl predicted the development of kidney injury during the postoperative period. The incidence of kidney injury was similar among statin users and non-users (29% versus 25%, OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.9-1.5). However, if kidney function deteriorated, statin use was associated with increased odds of complete kidney function recovery (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0-3.8). During a mean follow-up of 6.24 years, half of the patients died (55%).

The combination of the 2 drugs is highly effective in reducing total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and with a positive profile on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, there are no data as yet about the clinical effectiveness of the addition of ezetimibe on statin therapy and whether this provides a further reduction of cardiovascular events. The answer to the clinical hard endpoints question will be provided in 2012 by the IMPROVE-IT trial comparing the effectiveness of simvastatin 40 mg plus ezetimibe versus simvastatin 40 mg on 18,000 acute coronary syndrome patients. The ENHANCE study failed in its primary endpoint, carotid intima-media thickness reduction, but has various methodological weaknesses that makes it very difficult to accept the American College of Cardiology statement that ezetimibe should be the last resort after trying all other available treatments.",

It has the greatest efficacy compared with all other available statins on total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction, and also provides a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) better than atorvastatin. Imaging studies showed a regression of atheroma in secondary prevention patients using an intravascular ultrasound technique and a hold of progression in primary prevention patients using carotid intima-media thickness as a surrogate marker. The JUPITER trial, a primary prevention large-scale, prospective study to examine the role of statin therapy in individuals with raised C-reactive protein but normal LDL-C levels, was recently terminated early due to a significant reduction of events in the rosuvastatin group. Rosuvastatin has held its initial promises as a very potent statin, with favourable effects on HDL, showing a regression or a halt of the atherosclerotic burden and reducing cardiovascular events in low-risk patients.",

Furthermore, in the statin group the post-treatment levels of visfatin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly correlated (r = 0.57 and p < 0.01). The serum visfatin concentrations did not change significantly in either the monotherapy or statin pretreatment groups or in subgroups divided according to the baseline lipid variables. In both the ezetimibe monotherapy and ezetimibe plus atorvastatin groups the effect of ezetimibe on the lipid variables depended on the baseline lipid values. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol:high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio was consistently improved by ezetimibe in all groups or subgroups.",

Drugs classified as non-cardiological were received by 36.2% of patients. The optimal pharmacotherapy including four medications, one from each therapeutic class used in order to improve the prognosis of the patient (an antiplatelet drug, a beta-blocker, an ACE-I, statin), was received by a total of 45.8% of the participants, three medications by 31.7%, two medications by 15.8%, and one medication by 5.5%; 1.2% of the participants did not receive any medication from the four groups of drugs improving prognosis. What is worth noting, however, is the use of relatively small doses of ACE-I and beta-blockers. 69.9% of patients also received at least one symptomatic drug (a long-acting nitrate, a calcium channel blocker, a metabolic drug, molsidomine), including 39.7% - 1 drug, 22.7% - 2 drugs, 6.7% - 3 drugs, and 0.8% - 4 drugs from the classes mentioned above.",

Currently, the majority of patients receive drugs that improve prognosis. The awareness of the benefits of the use of combined treatment with all the drug groups and their appropriate doses should be higher. The significant percentage of patients with persisting symptoms of angina pectoris indicates the necessity to improve the efficacy of intervention also in this respect.", 
    "194": "Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) plays a crucial role in periodontal disease and is up-regulated by oral Gram-negative, pathogen-derived LPS. In this study, we reported that simvastatin, a 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, effectively inhibited LPS-stimulated MMP-1 as well as MMP-8 and MMP-9 expression by U937 mononuclear cells. Our studies showed that the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor inhibited LPS-stimulated MMP-1 expression, and addition of isoprenoid intermediate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) reduced the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on LPS-stimulated MMP-1 expression. We also demonstrated that simvastatin inhibited the activation of Ras and Rac, and the inhibition was abolished by addition of GGPP. The above results indicate that protein isoprenylation is involved in the regulation of MMP-1 expression by LPS and simvastatin. Moreover, we showed that simvastatin inhibited LPS-stimulated nuclear AP-1, but not NF-kappaB activity, and the inhibition was reversed by addition of GGPP. Simvastatin also inhibited LPS-stimulated ERK but not p38 MAPK and JNK. Finally, we showed that the inhibition of LPS-stimulated ERK activation by simvastatin was reversed by GGPP. Taken together, this study showed that simvastatin suppresses LPS-induced MMP-1 expression in U937 mononuclear cells by targeting protein isoprenylation-mediated ERK activation.", 
    "195": "Statins are highly effective and widely used lipid-lowering agents in clinical practice, that also display a number of pleiotropic properties beyond cholesterol lowering. Several trials have demonstrated that they reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in both primary and secondary prevention. Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) represent 2 world-wide epidemics. Recent evidence suggests that statins may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with HF, and specifically in the prevention of AF. The anti-arrhythmic mechanisms of statins regarding AF prevention in HF patients are not fully understood but are possibly related to their pleiotropic effects including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, atrial remodeling attenuation, ion channel stabilization, and autonomic nervous system regulation.", 
    "196": "Simvastatin is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway required for the biosynthesis of cholesterol and higher isoprenoids such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Apart from its capacity to lower cholesterol plasma levels and to protect against cardiovascular disease, simvastatin induces apoptosis in various cancer cells. We have generated human Namalwa Burkitt lymphoma cells that display general apoptosis resistance and hyperproliferation due to increased expression and proteolytic activity of 26S proteasomes in response to continuous treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. In these cells, simvastatin does not inhibit proteasome activity, but induces apoptosis, G2/M cell cycle arrest and accumulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1), and effectively inhibits hyperproliferation. These effects are reversed by the addition of GGPP. GGPP-dependent plasma membrane localization of the small GTPase RhoA that is required for RhoA-mediated oncogenic signaling is completely inhibited by simvastatin. Finally, bortezomib but not simvastatin induces accumulation and stabilization of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, which is known to confer resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells. Thus, simvastatin overcomes bortezomib-induced apoptosis resistance by inhibiting synthesis of GGPP and disrupting a GGPP-dependent survival pathway.",

Mild elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (<3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) following statin therapy do not appear to lead to significant liver toxicity over time. Other medications that lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and might be substituted for statins, may not improve morbidity and mortality.", 
    "198": "Statins possess pleiotropic effects in several tissues. Among them, their bone anabolic actions have been recently noted. We have proposed that Smad3, a TGF-beta-signaling molecule, is a promoter of bone formation. However, whether statins would affect TGF-beta-Smad3 pathway in osteoblasts is still unknown. The present study was performed to examine the effects of statin on Smad3 expression and cell apoptosis by employing mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 and rat osteoblastic UMR-106 cells. Statins (pitavastatin, mevastatin, and simvastatin) as well as alendronate increased the levels of Smad3 in MC3T3-E1 cells. The effects of pitavastatin on Smad3 levels were observed from 3 hours and later. Pitavastatin induced the expression of TGF-beta, and cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, antagonized the increased levels of pitavastatin on Smad3. On the other hand, pitavastatin antagonized dexamethasone- or etoposide-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and Smad3 inactivation by dominant negative Smad3 or an inhibition of endogenous TGF-beta action by SB431542 antagonized anti-apoptotic effects of pitavastatin, indicating that pitavastatin suppressed osteoblast apoptosis partly through TGF-beta-Smad3 pathway. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated for the first time that statin suppressed cell apoptosis partly through TGF-beta-Smad3 pathway in osteoblastic cells.",

All patients received cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. The progression of transplant vasculopathy was evaluated in paired donor and 6-month protocol biopsies. The primary efficacy variable was the progression of mean arterial intimal volume fraction (deltaVvintima/artery) evaluated with histomorphometry. The minimum sample size to detect a 50% reduction in the progression of deltaVvintima/artery was 62 patients per group. The secondary efficacy variable included the incidence of transplant vasculopathy evaluated according to Banff criteria.",

The deltaVvintima/artery was not different between treatment and placebo groups (6.9+/-8.2% vs. 6.9+/-7.4%, P=ns), whereas the incidence of transplant vasculopathy was lower in the fluvastatin group (7% vs. 33%; P=0.02). Because there was a discrepancy between the primary and secondary efficacy variables, post hoc analysis was performed to evaluate the reproducibility of both variables in a subset of 50 biopsies. The reproducibility of transplant vasculopathy was higher than the reproducibility of Vvintima/artery (kappa 0.86 vs. 0.33).",
