    "1": "Seventy-eight patients with stable angina pectoris and type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild elevated LDL-C were treated with (n=40) or without (n=38) statins for 12 months. Coronary artery angiography (CAG) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) were performed at baseline and after 12 months on lesion and reference segment to compare the plaque volume, lumen volume, vascular volume and remodeling index was calculated as vascular volume index (VVI) at lesion divided by VVI at reference segment One coronary lesion with 50%-70% stenosis was selected as target plaque in each patient.", 
    "2": "Baseline clinical and angiographic data were comparable between the two groups. After 12 months, LDL-C decreased 31.5% in statin group and remained unchanged in non-statin group. After 12 months, plaque volume was significantly increased [ (76.1 +/- 13.0) mm3 vs. (95.0 +/- 21.9) mm3 , P < 0.05], lumen volume was significantly decreased [(65.0 +/- 10.9) mm3 vs. (45.4 +/- 6.6) mm3, P < 0.05 ] and vascular volume remained unchanged in non-statins group; plaque volume was also significantly increased [(79.5 +/- 15.2) mm3 vs. (87.5 +/- 17.9) mm3 , P < 0.05] while lumen volume and vascular volume remained unchanged in statin group. Remodeling index (RI) remained unchanged in non-statin group but significantly increased in statin group (0.91 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.10, P < 0.05) after 12 months.",

    "4": "In the recently published The Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) mega-trial, rosuvastatin significantly reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of a small but significant increase in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The increased risk of new-onset diabetes was in keeping with a recent meta-analysis which suggested that statins, with the possible exception of pravastatin, marginally increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.", 
    "5": "Although the net effect of rosuvastatin was obviously very positive, we hypothesized that the addition of a bile aid sequestrant to a statin would not only further decrease lipid levels and potentially further decrease cardiovascular events but also protect against the development of diabetes. This is particularly relevant because the bile acid sequestrant, colesevelam, has recently been approved for therapy of diabetes.", 
    "6": "Colesevelam like other bile acid sequestrants lowers low-density lipoprotein levels by 16% and C-reactive protein by 22% beyond the reductions that occur with statin therapy alone. Bile acid sequestrants confer lipid-lowering, glucose-lowering, and anti-inflammatory benefits, and have been shown to reduce risk of cardiovascular events.", 
    "7": "Therefore, colesevelam should be the most effective and logical agent to add to a statin in the diabetic and insulin-resistant patient, because in addition to lowering cardiac risk it may prevent the development of diabetes, as well as improving glycaemic control in the established diabetic patient.", 
    "8": "Rosuvastatin has been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of dyslipidemia. The Cmax and AUC0-t of rosuvastatin were reported to be ~2 to 4 times higher in Chinese subjects compared with white subjects after administration of a single 1-mg/kg dose.",

    "10": "This open-label, randomized-sequence, 3-way crossover trial consisted of three 7-day treatment periods and two 10-day washout periods. Healthy volunteers were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 daily treatment regimens: rosuvastatin 5, 10, or 20 mg. To assess the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of rosuvastatin, blood samples were drawn before dosing (hour 0) on days 5, 6, and 7 and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hours after the final dose was administered on day 7. A validated HPLC-MS/MS method was used to determine rosuvastatin levels. A 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the plasma concentration-time profiles obtained for each volunteer. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the study via subject interview, vital signs, and blood sampling. Serious AEs were those requiring hospitalization, treatment discontinuation, or resulting in death.",

The mean (SD) steady-state Cmax was significantly greater after ro-suvastatin administration in the 20-mg group compared with the 5-mg group (37.69 [29.83] vs 6.17 [6.03] ng/mL; P = 0.04). The t1/2 was significantly greater in the 20-mg group (15.51 [6.43] hours) compared with the 5-mg group (5.65 [5.08] hours; P = 0.001) and the 10-mg group (8.58 [5.17] hours; P = 0.002). The mean AUC0-t was significantly greater in the 20-mg group compared with the 5-mg group (349.16 [257.20] vs 40.63 [39.31] ng/mL/h; P = 0.02). All AEs were considered by the investigators to be mild in intensity, with the exception of 2 cases of abdominal discomfort (1 man and 1 woman, both in the 5-mg dose group). Two women in the 20-mg group experienced dizziness and cold sweats simultaneously. In the 10-mg group, 1 woman had abdominal discomfort and nausea and 1 woman had jaw pain. All reported AEs were considered possibly related to study drug administration.", 
    "12": "In this small study in healthy Chinese volunteers, rosuvastatin systemic exposure appeared to be dose-proportional over the dosing range of 5 to 20 mg with multiple-dose administration. There was no accumulation of rosuvastatin in the body with the 5- and 10-mg doses. However, the results suggest that rosuva-statin might accumulate when the dose is increased to 20 mg. No serious AEs occurred in any of the 3 dosing groups.",

P-OM3 did not significantly change total VLDL-P or LDL-P concentrations relative to placebo, but large VLDL-P and intermediate-density lipoprotein particle (IDL-P) concentrations were lowered (P < .01 for both), and the large LDL-P concentration was increased (P < .0001). HDL-P concentration was reduced (P < .0001) as the result of a decrease in medium HDL-P.

Only 19% of patients had \u22651 lipid test in the 12 months and 32% in the 3 years before the event, and their 12-month mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 113 mg/dL. Thirty-four percent of patients were on statin therapy within the 3 years before event. The patient subgroup diagnosed with atherosclerosis had significantly more patients with cardiac testing, lipid monitoring, and statin therapy compared with patients with no previous diagnosis of atherosclerosis.",

    "22": "Because T2DM increases the risk of coronary atherosclerosis and CAD and new noninvasive techniques to assess CVD risk have gained considerable popularity, it is important to know how these tools relate to each other. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the extent of coronary artery calcification measured by MDCT, plasma OPG levels, baPWV and the established cardiovascular risk factors in Korean patients with T2DM. From November 2006 to December 2007, 110 asymptomatic Korean patients with T2DM without prior evidence of CAD were assessed (mean age 57.2 years). CAC imaging was performed using a 40-slice MDCT. Serum OPG levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Oscotec, Korea) from the serum samples of each subject. We measured the baPWV as an index of arterial stiffness. In addition, we measured fasting glucose, HbA(1)C, hsCRP and lipid profiles. A total of 74 patients (67.3%) had minimal or insignificant CAC (<10). The CACS, OPG and baPWV showed significant positive correlations with each other. The CACS was significantly associated with the baPWV, smoking and use of a statin. The baPWV was significantly associated with age, duration of DM, total cholesterol and CACS by multiple linear regression models of the dependent variables of CACS or baPWV. CAC and baPWV were significant predictors of each other (r = 0.359, P = 0.014 and r = 0.361, P = 0.004). The results of this study showed that CAC, baPWV and serum OPG levels were significantly correlated with each other in asymptomatic Korean patients with T2DM. Furthermore, our results suggest that arterial stiffness, as determined by baPWV, may predict the extent of coronary calcification by MDCT.", 
    "23": "Progression of colon cancer is associated with the up-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-R). Clinical and preclinical evidence shows that a combination of COX-2 and HMG-R inhibitors provide additive/synergistic chemopreventive effects against colorectal cancer. However, the mechanism by which statins and NSAIDs inhibit cancer growth is not yet fully understood. We aimed to identify critical molecules and signal pathways modulated by a combination of lovastatin and celecoxib in the human HCT-116 colon cancer cell line. HCT-116 cells were exposed to 50 microM celecoxib, 25 microM lovastatin or a combination of both to assess their effect in modulating caveolin-1 expression and its down-stream signaling pathways. Our results suggest that a combination of lovastatin and/or celecoxib suppressed caveolin-1 expression and membrane localization profoundly when compared to either agent alone. Lovastatin and/or celecoxib also inhibited caveolin-1-dependent cell survival signals mediated through Akt activation as well as its down-stream effectors such as phosphorylated ERK and STAT3 in HCT-116 cells. Treatment with lovastatin or celecoxib decreased the levels of cyclin D1, CDK2, pRb and E2F1, while the combination treatment showed more pronounced suppression. In addition, lovastatin and celecoxib also decreased the amount of cholesterol rich cytoplasmic lipid bodies (storehouses of esteridied arachidonates) by 80%, while the combination showed a complete inhibition. Overall, our data suggest that a combination of COX-2 and HMG-R inhibitors synergistically inhibits caveolin-1 and its associated signaling pathways.", 
    "24": "Pilot-scale libraries of eight-membered medium ring lactams (MRLs) and related tricyclic compounds (either seven-membered lactams, thiolactams or amines) were screened for their ability to inhibit the catalytic activity of human recombinant 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in vitro. A dozen of the synthetic compounds mimic the inhibition of purified HMG-CoA reductase activity caused by pravastatin, fluvastatin and sodium salts of lovastatin, mevastatin and simvastatin in this cell-free assay, suggesting direct interaction with the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. Moreover, several MRLs inhibit the metabolic activity of L1210 tumor cells in vitro to a greater degree than fluvastatin, lovastatin, mevastatin and simvastatin, whereas pravastatin is inactive. Although the correlation between the concentration-dependent inhibitions of HMG-CoA reductase activity over 10 min in the cell-free assay and L1210 tumor cell proliferation over 4 days in culture is unclear, some bioactive MRLs elicit interesting combinations of statin-like (IC50: 7.4-8.0 microM) and anti-tumor (IC50: 1.4-2.3 microM) activities. The HMG-CoA reductase-inhibiting activities of pravastatin and an MRL persist in the presence of increasing concentrations of NADPH. But increasing concentrations of HMG-CoA block the HMG-CoA reductase-inhibiting activity of pravastatin without altering that of an MRL, suggesting that MRLs and existing statins may have different mechanisms of enzyme interaction and inhibition. When tested together, suboptimal concentrations of synthetic MRLs and existing statins have additive inhibitory effects on HMG-CoA reductase activity. Preliminary molecular docking studies with MRL-based inhibitors indicate that these ligands fit sterically well into the HMG-CoA reductase statin-binding receptor model and, in contrast to mevastatin, may occupy a narrow channel housing the pyridinium moiety on NADP+.",

    "29": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin on the markers of oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The study population consisted of 151 patients with T2DM and 147 control individuals. The patients with T2DM were treated with 40 mg of simvastatin per day or 10 mg of simvastatin per day. Waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, and glucose and insulin values were obtained; and fasting serum lipids, malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity were determined before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Statin treatment significantly decreased plasma lipids in all patients with diabetes (P < 0.05). No significant differences were detected between the two treatment groups with respect to plasma lipid profile (P < 0.05). In addition, the effects of atorvastatin to increase nitric oxide concentration (33.28 +/- 3.37 micromol/L versus 27.32 +/- 4.15 micromol/L, P < 0.05) and glutathione peroxidase (17.67 +/- 1.41 micromol/L versus 14.28 +/- 1.65 micromol/L, P < 0.05), superoxide dismutase activity (34.28 +/- 4.71 micromol/L versus 27.91 +/- 3.38 micromol/L, P < 0.05 ) and decreased malondialdehyde level (49.52 +/- 5.67 micromol/L versus 42.08 +/- 5.16 micromol/L, P < 0.05) were significantly greater in patients with T2DM compared with simvastatin. The changes in the markers of oxidative stress did not correlate with the changes in plasma lipid profile (P > 0.05). This study suggested that atorvastatin reduced oxidative stress more effectively than simvastatin in patients with T2DM and the clinical benefits of statins may be independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects.", 
    "30": "Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a progressive disease characterized by inappropriate increase of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) leading to occlusion of pulmonary arterioles. Inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling is starting to garner attention as a targeted therapy for IPAH. We assessed the inhibitory effects of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutanyl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on PDGF-induced proliferation and migration of PASMCs obtained from 6 patients with IPAH who underwent lung transplantation. PDGF stimulation caused a significantly higher growth rate of PASMCs from patients with IPAH than that of normal control PASMCs as assessed by (3)H-thymidine incorporation. Simvastatin (0.1 micromol/L) significantly inhibited PDGF-induced cell proliferation of PASMCs from patients with IPAH but did not inhibit proliferation of normal control cells at the same concentration. Western blot analysis revealed that simvastatin significantly increased the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p27. PDGF significantly increased the migration distance of IPAH-PASMCs compared with that of normal PASMCs, and simvastatin (1 micromol/L) significantly inhibited PDGF-induced migration. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that simvastatin (1 micromol/L) inhibited translocation of Rho A from the cytoplasm to membrane and disorganized actin fibers in PASMCs from patients with IPAH. In conclusion, simvastatin had inhibitory effects on inappropriate PDGF signaling in PASMCs from patients with IPAH.", 
    "31": "Current clinical guidelines for management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) have evolved to reflect the findings of numerous randomized clinical trials and represent an important opportunity to effectively improve the cardiovascular (CV) risk profile of a wide range of patients. Implementation of guideline-recommended LDL-C management strategies facilitates the appropriate use of all available treatments, including lifestyle and dietary changes and pharmacotherapy. Where intensive lowering of LDL-C is required, suboptimal use of statins is a major contributor to the significant number of patients who remain at an unnecessarily increased risk of CV disease as a consequence of failing to reach their guideline-recommended LDL-C goals. This underuse may be explained by concerns over the safety and efficacy of high-dose statin regimens in certain populations. These issues are explored in the context of current, evidence-based clinical guidelines for LDL-C management and, through 3 hypothetical case studies, selection of appropriate starting doses of statins, and titration to a higher dose or switching to a more potent statin, to ensure that patients reach their individual LDL-C goals and reduce their overall CV risk, is also examined.", 
    "32": "The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel comparison study was to evaluate the lipid-lowering effect of orally administrated nattokinase and nattokinase combined with red yeast rice (RYR) extract on blood lipids in patients with hyperlipidemia. A total of 47 patients with hyperlipidemia were assigned to one of three groups: 1. nattokinase-mono formula (50 mg/capsule), 2. combined formula of nattokinase with RYR (300 mg of extract/capsule) and 3. placebo. Subjects received a twice daily dose of two capsules for six months. The mono formula showed no effects on blood lipids until month six, while the combined formula ameliorated all of measured lipids starting from month one. In the combined group significant decreases were found with regard to: triglycerides (TG) by 15%, total cholesterol (TC) by 25%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 41%, TC/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio by 29.5%, and increases in HDL-C by 7.5%. These changes were sustained until the end of study. After controlling for baseline levels, only the combined group, but not mono group, showed a significant difference (p<0.0001) in TC, LDL-C and TC/HDL-C ratio when compared with the placebo group. In summary, this study provides long-term efficacy of nattokinase supplementation and shows that the combined formula has relatively more potent effects than the mono formula on lowering of blood lipids, suggesting that combined nattokinase with RYR will be a better neutraceutical for patients with hyperlipidemia than nattokinase alone.",

Reduction of LDL-C in the pitavastatin 2 mg group was 39% compared with 35% in the simvastatin 20 mg group. Pitavastatin 4 mg showed similar effects on all lipid parameters to simvastatin 40 mg. The reductions in LDL-C were 44% and 43%, respectively. The safety profiles of pitavastatin and simvastatin were similar at the two dose levels.

The CORONA trial researched the effects of 10 mg rosuvastatin compared to placebo on the incidence of serious cardiovascular events in 5,011 patients with systolic heart failure of ischemic aetiology, above 60 years of age and in the NYHA functional class II-IV. Even though rosuvastatin reduced the mean LDL-cholesterol plasma concentrations by 45.0% (p < 0.001) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations by 37.1% (p < 0.001), the incidence of cardiovascular events was not importantly affected (HR = 0.92; p = 0.12). Rosuvastatin had no effect on overall mortality. The treatment resulted only in a reduction of the number of hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes (p < 0.001). The GISSI-HF trial involved 4,574 patients with chronic heart failure irrespective of aetiology and the ejection fraction value randomised to take either 10 mg of rosuvastatin or placebo. The results were almost identical. Rosuvastatin had no effect on the incidence of the primary end-point--the sum of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations (HR = 1.01; p = 0.903). The overall mortality was not affected either. Administration of rosuvastatin in both studies was safe, the number of adverse events, including myopathies and renal failure, was no different from placebo. However, recent results from the CORONA trial subtrials have suggested that important interactions exist in patients with chronic heart failure between the effects of rosuvastatin and natriuretic peptide and hsCRP plasma concentrations. Rosuvastatin provides clinical benefit in patients with relatively low concentrations of natriuretic peptides, i.e. relatively well-controlled, while it has no clinical effect in patients with high natriuretic peptide concentrations. Similarly, rosuvastatin provides clinical benefit in patients with high hsCRP but has no effect in patients with normal hsCRP (< 2 mg/l).",

A total of 72 cases of acute myocardial infarction patients were divided into a normocholesterol group (n = 37) and a hypercholesterol group (n = 35) according to their serum low-density lipoprotein. All patients were given oral simvastatin 40 mg/day for 6 months, and their pulse-wave velocity (PWV) of different artery segments and ankle-brachial index (ABI) were measured before and after the therapy. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in both groups decreased significantly (2.13 +/- 0.32 vs 1.56 +/- 0.28, 3.43 +/- 0.80 vs 2.28 +/- 0.47 mmol/l, P < 0.01).

There was a strong correlation across all groups between macrophage density and standardized uptake value (SUV) derived from ex vivo microPET (r = 0.95, P < 0.001) and well counting (r = 0.96, P < 0.001). Ex vivo FDG SUV was significantly different between the three groups (P < 0.001). However, the correlation between in vivo microPET FDG SUV and macrophage density was insignificant (r = 0.16, P = 0.57) with no statistical differences in FDG SUV seen between the three groups. This study confirms that in an animal model of inflamed and non-inflamed atherosclerosis, significant differences in FDG SUV allow differentiation of highly inflamed atherosclerotic aortas from those stabilized by statin therapy and low cholesterol diet and controls.",

All patients require some level of preoperative screening to identify and minimize immediate and future risk, with a careful focus on known coronary artery disease or risks for coronary artery disease and functional capacity. The 2007 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines are clear that noninvasive and invasive testing should be limited to circumstances in which results will clearly affect patient management or in which testing would otherwise be indicated. beta-Blocker therapy has become controversial in light of recent publications but should be continued in patients already on therapy, and started in patients with high cardiac risk undergoing intermediate- or high-risk surgery.", 
    "50": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the principal cause of dementia in older people, and accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is a crucial event in AD pathogenesis. Despite opposite results found in literature, increased evidence posits that high cholesterol levels enhance the risk to develop AD. In fact, cholesterol metabolism and catabolism are affected in this neurodegenerative disorder. Since amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and subsequent Abeta production are dependent on membrane cholesterol content and on levels of isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, changes in cholesterol might have different consequences on Abeta formation. These pieces of evidence support that inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, like statins, could have a therapeutic role in AD. Many studies about the effect of statins use in AD show conflicting results; however, some authors explain it by the differences in administrated doses. Recent studies demonstrate that statins can efficiently decrease Abeta formation from APP and be neuroprotective against the peptide toxicity. Because of the high number of pleiotropic effects of statins, novel molecular mechanisms that account for the beneficial effect of these drugs on AD might be discovered in a near future.",

The success of clinical trials in Japan is essential to build original evidence specific for Japanese patients. Based on this concept, we have performed several large-scale clinical trials to provide EBM, including the Japanese Antiplatelets Myocardial Infarction Study [JAMIS; clinical improvement in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with antiplatelet therapy], the Japanese beta-Blockers and Calcium Antagonists Myocardial Infarction (JBCMI; comparison of the effects of beta-blockers and calcium antagonists on cardiovascular events in post-AMI patients), a multicenter study for aggressive lipid-lowering strategy by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in patients with AMI (MUSASHI; effects of statin therapy on cardiovascular events in patients with AMI), and the Japanese Primary Prevention of Atherosclerosis with Aspirin for Diabetes (JPAD trial; efficacy of low-dose aspirin therapy for primary prevention of atherosclerotic events in type 2 diabetic patients). The results of these prospective studies were directly linked with clinical practice. We have acquired the know-how of large-scale clinical trials; an important point is to have passion for \"buildup evidence specific for the Japanese\" and to recruit subjects for enrollment after explaining the significance of \"clinical trials for the Japanese\".", 
    "61": "A simple and sensitive method for simultaneous analysis of 43 pharmaceutical compounds in sewage sludge and sediment samples was developed and validated. The target compounds were extracted using pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) and then purified and pre-concentrated by solid phase extraction (SPE) using a hydrophilic-lipophilic balanced polymer. PLE extraction was performed on temperature of 100 degrees C, with methanol/water mixture (1/2, v/v) as extraction solvent. The quantitative analysis was performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using a hybrid triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LC-QqLIT-MS). Data acquisition was carried out in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode, monitoring two SRM transitions to ensure an accurate identification of target compounds in the samples. Additional identification and confirmation of target compounds were performed using the Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) function. The method was validated through the estimation of the linearity, sensitivity, repeatability, reproducibility and matrix effects. The internal standard approach was used for quantification because it efficiently corrected matrix effects. Despite the strong matrix interferences, the recoveries were generally higher of 50% in both matrixes and the detection and quantification limits were very low. Beside the very good sensitivity provided by LC-QqLIT-MS, an important characteristic of the method is that all the target compounds can be simultaneously extracted, treated and analysed. Hence, it can be used for routine analysis of pharmaceuticals providing large amount of data. The method was applied for the analysis of pharmaceuticals in river sediment and wastewater sludge from three treatment plants with different treatment properties (i.e. capacity, secondary treatment, quality of influent waters). The analysis showed a widespread occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the sludge matrices.", 
    "62": "For the first time, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed and validated for the determination of fluvastatin (FLV) in plasma samples at picogram level. The assay employed a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes FLV with high affinity, and FLV conjugate of bovine serum albumin (FLV-BSA) immobilized onto microplate wells as a solid-phase. The assay involved a competitive binding reaction between FLV, in plasma sample, and the immobilized FLV-BSA for the binding sites on a limited amount of the anti-FLV antibody. The bound anti-FLV antibody was quantified with horseradish peroxidase-labeled second anti-rabbit IgG antibody (HRP-IgG) and 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate for the peroxidase enzyme. The concentration of FLV in the sample was quantified by its ability to inhibit the binding of the anti-FLV antibody to the immobilized FLV-BSA and subsequently the color intensity in the assay wells. The conditions for the proposed ELISA were investigated and the optimum conditions were employed in the determination of FLV in plasma samples. The assay limit of detection was 10 pg mL(-1) and the effective working range at relative standard deviations (RSD) of <or=5% was 20-1000 pg mL(-1). Analytical recovery of FLV from spiked plasma was 97.1-102.7+/-2.85-6.25%. The precision of the assay was satisfactory; RSD was 2.46-5.37 and 3.19-6.64% for the intra- and inter-assay precision, respectively. The analytical procedure is convenient, and one can analyze approximately 200 samples per working day, facilitating the processing of large-number batch of samples. The proposed ELISA has a great value in routine analysis of FLV for its therapeutic monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies.", 
    "63": "Nephrotoxicity due to renal proximal tubule accumulation of aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics, such as gentamicin, represents a major clinical problem. Receptor-mediated endocytosis via the multi-ligand receptor megalin is thought to be a key mechanism in the cellular uptake of AGs and nephrotoxicity. This process can be modulated by the intracellular concentration of isoprenoid pyrophosphates derived from the processing of mevalonate by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Post-translation modifications by isoprenoid pyrophosphates are necessary for GTP-binding protein function. Given that statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and therefore affect the concentration of isoprenoid pyrophosphates, we have tested the hypothesis that statins will lead to a reduction in AG renal proximal tubule accumulation and cytotoxicity. Gentamicin accumulated within cultured proximal tubule derived opossum kidney (OK) cells and led to dose- and time-dependent cell death which was inhibited by non-toxic doses of simvastatin (IC(50) 1.3 microM), rosuvastatin (IC(50) 16.3 microM) and pravastatin (IC(50) 38.8 microM). The mechanism of inhibition was linked to the degree of cholesterol synthesis inhibition and GTP-binding protein unprenylation. Moreover, co-incubation with mevalonate or geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate, products of HMG-CoA reductase, reversed the inhibitory effect of statins on cellular accumulation and cytotoxicity of gentamicin. In summary, our data suggest that the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by statins may provide a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent AG-induced nephrotoxicity.",

In patients with inflammation (CRP level > 5 mg/L), the adjusted relative risk of combined vascular events was 29% greater compared with those without inflammation and a low LDL cholesterol level (LDL cholesterol < or = 123 mg/dL).

It is estimated that there are currently 33.5 million U.S. patients on chronic statin treatment regimens. Recently, statins have been shown to have pleiotropic including anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. In this study, we assessed the pharmacological effects of simvastatin administered alone and in combination with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on measures of ischemia and hemorrhage in large clot embolized New Zealand white rabbits. For these studies, simvastatin (20 mg/kg, SC in DMSO) was administered 24 and 4 h prior to large clot embolization in order to achieve a \"loading dose\" pretreatment with the drug. In combination studies, tPA (3.3 mg/kg, IV) was administered 1 h following embolization. Intravenous tPA administration significantly increased hemorrhage volume by 175% (p=0.015) and hemorrhage incidence by 60% (p>0.05) compared to control, but did not affect infarct incidence or volume. Simvastatin treatment significantly decreased tPA-induced hemorrhage incidence (p=0.022) and volume (p=0.0001) following embolization. The study suggests that simvastatin treatment blocks or attenuates mechanisms involved in tPA-induced hemorrhage. Based upon our results, patients on simvastatin treatment may have significantly reduced tPA-induced side effects should they require tPA administration following an embolic stroke.",

Noninvasive testing was infrequent and medical costs were low among subjects with low CAC scores, both rising progressively with increasing CAC scores (p<0.001), particularly in the 31 (2.2% of subjects) that had CAC scores>or=1,000. Similarly, invasive coronary angiography rose progressively with increasing scores (p<0.001) but occurred exclusively among subjects first undergoing noninvasive testing and overall, was performed in only 19.4% of subjects with CAC scores>or=1,000.",

    "105": "PON-1 is a potential therapeutic target to further reduce cardiovascular risk because it is a detoxifying esterase with antioxidant properties. The PON-1 knockout models result in higher susceptibility to atherosclerosis, and PON activity contributes to cardiovascular risk in humans. Human gene variants determine PON activity; however, the impact of these variants on recurrent cardiovascular events in vascular disease is as of yet unknown.", 
    "106": "We conducted a 10-year follow-up study of 793 CAD patients in the REGRESS (REgression GRowth Evaluation Statin Study) trial cohort, using nationwide registries. Genotypes were obtained of 2 PON-1 isotypes (L55M, rs854560, and Q192R, rs662), which were previously associated with PON activity. Absolute and relative risks by genotype were estimated using Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazards analyses.",

Hazard ratios per allele copy were 1.71 (95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 2.8, p=0.03) for the glutamine isotype at codon 192 and 1.56 (95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 2.3, p=0.03) for methionine at codon 55. Both isotypes had previously been related to lower PON activity. No effect was observed on all-cause mortality.",

These long-term findings confirm functional data on PON-1 activity, emphasize the relevance of this pathway in vascular disease, and enforce its putative role as a target to modify and estimate cardiovascular risk.", 
    "109": "Men and women with lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers than those without PAD. Observational studies link higher levels of several inflammatory biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and soluble adhesion molecules, to 1 or more of the following outcomes in people with PAD: more severe PAD, greater lower extremity functional impairment, more adverse calf skeletal muscle characteristics, greater declines in the ankle brachial index, greater declines in lower extremity performance, and higher rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers are also associated with poorer outcomes after lower extremity revascularization, including graft restenosis and mortality. Increasing levels of CRP are associated with increased mortality and faster functional decline among people with PAD. Statin therapies reduce cardiovascular event rates and may improve walking performance in men and women with PAD, perhaps in part because statins can reduce inflammation. However, no clinical trials have been performed to establish whether therapies that specifically block or lower inflammatory biomarkers improve outcomes in patients with PAD. Family studies show that heritability of PAD ranges from approximately 20% to 45% after adjusting for atherosclerotic risk factors. A genetic marker for PAD has the potential to identify individuals at increased risk for PAD and may also uncover proteins that can help determine mechanisms of development of lower extremity atherosclerosis. However, a genetic marker for PAD has not been identified.",

Analysis of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed a decreased ubiquinone status (77 and 132; reference range: 140-580 pmol/mg) and cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) activity (0.006 and 0.007 reference range: 0.014-0.034). To assess statin treatment in the absence of possible pharmacological interference from cyclosporin or itraconazole, primary astrocytes were cultured with lovastatin (100 microM). Lovastatin treatment resulted in a decrease in ubiquinone (97.9 +/- 14.9; control: 202.9 +/- 18.4 pmol/mg; p < 0.05), and complex IV activity (0.008 +/- 0.001; control: 0.011 +/- 0.001; p < 0.05) relative to control.

In high dose group, the quantity of liver microsome protein and the activity of CYP3A were both increased significantly (P < 0.05), and the metabolism of simvastatin also accelerate obviously (P < 0.05). But in the low dose group significant distinction of every index was not found.",

Since treatment with statins or gamma-tocotrienol alone induced a dose-responsive inhibition, whereas combined treatment with subeffective doses of these agents resulted in a synergistic inhibition in +SA mammary tumor cell growth, studies were conducted to investigate the role of the HMGR pathway in mediating the antiproliferative effects of combined low dose statin and gamma-tocotrienol. Treatment with 8 microM simvastatin inhibited cell growth and isoprenylation of Rap1A and Rab6, and supplementation with 2 microM mevalonate reversed these effects. However, the growth inhibitory effects of 4 microM gamma-tocotrienol were not dependent upon suppression in mevalonate synthesis. Treatment with subeffective doses of simvastatin (0.25 microM), lovastatin (0.25 microM), mevastatin (0.25 microM), pravastatin (10 microM), or gamma-tocotrienol (2 muM) alone had no effect on protein prenylation or mitogenic signaling, whereas combined treatment with these agents resulted in a significant inhibition in +SA cell growth, and a corresponding decrease in total HMGR, Rap1A and Rab6 prenylation, and MAPK signaling, and mevalonate supplementation reversed these effects. These findings demonstrate that the synergistic antiproliferative effects of combined low dose statin and gamma-tocotrienol treatment are directly related to an inhibition in HMGR activity and subsequent suppression in mevalonate synthesis.", 
    "116": "Randomized trials provide high-quality evidence for patient care. The Der Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie (4D), a randomized study which demonstrated no benefit of statins among diabetic patients receiving hemodialysis, was published in July 2005. To determine effects of this study we conducted a retrospective, population-based, time series analysis with change-point regression to see if the rate of statin prescription to dialysis patients had been modified. We linked health administrative data for all diabetic hemodialysis patients living in Ontario, Canada, with similar characteristics to the 4D patient cohort. During the nearly 11-year period prior to study publication, the rate of statin use increased almost 14-fold, from 43 to 597 per 1000 patients. For 2.5 years after study publication, rather than diminish, statin use continued to rise to an absolute rate of 676 per 1000 patients. These temporal patterns in statin use closely mimicked trends in the diabetic population not receiving dialysis. The 4D trial had no impact on statin use when we restricted the analysis to incident statin prescriptions or expanded the characteristics of the dialysis patients considered for study. Thus, we found that publication of a large, expensive, randomized controlled trial in patients receiving hemodialysis had no immediate impact on clinical practice. The use of a common cardiovascular medication in this patient population appears to be influenced by other factors.",

Treatment with simvastatin (20 mg/d) or fenofibrate (267 mg/d) was initiated in all DM patients due to fasting hyperlipemia, and in the AH group. Blood samples were drawn in the fasting state and 3 h after a meal at three time points, i.e. at baseline, after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. Triglycerides (TG), glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL2-C, and HDL3-C were assayed by routine laboratory tests; apolipoproteins A and B by immunoturbidimetry, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) by immunonephelometry.",

There were no linear correlations between the levels of TG (or HDL cholesterol) and HDL3-C, or between TG and hsCRP in the DM group. Hypolipemic treatment decreased fasting lipid and hsCRP levels, significantly reduced postprandial lipemia (p <0.001) and restored some correlations between lipid variables observed in the control group, but not those with hsCRP.",

A total of 636 blood samples from 57 healthy male volunteers were used. The PPK analysis was carried out using nonlinear mixed effect modeling (NONMEM) and validated by a bootstrap analysis. The PK profile of pravastatin was best described by a model of EHC with Erlang's distribution. A covariate analysis revealed that SLCO1B1(*)15 significantly influenced relative bioavailability (F(rel)); F(rel) was increased 1.50- and 1.95-fold in participants heterozygous and homozygous, respectively, for the (*)15 allele in comparison with participants without the allele. No ABCC2 polymorphism was identified as a potential covariate for pravastatin. The bootstrap analysis indicated that the PK profile of pravastatin was adequately described by the proposed PPK model. SLCO1B1(*)15 has a significant effect on F(rel), indicating that OATP1B1 is one of the determinants of systemic exposure to pravastatin.", 
    "123": "The preparation of a new series of 2-aryloxy-3-phenyl-propanoic acids, resulting from the introduction of a linker into the diphenyl system of the previously reported PPARalpha/gamma dual agonist 1, allowed the identification of new ligands with improved potency on PPARalpha and unchanged activity on PPARgamma. For the most interesting stereoisomers S-2 and S-4, X-ray studies in PPARgamma and docking experiments in PPARalpha provided a molecular explanation for their different behavior as full and partial agonists of PPARalpha and PPARgamma, respectively. Due to the adverse effects provoked by hypolipidemic drugs on skeletal muscle function, we also investigated the blocking activity of S-2 and S-4 on skeletal muscle membrane chloride channel conductance and found that these ligands have a pharmacological profile more beneficial compared to fibrates currently used in therapy.",

Atorvastatin (5 or 10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) or saline was administered by daily oral gavage from the day of induction of viral myocarditis to the day of sacrifice. Fourteen days after injection of CVB3, animals were sacrificed. Alterations in myocardial Cxs expression were examined by RT-PCR, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry. Plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were measured by ELISA.", 
    "126": "Fourteen days after inoculation with CVB3, myocardial expression of Cx43 and Cx45 was significantly downregulated. Treatment with atorvastatin not only reduced the overproduction of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, but also enhanced the expression of Cx43 and Cx45, therefore attenuating myocardial injury and improving the survival rate of viral myocarditis.",

In contrast, an approach that treats all high-risk individuals with a polypill containing statin, three half-dose antihypertensives and aspirin, with a 20-80% uptake, would save 1861-7452 lives per million.

    "143": "The hepatobiliary transport and local disposition of rosuvastatin in pig were investigated, along with the impact of concomitant dosing with two known multiple transport inhibitors; cyclosporine and gemfibrozil. Rosuvastatin (80 mg) was administered as an intrajejunal bolus dose in treatments I, II, and III (TI, TII, and TIII, respectively; n = 6 per treatment). Cyclosporine (300 mg) and gemfibrozil (600 mg) were administered in addition to the rosuvastatin dose in TII and TIII, respectively. Cyclosporine was administered as a 2-h intravenous infusion and gemfibrozil as an intrajejunal bolus dose. In treatment IV (TIV, n = 4) 5.9 mg of rosuvastatin was administered as an intravenous bolus dose. The study was conducted using a pig model, which enabled plasma sampling from the portal (VP), hepatic (VH), and femoral veins and bile from the common hepatic duct. The biliary recoveries of the administered rosuvastatin dose were 9.0 +/- 3.5 and 35.7 +/- 15.6% in TI and TIV, respectively. Rosuvastatin was highly transported into bile as shown by the median AUC(bile)/AUC(VH) ratio in TI of 1770 (1640-11,300). Gemfibrozil did not have an effect on the plasma pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, most likely because the unbound inhibitor concentrations did not exceed the reported IC(50) values. However, cyclosporine significantly reduced the hepatic extraction of rosuvastatin (TI, 0.89 +/- 0.06; TII, 0.46 +/- 0.13) and increased the AUC(VP) and AUC(VH) by 1.6- and 9.1-fold, respectively. In addition, the biliary exposure and f(e, bile) were reduced by approximately 50%. The strong effect of cyclosporine was in accordance with inhibition of sinusoidal uptake transporters, such as members of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide family, rather than canalicular transporters.", 
    "144": "While conventional pharmacogenetic studies have considered single gene effects, we tested if a genetic score of nine LDL- and HDL-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, previously shown to predict cardiovascular disease, is related to fluvastatin-induced lipid change. In patients with asymptomatic plaque in the right carotid artery, thus candidates for statin therapy, we related score LDL [APOB(rs693), APOE(rs4420638), HMGCR(rs12654264), LDLR(rs1529729), and PCSK9(rs11591147)] and score HDL [ABCA1(rs3890182), CETP(rs1800775), LIPC(rs1800588), and LPL(rs328)] as well as the combined score LDL+HDL to fluvastatin-induced LDL reduction (+/- metoprolol) (n = 395) and HDL increase (n = 187) following 1 year of fluvastatin treatment. In women, an increasing number of unfavorable alleles (i.e., alleles conferring higher LDL and lower HDL) of score LDL+HDL (P = 0.037) and of score LDL (P = 0.023) was associated with less pronounced fluvastatin-induced LDL reduction. Furthermore, in women, both score LDL+HDL (P = 0.001) and score HDL (P = 0.022) were directly correlated with more pronounced fluvastatin-induced HDL increase, explaining 5.9-11.6% of the variance in treatment response in women. There were no such associations in men. This suggests that a gene score based on variation in nine different LDL- and HDL-associated genes is of importance for the magnitude of fluvastatin HDL increase in women with asymptomatic plaque in the carotid artery.",

Over the last decade, both preclinical and clinical research has provided multiple lines of unequivocal evidence that inflammation and immune response are integral components of the pathogenesis for atherosclerosis. In this article, both clinical and preclinical evidence in support of atherosclerosis as an inflammatory disease will be reviewed.

We examined the association between switching from atorvastatin to simvastatin and changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in clinical practice. We compared atorvastatin-treated patients at high cardiovascular risk who switched to simvastatin between June 2006 and July 2007 with randomly selected matched patients who remained on atorvastatin and evaluated changes in LDL-C and percentage of patients reaching LDL-C less than 100 mg/dL. Of patients who switched from atorvastatin to simvastatin, the majority were excluded as a result of lack of LDL-C measurements, leaving 383 patients in the analysis. Among these, 122 (31.9%) switched to a simvastatin dose that was less than therapeutically equivalent to their prior atorvastatin dose. Compared with control subjects, switched patients were less likely to reach an LDL-C less than 100 mg/dL (68.4% versus 74.0%; odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.99; P = 0.041) and had higher measured LDL-C (91.4 versus 87.2 mg/dL; P = 0.009).

Although bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory medications are effective medicines in some asthmatic patients, it is clear that an unmet therapeutic need persists for a subpopulation of individuals with severe asthma. This chronic lung disease is characterized by airflow limitation, lung inflammation, and remodeling that includes increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass. In addition to its contractile properties, the ASM also contributes to the inflammatory process by producing active mediators, which modify the extracellular matrix composition and interact with inflammatory cells. These undesirable functions make interventions aimed at reducing ASM abundance an attractive strategy for novel asthma therapies. The following three mechanisms could limit the accumulation of smooth muscle: decreased cell proliferation, augmented cell apoptosis, and reduced cell migration into the smooth muscle layer. Inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway or statins hold promise for asthma treatment, because they exhibit anti-inflammatory, antimigratory, and antiproliferative effects in preclinical and clinical studies, and they can target the smooth muscle. This review will discuss current knowledge of ASM biology and identify gaps in the field to stimulate future investigations of the cellular mechanisms that control ASM overabundance in asthma.

    "219": "Dolichols (Dol) are polyprenol lipids that are essential structural components of eukaryotic membranes. In addition, the phosphorylated derivatives of Dol function as lipid anchors of mono- and oligosaccharide precursors involved in protein glycosylation. The biological importance of Dol phosphates (Dol-P) is illustrated by the severe outcome of human disorders linked to Dol biosynthetic defects, such as Dol-kinase deficiency. For characterization of inherited human diseases and evaluation of therapeutic trials, cultured cells often serve as a sole possible source for experimentation. Limited amounts of cell culture material render the quantitative analysis of Dol a challenging task. Here, we present HPLC- and mass spectrometry-based approaches to analyze and quantitate Dol-P from cultured human cells. The composition of naturally occurring Dol-P and the saturation state of the alpha-isoprene units was identified by negative-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Furthermore, fluorescently labeled Dol-P were separated by HPLC and quantified by comparison to known amounts of the internal standard polyprenol-P. The effect of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitor, on the formation of Dol-P in HeLa cells was investigated. As expected, this treatment led to a decrease of Dol-P down to 35% of normal levels.",

Statins are associated with decreased stroke risk and may improve stability of atherosclerotic plaques. The present study investigated the effect of simvastatin on expression of Lp-PLA(2) levels in atherosclerotic plaques and on Lp-PLA(2) activity in atherosclerotic aortas. Rabbits were a fed chow (control group) or a high-cholesterol diet (atherosclerosis group) for 12 weeks. An additional group on the high-cholesterol diet received simvastatin (5 mg/kg per day) for the last 4 weeks (simvastatin group). Lp-PLA(2) activity in plasma and atherosclerotic aortas was significantly higher in the atherosclerosis group than in the control group and, consistent with this, abundant Lp-PLA(2) protein was detected in plaques in the atherosclerosis group. Simvastatin significantly reduced Lp-PLA(2) activity in plasma and aorta tissue, and reduced Lp-PLA(2) protein level in atherosclerotic plaques. Whereas there was no significant difference in total atherosclerotic lesion area between simvastatin and atherosclerosis groups, simvastatin significantly reduced macrophage content, lipid retention and the intima/media ratio but increased the content of smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, statin treatment markedly reduced Lp-PLA(2) in both plasma and atherosclerotic plaques. This was associated with attenuation of the local inflammatory response and improved plaque stability.", 
    "221": "Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 is responsible for the oxidative metabolism of many clinically available drugs from a diverse number of drug classes (e.g., thiazolidinediones, meglitinides, NSAIDs, antimalarials and chemotherapeutic taxanes). The CYP2C8 enzyme is encoded by the CYP2C8 gene, and several common nonsynonymous polymorphisms (e.g., CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3) exist in this gene. The CYP2C8*2 and *3 alleles have been associated in vitro with decreased metabolism of paclitaxel and arachidonic acid. Recently, the influence of CYP2C8 polymorphisms on substrate disposition in humans has been investigated in a number of clinical pharmacogenetic studies. Contrary to in vitro data, clinical data suggest that the CYP2C8*3 allele is associated with increased metabolism of the CYP2C8 substrates, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone and repaglinide. However, the CYP2C8*3 allele has not been associated with paclitaxel pharmacokinetics in most clinical studies. Furthermore, clinical data regarding the impact of the CYP2C8*3 allele on the disposition of NSAIDs are conflicting and no definitive conclusions can be made at this time. The purpose of this review is to highlight these clinical studies that have investigated the association between CYP2C8 polymorphisms and CYP2C8 substrate pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics in humans. In this review, CYP2C8 clinical pharmacogenetic data are provided by drug class, followed by a discussion of the future of CYP2C8 clinical pharmacogenetic research.",

    "223": "87 patients were included in the present study. The patients diagnosed with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and dislypidemia were treated for 4 months with lovastatin 10 mg/day and those without dislypidemia with pentoxyphyllin, 400 mg x 3/day. The patients were evaluated clinically and biochemically monthly.", 
    "224": "Regarding the lovastatin-treated group, transaminases significantly decreased (p < 0.05), after the first and second month, as well as cholesterolemia (p < 0.001), and the APRI score after 2 months (p = 0.03). In the pentoxyphyllin-treated group, transaminases significantly decreased after 1 month (p < 0.05), and the Forns index after 2 months (p < 0.05).", 
    "225": "Both drugs significantly decreased the transaminases. Lovastatin reduced the cholesterolemia in the dislipidemic patients. The decrease of the APRI score suggests that both medicines have benefic effects on the hepatic histology, too.", 
    "226": "The exchange of lipids with cells and other lipoproteins is a crucial process in HDL metabolism and for HDL antiatherogenic function. Here, we tested a practical method to quantify the simultaneous transfer to HDL of phospholipids, free-cholesterol, esterified cholesterol and triacylglycerols and to verify the lipid transfer in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or undergoing statin treatment. Twenty-eight control subjects without CAD, 27 with CAD and 25 CAD patients under simvastatin treatment were studied. Plasma samples were incubated with a donor nanoemulsion prepared by ultrasonication of the constituent lipids and labeled with radioactive lipids; % lipids transferred to HDL were quantified in the HDL-containing supernatant after chemical precipitation of non-HDL fractions and the nanoemulsion. The assay was precise and reproducible. Increase of temperature (4-37 degrees C), of incubation period (5 min to 2 h), of HDL-cholesterol concentration (33-244 mg/dL) and of mass of nanoemulsion lipids (0.075-0.3 mg/microL) resulted in increased lipid transfer from the nanoemulsion to HDL. In contrast, increasing pH (6.5-8.5) and albumin concentration (3.5-7.0 g/dL) did not affect lipid transfer. There was no difference between CAD and control non-CAD with regard to the lipid transfer, but statin treatment reduced the transfer to HDL of all four lipids. The test herein described is a valid and practical tool for exploring an important aspect of HDL metabolism.", 
    "227": "Lovastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. Its inhibitory action on HMG-CoA reductase leads to depletion of isoprenoids, which inhibits post-translational modification of RAS. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining lovastatin with gefitinib on gefitinib-resistant human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with K-Ras mutations. Antitumor effects were measured by growth inhibition and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Effects on apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation, and immunoblots. Protein levels of RAS, AKT/pAKT, and RAF/ERK1/2 in cancer cells were analyzed by immunoblot. Compared with gefitinib alone, a combination of gefitinib with lovastatin showed significantly enhanced cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity in gefitinib-resistant A549 and NCI-H460 human NSCLC cells. In addition, lovastatin combination treatment significantly increased gefitinib-related apoptosis, as determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. These effects correlated with up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2. The combination of lovastatin and gefitinib effectively down-regulated RAS protein and suppressed the phosphorylation of RAF, ERK1/2, AKT, and EGFR in both cell lines. Taken together, these results suggest lovastatin can overcome gefitinib resistance, in NSCLC cells with K-Ras mutations, by down regulation of RAS protein, which leads to inhibition of both RAF/ERK and AKT pathways.",

    "237": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are widely prescribed for their cholesterol-lowering properties to reduce atherogenesis and cardiovascular morbidity. However, compelling evidence exists that statins also have extensive immunomodulatory properties that operate independently of lipid lowering. Consequently, much attention has been directed toward their immunomodulatory effect and their potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Statins have the ability to modulate a broad range of proinflammatory immune mechanisms through inhibition of small GTPases and other prenylated proteins. One of the statins' immunomodulatory effects is downregulation of MHC class II expression. In contrast, patients with statin-induced myopathy show high MHC class I expression. In this review, the effect of statins on MHC class I expression is reviewed alongside statins' effect on immune function.", 
    "238": "Fluvastatin has been shown to revert proinflammatory/prothrombotic effects of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in vitro and in mice. Here, we examined whether fluvastatin affects the levels of proinflammatory/prothrombotic markers in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble tissue factor (sTF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), sE-selectin (E-sel), C-reactive protein (CRP), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1), were measured in the sera of 93 APS patients and 60 controls and in the sera of nine patients with APS before and after 30 days of treatment with fluvastatin. Elevated levels of VEGF, sTF, and TNF-alpha were found in APS patients. Fluvastatin significantly reduced those markers in the majority of treated subjects. The data from this study show that statins may be beneficial in aPL-positive patients and warrant larger clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of the drug for the treatment of APS clinical manifestations."
