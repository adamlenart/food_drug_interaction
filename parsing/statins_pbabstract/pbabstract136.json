Among the several 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) available in the United States, only atorvastatin is associated with tinnitus, but none are associated with any forms of hearing loss. A search of the published literature (1950-August 2011) revealed no published case reports of ototoxicity associated with statins. To our knowledge, we describe the first case of progressive, irreversible hearing loss in a 32-year-old man 18\u00a0months after starting atorvastatin therapy. He began taking atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg every evening for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Six months later, he complained of occasional episodes of tinnitus, which resolved spontaneously. An audiogram was obtained and was normal. By 18\u00a0months, the tinnitus became continuous. Another audiogram revealed bilateral \"cookie-bite\" middle-frequency hearing loss. Atorvastatin was immediately discontinued, and the patient was fitted with hearing aids. Four years after drug discontinuation, his hearing loss had neither progressed nor regressed. Use of the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a possible (score of 2) temporal and causal relationship between the patient's hearing loss and atorvastatin. Causes of \"cookie-bite\" hearing loss include chronic exposure to loud noises, presbycusis, genetic predisposition, and drugs. The manufacturer of atorvastatin has received three unpublished cases of deafness, but claims that causal relationships were not established. Despite these claims by the manufacturer, based on this case report, we recommend that clinicians and patients be aware of the risk of atorvastatin-associated tinnitus and permanent hearing loss. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanism and frequency of this adverse event.", 
    "1": "The cerebrovascular remodeling is a prominent feature of hypertension and considered as a major risk of stroke. Statins may suppress the activation of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway and have pleiotropic actions against the development of vascular remodeling. We hypothesized that the inhibition of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway by simvastatin during hypertension could recuperate the pathological changes of basilar artery through the downregulation of cell proliferation. To resolve the problem, we used 2-kid, 2-clip rat as a hypertension model and evaluated the effect of simvastatin on the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway. In addition, we assessed the changes of the proliferation rate by CCK-8 assay in basilar artery smooth muscle cells. Our results from this study showed that a continuous increase in the plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1) concentration and the Rho/Rho-kinase activity was positively correlated with changes in blood pressure in the hypertensive rat. Simvastatin ameliorated the upregulated Rho/Rho-kinase activity and cell proliferation during hypertension. Moreover, simvastatin, the RhoA inhibitor C3, and the RhoA-kinase inhibitor Y27632 all attenuated the proliferation rate induced by ET-1 in basilar artery smooth muscle cells via the Rho/Rho-kinase signaling pathway. In conclusion, simvastatin attenuated ET-1-induced proliferation through the Rho/Rho-kinase signaling pathway in hypertensive rat basilar artery, and it may be an excellent reagent to protect vascular remodeling and stroke.", 
    "2": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is caused by a genetic deficiency in 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) reductase (EC 1.3.1.21), the last enzyme of the cholesterol synthetic pathway. In SLOS, plasma cholesterol concentration is reduced and immediate precursor concentration (7-DHC) is elevated. Surprisingly, total sterol synthesis is reduced but HMG-CoA reductase activity, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis is unaltered as judged by normal urinary excretion of mevalonic acid (MVA) (Pappu et al. J Lipid Res 43:1661-1669, 2002). These findings raise the possibility of increased diversion of MVA into the MVA shunt pathway away from sterol synthesis, by activation of the shunt pathway enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we measured the urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid (U-3MGC), a by-product of the shunt pathway, in 19 mildly to moderately severely affected SLOS subjects (ten males, nine females) receiving either a cholesterol-free or a high cholesterol diet, and in 20 age- and sex-matched controls. U-3MGC was similar in SLOS and controls, and was unaffected by dietary cholesterol intake. Further, no change in U-3MGC was observed in a subset of SLOS subjects (n = 9) receiving simvastatin. In contrast, U-MVA was reduced by cholesterol supplementation (~54%, p < 0.05) and by simvastatin (~50%, p < 0.04). There was no correlation between U-3MGC and either plasma sterol concentrations, urinary isoprenoids, or the subjects' clinical severity score. However U-3MGC was inversely correlated with age (p < 0.04) and body weight (p < 0.02), and higher in females than in males (~65%, p < 0.025). The data show that DHCR7 deficiency does not result in 3MGC accumulation in SLOS and suggest that the MVA shunt pathway is not activated in patients with the condition.", 
    "3": "Highly soluble amorphous calcium phosphate powder (ACP) was added to the alginate gel as a buffering agent, in an attempt to enable widely controlled release while avoiding an acidification of the gel-environment. Therapeutic effects of the ACP-containing alginate gel which slowly releases a drug, simvastatin, on osteoporosis model rats were examined. A model drug, simvastatin, incorporated in the alginate gel with ACP up to 0.5%, was continuously released for a long time under the acidic condition. The release rate was controlled by the amount of ACP, serving as a buffer to suppress acidity. When the alginate solution intramuscularly injected in the rat, a soft gel was formed in the injected site. Simvastatin released from the gel containing 0.5% of ACP showed high therapeutic effect on osteoporosis rat. Thus, the present injectable long-sustained release system is expected to be a novel drug delivery controlling device.", 
    "4": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor medications, commonly referred to as statins, are among the most widely prescribed medications. Variation in individual response to statins concerning low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction, clinical event benefit, and side effects has been observed. Some of this variability is attributed to demographic and environmental issues, chief of which is compliance. A large portion of the individual response to statin therapy is attributed to single nucleotide polymorphisms that have recently been elucidated, several of which seem to have clinical utility.", 
    "5": "In the modern era of statin therapy, major advances have been made in treating coronary heart disease. However, despite intensive treatment with statin therapy, residual cardiovascular risk persists and has been attributed to the persistence of atherogenic dyslipidemia and, in part, elevated triglycerides (TGs). In this review, the authors focus on the mechanism of elevated TGs and provide a discussion of the challenges of measuring TGs as a biomarker, its role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic heart disease, and results of several recent studies that have elucidated the relationship between TGs and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the focus of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines. LDL-C ranges from 50 to 70 mg/dL in native hunter-gatherers, healthy human neonates, free-living primates, and other wild mammals, who are notably free of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Multiple statin trials and meta-analyses support a treatment target of LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL, as this is associated with improved clinical outcomes and atherosclerosis regression. In fact, no threshold has yet been identified below which patients do not benefit from lowering of LDL-C.", 
    "7": "Statins are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Statins exert not only lipid-lowering but also other cellular effects, including antifibrotic properties. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of simvastatin on transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-1-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDFs) and to verify the mechanism of the effect of simvastatin in TGF-beta-1-induced myofibroblast differentiation in NPDFs.", 
    "8": "NPDFs were pretreated with simvastatin with or without mevalonate or Y-27643 for 2 hours before induction by TGF-beta-1. The expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and collagen type IV mRNA was determined by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the expression of alpha-SMA protein was determined by immunofluorescent cytochemical staining. Total soluble collagen production was analyzed by the SirCol collagen dye-binding assay (Biocolor, Belfast, U.K.). Phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 was evaluated by Western blot analysis.", 
    "9": "In TGF-beta-1-induced NPDFs, simvastatin significantly inhibited the expressions of \u03b1-SMA and collagen type IV mRNA and reduced alpha-SMA and collagen protein levels. Pretreatment with mevalonate reversed the effect of simvastatin. The expression of alpha-SMA mRNA and protein was significantly decreased by pretreatment with Y-27632. The TGF-beta-1-induced expression of pSmad 2/3 protein was notably decreased by pretreatment with simvastatin.",

    "11": "Statins enjoy widespread acceptance as effective drugs to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with and without cardiovascular disease, and are considered safe for long-term use. However, these compounds are contraindicated during pregnancy based on their potential teratogenic effects. Owing to the increasing number of young women eligible for statin therapy and the concern that the discontinuation of statin therapy might be harmful for both mother and child with hypercholesterolemia, gestational exposure to statins has increasingly become an issue of significant clinical importance. In this systematic review of both human and animal studies on the teratogenic effects of statins during pregnancy, we found that most of the available data in fact suggests that statins are unlikely to be teratogenic. In humans, the observed congenital anomalies were isolated and no consistent pattern has emerged to suggest that a common mechanism could underlie these observations. Animal studies show conflicting results, but in the reports in which an excess of congenital anomalies was reported in the statin-treated rodents, excessive doses were used compared with the regimens we commonly prescribe to human subjects.",

Results of the current study demonstrated that polar fractions of the RYR preparations contained herbal-drug interaction activity, which if left unremoved, enhanced P-glycoprotein activity and inhibited the major drug metabolizing cytochromes P450, i,e, CYP 1A2, 2C9 and 3A4. The data from Caco-2 cell absorption and animal model studies further demonstrated that the pharmacokinetic modulation effect by RYR preparations containing the polar fractions (\"untreated\" preparation) was greater than that from RYR preparations with the polar fractions removed (\"treated\" preparation). The data indicates a potential for herb-drug interactions to be present in RYR commonly sold as nutritional supplements when the polar fractions are not removed and this should be taken into consideration when RYR is consumed with medications, including verapamil.",

Markers of chronic low-grade inflammation, which are associated with an increased risk of CVD, are also elevated in PCOS. Clinical guidelines recommend the use of insulin sensitizers and statins to prevent CVD in some patients with PCOS. Current literature indicates that each of these medication classes has beneficial effects on inflammation, as well. Although there are currently no studies to determine whether these treatments decrease CVD in PCOS, it can be hypothesized that drugs impacting chronic inflammation may reduce cardiovascular risk. Some studies show that metformin, thiazolidinediones, and statins have beneficial effects on inflammatory markers in PCOS; however, the data are inconsistent.",

Current national guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. Lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease. On review of the literature, we conclude that current data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (<5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.",

Statins have been shown to ameliorate renal function and reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, the effects of statin on AGEs-induced tubular cell damage remain unknown. We examined here whether and how pravastatin could block the AGEs-RAGE-elicited tubular cell injury in vitro. Gene expression level was evaluated by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was measured with dihydroethidium staining. Apoptosis was analyzed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) expression was evaluated by immunostaining. Pravastatin dose-dependently inhibited the AGEs-induced up-regulation of RAGE mRNA level, ROS generation and apoptosis in human renal proximal tubular cells. Further, AGEs decreased mRNA level of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-2, an enzyme that mainly degrades asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase and subsequently increased ADMA generation in tubular cells, both of which were also prevented by pravastatin. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) treatment blocked all of the effects of pravastatin on tubular cells. We found that rosuvastatin also significantly blocked the AGEs-induced increase in RAGE mRNA level and ROS generation, both of which were prevented by GGPP. Our present study suggests that pravastatin could inhibit the AGEs-induced apoptosis and ADMA generation in tubular cells by suppressing RAGE expression probably via inhibition of GGPP synthesis. Pravastatin may exert beneficial effects on tubular damage in diabetic nephropathy by blocking the AGEs-RAGE axis.",

Statins attenuate hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in animal models, but the mechanism of action and applicability of these results to human treatment are not established. In hypoxic models, pulmonary artery fibroblast proliferation contributes substantially to pulmonary vascular remodeling. We previously showed that acute hypoxic pulmonary adventitial fibroblast proliferation can be selectively inhibited by statins and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase inhibitors. Here we used complementary chronic hypoxic and acute hypoxic coculture models to obtain necessary preclinical information regarding the utility of fluvastatin in the treatment of chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension. The effects of fluvastatin, cholesterol pathway intermediates, and related inhibitors on hypoxic adventitial fibroblast proliferation, p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation, and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation were determined, using complementary chronic hypoxic rat and acute hypoxic bovine cell models. Fluvastatin reversed the proliferative phenotypic switch in adventitial fibroblasts from chronic hypoxic animals. This effect was circulation-specific, and implicated a Rac1-p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway. Coculture and conditioned media experiments also implicated this statin-sensitive signaling pathway in the release of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell mitogens by hypoxic pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts. Treprostinil, sildenafil, and bosentan exerted no effect on the hypoxic fibroblast phenotype. Phenotypic changes (increased proliferation and mitogen release) in pulmonary artery fibroblasts during chronic hypoxia are dependent on a Rac1-p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway. The inhibition of these phenotypic changes with fluvastatin may be therapeutically relevant in high-altitude residents and in patients with hypoxic lung disease.",

During the 1-year period from September 2007 to August 2008, 60 ESRD patients with PRA levels more than 30% were enrolled into the study. Each patient was given oral simvastatin 10 mg/day as the initial dose. After one month, in those patients who did not respond, the dose was increased to 20 mg/day. Again, at the end of two months, if there was no response, the dose was further raised to 40 mg/day of simvastatin. The appropriate response to the treatment was defined as serum PRA levels getting reduced to less than 30%.

The mean age was 42.8 \u00b1 28.2 years (range 18-75). Among these, 34 (59.6%) were females. Before the study, the PRA levels were between 30 and 100 (mean \u00b1 SD: 60.4% \u00b1 20%). After the administration of simvastatin, a significant decrease in PRA levels was seen in our patients (P < 0.0001). In patients who had baseline PRA less than 40%, the PRA dropped to below 30% in 69.2% of the cases with 10 mg simvastatin. In those who had baseline PRA more than 40%, a similar reduction was seen only in 15.9% of the cases. However, in those who did not respond initially to 10 mg of simvastatin, statistically significant reductions were seen after the administration of 20 mg and, if needed, 40 mg of simvastatin (P = 0.001).

Impact of statin therapy at time of discharge from the index hospitalization on early (within the first year) and late (1 year to 4 years) TLR, was assessed in the SES stratum (statin group 2,735; nonstatin group 2,294) and in the BMS stratum (statin group 2,576; nonstatin group 2,616). Despite a significantly lower incidence of early TLR (7.8% vs 22.2%, p <0.0001), SES use compared to BMS use was associated with a significantly higher incidence of late TLR (7.7% vs 3.0%, p <0.0001). In the SES and BMS strata, the incidence of early TLR was similar regardless of statin use. In the SES stratum, the incidence of late TLR was significantly lower in the statin group than in the nonstatin group (6.1% vs 9.6%, p = 0.002), whereas no significant difference was found in the BMS stratum (2.6% vs 3.3%, p = 0.38).

    "78": "Current guidelines recommend the measurement of fasting lipid profile and use of statins in all patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the temporal trends of lipid testing and statin therapy in \"real-world\" patients with ACS are unclear. From January 1999 through December 2008, the prospective, multicenter, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE/GRACE(2)/CANRACE) enrolled 13,947 patients with ACS in Canada. We stratified the study population based on year of presentation into 3 groups (1999 to 2004, 2005 to 2006, and 2007 to 2008) and compared the use of lipid testing and use of statin therapy in hospital. Overall, 70.8% of patients underwent lipid testing and 79.4% received in-hospital statin therapy; these patients were younger and had lower GRACE risk scores (p <0.001 for the 2 comparisons) compared to those who did not. Over time there was a significant increase in rates of in-hospital statin therapy (70% in 1999 to 2004 to 84.5% in 2007 to 2008, p for trend < 0.001) but only a minor increase in rates of lipid testing (69.4% in 1999 to 2004 to 72.4% in 2007 to 2008, p for trend = 0.003). After adjusting for confounders, this increasing temporal trend remained statistically significant for statin therapy (p <0.001) but not for lipid testing.

In patients who did have lipid testing, those with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level >130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/L) were more likely to be treated with in-hospital statins. In conclusion, there has been a significant temporal increase in the use of in-hospital statin therapy but only a minor increase in lipid testing. Lipid testing was strongly associated with in-hospital statin use.

The E3 ubiquitin ligase, myosin regulatory light chain-interacting protein (Mylip)/inducible degrader of the LDL-R (Idol) was shown to induce degradation of LDLR via protein ubiquitination. We have here studied novel factors and mechanisms that may regulate Mylip/Idol in human hepatocyte cells and in mouse macrophages. We observed that FGF21 that is present in serum in different conditions reduced Mylip/Idol at the RNA and protein level, and increased LDLR levels and stability in the cells. FGF21 also enhanced expression of Canopy2 (Cnpy2)/MIR-interacting Saposin-like protein (Msap) that is known to interact with Mylip/Idol. Overexpression of Cnpy2/Msap increased LDLRs, and knockdown experiments showed that Cnpy2/Msap is crucial for the FGF21 effect on LDLRs. Experiments using DiI-labeled LDL particles showed that FGF21 increased lipoprotein uptake and the effect of FGF21 was additive to that of statins. Our results are consistent with an important role of FGF21 and Cnpy2/Msap in the regulation of LDLRs in cultured cells, which warrants further studies using human samples.",

Whether cholesterol regulates the signaling by mechanisms other than supporting the entirety of lipid raft microdomains is still unknown. By modulating cholesterol-enriched lipid raft microdomains and/or total cellular cholesterol contents in human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing \u00b5-opioid receptor, we concluded that cholesterol stabilized opioid signaling both by supporting the lipid raft's entirety and by facilitating G protein coupling. Similar phenomena were observed in the primary rat hippocampal neurons. In addition, reducing the brain cholesterol level with simvastatin impaired the analgesic effect of opioids in mice, whereas the opioid analgesic effect was enhanced in mice fed a high-cholesterol diet. Furthermore, when the records of patients were analyzed, an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and fentanyl doses used for anesthesia was identified, which suggested the mechanisms above could also be applicable to humans.

This study investigates hemodynamics, cardiac function/morphology, and mechanical properties of the central (heart, carotid artery) or peripheral [total peripheral resistance (TPR), forearm vascular bed] vasculature in individuals without (1-2 RFs: n\u2009=\u200928), or with (\u22653 RFs: n\u2009=\u200946) MetS.

There were no differences in heart size, carotid artery measurements, cardiovagal baroreflex, pulse-wave velocity, stroke volume index, or cardiac output index due to MetS after adjustments for statin and blood pressure medication use. The use of statins was associated with increased inertia in the brachial vascular bed, increased HbA1c and decreased LDL cholesterol. The independent use of anti-hypertensive medication was associated with decreased predicted [Formula: see text] triglycerides, diastolic blood pressure, interventricular septum thickness, calculated left ventricle mass, left ventricle posterior wall thickness, and left ventricle pre-ejection period, but increased carotid stiffness, HDL cholesterol, and heart rate. These data imply that both a central cardiac effect and a peripheral effect of vascular resistance are expressed in MetS. These data also indicate that variance in between-group responses due to pharmacological treatments are important factors to consider in studying cardiovascular changes in these individuals.",

Following genome-wide imputation, we combined data from the three studies in a meta-analysis. We found associations of LDL-c response to atorvastatin that reached genome-wide significance at rs10455872 (P = 6.13 \u00d7 10(-9)) within the LPA gene and at two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within the APOE region (rs445925; P = 2.22 \u00d7 10(-16) and rs4420638; P = 1.01 \u00d7 10(-11)) that are proxies for the \u03b52 and \u03b54 variants, respectively, in APOE. The novel association with the LPA SNP was replicated in the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial (P = 0.009). Using CARDS data, we further showed that atorvastatin therapy did not alter lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and that Lp(a) levels accounted for all of the associations of SNPs in the LPA gene and the apparent LDL-c response levels. However, statin therapy had a similar effect in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients in the top quartile for serum Lp(a) levels (HR = 0.60) compared with those in the lower three quartiles (HR = 0.66; P = 0.8 for interaction). The data emphasize that high Lp(a) levels affect the measurement of LDL-c and the clinical estimation of LDL-c response. Therefore, an apparently lower LDL-c response to statin therapy may indicate a need for measurement of Lp(a). However, statin therapy seems beneficial even in those with high Lp(a).",

Based on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathogenesis of NIHL, augmentation of the antioxidative defense system is a major target for pharmacological prevention. In this study, we assessed whether administration of pravastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, before noise exposure protects against cochlear injury in BALB/c mice. Noise exposure produced both compound threshold shift (CTS) and permanent threshold shift (PTS) over 40 dB at 16 and 32 kHz. Pretreatment with pravastatin (25 mg/kg) for 5 days significantly decreased both CTS and PTS. Pravastatin also reduced hair cell death after noise exposure in the cochlea, which was identified by surface preparation and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It also reduced the formation of noise-induced 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a byproduct of lipid peroxidation. Activation of Rac1, one of the subunits of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex, which is a major superoxide generator in the cell membrane, was inhibited by the administration of pravastatin. These findings suggest that pravastatin can protect against cochlear acoustic injury by lowering ROS generation via inhibition of the formation of the NADPH oxidase complex. This study will be helpful for the development of new therapeutic strategies for NIHL and other hearing loss-related diseases caused by ROS overproduction.",

    "124": "The effects of statin treatment in the setting of heart failure have already been shown. Nevertheless, there is little knowledge about its influence on adrenergic pathways in cardiomyocytes. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of cerivastatin on adrenoceptor-mediated signalling pathways in isolated adult ventricular cardiomyocytes. It focused on two endpoints: hypertrophic growth and TGFbeta expression. Cultured cardiomyocytes were used to study rac activation (analysed by its translocation into the membrane fraction), ROS formation (H(2)DCF fluorescence) and hypertrophic growth ((14)C-phenylalanine incorporation). Alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation showed significant differences regarding rac activation, ROS formation, and p38 MAP kinase activation. Both alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation induced TGFbeta expression. Upon activation of alpha-adrenergic signalling - although ROS formation was not influenced by cerivastatin - TGFbeta expression decreased. Following beta stimulation, TGFbeta expression as well as rac and p38 MAP kinase activation were reduced after pre-treatment with cerivastatin. Statin treatment did not show any influence on hypertrophic growth. In summary, this study clearly demonstrates the ability of adrenoceptor stimulation to increase TGFbeta expression. One component of the beneficial effects of statin therapy on heart failure might therefore be due to a dominant reduction and inhibition of TGFbeta, which is involved in many pathophysiological processes in cardiomyocytes.", 
    "125": "Endothelial senescence is thought to play a role in CAD (coronary artery disease). miR-34a (microRNA-34a) and other SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1)-related miRs have recently been found to target SIRT1 leading to endothelial senescence. In the present study, we investigated whether SIRT1-related miRs, including miR-9, miR-34a, miR-132, miR-181a, miR-195, miR-199a, miR-199b and miR-204, and SIRT1 were expressed in EPCs (endothelial progenitor cells) obtained from patients with CAD, and whether statins (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin) affected these levels. To determine the effects of miR-34a on SIRT1, cultured EPCs transfected with miR-34a were analysed for total SIRT1 protein levels. EPCs were obtained from 70 patients with CAD and 48 subjects without CAD. Patients with CAD were randomized to 8 months of treatment with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. EPCs were obtained from peripheral blood at baseline and after 8 months of statin therapy. Levels of miRs and SIRT1\u00a0in EPCs were measured by real-time RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) and FACS. Functional approaches to miR-34a have shown that transfection of miR-34a into EPCs resulted in regulation of SIRT1 expression. Levels of miR-34a were higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group, whereas levels of SIRT1 protein were lower in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group. There were no significant differences in other miRs (miR-9, miR-132, miR-181a, miR-195, miR-199a, miR-199b and miR-204) between the two groups. Levels of miR-34a were mildly negatively correlated with SIRT1 protein levels. A randomized clinical study has shown that the atorvastatin group had markedly decreased miR-34a levels and increased SIRT1 levels, whereas the rosuvastatin group showed no change in these levels. Levels of other miRs remained unchanged in the atorvastatin and rosuvastatin groups. In conclusion the results of the present study suggest that miR-34a may regulate SIRT1 expression in EPCs and that atorvastatin up-regulates SIRT1 expression via inhibition of miR-34a, possibly contributing to the beneficial effects of atorvastatin on endothelial function in CAD.", 
    "126": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common chronic systemic inflammatory disease leading to joint destruction and disability, is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Systemic inflammation and increased burden of traditional cardiovascular risk factors present in RA are currently considered responsible for the accelerated atherosclerosis in these patients. Herein, we highlight a potential double effect of dietary intake of the n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) on cardiovascular risk reduction and disease control in patients with RA. Large studies in non-RA populations provide strong evidence for the beneficial effect of n-3 LCP supplementation in primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention. Cardiovascular risk reduction is at least partly explained by n-3 LCP effects on blood pressure, dyslipidemia, thrombosis and inflammation, all important factors also in RA, whereas abnormalities in vascular function and in vascular morphology similar to those observed in RA patients may even be moderately reversed. On the other hand, there is evidence from 6 of 14 randomized controlled trials supporting a favorable effect of n-3 LCP supplementation in decreasing joint inflammation in RA. Although specific studies in RA patients are currently lacking, a double beneficial effect of n-3 LCP seems likely. The size of any such effect and how it compares with other interventions such as lifestyle changes, biologic therapies, and statin therapy, needs to be investigated prospectively in carefully designed studies.", 
    "127": "Ample evidence exists in support of the potent anti-inflammatory properties of statins. In cell studies and animal models statins exert beneficial cardiovascular effects. By inhibiting intracellular isoprenoids formation, statins suppress vascular and myocardial inflammation, favorably modulate vascular and myocardial redox state and improve nitric oxide bioavailability. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that further to their lipid lowering effects, statins are useful in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) due to their anti-inflammatory potential. The landmark JUPITER trial suggested that in subjects without CHD, suppression of low-grade inflammation by statins improves clinical outcome. However, recent trials have failed to document any clinical benefit with statins in high risk groups, such in heart failure or chronic kidney disease patients. In this review, we aim to summarize the existing evidence on statins as an anti-inflammatory agent in atherogenesis. We describe the molecular mechanisms responsible for the antiinflammatory effects of statins, as well as clinical data on the non lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory effects of statins on cardiovascular outcomes. Lastly, the controversy of the recent large randomized clinical trials and the issue of statin withdrawal are also discussed.", 
    "128": "Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and occurs in 1 in 9 persons with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Screening should begin at the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis to detect the presence of a decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and/or an elevated albumin excretion rate. The estimated GFR can be used to stage CKD, assess cardiovascular risk, and develop treatment strategies. A multifaceted treatment plan delivered using a collaborative care approach that fosters person self-management is important. Glucose-lowering agents should be selected based on renal function and titrated to achieve an A1c less than 7.0%. Lipid-lowering therapy with a statin should be utilized to achieve a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL, possibly less than 70 mg/dL. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or direct renin inhibitor, typically in combination with other antihypertensive therapies, is recommended for persons with hypertension, microalbuminuria/macroalbuminuria, and type 2 diabetes, as this approach has been shown to be renoprotective. Angiotensin-converting inhibitors have an additional benefit of improving cardiovascular outcomes in CKD.", 
    "129": "A standardized and evidence-based approach to the cardiological management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery has been recently defined by Task Forces of the American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) that published their guidelines in 2007 and 2009, respectively. Both the recommendations moved from risk indices to a practical, stepwise approach of the patient, which integrates clinical risk factors and test results with the estimated stress of the planned surgical procedure. In the present paper the main topics of the guidelines are discussed, and moreover, emphasis is placed on four controversial issues such as the use of prophylactic coronary revascularization in patients with myocardial ischemia, the perioperative management of patients with congestive heart failure, the routine use of betablockers and statins, and, finally, the management of antiplatelet therapies in patients with coronary stents. In addition to promoting an improvement of immediate perioperative care, the preoperative cardiological evaluation should be a challenge for identifying subjects with enhanced risk of cardiovascular events, who should be treated and monitored during a long-term follow-up.", 
    "130": "The burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) cannot be fully addressed by therapy targeting known pathophysiological pathways. Even with stringent control of all risk factors CVD events are only diminished by half. A number of additional pathways probably play a role in the development of CVD and might serve as novel therapeutic targets. Genome wide expression studies represent a powerful tool to identify such novel pathways. We compared the expression profiles in monocytes from twenty two young male patients with premature familial CAD with those from controls matched for age, sex and smoking status, without a family history of CVD. Since all patients were on statins and aspirin treatment, potentially affecting the expression of genes in monocytes, twelve controls were subsequently treated with simvastatin and aspirin for 6 and 2 weeks, respectively. By whole genome expression arrays six genes were identified to have differential expression in the monocytes of patients versus controls; ABCA1, ABCG1 and RGS1 were downregulated in patients, whereas ADRB2, FOLR3 and GSTM1 were upregulated. Differential expression of all genes, apart from GSTM1, was confirmed by qPCR. Aspirin and statins altered gene expression of ABCG1 and ADBR2. All finding were validated in a second group of twenty four patients and controls. Differential expression of ABCA1, RSG1 and ADBR2 was replicated. In conclusion, we identified these 3 genes to be expressed differently in CAD cases which might play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

This study investigates the potential therapeutic benefits of atorvastatin as an affordable treatment for pulmonary hypertension patients. 220 patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) were randomised, double-blind, to receive atrovastatin 10 mg daily or matching placebo in addition to supportive care. At 6 months, 6-min walk distance decreased by 16.6 m in the atorvastatin group and 14.1 m in the placebo group. The mean placebo-corrected treatment effect was -2.5 m (95% CI: -38-33; p=0.96), based on intention to treat. A small nonsignificant increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and fall in cardiac output was seen in both treatment groups. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients who improved, remained stable or showed a deterioration in World Health Organization functional class between atorvastatin and placebo treatments. Nine patients died in the atorvastatin group and 11 in the placebo group. Serum cholesterol levels fell significantly on atorvastatin treatment.

Evidence is accumulating that statin withdrawal after ischemic stroke may lead to worse outcome and that initiation of statins after ischemic stroke may reduce mortality and improve outcome. Current treatment guidelines recommend starting statins before discharge in patients with stroke related to atherosclerosis or who have elevated cholesterol. The primary treatment question then is not if to start statins in most ischemic stroke patients, but when. Our recommendation would be start a statin as soon as the patient passes a dysphagia screen and can safely take oral medication. Based on the results of the Heart Protection Study and the SPARCL trial, either simvastatin 40\u00a0mg or atorvastatin 80\u00a0mg are appropriate alternatives. Clinical trials are needed to demonstrate unequivocal efficacy of improved outcome and to determine if lower doses may have this effect.

The LUNAR study compared the efficacy of rosuvastatin with that of atorvastatin in decreasing LDL cholesterol in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Adult patients with coronary artery disease who were hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within 48 hours of first symptoms were randomized (n = 825) to an open-label, once-daily treatment with rosuvastatin 20 mg (RSV20), rosuvastatin 40 mg (RSV40), or atorvastatin 80 mg (ATV80) for 12 weeks. Patients were evaluated at weeks 2, 6, and 12. The primary end point was treatment efficacy in lowering LDL cholesterol averaged over 6 to 12 weeks. Changes in other lipoproteins, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and safety were evaluated. Analysis of covariance was used to compare least squares mean differences between each rosuvastatin treatment arm and the atorvastatin arm. The efficacy of RSV40 in lowering LDL cholesterol was significantly greater than that of ATV80 (46.8% vs 42.7% decrease, p = 0.02). LDL cholesterol lowering by RSV20 was similar to that by ATV80. Increases in HDL cholesterol were significantly greater with RSV40 (11.9%, p <0.001) and RSV20 (9.7%, p <0.01) than with ATV80 (5.6%). RSV40 was also significantly more effective than ATV80 in improving most other secondary efficacy variables, whereas the effects of RSV20 on these parameters were generally similar to those of ATV80. All 3 treatments were generally well tolerated over 12 weeks. In conclusion, results from the LUNAR study show that RSV40 more effectively decreased LDL cholesterol, increased HDL cholesterol, and improved other blood lipid parameters than ATV80 in patients with acute coronary syndrome.",

    "141": "The aim was to investigate whether rosuvastatin affect rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C11 and CYP2C6. CYP2C11 and CYP2C6 are considered as counterparts of human CYP2C9, which metabolizes many drugs including S-warfarin, diclofenac or ibuprofen. The male Wistar rats were fed standard laboratory diet (STD) or high cholesterol diet (HCD, 1% of cholesterol, 10% of lard fat) for 21 days. Rosuvastatin administration in STD (0.03% w/w) resulted in decreased mRNA expression of CYP2C11 as well as of CYP2C6 (here significant) and in a significant decrease of the respective protein expression as well as of the enzyme activity of both CYP2C forms. When rosuvastatin was administered in the HCD, the mRNA expression of both CYP2C forms was significantly lowered; the protein and activity parameters did not show significant changes. These results suggest that CYP2C11 as well as CYP2C6 expression and activity are negatively affected by rosuvastatin and may be modulated by high cholesterol high fat diet. Therefore, it should be taken into consideration that drugs metabolized by CYP2C9 in human could interact with rosuvastatin, as it has been already suggested for warfarin (rosuvastatin has increased its anticoagulant effect in human), and for telmisartan, sildenafil and glimepiride.",

As expected, subjects using statins vs. no statins had more cardiovascular risk factors, pointing to bias by indication. Statin users were more likely to have MAU (OR: 2.01, 95%CI: 1.34-3.01). The association between statin use and MAU remained significant after adjusting for the propensity to receive a statin based on cardiovascular risk factors (OR: 1.82, 95%CI: 1.14-2.91).

    "145": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible effects of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, on the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its main metabolite, desacetyldiltiazem, in rats. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and diltiazem are sometimes prescribed as a combination therapy for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The effect of simvastatin on P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 activity was evaluated. Simvastatin inhibited CYP3A4 enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner with a 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of 3.0 \u03bcM. In addition, simvastatin significantly enhanced the cellular accumulation of rhodamine-123 in MCF-7/ADR cells overexpressing P-gp. The pharmacokinetic parameters of diltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem were determined after oral and intravenous administration of diltiazem to rats in the presence and absence of simvastatin (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg). The areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the peak concentration (C(max)) of diltiazem were significantly (p < 0.05, 1.0 mg/kg) increased by 45.2% and 35.2%, respectively, in the presence of simvastatin compared to control. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability (AB) values of diltiazem in the presence of simvastatin (1.0 mg/kg) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher (44.8%) than that of the control group. Moreover, the relative bioavailability (RB) of diltiazem was 1.21- to 1.45-fold greater than that in the control group. The metabolite-parent AUC ratio (MR) in the presence of simvastatin (1.0 mg/kg) significantly decreased compared to the control group. This result implied that simvastatin effectively inhibited the metabolism of diltiazem. The increase in diltiazem oral bioavailability might be attributable to enhanced absorption in the small intestine via the inhibition of P-gp and to reduced first-pass metabolism of diltiazem via the inhibition of the CYP3A subfamily in the small intestine and/or in the liver rather than renal elimination of diltiazem by simvastatin.",

    "160": "Autophagy is a complex \"self-eating\" process and could be utilized for cell survival under stresses. Statins, which could reduce apoptosis in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) during both ischemia and hypoxia/serum deprivation (H/SD), have been proved to induce autophagy in some cell lines. We have previously shown that atorvastatin (ATV) could regulate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a positive modulator of autophagy, in MSCs. Thus, we hypothesized that autophagy activation through AMPK and its downstream molecule mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may be a novel mechanism of ATV to protect MSCs from apoptosis during H/SD. Here, we demonstrated that H/SD induced autophagy in MSCs significantly as identified by increasing acidic vesicular organelle-positive cells, type II of light chain 3 (LC3-II) expression, and autophagosome formation. The levels of H/SD-induced apoptosis were increased by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) while decreased by rapamycin, an autophagic inducer. ATV further enhanced the autophagic activity observed in MSCs exposed to H/SD. Treatment with 3-MA attenuated ATV-induced autophagy and abrogated the protective effects of ATV on MSC apoptosis, while rapamycin failed to cause additional effects on either autophagy or apoptosis compared with ATV alone. The phosphorylation of AMPK was upregulated whereas the phosphorylation of mTOR was downregulated in ATV-treated MSCs, which were both attenuated by AMPK inhibitor compound C. Further, treatment with compound C reduced the ATV-induced autophagy in MSCs under H/SD. These data suggest that autophagy plays a protective role in H/SD-induced apoptosis of MSCs, and ATV could effectively activate autophagy via AMPK/mTOR pathway to enhance MSC survival during H/SD.", 
    "161": "Pitavastatin (Livazo\u00ae, Livalo\u00ae), an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (statin), is indicated for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia, when response to diet and other non-pharmacological measures is inadequate. Pitavastatin has a favourable pharmacological profile following oral administration, including its long half-life (up to 12 hours), selective uptake into hepatocytes and minimal metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. This latter property decreases the likelihood of drug-drug interactions with agents that are metabolized by, inhibit or induce CYP enzymes. Pitavastatin improved the lipid profile (including LDL-C, TC and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) in patients with hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia, according to large, pivotal phase III studies of up to 60 weeks' duration. In these trials, pitavastatin for 12 weeks was noninferior to simvastatin and atorvastatin in terms of the improvement from baseline in LDL-C levels. In similarly designed trials, pitavastatin improved lipid profiles and was noninferior to simvastatin in patients with high cardiovascular risk and demonstrated significantly greater LDL-C reduction than pravastatin in elderly patients. Furthermore, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, although noninferiority criteria for the comparison with atorvastatin were not met in terms of the improvement from baseline in LDL-C levels, pitavastatin was associated with some improvements in the lipid profile. Pitavastatin also demonstrated substantial lipid-modifying effects in exclusively Asian populations in well designed clinical trials. Pitavastatin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 60 weeks' duration, with a tolerability profile generally similar to that of atorvastatin and simvastatin. Therefore, pitavastatin appears to be an attractive alternative for the treatment of patients with primary hyperlipidaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia who have not responded adequately to diet and other non-pharmacological measures, and may present a useful treatment option in patients requiring polypharmacy, such as those at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Further studies evaluating the effects of pitavastatin on clinical endpoints, such as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, are required to confirm the longer-term benefits of pitavastatin.", 
    "162": "Statins are HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors, which block the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate and have potent cholesterol lowering properties. Beyond their importance in the generation of lipid lowering effects, the regulatory effects of statins on the mevalonate pathway have a significant impact on multiple other cellular functions. There is now extensive evidence that statins have anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic properties, but the precise mechanisms by which such responses are generated are not well understood. In the present study we demonstrate that statins engage a member of the protein kinase C (PKC) family of proteins, PKC\u03b4, in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. Our study shows that atorvastatin and fluvastatin induce proteolytic activation of PKC\u03b4 in the APL NB4 cell line, which expresses the t(15;17) translocation. Such engagement of PKC\u03b4 results in induction of its kinase domain and downstream regulation of pathways important for statin-dependent leukemia cell differentiation. Our research shows that the function of PKC\u03b4 is essential for statin-induced leukemic cell differentiation, as demonstrated by studies involving selective targeting of PKC\u03b4 using siRNAs. We also demonstrate that the potent enhancing effects of statins on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced gene expression for CCL3 and CCL4 requires the function of PKC\u03b4, suggesting a mechanism by which statins may promote ATRA-induced antileukemic responses. Altogether, our data establish a novel function for PKC\u03b4 as a mediator of statin-induced differentiation of APL cells and antileukemic effects.",

We report a novel antibody 1B20 that binds to PCSK9 with sub-nanomolar affinity and antagonizes PCSK9 function in-vitro. In CETP/LDLR-hemi mice two successive doses of 1B20, administered 14 days apart at 3 or 10 mpk, induced dose dependent reductions in LDL-cholesterol (\u2265 25% for 7-14 days) that correlated well with the extent of PCSK9 occupancy by the antibody. In addition, 1B20 induces increases in total plasma antibody-bound PCSK9 levels and decreases in liver mRNA levels of SREBP-regulated genes PCSK9 and LDLR, with a time course that parallels decreases in plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). Consistent with this observation in mice, in statin-responsive human primary hepatocytes, 1B20 lowers PCSK9 and LDLR mRNA levels and raises serum steady-state levels of antibody-bound PCSK9. In addition, mRNA levels of several SREBP regulated genes involved in cholesterol and fatty-acid synthesis including ACSS2, FDPS, IDI1, MVD, HMGCR, and CYP51A1 were decreased significantly with antibody treatment of primary human hepatocytes. In rhesus monkeys, subcutaneous (SC) dosing of 1B20 dose-dependently induces robust LDL-C lowering (maximal ~70%), which is correlated with increases in target engagement and total antibody-bound PCSK9 levels. Importantly, a combination of 1B20 and Simvastatin in dyslipidemic rhesus monkeys reduced LDL-C more than either agent alone, consistent with a mechanism of action that predicts additive effects of anti-PCSK9 agents with statins. Our results suggest that antibodies targeting PCSK9 could provide patients powerful LDL lowering efficacy on top of statins, and lower cardiovascular risk.", 
    "172": "Although statin therapy is a cornerstone of current low density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering strategies, there is a need for additional therapies to incrementally lower plasma LDL cholesterol. In this study, we investigated the effect of several methylenedioxyphenol derivatives in regulating LDL cholesterol through induction of LDL receptor (LDLR). INV-403, a modified methylenedioxyphenol derivative, increased LDLR mRNA and protein expression in HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. These effects were apparent even under conditions of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. Electrophoresis migration shift assays demonstrated that INV-403 activates SREBP2 but not SREBP1c, with immunoblot analysis showing an increased expression of the mature form of SREBP2. Knockdown of SREBP2 reduced the effect of INV-403 on LDLR expression. The activation of SREBP2 by INV-403 is partly mediated by Akt/GSK3\u03b2 pathways through inhibition of phosphorylation-dependent degradation by ubiquitin-proteosome pathway. Treatment of C57Bl/6j mice with INV-403 for two weeks increased hepatic SREBP2 levels (mature form) and upregulated LDLR with concomitant lowering of plasma LDL levels. Transient expression of a LDLR promoter-reporter construct, a SRE-mutant LDLR promoter construct, and a SRE-only construct in HepG2 cells revealed an effect predominantly through a SRE-dependent mechanism. INV-403 lowered plasma LDL cholesterol levels through LDLR upregulation. These results indicate a role for small molecule approaches other than statins for lowering LDL cholesterol.",

It was found that even though a molecular mixture was achieved with all SVS-GPZ mixture ratios, no molecular interactions between the drugs could be detected. By formation of co-amorphous single-phase mixtures, only the dissolution rate of GPZ could be improved. The co-amorphous mixtures showed improved stability compared to the pure amorphous forms and the amorphous physical mixtures.

These compounds promoted the synthesis and evaluation of new inhibitors of HMGR, called HMGRIs. The high number of potential candidates need to create models of quantitative structure-activity relationship in order to guide the HMGRI (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutarylcoenzyme A inhibitor) synthesis. In this work, we revised different computational studies for a very large and heterogeneous series of HMGRIs. First, we revised QSAR studies with conceptual parameters how flexibility of rotation, probability of availability, etc; Next, using method of regression analysis; and QSAR studies in order to understand the essential structural requirement for binding with receptor. Next, we review 3D QSAR, CoMFA and CoMSIA with different compound to find out the structural requirements for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) inhibitory activity.", 
    "187": "The human organic anion-transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3) are liver-enriched membrane transporters of major importance to hepatic uptake of numerous endogenous compounds, including bile acids, steroid conjugates, hormones, and drugs, including the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Co-A reductase inhibitor (statin) family of cholesterol-lowering compounds. Despite their remarkable substrate overlap, there are notable exceptions: in particular, the gastrointestinal peptide hormone cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) is a high affinity substrate for OATP1B3 but not OATP1B1. We utilized homologous recombination of linear DNA by E. coli to generate a library of cDNA containing monomer size chimeric OATP1B1-1B3 and OATP1B3-1B1 transporters with randomly distributed chimeric junctions to identify three discrete regions of the transporter involved in conferring CCK-8 transport activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of three key residues in OATP1B1 transmembrane helices 1 and 10, and extracellular loop 6, to the corresponding residues in OATP1B3, resulted in a gain of CCK-8 transport by OATP1B1. The residues appear specific to CCK-8, as the mutations did not affect transport of the shared OATP1B substrate atorvastatin or the OATP1B1-specific substrate estrone sulfate. Regions involved in gain of CCK-8 transport by OATP1B1, when mapped to the crystal structures of bacterial transporters from the major facilitator superfamily, are positioned to suggest these regions could readily interact with drug substrates. Accordingly, our data provide new insight into the molecular determinants of the substrate specificity of these hepatic uptake transporters with relevance to targeted drug design and prediction of drug-drug interactions.",

    "189": "MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Biosis, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials via Ovid. Additional studies were identified through hand searches of bibliographies, trial Web sites, and clinical experts. Randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of perioperative statins in statin-naive patients undergoing cardiac and noncardiac surgery were included.", 
    "190": "Two investigators independently selected eligible studies from original research published in any language studying the effects of statin use on perioperative outcomes of interest.", 
    "191": "Two investigators performed independent article abstraction and quality assessment.", 
    "192": "Fifteen randomized controlled studies involving 2292 patients met the eligibility criteria. Random-effects meta-analyses of unadjusted and adjusted data were performed according to the method described by DerSimonian and Laird. Perioperative statin treatment decreased the risk of atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (relative risk [RR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.69; number needed to treat [NNT], 6). In cardiac and noncardiac surgery, perioperative statin treatment reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.74; NNT, 23) but not the risk of death (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.34 to 1.14). Statin treatment reduced mean length of hospital stay (standardized mean difference, -0.32; 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.11) but had no effect on length of intensive care unit stay (standardized mean difference, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.10).",

    "194": "Fenofibrate can be prescribed concomitantly with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) to improve achievement of lipid goals in patients with atherogenic mixed hyperlipidaemia. However, some safety concerns, particularly an increased risk of myopathy, have been reported when these drugs are taken together.", 
    "195": "The aim of this analysis was to assess the general safety and tolerability of a fenofibrate/pravastatin (FF/PRA) 160 mg/40 mg fixed-dose combination (FDC) capsule based on a pooled database of phase III clinical trials in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia.", 
    "196": "Safety data were pooled from five phase III studies (four double-blind with an uncontrolled extension and one open) of \u226512 to 64 weeks' duration. Adverse event (AE) profiles of FF/PRA 160 mg/40 mg (n=645 in the double-blind cohort) were evaluated relative to comparators (statins, n=519 or fenofibrate, n=122). Absolute incidence rates were calculated in both the double-blind cohort and the all-studies cohort (FF/PRA 160 mg/40 mg, n=1566) for all AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, AEs of specific interest including abnormal laboratory data, and deaths.", 
    "197": "The frequency and/or intensity of overall AEs, drug-related AEs, serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were not significantly increased for the FDC (36.0%, 12.3%, 1.7% and 5.1%, respectively) versus the statin (28.7%, 8.9%, 0.8% and 2.7%, respectively) and fenofibrate (59.0%, 21.3%, 0% and 4.9%, respectively) monotherapies. No deaths were reported during the course of treatment in clinical trials. Nevertheless, three deaths were reported more than 30 days after the patients completed the study; none of these deaths were assessed as being related to FF/PRA 160 mg/40 mg treatment. Among the AEs of special interest, no myopathy or rhabdomyolysis were reported; no patients were considered to have experienced a drug-induced liver injury; no case of pancreatitis occurred in the double-blind cohort and four patients reported pancreatitis in the all-studies cohort, two of them being study-treatment related; no case of pulmonary embolism was reported in the double-blind cohort and two patients presented with pulmonary embolism, unrelated to the study drug, in the all-studies cohort; there were more cases of decreased creatinine clearance in the FF/PRA 160 mg/40 mg group (1.7%) than in the statin group (0.6%).", 
    "198": "Within the limitations of this database (notably low percentage of very elderly patients, limited sample size of patients with mild renal insufficiency, and mode of selection in the clinical trials), no particular safety concern was raised with FF/PRA 160 mg/40 mg in the double-blind cohort as compared with statin and fenofibrate monotherapies. The acceptable long-term safety profile of FF/PRA 160 mg/40 mg was confirmed with a low frequency of AEs of interest, comparable to that observed in the 12-week double-blind cohort. Emergent effects possibly related to FF/PRA 160 mg/40 mg were mainly those attributable to fenofibrate (decrease in creatinine clearance and pancreatitis)."
