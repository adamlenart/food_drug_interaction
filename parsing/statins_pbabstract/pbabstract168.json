    "1": "Seventy-two rats were randomly divided into three groups: controls; low-dose atorvastatin (0.5 mg/kg/d); high-dose atorvastatin (2.5 mg/kg/d). Statin was administered daily by oral gavage for 7 days. After atorvastatin treatment, all animals in the three groups underwent 70% hepatectomy. Thereafter animals were subdivided into three subgroups, to evaluate the characteristics of liver regeneration proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), angiogenesis (KDR/Flk-1 [vascular endothelial growth factor-2]) and acute phase response (serum interleukin [IL]-6) at 12, 24, and 72 hours.", 
    "2": "At the 24 hours posthepatectomy, low-dose compared with high-dose atorvastatin increased liver regeneration (P = .004) and angiogenic responses compared also to controls (P = .026 and P = .059). However, there appeared no difference in IL-6 expression (P = .159). At the 72 hours posthepatectomy, low-dose atorvastatin treatment increased liver regeneration compared with controls (P = .047), but it showed no significant difference from the high-dose treatment (P = .109). Low doses of statin increased angiogenic responses compared with both control and high-dose animals (P = .016 and P = .002). Moreover, the high-dose group displayed decreased angiogenic responses compared with the control group (P = .044). Serum IL-6 expression was significantly greater among both low- and high-dose groups compared with controls (P = .005 and P = .003, respectively).", 
    "3": "Low-dose statin treatment increased KDR/Flk-1-dependent angiogenesis, which resulted in an increased regeneration response. In contrast, high-dose statin therapy decreased angiogenesis without affecting long-term regeneration responses. Finally, statin therapy may contribute to liver regeneration due to prolonged IL-6 expression independent of statin doses.", 
    "4": "Retrospective studies have suggested a beneficial effect of lipid-lowering treatment on the progression of aortic stenosis (AS) in milder stages of the disease. In the randomized, placebo-controlled Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study, 4.3 years of combined treatment with simvastatin 40 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg did not reduce aortic valve events (AVEs), while ischemic cardiovascular events (ICEs) were significantly reduced in the overall study population. However, the impact of baseline AS severity on treatment effect has not been reported. Baseline and outcomes data in 1,763 SEAS patients (mean age 67 years, 39% women) were used. The study population was divided into tertiles of baseline peak aortic jet velocity (tertile 1: \u2264 2.8 m/s; tertile 2: > 2.8 to 3.3 m/s; tertile 3: > 3.3 m/s). Treatment effect and interaction were tested in Cox regression analyses. The rates of AVEs and ICEs increased with increasing baseline severity of AS. In Cox regression analyses, higher baseline peak aortic jet velocity predicted higher rates of AVEs and ICEs in all tertiles (all p values < 0.05) and in the total study population (p < 0.001). Simvastatin-ezetimibe treatment was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in AVEs in any individual tertile. A significant quantitative interaction between the severity of AS and simvastatin-ezetimibe treatment effect was demonstrated for ICEs (p < 0.05) but not for AVEs (p = 0.10). In conclusion, the SEAS study results demonstrate a strong relation between baseline the severity of AS and the rate of cardiovascular events but no significant effect of lipid-lowering treatment on AVEs, even in the group with the mildest AS.", 
    "5": "Combinations of statins and fibrates may be increasingly prescribed to achieve lipid goals in high-risk patients and those with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as mixed dyslipidemia. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to compare rates of hospitalization for specific diagnoses in a cohort of new users of statins or fibrates, using claims data from a large United States health insurer. New users of statin, fibrate, or statin-fibrate therapy from 2004 to 2007 were identified; followed for hospitalization with rhabdomyolysis, renal impairment, hepatic injury, or pancreatitis; and confirmed by medical record review. Incidence rates (IRs) were compared across categories of fibrate or statin use, with adjusted IR ratios estimated using Poisson regression. A total of 584,784 patients initiated statins or fibrates. The IR of rhabdomyolysis in statins was 3.30 per 100,000 patient-years; the adjusted IR ratio for statin-fenofibrate combinations compared to statins alone was 3.75 (95% confidence interval 1.23 to 11.40). The IRs of renal impairment and pancreatitis in statins were 108.87 per 100,000 patient-years and 45.76 per 100,000 patient-years, respectively; the adjusted IR ratios for statin-fenofibrate combinations compared to statins alone were 1.47 (95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.93) and 2.87 (95% confidence interval 2.05 to 4.02), respectively. The IR of hepatic injury with statins was 8.57 per 100,000 patient-years, with no risk difference between exposure groups. In conclusion, the risk for rhabdomyolysis was low, although higher in patients newly treated with statin-fibrate concurrent therapy than those treated with either as monotherapy. The risk for pancreatitis was higher in patients treated with fenofibrate, whether in combination with statins or alone.", 
    "6": "Plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are an important predictor of cardiovascular disease, and achievement of lower targets of hsCRP with rosuvastatin treatment was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine whether hsCRP levels were related to genetic variants and traditional cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese patients treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg/day. The relations were analyzed between on-treatment plasma hsCRP concentrations and cardiovascular risk factors and 14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CRP and other candidate genes. In 281 patients with a median plasma hsCRP level of 0.81 mg/L (interquartile range 0.46 to 1.86), higher hsCRP levels were significantly associated with female gender, greater waist circumference (WC), having diabetes, higher triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1205, 3872G>A and rs2808630, 5237A>G in CRP and rs1169288, I27L in HNF1A) were independently associated with hsCRP levels before and after adjustment for other variables. WC and the CRP rs1205 polymorphism showed the strongest relations with hsCRP, and in multiple regression analysis, gender, WC, diabetes, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and the 3 genetic variants explained 35.5% of the variance in hsCRP levels. The 2 CRP polymorphisms, female gender, higher WC, and lower HDL cholesterol were associated with risk for having CRP concentrations \u2265 1 mg/L. In conclusion, central obesity, low HDL cholesterol, and CRP polymorphisms are major determinants of higher hsCRP levels in Chinese patients receiving treatment with rosuvastatin.", 
    "7": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic profiling identified urinary 1- and 3-methylhistidine (1- and 3-MH) as potential biomarkers of skeletal muscle toxicity in Sprague-Dawley rats following 7 and 14 daily doses of 0.5 or 1mg/kg cerivastatin. These metabolites were highly correlated to sex-, dose- and time-dependent development of cerivastatin-induced myotoxicity. Subsequently, the distribution and concentration of 1- and 3-MH were quantified in 18 tissues by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The methylhistidine isomers were most abundant in skeletal muscle with no fiber or sex differences observed; however, 3-MH was also present in cardiac and smooth muscle. In a second study, rats receiving 14 daily doses of 1mg/kg cerivastatin (a myotoxic dose) had 6- and 2-fold elevations in 1- and 3-MH in urine and had 11- and 3-fold increases in 1- and 3-MH in serum, respectively. Selectivity of these potential biomarkers was tested by dosing rats with the cardiotoxicant isoproterenol (0.5mg/kg), and a 2-fold decrease in urinary 1- and 3-MH was observed and attributed to the anabolic effect on skeletal muscle. These findings indicate that 1- and 3-MH may be useful urine and serum biomarkers of drug-induced skeletal muscle toxicity and hypertrophy in the rat, and further investigation into their use and limitations is warranted.",

    "10": "Fluvastatin was observed to enhance eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1177 and Ser-633 through the PI3-kinase/Akt and PKA pathways, respectively. Inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation using inhibitors of these pathways attenuated acute NO release in response to fluvastatin. The mRNA of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the first step of de novo BH4 synthesis, as well as eNOS, was upregulated in HUVEC treated with fluvastatin. In parallel with this observation, fluvastatin increased intracellular BH4. Pre-treatment of HUVEC with the selective GTPCH inhibitor, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine, reduced intracellular BH4 and decreased citrulline formation following stimulation with ionomycin. Furthermore, the potentiating effect of fluvastatin was reduced by limiting the cellular availability of BH4.", 
    "11": "Our data demonstrate that fluvastatin phosphorylates and activates eNOS, and increases eNOS expression in vascular endothelial cells. In addition to modulating eNOS, fluvastatin potentiates GTPCH gene expression and BH4 synthesis, thereby increasing NO production and preventing relative shortages of BH4.",

GPP is derived from mevalonate (MVA) and/or 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway(s), depending upon the metabolite and the plant system under consideration. PHB, however, is synthesized by only phenylpropanoid (PP) pathway. GPP and PHB are central moieties to yield shikonins through the synthesis of m-geranyl-p-hydroxybenzoate (GHB). Enzyme p-hydroxybenzoate-m-geranyltransferase (PGT) catalyses the coupling of GPP and PHB to yield GHB. The present research was carried out in shikonins yielding plant arnebia [Arnebia euchroma (Royle) Johnston], wherein no molecular work has been reported so far. The objective of the work was to identify the preferred GPP synthesizing pathway for shikonins biosynthesis, and to determine the regulatory genes involved in the biosynthesis of GPP, PHB and GHB.", 
    "25": "A cell suspension culture-based, low and high shikonins production systems were developed to facilitate pathway identification and finding the regulatory gene. Studies with mevinolin and fosmidomycin, inhibitors of MVA and MEP pathway, respectively suggested MVA as a preferred route of GPP supply for shikonins biosynthesis in arnebia. Accordingly, genes of MVA pathway (eight genes), PP pathway (three genes), and GHB biosynthesis were cloned. Expression studies showed down-regulation of all the genes in response to mevinolin treatment, whereas gene expression was not influenced by fosmidomycin. Expression of all the twelve genes vis-\u00e0-vis shikonins content in low and high shikonins production system, over a period of twelve days at frequent intervals, identified critical genes of shikonins biosynthesis in arnebia.",

    "27": "The world is facing an unprecedented increase in type 2 diabetes. Most disability and premature mortality experienced by people with diabetes is related to cardiovascular disease. This review summarizes recent evidence about approaches for managing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. While optimal blood pressure targets in people with diabetes remain uncertain, new data have demonstrated the benefits of routine blood pressure lowering in these patients, when administered without regard to initial blood pressure level. Other recent data indicate that blood pressure lowering treatment in patients with diabetes needs to be continued for ongoing benefit. The effects of intensive blood glucose lowering have been evaluated recently in a number of large trials, and individually these have failed to provide evidence of cardioprotection over a 4-5 year period. However, longer-term follow-up data suggest that there may be a delay in any such benefits becoming apparent. The benefits of statin therapy in preventing cardiovascular events in diabetic patients have been recently confirmed in a systematic overview of relevant trials; however, effects of fibrate therapy appear more limited. The role of antiplatelet agents remains unknown, as adequately powered trials of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes have not yet been completed.", 
    "28": "High efficacy of statin therapy in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) has been confirmed in numerous clinical trials. However, studies' results do not reflect patient benefits in everyday clinical practice. Observed discrepancies are the result of patients' failure to comply with medical recommendations regarding both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment. Non-compliance can lead to serious health and economic consequences.",

Xuezhikang, a partially extract of red yeast rice, contains a family of naturally occurring statins, and has a marked impact on lipids, but it is unknown whether Xuezhikang has any effect on BP during long-term follow-up in the Chinese population. This is a post-hoc subgroup analysis of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial, Chinese Coronary Secondary Prevention Study (CCSPS). A total of 2704 hypertensive patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) were assigned either to placebo (n = 1341) or to Xuezhikang (n = 1363) daily for an average of 4.5 years. The primary outcome was the unadjusted changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline to 6 months. We also assessed systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse pressure. Analysis of covariance was used to calculate the adjusted effects of treatment on changes in these outcomes at 6, 12, 24, and 48 months post-randomization, after controlling for potential confounders. This analysis included 2704/4870 (55.5%) hypertensive patients for whom BP was measured at baseline and at least one follow-up visit after randomization. Median duration of the follow-up was 4.5 years (54 months), and 25 patients (0.92%) were lost to the last follow-up because of adverse effects. The results showed that the unadjusted and adjusted changes in MAP, SBP, DBP, or pulse pressure from baseline were not significantly different for Xuezhikang or placebo recipients at 6, 12, 24, and 48 months after randomization. In this post-hoc subgroup analysis, we failed to demonstrate any significant reducing effects of Xuezhikang on BP in Chinese hypertensive patients with previous MI, suggesting that further prospective study on the effects of statins on BP would be needed, especially in high-risk patients.", 
    "34": "Structural remodeling of pulmonary artery plays an important role in maintaining sustained pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The anti-remodeling effects of statins have been reported in systemic hypertension. In this study, we studied the effects of atovastatin (Ato) or losartan (Los) in monocrotaline (MCL)-induced pulmonary artery remodeling using a rat model. Forty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned into four groups (n = 10): normal control (Ctr), PAH, PAH treated with Los, and PAH treated with Ato. We found that in the Los- or Ato-treated group, the mean pulmonary arterial pressure, right heart hypertrophy index, ratio of wall/lumen thickness (WT%), as well as the wall/lumen area (WA%) were significantly reduced compared to the PAH group. Also in pulmonary arteries dissected from rats in the Ato- or Los-treated group, in both mRNA and protein levels, the expression of \u03b11C subunit of voltage-gated calcium channel (Ca(v)\u03b11c) was downregulated, while sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA-2a) and inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate receptor 1 (IP3R-1) upregulated. However, the mRNA level of RyR-3 subunit of calcium regulating channel was increased, whereas its protein level was reduced in the treated groups. Our results suggest that atorvastatin or losartan may regress the remodeling of the pulmonary artery in pulmonary hypertensive rats, with differential expression of calcium regulating channels.",

The effect of the ABCG2 421C>A polymorphism on the lipid response to other substrate statins and clinical outcomes need to be evaluated in future studies.", 
    "39": "Rosuvastatin (Crestor\u00ae) is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) that has both lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects. The drug has various indications in the US, including the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with no clinical evidence of coronary heart disease who are at increased risk of CVD based on their age, a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level of \u22652\u2009mg/L, and at least one other CVD risk factor. The efficacy of rosuvastatin in apparently healthy women (aged \u226560 years) or men (aged \u226550 years) with normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and elevated hsCRP levels was demonstrated in the large, randomized, double-blind, multinational, JUPITER trial. Relative to placebo, rosuvastatin 20\u2009mg once daily for a median follow-up of 1.9 years significantly reduced the occurrence of first major cardiovascular events in this trial (primary endpoint). A between-group difference in favor of rosuvastatin was also demonstrated for various other endpoints, including overall deaths and the nonatherothrombotic endpoint of venous thromboembolism. Rosuvastatin remained more effective than placebo when primary endpoint results were stratified according to various baseline factors, including in patient subgroups thought to be at low risk of CVD. In addition, rosuvastatin was associated with reductions in LDL-C and hsCRP levels, and these reductions appeared to occur independently of each other. The greatest clinical benefit was observed in rosuvastatin recipients achieving an LDL-C level of <1.8\u2009mmol/L (<70\u2009mg/dL) and an hsCRP level of <2\u2009mg/L or, even more so, <1\u2009mg/L. Rosuvastatin was well tolerated in the JUPITER trial, with most adverse events being mild to moderate in severity. Myalgia, arthralgia, constipation, and nausea were the most commonly occurring treatment-related adverse events, and the incidence of monitored adverse events and laboratory measurements was generally similar in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups. It is not yet known whether the mechanism of benefit of rosuvastatin is via lipid effects, anti-inflammatory effects, or a mixture of both, and the use of rosuvastatin solely on the basis of elevated hsCRP levels is controversial. Nonetheless, the drug remains an important pharmacologic option in the prevention of CVD, and has demonstrated efficacy in preventing major cardiovascular events in apparently healthy women (aged \u226560 years) or men (aged \u226550 years) with normal LDL-C levels and elevated hsCRP levels.",

Here we evaluated the effects of Bothrops jararaca venom (vBj) and the treatments with lipoic acid (LA) and simvastatin (SA) on renal function, aminopeptidase (AP) activities and renal redox status. Primordial events for establishment of AKI by vBj were hyperuricemia, hypercreatinemia, urinary hyperosmolality, renal oxidative stress and reduction of hematocrit and protein content in the membrane of renal cortex and medulla and in the plasma. In the renal cortex and medulla the changes caused by vBj in soluble and membrane-bound AP activities had a similar pattern. The beneficial effects of LA and SA on envenomed mice were similar on the hyperuricemia, renal oxidative stress and reduction of hematocrit. LA mitigated the hypercreatinemia, but exacerbated the urinary urea and creatinine, whereas SA mitigated the decrease of plasma urea, urinary hyperosmolality and hypercreatinuria induced by vBj. The beneficial effects of LA and especially of SA on renal effects of vBj open a new perspective for clinical investigations of these drugs as coadjuvant agents in the serotherapy of Bothrops envenomation.",

A literature search of the PubMed database (January 1984 to April 2009) was performed using search terms that included: 'aged' (MeSH heading), 'elderly', 'anticholesteremic agents', 'antilipemic agents', 'hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'randomized controlled trial', 'meta-analysis' and 'drug safety'. Results from large, randomized, controlled trials show that statin therapy lowers both all-cause and coronary heart disease mortality and reduces myocardial infarction, stroke and the need for revascularization in individuals aged \u226565 years who have a history of coronary heart disease. Given the high rate of recurrent cardiovascular events in older adults, there is substantial potential for statin treatment to provide benefits in this population. When older patients are prescribed statins, attention should be given to potential drug interactions, age-related changes in drug pharmacokinetics, adverse effects such as myopathy and risks arising from co-morbid conditions. Additional studies on the benefits and risks of lipid-lowering therapy in individuals aged \u226570 years who have no history of cardiovascular disease, and particularly in those aged \u226580 years, are needed. Other available lipid-modifying drugs - bile acid sequestrants (bile acid binding protein modulators), ezetimibe, niacin and fibrates (fibric acid derivatives) - may be required in patients who are statin-intolerant or have mixed dyslipidaemia, or in whom standard doses of statins may not be sufficient to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals.", 
    "47": "Fenofibrate has been evaluated in the ACCORD trial, in combination with a statin, to prevent vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. In ACCORD-Lipid, the addition of fenofibrate was not able to significantly reduce the incidence of a composite cardiovascular endpoint (no positive effect was also observed with the intensification of blood glucose or blood pressure control in this population). However, an interaction effect was observed according to basal lipid profile, suggesting a better protection by fenofibrate in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia and low HDL cholesterol (so-called atherogenic dyslipidaemia). In ACCORD-Eye, the addition of fenofibrate to a basal statin therapy resulted in a significant reduction of the progression of diabetic retinopathy, in a similar manner as that observed with intensifying blood glucose control (but with a good safety profile and without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia). These observations, confirming earlier results from FIELD also with this fibrate, open new perspectives for a useful prescription of fenofibrate in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

    "52": "CD44 is a cell surface adhesion molecule for hyaluronan and is implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. Proteolytic cleavage of CD44 plays a critical role in the migration of tumor cells and is regulated by factors present in the tumor microenvironment, such as hyaluronan oligosaccharides and epidermal growth factor. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the proteolytic cleavage on membranes remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that cholesterol depletion with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, which disintegrates membrane lipid rafts, enhances CD44 shedding mediated by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) and that cholesterol depletion disorders CD44 localization to the lipid raft. We also evaluated the effect of long term cholesterol reduction using a statin agent and demonstrated that statin enhances CD44 shedding and suppresses tumor cell migration on a hyaluronan-coated substrate. Our results indicate that membrane lipid organization regulates CD44 shedding and propose a possible molecular mechanism by which cholesterol reduction might be effective for preventing and treating the progression of malignant tumors.", 
    "53": "Lovastatin and other statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which carries out an early step in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Statins lower cholesterol and are widely prescribed to prevent heart disease, but like many drugs, they can interact with nutritionally acquired metabolites. To probe these interactions, we explored the effect of a diverse library of metabolites on statin effectiveness using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. In yeast, treatment with lovastatin results in reduced growth. We combined lovastatin with the library of metabolites, and found that copper and zinc ions impaired the ability of the statin to inhibit yeast growth. Using an integrated genomic and metabolomic approach, we found that lovastatin plus metal synergistically upregulated some sterol biosynthesis genes. This altered pattern of gene expression resulted in greater flux through the sterol biosynthesis pathway and an increase in ergosterol levels. Each sterol intermediate level was correlated with expression of the upstream gene. Thus, the ergosterol biosynthetic response induced by statin is enhanced by copper and zinc. In cultured mammalian cells, these metals also rescued statin growth inhibition. Because copper and zinc impair the ability of statin to reduce sterol biosynthesis, dietary intake of these metals could have clinical relevance for statin treatment in humans.",

Thus, the authors conducted a population-based case-control study using medical databases from northern Denmark (1.7 million inhabitants) to identify 32,494 cases of gallstones occurring between 1996 and 2008 and to identify age-, sex-, and county-matched population controls for each case. Cases and their matched controls who were exposed to lipid-lowering drugs were categorized as current users if their last prescription was redeemed \u226490 days before the case's diagnosis date; otherwise, they were categorized as former users. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for gallstone disease in patients treated with lipid-lowering drugs.

Experimental animal models, based on intrastriatal injection of collagenase or autologous blood, have enabled great advances in elucidation of cellular/molecular events contributing to brain pathogenesis associated with ICH. Many lines of evidence indicate that blood constituents, including hemoglobin-derived products as well as proteases such as thrombin, play important roles in the pathogenic events. Inflammatory reactions involving neutrophils, activated microglia, and production of proinflammatory cytokines also constitute a critical aspect of pathology leading to neurodegeneration and tissue damage. Efforts are continuing to find drugs that potentially alleviate pathological and neurological outcomes of ICH. Various drugs that possess antioxidative, anti-inflammatory or neurotrophic/neuroprotective properties have been demonstrated to produce therapeutic effects on ICH animal models. Drugs already in clinical use such as minocycline, statins, and several nuclear receptor ligands are among the list of effective drugs, but whether they also show therapeutic efficacy in human ICH patients remains unproven. Here, current knowledge of ICH pathogenesis and problems arising with respect to exploration of new drug candidates are discussed.",

These drugs have been associated with improved respiratory health, and ongoing clinical trials are testing their therapeutic potential in asthma. We hypothesized that simvastatin treatment of ovalbumin (OVA)-exposed mice would attenuate early features of airway remodeling by a mevalonate-dependent mechanism. BALB/c mice initially were sensitized to OVA and then exposed to 1% OVA aerosol for 2 weeks after sensitization for 6 exposures. Simvastatin (40 mg/kg) or simvastatin plus MA (20 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally before each OVA exposure. Treatment with simvastatin attenuated goblet cell hyperplasia, arginase-1 protein expression, and total arginase enzyme activity, but it did not alter airway hydroxyproline content or transforming growth factor-\u03b21. Inhibition of goblet cell hyperplasia by simvastatin was mevalonate-dependent. No appreciable changes to airway smooth muscle cells were observed in any control or treatment groups. In conclusion, in an acute mouse model of allergic asthma, simvastatin inhibited early hallmarks of airway remodeling, which are indicators that can lead to airway thickening and fibrosis. Statins are potentially novel treatments for airway remodeling in asthma. Additional studies using subchronic or chronic allergen exposure models are needed to extend these initial findings.",

Drugs to treat hypercholesterolemia should thus have sufficient longterm lipid-lowering and direct antiatherosclerotic effects. Pitavastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) that was developed in Japan. In addition to its long-term lipid-lowering effects, pitavastatin also exerts pleiotropic effects against atherosclerotic changes. Although few studies have investigated the mechanism of pitavastatin, its pleiotropic effects have encouraged its use to treat both hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Pentraxin-related protein PTX3, a prototype protein of the pentraxin family, could serve as a novel useful blood marker to assess dynamic inflammation during the early atherosclerotic stages. This review clarifies the long-term lipid-lowering and antiatherosclerotic effects of pitavastatin.",

Mixed dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], elevated triglycerides and a high percentage of small, dense lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) is a common lipid disorder in diabetics and is considered especially atherogenic. Research suggests that in patients with dyslipidemia, combination therapy with fibrates and statins may be more effective than statin monotherapy alone. The choline salt of fenofibric acid (choline fibrate) is indicated for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia, either as a single treatment or in combination with statin therapy. It does not require first-pass metabolism, but dissociates in the gastrointestinal tract into the pharmacologically active fenofibric acid. This new formulation of fenofibric acid in combination with a low or moderate dose of statin has been shown to be effective in increasing HDL-C and lowering triglycerides beyond that provided by statin monotherapy alone. The ACCORD trial failed to show a mortality or morbidity benefit after combination therapy, although the data suggested that combination therapy may benefit patients with mixed dyslipidemia.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize the effect of simvastatin on myocardial fibrosis and collagen I deposition in the non-infarcted region after myocardial infarction (MI) and to identify the role of NF-\u03baB and osteopontin in simvastatin-mediated inhibition of post-MI collagen over-expression. A rat model of MI was generated by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. The rats surviving the MI operation were randomly divided into the following 3 groups: myocardial infarction (MI, vehicle), simvastatin (Sim, 30 mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7day-1), and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, 100 mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7day-1). Four weeks after MI, cardiac function, mRNAs, and protein expression in non-infarcted myocardium were analyzed. Myocardial fibrosis and collagen I over-expression were observed following MI, accompanied by an increase of NF-\u03baB and osteopontin. Simvastatin improved post-MI left ventricular dysfunction and ameliorated post-MI associated changes to several cardiac parameters, including the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), the maximal rate of pressure development (+dP/dtmax), and the maximal rate of pressure decline (-dP/dtmax). Concurrently, simvastatin significantly suppressed the over-expression of NF-\u03baB, osteopontin, and collagen I in the non-infarcted region following MI. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB by PDTC also reduced osteopontin over-expression and excessive collagen I production and improved the above functional myocardial parameters. These results show that post-MI myocardial fibrosis and collagen I over-expression in the non-infarcted region is associated with activation of NF-\u03baB and osteopontin up-regulation. The anti-fibrotic effect of simvastatin following MI is associated with the attenuation of the expression of osteopontin and NF-\u03baB. The inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation could be the process upstream of osteopontin suppression in the simvastatin-mediated effect.",

Bilateral vagatomy and high-dose perivagal capsaicin (250 \u03bcg/ml) treatment both blocked the PCF hypersensitivity induced by MCT. Three days of simvastatin (5 mg/kg) treatment significantly reduced the hypersensitive status of PCF. In MCT-PH rats, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was significantly elevated in both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage, but both showed a significantly decrease after simvastatin treatment. These potential benefits of simvastatin were all abolished by co-application of tin protoporphyrin-IX (SnPP), a specific heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) inhibitor.",

Recent clinico-epidemiologic studies correlate patients receiving statin therapy with having reduced mortality associated with severe bacterial infection. Investigating the effect of statins on the innate immune capacity of phagocytic cells against the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, we uncovered a beneficial effect of statins on bacterial clearance by phagocytes, although, paradoxically, both phagocytosis and oxidative burst were inhibited. Probing instead for an extracellular mechanism of killing, we found that statins boosted the production of antibacterial DNA-based extracellular traps (ETs) by human and murine neutrophils and also monocytes/macrophages. The effect of statins to induce phagocyte ETs was linked to sterol pathway inhibition. We conclude that a drug therapy taken chronically by millions alters the functional behavior of phagocytic cells, which could have ramifications for susceptibility and response to bacterial infections in these patients.",

We investigated whether certain statins (simvastatin or pitavastatin) could inhibit L-DOPA neurotoxicity. Neuronally-differentiated PC12 (nPC12) cells were treated with L-DOPA and/or statins for 24h, and their viabilities were measured using a cell counting kit, trypan blue staining, and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining. Free radical and specific intracellular signaling protein levels were measured with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and Western blotting, respectively. High concentrations of l-DOPA reduced nPC12 cell viability, but combined treatment with statins restored viability. Treatment with 200 \u03bcM L-DOPA increased free radical and hydroxyl radical levels, but combined treatment with 5 \u03bcM statins decreased these levels. Survival-related signaling proteins were decreased in nPC12 cells treated with 200 \u03bcM L-DOPA, but combined treatment with 5\u03bcM statins significantly increased the levels of these proteins. Treatment with 200 \u03bcM L-DOPA significantly increased death-related signaling proteins, while combined treatment with 5 \u03bcM statins reduced the levels of these proteins. Pretreatment with LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, before combined treatment with statins and L-DOPA almost completely blocked the protective effects of statins. These results indicate that statins reduce L-DOPA neurotoxicity by lowering oxidative stress and by enhancing survival signals and inhibiting death signals via activation of the PI3K pathway.",

There are six statins with four different doses and with different power-reducing LDL-c. By adding ezetimibe, there are 48 therapeutic possibilities. This extensive offer provides pharmaceutical treatment, but it is difficult to choose the most cost-effective statin because it is very difficult to remember all the powers and costs of treatment options.

The risk factors for CVD in diabetes are hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, obesity and sedentariness. More than 80% of patient with type 2 diabetes have hypertension and dyslipidemia and approximately 15% continue to smoke. However, all these factors are controlled in at least 10%. Although dyslipidemia is the most influential and least treated factor, the greatest benefit for CVD prevention is obtained with integrated intervention on all risk factors, reducing blood pressure to below 140/80 mmHg, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) to below 100 mg/dl, encouraging smoking cessation, regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight (BMI < 25 kg/m\u00b2). In secondary prevention or persons with microvascular disease, the targets may be stricter (blood pressure 130/80 mmHg and LDL-c 80 mg/dl). Drug treatment should always include an angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and a statin. Aspirin should be reserved for patients in secondary prevention or with very high CV risk.

This review discusses HDL-C-raising therapies and the role of HDL in the primary prevention of CHD in women. Lifestyle-based interventions such as dietary change, aerobic exercise regimens, and smoking cessation are initial steps that are effective in raising HDL-C, and available data suggest women respond similarly to men with these interventions. When combined with pharmacotherapy, the effects of these lifestyle alterations are further amplified. Though studies demonstrating gender-specific differences in therapy are limited, niacin continues to be the most effective agent in raising HDL-C levels, especially when used in combination with fibrate or statin therapy. Emerging treatments such as HDL mimetic therapy show much promise in further raising HDL-C levels and improving cardiovascular outcomes.",

Combinations of markers, including CD34+KDR+ or CD133+KDR+, are used. This approach, however may not consider all characteristics of EPC. The lack of a standardised protocol with regards to reagents and gating strategies may account for the widespread inter-laboratory variations in quantification of EPC.

The ISHAGE sequential strategy was used, and finally, CD45(dim)CD34(+) cells were quantified for KDR. A minimum of 100 CD34(+) events were collected. For comparison, CD45(+)CD34(+) and CD45(-)CD34(+) were analysed simultaneously. The number of CD45(dim)CD34(+)KDR(+) cells only were significantly higher in healthy controls compared to patients with CAD or ACS (p\u200a=\u200a0.005 each, p<0.001 for trend). An inverse correlation of CD45(dim)CD34(+)KDR(+) with disease activity (r\u200a=\u200a-0.475, p<0.001) was confirmed. Only CD45(dim)CD34(+)KDR(+) correlated inversely with the number of diseased coronaries (r\u200a=\u200a-0.344; p<0.005). In a second study, a 4-week de-novo treatment of atorvastatin in stable CAD evoked an increase only of CD45(dim)CD34(+)KDR(+) EPC (p<0.05).

Resolution was held to be a passive process, a concept now overturned with new evidence demonstrating that resolution is actively orchestrated by distinct cellular events and endogenous chemical mediators. Among these, lipid mediators, such as the lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and newly identified maresins, have emerged as a novel genus of potent and stereoselective players that counter-regulate excessive acute inflammation and stimulate molecular and cellular events that define resolution. Given that uncontrolled, chronic inflammation is associated with many cardiovascular pathologies, an appreciation of the endogenous pathways and mediators that control timely resolution can open new terrain for therapeutic approaches targeted at stimulating resolution of local inflammation, as well as correcting the impact of chronic inflammation in cardiovascular disorders. Here, we overview and update the biosynthesis and actions of proresolving lipid mediators, highlighting their diverse protective roles relevant to vascular systems and their relation to aspirin and statin therapies.",

We report here both the verification of the reconstitution of fully functional holo-LovF by using (13)C-labeled malonyl-CoA to form \u03b1-methylbutyrate functionality and also detection of five predicted intermediates covalently bound to the 4'-phosphopantetheine at the acyl carrier protein (ACP) active site utilizing the phosphopantetheine ejection assay and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Under in vitro conditions, the diketide acetoacetyl intermediate did not accumulate on the ACP active site of holo-LovF following incubation with malonyl-CoA substrate. We found that incubation of holo-LovF with acetoacetyl-CoA served as an effective means of loading the diketide intermediate onto the ACP active site of LovF. Our results demonstrate that subsequent \u03b1-methylation of the acetoacetyl intermediate stabilizes the intermediate onto the ACP active site and facilitates the formation and mass spectrometric detection of additional intermediates en route to the formation of \u03b1-methylbutyrate.",

    "168": "A primary defect in the vascular action of insulin may be the key intermediate mechanism that links endothelial dysfunction with diabetes mellitus and hyperhomocysteinemia. This study investigated the downstream targets of insulin, involved in this process. Hyperhomocysteinemia (serum homocysteine > 10 \u03bcm/l) was produced in rats by administering L-methionine (1.7% w/w, p.o.x. 4 weeks) and diabetes mellitus (serum glucose > 140 mg/dl) was induced using streptozotocin (55 mg/kg/day, i.v. once) in another group. Four weeks after L-methionine and streptozotocin administration, vascular endothelium dysfunction was assessed in terms of attenuation of acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation (isolated aortic ring preparation), decrease in serum nitrate/nitrite level, as well as mRNA expression of eNOS (rtPCR), and disruption of integrity of vascular endothelium. Both hyperhomocysteinemia and diabetes mellitus significantly attenuated acetylcholine-induced endothelial-dependent relaxation, and the increase in serum nitrite/nitrate concentration and the expression of eNOS. Insulin (0.4 and 0.6 IU/kg/day, s.c.) and atorvastatin (30 mg/kg/day, p.o.x. 4 weeks) significantly improved all these parameters. However, this ameliorative effect of insulin was blocked by 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) [Inhibitor of phosphoinositide dependent kinase (PDK)], and triciribine (API-2) (protein kinase B/Akt inhibitor). It is suggested that amelioration of vascular endothelium dysfunction by insulin may be due to stimulation of PDK and Akt pathways.", 
    "169": "Recent studies have identified proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and Idol as negative regulators of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein stability. While the induction of PCSK9 transcription has been recognized as a limitation to the statin cholesterol-lowering efficacy at higher doses, it is unknown whether Idol is involved in the statin-mediated up-regulation of the hepatic LDLR. Here we report that statins exert opposite effects on PCSK9 and Idol gene expression in human hepatoma-derived cell lines and primary hepatocytes isolated from hamsters and rats. While PCSK9 expression was induced, the level of Idol mRNA rapidly declined in statin-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. This differs from the effect of the liver X receptor ligand, GW3965, which increased the expression of both PCSK9 and Idol. We further show that cellular depletion of Idol by siRNA transfection did not change PCSK9 expression levels in control and statin-treated cells; however, the basal level of LDLR protein increased by 60% in Idol siRNA transfected HepG2 cells. More importantly, the increase in LDLR protein abundance by rosuvastatin and atorvastatin treatment was compromised by Idol siRNA transfection. Collectively, our present findings suggest that the suppression of Idol gene expression in liver cells is an additional mechanism underlying the statin-induced up-regulation of hepatic LDLR expression. This may contribute to the hypocholesterolemic effects of statins observed in clinical settings.",

Detection was performed with an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring. The standard calibration curves of atorvastatin and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin were linear in the concentration range of 0.2-20 and 0.1-20 ng/mL, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precisions were < 7.7% and the accuracy was within \u00b1 5.9%. The method has been successfully used for the study of the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin in Chinese patients with coronary heart disease after a single oral dose of 20 mg atorvastatin.

Traditional cardiovascular risk factors cannot entirely explain the higher level of cardiovascular complications, and there is growing evidence that chronic inflammation is the main culprit. The aims of this review of the literature are to (i) summarize aspects of vascular alterations found in the cardiovascular system of RA patients and to relate them to the clinically relevant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and (ii) evaluate what these abnormalities and complications might in the end imply for clinical management. A number of abnormalities in the cardiovascular system of RA patients have been identified, on the molecular level, in endothelial function, arterial stiffness, arterial morphology and, finally, in the clinical presentation of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular risk assessment should be part of the care of RA patients. While a great deal of data is published demonstrating abnormalities in the cardiovascular system of these patients, it is much less clear what specific interventions should be performed to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular complications. Cardiovascular care should be delivered in accordance with recommendations for the general population. Whether specific drugs (e.g. statins, aspirin) are of particular benefit in RA patients needs further investigation. Control of inflammation appears to be of benefit. Methotrexate and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 blocking agents might reduce the number of cardiovascular events. Leflunomide, cyclosporine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors may worsen cardiovascular outcome.

    "193": "Forty-five out-patients with hyperlipemia who met the entry criteria were enrolled and randomized into two groups in the ratio of 2: 1, 30 patients in the ZKG group and 15 patients in the simvastatin group. The lipid lowering effects and safety of treatment during the 24-week therapeutic period, as well as the influence of treatment on plasma high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) level in patients were observed.", 
    "194": "No significant difference between the two groups was observed in serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) at the 4th, 8th, 12th and 24th week (P > 0.05). However, as compared with baseline, significant reduction of TC and LDL-C in both groups was shown at all the observing time points (P < 0.01), while the changes in TG and HDL-C were insignificant (P > 0.05). The control rates of LDL-C and TC in the ZKG group and the simvastatin group were 86.7% (26/30) versus 100% (15/15) at the 4th week, 80.0% (24/30) versus 100% (15/15) at the 8th week, 53.3% (16/30) versus 60.0% (9/15) at the 12th week, and 90.0% (27/30) versus 93.3% (14/15) at the 24th week, respectively, all showed insignificant difference between groups. No statistical differences were found between groups in levels of plasma transaminase, creatinine, uric acid and hs-CRP (P > 0.05).",

    "196": "We previously reported that simvastatin induces estrogen receptor-alpha (ER\u03b1) in murine bone marrow stromal cells in vitro. In this study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on ER\u03b1 expression in bone and uterus in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and evaluated bone mass, bone strength, and uterine wet weight. Three-month-old Sprague-Dawley female rats received OVX or sham operation. Six weeks later, the rats were treated orally with simvastatin (5 or 10\u00a0mg/kg/day), or intraperitoneally with 17-\u03b2-estradiol (E(2)) or a combination of simvastatin and E(2) for 6\u00a0weeks. Uterine wet weight, bone mineral density (BMD) of lumbar vertebrae, biomechanics of lumbar vertebrae, and induction of ER\u03b1 expression in the bone and uterus were analyzed. The 6-week simvastatin treatment improved lumbar vertebral BMD and boosted biomechanical performance of the vertebral body compared to the OVX control, suggesting that simvastatin can treat osteoporosis caused by estrogen deficiency. More interestingly, simvastatin could increase ER\u03b1 expression and synergy with estradiol in bone while antagonizing estradiol in the uterus, along with uterus atrophy and uterine wet weight decreases. In conclusion, these data suggest that simvastatin exert opposing modulatory effects on ER\u03b1 expression on bone and uterus in ovariectomized rats, inducing ER\u03b1 expression and synergy with estrogen to perform anabolic effects on the bones while decreasing E2 efficacy and uterine wet weight. This finding may be helpful to explain the mechanism of statin treatment in osteoporosis caused by estrogen deficiency.", 
    "197": "Rosuvastatin (RSV) is a synthetic statin with favourable pharmacologic properties including minimal metabolism, hepatic selectivity and enhanced inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. An induction of osteoblast differentiation has been reported in vitro with lipophilic statins but not with RSV, which, like pravastatin, is relatively hydrophilic compared with other statins. To mediate its action, an active transport mechanism via solute carrier (SLC) transporters from the SLC16, SLC21/SLCO and SLC22 gene family - specifically Slc16a1, Slco1a1, Slco2b1 and Slc22a8 - may be present to allow effective entry in osteoblastic cells. In this study, we demonstrate that RSV induced osteoblast differentiation, as measured by increased BMP-2 gene expression and secretion, and ALP activity in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cells, without significantly affecting cell proliferation within the concentration range of 0.001-10 \u03bcM. Low concentrations of RSV (0.001-0.01 \u03bcM) were protective against cell death whereas higher concentrations (10-100 \u03bcM) showed cytotoxicity. Moreover, MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts expressed high levels of Slco1a1 and Slc16a1 mRNA and low levels of Slco2b1 and Slc22a8 mRNA, when compared with kidney and liver tissues from mice. Slco1a1 gene expression increased 12-fold during osteoblast differentiation and was further regulated after RSV treatment. In conclusion, as for other statins, RSV promotes osteoblast differentiation, and also, demonstrated for the first time, regulates the expression of Slco1a1, which may constitute the transport system for RSV across the cell membrane in mature osteoblasts.",

    "199": "One hundred and twenty-three subjects with hyperlipidaemia and 68 systemically healthy controls (C) were included in the study. Hyperlipidaemic groups were divided into two groups as suggested diet (HD) and prescribed statin (HS). Both groups were divided into three subgroups as healthy (h), gingivitis (g) and periodontitis (p). The clinical periodontal parameters, fasting venous blood and GCF samples were obtained, and serum tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-6 levels were evaluated.", 
    "200": "The ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (TC/HDL) was associated with gingival index and percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP%) in both hyperlipidaemic groups. In HS group, GCF and serum IL-6 were positively correlated with BOP% and TC/HDL. GCF TNF-\u03b1 was positively associated with probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level, whereas serum TNF-\u03b1 was associated with BOP% in the HD group. Serum and GCF TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were significantly associated with TC/HDL in the HD group.",

    "202": "Red yeast rice is an ancient Chinese dietary staple and medication used by millions of patients as an alternative therapy for hypercholesterolemia. In recent years, the use of red yeast rice has grown exponentially due to increased public interest in complementary and alternative medications and the publication of several randomized, controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy and safety in different populations. The most promising role for red yeast rice is as an alternative lipid-lowering therapy for patients who refuse to take statins because of philosophical reasons or patients who are unable to tolerate statin therapy due to statin-associated myalgias. However, there is limited government oversight of red yeast rice products, wide variability of active ingredients in available formulations, and the potential of toxic byproducts. Therefore, until red yeast rice products are regulated and standardized, physicians and patients should be cautious in recommending this promising alternative therapy for hyperlipidemia.", 
    "203": "Cerebral ischaemia is a leading cause of death and disability. The objective of the present investigation was to explore the neuroprotective potentials of candesartan and atorvastatin alone and their combination against the cerebral ischaemia induced behavioral, biochemical, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Male Wistar rats (200-220 g) were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion for 30 min followed by 24 h reperfusion. Candesartan (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) and atorvastatin (10 and 20 mg/kg) were pretreated for 7 days before animals were subjected to ischaemia reperfusion injury. Various behavioral tests (locomotor activity and rotarod performance), biochemical parameters (Malondialdehyde levels, nitrite concentration, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity, redox ratio, and GST) and mitochondrial enzyme (Complex I, II, III, and IV) dysfunctions were measured in cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of the ischaemic brain. Seven days candesartan (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) or atorvastatin (10 and 20 mg/kg) pretreatment significantly attenuated neurobehavioral alterations, oxidative damage and restored mitochondrial enzyme dysfunction as compared to control (I/R) group. Further, combined treatment of candesartan (0.1 mg/kg) and atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) significantly potentiated their protective effect which was significant as compared to their effect alone. Present study suggests the protective effect of candesartan and atorvastatin and their combination against ischaemia reperfusion induced behavioral and biochemical alterations in rats.", 
    "204": "The human colon contains a diverse microbial population which contributes to degradation and metabolism of food components. Drug metabolism in the colon is generally poorly understood. Metabolomics techniques and in vitro colon models are now available which afford detailed characterization of drug metabolites in the context of colon metabolism. The aim of this work was to identify novel drug metabolites of Simvastatin (SV) by using an anaerobic human in vitro colon model at body temperature coupled with systems biology platform, excluding the metabolism of the host liver and intestinal epithelia. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with a time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS) was used for the metabolomic analysis. Metabolites showing the most significant differences in the active faecal suspension were elucidated in reference with SV fragmentation and compared with controls: inactive suspension or buffer with SV, or with active suspension alone. Finally, time courses of selected metabolites were investigated. Our data suggest that SV is degraded by hydrolytic cleavage of methylbutanoic acid from the SV backbone. Metabolism involves demethylation of dimethylbutanoic acid, hydroxylation/dehydroxylation and \u03b2-oxidation resulting in the production of 2-hydroxyisovaleric acid (3-methyl-2-hydroxybutanoic acid), 3-hydroxybutanoic acid and lactic acid (2-hydroxypropanoic acid), and finally re-cyclisation of heptanoic acid (possibly de-esterified and cleaved methylpyranyl arm) to produce cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. Our study elucidates a pathway of colonic microbial metabolism of SV as well as demonstrates the applicability of the in vitro colon model and metabolomics to the discovery of novel drug metabolites from drug response profiles.", 
    "205": "Loading erythrocytes with Primaquine (PQ) is advantageous. However, PQ produces damage to erythrocytes through free radicals production. Statins have antioxidant action and are involved in protective effect against situation of oxidative stress. Thus the protective effect of pravastatin (PS) against PQ induced oxidative damage to human erythrocytes was investigated in the current studies upon loading to erythrocytes.The erythrocytes were classified into; control erythrocytes, erythrocytes incubated with either 2 mM of PS or 2 mM of PQ, and erythrocytes incubated with combination of PS plus PQ. After incubation for 30 min, the effect of the drugs on erythrocytes hemolysis as well as some biomarkers of oxidative stress (none protein thiols, protein carbonyl, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) were investigated.Our results revealed that PS maintains these biomarkers at values similar to that of control ones. On the other hand, PQ cause significant increases of protein carbonyl by 115% and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance by 225% while non-protein thiols were significantly decreased by 112 % compared with control erythrocytes. PS pre-incubation before PQ exerts marked reduction of these markers in comparison with PQ alone. Moreover, at NaCl concentrations between 0.4% and 0.8%, PQ causes significant increase of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) hemolysis in comparison with the other groups (P<0. 001). Scanning electron micrograph indicates spherocytes formation by PQ incubation, but in the other groups the discocyte shape of erythrocytes was preserved.The reduction of protein oxidation and lipids peroxidation by PS is related to antioxidants effect of this statin. Preservation of erythrocytes fragility and morphology by PS are related to its free radicals scavenging effect. It is concluded that pravastatin has protective effect against erythrocytes dysfunction related any situations associated with increased oxidative stress, especially when loaded with PQ."
