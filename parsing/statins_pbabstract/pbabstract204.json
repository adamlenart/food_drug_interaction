Medication adherence was evaluated by calculating the medication possession ratio (%MPR = days supplylactual days to refill x 100) for each drug. Medication persistency was defined as the proportion of subjects having filled a prescription in the last 30 days of the 2-year period. CPAP use was assessed at every follow-up visit after the treatment was prescribed.

Tissue glucose uptake was determined using 2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose. The treatment of mice with pravastatin attenuated the increase in the plasma glucose level during OGTT in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the plasma insulin level. Pravastatin increased glucose uptake in insulin-sensitive tissue such as the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue after treatment at 5-20 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 2 weeks, but not at 1 mg kg(-1) day(-1). The combination of a noneffective dose of pravastatin (1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) and a noneffective dose of olmesartan (0.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) synergistically improved OGTT without affecting the plasma insulin level. This combination also increased 2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose uptake in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The effects of pravastatin or olmesartan on OGTT and tissue 2-[(3)H]deoxyglucose uptake were significantly enhanced by an antioxidant, tempol, whereas the effects of a pravastatin-olmesartan combination were not further enhanced by tempol. These results indicate that the combination of pravastatin and olmesartan synergistically improves glucose intolerance through an increase in tissue glucose uptake. The effects seem to be mediated by an increase in insulin sensitivity through the inhibition of oxidative stress.",

Our previous work showed that type II diabetic rats [Goto-Kakizaki (GK)] have more bleeding after stroke than their normoglycemic controls (Wistar). Our aim was to evaluate the vascular protective properties of acute atorvastatin therapy after experimental ischemic stroke in diabetes and to explore the effect of stroke in GK rats compared with their normoglycemic controls. Fifty male Wistar and 40 GK rats (270-305 g) underwent 3 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion for 21 h. Animals received atorvastatin (5 mg/kg), atorvastatin (15 mg/kg), or vehicle, administered by oral gavage, one dose 5 min after reperfusion and a second dose after 12 h. At 24 h, functional outcome was measured, and brain tissue was analyzed for infarct volume, hemoglobin content, and molecular biomarkers. Plasma was collected for analysis of atorvastatin concentrations. Atorvastatin-treated groups had significantly lower bleeding rates (p = 0.0011) and infarct volume (p = 0.0007) compared with controls. There was a significant reduction in hemoglobin content and infarct volume only in the higher dose group (15 mg/kg) (p < 0.05), and these benefits were more than 4 times greater in the diabetic animals. Atorvastatin (15 mg/kg) improved neurological outcome in both Wistar and GK rats (p = 0.029) at a peak concentration of 27 to 77 ng/ml and was associated with an increase in Akt phosphorylation (p = 0.0007).

Data have shown that even relatively small reductions in both blood pressure and cholesterol levels can lead to large reductions in the risk for cardiovascular events. However, though there are robust data on the beneficial effect of concomitant reduction in these risk factors, the reality is that this is achieved in <10% of patients. There is nonadherence with prescribed therapies with up to 50% of patients stopping their medications of their own volition for a variety of reasons. There is a reasonable evidence base to suggest that simplifying drug regimens and reducing pill burden will enhance patient adherence.

Patients with high levels of high specificity C-reactive protein and having LDL cholesterol less than 3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) in primary prevention settings benefited from aggressive LDL cholesterol reduction with rosuvastatin over a 2-year period.

Neurofibromin encoded by the NF1 causal gene regulates Ras/MAPK and cAMP signaling pathways. These signaling pathways play critical roles in controlling gene transcription during synaptic plasticity and memory formation. We hypothesized that NF1 mutations disturb the expression of genes important for memory formation. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA microarray analysis on the hippocampus of NF1(+/-) mice, the mouse model for NF1 learning disabilities. Our results indicated that genes involved in a wide spectrum of biological processes are dysregulated in the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. Many of the NF1-affected genes play critical roles in synaptic plasticity, such as Rabs, synaptotagmins, NMDAR1, CaMKII, and CREB1. Because NF1-associated learning disabilities can be reversed by lovastatin, we also determined the effect of lovastatin treatment on genome-wide expression patterns of the NF1(+/-) hippocampus. We found that lovastatin altered the expression of a large number of genes, including those disturbed by NF1 mutations. Our results reveal a genome-wide overview of the molecular abnormalities in the NF1(+/-) hippocampus and should be useful for further identifying the novel molecular pathways that cause NF1 learning deficits.",

    "58": "Atorvastatin has been shown to reduce resistin expression in macrophages after pro-inflammatory stimulation. However, the mechanism of reducing resistin expression by atorvastatin is not known. Therefore, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms of atorvastatin for reducing resistin expression after proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulation in cultured macrophages. Cultured macrophages were obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TNF-alpha stimulation increased resistin protein and mRNA expression and atorvastatin inhibited the induction of resistin by TNF-alpha. Addition of mevalonate induced resistin protein expression similar to TNF-alpha stimulation. However, atorvastatin did not have effect on resistin protein expression induced by mevalonate. SP600125 and JNK small interfering RNA (siRNA) completely attenuated the resistin protein expression induced by TNF-alpha and mevalonate. TNF-alpha induced phosphorylation of Rac, while atorvastatin and Rac-1 inhibitor inhibited the phosphorylation of Rac induced by TNF-alpha. The gel shift and promoter activity assay showed that TNF-alpha increased AP-1-binding activity and resistin promoter activity, while SP600125 and atorvastatin inhibited the AP-1-binding activity and resistin promoter activity induced by TNF-alpha. Recombinant resistin and TNF-alpha significantly reduced glucose uptake in cultured macrophages, while atorvastatin reversed the reduced glucose uptake by TNF-alpha. In conclusion, JNK and Rac pathway mediates the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on resistin expression induced by TNF-alpha.",

MS has rarely been conducted in retrospective studies, because historically, available samples for protein analyses were limited to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archived tissue specimens. Reliable methods for obtaining proteomic profiles from FFPE samples are needed. Proteomic analysis of these samples has been confounded by formalin-induced protein cross-linking. The performance of extracted proteins in a liquid chromatography tandem MS format from FFPE samples and extracts from whole and laser capture microdissected (LCM) FFPE and frozen/optimal cutting temperature (OCT)-embedded matched control rat liver samples were compared. Extracts from FFPE and frozen/OCT-embedded livers from atorvastatin-treated rats were further compared to assess the performance of FFPE samples in identifying atorvastatin-regulated proteins. Comparable molecular mass representation was found in extracts from FFPE and OCT-frozen tissue sections, whereas protein yields were slightly less for the FFPE sample. The numbers of shared proteins identified indicated that robust proteomic representation from FFPE tissue and LCM did not negatively affect the number of identified proteins from either OCT-frozen or FFPE samples. Subcellular representation in FFPE samples was similar to OCT-frozen, with predominantly cytoplasmic proteins identified. Biologically relevant protein changes were detected in atorvastatin-treated FFPE liver samples, and selected atorvastatin-related proteins identified by MS were confirmed by Western blot analysis. These findings demonstrate that formalin fixation, paraffin processing, and LCM do not negatively impact protein quality and quantity as determined by MS and that FFPE samples are amenable to global proteomic analysis.",

    "72": "Late graft failure of autologous vein grafts is associated with intimal hyperplasia resulting from the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is an enzyme that synthesizes nitric oxide (NO). An impairment of NO-mediated vasorelaxation and increases in cell proliferation occurs in vein grafts after the surgery and these pathophysiological changes cause intimal thickening. The Rho/Rho-kinase pathway negatively regulates eNOS and is involved in intimal hyperplasia. Several studies have been conducted with the goal of controlling intimal hyperplasia targeting eNOS/NO and the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway. The oral administration of drugs, such as Rho-kinase inhibitor, L: -arginine, beta-blocker and statins, significantly suppressed intimal thickening in animal models. This study revealed that statins upregulate eNOS through Rho-kinase inhibition to suppress intimal hyperplasia. The intraluminal gene transfer of eNOS inhibited intimal hyperplasia, thereby reducing the cell proliferation. These approaches are thus considered to be potentially promising therapeutic modalities for graft failure.",

Simvastatin was shown to increase the expression of Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2), which is one of the most potent growth factors targeting bone formation. In this study, the effect of simvastatin locally applied from a bioactive polymer coating of implants on fracture healing was investigated. A closed fracture of the right tibia of 5-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats was performed. Intramedullary stabilization was achieved with uncoated vs. polymer-only coated vs. polymer plus drug coated titanium Kirschner wires. Test substances (either simvastatin low- or high dosed or BMP-2) were incorporated into a biodegradable layer of poly(d,l-lactide). Tibiae were harvested after 28 or 42 days, respectively and underwent biomechanical testing (torsional stiffness and maximum load) and histomorphometric analysis. Radiographic results demonstrated progressed callus consolidation in the BMP-2- and simvastatin-treated groups compared to the uncoated group at both timepoints. The simvastatin-high-dosed group revealed an increased torsional stiffness and significantly elevated maximum load (d 28) compared to control group as well as a significant increase in both parameters at d 42. BMP-2-treated animals showed significantly elevated maximum load and stiffness at the early timepoint and elevated torsional stiffness after d 42. The histomorphometric analysis revealed a significantly decreased cartilage area for BMP-2 treated animals at d 28. Even though an increase of mineralized areas among periosteal callus was found at d 42 for simvastatin-high as well as BMP-2 treated animals, no significant difference could be detected at both timepoints compared to the uncoated group. However, simvastatin-high treated animals revealed significantly reduced cartilage areas within the periosteal callus at d 42. The present study revealed a dose-dependent effect and improved fracture healing under local application of simvastatin. Biomechanical, radiographic and histomorphometric properties showed comparable results to BMP-2- treated animals in this study.",

In the present study, we determined if the mevalonate derived compounds FPP and GGPP are increased in brain grey and white matter of male AD patients as compared with control samples. This study demonstrates for the first time that FPP and GGPP levels are significantly elevated in human AD grey and white matter but not cholesterol, indicating a potentially disease-specific targeting of isoprenoid regulation independent of HMG-CoA-reductase. Further suggesting a selective disruption of FPP and GGPP homeostasis in AD, we show that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in vivo significantly reduced FPP, GGPP and cholesterol abundance in mice with the largest effect on the isoprenoids. A tentative conclusion is that if indeed regulation of FPP and GGPP is altered in AD brain such changes may stimulate protein prenylation and contribute to AD neuropathophysiology.",

Mycotoxins of Fusarium fungi include the trichothecenes, deoxynivalenol and T-2 toxin (T2), and zearalenone, and have been implicated in poor reproductive performance in pigs. However, direct ovarian effects of T2 toxin have not been reported. Therefore, porcine granulosa cells (GC) from small follicles (1-5mm) were cultured for 2 days in 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% porcine serum-containing medium followed by 2 days in serum-free medium containing various doses of FSH, insulin-like growth factor-I and T2 (at various doses/combinations) to evaluate the influence of T2 on steroid production and cell proliferation. T2 at 1, 3, 30 and 300 ng/mL completely inhibited FSH plus IGF-I-induced estradiol production, whereas 0.3 ng/mL of T2 inhibited estradiol production by 40%. Progesterone production was less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of T2 with 0.3 ng/mL having no effect and 1 ng/mL inhibiting progesterone production by only 30%. At 30 and 300 ng/mL, T2 completely inhibited FSH plus IGF-I-induced progesterone production. The impact of T2 on the dose-response to IGF-I (0, 3, 10 and 30 ng/mL) was also evaluated; T2 blunted the stimulatory effect of 3-30 ng/mL of IGF-I on steroid production and cell proliferation. Serum-induced granulosa cell proliferation was decreased (P<0.05) by 40% after 1 day and by 56% after 2 days of T2 treatment. The present studies indicate for the first time that T2 may be able to alter in growth of the granulosa layer within ovarian follicles in addition to their effect on steroidogenesis. In conclusion, T2 has potent direct dose-dependent effects on granulosa cell proliferation and steroidogenesis. These direct ovarian effects could be one mechanism whereby contaminating Fusarium mycotoxins in feedstuffs could impact reproductive performance in swine.",

There was no statistically significant positive dynamics of EDVD in groups A and C. Results of the presented work show that for achievement of statistically significant positive vascular effect it is necessary to titrate dose of atorvastatin until target level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (< 2.5 mmol/l) is achieved. Vascular effect of therapy with atorvastatin in a fixed dose 10 mg/day is inferior to that of aggressive therapy, however it is substantially superior to common treatment.",

Five-week-old Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats, a model of metabolic syndrome, were untreated or treated with olmesartan 3 mg kg(-1) per day, pravastatin 30 mg kg(-1) per day or their combination for 25 weeks. Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka rats served as normal controls. The antihypertensive effect of olmesartan and the lipid-lowering properties of pravastatin were both augmented by the combination. The oral glucose tolerance test revealed that only the combined treatment significantly reduced the area under the time-glucose curve, which was accompanied by augmented adiponectin messenger RNA expression in epididymal adipose tissue. Although the total cardiac endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS) content did not significantly differ among the groups, the combined treatment significantly increased the content of dihydrofolate reductase, a key eNOS coupler. Dihydroethidium staining of the aorta showed that the combination most significantly attenuated superoxide production. Moreover, Azan-Mallory staining revealed that the combination most significantly limited the perivascular fibrosis and wall thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries. In conclusion, the combination of olmesartan and pravastatin augmented adiponectin expression in white adipose tissue and improved glucose tolerance in a rat model of metabolic syndrome, which was associated with more significant ameliorations of cardiovascular redox state and remodeling than those by treatments with either agent alone.",

Statin use significantly reduces risk of cardiovascular disease but has also been associated with lower risk of other diseases and conditions, including dementia. However, some reports suggest that statins also have detrimental effects on the brain. We provide evidence that simvastatin and pravastatin have significantly different effects on expression of genes related to neurodegeneration in astrocytes and neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) cells in culture. Simvastatin significantly reduced expression of ABCA1 in astrocytes and neuroblastoma cells (by 79% and 97%, respectively; both P < 0.001). Pravastatin had a similar but attenuated effect on ABCA1 in astrocytes (-54%, P < 0.001) and neuroblastoma cells (-70%, P < 0.001). Simvastatin reduced expression of apolipoprotein E in astrocytes (P < 0.01). Furthermore, both statins reduced expression of microtubule-associated protein tau in astrocytes (P < 0.01), while both statins increased its expression in neuroblastoma cells (P < 0.01). In SK-N-SH cells, simvastatin significantly increased cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta expression, while pravastatin increased amyloid precursor protein expression. Our data suggest that simvastatin and pravastatin differentially affect expression of genes involved in neurodegeneration and that statin-dependent gene expression regulation is cell type specific.",

Our results show that all metabolites induced lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances increase) and decreased glutathione levels in striatum, whereas 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate, besides inducing the strongest effect, also altered thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and glutathione levels in the liver. Furthermore, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate, 3-methylglutarate and 3-methylglutaconate oxidized sulfhydryl groups in the striatum, but not in the liver. Our data indicate that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate behaves as a stronger pro-oxidant agent compared to the other metabolites accumulating in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria and that the striatum present higher vulnerability to oxidative damage relatively to the liver.",

TAC group immunosuppression consisted of basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and steroid. EVL group immunosuppression consisted of basiliximab, everolimus, and low doses of cyclosporine and steroid. Main CVR factors analyzed were: hypertension, dyslipidemia, posttransplant diabetes mellitus, and weight gain.",

Mean systolic blood pressure, mean diastolic blood pressure, number of patients treated for hypertension, number of antihypertensive medications prescribed per patient, posttransplant weight gain, and posttransplant diabetes mellitus were not significantly different among the EVL and TAC groups after 1, 3, and 6 months posttransplantation.", 
    "111": "This study showed that at 6 months posttransplantation, patients on EVL displayed significantly greater dyslipidemia with respect to the TAC group.

    "112": "Interventions to attenuate abnormal glycemia posttransplantation are required. In addition, surrogate markers of declining glycemic control are valuable. Statins may have pleiotropic properties that attenuate abnormal glucose metabolism. We hypothesized statins would improve glucose metabolism and HbA1c would be advantageous as a surrogate for worsening glycemia. We conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover study in 20 nondiabetic renal transplant recipients at low risk for NODAT and compared effects of rosuvastatin on insulin secretion/sensitivity. Mathematical model analysis of an intravenous glucose tolerance test determined first-phase insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and disposition index. Second-phase insulin secretion was determined with a meal tolerance test. Biochemical/clinical parameters were also assessed. Rosuvastatin significantly improved total cholesterol (-30%, p < 0.001), LDL cholesterol (-44%, p < 0.001) and triglycerides (-19%, p = 0.013). C-reactive protein decreased but failed to achieve statistical significance (-31%, p = 0.097). Rosuvastatin failed to influence any glycemic physiological parameter, although an inadequate timeframe to allow pleiotropic mechanisms to clinically manifest raises the possibility of a type II statistical error. On multivariate analysis, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) correlated with disposition index (R(2)= 0.201, p = 0.006), first-phase insulin secretion (R(2)= 0.106, p = 0.049) and insulin sensitivity (R(2)= 0.136, p = 0.029). Rosuvastatin fails to modify glucose metabolism in low-risk patients posttransplantation but HbA1c is a useful surrogate for declining glycemic control.",

While alloimmunity has a definite role, there is increasing interest in overall allograft injury and subsequent inflammation and remodeling. This review deals with nonalloimmune factors that may potentiate alloimmune injury. We discuss infection and reflux/aspiration as examples of allograft injury, which may lead to chronic loss of graft function and BOS. Surgical and nonsurgical treatments aimed at preventing these insults and improving survival are considered. The need for further evidence, including randomized-controlled trials, to evaluate the role of medical and surgical therapies is emphasized by the current literature.", 
    "114": "Recently, two randomized controlled phase II studies showed that acute initiation of statin treatment directly after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) decreases the incidence of radiologic vasospasm and clinical signs of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), and even reduces mortality. It was hypothesized that the beneficial effect resulted from pleiotropic effects of statins. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biologic effects of acute statin treatment in patients with SAH. We performed an exploratory single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized to simvastatin 80 mg or placebo once daily. A total of 32 patients were included. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical baseline characteristics. With regard to primary outcomes, there were significant differences by treatment group for total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P<0.0001), but not for parameters of coagulation, fibrinolysis, endothelium function, and inflammation. With regard to secondary outcomes, no differences were observed in the incidence of transcranial Doppler vasospasm, clinical signs of DCI, and poor outcome. We conclude that both the primary and secondary outcome results of this study do not support a beneficial effect of simvastatin in patients with SAH.", 
    "115": "Recent animal and human studies have shown that plant sterols and stanols, which are used as functional food ingredients to lower increased LDL cholesterol concentrations, pass the blood-brain barrier. Whether this affects neurocognitive functioning and mental well-being in humans has, to our knowledge, never been investigated. The aim of the present study was therefore to examine the effects of long-term plant sterol or stanol consumption on neurocognitive functioning and mood in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary intervention trial. To this end, hypercholesterolemic individuals, aged 43-69 y, receiving stable statin treatment were randomly assigned to an 85-wk supplementation with margarines enriched with plant sterol esters (2.5 g/d), plant stanol esters (2.5 g/d), or placebo. At baseline and at the end of the intervention period, all participants underwent a cognitive assessment. In addition, subjective cognitive functioning and mood were assessed by means of questionnaires (Cognitive Failure Questionnaire and depression subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90, respectively). Long-term supplementation with plant sterol or stanol esters did not affect cognitive performance (memory, simple information processing speed, complex information processing speed, Letter-Digit Substitution test performance), subjective cognitive functioning, or mood. In conclusion, the present results indicate that long-term use of plant sterols or stanols at recommended intakes of 2.5 g/d does not affect neurocognitive functioning or mood in hypercholesterolemic individuals receiving statin treatment.", 
    "116": "In addition to cholesterol-lowering properties, statins exhibit lipid-independent immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory actions. However, high concentrations are typically required to induce these effects in vitro, raising questions concerning therapeutic relevance. We present evidence that endothelial cell sensitivity to statins depends upon shear stress. Using heme oxygenase-1 expression as a model, we demonstrate differential heme oxygenase-1 induction by atorvastatin in atheroresistant compared with atheroprone sites of the murine aorta. In vitro, exposure of human endothelial cells to laminar shear stress significantly reduced the statin concentration required to induce heme oxygenase-1 and protect against H(2)O(2)-mediated injury. Synergy was observed between laminar shear stress and atorvastatin, resulting in optimal expression of heme oxygenase-1 and resistance to oxidative stress, a response inhibited by heme oxygenase-1 small interfering RNA. Moreover, treatment of laminar shear stress-exposed endothelial cells resulted in a significant fall in intracellular cholesterol. Mechanistically, synergy required Akt phosphorylation, activation of Kruppel-like factor 2, NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), increased nitric-oxide synthase activity, and enhanced HO-1 mRNA stability. In contrast, heme oxygenase-1 induction by atorvastatin in endothelial cells exposed to oscillatory flow was markedly attenuated. We have identified a novel relationship between laminar shear stress and statins, demonstrating that atorvastatin-mediated heme oxygenase-1-dependent antioxidant effects are laminar shear stress-dependent, proving the principle that biomechanical signaling contributes significantly to endothelial responsiveness to pharmacological agents. Our findings suggest statin pleiotropy may be suboptimal at disturbed flow atherosusceptible sites, emphasizing the need for more specific therapeutic agents, such as those targeting Kruppel-like factor 2 or Nrf2.", 
    "117": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), characterized by extracellular beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) deposits in vessel walls, is present in the majority of cases of Alzheimer's disease and is a major cause of hemorrhagic stroke. Although the molecular pathways activated by vascular Abeta are poorly understood, extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and Abeta-induced oxidative stress appear to play important roles. We adapted fluorogenic assays for MMP activity and reactive oxygen species generation for use in vivo. Using multiphoton microscopy in APPswe/PS1dE9 and Tg-2576 transgenic mice, we observed strong associations between MMP activation, oxidative stress, and CAA deposition in leptomeningeal vessels. Antioxidant treatment with alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl-nitrone reduced oxidative stress associated with CAA (approximately 50% reduction) without affecting MMP activation. Conversely, a selection of agents that inhibit MMP by different mechanisms of action, including minocycline, simvastatin, and GM6001, reduced not only CAA-associated MMP activation (approximately 30-40% reduction) but also oxidative stress (approximately 40% reduction). The inhibitors of MMP did not have direct antioxidant effects. Treatment of animals with alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butyl-nitrone or minocycline did not have a significant effect on CAA progression rates. These data suggest a close association between Abeta-related MMP activation and oxidative stress in vivo and raise the possibility that treatment with MMP inhibitors may have beneficial effects by indirectly reducing the oxidative stress associated with CAA.",

We conducted a case-control study using the electronic medical records at Michigan State University from 2002 to 2007 to assess whether statin use is a risk factor for tendon rupture. We compared exposure to statins in 93 cases of tendon rupture with similar exposure in 279 sex- and age-matched controls. Exposure to statins was defined as documentation in the electronic medical record of statin use in the 12 months preceding tendon rupture. For controls, the exposure period was defined as 1 year preceding the last office visit. We used a multivariate logistic regression model, controlling for diabetes, renal disease, rheumatologic disease, and steroid use, to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (ORs). There was no significant difference between cases and controls in the rates of statin use, with either univariate [OR = 1.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-1.84] or multivariate analyses (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.57-2.13).

    "125": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common degenerative condition with high mortality in older men. Elective surgical or endovascular repair is performed to prevent rupture of large AAAs. In contrast, despite gradual expansion, small AAAs have a low risk of rupture, and there is currently no well-defined treatment strategy for them. Therefore, a pharmacological approach for AAA is expected in the clinical setting. Indeed, several therapeutic effects of pharmacological agents have been reported in experimental models, and some agents have undergone clinical trials. Treatment with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory agents appears to inhibit the growth rate of AAA in humans. However, as the sample size and follow-up period were limited in these studies, a large randomized study with long-term follow-up of small AAA should be performed to clarify the effect of these agents. Recently, the regression of AAA using molecular pharmacological approaches was reported in experimental studies. The characteristics of these strategies are the regulation of multiple molecular mediators and the signalling networks associated with AAA formation. On the basis of the results of these investigations, it may be possible to repair the injured aortic wall and obtain the remission of AAA using pharmacological therapy.",

    "137": "Hypercholesterolemia is a growing health concern in the United States. Pharmacotherapy is increasingly being used to combat the long-term consequences of elevated cholesterol levels. One of the primary pharmacological treatments for hypercholesterolemia is a class of lipid lowering drugs collectively referred to as statins. After introduction of the first statin in 1987, their use quickly became the norm. Recent release of the results from the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study unveiled a potential increased risk of cancer and cancer death for individuals taking the well-known drug combination of ezetimibe/simvastatin. Our aim with this review is to look at previous studies to see if any other studies have shown a similar correlation between statins or other lipid-lowering drugs and cancer. The associated studies gathered are reviews, randomized, controlled trials, editorials, and commentaries. We obtained these studies by using electronic searches such as PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane Library. Searches were limited in that certain keywords took precedence, and articles mainly focusing on statins and ezetimibe as opposed to other lipid-lowering drugs were chosen. We have shown that aside from the SEAS study, there are numerous other studies that have also found potential links between statins and various forms of cancer. However, there is also an abundance of literature showing the contrary. Currently, scientific data are slightly in favor of the notion that statins do not cause a significant increase in cancer rates. However, there are many studies that show small correlations between statin use and increased incidence of cancer and therefore, we feel further prospective studies are needed. Whether statins do cause cancer remains uncertain at this point in time.", 
    "138": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) modulates vasomotor tone, cell growth, and extracellular matrix deposition. This study analyzed the effect of atorvastatin in the possible alterations induced by Ang II on structure and mechanics of mesenteric resistance arteries and the signaling mechanisms involved. Wistar rats were infused with Ang II (100 ng/kg per day, SC minipumps, 2 weeks) with or without atorvastatin (5 mg/kg per day). Ang II increased blood pressure and plasmatic malondialdehyde levels. Compared with controls, mesenteric resistance arteries from Ang II-treated rats showed the following: (1) decreased lumen diameter; (2) increased wall/lumen; (3) decreased number of adventitial, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells; (4) increased stiffness; (5) increased collagen deposition; and (6) diminished fenestrae area and number in the internal elastic lamina. Atorvastatin did not alter blood pressure but reversed all of the structural and mechanical alterations of mesenteric arteries, including collagen and elastin alterations. In mesenteric resistance arteries, Ang II increased vascular O(2)(.-) production and diminished endothelial NO synthase and CuZn/superoxide dismutase but did not modify extracellular-superoxide dismutase expression. Atorvastatin improved plasmatic and vascular oxidative stress, normalized endothelial NO synthase and CuZn/superoxide dismutase expression, and increased extracellular-superoxide dismutase expression, showing antioxidant properties. Atorvastatin also diminished extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation caused by Ang II in these vessels, indicating an interaction with Ang II-induced intracellular responses. In vascular smooth muscle cells, collagen type I release mediated by Ang II was reduced by different antioxidants and statins. Moreover, atorvastatin downregulated the Ang II-induced NADPH oxidase subunit, Nox1, expression. Our results suggest that statins might exert beneficial effects on hypertension-induced vascular remodeling by improving vascular structure, extracellular matrix alterations, and vascular stiffness. These effects might be mediated by their antioxidant properties.",

A recent meta-analysis has confirmed benefit on major coronary events and ischaemic stroke in many diabetic patient subgroups, including those with type 1 disease. The pathological combination of several lipoprotein metabolism abnormalities and the need to reach lipoprotein goals need combination therapy of hypolipidemic drugs with different mechanisms of action.

Although there has been disappointment with the first cholesteryl-ester-transfer-protein-inhibitor, there is encouraging evidence that increasing HDL with the peroxisome-proliferator-activator-receptor (PPAR) gamma agonist, pioglitazone and nicotinic acid derivatives may contribute beyond statin therapy.",

Simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, further down-regulated cav1 protein, whereas repleting cells with cholesterol increased cav1 protein and enhanced the anti-growth effect of simvastatin.

Most fatal thromboses, which may manifest as acute myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, result from frank rupture or superficial erosion of the fibrous cap overlying the atheroma, processes that occur in inflammatorily active, rupture-prone plaques. Appreciation of the inflammatory character of atherosclerosis has led to the application of C-reactive protein as a biomarker of cardiovascular risk and the characterization of the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions of the statin class of drugs. An improved understanding of the pathobiology of atherosclerosis and further studies of its immune mechanisms provide avenues for the development of future strategies directed toward better risk stratification of patients as well as the identification of novel anti-inflammatory therapies.

Thus, the method may be less sensitive for the detection of slight differences among the experimental groups, unless a more suitable procedure employing physical fixation with histological sample freezing using optimal cutting temperature and liquid nitrogen is employed. Thus, when measuring experimental atherosclerosis in mice, investigators should be aware of several previously unreported pitfalls regarding the extent, location and complexity of the arterial lesion that may not be suitable for extrapolation to human pathology.", 
    "152": "This review is a summary of the New Zealand guideline for the management of Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA). TIA is a medical emergency and warrants urgent attention. The risk of early stroke following TIA may be as high as 12% at 7 days, and 20% at 90 days, with half of these strokes occurring within the first 48 hours. All people with suspected TIA should be assessed at initial point of health care contact for their risk of stroke. Diagnosis of TIA is more likely to be correct if the history confirms: sudden onset of symptoms, with maximal neurological deficit at onset; symptoms typical of focal loss of brain function such as unilateral weakness or speech disturbance; and rapid recovery, usually within 30-60 minutes. The ABCD2 score is a tool that assists with diagnosis and identifies people most at risk of stroke after TIA. People at high risk of stroke require urgent specialist assessment as soon as possible but definitely within 24 hours. This includes those with ABCD2 scores of 4 or more, crescendo TIAs, atrial fibrillation, or who are taking anticoagulants. People at low risk usually require specialist assessment and investigations within 7 days. This includes those with ABCD2 scores of less than 4 or those who present more than one week after TIA symptoms. As soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, all people with TIA should have their risk factors addressed and be established on an appropriate individual combination of secondary prevention measures including anti-platelet agents, blood pressure-lowering therapy, statin, warfarin (if atrial fibrillation or other cardiac source of emboli), and nicotine replacement therapy or other smoking cessation aid. Urgent assessment and intervention in TIA clinics has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke after TIA by up to 80%. Follow-up, either in primary or secondary care, should occur within 1 month so that medication and other risk factor modification can be reassessed.",

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a subset of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease manifested by hepatic fatty infiltration and inflammation which may progress to cirrhosis and its subsequent complications, to include hepatocellular carcinoma. As the metabolic syndrome is thought to be central in the pathogenesis of NASH, it has been speculated that medications that improve metabolic profiles may be beneficial in treatment.

The average particle size of AC obviously increased from 410 nm to 1200 nm as the stirring time changed from 30s to 60 min. The enhancement of drug concentration favored to decrease the particle size from 410 nm to 240 nm. After spray drying process, ultrafine AC powder was obtained, which had good dispersibility and narrow particle size distribution of 1-3 microm. The as-prepared ultrafine AC was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), specific surface area and dissolution test.

Patients with uncontrolled lipid levels who were not following guideline recommendations were assumed to be receiving combination treatment (ie, coadministration of statin and fibrate) or monotherapy for the uncontrolled lipids under guideline care. Results from a previous study were used to project incremental benefits of combination treatment compared with monotherapy. CHD events were predicted based on risk equations.

Total present value of costs for drug treatment and medical care for CHD events would be $33,626 per patient for guideline treatment versus $25,264 per patient for current care. The discounted QALY gain would be 0.18 per patient for an incremental cost per QALY of $50,315.",

    "172": "Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs widely prescribed for cardiovascular prevention. They are also immunomodulatory and increase peripheral regulatory T cell numbers and function, in vivo. This may be beneficial by decreasing inflammatory response within the atheroma and stabilizing atherosclerotic plaque, however this novel pleiotropic effect might impair host tumor-specific effector T cell responses. Indeed, in some randomized trials, notwithstanding their short duration, statins have been found to increase cancer incidence especially in the elderly and women. In these situations, the decrease in cardiovascular mortality can be matched by an equal increase in cancer mortality, leaving all-cause mortality unchanged. Furthermore, statins have been shown to interfere with cancer immunotherapy. Preventive pharmacological treatment can sometimes be justified because of reduced cardiovascular events even if total mortality does not change, but if it leads to an increase in cancer incidence, it might be not easily accepted. Physicians need to weigh the global risks and benefits when prescribing statins.", 
    "173": "LDL cholesterol is the primary target of treatment for lowering the risk of cardiovascular events in both primary and secondary prevention. The usual drug to achieve this goal is HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which constitute the most potent and effective class to reduce LDL cholesterol. Statins have been shown to be associated with good patient compliance, lower adverse events, and few drug interactions. Clinical trials have demonstrated that statin therapy reduces all clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. These trials have also shown that the amount of risk reduction achieved is closely related to the degree of adherence to treatment. Despite evidence for the benefits of LDL-lowering with statins, initiation of treatment, achievement of the goals, and long-term adherence to therapy remain far from optimal. However, in order to achieve maximum benefit from statin therapy as seen in clinical trials, it is important that patients receive optimal-dose therapy for the rest of their lives. This review is concerned with a combination of patient-, physician-, and health delivery system-focused interventions, as outlined by the ATP III guidelines to improve adherence in clinical practice.", 
    "174": "During the 10 years of atorvastatin availability in the Turkish market, the physicians have had the opportunity to observe the accumulation of data related to its beneficial effect on clinical endpoints. The scope of this review is limited to the trials concerning the role of atorvastatin in secondary prevention. In GREACE and ALLIANCE studies, the benefit of atorvastatin was demonstrated in patients with coronary heart disease in real-world setting. TNT was the first trial which showed that aggressive lipid lowering therapy was more protective than a moderate one in patients with stable coronary artery disease. In the MIRACL trial, 80 mg atorvastatin was compared with placebo and found effective in preventing ischemic events in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes. PROVE-IT proved that aggressive lipid lowering therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg was much more effective than moderate therapy (pravastatin 40 mg) in patients with all types of acute coronary syndromes. AVERT was the first statin trial to show that aggressive therapy with atorvastatin was at least as effective as angioplasty in patients with stable coronary artery disease. The SPARCL trial demonstrated the efficacy of atorvastatin in secondary prevention of patients with stroke.", 
    "175": "Statins are one of the most widely used drugs in medical treatment and have been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease or reduce risk in a large number of studies. Although there is a general class effect, there are differences with regard to structure and efficacy between these agents. Among these agents, atorvastatin is a potent statin whose efficacy has been demonstrated in many clinical trials. Despite the presence of numerous clinical studies, data on atorvastatin related to primary prevention are limited compared to secondary prevention. In this article, clinical results of primary prevention trials with atorvastatin and data on its cost-effectiveness are reviewed. It is concluded that atorvastatin has a role in primary prevention and the cost of its use seems to be lower than commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds.", 
    "176": "Atherosclerotic vascular disease is characterized by inflammation and lipid accumulation resulting from detrimental effects of several risk factors on vascular structure, including dyslipidemia. The disease progresses slowly and insidiously resulting in acute coronary syndromes when the plaque ruptures. The plaques having a high propensity to rupture are defined as vulnerable. The vulnerability of the plaque is determined by several factors such as its lipid content, degree of inflammation, strength of the fibrous cap, degree of apoptosis, necrosis, and neovascularization. The patient's risk profile and characteristics are also related to the vulnerability of plaques. The main aim in preventive cardiology is to prevent the formation of atherosclerotic plaques or to stabilize the existing plaques to decrease cardiovascular events. Lifestyle modifications, reduction in risk factors, and some pharmacologic measures can improve plaque stabilization. Statins contribute to plaque stabilization by their lipid lowering and pleiotropic effects. Several studies have shown that, with statin treatment, the plaque becomes more stable, resulting in a decrease in cardiovascular events. This review summarizes the studies about plaque-stabilizing effects of atorvastatin.",

    "181": "Abundant evidence from large-scale clinical trials supports the importance of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. The LDL-C targets in various guidelines remain important treatment goals but, even in trials where statin therapy achieves substantial reduction of LDL-C, a significant number of CVD events still occur and the residual risk remains high. These findings suggest that lipid parameters other than LDL-C, such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, and LDL particle size, can influence the risk of CVD. On this basis, other strategies that can alter the lipid profile, in particular raising HDL.C, may provide additional benefits. Other factors such as HDL-C functionality and susceptibility to oxidation and inflammatory factors can also influence cardiovascular risk. In addition to the modifications of the lipid profile, statins have cholesterol-independent beneficial pleiotropic effects. The contribution of these effects to event reduction is not yet fully understood. Recently, the body of evidence has expanded to support the use of intensive statin therapy in broader patient populations. The JUPITER trial has shown the benefit of intensive statin treatment in low-risk subjects with high levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and average levels of LDL-C. Unlike the setting of primary and secondary prevention, the results of statin trials in patients with heart failure have shown no clear benefit in terms of survival. The recently published AURORA trial was carried out to investigate the effect of rosuvastatin in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis. In this trial no benefit on cardiovascular events was shown with statin therapy. In conclusion, large outcomes trials have clearly shown that statin treatments have a favorable benefit/risk profile in a large range of patients at different levels of risk, with the exception of patients with heart failure and those with renal disease undergoing dialysis. Further evidence is needed on the role of therapeutic strategies on the so-called residual risk.", 
    "182": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulates serum LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) by interacting with the LDL receptor (LDLR) and is an attractive therapeutic target for LDL-C lowering. We have generated a neutralizing anti-PCSK9 antibody, mAb1, that binds to an epitope on PCSK9 adjacent to the region required for LDLR interaction. In vitro, mAb1 inhibits PCSK9 binding to the LDLR and attenuates PCSK9-mediated reduction in LDLR protein levels, thereby increasing LDL uptake. A combination of mAb1 with a statin increases LDLR levels in HepG2 cells more than either treatment alone. In wild-type mice, mAb1 increases hepatic LDLR protein levels approximately 2-fold and lowers total serum cholesterol by up to 36%: this effect is not observed in LDLR(-/-) mice. In cynomolgus monkeys, a single injection of mAb1 reduces serum LDL-C by 80%, and a significant decrease is maintained for 10 days. We conclude that anti-PCSK9 antibodies may be effective therapeutics for treating hypercholesterolemia.",

If the therapeutic goals were not attained (<100 mg/dL of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] for type C and <70 mg for type D), patients in group 1 received pravastatin 40 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg, group 2 received simvastatin 80 mg, and group 3 received simvastatin 40 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg. The primary endpoint was the change of IMT over the course of 1 year. The secondary endpoints were changes in LDL-C and in high sensitive C-reactive protein (CRPhs). The overall baseline IMTs generated by combining measurements in the internal carotid artery were 1.33+/-0.32 mm, 1.30+/-0.11 mm, and 1.23+/-0.28 mm for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

This last effect represents one of the most important targets of lipid-lowering drugs, in particular, carotid intima-media thickness, and an early-onset of atherosclerotic process. The acute anti-inflammatory effects of statins should further be explored as a potential mediator of change in intima-media thickness.

It has concurrently been explained that variations in the drug transporter genes are associated with not only inter-individual but also inter-ethnic differences in PK/PD profiles of these drugs. This review focuses on two uptake and two efflux transporters. Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3 are uptake transporters, specifically expressed in the liver, and considered important for drugs, particularly as their pharmacological target organ is the liver. Two ATP-binding cassette transporters, multi-drug resistance-associated protein 2 and breast cancer resistance protein, are efflux transporters, expressed in various human tissues, and considered particularly important for intestinal drug absorption and hepatic drug elimination. All 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) except fluvastatin are substrates for OATP1B1, but hepatobiliary (canalicular) efflux transporters differ among statins. In this review, we update the pharmacogenomic/pharmacogenetic properties of these transporters and their effects on PK/PD profiles of statins and other clinically relevant drugs. In addition, we describe a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for predicting the effects of changes in transporter activities on systemic and hepatic exposure to pravastatin."
