This study investigated whether the CD40 system is upregulated in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia and whether it is influenced by therapy with a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor.", 
    "1": "Fifteen patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia and 15 healthy control subjects were investigated. CD154 and P-selectin were analyzed on platelets and CD40 was analyzed on monocytes before and under therapy with the statin cerivastatin by double-label flow cytometry. Blood concentrations of soluble CD154 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were evaluated. Our main findings were as follows. Patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia showed a significant increase of CD154 and P-selectin on platelets and CD40 on monocytes compared with healthy subjects. Soluble CD154 showed a nonsignificant trend for higher plasma levels in patients. A positive correlation was found for total or LDL cholesterol and CD154, but not for CD40 on monocytes. The latter was upregulated in vitro by C-reactive protein, which was found to be significantly elevated in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. CD154 on platelets proved to be biologically active because it enhanced the release of MCP-1, which was markedly elevated in an in vitro platelet-endothelial cell coculture model and in the serum of patients. Short-term therapy with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor significantly downregulated CD40 on monocytes and serum levels of MCP-1.",

    "3": "Three-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce coronary events and death in both primary and secondary prevention trials. In these trials benefit did not appear for years after randomization. It is noteworthy that these trials did not include patients with recent myocardial infarctions or unstable angina. It is well known that mortality and recurrent ischemic events rates are the highest in the early period after acute coronary syndromes. Favorable physiologic effects of statins have been described within a few weeks of exposure to the statin in a number of experimental studies. The Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) study was designed to bridge the gap between primary and secondary prevention trials and specifically included patients with unstable angina or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.", 
    "4": "Coronary flow reserve is mainly influenced by the combination of luminal stenosis and vascular dilation capacity. Thus, after statin treatment, the reduction of ischemic threshold in patients submitted to exercise testing could be intensely influenced by angiographic severity. In this study, we verify the effect of statin treatment on exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in hypercholesterolemic patients with a broad range of coronary angiographic severities. Patients with 2 consecutive positive exercise tests, coronary stenosis > or =70%, total cholesterol > or =300 mg/dl, and triglycerides < or =200 mg/dl were randomly assigned to a 16-week treatment period with either diet alone (n = 39) or diet plus statins (simavastatin, n = 31 and pravastatin, n = 10). Statin-treated patients had a significant variation in total cholesterol (-46% vs -2.7%; p <0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-58% vs 0.8%; p <0.01), and high-density cholesterol (+28% vs -6%; p <0.05) in comparison with the diet-only group. After 16 weeks of treatment, 36 patients (92%) in the diet group still had positive exercise tests, whereas only 7 patients (15%) of the statin group had a positive test (p <0.01). The proportion of positive tests was significantly reduced in subgroups of patients with 1-, 2-, or 3-vessel disease. Regarding the severity of coronary stenosis, the proportion of positive tests was significantly reduced in patients with stenosis between 70% and 90% and in patients with stenosis > or =90%. Moreover, the proportion of positive tests tended to decrease to a greater extent in patients with mild coronary disease. In conclusion, cholesterol-lowering treatment with statins reduces exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in hypercholesterolemic patients with mild or severe epicardial coronary stenosis.", 
    "5": "Pravastatin has been shown, in an experimental model of ischemia reperfusion, to increase adenosine levels, which exert a potent and protective effect on the heart. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether pravastatin can provide cardioprotection by increased production of adenosine in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty, a clinical model of ischemia reperfusion. Thirty-five hyperlipidemic patients who underwent elective angioplasty for a major epicardial coronary artery were randomly allocated to either 3-month pravastatin or placebo before catheterization. In the placebo group, the mean ST-segment shift during the second balloon inflation was similar that observed during the first inflation, whereas in the preconditioned patients, the shift was significantly less, which is consistent with ischemic preconditioning. In the pravastatin-treated patients, the changes of ST-segment shift were similar between the first and second balloon inflations. In contrast, the patients who received aminophylline developed higher ST-segment shifts during the first and second inflations than those in the pravastatin-treated group alone. Measurements of chest pain score and myocardial lactate extraction ratios during inflation mirrored those of the ST-segment shift. The present study demonstrates that administration of pravastatin results in a significant gain in tolerance to ischemia during angioplasty. The effect of pravastatin was abolished by aminophylline, suggesting that the cardioprotective effect of pravastatin may result from activation of adenosine receptors.", 
    "6": "Statin therapy has been reported to reduce the acute rejection rate following renal transplantation in a pilot study. The present study is the first randomized, double-blind and adequately powered study to examine the effect of statins on acute rejection of renal allografts.", 
    "7": "A total of 364 patients were randomly assigned to receive either fluvastatin 40 mg or placebo in combination with conventional cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive therapy. The primary end point was treated first acute rejection. Secondary end points included biopsy-proven rejection, histological severity of rejection, occurrence of steroid-resistant rejection, and serum creatinine at three months following transplantation.", 
    "8": "Fluvastatin was well tolerated; no patients developed myositis or rhabdomyolysis. There was no difference in the acute rejection rate [86 (47.3%) fluvastatin vs. 87 (47.8%) placebo] and no significant difference in the severity of rejection, steroid resistant rejection or mean serum creatinine at three months (160 micromol/L vs. 160 micromol/L). Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased following renal transplantation. With the exception of the increase in HDL-C, which was augmented, the increases in lipid parameters were significantly reduced by fluvastatin (total cholesterol +17.5% vs. 35.7%; LDL-C +6.3% vs. 46.7%; HDL-C +43.3% vs. 38.1%; triglyceride +52.2% vs 77.6%).", 
    "9": "Contrary to the reported effects of statins, fluvastatin had no effect on the incidence or severity of acute rejection following renal transplantation. There were no increases in adverse events. A significant and potentially beneficial alteration in the lipid profile was observed in the early post transplant period. We conclude that fluvastatin may be used safely to correct dyslipidemia in patients with end-stage renal failure through the peri-transplant period.", 
    "10": "Striking parallels exist in both risk and protective factors between coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with insulin resistance are more likely to develop diabetes and coronary heart disease. Better treatment of diabetes may result in less coronary heart disease, although this has not yet been established. Reliance on fasting glucose determinations alone will overlook a substantial number of patients at risk for diabetes and subsequent coronary heart disease. Measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin should be a routine part of screening for patients at risk for diabetes. Patients with glycosylated hemoglobin levels in the high-normal range should be treated more aggressively with diet, exercise, and medication because evidence is good that diabetes can be prevented (or its onset delayed). Patients with borderline elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and with high-normal glycosylated hemoglobin levels should be considered for statin therapy, and patients with hypertension with high-normal glycosylated hemoglobin levels should be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as first-line agents. Studies to determine whether metformin is useful in this population are ongoing.", 
    "11": "Treatment of hypercholesterolemia has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. Patients with severe lipid abnormalities may require high-dose statin therapy, at times used in combination with additional agents. We report a case of fatal rhabdomyolysis caused by the combination of simvastatin and gemfibrozil. Clinicians should be aware of risk factors for rhabdomyolysis, which include underlying renal insufficiency, high-dose statin therapy, and combination therapy with a fibrate.", 
    "12": "The molecular mechanisms controlling synaptogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) are poorly understood. Previous reports showed that a glia-derived factor strongly promotes synapse development in cultures of purified CNS neurons. Here, we identify this factor as cholesterol complexed to apolipoprotein E-containing lipoproteins. CNS neurons produce enough cholesterol to survive and grow, but the formation of numerous mature synapses demands additional amounts that must be provided by glia. Thus, the availability of cholesterol appears to limit synapse development. This may explain the delayed onset of CNS synaptogenesis after glia differentiation and neurobehavioral manifestations of defects in cholesterol or lipoprotein homeostasis.", 
    "13": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins exert direct beneficial effects on the endothelium in part through an increase in nitric oxide (NO) production. Here, we examined whether posttranslational modifications of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) could account for the proangiogenic effects of statins. We used endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from cardiac microvasculature, aorta, and umbilical veins, as well as dissected microvessels and aortic rings, that were cultured on reconstituted basement membrane matrix (Matrigel). Tube or precapillary formation was evaluated after statin treatment, in parallel with immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments. Atorvastatin stimulated NO-dependent angiogenesis from both isolated and outgrowing (vessel-derived) ECs, independently of changes in eNOS expression. We found that in macro- but not microvascular ECs, atorvastatin stabilized tube formation through a decrease in caveolin abundance and its inhibitory interaction with eNOS. We also identified the chaperone protein hsp90 as a key target for the proangiogenic effects of statins. Using geldanamycin, an inhibitor of hsp90 function, and overexpression of recombinant hsp90, we documented that the statin-induced phosphorylation of eNOS on Ser1177 was directly dependent on the ability of hsp90 to recruit Akt in the eNOS complex. Finally, we showed that statin promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of hsp90 and the direct interaction of hsp90 with Akt, which further potentiated the NO-dependent angiogenic processes. Our study provides new mechanistic insights into the NO-mediated angiogenic effects of statins and underscores the potential of these drugs and other modulators of hsp90 and caveolin abundance to promote neovascularization in disease states associated or not with atherosclerosis.", 
    "14": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. Several large clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of statins in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. However, the overall clinical benefits observed with statin therapy appear to be greater than what might be expected from changes in lipid profile alone, suggesting that the beneficial effects of statins may extend beyond their effects on serum cholesterol levels. Indeed, recent experimental and clinical evidence indicates that some of the cholesterol-independent or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins involve improving or restoring endothelial function, enhancing the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, and decreasing oxidative stress and vascular inflammation. Many of these pleiotropic effects of statins are mediated by their ability to block the synthesis of important isoprenoid intermediates, which serve as lipid attachments for a variety of intracellular signaling molecules. In particular, the inhibition of small GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Ras, and Rac, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation, may play an important role in mediating the direct cellular effects of statins on the vascular wall.", 
    "15": "RNA from various mouse organs was analyzed by Northern hybridization to determine the response of squalene synthase (SQS) mRNA to dietary cholesterol, or lovastatin and cholestyramine, administration. Two size-classes of highly abundant mouse SQS (mSQS) mRNAs of approximately 1.9 and 2.0 kb were found in testis. These transcripts were unresponsive to sterol regulation. A single size-class of liver mSQS mRNA of approximately 1.9 kb was sterol-regulated. Studies using primer extension and 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) indicated that the size differences in liver and testis mSQS transcripts were due to variations in the lengths of the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). The longest testis 5' UTR extended approximately 106 nt 5' of the primary transcription initiation site in liver of mice fed lovastatin and cholestyramine. These results suggest that tissue-specific promoter elements control the transcriptional regulation of the promoters for the mSQS gene in liver and testis.", 
    "16": "Binding of sterol response element binding protein 1a to sterol response element-1 (SRE-1) in the promoter region of lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (14DM) has been demonstrated previously. Decreased 14DM activity has been shown to result in accumulation of the intermediate, 3 beta-hydroxy-lanost-8-en-32-al, a known translational downregulator of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Since it has also been demonstrated that feedback regulation of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase occurs primarily at the level of translation, the effects of dietary cholesterol and cholesterol lowering agents on levels of hepatic 14DM mRNA and immunoreactive protein were investigated. Addition of 1% cholesterol to a chow diet markedly decreased hepatic 14DM mRNA and protein levels in Sprague-Dawley rats. The extent and time course of this decrease in 14DM immunoreactive protein closely paralleled that of HMG-CoA reductase. Supplementation of the diet with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, Lovastatin, to a level of 0.02%, raised 14DM mRNA and protein levels 2- to 3-fold. Addition of 2% Colestipol, a bile acid binding resin, to the chow diet caused smaller increases. The highest level of 14DM protein expression was observed in liver, the major site of feedback regulation of HMG-CoA reductase by cholesterol. Taken together, these observations suggest a critical role for 14DM in the feedback regulation of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "17": "Lovastatin treatment caused down-regulation of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) and up-regulation of Glut1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These changes in protein expression were associated with a marked inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Lovastatin had no effect on cell cholesterol levels, but its effects were reversed by mevalonate, demonstrating that inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis causes insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These findings support the notion that whole body insulin resistance may arise as a result of perturbations in general biochemical pathways, rather than primary defects in insulin signalling.", 
    "18": "The highest risk of a recurrent event in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) occurs in the first month, with the rates of reported events ranging from 10% to 25%. Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for the long-term care of patients with stable atherosclerotic disease. More recent accumulated data from several trials now show that statin therapy can also help reduce cardiovascular risk in unstable disease. These studies evaluated the effects of statin therapy begun before discharge, with the Myocardial Ischemia with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) trial showing that therapy could be started as early as 24 hours after onset with measurable clinical benefit. Registry data also suggest that long-term compliance may be improved in patients with a predischarge statin prescription compared with a postdischarge statin prescription. This is because many patients discharged without a statin prescription are either lost to further medical follow-up or do not receive a statin prescription from their primary care provider. The Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III), which constitutes the updated clinical guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), recommends that lipid-lowering drug therapy be initiated at hospital discharge. ATP III also provides important information on the goals of lipid-lowering therapy in patients after ACS. The challenge for the specialist is to establish a predischarge plan that includes maximal dosing to achieve aggressive target goals and to work with the patient's primary care provider to maintain these goals long-term.", 
    "19": "Remarkable therapeutic advances in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have been made with antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy. However, these therapies alone do not appear to completely stabilize culprit lesions. Evidence from a variety of sources suggests that intensive cholesterol lowering with statins favorably influences culprit lesion stabilization in patients with ACS. Potential mechanisms of benefit include improvements in endothelial function, decreased propensity for platelet thrombus formation, and reduction in inflammation at the site of the lesion. The Myocardial Ischemia with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) study is the first large-scale clinical trial to examine whether these mechanisms translate into clinical-event reduction in patients with ACS as well as the substantial proved benefits in the chronic coronary syndromes. In this trial, early initiation of atorvastatin after an episode of unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction reduced events over the ensuing 16 weeks. It is hoped that a growing awareness of the benefits of early statin therapy to stabilize culprit lesions in ACS will lead to an increase in the proportion of coronary patients who will receive this beneficial therapy.", 
    "20": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether human neutrophils express an endothelial-type nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and to study the effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on its expression.", 
    "21": "Several studies have demonstrated the presence of a constitutively expressed nitric oxide svnthase (NOS) in neutrophils. Cardiovascular disease is characterized by increased levels of plasma TNF-alpha, a cytokine that has demonstrated eNOS messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) destabilization in cultured endothelial cells.", 
    "22": "Neutrophils were obtained from healthy volunteers and from patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).", 
    "23": "Human neutrophils express eNOS mRNA and eNOS protein. Stimulation of neutrophils with TNF-alpha decreased eNOS protein expression by reducing eNOS mRNA stabilization. In the present study, we also show that the cytosol of human neutrophils contains proteins that bind to a specific region within the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of eNOS mRNA. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased the binding of the cytosolic proteins to the 3'-UTR of eNOS mRNA. Simvastatin reduced the TNF-alpha-related binding activity of neutrophil cytosolic proteins to eNOS mRNA, which was associated with its protective effect on eNOS protein expression. The in vivo reproduction of the in vitro findings was performed in neutrophils obtained from patients with AMI and showed a diminished expression of eNOS protein, which was associated with increased binding of the cytosolic proteins.", 
    "24": "These observations demonstrate that human neutrophils express eNOS, which is downregulated by TNF-alpha and during AMI. This effect is associated with increased binding of neutrophil cytosolic proteins to the 3'-UTR of eNOS mRNA.", 
    "25": "Atorvastatin is a synthetic hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. In dosages of 10 to 80 mg/day, atorvastatin reduces levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in patients with a wide variety of dyslipidaemias. In large long-term trials in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. atorvastatin produced greater reductions in total cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels than other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), atorvastatin was more efficacious than lovastatin, pravastatin. fluvastatin and simvastatin in achieving target LDL-cholesterol levels and, in high doses, produced very low LDL-cholesterol levels. Aggressive reduction of serum LDL-cholesterol to 1.9 mmol/L with atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 16 weeks in patients with acute coronary syndromes significantly reduced the incidence of the combined primary end-point events and the secondary end-point of recurrent ischaemic events requiring rehospitalisation in the large. well-designed MIRACL trial. In the AVERT trial, aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg/ day for 18 months was at least as effective as coronary angioplasty and usual care in reducing the incidence of ischaemic events in low-risk patients with stable CHD. Long-term studies are currently investigating the effects of atorvastatin on serious cardiac events and mortality in patients with CHD. Pharmacoeconomic studies have shown lipid-lowering with atorvastatin to be cost effective in patients with CHD, men with at least one risk factor for CHD and women with multiple risk factors for CHD. In available studies atorvastatin was more cost effective than most other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in achieving target LDL-cholesterol levels. Atorvastatin is well tolerated and adverse events are usually mild and transient. The tolerability profile of atorvastatin is similar to that of other available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and to placebo. Elevations of liver transaminases and creatine phosphokinase are infrequent. There have been rare case reports of rhabdomyolysis occurring with concomitant use of atorvastatin and other drugs.", 
    "26": "Atorvastatin is an appropriate first-line lipid-lowering therapy in numerous groups of patients at low to high risk of CHD. Additionally it has a definite role in treating patients requiring greater decreases in LDL-cholesterol levels. Long-term studies are under way to determine whether achieving very low LDL-cholesterol levels with atorvastatin is likely to show additional benefits on morbidity and mortality in patients with CHD.", 
    "27": "We examined retrospectively 186 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 163 patients with cardiac insufficiency (CHF) regarding secondary prevention in hospital or externally. Of the Inhospital-patients with ACS 99% had antithrombotic medicaments (AT), 73% betablockers and 73% a statin. CHF-patients had ACEH in 69%. Externally 120 patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD) received in 91% AT, 66% betablocker, 30% statins and 111 CHF-patients in 49% ACEH. Compared to other studies medical therapy ameliorated in CHD and CHF either stationary and ambulatory. The reasons for low prescription of statins may be due to short time since positive results occurred and to the expensive costs in the setting of pressure because of high cost in health system.", 
    "28": "Intracellular Ca(2+) store loading has been shown to alter proliferation and apoptosis of several cell types. In addition, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (i.e. atorvastatin) are effective in treating diabetic dyslipidemic patients. Thus, we hypothesized that chronic atorvastatin treatment would prevent increased Ca(2+) uptake into intracellular Ca(2+) stores in vascular smooth muscle cells from diabetic dyslipidemic pigs. Male Yucatan pigs were divided into four groups for 20 weeks-- (1) low fat fed (control); (2) hyperlipidemic (F); (3) alloxan-induced diabetic dyslipidemic (DF); and (4) diabetic dyslipidemic pigs treated with atorvastatin (DFA). The F, DF, and DFA groups were fed a high fat/cholesterol diet. Cells were isolated from the coronary artery and the myoplasmic Ca(2+) (Ca(m)) response measured using single cell fura-2 imaging. The Ca(m) response to caffeine (5 mM to release Ca(2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, SR) and ionomycin (10 microM; to release the total Ca(2+) store) was determined in either the presence of low Na (19Na; inhibits Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange), thapsigargin (TSG; inhibits the SR Ca(2+) pump), and a 19Na+TSG solution. Low Na induced the uptake of Ca(2+) into both SR and non-SR Ca(2+) stores in the DF group, but not the DFA group. Furthermore, after depletion of the SR Ca(2+) store with TSG, 19Na evoked Ca(2+) uptake into non-SR Ca(2+) stores in all three groups except in the DFA group. In summary, this study demonstrates that atorvastatin prevents the enhanced uptake of Ca(2+) by SR and non-SR Ca(2+) stores in diabetic dyslipidemic pigs.", 
    "29": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase are widely used in the treatment of dyslipemias and have shown beneficial effects in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. There is new information that seems to suggest that the beneficial effects observed may not be solely attributable to plasma cholesterol reduction. Our objective has been to evaluate the effect of two statins at similar dose, although unequivalent plasma lipid lowering potential, on vessel wall expression of two proteins involved in atherosclerotic lesion progression. We have studied the effects of treatment on vessel wall expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (NOS II). Atherosclerosis was induced in pigs by feeding a high cholesterol and saturated fatty acid diet for 50 days. Mild atherosclerotic lesions were found at this early stage of induction. Animals were simultaneously treated with atorvastatin (3 mg/kg/day), pravastatin (3 mg/kg/day) or placebo. Non-HDL-cholesterol levels induced by diet were reduced in the atorvastatin-treated group (63+/-8%, P=0.03) and not as much in the pravastatin treated group (44+/-3, P=0.08). The average MCP-1 expression in carotid, femoral and thoracic aorta was significantly reduced with both statins by 37% (P<0.05), while NOS II expression was unaffected. Therefore, vascular MCP-1 expression was downregulated by statins regardless of their lipid lowering potential and lipo/hydrophilic characteristics. Early downregulation of MCP-1 could attenuate the inflammation within the vascular wall and prevent the development of atherosclerotic lesions.",

This database contains unit dispensing data at the dosage-strength level for 1,079 managed care plans. Trends in market share, mean daily dose, and dosage distribution of the six current statin brands were examined. The relationship of market share to mean dose was also examined for each brand.", 
    "32": "Market share decreased for all statin brands during the two-year period, except for the two newest entries, atorvastatin (up 9.7 share points) and cerivastatin (up 4.6 share points). The mean dose of all statins increased during the two-year period. A statistically significant negative correlation between market share and mean dose was found for atorvastatin and a positive correlation was found for fluvastatin (P < 0.01). Furthermore, atorvastatin share was significantly correlated to lower mean doses of all other statin brands. That is, higher use of atorvastatin was associated with lower doses of all statin products.",

    "34": "Aspirin depresses thrombin generation, probably through a mechanism independent of the cyclooxygenase inhibition, but rather related to acetylation of the platelet membrane macromolecules. This action of aspirin is blunted in hypercholesterolemia. In men with marked hypercholesterolemia, lowering serum cholesterol by a three-month simvastatin treatment is accompanied by a reduction of thrombin generation both at basal conditions in venous blood and after activation of hemostasis by microvascular injury. Similar results are obtained in patients with coronary heart disease and borderline - high cholesterol levels. We assessed tissue-factor initiated coagulation in blood samples collected every 30-seconds from bleeding time wounds in patients with advanced coronary artery disease and total cholesterol levels of 224 mg/dL. Three-month simvastatin treatment depressed blood clotting, leading to reduced rates of prothrombin activation, FVa generation, fibrinogen cleavage, FXIII activation, and an increased rate of FVa inactivation. Such a concerted influence of statins on the clotting cascade seems to be independent of their lipid-lowering action and may be the result of depressed isoprenoid production.",

    "49": "A total of 233 silages were examined and found that Monascus ruber was present in 43 samples with counts between 1 x 10(3) and 9 x 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/g (mean: 2 x 10(5) CFU/g). Monacolin K(L) and the hydroxy acid monacolin K(A) were detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 45 and 50 of 233 samples at levels ranging from 25-15 600 and 28-65 400 microg/kg, respectively. Citrinin was found with high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (FLD) in 14 (6%) samples, the concentrations varied between 2.4 and 64.2 microg/kg. The concentrations of citrinin were low and toxic effects are not anticipated. Monacolin K(A) and monacolin K(L) occur frequently and in considerable amounts in silages. These metabolites are believed to influence the metabolic activity of rumen anaerobic fungi resulting in a poorer digestion of crude fibre.",

A secondary prevention program for coronary bypass patients was established at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine for that purpose. Modifiable risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, are identified preoperatively, and therapy is initiated postoperatively, with follow-up in the Risk Reduction Clinic at 3 and 6 months. Treatment is designed to achieve defined goals in secondary prevention.",

Recently, attention has been paid to beneficial effects of statins on serum lipids and hemostasis in uremic patients. Peritoneally dialyzed (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis; CAPD) subjects are particularly prone to dyslipidemia and have a high risk of cardiovascular death. The purpose of this work was to assess platelet functions, some hemostatic parameters and serum lipids in 8 hyperlipidemic CAPD patients treated with simvastatin (Zocor, MSD) for 6 months.",

    "53": "Whole-blood platelet aggregation induced by collagen decreased significantly after 3 and 6 months of the therapy, whereas in PRP, platelet aggregation induced by collagen and ADP decreased significantly after 6 months. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation in PRP decreased significantly after 3 and 6 months of simvastatin therapy. P-selectin remained unaltered by 6 months of simvastatin therapy. The fibrinolytic activity index was significantly higher after 3 months of the therapy when compared to the baseline values. Thrombomodulin, a marker of endothelial cell injury, was significantly lower after 3 and 6 months of the therapy. Prothrombin fragments 1 + 2 did not change significantly during 6 months of simvastatin administration. Cholesterol and LDL fell significantly as early as after 1 month and remained lowered during further months of the therapy.",

We sought to determine whether therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) might slow the progression of aortic stenosis.", 
    "56": "A retrospective study of 174 patients (mean age 68+/-12 years) with mild to moderate calcific aortic stenosis was conducted. Patients required normal left ventricular function, </=2+ aortic regurgitation, and >/=2 echocardiograms performed at least 12 months apart. Fifty-seven patients (33%) received treatment with a statin; the remaining 117 (67%) did not. The statin group was older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary disease. During a mean follow-up of 21 months, patients treated with statin had a smaller increase in peak and mean gradient and a smaller decrease in aortic valve area. When annualized, the decrease in aortic valve area for the nonstatin group was 0.11+/-0.18 cm(2) compared with 0.06+/-0.16 cm(2) for those treated with a statin (P=0.03). In multivariate analysis, statin usage was a significant independent predictor of a smaller decrease in valve area (P=0.01) and a lesser increase in peak gradient (P=0.02).",

HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors have been shown to have short-term beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction among patients with dyslipidemia or cardiovascular disease. The effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on the endothelial function in diabetes is largely unknown.", 
    "59": "Seventeen patients with type 2 diabetes, free of cardiovascular disease and no other cardiovascular risk factors, except for dyslipidemia, were studied together with ten healthy volunteers. The effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine, as an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, and sodium nitroprusside, as an endothelium-independent vasodilator, on the forearm blood flow was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography.", 
    "60": "5-Hydroxytryptamine and sodium nitroprusside, infused in the brachial artery, caused a dose-dependent vasodilation. The vasodilator response to 5-hydroxytryptamine was significantly lower among the diabetic patients, 42 and 56%, than among the controls, 73 and 103%, at a dose of 0.3 and 0.9 ng/kg/min, respectively (P<0.05 and P<0.001). Vasodilator responses to sodium nitroprusside were comparable among the diabetic patients and controls. A 6-week treatment with simvastatin 40 mg once daily did not change the vasodilator responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine or sodium nitroprusside among the patients with diabetes.",

    "62": "It has been repeatedly proven that statins improve endothelial function in isolated hypercholesterolaemia but there is far less evidence in the case of combined hyperlipidaemia. Studies assessing the effects of fibrates on endothelium have been neglected. Therefore, we conducted a trial in which the effects of fenofibrate and atorvastatin monotherapy on both endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity and biochemical parameters were compared in patients with combined hyperlipidaemia.", 
    "63": "29 otherwise healthy males (aged 47.4+/-7.8 years) with combined hyperlipidaemia (total cholesterol 7.55+/-1.20 mmol/l, triglycerides 5.41+/-4.54 mmol/l) were included into the randomised, single-blind, cross-over study to receive either 200 mg of micronised fenofibrate or 10 mg of atorvastatin daily--each of the drugs for a period of 10 weeks. Analysed biochemical parameters were as follows: serum total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, apolipoproteins A-I and B, triglycerides, fibrinogen, uric acid, C-reactive protein (CRP), insulin, and homocysteine. Endothelial function was investigated by duplex Doppler ultrasonography at the brachial artery. Two indices of endothelial-dependent postischaemic changes were used - the recently introduced index of peak blood flow (PBF) representing the level of reactive hyperaemia and traditional flow-mediated dilatation (FMD).", 
    "64": "We observed a small improvement in FMD after both fenofibrate and atorvastatin (from 2.26% to 2.98% and 2.87%, respectively; NS). PBF increased from 448 ml/min to 536 ml/min after fenofibrate (P=0.04) and to 570 ml/min after atorvastatin (P=0.03). The effects of both fenofibrate and atorvastatin on endothelial function did not differ significantly (P-values of 0.82 and 0.47 for FMD and PBF, respectively). Significant correlations (P<0.01) between the changes of vascular reactivity and biochemical indices were found between FMD and CRP (r=-0.60) and between both FMD and PBF, and insulinaemia (r=-0.48 and -0.56, respectively) only during treatment with fenofibrate.", 
    "65": "Both fenofibrate and atorvastatin significantly improved endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity without mutual difference. The PBF was superior to FMD for the detection of this improvement. The beneficial effect of both drugs did not correlate with the change of lipid profile during therapy. The improvement of vascular reactivity during treatment with fenofibrate (opposed to atorvastatin) was related to the reduction of indirect marker of chronic vessel wall inflammation and of insulin resistance. The PBF was more reproducible than FMD because of considerably lower intra-subject variability.", 
    "66": "Although statins reduce the risk of non-haemorrhagic strokes and transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), little is known about the efficacy of fibrates. This situation has been partly remedied by the recent publication of two-fibrate based trials--The Veterans Affairs High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial (VAHIT) and the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention Trial (BIP). In BIP, bezafibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of a cerebrovascular event (CVE). Bezafibrate increased the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) level by 18% to 40 mg/dl (1.03 mmol/l) and decreased triglyceride (TG) levels by 21% to 115 mg/dl (1.29 mmol/l). In contrast, in VAHIT, gemfibrozil significantly reduced the risk of investigators designated stroke (P=0.04) and TIA (P<0.001). Gemfibrozil increased HDL by 6% to 33 mg/dl (0.85 mmol/l) and decreased TG by 31% to 110 mg/dl (1.25 mmol/l). However, the baseline low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels were higher in BIP than in VAHIT (148 versus 111 mg/dl; 3.82 versus 2.87 mmol/l). LDL levels were not markedly altered by treatment in either trial. Fibrates can improve several CVE predictors, like fibrinogen, lipoprotein (a), insulin sensitivity and platelet activity. Furthermore, lowered HDL and/or raised TG levels are associated with an increased risk of a CVE; fibrates are an appropriate treatment for this lipid profile. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that not only total cholesterol and LDL, but also HDL and TG levels predict the risk of a CVE. Statins, fibrates or a combination of these drugs can modify these variables.", 
    "67": "In the space of a few weeks, four articles appeared in the The Lancet and JAMA suggesting that using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) is associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD) and a reduced fracture risk. The stimulus for these case-control studies came from reports that the statins have unexpected effects on bone, increasing bone formation in rodents. These observations offered a new insight into the potential importance of the cholesterol synthesis pathway in bone turnover and future therapeutic opportunities.", 
    "68": "In animal models, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were able to improve renal function and endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity. In various experimental renal diseases, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors improved the rate of decline in renal function. We studied the effect of simvastatin on ADPKD patients.", 
    "69": "In a double-blind cross-over study, 10 normocholesterolaemic ADPKD patients were treated in random order for 4 weeks with 40 mg simvastatin or placebo daily. After each treatment period, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on renal blood flow and endothelium-dependent vascular reactivity. These periods were separated by a 4-week wash-out period.", 
    "70": "After treatment with simvastatin, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) significantly increased from 124+/-4 ml/min to 132+/-6 ml/min (P<0.05). Simultaneously, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) increased significantly from 494+/-30 ml/min to 619+/-67 ml/min after simvastatin treatment (P<0.05). These renal effects were accompanied by a significantly enhanced vasodilator response to acetylcholine in the forearm after simvastatin treatment. Total serum cholesterol levels were significantly reduced after treatment with simvastatin, from 4.24+/-0.32 to 3.17+/-0.22 mmol/l (P<0.001).", 
    "71": "We concluded that simvastatin treatment can ameliorate renal function in ADPKD patients, by increasing renal plasma flow, possibly via improvement of endothelial function. Long-term clinical trials with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are needed to confirm these results and to establish a chronic inhibiting effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on the progression towards end-stage renal disease in ADPKD patients.", 
    "72": "Inflammatory processes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and mediate many of the stages of atheroma development from initial leukocyte recruitment to eventual rupture of the unstable atherosclerotic plaque. Elevated plasma levels of several markers of the inflammatory cascade have been shown to predict future risk of plaque rupture. These markers include P-selectin, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Produced in the liver in response to interleukin-6, CRP has emerged as the most powerful inflammatory marker of future cardiovascular risk. Initially considered an innocent bystander in the atherosclerotic process, recent evidence suggests that CRP may have direct proinflammatory effects. Numerous large-scale, prospective studies have found that elevated baseline levels of CRP are a strong independent predictor of future vascular risk. Furthermore, aspirin and statin therapy appear to be particularly effective among individuals with high CRP levels. The addition of CRP screening to traditional lipid testing has the potential to identify individuals at high risk for future cardiovascular events who may benefit from targeted preventive interventions.", 
    "73": "Increasingly HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are being used for primary prevention of vascular disease in patients with a raised cholesterol but at low absolute risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This study uses clinical trial results to explore the limits of absolute safety for statin use in such patients.", 
    "74": "The major placebo controlled statin outcome trials were identified by automated and manual literature searches. Principal results including all cause mortality in placebo and intervention groups and baseline values of standard coronary risk factors were abstracted for each trial. For the trials identified the reduction in overall mortality with statin treatment for each study was regressed against the underlying CHD risk of the population recruited into that trial using a statistically robust method.", 
    "75": "The regression line describing the relationship between mortality benefit and risk suggests that statin use could be associated with an increase in mortality of 1% in 10 years. This would be sufficiently large to negate statin's beneficial effect on CHD mortality in patients with a CHD event risk less than 13% over 10 years.", 
    "76": "Absolute safety of statins has not been demonstrated for patients at low risk of CHD. Patients absolute risk of CHD should be calculated before starting statin treatment for primary prevention. Extensions of such treatment to low risk patients should await further evidence of safety.", 
    "77": "A known risk factor for the development of coronary artery disease and subsequent myocardial infarction is hypercholesterolaemia. The widespread nature of this phenomenon in the western world has led to the development of agents which reduce serum cholesterol levels. One such class of agents, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are very effective in cholesterol reduction. Recently, clinical and experimental evidence has amassed suggesting that patients taking statins receive cardiovascular benefits that occur independent of cholesterol reduction. Experimental data suggest that statins may increase levels of nitric oxide (NO) in vivo. This review will address the 'cholesterol-independent' vasculoprotective and cardioprotective effects of statins in animal models. Upon completion, the reader will be familiar with the proposed cholesterol-independent pathways of statins and understand that the cholesterol-independent benefits may arise from enhanced production of NO.", 
    "78": "The rapid growth in the understanding of the relation between cholesterol and coronary heart disease has introduced new challenges to the contemporary management of lipid disorders. The publication of the trials of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A inhibitors (statins) has invigorated support for the lipid hypothesis, and many advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and the potential benefits of the statins. Several international groups have issued guidelines about desirable and undesirable lipid values to help clinical decision making. Despite the availability of such principles, there are many challenges to optimal management of lipid disorders.", 
    "79": "Renal dysfunction due to ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a common problem following renovascular surgery or kidney transplantation. There is a lot of emerging evidence that statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, have anti-inflammatory properties and exert direct beneficial effects on the vascular endothelium. The aim of this study was to determine if pretreatment with pravastatin would attenuate the acute renal dysfunction that occurs following IR injury in an experimental model.", 
    "80": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups (n = 7 per group): control, uninephrectomy, IR group, and IR group pretreated with pravastatin (0.4 mg/kg/day for the preceding 5 days). Following a left nephrectomy the IR injury was induced by cross-clamping the right vascular pedicle for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 2 h. In a separate experiment (n = 6 per group) renal function was assessed 12 and 24 h after reperfusion.", 
    "81": "IR injury causes significant renal dysfunction characterized by oliguria, 0.11 (0.05) ml/h, decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), 0.02 (0.01) ml/min; and marked protein leakage, 7.21 (1.3) g/L, 2 h postreperfusion. This renal dysfunction was also evident 12 and 24 h postreperfusion. This was in contrast to values of 0.61 (0.13) ml/h, 0.23 (0.01) ml/min, and 1.67 (0.12) g/L in the uninephrectomy-only group and values of 2 ml/h, 7.3 ml/min, and 0.72 g/L for uninjured time-matched controls. Pretreatment with pravastatin significantly attenuated IR-induced renal injury, improving urine production to 0.62 (0.2) ml/h and GFR to 0.14 (0.02) ml/min and diminishing protein leakage to 3.76 (0.7) g/L at the 2-h time point. This renoprotective effect was also evident 12 and 24 h postreperfusion. This renal protection was associated with an upregulation of constitutive endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the pravastatin-treated group.", 
    "82": "These results show that pravastatin may play a role in modulating renal impairment following aortic or transplantation surgery, allowing earlier recovery from an IR injury.", 
    "83": "Cardiovascular disease is now the leading cause of death in transplant recipients. This is due, in part, to the vulnerability of these patients to a complicated set of conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and post-transplant hyperlipidaemia (PTHL). PTHL is characterised by persistent elevations in total serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The causes of PTHL are complex and not fully understood, however several classes of immunosuppressants including the corticosteroids, rapamycins and calcineurin inhibitors, appear to play a role. PTHL has been observed in most studies in which patients received calcineurin inhibitor-based regimens, and has been observed with both tacrolimus and cyclosporin. Comparing these calcineurin inhibitors with regard to the relative incidence or severity of PTHL occurring during treatment is difficult because of the use of higher doses of corticosteroids in cyclosporin-based regimens, as compared with tacrolimus-based regimens. However, current expert opinion suggests that the discrepancies in the relative incidence and severity of PTHL are largely accounted for by this difference in corticosteroid dose. At this point in time, evidence for potential differences is scant and inconclusive. Further study is needed, not only to investigate differences in lipid profile, but also of the relative effects of these immunosuppressants on long term graft function as well as on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PTHL can be successfully managed with a combination of dietary management, reduction and, if appropriate, withdrawal of corticosteroids, and the administration of lipid-lowering drugs. With this combination of therapeutic options, the threats to long term health posed by PTHL may be effectively addressed.", 
    "84": "Drug interactions in patients receiving multiple drug regimens are a constant concern for the clinician. With the increased availability of new drugs and their concomitant use with other drugs, there has been a rise in the potential for adverse drug interactions as demonstrated by the recent withdrawals of newly marketed drugs because of unacceptable interaction profiles. Therefore, the interaction potential of a new compound has to be assessed in detail, starting with preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies at candidate selection and continuously followed up through preclinical and clinical development. Since formal in vivo studies of all possible drug interactions are neither practicable nor suggestive, a careful selection of a limited number of drug combinations to be investigated in vivo during the development phase is indicated. Based on knowledge of pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical properties, a well balanced link between in vitro investigations and carefully selected in vivo interaction studies allows full assessment of the potential of a new drug to cause clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions, prediction of a lack of interactions and derivation of the proper dose recommendations. Clinical pharmacology plays a number of key roles within the process of collecting information on drug interactions during preclinical and clinical development: addressing issues and/or favourable properties to be expected, thus contributing to the scientific assessment of development potential; setting up a rational in vivo drug-drug interaction programme; performing early mechanistic studies to link in vitro with in vivo information (employing 'cocktail' approaches if possible); reviewing co-medication sections for clinical trials; and conducting labelling-oriented interaction studies, after proof of concept. The fact that interactions can occur between various active substances should by itself be a conclusive argument against unnecessary polypharmacy. Prescribing fewer drugs on a rational basis can reduce the risk of adverse effects secondary to drug interactions and may help to improve the quality of drug treatment and to save costs.", 
    "85": "Effects of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, simvastatin and atorvastatin, on diltiazem-induced hypotension were examined in anaesthetized rats and compared to that of pravastatin. Vehicle, 2 mg/kg/day simvastatin, 2 mg/kg/day atorvastatin, or 4 mg/kg/day pravastatin was administered orally for 4 days. Diltiazem at 3 mg/kg was given orally 2 hours after the final administration of the inhibitors. Arterial blood pressure was measured via a cannula introduced into the left carotid artery, and heart rate was counted from the pulse pressure. In all groups, diltiazem significantly decreased the mean arterial blood pressure without any changes in heart rate. Pretreatment with simvastatin and atorvastatin significantly enhanced the hypotensive effect of diltiazem, while that with pravastatin did not. Heart rate was not modified by pretreatment with the inhibitors. The results indicate that concomitant use of diltiazem with simvastatin or atorvastatin enhances diltiazem-induced hypotension, probably by competitive inhibition of diltiazem metabolism with simvastatin and atorvastatin metabolisms.", 
    "86": "There is accumulating evidence that statins reduce stroke risk, even though total cholesterol is not a risk factor for stroke. The explanation for this discrepancy is subject to discussion. It should be realised that the beneficial effects of statins on stroke risk have only been demonstrated in a select population, i.e. middle-aged men with ischaemic heart disease. Several clinical trials are underway to examine the effects of statins on stroke risk in more characteristic groups of patients who are at increased risk of developing stroke. The results of these studies should be awaited before statins are recommended for the prevention of stroke. Recently it has been reported that statins lower the risk of developing dementia. These conclusions were drawn from two cross-sectional studies. Because of the nature of the studies, only an association between the use of statins and a lower risk of developing dementia was shown, and not a causal relationship. Experimentally-controlled studies have to be designed to investigate the effect of statins on dementia.", 
    "87": "Although 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors can protect the myocardium against ischemic injury, the mechanisms of their effect have not yet been characterized at the cellular level. Therefore, we investigated the role of cardiac ATP-sensitive K+ (K(ATP)) channels induced by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor known as pravastatin on the myocardial metabolism during ischemia by phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) in isolated rabbit hearts. Forty-five min of continuous normothermic global ischemia was carried out. Pravastatin with or without the K(ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME was administered beginning 60 min prior to the global ischemia. Twenty-eight hearts were divided into 4 experimental groups consisting of 7 hearts each: the control group, the P group consisting of pravastatin treatment, the P+G group consisting of pravastatin treatment with glibenclamide, and the P+L group consisting of pravastatin treatment with L-NAME. During ischemia, the decreases in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and intracellular pH (pHi) were significantly inhibited in the P group in comparison with Control group (at end of ischemia, respectively; both p<0.01), as was the increase in inorganic phosphate (Pi) (at end of ischemia, p<0.01). However, the decreases in ATP and pHi and the increase in Pi were not inhibited in the P+G group during ischemia. The P+L group also showed no inhibition of the aforementioned parameters during the same period. These results suggest that pravastatin has a significant beneficial effect for improving the myocardial energy metabolism, which is provided by K(ATP) channels and nitric oxide (NO), during myocardial ischemia. The cardioprotection of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor may be caused by the K(ATP) channels that are mediated by the NO.", 
    "88": "To prevent cardiovascular events in hyperlipidaemic patients, plaque stabilization by inhibition of localized inflammatory reactions in the blood vessels is important in addition to cholesterol lowering. Cerivastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin), has more potent enzyme-inhibitory effects than other statins and has also been reported in vitro to inhibit, at low concentrations, various inflammatory reactions due to plaque instability. Cerivastatin was therefore administered over 12 months to five patients with hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerotic plaque diagnosed by ultrasonography of the carotid artery, and changes in the plaque composition were determined. The mean cholesterol level decreased over the study period, although not significantly. However, the mean percentage of fibrous matrix of the plaque increased significantly from a mean of 11.2 +/- 7.7% at study entry to 18.3 +/- 5.9% at the end of the study. Additionally, the mean maximum plaque height was significantly reduced from 3.7 +/- 0.9 mm to 3.0 +/- 0.7 mm. These results indicate that cerivastatin induces plaque stability independently of cholesterol lowering.", 
    "89": "The presentations at the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2001 meeting reported or updated the results of phase I, II, and III randomized trials and also reported important meta-analyses and retrospective studies impacting on the management of patients with melanoma. In the treatment of early stage melanoma, the prognostic significance of pathologic status of sentinel lymph nodes was affirmed. With respect to regional nodal involvement (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage III), investigators presented the interim results of the United Kingdom randomized low-dose interferon (IFN) trial, and up-to-date meta-analyses of several IFN trials including a pooled analysis of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trials evaluating interferon in the adjuvant setting. In the advanced disease setting (AJCC stage IV), several studies elucidated the pros and cons of biochemotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma, with an emphasis on seeking to improve response in the central nervous system and durability of response in general. Thought provoking was new data regarding the potential for lovastatin to act as a chemopreventive agent for melanoma. Translational studies were presented, one supporting the importance of HLA-typing in developing targeted vaccine therapy. Finally, the results of a novel experimental melanoma vaccine were presented using autologous tumor-derived heat-shock protein peptide complex-96 (HSPPC-96).", 
    "90": "Paraoxonase (PON) is an enzyme carried by high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Two gene polymorphisms leading to amino acid substitutions of methionine for leucine at position 55 (M/L55) and arginine for glutamine at position 192 (R/Q192) modulate the activity of the enzyme and possibly also lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations. Our purpose was to examine the effect of the PON genotype on HDL-C and apolipoprotein AI (apo AI) responses to pravastatin treatment. Fifty-one mildly hypercholesterolemic male subjects (mean age 35 +/- 4 years) were enrolled by this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. Lipid concentrations were measured at baseline and after 6 months of pravastatin (n = 25) or placebo (n = 26) therapy. Low active (MM, ML or QQ) and high active (LL or RQ, RR) PON genotype groups were related to lipid and apolipoprotein concentration changes. Pravastatin increased the apo AI concentration 12% (P = 0.017, RANOVA) and tended to increase the HDL-C concentration (P = 0.095, RANOVA) in R allele carriers but not in QQ homozygotes. Significant predictors of the change in apo AI concentration during pravastatin treatment were R/Q192 genotype (P = 0.002), apo AI concentration at baseline (P = 0.002) and M/L55 genotype (P = 0.042). Correspondingly, R/Q192 (P = 0.009) and M/L55 (P = 0.050) genotypes were the statistically significant determinants of HDL-C concentration change. The PON genotype thus modifies the effect of pravastatin on serum HDL-C and apo AI concentrations. This could partly explain the contradictory results obtained from previous studies on the effects of statins on the serum HDL-C concentration.", 
    "91": "HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors, or statins, are prescribed widely to lower cholesterol. Accumulating evidence indicates that statins have various effects on vascular cells, which are independent of their lipid-lowering effect. Here, we tested the hypothesis that statins may augment collateral flow to ischemic tissues. We induced hind-limb ischemia in wild-type mice and treated them with either saline or cerivastatin. Cerivastatin enhanced the blood flow recovery dramatically as determined by Laser Doppler imaging. The mice treated with saline displayed frequent autoamputation of the ischemic toe, which was prevented completely by cerivastatin. Anti-CD31 immunostaining revealed that cerivastatin significantly increased the capillary density. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity was enhanced markedly in the mice treated with cerivastatin. The angiogenic effect of cerivastatin was abrogated in eNOS deficient (eNOS-/-) mice. These results indicate that eNOS is essential for cerivastatin to promote collateral growth in response to ischemia.", 
    "92": "1. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) prevent the progression of atherosclerosis by lowering cholesterol. However, the effect of statins on the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines from endothelial cells has not yet been fully investigated. Here, we examined the effect of pravastatin, one of the statins, on IL-8 synthesis induced by thrombin in human aortic endothelial cells (AoEC) cultured with high glucose concentrations. 2. Pravastatin significantly decreased the IL-8 synthesis induced by thrombin. 3. Pravastatin inhibited the p44/42 MAP kinase activity induced by thrombin, but did not inhibit the p38 MAP kinase activity. 4. Translocation of ras protein from the cytosol to plasma membrane was inhibited by pravastatin. 5. Pravastatin inhibit the activator protein-1 activity, but did not inhibit the activation of IkappaB-alpha. 6. Dominant negative ras inhibited the p44/42 MAP kinase activity induced by PMA. 7. Our results suggest that pravastatin inhibits IL-8 synthesis by blocking the ras-MAP (p44/42) kinase pathway rather than nuclear factor-kappaB. Pravastatin may prevent atherosclerosis not only by lowering cholesterol levels, but also by suppressing IL-8 synthesis in AoEC through the inhibition of p44/42 MAP kinase, and this may be more beneficial in diabetic patients than in non-diabetics.",

The objectives of the present study were to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for the induction of hypercholesterolemia as well as to determine whether this animal model may be of potential use in rank ordering the efficacy (lipid lowering) of various statin drugs. The effect of long-term (16 weeks) administration of P-407 on the catalytic activities of rate-limiting enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis [HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR)] and catabolism [microsomal cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (C7alphaH) and mitochondrial sterol 27 hydroxylase (S27H)] was assessed in C57BL/6 mice. Effects of P-407 on these enzymes were compared in mice fed an atheroma-inducing diet (high-cholesterol, supplemented with cholic acid) and animals maintained on a basal diet and injected with saline (controls) after 16 weeks. The mean value for the activities of C7alphaH in P-407-injected mice was 24.3+/-3.8 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) and was significantly (P<0.05) less than the mean value determined for sham-injected control animals (37.0+/-14.3 pmol min(-1) mg(-1)). In contrast, the mean values for the catalytic activities of S27H and HMGR did not change with P-407 administration. Neither C7alphaH nor S27H activity in mice fed the high-cholesterol diet differed from values for control animals, whereas the mean HMGR activity was drastically reduced (-94%, P<0.05). The hypercholesterolemic effect of P-407 is not due to altered cholesterol biosynthesis, but is mediated by reduced cholesterol catabolism due to decreased activity of the rate limiting enzyme (C7alphaH) in the classic bile acid synthetic pathway. Plasma triglyceride lowering resulting from the oral administration of equal doses of various statin drugs appeared, in general, to be positively correlated with their relative aqueous solubility and paralleled the efficacy of these agents to lower low-density-lipoprotein-associated cholesterol (LDL-C) in humans. The plasma triglyceride lowering effect of the five statin drugs tested produced the following rank order; pravastatin sodium (-44%)>atorvastatin calcium (-36%)>simvastatin (-33%)>lovastatin (-25%)>fluvastatin sodium (-19%). While reductions in plasma total cholesterol following administration of the statin drugs was not as profound as that observed with triglycerides, the relative rank order or trend was preserved. The percent reduction in plasma triglycerides in the present model appears to be a useful parameter with which to predict the relative reduction in plasma LDL-C expected for these agents in humans.",

This has further widened the gap between the number of people being treated compared with those who should be treated. Moreover, many people being treated do not meet their LDL cholesterol goal. Diet and healthy lifestyle practices remain the cornerstone of treatment to lower LDL cholesterol. Pharmacologic therapy has assumed an increasingly important role in reaching LDL cholesterol goals. Diet and healthy-lifestyle interventions have been shown to augment the benefits of cholesterol-lowering drugs.

    "103": "The aims of this study were to examine the presence of mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene among subjects clinically diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia and to analyze whether the molecular diagnosis helps to predict the response to simvastatin treatment in our familial hypercholesterolemia population. Fifty-five probands and 128 related subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia were studied. Genetic diagnosis was carried out following a three-step protocol based on Southern blot and PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism analysis. A randomized clinical trial with simvastatin was conducted in 42 genetically diagnosed subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia classified as carriers of null mutations (n = 22) and of defective mutations (n = 20). A mutation-causing familial hypercholesterolemia was identified in 46 probands (84%). In 41 of them (89%), a total of 28 point mutations were detected, 13 of which have not been previously described. The remaining five probands (11%) were carriers of large rearrangements. Familial hypercholesterolemia with null mutations showed a poor response to simvastatin treatment. The mean percentage reduction of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in these subjects were significantly lower (24.8 +/- 10.3 vs. 34.8 +/- 10.9, P = 0.04 and 30.0 +/- 39.8 vs. 46.1 +/- 18.2, P = 0.02, respectively) than in subjects with defective mutations. Baseline and posttreatment high-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma values were significantly lower in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia with null mutations (P < 0.001). In an outbreed Caucasian population, a three-step protocol for genetic screening detected a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in a high percentage (84%) of subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia.

    "104": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitors (statins) are mainly considered for long-term use and often constitute part of a multiple-drug regime. Besides common adverse drug effects, such as nausea, abdominal discomfort and headaches, all statins harbour the risk of myopathy and fatal rhabdomyolysis. Usually, the frequency of myopathy is low but the incidence increases during concomitant drug therapy. Statins do not differ in their pharmacodynamic property. Therefore, the differences in their pharmacokinetic profiles, i.e. affinity for metabolising enzymes, constitute the rationale for choosing a specific statin especially for combination therapy. In order to point out harmful combinations of therapeutics, this review summarises the pharmacokinetic data of six clinically used statins (atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin) with special regard to metabolism and drug interactions. In summary, statins that lack a significant hepatic metabolism, i.e. pravastatin, or that are metabolised by more than one cytochrome P450 isoenzyme, i.e. fluvastatin, or whose metabolism is taken over by other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in case of blockage of the main metabolising enzyme, i.e. cerivastatin, are the least prone to drug interactions. Nevertheless, in case of a specific concomitant drug therapy known to be associated with a higher risk of adverse events, i.e. cyclosporin A and statin, clinical symptoms of myopathy and biochemical data, such as increasing serum creatine phosphokinase, should be monitored carefully.", 
    "105": "It has been clearly established that lipid-lowering treatments [such as 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutamyl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ('statins') or fibrates] can reduce cardiovascular events, and with one of the statins even total mortality, in high-risk populations. Intervention studies have not included the very old, but it is generally assumed that this patient group would benefit from these treatments to an extent similar to younger patients. Worries about the associations seen in observational studies between low cholesterol levels and cancer, cerebral haemorrhage or mood and behaviour change have been largely overcome by findings from the latest large drug intervention trials, which do not show any increase in these conditions with statin or fibrate treatments. The common adverse effects associated with these drugs are relatively mild and often transient in nature. Potentially more serious adverse effects, which are more clearly related to drug treatment and are probably dose-dependent, include elevations in hepatic transaminase levels and myopathy; however, these effects are uncommon and generally resolve rapidly when treatment is stopped. The risk of myopathy with fibrate treatment is increased in patients with renal impairment, and the risk of myopathy with statin treatment increases with co-administration of drugs that inhibit statin metabolism or transport. Other adverse effects are related to specific drugs, for example, clofibrate is associated with an increased risk of gallstones. Studies in elderly patients have not shown an increased risk of adverse effects with lipid-lowering drugs compared with younger patients, but in clinical practice there may be some increased risk, particularly with regards to drug interactions. Therefore, lipid-lowering drugs should be administered with extra caution to elderly patients.", 
    "106": "In most insect species, juvenile hormones regulate critical physiological processes such as metamorphosis and reproduction. In insects, these sesquiterpenoids are synthesized by retrocerebral endocrine organs, the corpora allata, via the classical mevalonate (MVA) pathway. One of these compounds, juvenile hormone III (JH III), has also been identified in the sedge Cyperus iria. In higher plants, biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid backbone may proceed through two distinct pathways: the MVA pathway or the 2C-methyl erythritol 4-phosphate pathway or through a combination of both pathways. Cell suspension cultures of C. iria were used to elucidate the biosynthetic pathway of JH III in the plant. Enzyme inhibition and labeling studies conclusively demonstrated that the biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid backbone of JH III proceeds via the MVA pathway. Inhibitor and precursor feeding studies also suggest that later steps of JH III biosynthesis in C. iria are similar to the insect pathway and that the final enzymatic reaction in JH III biosynthesis is catalyzed by a cytochrome P(450) monooxygenase.", 
    "107": "Statins have been postulated to affect bone metabolism. We investigated the effects of different doses of simvastatin (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), atorvastatin (2.5 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), and pravastatin (10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) administered orally for 12 weeks to intact female Sprague-Dawley rats and the effect of 20 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) simvastatin in sham-operated and ovariectomized rats on femoral bone mineral density (BMD) and quantitative bone histomorphometry (QBH) and compared them with controls. BMD was decreased by 1 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) simvastatin (P=0.042), atorvastatin (P=0.0002), and pravastatin (P=0.002). The effect on QBH parameters differed with different doses of simvastatin (ANOVA, P=0.00012). QBH parameters of both bone formation and resorption were equivalently and markedly increased by 20 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) simvastatin in 2 separate groups of intact rats and were reflected by a relatively unchanged BMD. At lower doses, 1 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) simvastatin decreased bone formation while increasing bone resorption, as reflected by a marked decrease in BMD. Ovariectomized animals receiving 20 mg. kg(-1). d(-1) simvastatin showed no change in BMD relative to the untreated, ovariectomized controls; their increase in bone formation was smaller than in sham-operated rats receiving simvastatin, and there was no change in bone resorption. Dose-response curves of simvastatin for bone formation and resorption differed. These studies indicate that (1) statins decrease BMD in rodents, (2) high-dose simvastatin increases bone formation and resorption, (3) low-dose simvastatin decreases bone formation and increases bone resorption, (4) the effects of simvastatin on QBH differ at different dosages, (5) the effects of simvastatin seen in intact rats are not observed in ovariectomized rats, and (6) simvastatin is unable to prevent bone loss caused by ovariectomy.", 
    "108": "Quantitative characterization of atherosclerotic plaque composition with standard histopathological methods remains limited to sectioned plaques. Raman spectroscopy enables nondestructive quantification of atherosclerotic plaque composition. We used Raman spectroscopy to study the effects of diet and lipid-lowering therapy on plaque development in apolipoprotein (APO) E*3-Leiden transgenic mice. Raman spectra were obtained over the full width and entire length of the ascending aorta and aortic arch. Spectra were modeled to calculate the relative dry weights of cholesterol and calcium salts, and quantitative maps of their distribution were created. In male mice (n=20) that received a high-fat/high-cholesterol (HFC) diet for 0, 2, 4, or 6 months, Raman spectroscopy showed good correlation between cholesterol accumulation and total serum cholesterol exposure (r approximately 0.87, P<0.001). In female mice (n=10) that were assigned to an HFC diet, with or without 0.01% atorvastatin, a strong reduction in cholesterol accumulation (57%) and calcium salts (97%) (P<0.01) was demonstrated in the atorvastatin-treated group. In conclusion, Raman spectroscopy can be used to quantitatively study the size and distribution of depositions of cholesterol and calcification in APOE*3-Leiden transgenic mice. This study encourages Raman spectroscopy for the quantitative investigation of atherosclerosis and lipid-lowering therapy in larger animals or humans in vivo.", 
    "109": "Cardiovascular disease mortality rates have decreased in men during the past 20 years, but have steadily increased in women. In the United States, >500,000 women die of coronary artery disease (CAD) every year. Although many factors can influence an individual's risk for CAD, some factors are unique to women, including reproductive status. Menopause is associated with significant elevations in serum cholesterol levels and a 3-fold increase in the risk of CAD. It has been suggested that these changes result from a reduction in the level of estrogen. However, recent data from prospective clinical trials have not found any evidence that hormone replacement therapy protects against cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, several studies have shown that, in women, lipid lowering with statin therapy can reduce coronary events. On the strength of these findings, the Beyond Endorsed Lipid Lowering with Electron-Beam Computed Tomography Scanning (BELLES) trial-a 1-year, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study-has been specifically designed to determine the benefits of aggressive statin therapy on the progression of atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women.", 
    "110": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), characterized by obstruction of the arteries in the lower limbs, is an important manifestation of atherosclerosis. There are >10 million individuals with PAD in the United States alone, and as the overall population in developed countries ages, PAD will become increasingly prevalent. Many individuals with PAD are asymptomatic and therefore remain undiagnosed and untreated. Most patients with PAD are at high risk for having a serious coronary or cerebrovascular event. Even for patients in whom symptoms, such as leg pain, are clearly evident, current treatment strategies tend to ignore the systemic nature of the disease and do not reduce overall atherosclerotic risk. Proven medical treatment options for patients with intermittent claudication include smoking cessation, exercise, and cilostazol. Pentoxifylline appears marginally effective. Several novel therapies for PAD are currently under investigation. Of particular interest are the observations from some studies that show that lipid-lowering therapy might be of benefit to PAD patients. The results of 2 ongoing prospective trials of dyslipidemic therapy in claudicants should further clarify the benefits of reducing serum lipid levels in patients with established PAD.", 
    "111": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an elevated risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. This risk is partly attributable to an increased prevalence of classic coronary artery disease risk factors and partly because of hyperglycemia itself and a highly atherogenic lipid profile. The altered composition of lipoproteins and lipids in type 2 diabetic patients, termed diabetic dyslipidemia, is characterized by: (1) elevated levels of triglyceride; (2) normal levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); (3) reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); (4) elevated levels of apolipoprotein B; (5) a preponderance of small, dense LDL particles; and (6) increased levels of cholesterol-rich very-low-density lipoprotein. In most cases, diabetic dyslipidemia is preceded by hyperinsulinemia resulting from insulin resistance. Because patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance are at a markedly increased risk of atherosclerosis, and because strict control of glycemia has proved beneficial in reducing microangiopathy but not macroangiopathy, treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia should be aggressive. Target levels have, therefore, been set at <2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) for LDL-C, <2.3 mmol/L [200 mg/dL] for triglycerides, and >1.15 mmol/L (45 mg/dL) for HDL-C. Trial data suggest that these target levels are likely to be achieved with statins, if necessary, in combination with fibrates or nicotinic acid derivatives. Furthermore, in large-scale clinical trials (eg, Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [4S] and the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events [CARE] study), it has been demonstrated that lipid lowering can appreciably reduce cardiovascular events in diabetic patients.", 
    "112": "Cerebrovascular disease is the leading cause of disability in Western societies. In the United States, it has been estimated that a stroke occurs every 53 seconds. Consequently, the societal costs attributable to cerebrovascular disease are immense and encourage the medical community to seek new therapies that can reduce stroke's frequency and impact. Although serum lipid levels have not been shown to act as a surrogate marker for stroke, in landmark lipid-lowering trials, statin therapy has been associated with reductions in the incidence of ischemic stroke in patient populations with manifest ischemic heart disease. This observation is supported by a recently published meta-analysis of statin trials that reported an average reduction of about 30% in the incidence of cerebrovascular disease. However, to date, statin studies have only been conducted in patients with, or at high risk for coronary artery disease, who are not truly representative of the overall stroke population. The ongoing Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction of Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial has been designed to prospectively evaluate the benefits of aggressive lipid-lowering therapy on cerebrovascular events in patients who have had a previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, but who have no prior history of coronary artery disease.", 
    "113": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of death in the United States, and most acute CAD events occur unexpectedly in patients unaware of their condition. Consequently, attention has recently focused on the development of new technologies for the early detection of CAD, such as electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT). With EBCT imaging, the coronary artery tree is visualized noninvasively and vascular calcification, a marker of atherosclerotic disease, is easily detected and its extent quantified. Current research suggests that the presence of coronary artery calcification on a screening EBCT image provides relevant prognostic information for the development of future coronary events. Furthermore, preliminary evidence suggests that the use of EBCT to observe the progression of disease, as demonstrated by changes in the coronary calcium burden on sequential studies, is a viable and exciting new application. The Beyond Endorsed Lipid Lowering with EBCT Scanning (BELLES) trial will use EBCT to compare the effects of 12 months of treatment with aggressive or moderate statin therapy on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.",

    "115": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, both in the United States and worldwide. It has become widely recognized that a high percentage of cardiovascular events, including sudden cardiac death, occur in previously asymptomatic individuals. Consequently, the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary artery disease (CAD), is an important objective of modern health-care policy. To identify and target high-risk individuals for lifestyle and therapeutic interventions, aggressive screening of the healthy population at risk of developing CAD (or other atherosclerotic disease) is necessary. Because of the complex and often synergistic relations between independent risk factors, it is also important that a multifactorial approach to the treatment of cardiovascular risk factors is adopted. Although treatment guidelines and goals for certain risk factors have been published by national and international organizations, recent evidence suggests that these recommendations are not always adopted in clinical practice. Therefore, considerable potential remains for primary care physicians to further reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in presymptomatic individuals.", 
    "116": "Cholesterol lowering with statins reduces coronary events in a primary-prevention setting and in patients with stable coronary disease. However, where the risk of a coronary event is highest, in the early months after an episode of unstable angina or non-Q-wave infarction, the effect of statin therapy has not been evaluated until recently. The lack of an early benefit in the 3 main statin trials in stable coronary disease may have discouraged this type of investigation. Yet, evidence suggests that intensive cholesterol lowering can rapidly influence several mechanisms intimately related to the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes; specifically, improvement in endothelial function, decreased propensity for platelet thrombus formation, and reduced inflammation. Furthermore, 3 nonrandomized, observational studies have recently reported an improved outcome in statin-treated compared with untreated patients after acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "117": "In the past, we believed that atherosclerosis gradually and progressively led to the complete occlusion of an artery, thereby causing acute coronary events. However, we now understand that rupture of a nonstenotic, yet vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque frequently leads to an acute coronary syndrome. Rupture-prone plaques typically have a thin fibrous cap, numerous inflammatory cells, a substantial lipid core, and surprisingly few smooth muscle cells. Physical disruption of such a plaque allows circulating blood coagulation factors to meet with the highly thrombogenic material in the plaque's lipid core, thereby instigating the formation of a potentially occluding and fatal thrombus. Much evidence implicates inflammation in the thinning of the fibrous cap and the disruption of the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. Lipid lowering undisputedly reduces the incidence of acute coronary events. However, the hypothesis that the mechanism of event reduction involves regression of fixed stenoses has proved untenable. In 14 angiographic studies, treatment of abnormal lipid levels increased luminal diameter only modestly, in stark contrast to the resounding and consistent decrease in acute coronary events produced by lipid lowering. Therefore, we now believe that lipid-lowering treatments, such as statins, modify plaques qualitatively as much as quantitatively, reducing inflammation and stabilizing noncritically stenotic, yet vulnerable plaques. Studies in rabbits with diet-induced atherosclerosis have shown that reducing cholesterol consumption indeed decreases inflammation in atheroma and improves those features of plaques associated with stability.",

The results of the experiments have shown that lovastatin is unstable to oxidation under higher temperatures and in the presence of oxygen, and that some antioxidants markedly stabilize the drug. The most significant antioxidative effect was seen with caffeic acid and rutin, followed by gallic acid and quercetin. Ascorbic acid was only moderately effective. The results prove that flavonoids do have significant antioxidative potential. This phenomenon can be used to improve oxidative stability of drugs such as lovastatin which are sensitive to the presence of oxygen."
