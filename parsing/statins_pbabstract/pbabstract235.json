    "0": "The population of patients with advanced coronary artery disease (CAD) is growing as a result of the aging of the general population, the extensive use of revascularization, and the efficacy of therapies that have prolonged the survival of patients with severe atherosclerosis. Patients with symptomatic CAD survive to a point where little else can be done to relieve their angina. Despite an anticipated growth in the number of patients with this condition within the next few decades, advanced CAD receives relatively little attention by the medical and research communities. As a result, the scope of the disease is not well defined, its coverage in guidelines from professional associations is limited, and few new medical options are available. In response to this, a group of experts from different fields were brought together at a meeting held December 4 to 5, 2006. This document has been developed as a 2-part article. In the first part, the contemporary and emerging therapies for advanced CAD were reviewed. The present part reviews the current status of understanding of advanced CAD, the limits of contemporary therapies, and the difficulties in and barriers to the development of new treatments.", 
    "1": "The following report is based on a working group meeting about advanced coronary artery disease for patients with refractory ischemia who cannot receive revascularization. The aims were to review currently available treatment strategies, define unmet clinical needs, explore clinical trial design issues, and identify promising novel therapeutic targets and approaches for patients with chronic ischemia. The Working Group brought together medical experts in the management of refractory angina with representatives from regulatory agencies, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and industry. The meeting began with presentations reviewing the limitations of the current medical therapies and revascularization strategies and focused on lessons learned from past therapeutic attempts to optimize outcomes and on what are considered to be the most promising new approaches. Perspectives from clinical experts and from regulatory agencies were juxtaposed against needs and concerns of industry regarding development of new therapeutic strategies. This report presents the considerations and conclusions of the meeting on December 4-5, 2006. This document has been developed as a 2-part article, with contemporary and emerging therapies for advanced coronary artery disease reviewed first. Trial design, end points, and regulatory issues will be discussed in the second part of the article.", 
    "2": "Lovastatin is a lipid-lowering agent indicated for primary hypercholesterolemia. This study has assessed single-dosing pharmacokinetics of lovastatin and of its main metabolite, lovastatin beta-hydroxyacid, and has compared the pharmacokinetics of two formulations of lovastatin, a test lovastatin generic (LVSG), and a reference (mevinacor 40 MSD) preparation. The pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence of the two formulations of lovastatin were evaluated by a two-way cross-over randomized double blinded study, in 36 healthy volunteers after a single oral dose of 2 x 40 mg per subject. On plasma samples, collected at given intervals of time (0-24h), lovastatin and its main active metabolite were assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography with positive turbo ion spray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection. The pharmacokinetic parameters, area under the curve total (AUC(t)) and to infinity (AUC(inf)), peak plasma concentration (C(max)), time to attain peak (t(max)), and elimination half-life (t(1/2)) were determined and analyzed statistically. Only minor differences in the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin and lovastatin hydroxyacid between LVSG and mevinacor were found. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) did not show any significant difference between the two formulations, and 90% confidence intervals fell within the acceptable range for bioequivalence. The tolerability profile was good and comparable for the two formulations of lovastatin. Our study, which was performed with the largest number of subjects compared with those published in literature, indicates the bioequivalence of LVSG and mevinacor tablets. The high inter-subject variability of parameters investigated indicate the need of appropriate sample size in pharmacokinetics studies with lovastatin.", 
    "3": "Metabolic syndrome represents a constellation of risk factors associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease and progression to diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance, a state of decreased biologic response to physiologic concentrations of insulin, is a key component of this syndrome and seems to be the result of a primary defect at the skeletal muscle glucose transporter. Acute illness and the perioperative period are characterized by a state of insulin resistance that manifests as hyperglycemia and leads to various other metabolic and biochemical alterations that adversely affect end organ function. Hyperglycemia in acutely ill patients adversely affects outcome. Achieving euglycemia seems beneficial in certain clinical situations, but considerable disagreement exists regarding the target blood sugar levels, the duration of therapy, and the modality. Pharmacotherapy, exercise, and nutrition to improve insulin sensitivity seem promising but require further evaluation to confirm their efficacy for perioperative risk reduction. This review discusses the pathophysiology and the clinical implications of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance in the acutely ill patient with an emphasis on perioperative modulation strategies.", 
    "4": "The incidence of cardiovascular disease is markedly increased in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). High serum cholesterol is widely recognised as a cardiovascular risk factor in the general population. However, in patients with ESRD high concentrations of cholesterol are associated with a better survival. This reverse epidemiology is, amongst others, caused by confounding due to malnutrition and chronic inflammation. In this population, treatment with statins to lower the serum cholesterol remains a matter of debate. In ESRD, LDL cholesterol is modified by increased oxidative stress. These altered LDL particles play a pivotal role in the development of atherosclerosis. Treatment with the antioxidant vitamin E has not equivocally been shown to be beneficial in this population. This review tries to put data from literature on dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress in ESRD in perspective.", 
    "5": "Hypercholesterolaemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Treatment with lipid lowering agents reduces the risk of vascular events. Colesevelam is a novel bile acid sequestrant (BAS) indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, either as monotherapy or in combination with statins.", 
    "6": "This article reviews the efficacy, tolerability and safety of colesevelam in clinical practice. The literature search was based on a PubMed search up to January 2008.", 
    "7": "Colesevelam, used alone or in combination with other hypolipidaemic agents (statins, ezetimibe and fenofibrate), has an overall favourable effect on lipid profile. Specifically, colesevelam reduces total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apolipoprotein B levels and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI. However, colesevelam may slightly raise triglyceride levels. Colesevelam can improve glycaemic control in diabetic patients. Moreover, it may have anti-inflammatory properties, as it can reduce high sensitivity C-reactive protein concentration. Colesevelam almost lacks the intense side effects of previously used BASs, thus resulting in better patient compliance. However, the dose regimen consisting of up to 7 tablets/day and high cost may limit its use.", 
    "8": "Colesevelam is a safe alternative for those intolerant to other lipid lowering medication. This BAS also provides an option for patients who do not reach their LDL-C goal despite treatment with a statin.", 
    "9": "Statins are first-line pharmacotherapeutic agents for hypercholesterolemia treatment in humans. However the effects of statins in animal models of atherosclerosis are not very consistent. Thus we wanted to evaluate whether atorvastatin possesses hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects in mice lacking apolipoprotein E/low-density lipoprotein receptor (apoE/LDLR-deficient mice). Two-month-old female apoE/LDLR-deficient mice (n=24) were randomly subdivided into 3 groups. The control group of animals (n=8) was fed with the western type diet (atherogenic diet) and in other two groups atorvastatin was added to the atherogenic diet at the dosage of either 10 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg per day for a period of 2 months. Biochemical analysis of lipids, ELISA analysis of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in blood, quantification of lesion size and expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the atherosclerotic lesion by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were performed. The biochemical analysis showed that administration of atorvastatin (100 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased level of total cholesterol, lipoproteins (VLDL and LDL), triacylglycerol, and moreover significantly increased level of HDL. ELISA analysis showed that atorvastatin significantly decreased levels of MCP-1 in blood and immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis showed significant reduction of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression in the vessel wall after atorvastatin treatment (100 mg/kg/day). In conclusion, we demonstrated here for the first time strong hypolipidemic and anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin in apoE/LDLR-deficient mice. Thus, we propose that apoE/LDLR-deficient mice might be a good animal model for the study of statin effects on potential novel markers involved in atherogenesis and for the testing of potential combination treatment of new hypolipidemic substances with statins.", 
    "10": "Diabetic vascular complication is a leading cause of acquired blindness, end-stage renal failure, a variety of neuropathies and accelerated atherosclerosis, which could account for disabilities and high mortality rates in patients with diabetes. Although several hyperglycemia-elicited metabolic and hemodynamic derangements have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complication, the process of formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their mode of action are most compatible with the theory 'hyperglycemic memory'. Further, there is a growing body of evidence that AGEs and their receptor (RAGE) axis is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complication. Indeed, the engagement of RAGE with AGEs is shown to elicit oxidative stress generation and subsequently evoke inflammatory responses in various types of cells, thus playing an important role in the development and progression of diabetic micro- and macroangiopathy. These observations suggest that down-regulation of RAGE expression or blockade of the RAGE downstream signaling may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention in diabetic vascular complication. In this review, we discuss several types of agents that could potentially inhibit RAGE expression or its downstream pathways and their therapeutic implications in diabetic vascular complication.", 
    "11": "It has previously been observed that coronary diameter may increase following relief of flow-limiting obstruction. Flow mediated dilatation (FMD) is a fundamental adaptive mechanism for arteries, which is dependent on intact endothelial function. We thus aimed to characterize whether the degree of this flow-mediated dilatation was related to risk factors, which may impair endothelial function.", 
    "12": "We measured coronary diameter with quantitative angiography before and after relief of chronic total or subtotal (>or=99%) occlusion in 171 patients, in which TIMI-0 or TIMI-1 flow was rapidly restored to TIMI-3 (with attendant increase in flow hypothesized to result in FMD).", 
    "13": "Of the 171 patients, 73% were male, 62% were current or ex-smokers, 47% were diabetic, 53% had hypertension, 64% had dyslipidemia (documented hypercholesterolemia or total cholesterol >5.0 mg/dL) and 65% were taking statin therapy.", 
    "14": "Mean vessel diameter was 2.8 +/- 0.7 mm and flow-mediated dilatation measured 15.1% +/- 20.1% in target vessel, compared with 1.6 +/- 3.1 in control vessels (P < 0.05). FMD was strongly and inversely related to baseline vessel diameter (r = -0.48, P < 0.001). The degree of vessel dilation correlated negatively with the presence of diabetes (r = -0.33, P < 0.001), smoking (r = -0.30, P < 0.001) and extent of coronary artery disease (CAD, r = -0.17, P = 0.01) and positively with the use of statins (r = 0.27, P = 0.001). These factors, apart from extent of CAD, remained significant predictors of FMD on multivariate analysis.", 
    "15": "FMD occurs in human coronary arteries following restoration of flow. The magnitude of FMD appears related to vascular risk factors and their treatment.", 
    "16": "Alterations in brain cholesterol concentration and metabolism seem to be involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, several experimental studies have reported that modification of cholesterol content can influence the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) production. However, it remains to be determined if changes in neuronal cholesterol content may influence the toxicity of Abeta peptides and the mechanism involved. Aged mice, AD patients and neurons exposed to Abeta, show a significant increase in membrane-associated oxidative stress. Since Abeta is able to promote oxidative stress directly by catalytically producing H(2)O(2) from cholesterol, the present work analyzed the effect of high cholesterol incorporated into human neuroblastoma cells in Abeta-mediated neurotoxicity and the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Neuronal viability was studied also in the presence of 24S-hydroxycholesterol, the main cholesterol metabolite in brain, as well as the potential protective role of the lipophilic statin, lovastatin.", 
    "17": "The chemoenzymatic synthesis of the tert-butyl (S)-6-chloro-5-hydroxy-3-ketohexanoate is described. Our approach relies on a highly regio- and enantioselective reduction of a beta,delta-diketohexanoate ester catalysed by NADP(H)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase of Lactobacillus brevis (LBADH). A detailed description of the scale-up of the enzymatic synthesis of the hydroxyketo ester is given which includes a scale-up of the substrate synthesis as well, i.e. the preparation of diketo ester on a 100 g scale. Furthermore, studies directed towards improving the co-catalyst [NADP(H)] consumption of the enzymatic key step by kinetic studies and application of a biphasic reaction medium were performed.", 
    "18": "Statins reduce infarct size by upregulating nitric oxide synthases and PGI2 production. In this article, the infarct size-limiting effect of low-dose simvastatin + ezetimibe, ezetimibe, and high-dose statins were compared. Rats received 3-day water, atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/d), simvastatin (10 mg/kg/d), simvastatin (2 mg/kg/d), simvastatin (2 mg/kg/d) + ezetimibe (1 mg/kg/d), or ezetimibe. Rats underwent 30-minute coronary artery occlusion and 4-hour reperfusion. Atorvastatin and simvastatin 10 reduced infarct size, whereas simvastatin 2, ezetimibe, and simvastatin 2 + ezetimibe had no effect. Atorvastatin and simvastatin 10 increased nitric oxide synthases activity, whereas simvastatin-2, ezetimibe, and simvastatin-2 + ezetimibe had only a small effect. Atorvastatin and simvastatin 10 significantly increased myocardial 6-ketoprostaglandin F(1 alpha) levels, whereas simvastatin 2, ezetimibe, and simvastatin 2 + ezetimibe had no effect. High-dose statin is required to decrease infarct size, upregulate myocardial nitric oxide synthases activities, and increase 6-keto prostaglandin F(1 alpha) levels. Combination of ezetimibe and low-dose statin is ineffective in modulating myocardial biochemical changes associated with cardioprotection.", 
    "19": "Nostoc commune var. sphaeroides K\u00fctzing (N. commune), a blue-green alga, has been used as both a food ingredient and in medicine for centuries. To determine the effect of N. commune on cholesterol metabolism, N. commune lipid extract was incubated at increasing concentrations (25-100 mg/L) with HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. The addition of N. commune lipid extract markedly reduced mRNA abundance of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and LDL receptor (LDLR) (P < 0.05), with a concomitant decrease in their protein expression (P < 0.001). Reduced HMGR activity by 90% with N. commune lipid extract confirmed the inhibitory role of N. commune in cholesterol synthesis (P < 0.006). To elucidate a molecular mechanism underlying the repression of HMGR and LDLR by N. commune lipid extract, expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) was assessed. Whereas mRNA for SREBP-2 remained unchanged, SREBP-2 mature protein was reduced by N. commune (P < 0.009). In addition, N. commune lipid extract also decreased SREBP-1 mature protein by approximately 30% (P < 0.002) and reduced the expression of SREBP-1-responsive genes such as fatty acid synthase and stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) (P < 0.05). Therefore, our results demonstrate that N. commune lipid extract inhibits the maturation process of both SREBP-1 and -2, resulting in a decrease in expression of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism.", 
    "20": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Preliminary evidence suggests a role for global DNA hypomethylation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic complications in CKD. The aims of this study in patients with stage 2-4 CKD were (1) to assess the association between renal function and DNA methylation, (2) to assess the association between DNA methylation and two markers of atherosclerosis [common carotid intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT)] and brachial artery endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated dilatation (BA-FMD) and (3) to examine the effect of a multi-step treatment strategy on DNA methylation.", 
    "21": "In the Anti-Oxidant Therapy In Chronic Renal Insufficiency study (ATIC-study), 93 patients with stage 2-4 CKD were included. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, the treatment group received pravastatin to which vitamin E was added after 6 months and homocysteine-lowering B-vitamin therapy after another 6 months. DNA methylation was assessed using tandem mass spectrometry. CCA-IMT and BA-FMD were assessed using B-mode ultrasonography.", 
    "22": "At baseline, global DNA methylation was not associated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.32) or with CCA-IMT (P = 0.62) or BA-FMD (P = 0.51). No effect of the treatment strategy including B-vitamin on global DNA methylation was found either in the total study group or within separate strata of homocysteine concentration and renal function.", 
    "23": "In patients with stage 2-4 CKD, global DNA methylation is not associated with renal function or with CCA-IMT or BA-FMD. A treatment strategy that includes B-vitamins did not alter global DNA methylation in these patients. These data do not support the role of DNA hypomethylation in CKD-associated vascular disease in patients with stage 2-4 CKD.", 
    "24": "Regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CCN2/CTGF) in gingival fibroblasts is unique and may provide therapeutic opportunities to treat oral fibrotic diseases. RhoA was previously implicated in mediating the expression of CCN2/CTGF. We now present evidence that Rho family GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 are the principal mediators of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1)-stimulated expression of CCN2/CTGF in primary human gingival fibroblasts. TGFbeta1 does not stimulate RhoA activation in gingival fibroblasts, and the overexpression of dominant-negative RhoA does not reduce CCN2/CTGF expression in response to TGFbeta1. In contrast, the overexpression of dominant-negative forms of Cdc42 or Rac1 results in a dramatic reduction of CCN2/CTGF protein levels. Lovastatin and a geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor reduce the TGFbeta1-stimulated levels of CCN2/CTGF protein by approximately 75 and 100%, respectively. We previously demonstrated that JNK1 phosphorylation by TGFbeta1 is also critical for TGFbeta1-induced CCN2/CTGF expression, and forskolin partially reduces levels of phosphorylated JNK1. Inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferase has no effect on levels of JNK phosphorylation in response to TGFbeta1 suggesting Rho-GTPases act independently of JNK1. The combination of lovastatin and forskolin results in a greater inhibitory effect than each agent alone and reduces CCN2/CTGF mRNA and protein expression by greater than 90%. This novel combination has additive inhibitory effects on the TGFbeta1-stimulated expression of CCN2/CTGF in human gingival fibroblasts through the simultaneous disruption of Rho- and JNK1-mediated pathways, respectively. This combination of available therapeutic compounds may therefore be useful in designing treatment strategies for oral fibrotic conditions in which gingival CCN2/CTGF is elevated.", 
    "25": "Lymphocytes possess all the components required to constitute an independent, non-neuronal cholinergic system. These include acetylcholine (ACh); choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), its synthesizing enzyme; and both muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors (mAChRs and nAChRs, respectively). ACh modifies T and B cell function via both mAChR- and nAChR-mediated pathways. Stimulation of lymphocytes with the T cell activator phytohemagglutinin, protein kinase C activator phorbol ester, or cell surface molecules enhances the synthesis and release of ACh and up-regulates ChAT and/or M(5) mAChR gene expression. Furthermore, animal models of immune disorders exhibit abnormal lymphocytic cholinergic activity. The cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin attenuates the lymphocytic cholinergic activity of T cells by inhibiting LFA-1 signaling in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. This suggests that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part by modifying lymphocytic cholinergic activity. Nicotine, an active ingredient of tobacco, ameliorates ulcerative colitis but exacerbates Crohn's disease. Expression of mRNAs encoding the nAChR alpha7 and alpha5 subunits are significantly diminished in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes from smokers, as compared with those from nonsmokers. In addition, long-term exposure of lymphocytes to nicotine reduces intracellular Ca(2+) signaling via alpha7 nAChR-mediated pathways. In fact, studies of humoral antibody production in M(1)/M(5) mAChR-deficient and alpha7 nAChR-deficient animals revealed the role of lymphocytic cholinergic activity in the regulation of immune function. These results provide clues to understanding the mechanisms underlying immune system regulation and could serve as the basis for the development of new immunomodulatory drugs.", 
    "26": "Increasing evidence suggests that hypercholesterolemia during pregnancy initiates pathogenic events in the fetus leading to increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the adult offspring. In this study we examined in mice whether pharmacological intervention using statins in late pregnancy could alleviate the detrimental effects of a high-fat, high-cholesterol (45% fat) maternal diet on the health of the dams and their offspring. Pregnant C57 mice on high-fat, high-cholesterol diet were given the 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin in the drinking water (5 mg/kg of body weight per day) in the second half of pregnancy and during lactation to lower cholesterol and improve postweaning maternal blood pressure. Weaned offspring were then fed the high-fat, high-cholesterol diet until adulthood (generating dam/offspring dietary groups high-fat, high-cholesterol/high-fat, high-cholesterol and high-fat, high-cholesterol plus pravastatin during the second half of pregnancy and lactation/high-fat, high-cholesterol). These groups were compared with offspring from mothers fed standard chow (control), which were then fed control diet to adulthood (control/control). Compared with high-fat, high-cholesterol, high-fat, high-cholesterol plus pravastatin during second half of pregnancy and lactation dams showed significantly reduced total cholesterol concentrations and reduced systolic blood pressure. The high-fat, high-cholesterol plus pravastatin during second half of pregnancy and lactation/high-fat, high-cholesterol offspring were significantly lighter, less hypertensive, and more active compared with the high-fat, high-cholesterol/high-fat, high-cholesterol group. Total serum and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were raised in high-fat, high-cholesterol plus pravastatin during the second half of pregnancy and lactation/high-fat, high-cholesterol offspring, compared with the high-fat, high-cholesterol/high-fat, high-cholesterol group. The control/control offspring showed the lowest blood pressure and cholesterol levels. These findings indicate that the cholesterol-lowering effect of statins in pregnant dams consuming a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet leads to reduced cardiovascular risk factors in offspring that are sustained into adulthood.", 
    "27": "Effective therapies for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease-related events are significantly underused, and attempts to improve adherence have often yielded disappointing results. Elimination of patient out-of-pocket costs may be an effective strategy to enhance medication use. We sought to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing full coverage for aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins (combination pharmacotherapy) to individuals enrolled in the Medicare drug benefit program after acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "28": "We created a Markov cost-effectiveness model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing Medicare beneficiaries with full coverage for combination pharmacotherapy compared with current coverage under the Medicare Part D program. Our analysis was conducted from the societal perspective and considered a lifetime time horizon. In a sensitivity analysis, we repeated our analysis from the perspective of Medicare. In the model, post-myocardial infarction Medicare beneficiaries who received usual prescription drug coverage under the Part D program lived an average of 8.21 quality-adjusted life-years after their initial event, incurring coronary heart disease-related medical costs of $114,000. Those who received prescription drug coverage without deductibles or copayments lived an average of 8.56 quality-adjusted life-years and incurred $111,600 in coronary heart disease-related costs. Compared with current prescription drug coverage, full coverage for post-myocardial infarction secondary prevention therapies would result in greater functional life expectancy (0.35 quality-adjusted life-year) and less resource use ($2500). From the perspective of Medicare, full drug coverage was highly cost-effective ($7182/quality-adjusted life-year) but not cost saving.",

    "32": "We performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated with EOD rosuvastatin at 2 lipid specialty clinics: the University of Kansas Lipid, Atherosclerosis, and LDL-Apheresis Center and the Hartford Hospital Cholesterol Management Center. Approximately 2600 charts were reviewed to identify patients receiving rosuvastatin EOD who previously had experienced statin intolerance. Fifty-one patients were eligible for the analysis, which evaluated changes in the lipid profile, the number achieving their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals, and the percent tolerating rosuvastatin EOD. Laboratory data were assessed immediately prior to rosuvastatin EOD therapy and at the first follow-up.", 
    "33": "Myalgias (76.5%) and increased transaminase levels (19.5%) were the most common causes of prior statin intolerance, but 72.5% (37/51) of patients were able to tolerate the EOD therapy (mean dose 5.6 mg) regimen for 4 +/- 2.9 (mean +/- SD) months. Mean LDL-C decreased 34.5% (p < 0.001) in the patients who tolerated the regimen, enabling approximately 50% to achieve their LDL-C goal. All patients who were considered to be intolerant to rosuvastatin EOD therapy (27.5%; 14/51) re-experienced the symptoms of their prior statin intolerance.", 
    "34": "Treating patients intolerant to statins with rosuvastatin EOD was tolerated by the majority of patients and reduced LDL-C in our study.

    "35": "Amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis is a severe complication of many chronic inflammatory disorders, including the hereditary periodic fever syndromes. However, in one of these periodic fever syndromes, the hyper IgD and periodic fever syndrome, amyloidosis is rare despite vigorous, recurring inflammation. This hereditary syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene coding for mevalonate kinase, an enzyme of the isoprenoid pathway. In this study, we used a cell culture system with human monocytes to show that inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway inhibits amyloidogenesis. Inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway by lovastatin resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of amyloid formed [53% at 10 microM (P=0.01)] compared with mononuclear cells that are exposed only to serum AA. The inhibitory effects of lovastatin are reversible by addition of farnesol but not geranylgeraniol. Farnesyl transferase inhibition also inhibited amyloidogenesis. These results implicate that the isoprenoid metabolism could be a potential target for prevention and treatment of AA amyloidosis.",

Cell activation based upon production of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 cytokines was analyzed and the intracellular Raf-MEK-ERK signal transduction pathway was evaluated using western blot analysis, to identify its role in cell activation and in any cerivastatin effects observed.", 
    "38": "We found that pretreatment with cerivastatin significantly abrogates the production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and MCP-1 by human monocytes in response to polymethylmethacrylate particle activation. This inflammatory activation and attenuation appear to be mediated through the intracellular Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.",

In order to establish whether statin drugs could affect an aquatic species, we initially characterized in the rainbow trout the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase or HMGCoAR which is the mammalian target of statin drugs. Two HMGCoAR transcripts (-1 and -2) were isolated to trout tissues and given their prevalence in liver and brain, these two tissues were used in activity assays. HMGCoAR activities were 87.2 and 66.0 pmol/min/mg protein for liver microsomes and whole brain homogenates. Liver activities were affected by conditions promoting phosphorylation but not by a 14 day fast; brain activities were differentially altered by fasting and re-feeding. Even though activities were altered by fasting, HMGCoAR-1 (but not -2) mRNA was reduced by fasting in both the liver and hypothalamus/pituitary. Both statin drugs (cerivastatin and atorvastatin) significantly decreased HMGCoAR activities in vitro and cerivastatin when injected significantly decreased hepatic but not brain activities; some changes in mRNA levels were noted. These studies demonstrate that at the concentrations of statins used in this study, effects on HMGCoAR activities and transcripts occur. Such changes could affect cholesterol content and may alter cholesterol dynamics in this species.",

However, after adjusting for clinical and echocardiographic variables, low Hb levels did not independently predict absence of SEC.

We investigated the genotype effects of IL-6 -174 and -572 polymorphisms on circulating levels of inflammatory markers in Korean men with coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD patients were subdivided into 2 groups; those patients treated without lipid-lowering drug (LLD) (n = 173) and those treated with LLD (n = 353). No significant differences existed between the 2 groups in age, body mass index, blood pressure, serum glucose, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and the proportions of antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapies. IL-6 - 572 C>G polymorphism was only observed in this population. In CAD patients not taking LLD, the G/G genotype of the -572C>G polymorphism was associated with greater concentrations of IL-6 (C/C: 4.1 +/- 0.8 pg/mL, C/G: 3.7 +/- 0.7, G/G: 12.4 +/- 6.6; P = 0.031), C-reactive protein (CRP) (C/C: 1.9 +/- 0.4 mg/dL, C/G: 2.7 +/- 0.8, G/G: 10.1 +/- 3.9; P = 0.002), fibrinogen (C/C: 334 +/- 6 mg/dL, C/G: 345 +/- 13, G/G: 429 +/- 38; P = 0.003), and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) (C/C: 59 +/- 2 mg/dL, C/G: 55 +/- 3, G/G: 71 +/- 6; P = 0.041) than those with C/C or C/G. However, in the LLD group, no difference existed in circulating levels of IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, and ox-LDL across the genotype after adjustment of age. This study suggests that circulating levels of IL-6 and its related proteins such as CRP and fibrinogen are associated with genotype at a promoter polymorphism (-572C>G) of the IL-6 gene in Korean men with CAD not taking LLD. LLD, mostly statin in this study, might reduce the exaggeration of G/G genotype-raising effect on inflammatory markers.",

In addition, both Abeta and HIV-1 are known to induce cellular oxidative stress and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Therefore, we hypothesize that Abeta and HIV-1 protein Tat can potentiate their proinflammatory effects at the brain endothelium level. To address this hypothesis, we studied promoter activity of three proinflammatory genes in an in vitro BBB model of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) cocultured with a human astrocyte cell line producing Tat (SVGA-Tat cells) and exposed to Abeta. Treatment of HBMEC with Abeta(1-40) in the presence of SVGA-Tat cells resulted in a significant up-regulation of E-selectin, CC chemokine ligand-2, and interleukin-6 promoter activities and protein levels compared with the individual effects of Abeta or Tat. In addition, Abeta markedly amplified E-selectin promoter activity in HBMEC cocultured with HIV-1-infected Jurkat T cells. Simvastatin, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, effectively blocked proinflammatory reactions induced by Abeta in cocultures with SVGA-Tat cells or with HIV-1-infected Jurkat cells. The present study indicates that a combined exposure to Abeta and Tat or HIV-1 can synergistically potentiate the expression of inflammatory genes in brain endothelial cells. In addition, simvastatin may provide a beneficial influence by reducing these effects at the BBB level.",

Given their pleiotropic effects related to many pathophysiological determinants of sepsis, statin therapy could be the next step in the search for adjuvant therapy.

    "73": "Chronic complications of type 2 diabetes, in particular, macrovascular complications, confer substantial morbidity and mortality and adversely affect a patient's quality of life. Early intensive intervention to control cardiovascular risk factors is essential in clinical management. Atherogenic dyslipidaemia characterized by elevated triglycerides, a low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and an increase in the preponderance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, is a key modifiable risk factor for macrovascular diabetic complications. Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with a statin (or the combination of statin and ezetimibe) is the main focus for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. However, statins fail to address the residual cardiovascular risk associated with low HDL-C. Fibrates are effective against all components of the atherogenic dyslipidaemia associated with type 2 diabetes. Secondary analyses of the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study suggest a role for early treatment with fenofibrate in improving cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes and provide safety data supporting the use of fenofibrate in combination with a statin. Data from the FIELD study suggest that fenofibrate may also have potential to impact on microvascular diabetic complications associated with type 2 diabetes. Data are awaited from the ongoing Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study to evaluate the outcome benefits of combining fenofibrate with a statin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Finally, in view of divergent study results and outstanding data, assessment of the risk of the individual with type 2 diabetes is mandatory to assist clinical decision-making when initiating lipid therapy.",

Although magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) scan are emerging as a powerful noninvasive tool for characterization of aortic atheromas, TEE is the imaging modality of choice. Currently, treatment of aortic atheromas is not well defined, and mixed outcomes have been reported for anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.

The protective association between statins and sepsis persisted in high-risk subgroups including patients with diabetes mellitus, those with malignancy, and those receiving steroids. This review discusses the basis of these observations and the current place of statin therapy in patients with sepsis. This is a rapidly growing field of fascinating experimental biology. It suggests an urgent need to investigate the pharmacology of these drugs and reappraise their therapeutic indications in critically ill patients. If this finding is supported by prospective controlled trials, statins may play an important role in sepsis related mortality. By the other hand statins are significantly cheaper than other therapies that have been shown to improve outcome in sepsis, and the demonstration of mortality benefit would have enormous cost-benefit implication.",

However, their action mechanism(s) in Abeta precursor protein (APP) processing and Abeta generation is not fully understood. In this study, we report that lovastatin treatment reduced Abeta output in cultured hippocampal neurons as a result of reduced APP levels and beta-secretase activities in low density Lubrol WX (non-ionic detergent) extractable lipid rafts (LDLR). Rather than altering cholesterol levels in lipid raft fractions and thus disrupting lipid raft structure, lovastatin decreased Abeta generation through down-regulating geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate dependent endocytosis pathway. The inhibition of APP endocytosis by treatment with lovastatin and reduction of APP levels in LDLR fractions by treatment with phenylarsine oxide (a general endocytosis inhibitor) support the involvement of APP endocytosis in APP distribution in LDLR fractions and subsequent APP beta-cleavage. Moreover, lovastatin-mediated down-regulation of endocytosis regulators, such as early endosomal antigen 1, dynamin-1, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, indicates that lovastatin modulates APP endocytosis possibly through its pleiotropic effects on endocytic regulators. Collectively, these data report that lovastatin mediates inhibition of LDLR distribution and beta-cleavage of APP in a geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate and endocytosis-dependent manner.",

Eze/Simva 10/40 mg also produced significantly lower total cholesterol (-0.49 mmol/l), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [(non-HDL-C); -0.53 mmol/l] and apolipoprotein B (-0.14 mmol/l) values compared with doubling the statin dose (p </= 0.001 for all). Both treatments produced similar effects on triglycerides, C-reactive protein and HDL-C; the between treatment group differences were not significant (p >/= 0.160). Significantly more patients achieved LDL-C levels < 2.5 (< 100 mg/dl; 86% vs. 72%), < 2.0 (< 77 mg/dl; 70% vs. 42%) and < 1.8 mmol/l (< 70 mg/dl; 60% vs. 31%) with Eze/Simva than statin (all p </= 0.001).

The primary target for the prevention of coronary diseases is a reduction of LDL-cholesterol because that reduces the cardiovascular mortality and the total mortality. The NCEP ATP III 2004 guide-lines propose as therapeutic target for the high-risk patients the reduction of plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol under 100 mg/dl and according to new trials under 70 mg/dl. The dyslipidaemia treatments are based on two approaches, i.e., the therapeutic lifestyle change and the pharmacological therapy. The available drugs are statins, fibrates, anion exchange resins, nicotinic acid. In the acute coronary syndrome patients is desirable to start immediately a therapy with statins since the hospital phase and direct the treatment to aggressive therapy. Unfortunately, the statin doses used in the most secondary prevention trials allow to get LDL-cholesterol under 100 mg/dl in the only half high-risk patients. The innovative therapeutic approach to hypercholesterolemia today is based on a double inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and absorption combining a statin with ezetimibe.",

Almost all patients with type 1 diabetes will develop retinopathy over a 15- to 20-year period, and approximately 20-30% will advance to the blinding stage of the disease[1]. Greater than 60% of patients with type 2 diabetes will have retinopathy. This situation is highlighted by the frightening statistic that diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the most common cause of vision impairment in people of working age in Western society. With the global epidemic of type 2 diabetes, this predicament is set to worsen as over 360 million people are projected to suffer from diabetes and its complications by 2030. Vision loss from diabetes is due to a number of factors, including haemorrhage from new and poorly formed blood vessels, retinal detachment due to contraction of deposited fibrous tissue, and neovascular glaucoma resulting in an increase in intraocular pressure. Diabetic macular oedema is now the principal cause of vision loss in diabetes and involves leakage from a disrupted blood-retinal barrier. In terms of treatment, there is clear evidence that strict metabolic and blood pressure control can lower the risk of developing DR and reduce disease progression. Laser photocoagulation and vitrectomy are effective in preventing severe vision loss in DR, particularly in the most advanced stages of the disease. However, both procedures have limitations. This review examines evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that shows that targeting inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system, vascular endothelial growth factor, corticosteroids, protein kinase C, growth hormone, and advanced glycation end-products are potential treatments for DR.",

Safety monitoring was analysed by chart review of a separate group of 50 patients attending rheumatology clinics on long-term prophylactic colchicine and with renal impairment (creatinine > or = 0.17 mmol/L or creatinine clearance < or =0.83 ml/sec). Monitoring of creatine kinase (CK) and full blood count (FBC) was compared with published quality of care indicators regarding safety monitoring of colchicine.

On the contrary, inhibition of platelet aggregation by simvastatin was markedly attenuated (by about 50%) by addition of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, a NO scavenger or a NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase inhibitor. The anti-aggregatory effects of simvastatin were significantly increased by addition of a selective inhibitor of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase.",

Inflammation plays a role in determining the serum albumin levels in haemodialysis patients (HD) independently of the nutritional status. Increased cardiovascular mortality in CKD has been associated with the increased incidence of obesity in uremic patients. Ingenbleek suggested a prognostic inflammation and nutritional index (PINI), based on serum albumin, pre-albumin, C-reactive protein, and alpha1 acid glycoprotein, to identify and to follow up acutely ill patients at risk of major complications. The aims of the present study were: to verify the incidence of Normal Weight Obese (NWO) syndrome; to evaluate by PINI the effect of 8 weeks acetyl salicylic (100 mg/die) and atorvastatin (10 mg/die) combined treatment on chronic inflammation in 52 selected HD patients. Laboratory evaluation, anthropometric and body composition measurements were detected. At baseline the 56.25% of non-obese, the 84.21% of pre-obese-obese, and the 41.17% of NWO women showed PINI values >1 (normal status PINI<1). After the pharmacological treatment, high significant (P<0.001) reduction in lipid profile, an elevated increase of HDL levels, and a significant reduction of inflammatory markers were obtained. Firstly, our results showed that ASA and atorvastatin combined treatment was effective in reducing inflammatory status in HD patients independently of body composition: at the end of the study only 7.49% of the patients exhibited PINI>1. Further studies will be necessary to understand the causes of inflammation in non-responder patients.",

Our objective was to examine two PCSK9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), R46L and E670G, in 5783 elderly participants in Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER), of whom 43% had a history of vascular disease at baseline, and who were randomized to pravastatin or placebo with followup. In this population 3.5% were carriers of the T allele at R46L, and these subjects had significantly (p<0.001) lower levels of LDL C (mean, -10%), no difference in LDL C lowering response to pravastatin, and a non-significant 19% unadjusted and 9% adjusted decreased risk of vascular disease at baseline, with no on trial effect. Moreover, 6.0% were carriers of the G allele at E670G with no significant relationships with baseline LDL C, response to pravastatin, or vascular disease risk being observed.

Although the clinical presentation of MGTA is mainly characterized by neurological symptoms, the mechanisms of brain damage in this disease are poorly known. In the present study we investigated the in vitro effect of MGT, MGA and OHIVA on various parameters of oxidative stress in cerebral cortex from young rats. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS) and chemiluminescence were significantly increased by MGT, MGA and OHIVA, indicating that these metabolites induce lipid oxidative damage. Furthermore, the addition of melatonin, alpha-tocopherol and superoxide dismutase plus catalase fully prevented MGT-induced increase on TBA-RS, suggesting that free radicals were involved in this effect. These metabolites also provoked protein oxidative damage determined by increased carbonyl formation and sulfhydryl oxidation, but did not induce superoxide generation in submitochondrial particles. It was also verified that MGA and MGT significantly decreased the non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses in cerebral cortex supernatants and that melatonin and alpha-tocopherol totally blocked MGA-induced GSH reduction. The data indicate that the metabolites accumulating in MGTA elicit oxidative stress in vitro in the cerebral cortex. It is therefore presumed that this pathomechanism may be involved in the brain damage observed in patients affected by MGTA.",

For the LDLR SNPs C44857T and A44964G we noted significant associations of the rare alleles with baseline LDL-C and triglyceride levels, a modest association of the C44857T with LDL-C lowering to pravastatin in men, and significant associations with incident CHD and CVD of both SNPs, especially in men on pravastatin.

Endothelial function was measured as flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) by high resolution ultrasound. Valsartan (Diovan) and Fluvastatin (Lescol XL) were provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland).", 
    "160": "Combination of F (80 mg o.d) with initial therapy by V (160 mg o.d.) led to more significant decrement of BP and significant improvement of FMD.", 
    "161": "We studied the influence of rosuvastatin therapy and myocardial revascularization on angiogenic growth factors in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Two main groups were examined: the first one consisted of patients passed through successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the second one consisted of patients on 3 months rosuvastatin therapy. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor Flt-1 (sVEGF-Rl) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-bl) levels were measured in healthy volunteers and CAD patients before and 6 days after myocardial revascularization by PCI. VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) levels were measured before and 3 month after rosuvastatin therapy, as well as total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and endothelium dependent vasodilation. VEGF levels did not differ, but TGF - b levels were significantly lower in CAD patients compared to healthy subjects (11.0 +/- 4.9 pg/ml and 120.0 +/- 32.4 pg/ml, respectively, p < 0.000l). Myocardial revascularization caused changes in VEGF levels from 192.4 +/- 166.1 pg/ml to 264.7 +/- 226.6 pg/ml (p=0.0066) without significant influence on TGF and VEGF-R1 levels in 6 days. There were positive changes in lipid levels, lowering of CRP and IL-6 concentrations, improvement of endothelial function and decrease of VEGF levels from 382 +/- 249 pg/ml to 297 +/- 220 pg/ml (p=0.006) 3 month after start of rosuvastatin treatment (no changes in bFGF levels were observed). Chronic insufficient myocardial blood supply leads to decreasing of TGF - b levels. The elevation of VEGF after myocardial revascularization reflects transient ischemia and potentially may provoke hemodynamic instability, caused by atherosclerotic plaque neovascularization. Strengthening of statin therapy early after myocardial revascularization may allow to stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque condition, also by means of VEGF lowering.", 
    "162": "The aim of our study was to assess the influence of rosuvastatin on coronary angiogenesis. 30 male patients with chronic coronary heart disease and total cholesterol level > 5.2 mmol/l were treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg daily during 3 months. The serum level of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG) as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) were measured initially and in 3 months. There was the significant decreasing of TC, LDL-C and TG concentrations. IL-6 and CRP serum levels were also decreased after rosuvastatin therapy. Three months of treatment resulted to significant decrease of VEGF with no changes of bFGF levels. The correlation was not found between CRP and VEGF levels and between IL-6 and VEGF levels. Also there was no correlation between the degree of decreasing CRP and VEGF, and IL-6 and VEGF. So we have shown significant decreasing of VEGF serum levels on rosuvastatin therapy. It could be possible mechanism of plaque stabilization in patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "163": "In 101 patients with ischemic heart disease (unstable angina class I and II-III) with hypercholesterolemia at the background of standard therapy (51 patients) and after administration of atorvastatin (50 persons) prescribed from first day of hospitalization in mean dose 10.8 +/- 0.1 mg/day immune status was studied in accordance with 3 stage scheme of examination. In dynamics (before onset of treatment and after 6 months of therapy) a concentrations of a row of cytokines was studied: alpha-factor of tumor necrosis (TNFalpha) and C-reactive protein (CRP). At correlation analysis of parameters of plasma lipid composition and immune profile it has been established that in patients with unstable angina (in the presence of hypercholesterolemia) together with elevation of CRP level substantial signs of dysbalance in immune system are observed. These signs appear as elevation of levels of TNFalpha, interleukin-4, and especially interferon gamma with simultaneous depression of cells of immune defense. In has been demonstrated that atorvastatin not only exerts good hypolipidemic effect, but is capable to diminish immunoinflammatory shifts in patients with acute coronary pathology.", 
    "164": "To study clinico-diagnostic significance of cytokine activation, changes of levels of inflammatory cytokines in blood serum and main morphofunctional parameters of the heart in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) of ischemic origin at the background of therapy with simvastatin.", 
    "165": "We examined 140 patients including 110 patients with clinical signs of I - IV functional class (FC) CHF and 30 healthy volunteers (control group). Standard transthoracic echocardiography was carried out in all patients at admission, in 3 and 6 months of follow up. Blood serum levels of cytokines 1beta, 6, 8 (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) were measured by solid phase immunoenzyme analysis at admission, on day 20, and in 3 and 6 months of follow up. The patients were randomized into 2 groups. Main group (n=60) consisted of patients who for 6 months in addition to basic therapy received simvastatin. Patients of comparison group (n=50) received standard therapy.", 
    "166": "In patients with CHF elevation of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8) in blood serum was established. It progressed with growth of severity of CHF with maximal level of their elevation in patients with FC IV and in patients with unfavorable clinical outcome of the disease. At the background of therapy with simvastatin we noted significant lowering of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8) in blood serum irrespective of level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, betterment of functional state of the left ventricle, positive clinical dynamics of CHF.", 
    "167": "We studied effect of atorvastatin on secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA (sPLA2-IIA) in blood serum of patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), lipid composition of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and process of modification of LDL induced by sPLA2-IIA in 20 patients taking 20 mg/day of atorvastatin for 3 months. In patients with initially high level of sPLA2-IIA ( > 8 mcg/l) its concentration significantly decreased. Amount of total cholesterol, triglyceride, lecithin, and lysolecithin remained unchanged, however in equimolar relations there occurred decrease of amount of total cholesterol and increase of cholesterol esters. At incubation of LDL, extracted from patient s plasma before initiation of the study, with human sPLA2-IIA from cardiac myxoma, 3.5 nmol of lysolecithin per 1 mg of LDL protein was formed while at incubation of LDL of same patients, extracted after 3 months of atorvastatin administration, amount of lysolecithin was 1.54 nmol/mg LDL protein. Thus atorvastatin therapy causes lowering of sPLA2-IIA in patients with initially high blood level of the enzyme and to a great extent precludes sPLA2-IIA induced LDL modification.", 
    "168": "Relationship between disorders of endothelial function, proinflammatory activity of leucocytes and effects of therapy with simvastatin or its combination with ezetimibe was studied in 72 patients with ischemic heart disease subjected to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Vascular endothelial function was assessed by ultrasound detection of brachial artery response to its compression, oxidant activity of leucocytes - by chemiluminescent microscopy, severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis - by invasive coronary angiography. Twenty two healthy individuals comprised control group. Endothelial function, activity of leucocytes, and lipid levels were evaluated before and in 12 months after CABG. Patients with multivessel involvement revealed more complex disorders of endothelial function and higher levels of leucocytes activity compared to patients with single-vessel disease. CABG resulted in disappearance of anginal attacks and negative stress echo test during 1-year observation in 80.6% of patients. Patients with recurrent angina after CABG had more severe endothelial and leucocytes disorders. Combined lipid lowering therapy (simvastatin plus ezetimibe) compared to simvastatin alone demonstrated higher efficacy in terms of achievement of target lipid levels, improvement of endothelial function and leucocytes disorders.", 
    "169": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering agent, on the Akt-mediated signaling pathway and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus in rats after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Adult male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: (1) sham group (n = 8); (2) saline control group (n = 40); and (3) simvastatin-treated group (n = 40). Controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury was performed over the left parietal lobe. Simvastatin was administered orally at a dose of 1 mg/kg starting at day 1 after TBI and then daily for 14 days. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected intraperitoneally into rats. A modified Morris Water Maze (WM) task was performed between 31 and 35 days after treatment to test spatial memory (n = 8/group). Animals were sacrificed at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 35 days after treatment (n = 8/group/time point). Western blot was utilized to investigate the changes in the Akt-mediated signaling pathway. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses were employed to measure vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) expression. Immunohistochemical and fluorescent staining were performed to detect the BrdU- and neuronal nuclei (NeuN)/BrdU-positive cells. Our data show that simvastatin treatment increases phosphorylation of v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), and cAMP response element-binding proteins (CREB); elevates the expression of BDNF and VEGF in the DG; increases cell proliferation and differentiation in the DG; and enhances the recovery of spatial learning. These data suggest that the neurorestorative effect of simvastatin may be mediated through activation of the Akt-mediated signaling pathway, subsequently upregulating expression of growth factors and inducing neurogenesis in the DG of the hippocampus, thereby leading to restoration of cognitive function after TBI in rats.", 
    "170": "The endothelium-dependent dilation of skeletal muscle arterioles is mediated by factors that have not been identified in young rats, and partly mediated by an unidentified hyperpolarizing factor in maturing rats. This study was designed to determine if endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contributes to this arteriolar dilation at either of these growth stages.", 
    "171": "Gracilis muscle arterioles were isolated from rats at ages 24-26 days (\"weanlings\") and 46-48 days (\"juveniles\"). We investigated the effects of catalase treatment on the endothelium-dependent dilation of these vessels to simvastatin and acetylcholine (ACh). Catalase-sensitive 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence also was measured as an index of H2O2 formation, and arteriolar dilation to exogenous H2O2 was pharmacologically probed in each age group.", 
    "172": "Responses to simvastatin and ACh were attenuated by catalase in juvenile, but not weanling, arterioles. Juvenile, but not weanling, arterioles also displayed catalase-sensitive DCF fluorescence that was increased by ACh. Exogenous H2O2 could induce dilation in juvenile, but not weanling, arterioles. In juvenile arterioles, this dilation was abolished by the K+ channel inhibitors TEA and glibenclamide, and attenuated by NOS inhibition or endothelial removal.", 
    "173": "These findings suggest that endogenous H2O2 contributes to endothelium-dependent arteriolar dilation in juvenile rats, but not in younger rats, and that H2O2 acts in juvenile rats by stimulating endothelial NO release and activating smooth muscle K+ channels.", 
    "174": "Statins are widely used to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but less so in patients without CAD. We reviewed recent trials for new evidence for the reduction in risk of stroke.", 
    "175": "In patients with CAD, moderate-intensity statin treatment has been associated with reductions in risk of stroke, with no increase in hemorrhagic stroke. Additionally, in the TNT trial, intensive lipid lowering provided further stroke risk reduction compared with moderate lipid lowering in patients with stable CAD. Evidence is now available that statin therapy also reduces stroke risk in patients without CAD but at high cardiovascular risk, or with diabetes mellitus. The SPARCL trial showed that intensive statin therapy started within 6 months after a cerebrovascular event significantly reduced stroke risk and stroke severity. Low cholesterol levels have been associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke, but although an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke was observed in patients with prior hemorrhagic stroke in SPARCL, this was not related to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Clinical trials have recruited few patients with both coronary and cerebrovascular disease, but these patients are also expected to experience significant cardiovascular benefit with statin therapy.", 
    "176": "Trial data show that statins reduce the risk of stroke, in addition to providing cardiovascular benefits. Consequently, physicians should consider statin therapy in all patients at high risk of stroke.", 
    "177": "The author summarizes the evidences of angina pectoris' optimal treatment. The invasive treatment strategy became a frontrunner in this field as well. During the last years the number of percutaneous interventions became higher than bypass operations in many countries as well as in Hungary. The place of percutaneous interventions and bypass surgery in the treatment of angina pectoris is an important clinical problem. The author summarizes the data of three possible treatment options (medical therapy, percutaneous interventions and bypass surgery) of angina pectoris based on data of randomised trials. The evidences show that the first steps of therapy are - after the diagnosis - the influence of risk factors, life-style changes and optimal medical therapy. The optimal medical therapy consists of statin, aspirin and ACE inhibitor treatment besides antianginal therapy, where the beta blockers are regarded as first drugs of choice. Percutaneous interventions as initial treatment option are not recommended because we have no evidences that this intervention prolongs life and prevents myocardial infarction. If the patient remains symptomatic after medical treatment, it is necessary to perform revascularization. These procedures can improve the functional capacity more than medical treatment alone. The optimal treatment strategy of angina pectoris, based on evidence, is an important medical and economical problem."
