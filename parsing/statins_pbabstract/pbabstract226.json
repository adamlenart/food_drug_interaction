The author describes the case of a white man, aged 51 years, with T2DM that was diagnosed 3 years earlier. The patient was obese and had a history of chronic low back pain. He also had diagnosed hypertension, decreased vibratory sensation in the feet, an S4 atrial gallop, trace ankle edema, degenerative joint disease in the knees, and decreased range of motion in the lumbar spine. Other findings at the patient's initial visit included hyperglycemia, microalbuminuria, and lipid abnormalities. Initial treatment included metformin; a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (naproxen); a thiazolidinedione (rosiglitazone maleate); a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide); an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril); and low-dose aspirin. At 6-month follow-up, the patient continued to have elevated glycosylated hemoglobin, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and excess weight. Additional treatment strategies consisted of pioglitazone hydrochloride; metformin in combination with the dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor sitagliptin phosphate; a statin (atorvastatin hydrochloride); and enrollment in a diet and exercise program. Results at 12-month follow-up included a substantial decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin and improved hypertension and dyslipidemia. The patient was successfully treated across the full range of global cardiovascular risk reduction.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of high plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels on renal structure and the effects of atorvastatin on progression-regression of renal injury. One-hundred chickens were divided into five groups: Group A: Standard diet (SD) for 6 months; Group B: Hyperlipidemic diet (HD) for 6 months; Group C: HD for three months and SD during the next 3 months; Group D: HD for 3 months and SD during the next 3 months, when they received oral atorvastatin (3 mg/kg/d); Group E: HD for the whole 6 months, and atorvastatin (3 mg/kg/d) during the last 3 months. Increased alpha-actine immunostaining was found in glomeruli of groups B and C. An important decrease of immunostaining was observed in glomeruli of atorvastatin treated groups. Group D showed the lowest value for presence of lipids, and significant differences were found with respect to the rest of the groups. The glomeruli of group B presented the highest damage grades and those of group D showed the lowest grades and presented significant differences from the rest of the groups. The combination of atorvastatin therapy and proper diet proved to be effective in promoting renal disease regression.

    "6": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been shown to directly induce neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) proliferation, a major component involved in cardiac hypertrophy. Herein, we explored whether AVP is also a growth factor for adult rat CFs and, if so, whether the growth effect could be inhibited by simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. AVP significantly increased DNA synthesis in adult rat CFs by 73.5 +/- 5.1% (P < or = 0.05), an effect inhibited by V1 receptor antagonist, d(CH(2))(5)[Tyr(2)(Me), Arg(8)]-vasopressin. AVP also activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) as assessed by MBP phosphotransferase activity (5.1 +/- 0.6 fold over basal level, P < or = 0.05) and Western blot analysis, and effects were mimicked by protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), but abolished by inhibiting cellular PKC through chronic PMA incubation. In addition, AVP induced PKC activation (27.2 +/- 3.8% from a basal value of 9.3 +/- 0.7%, P < or = 0.05). AVP-induced increase in DNA synthesis could be attenuated by the specific inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059), PI3K (LY294002), and AKT (1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, HIMO). Simvastatin inhibited the effects of AVP on DNA synthesis, ERK1/2, and PKC activation in a dose-dependent manner. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent AKT activation induced by AVP was also inhibited by simvastatin. The effects of simvastatin on ERK1/2, PKC, and AKT activation and DNA synthesis could be reversed by mevalonate. These results support a growth-inducing effect of AVP on adult rat CFs through ERK and AKT signalings and the growth effect could be attenuated by simvastatin via inhibiting these two pathways.",

Baseline atherosclerotic plaques were defined as uncomplicated (between 1 and 3.9 mm) and complicated aortic plaques (>or=4 mm). To minimize sub-millimetre errors in plaque evolution, AA progression was defined as an increase in maximal plaque thickness>or=1 mm. Similarly, regression was defined as a decrease in maximal thickness of atheromatous plaque>or=1 mm. Aortic plaques were classified as uncomplicated in 20.5% and complicated in 79.5% of patients. Fifty-five plaques (47.8%), both complicated and uncomplicated, remained unchanged. Conversely, 16 plaques (13.9%) increased (mean plaque thickness from 3.94+/-1.39 to 5.56+/-1.41 mm, P<0.001) and 44 (38.3%) decreased (mean plaque thickness from 5.25+/-1.52 to 3.79+/-1.53 mm, P<0.001). Multinomial logistic regression procedure suggests that statins increase the probability of plaque thickness reduction (OR 5.92, 95% CI 1.27-27.7, P=0.024) and decrease the probability of plaque progression (OR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.28, P=0.002).",

High cholesterol level in blood and atherosclerosis play the main role in progression of cardiovascular diseases. Reducing serum cholesterol level has been shown to avoid deleterious effects, whereas in serious diseases it improves the outcome. A widely used, statin-based therapy induces a decrease in de novo cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver. Another possibility for lowering serum cholesterol level is to block the uptake of dietary cholesterol from intestine (e.g. ezetimibe). Coadministration of statins and cholesterol uptake inhibitors provides an efficient therapeutical strategy. Several therapeutic agents, reducing serum cholesterol level, are able to regulate the expression of not only cholesterogenic enzymes, but of the major drug metabolizing enzymes, cytochromes P450. The crosstalk between cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism is mediated by nuclear receptors, activating target genes in response of endogenous and exogenous ligands. Better understanding of the crosstalk between cholesterol homeostasis and drug metabolism is essential for developing an adequate strategy in therapy and in novel drug development.",

    "16": "With the increasing emphasis on vascular disease as a risk factor for dementia and cognitive impairment, lowering cholesterol has received much attention to maintain cognitive function. Observational studies have shown that high total serum cholesterol levels in middle age, but not in old age, associate with cognitive impairment in later life. This can be explained in part since the association between high levels of total serum cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease becomes weaker with increasing age and is absent in old age. Most studies on HDL-cholesterol levels show a protective association with cardiovascular disease up to old age, whereas data on the protective association with late-life cognitive impairment is absent. In contrast to general belief, randomized controlled trials and most longitudinal observational studies do not show a positive effect of statin treatment on the risk of dementia when prescribed in later life. In conclusion, high total serum cholesterol in middle age is associated with cognitive impairment and statin therapy is likely to have a benefit on cognitive function via a decrease of cardiovascular pathologies. However, a beneficial effect of cholesterol lowering on cognitive function in old age is uncertain.",

This period has seen the rapid development and uptake of statin drugs and coronary artery revascularization procedures (CARPs) that include Coronary Artery Bypass Graft procedures (CABGs) and Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCIs). It is difficult in an era of such rapid change to accurately forecast requirements for treatment services such as CARPs. In a previous paper we have described and outlined the use of a Markov Monte Carlo simulation model for analyzing and predicting the requirements for CARPs for the population of Western Australia (Mannan et al, 2007). In this paper, we expand on the use of this model for forecasting CARPs in Western Australia with a focus on the lack of adequate performance of the (standard) model for forecasting CARPs in a period during the mid 1990s when there were considerable changes to CARP technology and implementation policy and an exploration and demonstration of how the standard model may be adapted to achieve better performance.",

In the present study, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone, mps01, was screened from the BAC library constructed from Monascus pilosus BCRC38072 genomic DNA. The putative monacolin K biosynthetic gene cluster was found within a 42 kb region in the mps01 clone. The deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the nine genes designated as mokA- mokI, which share over 54% similarity with the lovastatin biosynthetic gene cluster in A. terreus, were assumed to be involved in monacolin K biosynthesis. A gene disruption construct designed to replace the central part of mokA, a polyketide synthase gene, in wild-type M. pilosus BCRC38072 with a hygromycin B resistance gene through homologous recombination, resulted in a mokA-disrupted strain. The disruptant did not produce monacolin K, indicating that mokA encoded the PKS responsible for monacolin K biosynthesis in M. pilosus BCRC38072.",

Following 2 large acute coronary syndrome trials, additional clinical benefit outside their effect of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering was proposed. This concept was introduced following the observation of cardiovascular event rate reduction, only weeks after initiation of treatment and supposedly before the effect of LDL lowering could have influenced atheroma volume burden. Furthermore, there has been a substantial compilation of experimental data demonstrating beneficial effects of statins on inflammation, thrombosis, platelet aggregation, immunomodulation and endothelial function. These are hypothesized to occur via the interruption of the mevalonate pathway. However, the absolute benefit of these non-lipid-lowering effects, often referred to as 'pleiotropic effects', has been challenged by meta-analysis data. Anti-inflammatory actions have also been proposed to occur by the process of LDL lowering alone rather than due to a unique property of statins. Furthermore, some experimental data reports have shown evidence of pleiotropic effects in non-statin lipid-modifying agents. In this review article, we consolidate what is known so far and critically analyse the literature in order to highlight the outstanding issues.",

As a result of the complexity of treating both HIV- and antiretroviral-related comorbidities, strategies that improve adverse drug events while maintaining viral control are in critical need. Although guidelines have somewhat helped in the general approach and in first-line strategies for managing dyslipidemia in patients receiving antiretrovirals, a paucity of data exist to guide clinicians in treating patients whose conditions are refractory to first-line options or who are at substantial risk for cardiovascular events. Further complicating the choice of lipid-lowering strategy is the lack of randomized controlled data from the HIV-affected population and a concern about clinically significant drug-drug interactions. We describe an HIV-infected patient with efavirenz-associated dyslipidemia at very high cardiovascular risk who had not achieved his primary or secondary lipid goals despite 2 years of treatment in a lipid specialty clinic. Lipid control was accomplished in 10 weeks with a targeted, stepwise approach of switching efavirenz to nevirapine, followed by rosuvastatin 20 mg/day, which was sustained for at least 10 months. Of most importance, this outcome was achieved without any clinically significant alteration in virologic or immunologic control.

This study was designed to estimate the in vitro Cl(biliary) in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes (SCRHs) of angiotensin II receptor blockers and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that undergo limited metabolism, to compare the estimated Cl(biliary) values with published in vivo Cl(biliary) data in rats, and to characterize the mechanism(s) of basolateral uptake and canalicular excretion of these drugs in rats. The average biliary excretion index (BEI) and in vitro Cl(biliary) values of olmesartan, valsartan, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin were 15, 19, 43, 45, and 20%, respectively, and 1.7, 3.2, 4.4, 46.1, and 34.6 ml/min/kg, respectively.

Although Mrp2 plays a minor role in pitavastatin biliary excretion, pitavastatin BEI and Cl(biliary) were reduced in TR(-) compared with WT SCRHs; Bcrp expression in SCRHs from TR(-) rats was decreased.

    "63": "It has been shown that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors have pleiotropic effects and that human serum paraoxonase (PON1) inhibits the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein. We investigated the effects of pitavastatin on PON1 gene promoter activity and PON1 protein expression through the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascades in cultured Huh7 cells. Both PON1 gene promoter activity and PON1 protein expression were elevated by pitavastatin stimulation. Pitavastatin phosphorylated p44/42 MAP kinase. The effects of pitavastatin on PON1 promoter activity and PON1 protein expression were attenuated by PD98059. The cotransfection of Sp1 expression vector increased PON1 promoter activity, and mithramycin suppressed pitavastatin-enhanced PON1 promoter activity. The latter activity was attenuated by cotransfection with the expression vector of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) with mutated p44/42 MAP kinase specific phosphorylation sites. Pitavastatin increased the Sp1-PON1 DNA complex and this effect was attenuated by PD98059. These observations suggest that pitavastatin phosphorylates p44/42 MAP kinase and then activates the transcription of PON1 gene and increases the PON1 protein expression in Huh7 cells. Furthermore, we speculate that pitavastatin affects both the phosphorylation of SREBP-2 and the Sp1 binding to PON1 DNA through the activation of p44/42 MAP kinase signaling cascade.",

Intensive statin therapy reduces the recurrence of cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndromes. The aim of this study was to examine nuclear factor-kappa B activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 levels, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity in plasma from patients with NSTEACS (at 0 days, 4 days, 2 months, and 6 months), patients with stable coronary artery disease, and healthy controls. On day 4, patients with NSTEACS were randomized to receive atorvastatin 80 mg/day (n = 14) or standard treatment (n = 16) during 2 months to study its effect on these parameters. Nuclear factor-kappa B activity (by electrophoretic mobility shift assay), PGE2 levels (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and MMP-9 activity (by gelatin zymography) in the plasma of patients with NSTEACS were significantly increased compared with patients with coronary artery disease and healthy controls. At 6 months, MMP-9 activity was normalized, whereas nuclear factor-kappa B activity and PGE2 levels were still increased. Leukotriene B4 plasma levels (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were similar in patients with NSTEACS and those with coronary artery disease but were significantly higher than those of healthy subjects. There was a significant correlation between plasma PGE2 levels and MMP-9 activity in patients with NSTEACS (r = 0.754, p <0.01). Atorvastatin 80 mg/day reduced circulating PGE2 levels (median 222.4 [interquartile range 157.4 to 253.5] vs 550.8 [276.9 to 613.0] pg/ml, p = 0.006) and MMP-9 activity (0.0025 [0.0017 to 0.0035] vs 0.0280 [0.0057 to 0.0712] arbitrary units, p = 0.03). In conclusion, nuclear factor-kappa B activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and plasma PGE2 levels and MMP-9 activity, increase during NSTEACS. Atorvastatin 80 mg/day normalizes PGE2 levels and MMP-9 activity, providing additional mechanisms by which intensive atorvastatin therapy may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events.",

The pretreatment with 10 microM simvastatin and inhibition of Ras activity by manumycin A significantly reversed high glucose promotion of VEGF mRNA expression. Pretreatment with simvastatin and manumycin A clearly affected the activation of Ras promoted by high glucose. Tube-like formations were abundant in high glucose-treated mesangial cells co-cultured with HUVEC. However, the simvastatin and manumycin A treatment group's down-regulated tube formation was comparable to the mesangial cells treated only with high glucose.

However, paradoxically, simvastatin exacerbated IRI-induced neutrophil infiltration into the lungs. IRI induced collagen IV degradation in the lungs but not in the kidneys. The degree of collagen breakdown in the lungs was significantly ameliorated by 2 mg/kg simvastatin. NOS inhibition markedly protected both the lungs and the kidneys against IRI-induced neutrophil infiltration but did not alter collagen IV degradation.

The final body weight in group IV was significantly higher than that in groups I-III (all values of p < 0.0001). Experimental results demonstrated that Cx43 expression in the aortic wall did not differ among groups II-IV (p > 0.1). However, compared with groups II-IV, Cx43 expression in the aortic wall was significantly mitigated in group I (all values of p < 0.05).

    "86": "There are 3 important factors that predispose patients to plaque rupture or recurrent events: plaque burden or multiple arterial plaques, the presence of persistent hyperreactive platelets, and ongoing vascular arterial inflammation. Successful therapeutic strategies focus on these predisposing factors, and the use of low-density lipoprotein-lowering medications (principally statins) and antiplatelet agents (principally aspirin) has had a major impact on the occurrence of cardiovascular outcomes and overall mortality over the last 2 decades. However, despite these interventions, a significant number of patients experience recurrent events or progression of disease. Novel compounds are being studied to determine, for example, whether an increase in high-density lipoprotein will provide additional risk reduction; to date, this has not proved to be sufficiently effective. Although early invasive management has been proved to be superior to medical therapy in patients with plaque rupture producing acute coronary syndromes, its superiority in patients with clinically stable obstructive disease has been questioned. Thus, the search for additional agents to improve the outcomes of patients with atherothrombotic disease continues. The importance of inflammation, a potentially critical element in the initiation, progression, and rupture of plaque, has become increasingly evident. In this supplement, the role of inflammation and its principal cause, oxidative stress, are analyzed as potential targets of pharmacologic therapy. The history of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapy in cardiovascular disease is critically examined. Finally, the whole process of contemporary drug discovery and development from lead rationale and identification through biologic screening and testing in animals and then humans is explored, using as an example the xanthophyll carotenoids, a class of potent antioxidants currently under investigation.", 
    "87": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is commonly amplified and mutated in glioblastoma, making it a compelling therapeutic target. Recent reports have demonstrated clinical activity of the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib in a subset of glioblastoma patients. Co-expression of EGFRvIII, a constitutively active mutant receptor expressed in 50% of tumours, and PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K activity, by glioblastoma cells is associated with clinical response to these EGFR kinase inhibitors. PTEN loss and resulting increased PI3K pathway activity appears to act as a resistance factor. A critical therapeutic challenge is to identify agents that enhance the anti-cancer effects of these agents and promote responsiveness to EGFR kinase inhibitors in a broader spectrum of glioblastoma patients. For example, combining gefitinib with inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway show enhanced cytotoxicity in glioblastoma derived cell lines. Here, we show that targeting HMG-CoA reductase with lovastatin, that can affect the activity of multiple cell signaling pathways, significantly enhanced the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the five cell lines tested. In an isogenic model system, U87MG glioblastoma cells expressing EGFRvIII and PTEN in relevant combinations, we show that combined gefitinib and lovastatin treatments induce potent synergistic cytotoxicity irrespective of EGFRvIII and PTEN status. These studies demonstrate the potential of lovastatin to augment the cytotoxic effects of gefitinib and provide a rationale for combined statin/EGFR targeted therapies in glioblastoma patients.",

    "89": "Retinal ischemia/reperfusion was induced by transient elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Retinal expression of HSPs was evaluated at different time points after drug and solvent injection and retinal ischemia/reperfusion by means of PCR and Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescent staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to localize the expression of HSPs in normal and ischemic retinas.", 
    "90": "During the acute phase after retinal ischemia, alphaB-crystallin protein and mRNA expression were reduced after statin treatment. After 72 hours of reperfusion, statins increased the expression of alphaB-crystallin and reduced the expression of HSP27 in the retina. Increased expression of alphaB-crystallin early after lesion and statin delivery correlated with increased expression of the heat shock factors 1 and 2. Statins significantly enhanced retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival 10 days after transient retinal ischemia in vivo.", 
    "91": "Systemic delivery of statins after a transient period of retinal ischemia significantly modulated HSP expression in the retina and enhanced RGC survival. Together, these results support the notion that statins constitute a feasible therapeutic approach to prevent some of the neuronal damage in the acute and possibly also the delayed phase and have beneficial effects in central nervous system (CNS) disorders directly affecting the visual system.",

Niacin significantly increased HDL cholesterol and apoA-I concentrations, associated with a significant increase in apoA-I production rate (PR) and no change in fractional catabolic rate (FCR). Plasma TRL apoB-100 levels were significantly lowered by niacin, accompanied by a trend toward an increase in FCR and no change in PR. Niacin treatment significantly increased TRL apoB-48 FCR but had no effect on apoB-48 PR. No effects of niacin on concentrations or kinetic parameters of IDL and LDL apoB-100 and HDL apoA-II were noted. The addition of lovastatin to niacin promoted a lowering in LDL apoB-100 attributable to increased LDL apoB-100 FCR.",

    "96": "The effects of atorvastatin (40 mg/d) and fenofibrate (200 mg/d) on the kinetics of very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-apoC-III were investigated in a crossover trial of 11 MetS men. VLDL-apoC-III kinetics were studied, after intravenous d(3)-leucine administration using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and compartmental modeling. Compared with placebo, both atorvastatin and fenofibrate significantly decreased (P<0.001) plasma concentrations of triglyceride, apoB, apoB-48, and total apoC-III. Atorvastatin, not fenofibrate, significantly decreased plasma apoA-V concentrations (P<0.05). Both agents significantly increased the fractional catabolic rate (+32% and +30%, respectively) and reduced the production rate of VLDL-apoC-III (-20% and -24%, respectively), accounting for a significant reduction in VLDL-apoC-III concentrations (-41% and -39%, respectively). Total plasma apoC-III production rates were not significantly altered by the 2 agents. Neither treatment altered insulin resistance and body weight.",

SPLA(2) activity as primary endpoint, sPLA(2)-IIA protein, oxLDL levels, and high-sensitivity (hs)-C-reactive protein were measured by an enzyme-linked immunabsorbent assay. In both treatment groups, systolic BP levels and circulating HDL and LDL levels were reduced to the same extent. The combined treatment of PRAV+IRB significantly decreased sPLA(2)-IIA activity and sPLA(2)-IIA-protein concentration compared with PRAV treatment alone (P < 0.05). In addition, PRAV+IRB significantly reduced oxLDL levels compared with PRAV treatment alone (P < 0.05). This effect was independent of changes in LDL cholesterol levels.",

    "101": "The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the U.S. continues to increase, and now over 10% of the U.S. population has some form of CKD. Although some patients with CKD will ultimately develop renal failure, most patients with CKD will die of cardiovascular disease before dialysis becomes necessary. Patients with CKD have major proatherogenic lipid abnormalities that are treatable with readily available therapies. The severe derangements seen in lipoprotein metabolism in patients with CKD typically results in high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Because of the prevalence of triglyceride disorders in patients with CKD, after treating patients to a low-density lipoprotein goal, non-HDL should be calculated and used as the secondary goal of treatment. A review of the evidence from subgroup analysis of several landmark lipid-lowering trials supports treating dyslipidemia in mild to moderate CKD patients with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The evidence to support treating dyslipidemia in hemodialysis patients, however, has been mixed, with several outcome trials pending. Patients with CKD frequently have mixed dyslipidemia and often require treatment with multiple lipid-lowering drugs. Although statins are the cornerstone of therapy for most patients with CKD, differences in their pharmacokinetic properties give some statins a safety advantage in patients with advanced CKD. Although most other lipid-lowering agents can be used safely with statins in combination therapy in patients with CKD, the fibrates are renally metabolized and require both adjustments in dose and very careful monitoring due to the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis. After reviewing the safety and dose alterations required in managing dyslipidemia in patients with CKD, a practical treatment algorithm is proposed.",

    "107": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease with a long asymptomatic phase. Disease progression can lead eventually to the occurrence of acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris and sudden cardiac death. While the disease is still in a subclinical stage, however, the presence of atherosclerosis can be identified by several methods, including coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasonography, B-mode ultrasonography, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Based on the results of imaging studies, statin therapy can slow, halt or even reverse the progression of atherosclerotic disease, depending on the intensity of treatment. Whether to screen and treat patients for subclinical atherosclerosis remains controversial. Although atheromatous plaque burden reduction has not yet been definitively correlated with significant decreases in risk for acute coronary events in asymptomatic patients, statin therapy contributes significantly to the risk reduction observed in clinical trials in patients with and without overt coronary disease.", 
    "108": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) dose-dependently lower both the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of cardiovascular disease. In 2004, the UK approved a low-dose over-the-counter (OTC) simvastatin, but the US has rejected applications for non-prescription preparations of statins. The pharmacokinetics and interaction potentials of the possible OTC candidate statins simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin and pravastatin are clearly different. Simvastatin and lovastatin are mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, fluvastatin is metabolized by CYP2C9, and pravastatin is excreted largely unchanged. Several cell membrane transporters can influence the disposition of statins, e.g. the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 enhances their hepatic uptake. The c.521T>C (p.Val174Ala) genetic polymorphism of SLCO1B1 (encoding OATP1B1) considerably increases the plasma concentrations of simvastatin acid and moderately increases those of pravastatin but seems to have no significant effect on fluvastatin. Strong inhibitors of CYP3A (itraconazole, ritonavir) greatly (up to 20-fold) increase plasma concentrations of simvastatin, lovastatin and their active acid forms, thus enhancing the risk of myotoxicity. Weak or moderately potent CYP3A inhibitors such as verapamil, diltiazem and grapefruit juice can be used cautiously with low doses of simvastatin or lovastatin, but their concomitant use needs medical supervision. Potent inducers of CYP3A can greatly decrease plasma concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid, and probably those of lovastatin and lovastatin acid. Although fluvastatin is metabolized by CYP2C9, its concentrations are changed less than 2-fold by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C9. Pravastatin plasma concentrations are not significantly affected by any CYP inhibition and only slightly affected by inducers. Ciclosporin inhibits CYP3A, P-glycoprotein and OATP1B1. Gemfibrozil and its glucuronide inhibit CYP2C8 and OATP1B1. Ciclosporin and gemfibrozil increase plasma concentrations of statins and the risk of their myotoxicity, but fluvastatin seems to carry a smaller risk than other statins. Inhibitors of OATP1B1 may decrease the benefit-risk ratio of simvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin by interfering with their (active acid forms) entry into hepatocytes. Understanding the differences in the pharmacokinetics and interaction potential of various statins helps in their selection for possible non-prescription status. On the pharmacokinetic basis, fluvastatin and pravastatin can be better choices than simvastatin or lovastatin for an OTC statin.", 
    "109": "L-glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Termination of glutamate receptor activation and maintenance of low extracellular glutamate concentrations are mainly achieved by glutamate transporters [excitatory amino acid transporters 1-5 (EAAT1-5)] located in nerve endings and surrounding glial cells. Selective and potent inhibitors have long been required to investigate the physiological significance of transporters in the regulation of synaptic transmission and the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. Non-transportable blockers are desirable because, unlike competitive substrates, they do not cause ion flux and heteroexchange. After a series of possible candidate molecules, we synthesized threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA), the first non-transportable blocker for all subtypes of EAATs. In addition, TBOA analogs with a bulky substituent on their benzene ring showed enhanced inhibition of labeled glutamate uptake. Comparing the effects of substrates and non-transportable blockers revealed the physiological roles of EAATs. We also developed a novel binding assay system using a tritium-labeled TBOA analog. In this review, we describe the design and synthesis of these blockers and the functions of the EAATs elucidated with them.",

Rats were divided into simvastatin group and the control group after cardiac infarction operation. Simvastatin treatment significantly increased the number of peripheral blood CD34+ CD133+ cells, and serum concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and AKT was markedly increased in vivo. In cultured EPC, simvastatin increased the concentrations of VEGF, AKT and eNOS. Western blots analysis showed that simvastatin increased the phosphorylation of eNOS and FKHRL1, which can be blocked by the PI3K/AKT pathway blocker LY294002 . Our study demonstrated that simvastatin increases the mobilization of EPCs after cardiac infarction. In in vitro study, simvastatin increases the phosphorylation of eNOS and of FKHRL1 through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.", 
    "115": "Statins are one of the most well-studied class of drugs and the benefits of statins in the treatment and prevention of both cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease are well documented. Statin monotherapy is safe and well tolerated, with a low frequency of adverse events. However, conditions that raise the plasma concentrations of statins, such as high doses or combination therapy, can increase the potential risk of adverse events. The cataloging of drug interactions within scientific journals and improvements in our understanding of drug metabolism mean that statin-drug interactions are an avoidable problem. However, large numbers of patients are still prescribed interacting medications, and approximately 50% of serious adverse events related to statin therapy are due to drug-drug interactions. Within the statin class of drugs, each agent has a unique pharmacokinetic profile that can make one statin more suitable than another for a particular treatment regimen or patient group. Careful consideration of the lipid lowering efficacy and also the risk profile for drug-drug interactions should be taken before initiating patients on statin therapy, or switching patients between different drugs of the statin class.", 
    "116": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia with significant morbidity and public health cost. Because of limitations of efficacy and safety of conventional antiarrhythmic agents, alternative therapies for AF are needed. The potential antiarrhythmic properties of lipid-altering therapy, including the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and fish oils, are increasingly recognized, particularly in light of their potential anti-inflammatory properties. This review examines the known effects of lipid-altering therapy on atrial arrhythmias in both experimental and clinical settings. Inflammatory states, such as post-cardiac surgery and AF of recent onset, show promise as targets. In contrast, lipid-lowering therapy is less likely to affect longstanding persistent AF. Current recommendations for the use of lipid-altering therapy for prevention and treatment of AF are summarized.", 
    "117": "We and others have demonstrated that fibrates [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha agonists] and statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) exerted neuroprotective and pleiotropic effects in experimental models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Because the combination of statins and fibrates synergistically enhanced PPARalpha activation, we hypothesized that the combination of both drugs may exert more important and/or prolonged beneficial effects in TBI than each alone. In this study, we examined the combination of fenofibrate with simvastatin, administered 1 and 6 h after injury, on the consequences of TBI. First, our dose-effect study demonstrated that the most efficient dose of simvastatin (37.5 mg/kg) reduced post-traumatic neurological deficits and brain edema. Then, the effects of the combination of fenofibrate (50 mg/kg) and simvastatin (37.5 mg/kg), given p.o. at 1 and 6 h after TBI, were evaluated on the TBI consequences in the early and late phase after injury. The combination exerted more sustained neurological recovery-promoting and antiedematous effects than monotherapies, and it synergistically decreased the post-traumatic brain lesion. Furthermore, a delayed treatment given p.o. at 3 and 8 h after TBI with the combination was still efficient on neurological deficits induced by TBI, but it failed to reduce the brain edema at 48 h. The present data represent the first demonstration that the combination of fenofibrate and simvastatin exerts prolonged and synergistic neuroprotective effects than each drug alone. Thus, these results may have important therapeutic significance for the treatment of TBI.", 
    "118": "Since their introduction in the 1980s, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have emerged as the one of the best-selling medication classes to date, with numerous trials demonstrating powerful efficacy in preventing cardiovascular outcomes. As our understanding of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and atherosclerosis continues to grow, the concept of 'lower is better' has corresponded with a more is better' approach to statin-based therapy. This review provides a detailed understanding of the clinical efficacy and safety of statins with a particular emphasis on the third generation drug, rosuvastatin.", 
    "119": "Although widely used in lipid lowering therapy, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (even when administered at high doses) are frequently insufficient to achieve guideline-recommended LDL-C goals for many patients with hypercholesterolemia in everyday clinical practice. Many patients do not achieve LDL-C goal on the initial dose of statin and the majority of these patients does not reach their goal after 6 months. As a consequence, a wide therapeutic gap exists between target LDL-C levels and those typically achieved in clinical practice. A recent and more effective therapeutic hypocholesterolemic strategy is to treat the two main sources of cholesterol simultaneously (production of cholesterol, mainly in the liver, and absorption of cholesterol in the intestine) with a complementary mechanism of action, by co-administering ezetimibe, a novel agent inhibiting cholesterol absorption, with a statin, which inhibits cholesterol production in the liver. Ezetimibe can be effectively and safely co-administered with any dose of any statin and, compared with the single inhibition of cholesterol production, afforded by statins alone, provides consistently greater reductions in LDL-C through dual inhibition of both cholesterol production and absorption. We summarize the pivotal role of both the liver and intestine in the overall balance of cholesterol in the body and describe the clinical impact and relevance of using ezetimibe either alone or co-administered with statins in controlling elevated levels of plasma LDL cholesterol.",

    "124": "Several clinical studies of statin therapy have demonstrated that lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol prevents atherosclerotic progression and decreases cardiovascular mortality. In addition, oxidized LDL (oxLDL) is suggested to play roles in the formation and progression of atherosclerosis. However, whether lowering oxLDL alone, rather than total LDL, affects atherogenesis remains unclear.", 
    "125": "To clarify the atherogenic impact of oxLDL, lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1), an oxLDL receptor, was expressed ectopically in the liver with adenovirus administration in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice at 46 weeks of age. Hepatic LOX-1 expression enhanced hepatic oxLDL uptake, indicating functional expression of LOX-1 in the liver. Although plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol levels were unaffected, plasma oxLDL was markedly and transiently decreased in LOX-1 mice. In controls, atherosclerotic lesions, detected by Oil Red O staining, were markedly increased (by 38%) during the 4-week period after adenoviral administration. In contrast, atherosclerotic progression was almost completely inhibited by hepatic LOX-1 expression. In addition, plasma monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and lipid peroxide levels were decreased, whereas adiponectin was increased, suggesting decreased systemic oxidative stress. Thus, LOX1 expressed in the livers of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice transiently removes oxLDL from circulating blood and possibly decreases systemic oxidative stress, resulting in complete prevention of atherosclerotic progression despite the persistence of severe LDL hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.",

Greater upregulation of HMGCRv_1 in vitro was significantly correlated (P<or=0.0001) with smaller in vivo reductions of plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apoprotein B, and triglycerides and explained 6% to 15% of the variation in their response to treatment. In contrast, no significant relationship was found between expression of the full-length HMGCR transcript and in vivo response. By siRNA knockdown of the full-length transcript, we found that HMGCR enzyme activity measured in cells enriched in HMGCRv_1 was relatively resistant to statin inhibition, consistent with the association of increased alternative splicing with reduced statin response in the CAP study. In addition, we found that a common HMGCR single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs3846662) located within intron 13 was associated with variation in the proportion of HMGCR mRNA that is alternatively spliced.",

Statins: after the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001, the ADR reporting rate increased more than 4-fold, with musculoskeletal ADRs representing about 60% of all the ADRs reported in that year, and progressively decreased in the following years. Nimesulide: an increase in hepatic ADR reporting was observed after withdrawal of the drug from the Finnish and Spanish markets in 2002. Coxibs: no important changes in the rate of cardiovascular events reporting in the period 2000-4 were observed. In 2005, after the withdrawal of rofecoxib in September 2004, both the ADR reporting rate and sales of the drug decreased drastically.",

Target levels of plasma lipids and management of HIV-related dyslipidemia generally follow the same guidelines as in the general population.

However, in patients with or without acute coronary syndrome, long-term prognosis was favorably influenced in patients on statin therapy.

Exposure of RAW264.7 macrophages to statins increased the expression of GRP78, activating transcription factor 6, X box protein-1, and phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha, while it had no effect on CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-homologous protein. GRP78 induction was abolished by co-treatment with mevalonate and 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N',N'-tetraacetic acid, indicating the involvement of both 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Studies on promoter activity measurements indicated that phosphoinositide turnover, cellular homologue of v-src (c-Src), protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38 are involved in upregulating GRP78 gene transcription. We also observed that elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) and interruption of small G proteins are two bifurcated but cooperative signalling pathways for c-Src activation, leading to downstream activation of phospholipase C, PKC, ERK, and p38. Functionally we demonstrated that fluvastatin could protect macrophages from hypoxia-induced cell death through GRP78 induction.",

Recent evidence, however, suggests that longer-term use may reduce risk of more advanced disease. The authors conducted a population-based study of 1,001 incident prostate cancer cases diagnosed in 2002-2005 and 942 age-matched controls from King County, Washington, to evaluate risk associated with statin use. Logistic regression was used to generate odds ratios for ever use, current use, and duration of use.

In addition to effectively lowering cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels, rosuvastatin and certain other statins can also increase plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol modestly. However, the mechanism of action of rosuvastatin on HDL metabolic processes is not understood. Using cultured human hepatoblastoma cells (Hep G2) as an in vitro model system, we assessed the effect of rosuvastatin on apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apo A-II (the major proteins of HDL) synthesis and HDL catabolic processes. Rosuvastatin dose-dependently increased messenger RNA expression and de novo synthesis of apo A-I but not apo A-II. Rosuvastatin selectively increased the synthesis of HDL particles containing only apo A-I (LP A-I) but not particles containing both apo A-I and A-II (LP A-I + A-II). The HDL(3)-protein or HDL(3)-cholesterol ester uptake by Hep G2 cells was not affected by rosuvastatin. The apo A-I-containing particles secreted by rosuvastatin-treated Hep G2 significantly increased cholesterol efflux from fibroblasts. The data indicate that rosuvastatin increases hepatic apo A-I but not apo A-II messenger RNA transcription, thereby selectively increasing the synthesis of functionally active apo A-I-containing HDL particles, which mediate cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues. We suggest that this mechanism of action of rosuvastatin to increase apo A-I production without apo A-I/HDL removal may result in increased apo A-I turnover that results in accelerated reverse cholesterol transport.",

WM is a B-cell disorder characterized primarily by bone marrow infiltration with lymphoplasmacytic cells, along with demonstration of an IgM monoclonal gammopathy. Despite advances in therapy, WM remains incurable, with 5-6 years median overall survival of patients in symptomatic WM. Therapy is postponed for asymptomatic patients, and progressive anemia is the most common indication for initiation of treatment. The main therapeutic options include alkylating agents, nucleoside analogues, and rituximab. Studies involving combination chemotherapy are ongoing, and preliminary results are encouraging. No specific agent or regimen has been shown to be superior to another for treatment of WM. As such, novel therapeutic agents are needed for the treatment of WM. In ongoing efforts, we and others have sought to exploit advances made in the understanding of the biology of WM so as to better target therapeutics for this malignancy. These efforts have led to the development of several novel agents including the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, and several Akt/mTor inhibitors, perifosine and Rad001, and immunomodulatory agents such as thalidomide and lenalidomide. Studies with monoclonal antibodies are ongoing and promising including the use of alemtuzumab, SGN-70, and the APRIL/BLYS blocking protein TACI-Ig atacicept.

    "163": "AS, AVS and AVC share many common risk factors with atherosclerosis and are possible markers of preclinical vascular disease. Statins appear to delay the progression of AS. However, more studies are needed before introducing such pharmacologic treatment for AS. The future may point towards targeted prevention of AS.",

Data were retrieved on patients' sex, year of birth and immigration, socioeconomic status, and whether they had diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "167": "Mean age at the beginning of treatment was 61.3 +/- 11.8 years; 53.3% of the study patients were women. The proportion with at least 1 chronic disease before starting statins was 40.1%; and 38.9%, 21.8%, and 9.6% of the patients were continuously adherent after 1, 3, and 6 years, respectively. Risk of discontinuation was highest among new immigrants (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14, 1.27). Adherence was higher in patients having a chronic disease before starting statins (HR = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.84, 0.94) or after starting statins (HR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.86, 0.95). Patients age <50 or >79 years had lower adherence rates. Low socioeconomic state did not affect adherence.", 
    "168": "Adherence with statin therapy was poor, though adherence rates were better in patients with accompanying chronic diseases. Of particular concern was the low level of adherence in new immigrants. Intervention programs are needed and should target all patient groups.",

The index date was the first date of discharge for members with an MI diagnosis. Members were categorized into the active group (automatically enrolled in the DM program) or the control group (not enrolled in the program because their employer group did not purchase the benefit). Pharmacy claims were obtained for 12 months after the index date for ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, and statins.",

There were no statistical differences in utilization or time to first prescription fill of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta-blockers, and statins between the DM and usual care groups. Adherence to each of these therapies, as measured by medication possession ratio, was not statistically different between the 2 groups.",

In hypercholesterolemia, HDL-C is raised by approximately 4% to 10%. The percentage changes are greater in patients with low baseline levels, including those with the common combination of high triglycerides (TG) and low HDL-C. These effects do not appear to be dose-related although there is evidence that, with the exception of atorvastatin, the changes in HDL-C are proportional to reductions in apo B-containing lipoproteins. The most likely explanation is a reduced rate of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated flow of cholesterol from HDL. There is some evidence that the statin effects on HDL reduce progression of atherosclerosis and risk of cardiovascular disease independently of reductions in LDL.", 
    "177": "Statins cause modest increases in HDL-C and apo A-I probably mediated by reductions in CETP activity. It is plausible that such changes independently contribute to the cardiovascular benefits of the statin class but more studies are needed to further explore this possibility.", 
    "178": "The effect of steady-state istradefylline, an agent for Parkinson's disease with P-glycoprotein and CYP3A inhibitory activity, on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and its metabolites was evaluated in healthy volunteers. A single 40-mg dose of atorvastatin was administered to 20 subjects. After a 4-day washout, subjects received a single 40-mg atorvastatin dose following 40 mg istradefylline (n=16) or placebo (n=4) daily for 14 days. Plasma samples collected for 96 hours after atorvastatin administration, alone and in combination, were analyzed for atorvastatin, orthohydroxy atorvastatin, and parahydroxy atorvastatin. Istradefylline increased atorvastatin C(max) (53%), AUC(0-infinity) (54%), and t((1/2)) (27%); and increased AUC(0-infinity) for orthohydroxy atorvastatin (18%), but had no significant effect on its C(max) or t((1/2)); and had minimal effect on parahydroxy atorvastatin AUC(0-infinity). The lack of inhibition by istradefylline on metabolite systemic exposure, combined with increased atorvastatin systemic exposure, suggests a predominant P-glycoprotein inhibitory effect of istradefylline.", 
    "179": "The indication for HMG-CoA-reductase-inhibitors (CSE inhibitors, \"statins\") for primary prevention of atherosclerosis requires a careful risk/benefit calculation. For this, the PROCAM and SCORE risk scores offer validated, hands on decision support tools.

We selected patients hospitalized for MI as cases if they used antihypertensive drugs and had a diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia before their first MI. Controls met the same eligibility criteria, but were not hospitalized for MI. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and synergy index with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), and to adjust for potential confounding factors.", 
    "186": "We included 459 cases and 1805 controls. The risk of MI was significantly lower among participants exposed to statins compared with participants not exposed to statins (adjusted OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.29-0.47). The GNB3T allele was associated with a reduced risk of MI (adjusted OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60-0.92). Among homozygous wild-type (CC) individuals (n=1119), exposure to statins was associated with a lower risk of MI (OR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.34-0.67). However, T allele carriers (CT and TT) who used statins had an even stronger reduced risk of MI (OR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.19-0.39). Overall, the interaction between exposure to statins and the GNB3 C825T polymorphism was significantly increased on the multiplicative scale (synergy index: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.06-2.65).",

    "192": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of rosuvastatin twice weekly in 40 patients intolerant to daily statins. Rosuvastatin twice weekly alone or added to other lipid-lowering medications decreased total cholesterol by 19%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 26%, and triglycerides by 14% (p<0.01 for all). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change. Eight of the 40 patients (20%) discontinued twice-weekly rosuvastatin treatment because of muscle-related symptoms, during an average of 8 weeks of treatment. In conclusion, rosuvastatin twice weekly reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides and was well tolerated, but determining long-term tolerability requires more prolonged treatment.", 
    "193": "Results of well-controlled prospective clinical trials showed the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapies in the reduction of cardiovascular (CV) events in western populations, but they were not reported with a Chinese population. This multicenter study was conducted to determine the effects of Xuezhikang (XZK), a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, on lipoprotein and CV end points in Chinese patients who experienced a previous myocardial infarction. Nearly 5,000 of these patients with average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at baseline were randomly assigned either to placebo or to XZK daily for an average of 4.5 years. The primary end point was a major coronary event that included nonfatal myocardial infarction and death from coronary heart disease. Frequencies of the primary end point were 10.4% in the placebo group and 5.7% in the XZK-treated group, with absolute and relative decreases of 4.7% and 45%, respectively. Treatment with XZK also significantly decreased CV and total mortality by 30% and 33%, the need for coronary revascularization by 1/3, and lowered total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, but raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In conclusion, long-term therapy with XZK significantly decreased the recurrence of coronary events and the occurrence of new CV events and deaths, improved lipoprotein regulation, and was safe and well tolerated.", 
    "194": "The length of hospital stay shortens increasingly. Even more patients are assessed and clarified in the outpatient clinic. Preoperative evaluation is performed ambulatory or by the general practitioner himself. There is still a trend towards fewer and more selective examinations. The value of evaluation algorithms is subject of debate nowadays. Moreover, these extensive and abstract procedures are not always helpful in clinical practice. The perioperative cardioprotection with beta-blockers and statins and the continuation of antiplatelet therapy seems to have significance in reduction of perioperative cardiac events. However, a careful physical examination and a precise medical history of the patient have not become less important today. They contribute significantly to an efficient preoperative evaluation.", 
    "195": "Of currently approved drugs, niacin is the most effective in raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System provides 1 mechanism to evaluate the safety of niacin as it is used in common clinical practice. In this report, the authors review recent analyses of adverse events reported to the FDA demonstrating that the extended-release formulation of niacin (niacin-ER) has a significantly better safety profile compared with other niacin formulations and compares favorably with other commonly used lipid-altering drugs, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and fibrates. In addition, analyses of FDA adverse event reports of the pill combining lovastatin and niacin-ER suggest that the safety of combination therapy with niacin-ER and a statin is comparable with the safety of each of the drugs alone. These analyses should encourage the use of niacin-ER in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease, as recommended by current national guidelines for cardiovascular prevention."
