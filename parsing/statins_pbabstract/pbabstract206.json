    "0": "The metabolic syndrome is a multiplex risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The core components of the dyslipidemia of the metabolic syndrome, which most likely initiate atherosclerosis, are the \"lipid triad\" of high plasma triglycerides, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and a preponderance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Postprandial lipemia is also recognized as an important component. Dysregulation of fat metabolism in the liver with overproduction of very-low-density lipoprotein 1 (VLDL1) particles is considered the hallmark of the dyslipidemia of the metabolic syndrome. The cornerstone of therapy is therapeutic lifestyle change. If this does not correct the dyslipidemia, drug therapy may be required. LDL-C lowering with statins is the first-line treatment; however, there is ongoing debate as to whether further aggressive LDL-lowering therapy with higher-dose statins as opposed to comprehensive lipid management is the optimal therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. Combination of a statin with a fibrate and/or nicotinic acid can improve all components of the dyslipidemia. However, there are, as yet, no large cardiovascular outcome studies that show a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality using combination therapy. The current LDL-C goal in high-risk patients with the metabolic syndrome is below 100 mg/dL, with a non-HDL goal of below 130 mg/dL. However, in very high-risk patients, such as those with established cardiovascular disease, an LDL-C goal of below 70 mg/dL is recommended.", 
    "1": "The family of organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) plays an important role in mediating the cellular uptake of numerous endogenous and exogenous compounds. Members of this family include human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which have been widely studied and shown to be involved in the hepatic uptake of hormones, bile acids, and many clinically used drugs. However, little is known about the murine orthologue, Oatp1b2. We determined expression of mouse oatp1b2 mRNA and protein using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Interestingly, mRNA transcripts and protein were detectable in a number of tissues including kidney and stomach, and, not surprisingly, the highest expression was noted in liver. Cloning of the full coding region of oatp1b2 revealed the presence of two novel splice variants. Interestingly, these splice variants were significantly expressed in organs such as the kidney, but much less in liver. Heterologous expression of the full-length Oatp1b2 cDNA revealed that taurocholic acid, estrone 3-sulfate, estradiol 17beta-glucuronide and pravastatin are substrates of this transporter. The newly identified splice variants were unable to significantly transport substrate compounds due to defects in cell surface trafficking. Our findings of murine Oatp1b2 expression and function will likely aid in better defining species related differences in OATP transporter function and the use of mouse models to predict hepatic drug disposition in humans.", 
    "2": "Hypercholesterolemia is a common problem among transplant recipients. Despite package-insert warnings about the potential side effects of the use of statins in patients with chronic liver disease, they are often prescribed for liver transplant recipients. Unlike statins, ezetimibe acts through inhibition of enterohepatic recirculation of lipids. We report the effectiveness and safety of ezetimibe among liver transplant recipients because this has been evaluated previously only in kidney and heart transplant patients. A consecutive cohort of 25 liver graft recipients with serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels > 100 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) after a mean (+/-standard deviation) of 55 +/- 21 months following liver transplantation received ezetimibe (10 mg orally every day) for at least 6 months. Serum lipid profiles, liver and renal function tests, and dosages and blood levels of the immunosuppression drugs at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months were prospectively collected. The overall mean age was 58 +/- 12 years, and 56% were males. Statin therapy and fibrates were already being used in 32% and 20% of recipients for elevated LDL and/or triglycerides, respectively. The immunosuppression regimen included cyclosporine in 48% of subjects, tacrolimus in 32%, sirolimus in 48%, and mycophenolate mofetil in 44%; only 12% were on oral prednisone with a maximum daily dose of 5 mg. After ezetimibe was started, an 18% reduction in LDL values was observed [at baseline, 147 +/- 35 mg/dL (3.8 +/- 0.9 mmol/L), and at 6 months, 120 +/- 31 mg/dL (3.1 +/- 0.8 mmol/L); P = 0.010]. After 6 months, an additional 32% achieved the target LDL level of <100 mg/dL. None of the remaining variables, including immunosuppression drug levels, varied significantly during ezetimibe therapy. None of the subjects required adjustments in their pharmacological dosages. One discontinued ezetimibe 3 months later because of cost, 2 subjects had minimal nausea, 1 subject had myalgias without a rise in creatine phosphokinase, and 1 subject had a transient elevation (3-5 times) in liver enzymes from baseline with increases in the total and indirect bilirubin levels. In conclusion, among liver transplant recipients, hypercholesterolemia can be effectively treated with ezetimibe with few side effects and no interaction with immunosuppressive regimens.", 
    "3": "Lipid-lowering agents, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), are widely used to prevent coronary artery disease and often coadministered with other drugs, but there is a possibility that they induce pharmacological interactions with concomitant drugs. The authors aimed to investigate whether statins have any influence on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme activity. Eleven healthy volunteers were enrolled and evaluated for the effects of statins on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in an open-label, randomized, 3-way crossover trial with simvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, and pitavastatin 2 mg. The statins had no effects on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its metabolite, 1'-hydroxymidazolam. Furthermore, the area under the concentration-time curve ratios for 1'-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam from 0 to 10 hours showed no significant differences among 3 statins (simvastatin: 0.32 +/- 0.09, atorvastatin: 0.31 +/- 0.09, and pitavastatin: 0.31 +/- 0.12). These data suggest that statins, at least at low doses used in the present study, do not affect CYP3A4 and can be used safely without influencing CAP3A4 enzyme activity.", 
    "4": "Inasmuch as statins appear to exhibit altered efficacy in some Asian populations (predominantly East Asian), current lipid guidelines recommend the use of lower statin doses in all Asians. Whether this should also apply to South Asians, a population at high risk for coronary heart disease, remains unclear. The authors evaluated the lipid-modifying effects of statins in South Asian and white patients with established coronary heart disease. Atorvastatin (median dose=20 mg/d in both groups) produced similar decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in South Asian (43%) and white (41%) patients and raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) by 19% in South Asians and by 12% in whites. Simvastatin (median dose=20 mg/d in both groups) reduced LDL-c by 35% in South Asians and by 37% in whites while raising HDL-c by 12% in both groups. Using a multiple linear regression model (atorvastatin equivalent), the expected decrease in LDL-c for 10 mg atorvastatin and 20 mg atorvastatin was similar between the groups. Results indicate that atorvastatin and simvastatin, at commonly prescribed doses, modulate LDL-c and HDL-c levels to a similar degree in both South Asians and whites with documented coronary heart disease. These findings suggest that South Asian patients may be treated with atorvastatin and simvastatin at doses typically applied to white patients.",

Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels, as well as to estimate the half-life of ABCB1 mRNA. Western blotting analysis was performed in order to measure protein levels of ABCB1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to evaluate interactions between protein(s) and ABCB1 promoter region. Exposure to atorvastatin for 24h resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of ABCB1 mRNA and protein levels, which was not abolished by addition of farnesyl or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. After removing fetal bovine serum from the media, however, ABCB1 expression was decreased by 2-fold in either HepG2 cells treated and non-treated with atorvastatin. Addition of cholesterol to serum free media abolished this latter effect on ABCB1 mRNA levels. In EMSA using a 5'-end-labeled 241bp ABCB1 promoter DNA fragment (-198 to +43) as probe, the binding of the proteins to the probe was reduced by NF-Y, but not changed by NFkappaB, AP-1, and SP1. However, the NF-Y binding activity was similar in control and atorvastatin-treated cells. mRNA stability studies revealed that ABCB1 mRNA degradation was increased in 1, 10 and 20muM atorvastatin-treated versus control cells (half-lives of 2h versus 7h). Therefore, evidence is provided that decreased mRNA stability by atorvastatin treatment may explain the decrease in ABCB1 transcript levels.",

Number of children with significant vessels pathology (Z-score > 2.0) was small. Increased cIMT was seen at baseline in 4 patients and in 5 after simvastatin treatment, however average and Z-score values in children under simvastatin treatment have decreased. Increased fIMT values were seen at baseline in 2 and in one case after simvastatin treatment. Tolerance of simvastation was very good in all cases but one.",

    "70": "3-Hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) is the key and rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Although HMG-CoAR activity has already been related to the differentiation of some cellular lines there are no studies that analyze the role of HMG-CoAR, and the pathway it is involved with in a fully characterized muscle differentiation model. Thus, the aim of this work is to evaluate such role and delineate the pathway involved in foetal rat myoblasts (L6) induced to differentiate by insulin -- a standard and feasible model of the myogenic process. The results obtained by biochemical and morphological approaches demonstrate that (i) HMG-CoAR increase is crucial for differentiation induction, (ii) p21waf, whose increase is a necessary requisite for differentiation to occur, rises downstream HMG-CoAR activation, (iii) the main role of p38/MAPK as key regulator also for HMG-CoAR. Pathologies characterized by muscle degeneration might benefit from therapeutic programmes committed to muscle function restoration, such as modulation and planning myoblast differentiation. Thus, the important role of HMG-CoAR in muscular differentiation providing new molecular basis for the control of muscle development can help in the design of therapeutic treatment for diseases characterized by the weakening of muscular fibers and aging-related disorders (sarcopenia).", 
    "71": "Aspergiolide A is a novel anti-tumor anthraquinone derivant produced by marine-derived fungus Aspergillus glaucus. To identify its biosynthetic pathway and further improve the production, the effects of biosynthetic pathway specific inhibitors and precursors were investigated. Cerulenin and iodoacetamide, the specific inhibitors of polyketide pathway, could completely inhibit the aspergiolide A accumulation. Putative precursors of polyketide pathway could increase aspergiolide A production greatly, such as 6 mM acetate increased production by 135%. Simvastatin and citrate, the inhibitors of mevalonate pathway, stimulated the production by 63% and 179%, respectively. Considering that acetyl-CoA is the common starter unit in both polyketide and mevalonate pathway, a novel strategy was designed to stimulate the aspergiolide A accumulation. Combinations of 12 mM acetate with 0.3 mM simvastatin could increase the production by 151%, while the supplementation with 12 mM acetate and 12 mM citrate brought a 262% increase of aspergiolide A production. The strategy might be very useful to enhance the production of other secondary metabolites derived from polyketide pathway.",

Radiofrequency catheter ablation of VT has been beneficial in treating selected patients with arrhythmogenic foci of monomorphic VT. The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) is the most effective treatment for patients with life-threatening VT or ventricular fibrillation. Patients with AICDs should be treated with biventricular pacing, not with dual-chamber rate-responsive pacing at a rate of 70/min.

In primary sorted CD34(+) AML cells, a heterogeneous response pattern was observed upon treatment with simvastatin when analyzing cell survival. A group of normal (n = 12) and abnormal (n = 10) responders were identified within the AML CD34(+) subfraction when compared with normal CD34(+) cells. This distinction was not observed within the AML CD34(-) cell fraction. When the CD34(+) AML cells were exposed to simvastatin and tipifarnib, a significant enhanced inhibitory effect was shown exclusively in the normal AML responder group, whereas the AML CD34(-) cell fractions all showed an enhanced inhibitory effect. The observed heterogeneity in AML responsiveness could not be explained by differences in effects on cholesterol metabolism genes or extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in response to simvastatin and tipifarnib treatment.",

Seven interviews were conducted with general practitioners (GPs) in The Netherlands, and analysed using an analytic inductive approach.", 
    "84": "Reasons for not-prescribing could be divided into patient and physician-attributed factors. According to the GPs, some patients do not follow-up on agreed medication and others object to taking lipid-lowering medication, partly for legitimate reasons such as expected or perceived side effects. Furthermore, the GPs themselves perceived reservations for prescribing lipid-lowering medication in patients with short life expectancy, expected compliance problems or near goal lipid levels. GPs sometimes postponed the start of treatment because of other priorities. Finally, barriers were seen in the GPs' practice organisation, and at the primary-secondary care interface.", 
    "85": "Some of the barriers mentioned by GPs seem to be valid reasons, showing that guideline non-adherence can be quite rational. On the other hand, treatment quality could improve by addressing issues, such as lack of knowledge or motivation of both the patient and the GP. More structured management in general practice may also lead to better treatment.",

The fish liver samples were extracted and cleaned up by using liquid-liquid extraction and solid-phase extraction before the extracts were analyzed by LC/MS or LC/MS/MS with electrospray negative and positive ionization. Recoveries of the 5 target compounds from spiked catfish liver ranged from 72 +/- 2 to 100 +/- 3%. Limits of quantification for the 5 compounds were between 4.2 and 12.3 ng/g (wet weight). Ten turbot (Pleuronichthys verticalis) liver samples were analyzed; levels of 17alpha-ethynylestradiol, carbamazepine, simvastatin, and oxybenzone were below the detection limits.

The retention time was 5.70 min. Both the methods were performed at 238 nm, the wavelength of maximum absorbance of PIT in methanol. In the LC method, quantification was achieved with a photodiode array detector over the concentration range of 0.1-2.5 microg/mL with a mean recovery of 100.26 +/- 0.75%. In the UV method, quantification was achieved over the concentration range of 2-20 microg/mL with mean recovery of 99.65 +/- 1.24%. Both methods were validated, and the results were compared statistically. They were found to be simple, specific, accurate, and precise.

This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, four-period crossover study to evaluate the effects of coadministering 10 mg ezetimibe with 20 mg simvastatin (ezetimibe/simvastatin) on cholesterol absorption and synthesis relative to either drug alone or placebo in 41 subjects. Each treatment period lasted 7 weeks. Ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin decreased fractional cholesterol absorption by 65% and 59%, respectively (P < 0.001 for both relative to placebo). Simvastatin did not significantly affect cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe and ezetimibe/simvastatin increased fecal sterol excretion (corrected for dietary cholesterol), which also represents net steady state cholesterol synthesis, by 109% and 79%, respectively (P < 0.001). Ezetimibe, simvastatin, and ezetimibe/simvastatin decreased plasma LDL-cholesterol by 20, 38, and 55%, respectively. The coadministered therapy was well tolerated. The decreases in net cholesterol synthesis and increased fecal sterol excretion yielded nearly additive reductions in LDL-cholesterol for the coadministration of ezetimibe and simvastatin.", 
    "89": "We investigated the effect of atorvastatin on cyclooxygenase (COX) contribution to endothelial dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) mesenteric resistance arteries. Atorvastatin (10 mg/kg per day, oral gavage) or its vehicle was administered for 2 weeks to male SHR or Wistar-Kyoto rats. Endothelial function of mesenteric arteries was assessed by pressurized myograph. In Wistar-Kyoto rats, relaxation to acetylcholine was inhibited by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and unaffected by SC-560 (COX-1 inhibitor), DuP-697 (COX-2 inhibitor), or ascorbic acid. In SHRs, the response to acetylcholine was attenuated, less sensitive to N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, unaffected by SC-560, and enhanced by DuP-697 or SQ-29548 (thromboxane-prostanoid receptor antagonist) to a similar extent. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was normalized by ascorbic acid or apocynin (NADPH oxidase inhibitor), which also restored the inhibition by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. In atorvastatin-treated SHRs, relaxation to acetylcholine was normalized, fully sensitive to N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, and not affected by SC-560, DuP-697, SQ 29548, or antioxidants. Dihydroethidium assay showed an increased intravascular superoxide generation in SHRs, which was abrogated by atorvastatin. RT-PCR revealed a COX-2 induction in SHR arteries, which was downregulated by atorvastatin. The release of prostacyclin and 8-isoprostane was higher from SHR than Wistar-Kyoto mesenteric vessels. COX-2 inhibition and apocynin decreased 8-isoprostane without affecting prostacyclin levels. Atorvastatin increased phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, pAkt, peNOS(1177), and inducible NO synthase levels in SHR mesenteric vessels and decreased 8-isoprostane release. In conclusion, COX-2-derived 8-isoprostane contributes to endothelial dysfunction in SHR mesenteric arteries. Atorvastatin restores NO availability by increasing phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, pAkt, peNOS(1177), and inducible NO synthase levels and by abrogating vascular NADPH oxidase-driven superoxide production, which also results in a downregulation of COX-2-dependent 8-isoprostane generation.", 
    "90": "Recent studies have suggested that statins, the inhibitors for 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. However, the immune modulatory effects of statins on the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells and their underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. To address these issues, we examined the effect of simvastatin and inhibitors for protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation on the differentiation of IL-17-producing T cells (T(h)17 cells) and Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T cells. Simvastatin inhibited the differentiation of T(h)17 cells through the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity but enhanced the differentiation of Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T cells. Geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor, GGTI-298, but not farnesyltransferase inhibitor, FTI-277, mimicked the effects of simvastatin, indicating that the inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation is responsible for the effects. Moreover, Foxp3(+) CD4(+) T cells developed in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta and GGTI-298 functioned as regulatory T cells (Tregs) in in vitro T cell proliferation assay as well as in an autoimmune colitis model. Finally, GGTI-298 induced SOCS3 expression and inhibited IL-6-induced signal transducers and activators of transcription3 phosphorylation in CD4(+) T cells. Taken together, these results indicate that protein geranylgeranylation enhances the differentiation of T(h)17 cells and inhibits the differentiation of Foxp3(+) Tregs partly via the inhibition of SOCS3 expression.",

Data were collected on patient characteristics and treatment, using new Cardiology Audit and Registration Data standards. In total, 3603 patients (24.9%) were diabetic. Diabetics were older, more often female and had a higher body mass index than non-diabetics. Diabetics had higher rates of hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension, while current smokers were more frequent in the non-diabetics. Diabetics also had significantly higher rates of previous cardiovascular events. Clopidogrel was administered only in 48.1% of diabetic patients before PCI, while IIb/IIIa inhibitors were 22.9% during PCI. At discharge, there was a major adjustment of treatment with increases in the use of Beta-blocker (80.4%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, 71.3%) and statins (89.8%) compared with on admission (Beta-blocker 60.9%, ACEI 55.0%, statin 63.1%).

    "94": "India is likely to have the highest absolute burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) related morbidity and mortality in the world. The prevalence of risk-factors (RFs) is high, particularly in the young, and a strategy to reduce RF prevalence in a large population needs to be developed. It is possible to modify risk factors at the individual level or at the population level. The latter is likely to have a greater impact. Current evidence shows that the reduction of risk factors such as BP or serum cholesterol from any level (rather than above a particular threshold) confers potential benefits. At present, lifestyle interventions have not demonstrated the benefits in reducing CVD related mortality and morbidity. A polypharmacotherapy strategy (2-3 BP lowering drugs, a statin, and aspirin) has promise to considerably reduce CVD-related mortality and morbidity. Such a therapy could target a large proportion of the population, intervene simultaneously on multiple RFs, and have wide acceptability. Cost and adherence are important issues for the success of this strategy. Adherence is suboptimal even for secondary prevention. A fixed-dose combination (FDC) of these drugs may improve adherence and reduce costs. But prior to recommending the wide-spread use of an FDC polypharmacotherapy strategy, studies are required to systematically evaluate its efficacy and safety and then determine the adherence, cost, and acceptability in the population. Studies are ongoing in India and other countries to determine the role of FDC polypharmacotherapy in the primary prevention of CVD. Such FDC therapy may reduce costs, improve adherence, and reduce CVD events at the population level; especially in developing countries such as India.", 
    "95": "The introduction of statins led to much interest in their health economic aspects as they were initially perceived as efficacious but potentially expensive. Consequently, abundant literature exists examining the cost effectiveness of various statins, with analyses estimating the costs of preventing a single cardiovascular event using trial-based data, as well as long-term modelling studies using standardized outcomes such as cost per life-years gained or cost per quality-adjusted life-years. Economic evaluations based on clinical trials with hard endpoints indicate that the improved care associated with statin therapy came at a reasonable price in most risk groups. Variations between study results can largely be explained by differences in drug prices and absolute risk in the studied populations. This holds true for both within-trial analyses and modelling studies. The introduction of generic statins has led to sharp price reductions. Consequently, statin use today would be associated with greater cost savings in the indications that were first studied in clinical trials. New therapies entering the field must now compare favourably with statin therapy, whereas earlier a comparison versus placebo would have been sufficient to demonstrate cost effectiveness.",

    "100": "Plasma lipids should - and can reliably - be measured within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. They should again be measured from 1 to 3 months after the event. The level of low-density lipoproteins(LDL) cholesterol remains the marker for treatment initiation and for evaluation of therapeutic goals. The total number of atherogenic particles is a better determinant of cardiovascular risk than the LDL-cholesterol level, as are the levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. The use of apolipoprotein B by primary care physicians is limited by the lack of standardization and must be restricted to specific clinical cases. Non-HDL-cholesterol can be recommended as a secondary target in patients with high triglyceride levels. In coronary patients treated with a statin, management of abnormal levels of triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol is important to minimize the risk of recurrence.",

He was immunosuppressed with tacrolimus (FK) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Postoperative complications were arterial hypertension and renal insufficiency. In June 2007, liver dysfunction was detected and acute rejection was diagnosed by biopsy. He received three 500-mg boluses of methylprednisolone and FK levels were maintained between 10 and 12 ng/mL. Laboratory values revealed persistent rejection and MMF was stopped with initiation of rapamicin. One month later, hyperlipidemia appeared as a consequence of rapamicin therapy; simvastatin was administered. In August 2007, the patient was readmitted due to severe muscule pain and the inability to ambulate. Laboratory values were: total bilirubin 16 mg/dL, serum creatinine 4.3 mg/dL, and total creatine kinase (CK) 42,124 U/L. With the suspicion of rhabdomyolysis, leading to worsening of his basal renal insufficiency, rapamycin and tacrolimus were stopped. Hemodialysis was initiated owing to renal failure and hyperkalemia.

To reduce the overall cardiovascular risk in these patients, lipid-lowering drugs, especially 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, have been widely used. CNI and m-TOR inhibitors, as well as most statins, are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4; thus, pharmacokinetic interactions between these drugs are possible.

    "105": "Oxidative damage to vascular cell membrane phospholipids causes physicochemical changes in membrane structure and lipid organization, contributing to atherogenesis. Oxidative stress combined with hyperglycemia has been shown to further increase the risk of vascular and metabolic diseases. In this study, the effects of glucose on oxidative stress-induced cholesterol domain formation were tested in model membranes containing polyunsaturated fatty acids and physiologic levels of cholesterol. Membrane structural changes, including cholesterol domain formation, were characterized by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis and correlated with spectrophotometrically-determined lipid hydroperoxide levels. Glucose treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in lipid hydroperoxide formation, which correlated with the formation of highly-ordered cholesterol crystalline domains (unit cell periodicity of 34 A) as well as a decrease in overall membrane bilayer width. The effect of glucose on lipid peroxidation was further enhanced by increased levels of cholesterol. Treatment with free radical-scavenging agents inhibited the biochemical and structural effects of glucose, even at elevated cholesterol levels. These data demonstrate that glucose promotes changes in membrane organization, including cholesterol crystal formation, through lipid peroxidation.", 
    "106": "Despite the inconsistent or weak association between cholesterol and stroke, lowering of cholesterol concentrations with statins reduces the risk of stroke in high-risk populations and in patients with non-cardioembolic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Statin therapy is the most important advance in stroke prevention since the introduction of aspirin and antihypertensive treatments. Meta-analysis of randomised trials of statins in combination with other preventive strategies, including 165 792 individuals, shows that each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) decrease in LDL cholesterol equates to a reduction in relative risk for stroke of 21.1% (95% CI 6.3-33.5, p=0.009). In secondary prevention of non-cardioembolic stroke, intense reduction of LDL cholesterol by statins also significantly reduced the risk of recurrent stroke (relative risk 0.84, 0.71-0.99, p=0.03) and major cardiovascular events (0.80, 0.69-0.92, p=0.002). Future directions include assessment of a target LDL cholesterol concentration of less than 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), the effects of triglyceride-lowering therapy alone or in combination with statins, and the effects of treatments to raise HDL cholesterol concentrations.",

In this 2-phase crossover study, atorvastatin (40 mg single-oral dose) pharmacokinetics after co-administration of placebo and rifampicin (600 mg single-oral dose) were measured for up to 48 h by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In the third phase, rifampicin (450 mg single-oral dose) pharmacokinetics was measured additionally.",

The present study was designed to examine the effect of pitavastatin on pathways associated with the proinflammatory gene, early growth response (Egr)-1, in human vascular smooth muscle cells. Pretreatment with pitavastatin resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in Egr-1 protein and suppressed Egr-1 mRNA expression in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). A reduction in Egr-1 expression reduced the activation of NGFI-A binding protein (NAB)-2, an Egr-1-dependent gene. Furthermore, these events appeared to be dependent on the ability of pitavastatin to attenuate signaling cascades associated with extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, but not p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).",

Active mimetic peptides have an amphipathic alpha-helical secondary structure, whose hydrophobic face is particularly important for its bioactivity. The most frequently employed peptide is 4F. The comparative bioactivity of variants of 4F, particularly tandem helical peptides, has been explored. The recent observation of the very high affinity of bioactive peptides for oxidized fatty acids and phospholipids provides a likely mechanism for the action of these peptides in inhibiting early atherosclerosis formation. It is not clear that these peptides alone are effective in reversing established atherosclerosis, although they may achieve this outcome in synergy with statin therapy.",

Initially, attention has focused on the cytochrome P450 system as being the source of the observed drug-drug interactions, but nowadays it is clear that other pathways, such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and the organic anion polypeptide B transporter, may also be involved.

Statins combining high potency and little clinically meaningful interactions with antiretroviral therapy (pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) should be preferred as initial therapy, though comparative studies in HIV-infected persons are scarce. A combination of a statin at medium doses with either ezetimibe or a fibrate other than gemfibrozil may result in more satisfactory results than higher doses of statin monotherapy when LDL cholesterol goals are difficult to achieve or there persist elevated triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, respectively.",

The in vitro metabolic profiles of [(14)C]motesanib were examined by using microsomes and hepatocytes from preclinical species and humans. Several oxidative metabolites were observed and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and coinjection with authentic standards. Cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4 is the major isozyme involved in the oxidative biotransformation of motesanib, but the CYP2D6 and CYP1A isozymes also make minor contributions. In hepatocyte incubations, oxidative and conjugative pathways were observed for all species examined, and indoline N-glucuronidation was the dominant pathway. Three less common and novel phase II conjugates of the indoline nitrogen were detected in hepatocytes and in microsomes supplemented with specific cofactors, including N-carbamoyl glucuronide, N-glucose, and N-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine. An N-glucuronide metabolite was the most frequently observed phase II conjugate in liver microsomes of all species, whereas the N-acetylglucosamine conjugate was observed only in monkey liver microsomes. Incubations with recombinant human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and inhibition by the UGT1A4 and UGT1A1 substrates/inhibitors imipramine and bilirubin suggested that UGT1A4 is the major UGT isozyme catalyzing the N-glucuronidation of motesanib, with a minor contribution from UGT1A1. The in vitro metabolic profiles were similar between the human and preclinical species examined. All metabolites found in humans were also detected in other species.",

However, accumulating evidence suggests that sirolimus potentially affects re-endothelialization, leading to late thrombosis. Statins have protective effects on endothelium. Recently, statins are reported to increase the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and accelerate re-endothelialization after vascular injury. Here, we tested the hypothesis that fluvastatin has beneficial effect on re-endothelialization after local sirolimus treatment. We performed wire-mediated vascular injury to both sides of femoral arteries of wild-type mice and bone marrow chimeric mice. Either sirolimus (100 microg) or DMSO was administered locally to the perivascular area of the injured arteries. All mice received either fluvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) or vehicle by gavage starting at one week before the surgery until sacrifice. At 4 weeks after the surgery, re-endothelialization of the sirolimus-treated artery was significantly less than that of DMSO-treated one in the vehicle-treated mice as determined by the percentage of CD31-positive area (P<0.05). Systemic administration of fluvastatin accelerated the re-endothelialization in the sirolimus-treated artery to the similar degree of that in the DMSO-treated artery (P=NS). Contribution of bone marrow-derived cells to re-endothelialization was seldom observed in bone marrow chimeric mice regardless of fluvastatin administration. Fluvastatin significantly ameliorated proliferation (2.5-folds) and migration activities (2.3-folds) of mature endothelial cells impaired by sirolimus treatment (P<0.05, respectively). Fluvastatin increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression in mature endothelial cell in the presence of sirolimus (P<0.05, respectively). Our findings suggest that fluvastatin has protective effects against impaired re-endothelialization after sirolimus treatment.",

Increasing evidence suggests a proatherogenic role for Lp-PLA2. Epidemiologic and clinical evidence suggests Lp-PLA2 is an independent predictor of risk and may be superior to other inflammatory markers owing to its specificity and minimal biovariation.

There was no difference in incidence of dementia in HPS 2002 (31 cases in simvastatin group, 31 cases in placebo group) nor in performance on the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status at final follow-up (23.7% simvastatin group cognitively impaired vs 24.2% in placebo group). There was no difference in cognition between groups either in relation to age at study entry or previous history of cerebrovascular disease. Cognitive function declined at the same rate in both treatment groups in PROSPER 2002, there was no significant difference between pravastatin treated and placebo groups in performance on letter digit codes, picture word learning test, Stroop and Mini Mental State Examination. There was no evidence that statins were detrimental to cognition.", 
    "181": "There is good evidence from RCTs that statins given in late life to individuals at risk of vascular disease have no effect in preventing AD or dementia. Biologically it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. Indication bias may have been a factor in these studies however and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative.", 
    "182": "D. salina is one of the recognized natural sources to produce beta-carotene, and an useful model for studying the role of inhibitors and enhancers of carotenogenesis. However there is little information in D. salina regarding whether the isoprenoid substrate can be influenced by stress factors (carotenogenic) or selective inhibitors which in turn may further contribute to elucidate the early steps of carotenogenesis and biosynthesis of beta-carotene. In this study, Dunaliella salina (BC02) isolated from La Salina BC Mexico, was subjected to the method of isoprenoids-beta-carotene interference in order to promote the interruption or accumulation of the programmed biosynthesis of carotenoids. When Carotenogenic and non-carotenogenic cells of D. salina BC02 were grown under photoautotrophic growth conditions in the presence of 200 microM fosmidomycin, carotenogenesis and the synthesis of beta-carotene were interrupted after two days in cultured D. salina cells. This result is an indirect consequence of the inhibition of the synthesis of isoprenoids and activity of the recombinant DXR enzyme thereby preventing the conversion of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) to 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol (MEP) and consequently interrupts the early steps of carotenogenesis in D. salina. The effect at the level of proteins and RNA was not evident. Mevinolin treated D. salina cells exhibited carotenogenesis and beta-carotene levels very similar to those of control cell cultures indicating that mevinolin not pursued any indirect action in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids and had no effect at the level of the HMG-CoA reductase, the key enzyme of the Ac/MVA pathway.", 
    "183": "In sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a severe prognostically relevant cardiac autonomic dysfunction exists, as manifested by a strong attenuation of sympathetically and vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV). The mechanisms underlying this attenuation are not limited to the nervous system. They also include alterations of the cardiac pacemaker cells on a cellular level. As shown in human atrial cardiomyocytes, endotoxin interacts with cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels, which mediate the pacemaker current If and play an important role in transmitting sympathetic and vagal signals on heart rate and HRV. Moreover, endotoxin sensitizes cardiac HCN channels to sympathetic signals. These findings identify endotoxin as a pertinent modulator of the autonomic nervous regulation of heart function. In MODS, the vagal pathway of the autonomic nervous system is particularly compromised, leading to an attenuation of the cholinergic antiinflammatory reflex. An amelioration of the blunted vagal activity appears to be a promising novel therapeutic target to achieve a suppression of the inflammatory state and thereby an improvement of prognosis in MODS patients. Preliminary data revealed therapeutic benefits (increased survival rates and improvements of the depressed vagal activity) of the administration of statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with MODS.", 
    "184": "Lipid-lowering treatment has been proven to decrease the rate of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with manifest coronary artery disease (CAD) or CAD equivalent risk profile. Current treatment guidelines recommend low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) less than 100 mg/dl (optional <70 mg/dl) as the target level for this high-risk population. Little is known about the ambulatory treatment of high-risk patients in clinical practice and the achievement of guideline recommended target values.", 
    "185": "In the '2L cardio' registry in Germany, 295 cardiologists enrolled 6711 consecutive patients with known CAD, and/or diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease (summarized as 'coronary risk equivalent', CE), on chronic statin treatment. They recorded actual LDL-C values at entry, probable changes in therapy, and the expected LDL-C values using a lipid calculator based on an earlier observational study in a similar setting. The three groups comprised 2618 patients with CAD plus CE (39.0%; median LDL-C 112 mg/dl), 3436 patients with CAD only (51.2%; median LDL-C 108 mg/dl), and 657 with CE only (9.8%; median LDL-C 124 mg/dl). They had LDL-C levels less than 100 mg/dl in 36.2% [95% confidence intervals (CI): 34.3-38.1], 39.7% (CI: 38.0-41.4), and 27.2% (CI: 23.7-30.7), respectively. Statin doses at entry were usually in the lower to intermediate range (e.g. simvastatin median 25 mg/day). Cardiologists switched to another statin in 10.1% (9.4-10.8), increased the dose of statins (if same drug) in 22.2% (CI: 21.1-23.2) and/or added a cholesterol absorption inhibitor in 23.7% (CI: 22.7-24.7) of the patients. The cardiologists' intervention improved expected LDL-C levels in the total cohort by a mean of 9.0 mg/dl, but the 100 mg/dl LDL-C target was only reached in 51.3% (CI: 50.0-52.5) of the total cohort. CE patients appeared undertreated in terms of antiplatelet drugs.", 
    "186": "Through infrequent increases in statin doses and mainly through add-on of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, cardiologists improved target level attainment. Compared with earlier studies in the outpatient setting, the treatment to target for LDL-C of high-risk CAD patients has improved, but is not satisfactory.", 
    "187": "Evidence about the efficacy of statin treatment among patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is very limited.

    "192": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant tumor suppressor syndrome, characterized by hamartomatous growths in the brain, skin, kidneys, lungs, and heart, which lead to significant morbidity. TSC is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, whose products, hamartin and tuberin, form a tumor suppressor complex that regulates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Early clinical trials show that TSC-related kidney tumors (angiomyolipomas) regress when treated with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus). Although side effects are tolerable, responses are incomplete, and tumor regrowth is common when rapamycin is stopped. Strategies for future clinical trials may include the investigation of longer treatment duration and combination therapy of other effective drug classes.", 
    "193": "Here, we examine the efficacy of a prolonged maintenance dose of rapamycin in Tsc2+/- mice with TSC-related kidney tumors. Cohorts were treated with rapamycin alone or in combination with interferon-gamma (IFN-g). The schedule of rapamycin included one month of daily doses before and after five months of weekly doses. We observed a 94.5% reduction in kidney tumor burden in Tsc2+/- mice treated (part one) daily with rapamycin (8 mg/kg) at 6 months <or= age < 7 months, (part 2) weekly with rapamycin (16 mg/kg) at 7 months <or= age < 12 months, and (part 3) daily with rapamycin (8 mg/kg) at 12 months <or= age < 13 months; but we did not observe any improvement with combination IFN-g plus rapamycin in this study. We also used a Tsc2-/- subcutaneous tumor model to evaluate other classes of drugs including sorafenib, atorvastatin, and doxycycline. These drugs were tested as single agents and in combination with rapamycin. Our results demonstrate that the combination of rapamycin and sorafenib increased survival and may decrease tumor volume as compared to rapamycin treatment alone while sorafenib as a single agent was no different than control. Atorvastatin and doxycycline, either as single agents or in combination with rapamycin, did not improve outcomes as compared with controls.", 
    "194": "Our results indicate that prolonged treatment with low doses of mTOR inhibitors may result in more complete and durable TSC-related tumor responses, and it would be reasonable to evaluate this strategy in a clinical trial.

We measured arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV)in brachial-ankle segments by automated oscillometry in 71 normotensive and normolipidaemic subjects with type 2 diabetes (40 males and 31 females). 57 patients (whose baPWV was more than 1400 cm/second) were randomised into two groups, group A (n=29) were given 10 mg atorvastatin daily for 6 months and group B (n=28) were given placebo. After 6 months, atorvastatin group had significant improvement in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) (1712.03 +/- 349.9 cm/second versus 1558.81 +/- 303.26 cm/ second, p< 0.05). Though the placebo group showed some improvement (1692.03 +/- 425.15 cm/second versus 1636.78 +/- 425.1 cm/second) it was not statistically significant. Despite correlation was noted between baPWV and systolic blood pressure (SBP), there was no significant correlation between the mean baPWV and duration of diabetes, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), waist to height ratio (WHtR), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), LDL, HDL cholesterol and spot urine albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) at the baseline. The decrement of LDL-cholesterol is correlated with the decrement of the baPWV in the atorvastatin group only (p<0.01).", 
    "200": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common condition that is increasing in prevalence in developed nations. The economic and psychosocial costs of CKD are considerable, and are associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality. Specific treatments do not exist for many causes of CKD. Therefore, treatment is reliant on the introduction of therapies that retard progression of structural renal damage and renal impairment. At present, aside from judicious use of antihypertensive agents to lower blood pressure, and possibly low-protein diets and statin therapy, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are the only widely available treatments. Although these measures attenuate the inexorable progression to renal failure, they do not halt it. One limiting factor may be feedback effects of ACEis and ARBs, such as increased plasma renin activity. Aliskiren is a newer agent that inhibits renin, the rate-limiting step in the RAAS. There are several theoretical reasons to suggest that aliskiren may have renoprotective actions superior to those of ACEis and ARBs. In this paper the available evidence regarding renoprotective effects of aliskiren is reviewed, with an emphasis on comparison with ACEis and ARBs.", 
    "201": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. The most popular agents for cholesterol reduction are the statin drugs, which are competitive inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the primary rate-limiting enzyme in the hepatic biosynthesis of cholesterol. Although relatively safe and effective, the available statins can cause elevations in liver enzymes and myopathy. Squalene synthase is another enzyme that is downstream to HMG-CoA reductase in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and modulates the first committed step of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis at the final branch point of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Squalene epoxidase and oxidosqualene cyclase are other enzymes that act distally to squalene synthase. Pharmacologic inhibitors of these downstream enzymes have been developed, which may reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and reduce the myopathy side effect seen with upstream inhibition of HMG-CoA. At this juncture, one squalene synthase inhibitor, lapaquistat (TAK-475) is in active clinical trials as a monotherapy, but there have been suggestions of increased hepatotoxicity with the drug.", 
    "202": "Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of mortality in the United States, with an incidence of 300,000 to 400,000 deaths annually. Despite advances in the management of cardiovascular disease, the only effective treatments proven to reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death are beta-adrenergic blockers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Antiarrhythmic medications are effective at treating symptomatic and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias, but several are associated with increased mortality. Although effective at lowering mortality, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators pose an economic burden and some morbidity to patients when associated with frequent shock therapies. Thus, there is renewed interest in developing additional pharmacologic alternatives that could reduce the risk of fatal ventricular arrhythmias. A post hoc analysis of 2 large clinical trials suggested an association between the use of lipid-altering therapy and decreased rates of sudden death. Retrospective review of other clinical trials and experimental data using animal models provide further insight into the potential antiarrhythmic properties of lipid-altering therapy. This review examines the current status of basic science and clinical research that explores the antiarrhythmic properties of lipid-altering therapy, with a focus on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and polyunsaturated fatty acids.",

    "207": "Recent data have shown that statins can help prevent atrial fibrillation (AF). We hypothesized that statins vary in their ability to prevent AF after successful electrical cardioversion (EC).Sixty-five patients (29 receiving atorvastatin and 36 receiving simvastatin) who had undergone successful EC for persistent AF were included in the study. They received statins at least one month before EC, and continued the treatment through 2 years of follow-up. The statins they received were selected independently by their attending physicians. In the follow-up period, AF reoccurred in 11 (38.0%) patients of the atorvastatin group and in 24 (66.7%) patients of the simvastatin group. Using a logistic regression model, the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of having an AF recurrence for patients on atorvastatin versus those on simvastatin was 0.31 (95% CI 0.11-0.85, P = 0.02). After adjustment for other potentially confounding variables (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, echocardiographic characteristics, and therapy), treatment with atorvastatin retained its significance for maintaining sinus rhythm in a multivariate model (OR 0.20, CI 0.04 to 0.98, P < 0.05).Our study suggests that atorvastatin and simvastatin exert different effects on the AF recurrence rate after successful EC. Larger prospective randomized trials are needed to definitively evaluate the role of different statins in patients with AF, especially on AF recurrence after EC.", 
    "208": "Most paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) ultimately becomes chronic atrial fibrillation (CAF), even in the presence of antiarrhythmic drugs. Upstream therapies such as calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), or statins have attracted attention for treating AF patients. We have previously reported that ACEI inhibited the progression of PAF to CAF. CCB and statins were also reported to inhibit the development of AF, but the follow-up periods in several of the papers appeared to be too short to allow a clear verdict on the antiarrhythmic effects. We therefore conducted a retrospective analysis of the relationship between long-term treatment (over 5 years) with an ACEI, CCB, or statin and outcome in patients with PAF (n = 125).The follow-up period was 7.7 +/- 3.1 years. Class I antiarrhythmic drugs were prescribed for 76.6% of the patients, ACEI for 36.0%, CCB for 47.2%, and statins for 20.0%. We assessed the cardiac rhythm from the medical records or electrocardiograms and determined the time from the first visit to the development of CAF. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the use of an ACEI significantly decreased the cumulative probability of CAF, while class I antiarrhythmics, CCB, and statins did not inhibit progression to CAF. Multivariate analysis showed that only ACEI was related to a reduced progression to CAF (odds ratio, 0.112; 95% confidence interval, 0.034 to 0.374, P = 0.001). Class I antiarrhythmic drugs, CCBs, and statins showed no such association.ACEI thus appear to be superior to CCB or statins with respect to upstream therapy.",

Consequently, national treatment guidelines suggest that combination therapy may be necessary to address multiple lipid targets and adding niacin or a fibrate to a statin is a strategy to be considered.

CEA is also recommended in asymptomatic men <75 years old with 70-99% stenosis if the perioperative stroke/death risk is <3% [A]. The benefit from CEA in asymptomatic women is significantly less than in men [A]. CEA should therefore be considered only in younger, fit women [A]. Carotid patch angioplasty is preferable to primary closure [A]. Aspirin at a dose of 75-325 mg daily and statins should be given before, during and following CEA. [A] Carotid artery stenting (CAS) should be performed only in high-risk for CEA patients, in high-volume centres with documented low peri-operative stroke and death rates or inside a randomized controlled trial [C]. CAS should be performed under dual antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel [A]. Carotid protection devices are probably of benefit [C]."
