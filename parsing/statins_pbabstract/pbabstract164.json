    "1": "Patients with PAD on ASA therapy at baseline were included from the ongoing Effect of Lipid Modification on Peripheral Arterial Disease after Endovascular Intervention Trial (ELIMIT), which is a randomized trial testing whether combination treatment with ezetimibe, niacin, and a statin will halt/regress atherosclerosis compared with statin monotherapy. Patients who had baseline platelet testing and repeat testing at 6-month or 12-month follow-up were included. ASA responsiveness was tested using three different assays: Optical aggregation with 0.5 mg/mL of arachidonic acid (AA), optical aggregation with 10 \u03bcM of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and platelet function analyzer-100 (PFA-100) testing with collagen/epinephrine (Epi) loaded cartridges. ASA response was defined as AA aggregation <30%, ADP aggregation <70%, or PFA-100 Epi >164 seconds. Patients who showed response to ASA at baseline were classified as Responders. Poor response to ASA was defined as AA aggregation \u2265 30%, ADP aggregation \u2265 70%, or PFA-100 Epi \u2264 164 seconds. Patients who showed poor response (PR) to an assay at baseline, but then were responsive at follow-up visits were classified as Initial PRs. Patients who showed poor response at baseline and all follow-up visits were classified as Persistent PRs. The classification agreement between assays was tested using the kappa statistic.",

Regarding the agreement of the assays, only AA aggregation and PFA-100 Epi agreed significantly (K = 0.3223; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.493; P = .0001), and though statistically significant, the magnitude of this agreement is small. AA aggregation and ADP aggregation did not agree (K = 0.1161; 95% CI -0.004-0.236; P = .029), nor did ADP aggregation and PFA-100 Epi (K = 0.0044; 95% CI -0.151-0.160; P = .48).",

Of the high-risk participants, 44% recalled their increased coronary heart disease risk. South Asian high-risk participants were less likely to recall than White high-risk participants (odds ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.93). Furthermore, high risk participants with middle (odds ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.89) and low (odds ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.37-0.74) employment grades were less likely to recall than those with high grades.",

    "10": "The levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were significant determinants of cholesterol efflux capacity but accounted for less than 40% of the observed variation. An inverse relationship was noted between efflux capacity and carotid intima-media thickness both before and after adjustment for the HDL cholesterol level. Furthermore, efflux capacity was a strong inverse predictor of coronary disease status (adjusted odds ratio for coronary disease per 1-SD increase in efflux capacity, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59 to 0.83; P<0.001). This relationship was attenuated, but remained significant, after additional adjustment for the HDL cholesterol level (odds ratio per 1-SD increase, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.90; P=0.002) or apolipoprotein A-I level (odds ratio per 1-SD increase, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.89; P=0.002).

The increased serum levels of C-reactive protein, TNF, VEGF, IL-6, and ICAM-1 were known in patients with COPD. The accelerated pulse wave velocity(PWV) and the increased intima-media thickness of internal jugular artery were significantly found in the patients, when compared with the smokers without COPD. The anti-atherogenic agents including statins and ARBs are reported to be effective for the reduced mortality in the patients. The possibility of COPD as a novel atherogenic factor is discussed.", 
    "13": "Atherosclerosis is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents a major cause of death in these patients, especially, in patients with end-stage renal disease(ESRD). The pathological features in ESRD patients are intimal atherosclerosis and medial calcific sclerosis. The important risk factors for CVD in ESRD patients are hypertension, dyslipidemia and CKD bone and mineral disorder (CKD-MBD). Atherosclerosis has been evaluated by measurements of intima-media thickness and pulse-wave velocity. Although the target blood pressure still undetermined, hypertension would be treated with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. In addition, treatment of dyslipidemia with statins may lead to favorable CVD outcome. Finally, inhibition of vascular calcification should be important by treatment with active vitamin D and sevelamer.",

In addition to life-style modifications, new drugs against atherosclerotic and inflammatory vascular diseases are expected. In current clinical trials, phospholipase A2 inhibitors(darapladib, varespladib), RVX-208, D-4F, CETP inhibitors (anacetrapib, dalcetrapib), succinobucol are investigated. Some has been failed, but others are still promising. On molecular target basis of PAF-AH, CETP, PON, ABC transporters of A1 and G1, SR-BI, HO-1, potential benefits and side effects are discussed.", 
    "15": "Oxidized LDL accelerates vascular endothelial damage and the progression of early arteriosclerosis, and is known as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. In this study, we administered pioglitazone and pitavastatin for 16 weeks to 18 patients who had type 2 diabetes complicated by dyslipidemia and then investigated the influence of these 2 drugs on MDA-LDL(i. e., oxidized LDL). As a result, a significant decrease of MDA-LDL was observed in both groups, but a significant decrease of the MDA-LDL/LDL-C ratio (an indicator of the extent of oxidation of LDL) was only observed in the pioglitazone group. Accordingly, it was demonstrated that pioglitazone improves oxidative stress, and the possibility was suggested that the MDA-LDL/LDL-C ratio is useful for the evaluation of oxidative stress in clinical practice.", 
    "16": "Inflammation plays a central role in the development of atherosclerosis and plaque rupture. Statin not only inhibits cholesterol synthesis but also elicits pleiotropic effects by blocking mevalonate pathyway and the isoprenylation of small GTPases which are involved in vascular responses. High sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is a prognostic biomarker for vascular inflammation. JUPITER trial focusing on hsCRP has shown that inflammation is a key player for cardiovascular disease independent of cholesterol levels. Japanese clinical trials of MEGA and MUSASHI-AMI also demonstrated that statin is beneficial for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events via both cholesterol-lowering and pleiotropic effects. Our recent animal study of intravenous administration of pravastatin supports the rapid pleiotropic effects of statin beyond cholesterol-lowering.",

    "18": "The clinical and epidemiological importance of cardiovascular diseases, which primarily involve vascular lesions, has increased rapidly in recent years. Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity, which serve as a basis for the development of atherosclerosis, are induced by a genetic predisposition coupled with environmental factors. High plasma LDL cholesterol level has important effects on the process of atherosclerosis because, not only are vascular endothelial cells injured, they actually supply LDL cholesterol which is then deposited in the vascular wall. Treatment of hypercholesterolemia with statin significantly reduces the cholesterol level in plaques and normalizes the function of vascular endothelial cells, leading to plaque stabilization and preventing cardiovascular events.", 
    "19": "Angioplasty in patients with renal artery stenosis aims at reducing blood pressure and at improving kidney function. Its efficacy has however been questioned by recent published data. It was the aim of this retrospective study to compare angioplasty with medical treatment in an unselected patient population.",

The data included blood pressure, creatinine-based calculated glomerular filtration rate (cGFR), any renal dialysis, cardiovascular risk factors, events and survival time after transluminal renal angioplasty or drug treatment, respectively.", 
    "21": "Patients who had undergone angioplasty were younger (p = 0.04), had less cardiovascular co-morbidity (p < 0.01), but a higher degree of stenosis (p < 0.01). After a median follow-up of 32.5 (angioplasty) and 36.0 months (drug treatment), respectively, a significant decrease of cGFR was recorded in drug treated patients (- 16.2 ml/min, 95 %, CI - 25.7 to - 6.7) but not in the angioplasty group (- 4.5 ml/min, 95 %, CI - 13.5 to 4.5). There were no other significant differences were not observed.",

    "23": "There are three strategies for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD): medical therapy, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). With the development of drug-eluting stents, PCI is now widely used as the firstline treatment around the world. The advantage of CABG over PCI, however, remains in patients with left main coronary artery disease, three-vessel disease, and diffuse CAD. PCI and CABG do not exist in isolation because relieving the symptoms of angina is not the goal of treatment of CAD. Secondary prevention with vigorous modification of risk factors should be initiated and maintained. Among coronary risk factors, diabetes mellitus (DM) remains the most important one to predict poor early and late outcomes even in patients undergoing complete revascularization with CABG. Lowering the blood glucose level is important, but strict glycemic control is not necessarily associated with further reduction of cardiovascular events. Modification of insulin resistance with pioglitazone and metformin, lipid-lowering therapy with a statin, lowering blood pressure to <130/80 mmHg, and antiplatelet therapy should be considered in individuals with DM. A major concern is suboptimal modifications of risk factors in patients with DM and CABG in the real world. We should bear in mind this treatment gap and provide medical therapy for patients who need it most.", 
    "24": "Statins have recently been shown to act as protectants against several neuropathological conditions. They have received special attention in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where epidemiological studies indicating a lower prevalence of AD/dementia in statin-prescribed populations. Excitotoxicity, which derives from the overstimulation of glutamate receptors, is a major cause of neuron death in several neurological diseases, including AD and epilepsy. We have carried out a comparative study to investigate the effects of all the commercially available statins (simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin) on neuron damage and memory impairment. To this end, we studied neurodegeneration in a mouse model by systemic administration of kainate. Simvastatin was the most effective statin in reducing the deleterious effects caused by kainate, including the severity of seizures, excitotoxicity, oxidative damage, neuritic dystrophy and apoptosis in the hippocampus and other limbic structures of the brain cortex. Lovastatin was the second most efficient statin in preventing seizures and histopathological signs of excitotoxicity, whilst fluvastatin, pravastatin, and atorvastatin showed neither antiepileptic nor neuroprotective effects. Only simvastatin enhanced episodic-like memory. To the best of our knowledge this is the first in vivo study to analyze the neuroprotective effect of all the commercially available statins. Our results suggest that both simvastatin and lovastatin (but especially simvastatin) may well have therapeutic potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases involving excitotoxicity and memory impairment, including AD.", 
    "25": "The aim of our study was to compare the effect of simvastatin on systemic inflammation and monocyte secretory function between subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and isolated hypercholesterolemia. We studied 26 patients with isolated IGT and 24 subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia, who were treated for 12 weeks with 20 mg of simvastatin daily. Plasma lipids, fasting and 2-h post-glucose load plasma glucose levels, HOMA ratio, glycated hemoglobin, plasma hsCRP levels and monocyte release of interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u03b2, MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 were determined at entry, and after 4 and 12 weeks days of simvastatin administration. The control group included 25 age-, sex- and weight-matched dyslipidemia-free individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Compared to the control subjects, monocytes of both IGT and hypercholesterolemic subjects released greater amounts of interleukin-6, interleukin-1\u03b2, MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1, and exhibited increased plasma hsCRP levels. No differences between IGT and hypercholesterolemic subjects in cytokine release and plasma hsCRP were observed. Despite improving lipid profile, simvastatin did not produce any effect on glucose metabolism markers in any treatment groups. In hypercholesterolemic subjects simvastatin reduced plasma hsCRP and monocyte cytokine secretion in a lipid- and glucose-independent manner, while in IGT subjects the drug produced only insignificant changes. Our results show that although low-grade systemic inflammation and monocyte secretory function are disturbed to a similar extent in isolated hypercholesterolemia and IGT, simvastatin exhibits a strong anti-inflammatory effect only in hypercholesterolemic patients.", 
    "26": "Omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3 FA) and statins exhibit besides lipid-lowering effects the antiarrhythmic ability in clinic, while definite mechanisms are not yet elucidated. Our goal was to examine whether these compounds can modulate inducibility of hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) rat heart to ventricular fibrillation (VF) and myocardial cell-to-cell coupling protein connexin-43 (Cx43). HTG and healthy Wistar rats were orally treated with omega-3 FA(30 mg/100 g/day/2 mth) and atorvastatin (Ato, 0.5 mg/100 g/day/2 mth) and compared to untreated rats. Susceptibility of the heart to electrically-inducible VF and functional parameters were monitored using Langendorff-perfused isolated heart. Ventricular tissues from treated and untreated HTG and Wistar rat hearts were processed for ultrastructure examination as well as for analysis of myocardial Cx43 distribution and expression using antiCx43 MAB, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Both, omega-3 FA and atorvastatin reduced elevated blood pressure, triglycerides and heart rate in HTG rats. Compared to Wistar the threshold to induce VF was lower in HTG rat hearts, which exhibited abnormal Cx43 distribution, decreased immunostaining and elevated phosphorylated form of Cx43. In contrast, an enhancement of immunostaining of Cx43, suppression of hyperphosphorylation of Cx43 and improvement of cardiomyocyte and intercellular junction integrity by omega-3 FA and atorvastatin was associated with a significant increase of threshold for VF. Moreover, treatment resulted in up-regulation of myocardial Cx43 and increase of VF threshold in healthy rats that was associated with up-regulation of Cx43. Results indicate that antiarrhythmic effects of omega-3 FA and atorvastatin are linked with modulation of expression and/or phosphorylation of Cx43 and protection of cardiomyocyte and cell-to-cell junction integrity. As both compounds are ligands for PPAR, a possible regulation of Cx43 gene expression and pathways involved in Cx43 phosphorylation should be investigated.", 
    "27": "Statins are a widely prescribed class of cholesterol lowering drugs whose use is frequently associated with muscle-related ailments. A number of mechanisms have been implicated in statin-induced myotoxicity including alterations in both protein synthesis and protein degradation. The objective of the present study was to explore the mechanism(s) contributing to the statin-induced reduction in protein synthesis in the muscle-derived C\u2082C\u2081\u2082 cell line. Cells were treated with 10 \u03bcM simvastatin or vehicle alone for 24 h in 1% serum. Cells exposed to simvastatin exhibited reduced rates of protein synthesis, as evidenced by [(35)S]methionine and [(35)S]cysteine incorporation into protein. The reduction in protein synthesis occurred with a concomitant decrease in expression and activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B), a regulated and rate-controlling guanine nucleotide exchange factor known to affect global rates of protein synthesis. The reductions in protein synthesis and eIF2B expression were prevented by coincubation with mevalonate. Simvastatin treatment also resulted in a proteasome-sensitive reduction in the protein expression of all the subunits of the eIF2B heteropentameric complex. Finally, increased phosphorylation of the catalytic \u03b5-subunit at Ser(535) was observed, an event consistent with an observed reduction in eIF2B activity. These results suggest that repression of eIF2B expression and activity may contribute, at least in part, to the statin-induced reduction in protein synthesis.", 
    "28": "We examined the association between rate of cholesterol esterification in plasma depleted of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (FER(HDL)), atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) [(log (TG/HDL-C)], concentrations, and size of lipoproteins and changes in coronary artery stenosis in participants in the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study. A total of 160 patients was treated with simvastatin (S), niacin (N), antioxidants (A) and placebo (P) in four regimens. FER(HDL) was measured using a radioassay; the size and concentration of lipoprotein subclasses were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The S+N and S+N+A therapy decreased AIP and FER(HDL), reduced total VLDL (mostly the large and medium size particles), decreased total LDL particles (mostly the small size), and increased total HDL particles (mostly the large size). FER(HDL) and AIP correlated negatively with particle sizes of HDL and LDL, positively with VLDL particle size, and closely with each other (r = 0.729). Changes in the proportions of small and large lipoprotein particles, which were reflected by FER(HDL) and AIP, corresponded with findings on coronary angiography. Logistic regression analysis of the changes in the coronary stenosis showed that probability of progression was best explained by FER(HDL) (P = 0.005). FER(HDL) and AIP reflect the actual composition of the lipoprotein spectrum and thus predict both the cardiovascular risk and effectiveness of therapy. AIP is already available for use in clinical practice as it can be readily calculated from the routine lipid profile.", 
    "29": "RhoB is an early-response gene whose expression is elevated by multiple cellular stresses; this gene plays an important role in cancer, macrophage motility, and apoptosis. These factors are essential for the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus and related complications. This study explores the role of RhoB in \u03b2-cell depletion and hyperglycemia-associated complications and tests whether the pleiotropic effect of statins on glycemic control is RhoB dependent. We induced \u03b2-cell depletion in RhoB(+/+), RhoB(+/-), and RhoB(-/-) mice with streptozotocin (STZ). Diabetic status was assessed by glucose tolerance and pancreatic islet loss. RhoB(-/-) mice showed a significant reduction in the severity of STZ-induced diabetes; only 13% of the STZ-treated RhoB-null animals became hyperglycemic, as opposed to 61% of the wild-type controls. Diabetes-related complications, such as wound healing rate and onset of nephropathy, were also assessed. Hyperglycemic RhoB(-/-) mice had fewer signs of nephropathy and showed faster wound healing than RhoB(+/+) animals. After assessing the diabetic status of mice treated simultaneously with STZ and simvastatin, we conclude that the effect of statins in improving glycemic control is RhoB independent. We propose that RhoB is a modifier of diabetes, important for the induction of \u03b2-cell loss. Suppression of RhoB expression may have potential application in the treatment of diabetes and associated complications.",

The primary endpoints were the percentage changes in LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio.", 
    "32": "Both ROS and PIT lowered LDL-C and triglyceride, and increased HDL-C. In particular, significantly greater reduction in LDL-C was seen with ROS (-44.1%) than with PIT (-36.9%, P<0.01) in the crossover group from ROS to PIT, and the same result was detected in the crossover group from PIT (-34.8%) to ROS (-44.7%). The ratio of LDL-C/HDL-C was significantly reduced with ROS treatment (from 3.45 to 1.85) compared with that with PIT (from 3.45 to 2.22, P<0.01). Both ROS and PIT lowered plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In addition, the hsCRP level with the administration of ROS was significantly improved compared with the administration of PIT. There was no significant correlation between changes in LDL-C and hsCRP, TNF-alpha, and PAI-1 levels. ROS and PIT did not have an adverse effect on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients.",

    "34": "Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is an intractable disease of the small PAs in which multiple pathogenic factors are involved. Statins are known to mitigate endothelial injury and inhibit vascular remodeling and inflammation, all of which play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of PAH. We tested the hypothesis that nanoparticle (NP)-mediated delivery of pitavastatin into the lungs can be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of PAH. Among the marketed statins, pitavastatin was found to have the most potent effects on proliferation of PA smooth muscle cells in vitro. We formulated pitavastatin-NP and found that pitavastatin-NP was more effective than pitavastatin alone in inhibiting cellular proliferation and inflammation in vitro. In a rat model of monocrotaline-induced PAH, a single intratracheal instillation of NP resulted in the delivery of NP into alveolar macrophages and small PAs for up to 14 days after instillation. Intratracheal treatment with pitavastatin-NP, but not with pitavastatin, attenuated the development of PAH and was associated with a reduction of inflammation and PA remodeling. NP-mediated pitavastatin delivery was more effective than systemic administration of pitavastatin in attenuating the development of PAH. Importantly, treatment with pitavastatin-NP 3 weeks after monocrotaline injection induced regression of PAH and improved survival rate. This mode of NP-mediated pitavastatin delivery into the lungs is effective in attenuating the development of PAH and inducing regression of established PAH, suggesting potential clinical significance for developing a new treatment for PAH.",

This net benefit persisted even at the lower 95% confidence interval of the relative risk of statin-associated ICH. In patients with lobar ICH who had prior cardiovascular events, the annual recurrence risk of myocardial infarction would have to exceed 90% to favor statin therapy.

Candidate serum biomarkers for earlier AAA diagnosis include D-dimer, fibrinogen, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, lipoprotein(a), and the proteolytic enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases. Furthermore, biomarkers such as brain natriuretic peptide significantly stratify perioperative risk in AAA repair. Statins significantly improve outcomes after AAA repair. They may also significantly slow AAA growth to allow pharmacologic arrest of AAA development. Recent trials have focused attention on fluid management for AAA repair. Although restrictive fluid management may significantly improve clinical outcomes, current evidence does not clearly support crystalloid or colloid for AAA repair. There may be an increased risk of renal dysfunction associated with hetastarch therapy. Endovascular repair has revolutionized the clinical management of AAAs. Recent trials have shown its significant outcome advantages. Furthermore, it is also applicable in high-risk operative cohorts and, in the future, may be suited for earlier AAA repair. This technology continues to advance with the development of branched and fenestrated grafts as well as total percutaneous endovascular AAA repair.

There are however still very sparse data on how individual statins interact with the production of vasoactive eicosanoids and nitric oxide (NO) in human vascular endothelial cells. Here we have determined how fluvastatin affects the mRNA expression of genes associated with vascular reactivity as well as the formation of two major vasodilators, prostacyclin (PGI2) and NO, in human endothelial cells. Also, the influence of fluvastatin on arterial resistance was assessed in isolated small arteries. We show that the promoter activity of prostacyclin synthase (PTGIS), the mRNA expression of PTGIS and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and the production of PGI2 and NO are significantly induced by fluvastatin. Also, strong rapid dilatation ex vivo was observed, with the equal contribution of PGI2 and NO. Our findings in cell culture experiments and in isolated human arteries indicate that fluvastatin-evoked endothelium-derived vasodilator production may confer protection of the endothelial cells via both acute and long-term effects of fluvastatin treatment. If these effects take place in vivo, we suggest a protective pleiotropic role of fluvastatin on the cardiovascular system, particularly at the level of the vascular endothelium, to ameliorate the process of atherogenesis and in the acute manner to reduce vascular tone.",

SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase, can induce gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether fructose increased hepatic SIRT1, leading to induction of gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Rat hepatocytes were incubated with fructose (1-5 mM). SIRT1 protein, SIRT1 activity, and NAD(+)/NADH ratio were measured. The effects of SIRT1 inhibitors (EX-527 and nicotinamide) and activators (SIRT1 activator 3 and SRT1720) and the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone were examined on fructose-induced increases in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis. Fructose increased SIRT1 protein, SIRT1 activity, and NAD(+)/NADH ratio. Fructose also induced gluconeogenesis, with increases in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1\u03b1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; gene code Pck1) gene expression, PEPCK activity, and hepatocyte glucose production. In addition, levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Hmgcr) and acetyl-coA carboxylase (Acc) mRNA, and intracellular cholesterol were increased. Increases in gluconeogenesis, Hmgcr, Acc, and cholesterol were abolished by SIRT1 inhibitors and rotenone, while SIRT1 activators increased gluconeogenesis, Hmgcr, Acc, Pgc1\u03b2, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (Srebp1c) gene expression. In conclusion, fructose induces gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis through a SIRT1-dependent mechanism, suggesting that induction of hepatic SIRT1 could play a pivotal role in the metabolic changes observed in humans and animals consuming a fructose-rich diet. These results highlight the need for a greater understanding of the role of SIRT1 in metabolic regulation and indicate the potential for adverse effects of SIRT1 activators if used therapeutically.",

Besides research efforts to improve the efficacy and safety of conventional antiarrhythmic agents, therapies directed 'upstream'of the electrical aspects of AF, towards the underlying anatomical substrate and atrial remodelling, have been proposed as new pharmacological therapeutic approaches. Potential upstream therapies for AF comprise a variety of agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), statins, N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and steroids. On the basis of experimental data, clinical studies have provided information on the potential of upstream therapy for the prevention of AF across a broad spectrum of cardiovascular patient groups. In patients with heart failure or hypertension, data are sufficient to support the use of ACEI or ARB as treatment that may decrease the risk of AF beyond their other beneficial effects. Similarly, it is highly possible that the use of statin in patients with a recognized indication may be associated with a benefit against AF. However, in most clinical settings, the evidence appears to be insufficient to drive changes in therapy management per se, and large-scale, randomized controlled trials with adequately defined endpoints are still needed. The results from these trials may help to understand the complex mechanisms that lead to AF, and may clarify the benefit-to-risk ratio of these new therapeutic approaches.",

In conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that in high-risk patients with ACS undergoing an early invasive strategy, upstream administration of Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors does not improve clinical outcome compared to a downstream selective administration, and it is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding complications. Therefore, a strategy of upstream Gp IIb/IIIa inhibitors cannot be recommended.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of premature discontinuation of oral antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation and to evaluate its effects on long-term prognosis. We studied 1,358 consecutive patients successfully treated with drug-eluting stents and discharged with dual oral antiplatelet therapy. Aspirin was to be maintained lifelong, and clopidogrel was prescribed for 12 months. The patients were followed for 36 months. The prevalence and predictors of aspirin and clopidogrel discontinuation were assessed. Major adverse cardiac events, defined as death, myocardial infarction, destabilizing symptoms leading to hospitalization, and nonfatal stroke, were recorded. Definite, probable, and possible stent thrombosis (ST) and major and minor bleeding were also determined. Of the 1,358 patients, 8.8% had discontinued one or both antiplatelet agents within the first 12 months (\"early\" discontinuation) and 4.8% had discontinued aspirin after 1 year (\"late\" discontinuation). Early discontinuation was predicted by in-hospital major bleeding, the use of oral anticoagulants at discharge, and the lack of a statin prescription. Previous stroke was the only independent predictor of late discontinuation. Patients with early discontinuation experienced a greater incidence of major adverse cardiac events (28.6% vs 13.7%, p <0.001) and ST (7.6% vs 3.4%, p = 0.038). All-cause mortality (13.4% vs 4.7%, p <0.001) and cardiovascular death (5% vs 1.2%, p = 0.007) were significantly more frequent among patients with early discontinuation. In patients with late discontinuation, a nonstatistically significant increase was seen in major adverse cardiac events (20% vs 13.3%, p = 0.128) and ST (6.2% vs 3.2%, p = 0.275).

Intervention assignments were as follows: (a) atorvastatin 20 mg qd; (b) sulindac 150 mg bid; (c) oligofructose-enriched inulin (as ORAFTI\u00aeSynergy1) 6 gm bid; or (d) control (maltodextrin) 6 gm bid, for 6 months. Percent change in rectal ACF number (%\u0394ACF) within arm was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included changes in proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (caspase-3), as measured from normal mucosa biopsy samples. Among 85 eligible randomized subjects, 76 (86%) completed the trial per protocol. The median (range) of rectal ACF was 9 (5-34) and 8 (0-37) at baseline and postintervention, respectively. The median (SD) for %\u0394ACF was 5.6 (-69% to 143%), -18.6 (-83% to 160%), -3.6 (-88% to 83%), and -10.0 (-100% to 117%) in the atorvastatin, sulindac, ORAFTI\u00aeSynergy1 and control arms, respectively. Neither within-arm (P = 0.12-0.59) nor between-arm (P = 0.30-0.92) comparisons of %\u0394ACF were statistically significant. The active and control interventions also seemed to have similar effects on mucosal proliferation and apoptosis (P > 0.05 for each comparison). Data from this multicenter, phase II trial do not provide convincing evidence of CRC risk reduction from 6-month interventions with atorvastatin, sulindac, or ORAFTI\u00aeSynergy1, although statistical power was limited by the relatively small sample size.",

We prospectively investigated whether the use of statins was associated with a reduced risk of development of depression in individuals who have had a cardiac event or intervention.", 
    "99": "Participants were recruited between May 2005 and March 2006 from the Geelong Hospital, Geelong, Australia, a tertiary hospital in regional Australia that serves a catchment area shown to be representative of the broader Australian community. Patients who were hospitalized for angioplasty, myocardial infarction, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (N = 193) were followed up prospectively for 9 months to assess development of depression. Depression data were collected 3 months postdischarge (T1) by structured clinical interview (using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 5) and 9 months postdischarge (T2) by self-report (using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Major depressive disorder, minor depression, and dysthymia were diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria. Data on statins were collected from medical records. The association between statin therapy and depression was tested using both linear and logistic regression models controlling for clinical, psychological, and demographic confounders.", 
    "100": "At discharge, 157 participants (81.3%) were receiving statin therapy. Adjusting for possible confounders, taking statins at discharge had a protective effect on depression at T1, reducing the likelihood of dysthymia, minor depression, or major depression by 69% (95% CI, 0.097-0.972; P = .045). At the T2 end point, statin therapy again had a protective effect and was associated with a 79% reduction in the likelihood of depression (95% CI, 0.052-0.876; P = .032). The linear regression model to predict depression at T2 was significantly different from zero (F(11,180) = 8.686, P < .001) and explained 36.3% of the variance in depression.",

This supports the role of oxidative and inflammatory processes in depression and opens the door to rational and novel pathophysiologically based therapies distinct from conventional antidepressants.", 
    "102": "Oxidative stress is thought to play an important role in atherogenesis. The statin group of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events and possess antioxidant properties. We aimed to assess the effects of simvastatin on a novel measure of prooxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) in dyslipidemic patients. The PAB assay can measure the prooxidant burden and the antioxidant capacity simultaneously in one assay, thereby giving a redox index. We treated 102 dyslipidemic individuals with simvastatin, or a placebo in a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial. PAB values were measured before and after each treatment period. Seventy-seven subjects completed the study. We found that statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in PAB values (P < 0.001). This effect appeared to be independent of the cholesterol-lowering effects of statins. We conclude that serum PAB values are decreased by simvastatin therapy. Regarding previous reports on the elevation of PAB in conditions associated with oxidative stress, the PAB assay, along with other markers of oxidative stress, may be applied to estimate the extent of oxidative stress in patients, assessment of the antioxidative efficacy of medication such as statins and perhaps also for the identification of those individuals who need antioxidant therapy.", 
    "103": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become a global health concern and is one of the leading causes of cancer death after lung and gastric cancers. It has been suggested that the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutarylcoenzyme-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin exhibits anticancer properties. To this end, we analyzed the influence of simvastatin on the cell growth and adhesion of HCC and evaluated the yet poorly characterized mechanism of action of simvastatin in HCC. HepG2 and Huh7 cells were treated with simvastatin (16-64 \u03bcM) for different time periods. Cell proliferation using the MTT assay and tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cell monolayers were evaluated. \u00df1, \u00df3 and \u03b12 integrin adhesion receptors and the downstream target of simvastatin Rho-dependent kinase (ROCK) were analyzed by Western blot. Further blocking studies with the ROCK-inhibitor H1152 and anti-integrin \u00df1 and \u00df3 antibodies were carried out. Simvastatin treatment inhibited dose-dependently tumor cell growth and attachment to endothelium. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on cell adhesion was associated with decreased expression of \u00df1, \u00df3 and \u03b12 integrins. Furthermore, simvastatin strongly reduced the expression of ROCK-I and activated MYPT, an indicator of ROCK activity. Also, the ROCK-inhibitor H1152 reduced the adhesive capacity of the tumor cells. Anti-adhesive effects of simvastatin were prevented by exogenous mevalonate, a downstream product of HMG-CoA. Tumor cell adhesion to endothelium was significantly impaired following incubation with functional anti-\u00df1 antibody. Simvastatin modifies the expression of cell adhesion molecules leading to reduced tumor cell growth and invasion. These beneficial effects of simvastatin may be mediated by ROCK. The data presented may point to novel treatment options for HCC.", 
    "104": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP/Oatp) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1/Mdr1) in intestinal absorption of pitavastatin. Pitavastatin was found to be a substrate for human OATP1A2, OATP2B1, and MDR1 and rat Oatp1a5, Oatp2b1, and Mdr1a in experiments using transporter-expressing Xenopus oocytes and LLC-PK1 cell systems. Naringin inhibited Oatp1a5- and Mdr1a-mediated transport of pitavastatin with IC(50) values of 18.5 and 541 \u00b5M, respectively. The difference in the IC(50) values of naringin for Oatp1a5 and Mdr1a-mediated pitavastatin transport may account for the complex concentration-dependent effect of naringin on the intestinal absorption of pitavastatin. Rat intestinal permeability of pitavastatin measured by the in situ closed-loop perfusion method was indeed significantly reduced by 200 \u00b5M naringin, but was significantly increased by 1000 \u00b5M naringin. Furthermore, the permeability was significantly increased by elacridar, a potent inhibitor of Mdr1, while the permeability was significantly decreased in the presence of both elacridar and naringin, suggesting that Oatp1a5 and Mdr1a are both involved in intestinal absorption of pitavastatin. Our present results indicate that OATP/Oatp and MDR1/Mdr1 play roles in the intestinal absorption of pitavastatin as influx and efflux transporters, respectively.",

Studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of anacetrapib and dalcetrapib concluded that both agents safely and effectively augment HDL-C. Their mechanism of action, potential for significant raising of HDL-C, once-daily dosing regimen, and favorable lipid-altering effects when added to hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors are key elements. Anacetrapib and dalcetrapib are well tolerated, with mild gastrointestinal complaints reported more than with placebo.

Diabetic dyslipidaemia is characterized by elevated triglycerides, low total high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. The most important therapeutic goal in diabetic dyslipidaemia is correction of the non-HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) level. Glycaemic control with particular attention to postprandial glucose control plays a role not only in improving dyslipidaemia but also in lowering cardiac events. Pioglitazone is particularly effective for improving the manifestations of diabetic dyslipidaemia, in addition to its favorable effects on systemic inflammation and hyperglycaemia. Use of statins in addition to lifestyle change is recommended in most if not all type 2 diabetic patients and the goal should be to lower the LDL to a level recommended for the patient with existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) (non-HDL-C level <100 mg/dl). In addition, therapies for normalization of HDL and triglyceride levels should be deployed. Most patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) will require combining a lipid-lowering therapy with therapeutic lifestyle changes to achieve optimal lipid levels. Combinations usually include two or more of the following: a statin, nicotinic acid, omega-3 fats and bile acid sequestrants (BASs).

Here, we report that simvastatin acts as an inhibitor of osteolysis in a mouse model of breast cancer skeletal metastasis of human mammary cancer cell MDA-MB-231, which expresses the mutant p53R280K. Simvastatin and lovastatin attenuated migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 breast tumor cells in culture. Acquisition of phenotype to express the cancer stem cell marker, CD44, leads to invasive potential of the tumor cells. Interestingly, statins significantly decreased the expression of CD44 protein via a transcriptional mechanism. shRNA-mediated down-regulation of CD44 markedly reduced the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in culture. We identified that in the MDA-MB-231 cells, simvastatin elevated the levels of mutated p53R280K, which was remarkably active as a transcription factor. shRNA-derived inhibition of mutant p53R280K augmented the expression of CD44, leading to increased migration and invasion. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse correlation between expression of p53 and CD44 in the tumors of mice that received simvastatin.

    "150": "Zn[2]-Cys[6] binuclear transcription factors Upc2p and Ecm22p regulate the expression of genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and exogenous sterol uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified two UPC2/ECM22 homologues in the pathogenic fungus Candida glabrata which we designated CgUPC2A and CgUPC2B. The contribution of these two genes to sterol homeostasis was investigated. Cells that lack CgUPC2A (upc2A\u0394) exhibited enhanced susceptibility to the sterol biosynthesis inhibitors, fluconazole and lovastatin, whereas upc2B\u0394-mutant cells were as susceptible to the drugs as wild-type cells. The growth of upc2A\u0394 cells was also severely attenuated under anaerobic conditions. Lovastatin treatment enhanced the expression of ergosterol biosynthetic genes, ERG2 and ERG3 in wild-type and upc2B\u0394 but not in upc2A\u0394 cells. Similarly, serum-induced expression of ERG2 and ERG3 was completely impaired in upc2A\u0394 cells but was unaffected in upc2B\u0394 cells, whereas serum-induced expression of the sterol transporter gene CgAUS1 was impaired in both upc2A\u0394 and upc2B\u0394 cells. These results suggest that in C.\u00a0glabrata CgUPC2A but not in CgUPC2B is the main transcriptional regulator of the genes responsible for maintaining sterol homeostasis as well as susceptibility to sterol inhibitors.",

The levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein and bone morphogenetic protein-2 mRNA expression were evaluated by RT-PCR. The osteoblastic differentiation was characterized by the ALP activity and Alizarin Red-S staining for calcium deposition. The activity of the osteocalcin gene (OG2) and synthetic osteoblast-specific elements (6\u00d7 OSE) promoter with statins was also measured using a luciferase assay. For the signal mechanism of statins, the ERK1/2 MAPK activity was determined by western blot analysis.",

Lovastatin or simvastatin at 0.1 \u03bcM increased the levels of ALP, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein and bone morphogenetic protein-2 mRNA in mouse periodontal ligament cells. In addition, the ALP activity, mineralized nodule formation and OG2 and OSE promoter activity were higher in the lovastatin- or simvastatin-treated cells than the control cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that the statins stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2.",

The unexpected finding that these cholesterol-lowering drugs (or 'statins') also possess pleiotropic immunomodulatory properties, has opened a new area of research which investigates the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative properties of statins. In this brief commentary, we discuss the potential application of these drugs in asthma, where metabolic pathways pertinent to lung inflammation, in addition to the mevalonate cascade, may be targeted. We review mechanisms of action, discuss the potential therapeutic use of statins in asthma, share some preliminary data from our laboratory, discuss results from recent clinical trials in asthma, and propose a new target asthma subpopulation that could potentially benefit. We conclude our essay by highlighting the mevalonate-dependent and -independent pathways that may be modulated by statins, including the emerging area of cholesterol, sphingolipid, and lipid raft biology in lung disease. In this is an opportunity to develop new treatments for asthma, where innovative therapies are urgently needed to prevent acute exacerbations and alter disease progression.",

Cardiovascular risk factors that contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) have been shown to negatively impact EPCs, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) which negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level have been shown to impact endothelial cell (EC) angiogenic actions, but little is known about their role in modulating EPC function. In this study we first investigated if EPCs expressed EC specific, angiogenesis-related miRNAs; then determined whether the expression of these miRNAs was altered in EPCs from CAD patients as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, we examined if atorvastatin, known to increase circulating EPC numbers, had any effect on EPC miRNA expression. We found EPCs produced miR-126, miR-130a, miR-221, miR-222 and miR-92a which have thus far been identified as the most important angiogenic miRNAs. Dysregulation of these miRNAs was detected in EPCs from CAD patients and atorvastatin treatment selectively impacted miRNA expression in EPCs. Our data provide evidence that angiogenic miRNAs might play an important role in the control of EPC function, and that their dysregulation might contribute to EPC dysfunction in patients suffering from coronary artery disease. These findings might lead to the development of novel therapeutic modalities for the prevention and treatment of CAD.",

We assessed statin initiation (prescription within 6 months of MI) and continued therapy (% covered by a prescription on a given day of those prescribed a statin within 6 months). The influences of co-morbidities and socio-economic deprivation (Index of Multiple Deprivation) were examined. Statin initiation increased from 37% for MIs in 1997 to 92% in 2006. Continuation at 1 year remained stable over successive cohorts at approximately 80%, settling to about 76% in patients with 5-10 years follow up. Younger age, affluence, revascularisation in 6 months after MI, and absence of congestive heart failure, predicted higher initiation and continuation; a diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes predicted higher initiation, while smoking was associated with poorer continuation. Men had higher initiation and continued therapy, but these effects were largely explained by their younger age. Type of statin initially prescribed did not influence continued usage.", 
    "171": "Statin use after MI increased markedly between 1997 and 2006, whilst continued therapy remained high and stable. Importantly, first choice of statin had no effect on continuation. Whilst the high current levels of initiation may have reached a ceiling, increasing continuation rates among smokers, older patients and those from lower socio-economic groups, should remain a priority.",

All patients underwent glucose loading (75 g oral glucose after 12 hours of fasting) at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. Blood samples were obtained at baseline before glucose loading and 3 hours after loading to determine serum concentrations of cholesterol, lipoproteins, triglycerides, glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin. EDD was evaluated at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 hours after loading. The investigators were blinded to the treatment group assignments, and all analyses were performed in a blinded manner. Adverse events (eg, gastrointestinal disorders, myopathy, liver disorders) were monitored based on reported symptoms or signs (eg, myalgias, muscle cramps), clinical examination, and laboratory parameters (eg, increased liver and muscle enzymes).",

Metformin alone or in combination with atorvastatin was associated with a significant reduction in resting glucose concentrations after 6 weeks (both, P < 0.05 vs baseline), but only the combination of metformin + atorvastatin partly prevented the glucose-induced elevation of serum glucose at 1 hour after loading and the glucose-induced decrease in EDD (both, P < 0.01 vs baseline).",

    "185": "In registry data, among patients who have survived an occlusive stroke, only about half are treated with statins despite a large and persuasive totality of evidence, which includes large-scale randomized trials. In a comprehensive worldwide meta-analysis of 90,056 participants, statins conferred statistically significant and clinically important reductions in stroke and myocardial infarction, as well as cardiovascular and total mortality. In the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial of patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, high-potency statins decreased risks of recurrent stroke and major cardiovascular events. In a nonrandomized subgroup analysis, patients who achieved a 50% or greater reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared to those who achieved <50% had a statistically significant 31% reduction in risk of stroke. Finally, in a comprehensive, worldwide meta-analysis of all trials of cardiovascular disease, patients treated with intensive compared with conventional statin therapy had significantly reduced risks of stroke and myocardial infarction as well as any cardiovascular event or death. Based on this totality of evidence the US federal guidelines as well as those of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association have been revised to recommend that patients with a prior occlusive stroke should have an optional goal for LDL of 70 mg/dL. All these considerations pose important and timely clinical and public health challenges concerning the need for wider utilization of statins in the treatment of patients with stroke.", 
    "186": "Managing dyslipidaemia is central to the management of cardiovascular disease. Most statins can reduce the 5-year incidence of major vascular events by 20%. In Europe, however, up to 53% of statin-treated patients fail to attain their low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) target and residual risk remains high, even when targets are reached. Reasons for this include under-treatment due to insufficient starting doses/failure to uptitrate; poor persistence with therapy due to adverse events (AEs) or drug-drug interactions (DDIs); and failure to treat non-LDL-C risk factors, such as high triglycerides (TGs) and low high-density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C). Phase III and IV studies demonstrate that pitavastatin 1-4 mg has a similar or greater lipid-lowering efficacy to atorvastatin 10-20 mg, simvastatin 20-40 mg and pravastatin 10-40 mg, and is well-tolerated with a low incidence of adverse events (AEs). The SmPC recommends a usual starting dose of 1 mg, with dose-escalation if required. However, since the lower doses (1-2 mg) bring the majority of people with hypercholesterolaemia or combined dyslipidaemia to LDL-C target, the need for pitavastatin uptitration and the risk of under-treatment is low. In addition to reducing LDL-C, pitavastatin has a sustained beneficial effect on other atherogenic lipids, including TGs and HDL-C. Recent studies reveal that pitavastatin reduces coronary atheroma plaque volume as efficiently as atorvastatin and can improve the composition of coronary plaques, effects that are likely to reduce the risk of CV endpoints in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, pitavastatin has a number of pleiotropic effects that can reduce inflammation and lipid oxidation, improve endothelial function, reduce the metabolic changes associated with adiposity, and improve glucose metabolism and renal function. Compared to other statins, pitavastatin has a unique metabolic profile that could reduce the risk of DDIs, thereby providing a clear benefit in patients receiving polypharmacy. Overall, pitavastatin is a well tolerated and effective treatment for patients with hypercholesterolaemia and combined dyslipidaemia, especially in those with low HDL-C, and it should help improve LDL-C-target attainment rates by reducing the risk of under-treatment, minimising AE rates, and reducing the risk of DDIs in people requiring polypharmacy. Future and ongoing studies will directly compare the effects of pitavastatin vs. other statins on hard clinical endpoints.", 
    "187": "The pitavastatin Phase III and IV studies assessed the efficacy and safety of standard dose pitavastatin vs. comparable doses of alternative statins in a broad range of patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Phase III studies conducted in Europe included five 12-week, randomised, double-blind trials evaluating the non-inferiority of pitavastatin 1-4mg vs. atorvastatin 10-20mg, simvastatin 20-40 mg and/or pravastatin 10-40mg in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia and combined dyslipidaemia, including patients with high cardiovascular risk, type II diabetes, and age \u226565 years. The primary endpoint was the adjusted mean percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C); secondary endpoints included changes from baseline in lipid and lipoprotein profiles, LDL-C-target attainment rates and safety parameters. For each study, treatment was continued in open-label, long-term extension studies. Phase IV Japanese studies included CHIBA - a 12-week, open-label active control, non-inferiority investigator-led trial comparing the efficacy and safety of pitavastatin 2mg and atorvastatin 10 mg in patients with hypercholesterolaemia; PIAT - a 52-week open-label, investigator-led, randomised, parallel-group study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of pitavastatin 2mg and atorvastatin 10 mg in patients with hypercholesterolaemia and glucose intolerance; and LIVES - a 2-year prospective post-marketing surveillance of pitavastatin in 20,279 patients with hypercholesterolaemia. The primary endpoint for the first two studies was the percent change from baseline in non-high-density lipoprotein-C (non-HDL-C) and HDL-C, respectively; secondary endpoints included % changes from baseline in other lipid/lipoprotein parameters, safety and tolerability. Overall, Phase III and IV studies demonstrate that pitavastatin 1-4mg is well tolerated, improves atherogenic lipid profile and increases LDL-C target attainment rates with a similar or greater efficacy to comparable doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin in most patient groups. In each of these studies, improvements in lipid profile were sustained or improved during the long term suggesting benefits for continued treatment with pitavastatin.", 
    "188": "Pitavastatin has been designed as a synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor with a novel cyclopropyl moiety that results in several differences compared to other statins. These include effective inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and increased lipoprotein lipase expression at lower doses than other statins, and significant high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1-elevating activity that persists with time. The safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin and its major metabolite, pitavastatin lactone, have been investigated in a variety of patient groups with similar results, which suggests dosage adjustments are not required for gender, age or race. In healthy subjects, pitavastatin is well tolerated at the approved doses with no serious adverse events. The bioavailability of pitavastatin is, at 60%, higher than that of any other statin and the majority of the bioavailable fraction of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the bile. The entero-hepatic circulation of unchanged drug contributes to the prolonged duration of action and allows once-daily, any-time dosing. Pitavastatin is only slightly metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and not at all by CYP3A4. Neither pitavastatin nor its lactone form, have inhibitory effects on CYP, and CYP3A4 inhibitors have no effect on pitavastatin concentrations. Moreover, P-glycoprotein-mediated transport does not play a major role in the drug's disposition and pitavastatin does not inhibit P-glycoprotein activity. Pitavastatin is transported into the liver by several hepatic transporters but OATP1B1 inhibitors have relatively little effect on plasma concentrations compared with other statins. In general, interactions, except with multi-transporter inhibitors like ciclosporin, are not clinically significant. Consequently, pitavastatin has minimal drug-food and drug-drug interactions making it a treatment option in the large group of dyslipidaemic people that require multidrug therapy.", 
    "189": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for \u223c30% of mortality, worldwide. Of the nine common risk factors for CVDs, the multinational INTERHEART study showed that dyslipidaemia, defined as an elevated apolipoprotein (apo) B:apoA1 ratio, is one of the most significant. The effective management of dyslipidaemia is therefore essential for the reduction of CV risk. It is well established that lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels using statins significantly reduces the level of CV risk in people with dyslipidaemia. A meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials, for example, demonstrated that each mmol/L reduction in LDL-C was associated with a 12% reduction in all-cause mortality, a 19% reduction in coronary mortality, and a 21% reduction in the total risk of major vascular events. Based on the results from this and similar studies, international treatment guidelines recommend lowering LDL-C to <2.0-2.6 mmol/L (<77-100 mg/dL) in patients with established CVDs and to <1.8-2.0 mmol/L (<70-77 mg/dL), where possible. Among the seven commonly used statins, pitavastatin is frequently used in Japan, South Korea, Thailand and China; it has recently been licensed for use in the USA and is now in the final stages of national approval within Europe. The following reviews discuss the safety and efficacy of pitavastatin for the treatment of dyslipidaemia relative to atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, and examine its additional benefits beyond LDL-C reduction and its potential role in clinical practice.", 
    "190": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss, inability to perform the activities of daily living and personality changes. Unfortunately, drugs effective for this disease are limited to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that do not impact disease pathogenesis. Statins, which belong to the class of cholesterol-reducing drugs, were proposed as novel agents useful in AD therapy, but the mechanism underlying their neuroprotective effect is still unknown. In this study, we show that atorvastatin may have antioxidant effects, in aged beagles, that represent a natural higher mammalian model of AD. Atorvastatin (80 mg/day for 14.5 months) significantly reduced lipoperoxidation, protein oxidation and nitration, and increased GSH levels in parietal cortex of aged beagles. This effect was specific for brain because it was not paralleled by a concomitant reduction in all these parameters in serum. In addition, atorvastatin slightly reduced the formation of cholesterol oxidation products in cortex but increased the 7-ketocholesterol/total cholesterol ratio in serum. We also found that increased oxidative damage in the parietal cortex was associated with poorer learning (visual discrimination task). Thus, a novel pharmacological effect of atorvastatin mediated by reducing oxidative damage may be one mechanism underlying benefits of this drug in AD.",

    "212": "Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia, comprised mainly of hypertriglyceridemia, and low HDL-C, with either statin or fibrate monotherapy, is moderately effective at reversing the abnormal lipid levels, but does not completely reverse the risk of CVD. Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate more effectively treats diabetic dyslipidemia; however, neither the impact on CVD risk nor the safety profile of statin-fibrate combined treatment had been tested in a large randomized trial. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD)-Lipid trial tested the hypothesis that combination therapy with a fibrate and statin would more effectively prevent major CVD events in a high-risk population of patients with T2DM compared with statin monotherapy. In ACCORD-Lipid, over 5000 patients were treated with fenofibrate plus simvastatin versus simvastatin alone. Although combination therapy did not significantly reduce CVD event rates in the ACCORD-Lipid cohort as a whole, a predefined subgroup of participants with the combination of significant hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C experienced a 31% lower event rate with combination therapy. Post hoc analyses conducted in similar subsets in previous fibrate monotherapy trials were concordant with these findings in ACCORD-Lipid. Combination therapy was well tolerated and safe, with no detectable increase in myopathy. The implications of the ACCORD-Lipid findings for the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with T2DM are discussed.",

    "214": "This was a retrospective study from 12/07 to 12/09, conducted at a private, community hospital. Inclusion criteria required patients to have an acute myocaridal infarction (AMI) ICD-9 code, troponin \u22650.2 ng/dL and lipid panel performed within 96 hours of troponin. Patients with a triglyceride level > 400 mg/dL were excluded. The residual risk population consisted of patients currently taking a statin with LDL <100 mg/dL and HDL <50/55 mg/dL. Patients were excluded from the residual risk population if they were on niacin, had an allergy to or previously failed niacin therapy, or expired within 72 hours.",

The majority of patients (n=521, 94.2%) had an HDL < 50 or 55 mg/dL respective of gender. Ninety-two (80.0%) residual risk patients had no change in their home lipid medications post AMI. Fifteen (13.0%) residual risk patients had their dose of statin medication increased. Seven (6.1%) residual risk patients were initiated on niacin.",

The results also confirm a low incidence of medication intervention in the residual risk population post AMI (20.0%) regarding lipid therapy, including the initiation of niacin in only 6.1% of patients.", 
    "217": "New guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend the consideration of statin therapy as a first-line pharmacological measure in children as young as 8 years old with marked hypercholesterolemia. Thus, it is important to review both the safety and efficacy of initiating statin therapy prior to adulthood. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis, thereby lowering serum cholesterol levels. However, there are special considerations that need to be made when initiating medications such as statins in the pediatric population. Cholesterol is crucial for various biologic processes including neurological development. Cholesterol also serves as a biochemical precursor to many hormones including those critical in sexual development. This article examines the current evidence for the safety and efficacy of statin use in the pediatric population and identifies areas for future research.",

Stabilizing the vulnerable plaque is a key strategy in treating these high risk patients. Statins in high doses have proved their utility and safety in secondary prevention trials. Early initiations of statins are beneficial by way of their pleiotropic effects in stabilizing the vulnerable plaque and thus reducing coronary events and death.", 
    "224": "Statin therapy reduces coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality in individuals with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol below the threshold at which statin therapy is recommended. We determined the proportion of individuals with elevated CRP in whom statin therapy was not indicated, and examined predictors for elevated CRP in a multi-ethnic Asian population.",

Eligibility for statin therapy was determined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII)) guideline. CRP was measured by high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. CRP level greater than 2\u2009mg\u2009l(-1) was considered as elevated.", 
    "226": "Elevated CRP was found in 29.3% participants who were not eligible for statin therapy (n=2974). Elevated CRP was more common in females and amongst those of Malay or Asian-Indian ethnicity. Compared with participants with low CRP, those with elevated CRP were shown to have higher levels of obesity, blood pressure, triglyceride and insulin resistance (IR), but lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (all Ps<0.001). After multivariate analysis, gender (odds ratio (OR) 3.34 for females), ethnicity (Malay OR 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25-1.96; Asian-Indian OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.55-2.50), waist circumference (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.05-1.07), smoking (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08-2.05) and IR (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07-1.22) were significant predictors of CRP (all Ps--values<0.05).",
