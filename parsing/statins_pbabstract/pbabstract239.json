An overview of the medical literature on statin use and cardiac outcome was also performed.

    "5": "NORK in legumes encodes a receptor-like kinase that is required for Nod factor signaling and root nodule development. Using Medicago truncatula NORK as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase 1 (Mt HMGR1) as a NORK interacting partner. HMGR1 belongs to a multigene family in M. truncatula, and different HMGR isoforms are key enzymes in the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of a diverse array of isoprenoid compounds. Testing other HMGR members revealed a specific interaction between NORK and HMGR1. Mutagenesis and deletion analysis showed that this interaction requires the cytosolic active kinase domain of NORK and the cytosolic catalytic domain of HMGR1. NORK homologs from Lotus japonicus and Sesbania rostrata also interacted with Mt HMGR1, but homologous nonsymbiotic kinases of M. truncatula did not. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGR activities decreased nodule number and delayed nodulation, supporting the importance of the mevalonate pathway in symbiotic development. Decreasing HMGR1 expression in M. truncatula transgenic roots by RNA interference led to a dramatic decrease in nodulation, confirming that HMGR1 is essential for nodule development. Recruitment of HMGR1 by NORK could be required for production of specific isoprenoid compounds, such as cytokinins, phytosteroids, or isoprenoid moieties involved in modification of signaling proteins.", 
    "6": "Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major source of morbidity and mortality in the United States, a relatively small percentage of deaths related to CVD result from ischemic stroke. However, the impairment and costs associated with stroke are large--and largely preventable. Large-scale trials have demonstrated benefit with antihypertensive therapy for secondary prevention, showing significantly reduced rates of stroke and cardiovascular events. Statins have shown efficacy in primary stroke prevention, and one trial showed reduced incidence of stroke and cardiovascular events in patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The merits of antiplatelet therapy in primary and secondary stroke prevention have been demonstrated across numerous trials and meta-analyses. Trials assessing aspirin plus clopidogrel or aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole for preventing secondary stroke have produced somewhat contradictory findings. This review discusses the relationship between CVD and risk of secondary stroke or TIA and summarizes secondary prevention strategies, focusing on antiplatelet agents, to provide guidance for the practicing cardiologist. Certain combination therapies appear to be more effective for secondary prevention of stroke or TIA than therapy with single antiplatelet agents. The choice of agents may be important, based on results of several trials. The ongoing, large-scale, comparative Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes (PR. FESS) trial should provide cardiologists with more definitive recommendations.", 
    "7": "4-Sulfamoyl pyrroles were designed as novel hepatoselective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) to reduce myalgia, a statin-induced adverse effect. The compounds were prepared via a [3+2] cycloaddition of a M\u00fcnchnone with a sulfonamide-substituted alkyne. We identified compounds with greater selectivity for hepatocytes compared to L6-myocytes than rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. There was an inverse correlation of myocyte potencies and ClogP values. A number of analogs were effective at reducing cholesterol in acute and chronic in vivo models but they lacked sufficient chronic in vivo activity to warrant further development.", 
    "8": "Myositis is an infrequent side effect of statin therapy, usually presenting as diffuse myositis with muscle weakness and cramping involving multiple body parts. We report a case of focal myositis of a hip muscle diagnosed on magnetic resonance imaging, as the underlying pathology was suspected to be related to an orthopaedic disease due to isolated hip symptoms, and which was finally attributed to statin intake. Awareness to this rare cause of musculoskeletal symptoms is indicated in case a patient presents with probable orthopaedic disease and is on statin therapy.", 
    "9": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, exert various beneficial effects independent of serum cholesterol reduction; among others is antioxidative action. Human promyelocytic cells (HL-60) were used to examine the effect of the statin rosuvastatin on reactive oxygen species-induced DNA damage, formation of oxidative stress and expression of glutathione metabolising enzymes. Rosuvastatin from 10nM significantly reduced DNA damage induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or by hydrogen peroxide, as assessed by the comet assay. PMA-provoked formation of reactive oxygen species, measured by flow cytometric measurement, was also prevented by rosuvastatin. Pre-incubation of cells with rosuvastatin revealed a protective effect of the statin even after its removal from the incubation medium. Total glutathione in cells treated with PMA, with and without co-incubation with rosuvastatin, was increased significantly in cells incubated with rosuvastatin alone. The quantification of the mRNA and activity of glutathione synthesizing enzymes by PCR showed a significant upregulation of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. In conclusion, rosuvastatin exerts antioxidative effects, which are also capable of preventing DNA damage. These effects seem to be independent of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition and involve the induction of the expression of antioxidant defense enzymes.", 
    "10": "Thiazolidinediones are ligands of PPAR-gamma, a member of the nuclear receptor family. These drugs have shown promising pre-clinical activity in tumor models but clinical studies failed to confirm their beneficial effect. We have studied the in vitro antitumor effects of a combination of ciglitazone, a thiazolidinedione drug, and lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. We observed a marked synergism in several different tumor cell lines resulting from both inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. These results strongly suggest that combining PPAR-gamma agonists with statins can produce significant antitumor effects.", 
    "11": "There is an increasing burden of occlusive cardiovascular disease (CVD) in developed, as well as in developing, countries. In fact, the WHO has projected that CVD will become the leading cause of death in the world in the next 10 years. The proximate cause of virtually all occlusive vascular events is thrombosis and the principal underlying cause is atherosclerosis. Aspirin, which inhibits platelet-dependent cyclooxygenase for the entire life of the platelet, has clinically important antithrombotic effects. Statins, which principally decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have clinically important antiatherogenic effects. In secondary prevention, in a wide range of patients who have survived a prior myocardial infarction (MI), occlusive stroke, transient ischemic attack, as well as other high-risk conditions, long-term use of aspirin confers statistically significant and clinically important reductions in MI, stroke and CVD death. In addition, aspirin confers similar benefits when administered during acute MI or acute occlusive stroke. In primary prevention, aspirin confers a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in risk of a first MI but the data on stroke and CVD death remain inconclusive, so aspirin should be prescribed on an individual basis by the healthcare provider who weighs this clear benefit against long-term side effects. In a meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials of 90,056 subjects treated for 5 years, statins confer statistically significant and clinically important reductions in MI, stroke, CVD death and total mortality. In a meta-analysis of randomized trials of statins, in which aspirin was used in varying frequencies, the combination of aspirin and statins conferred greater clinical benefits than either agent alone on MI, occlusive stroke and CVD death. At present, the wider and more appropriate use of aspirin and statins will reduce premature MI, stroke and CVD death.", 
    "12": "Ezetimibe is a drug that impairs intestinal cholesterol absorption and decreases blood cholesterol levels. It has been shown that added to statins it can achieve a further reduction of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol of 18-20%, overcoming the increase in absorption that follow the reduction in cholesterol synthesis by statins. Four major outcome trials are underway to study the effect of ezetimibe plus simvastatin in different subsets of high-risk patients: familiar hypercholesterolemia, degenerative aortic stenosis, chronic kidney disease and acute coronary syndrome. Hopefully, in the next few years the information provided by these trials will allow us to further reduce the increasing burden of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "13": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects 1.5-2.0% of the population in the developed world. Projected data from population-based studies in the US indicate that the number of adults with AF will swell by 2.5-3.0-fold by 2050. Despite advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies for rhythm or rate control in patients with AF, primary prevention with 'upstream' therapy and risk factor modification is likely to produce a far greater effect in the general population than specific interventions. Rapidly developing experimental work has provided new insights into AF pathophysiology that will lead to new mechanism-based therapies. Agents targeting inflammation, oxidative injury, atrial myocyte metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis, have theoretical advantages as novel therapeutic strategies. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, beta-blockers, statins, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown antiarrhythmic potential, over and above any effect related to the treatment of underlying heart disease. These agents could be exploited to prevent or delay atrial remodeling in patients with AF, even in the absence of routine indications for such therapy. This Review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the possible preventive and reverse remodeling roles of statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids in AF.", 
    "14": "Statin-treatment of fructose-fed/insulin resistant hamsters was recently shown to ameliorate metabolic dyslipidemia and hepatic VLDL overproduction. Here, we provide evidence that rosuvastatin treatment of insulin resistant hamsters can induce improvements in hepatic and whole body insulin sensitivity. Treatment with 10 mg/kg/day rosuvastatin for 10 days significantly reduced fasting insulin (-59%) and triglyceride (-50%) levels in fructose-fed hamsters (p<0.05). Following an intraperitoneal (IP) glucose challenge, rosuvastatin-treated hamsters exhibited enhanced glucose clearance compared to untreated hamsters maintained on the high-fructose diet (area under curve (AUC)=1772+/-223 mM min vs. 2413+/-253 mM min, respectively; p<0.002) with a significant reduction in 2h post-challenge glucose (n=5, p<0.02). Rosuvastatin-treatment also significantly improved sensitivity to an IP insulin challenge (AUC=314+/-39 mM min vs. 195+/-22 mM min for rosuvastatin-treated and fructose-fed hamsters, respectively; p<0.04, n=3). At the molecular level, significant increases in tyrosine-phosphorylation of the hepatic insulin receptor and IRS-1 were observed for rosuvastatin-treated hamsters (+37% and +58%, respectively) compared to fructose-fed controls following an intravenous (IV) bolus of insulin (p<0.05). Increases in insulin receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation were also observed in muscle and adipose tissue. Analysis of hepatic Akt phosphorylation and mass revealed a small (25%) increase in serine phosphorylation of Akt with no significant change in Akt mass, although serine-phosphorylation and mass of Akt2 were significantly increased (+32%, p=0.03, and +42%, p=0.01, respectively). Interestingly, expression of PTP-1B, a key negative regulator of insulin signaling, showed a non-significant trend toward reduction in liver and was significantly reduced in adipose tissue (-20% and -37%, respectively). Taken together, these data suggest that statin-treatment increases whole body and peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity via improved cellular insulin signal transduction.", 
    "15": "Cardiovascular diseases, the clinical paradigm of atherosclerosis, are the primary cause of mortality in developed countries. The origin of the atheromatous lesion is multifactorial, as it is the therapeutic approach to its prevention and clinical complications. The initial symptoms of ischemia in a vascular bed are usually evident when the atherosclerotic process is very advanced, being indicative of a diffuse disease and of an elevated future risk for ischemic events in other vascular territories. We perform this review in this clinical scenario, highlighting the preventive and therapeutic aspects of demonstrated clinical efficacy, with no detail of those treatments with benefit insufficiently proven.",

The latter two groups underwent UUO and then received vehicle only or atorvastatin (10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) by daily gastric gavage, from three days before the UUO operation to the day of sacrifice . The sham operation rats received vehicle. Five rats of each group were sacrificed respectively at 5, 10 and 15 days after surgery. Histological changes in renal tissue were observed by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson stain. Immunohistochemistry for PPAR gamma was performed in renal interstitium at each time point.", 
    "18": "Interstitial expansion and fibrosis in ureter obstructed kidney was prominent in the model group. Atorvastatin seemed to have ameliorated interstitial expansion and fibrosis in atorvastatin group. Detectable basic PPAR gamma expression was observed in renal inner medulla of rats in sham operation group, and it was mainly concentrated in collecting tubules. In UUO rats, PPAR gamma expression was found increased and extended to renal tubular epithelial cells. Increased PPAR gamma expression was found on the 5th day after UUO, and significant PPAR gamma expression was found on the 10 th day after UUO. The increased PPAR gamma expression was found to be downregulated on the 15 th day after UUO, but still significantly increased compared with that of the model group at the same time point (all P<0.01). Atorvastatin could significantly increase the expression of PPAR gamma as compared with the model group at each time point (all P<0.01).",

    "20": "High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) transports in plasma, phospholipids, cholesterol, and triacylglycerol. The cholesterol associated with HDL (HDLc) is cholesterol that is scavenged from peripheral tissues back to liver. The liver converts this cholesterol into bile acids, bile salts, and esterifies the rest and secretes them into bile. Low HDLc is a risk factor for atherogenesis. Higher levels of HDLc in plasma are therefore an index of safety from coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. Regular physical exercise, and changes in life style like cessation of smoking, lowered alcohol consumption, modified dietary fat intake and certain medications can improve the level of HDLc in plasma.", 
    "21": "(1) Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs extensively used in cardiovascular prevention. Their most well-known adverse effect is muscle damage, including rhabdomyolysis. (2) Several cases of peripheral polyneuropathy attributed to a statin have been published or reported by pharmacovigilance centres. (3) They included sensory or sensorimotor polyneuropathy with signs of sensory impairment, and a decrease or sometimes a suppression of osteotendinous reflexes. Some patients also had a marked reduction in muscle strength in the affected limb(s). Renal failure and diabetes appear to increase the risk of this adverse effect. (4) Epidemiological studies and clinical trials have shown that this adverse effect is rare, affecting only about one patient in 10 000 treated for one year. (5) After ruling out other possible causes of peripheral neuropathy, statin withdrawal often leads to clinical improvement.", 
    "22": "Acute discontinuation of statins induces vascular dysfunction and increases cardiovascular events. The mechanisms underlying these events are under investigation. We showed an increase in angiotensin II (AngII) signaling after acute statin withdrawal. We investigated whether AngII-AT1-receptor expression (AT1-R mRNA) and receptor protein (AT1-R) levels mediate increased AngII signaling. In rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), simvastatin (0.3 to 3 microM for 24 hours) resulted in concentration-dependent inhibition of AngII-stimulated phosphorylation of extracellular-signal regulated kinase 1/2 ERK1/2 (-67 +/- 5% with 3 microM; P < 0.001) and decreased AT1-R mRNA (-34 +/- 8% with 3 microM; P < 0.01) and AT1-R protein (-32 +/- 6% with 3 microM; P < 0.01). Removal of simvastatin led to a rebound increase in mRNA-AT1-R (+39 +/- 2%, P < 0.01), AT1-R protein (+46 +/- 2%; P < 0.01), and AngII-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (+36 +/- 3%; P < 0.01). The increase in receptor expression was present at 1 hour and lasted for 4 hours, whereas increased AT1-R protein and AngII signaling started at 2 hours and lasted for nearly 2 hours. In summary, increased AngII signaling after statin withdrawal is most likely due to increases in AT1-R number due to increased transcription. The increase in AngII activity may contribute to the vascular dysfunction associated with statin withdrawal.",

    "26": "Therapeutic doses of zoledronic acid markedly inhibit in vitro proliferation, chemotaxis, and capillarogenesis of bone marrow endothelial cells of patients with multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid also induces a sizeable reduction of angiogenesis in the in vivo chorioallantoic membrane assay. These effects are partly sustained by gene and protein inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 in an autocrine loop. Mevastatin, a specific inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, reverts the zoledronic acid antiangiogenic effect, indicating that the drug halts this pathway. Our results provide evidence of a direct antiangiogenic activity of zoledronic acid on multiple myeloma patient-derived endothelial cells due to at least four different mechanisms identified either in vitro or in vivo. Tentatively, we suggest that the zoledronic acid antitumoral activity in multiple myeloma is also sustained by antiangiogenesis, which would partly account for its therapeutic efficacy in multiple myeloma.", 
    "27": "The proinflammatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is expressed in inflammatory and atherosclerotic lesions. GM-CSF is known to enhance monocytic expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which GM-CSF up-regulates the MCP-1 expression remains to be clarified. Thus, in this study, we examined our hypothesis that GM-CSF up-regulates the MCP-1 expression via Jak2-Stat5 signaling pathway. In human monocytic cell line U937, GM-CSF increased MCP-1 expression in protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, analysis of the GM-CSF promoter element revealed that the STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-5) transcription factor binding site, located between -152 and -144 upstream of the transcription start site, as well as Janus kinase-2-mediated Stat5 activation were necessary for the GM-CSF-induced transcriptional up-regulation of the MCP-1 gene. This GM-CSF-induced MCP-1 expression, measured as both protein and mRNA levels, was down-regulated by atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor. However, this decrease in MCP-1 expression was not at the transcriptional level of MCP-1 gene but rather at the level of the stability of MCP-1 mRNA. These results indicate that GM-CSF regulates MCP-1 expression via Janus kinase-2-Stat5 pathway and by a novel regulatory mechanism of statins to reduce inflammatory reactions by down-regulating the expression of monocytic MCP-1, which promotes atherogenesis.",

Patients were treated with a combination of sirolimus (SRL), cyclosporine (CsA), and various durations of steroids. Statins were prescribed for 259/325 (79%) recipients whose serum cholesterol exceeded 240 mg/dL and discontinued when the creatine phosphokinase increased fivefold (3.4%) or the liver function, threefold (3.0%) above normal.", 
    "30": "Upon univariate (hazard ratio [HR] 0.16; P<.001) and multivariate analysis (HR 0.38; P=.02), statins were markedly protective against acute rejection episodes. They reduced occurrence of chronic nephropathy/chronic rejection (HR 0.60; P=.03 and HR 0.52; P=.01, respectively). Incidences of graft loss were diminished (HR 0.26; P<.001 and HR 0.49; P=.01, respectively). Finally, the mortality rate was decreased (HR 0.21, P=.001 and HR 0.26, P=.01, respectively).

LDL (100 mg/dl) caused a dysfunction of HUVEC manifested by a 60% reduction in NO and an almost twofold increase in ONOO-. Treatment with AML/AT partially reversed the effects of LDL on endothelial function, including a 90% increase in NO and 50% reduction in ONOO-. Small-angle X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that AML and AT are lipophilic and share an overlapping molecular location in the cell membrane that could facilitate electron transfer for antioxidant mechanisms.",

    "53": "Epidemiological studies of statins have suggested a link between statin therapy and a decreased risk of sepsis. It has been proposed that the mechanism underlying this apparent protective effect of statins relates to their known immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to explore the antimicrobial effect of statins.", 
    "54": "Simvastatin (Merck) and fluvastatin (Novartis) were both tested against six of each of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA + MRSA), and vancomycin-sensitive and -resistant enterococci (VSE + VRE) using a microtitre dilution method. The test was repeated five times for both statins against all 24 isolates. Vancomycin, linezolid and propranolol were used as controls, as appropriate.", 
    "55": "Simvastatin showed a significant antimicrobial effect against MSSA (mean MIC 29.2 mg/L) and to a lesser extent against MRSA (mean MIC 74.9 mg/L). Fluvastatin had a significantly less marked antimicrobial effect. Propranolol showed no antimicrobial effect. Simvastatin has a considerable antimicrobial effect in vitro and further testing of it is warranted.", 
    "56": "The utility of peri-operative statin therapy is currently considered to be inconclusive. To provide a platform for more meaningful peri-operative statin literature in the future, this is the first of two review articles evaluating peri-operative statin therapy. This review examines the predictors of cardiovascular outcome and therapeutic targets which are established in medical (non-surgical) patients. In patients with stable coronary artery disease at least 4-6 weeks of standard statin therapy are required to realise most of the beneficial cellular and metabolic effects of statin therapy. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol reduction is associated with improved survival in these patients. In comparison, patients who sustain an acute coronary event require high-dose statin therapy probably initiated within 24 h with a therapeutic target of C-reactive protein reduction. Withdrawal of statin therapy results in a rapid return to endothelial dysfunction and amplification of the inflammatory process, which may increase cardiovascular risk.", 
    "57": "The capacity of FasL molecules expressed on melanoma cells to induce lymphocyte apoptosis contributes to either antitumor immune response or escape depending on their expression level. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms regulating FasL protein expression. Using the murine B16F10 melanoma model weakly positive for FasL, we demonstrated that in vitro treatment with statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl CoA reductase, enhances membrane FasL expression. C3 exotoxin and the geranylgeranyl transferase I inhibitor GGTI-298, but not the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277, mimic this effect. The capacity of GGTI-298 and C3 exotoxin to inhibit RhoA activity prompted us to investigate the implication of RhoA in FasL expression. Inhibition of RhoA expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased membrane FasL expression, whereas overexpression of constitutively active RhoA following transfection of RhoAV14 plasmid decreased it. Moreover, the inhibition of a RhoA downstream effector p160ROCK also induced this FasL overexpression. We conclude that the RhoA/ROCK pathway negatively regulates membrane FasL expression in these melanoma cells. Furthermore, we have shown that B16F10 cells, through the RhoA/ROCK pathway, promote in vitro apoptosis of Fas-sensitive A20 lymphoma cells. Our results suggest that RhoA/ROCK inhibition could be an interesting target to control FasL expression and lymphocyte apoptosis induced by melanoma cells.", 
    "58": "No consensus has been reached whether clinical use of statins has beneficial effects on bone health, partly due to lower statin concentrations because of first-pass metabolism by the liver. We thus evaluated the effects of pitavastatin, which does not undergo first-pass metabolism, on bone metabolism.", 
    "59": "According to the therapeutic regimen, the subjects were divided into two groups (group A, 66 with pitavastatin; group B, 35 without pitavastatin). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and serum N-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) as bone turnover markers (BTMs) were compared between the two groups and between at baseline and after 3 months of treatment in each group. Correlations between baseline characteristics and deltaBTMs, and between delta lipid profile and deltaBTMs were investigated using both Pearson's correlation analysis and multivariate analysis.", 
    "60": "The subjects were 101 patients with untreated hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "61": "After 3 months of treatment, BAP in group A did not change significantly compared with either the baseline value or that in group B. However, NTx in group A significantly decreased compared with both the baseline value and that in group B. In addition, deltaNTx was negatively correlated with NTx at baseline, and the significance of this correlation persisted after multiple regression analysis.", 
    "62": "Our findings suggest that pitavastatin may have potentially beneficial effects on bone metabolism primarily by reducing bone resorption rather than by stimulating bone formation. Further studies with more patients and longer duration are warranted to evaluate its effects, if any, on prevention of osteoporosis and subsequent fractures.", 
    "63": "Inhibitors of isoprenoid synthesis are widely used for treatment of human diseases, including hypercholesterolemia and osteoporosis, and they have the potential to be useful for treatment of cancer. Statin drugs inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, whereas nitrogenous bisphosphonates have more recently been shown to inhibit farnesyl disphosphate synthase. In addition, our laboratory has recently developed several potent and specific bisphosphonate inhibitors of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, including digeranyl bisphosphonate. Because all three enzymes fall in the same biosynthetic pathway and many of the biological effects are due to depletion of downstream products, we hypothesized that simultaneous inhibition of these enzymes would result in synergistic growth inhibition. In this study, we show that inhibition of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase induces apoptosis in K562 leukemia cells. This induction of apoptosis is in part dependent upon both geranylgeranyl diphosphate depletion and accumulation of farnesyl diphosphate. Combinations of either lovastatin or zoledronate with digeranyl bisphosphonate synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis. These combinations also potently inhibited cellular geranylgeranylation. These results support the potential for combinations of multiple inhibitors of isoprene biosynthesis to inhibit cancer cell growth or metastasis at clinically achievable concentrations.", 
    "64": "RhoA, a small GTPase protein, and its immediate downstream target, Rho kinase (ROCK), control a wide variety of signal transduction pathways. Recent studies have shown that fasudil, a selective ROCK inhibitor, may play a pivotal role in a number of pathological conditions, ranging from cardiovascular diseases to pulmonary hypertension and erectile dysfunction. Considerable evidence suggests that some of the beneficial effects of statins may also stem from their modulatory effects on RhoA/ROCK signaling. In the current study, we hypothesized that pharmacological blockade of the RhoA/ROCK pathway with either fasudil or simvastatin would ameliorate progression of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "65": "In two separate experiments, diabetic db/db mice received fasudil (10 mg x kg(-) x day(-) i.p.) or simvastatin (40 mg x kg(-) x day(-) p.o.) for 16 weeks. Untreated db/db and db/m mice served as controls.", 
    "66": "The kidney cortices of untreated db/db mice displayed increased ROCK activity compared with db/m mice. The fasudil-treated mice exhibited a significant reduction in ROCK activity, albuminuria, glomerular collagen IV accumulation, and urinary collagen IV excretion compared with untreated db/db mice. Interestingly, blood glucose was unaffected by fasudil administration. Treatment with simvastatin significantly attenuated RhoA activation in the kidney cortices of db/db mice and resulted in a significant reduction of albuminuria and mesangial matrix expansion.", 
    "67": "Based on these results, we propose that RhoA/ROCK blockade constitutes a novel approach to the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Our data also suggest a critical role for RhoA/ROCK activation in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "68": "Statins belong to a class of drugs known to inhibit 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and block hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Since the initial statin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987, these agents quickly became the gold standard for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Effective lipid-lowering has been found to improve the long-term prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. In addition, statins have also been found to be highly effective in primary and secondary stroke prevention among medically managed patients with cardiovascular disease, and it appears that this benefit is largely due to the non-cholesterol-lowering, so-called pleiotropic, effects of statins. During the past decade, agents such as beta-blockers, aspirin, or other antiplatelet medications have proven to reduce the incidence of adverse postoperative outcomes among vascular surgical patients, and have rightfully assumed a place in our overall therapeutic armamentarium. There is growing evidence that statins may be especially effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and improving outcomes after major vascular surgery. A recent study from Johns Hopkins Hospital demonstrated a threefold reduction in the rate of perioperative stroke (P < .05) and fivefold reduction of perioperative mortality (P < .05) among 1,566 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This benefit was confirmed in a series of 3,360 CEAs performed at multiple hospitals throughout Western Canada. Statin use was independently associated with a 75% reduction (odds ratio [OR] = 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.90) in the odds of death and 45% reduction (OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.32-0.95) in the odds of ischemic stroke or death among patients with symptomatic carotid disease. Further, there is some data indicating that statin use may reduce long-term incidence of restenosis following CEA. Preliminary work indicates that a similar benefit of statin use in reducing neurologic morbidity among patients undergoing carotid angioplasty and stent procedures. A number of the pleiotropic effects of statin medications may be responsible for these clinical observations. Further work is necessary to better elucidate these mechanisms, as well as to determine the optimal agents, dosing, and timing of drug administration among patients undergoing carotid interventions.", 
    "69": "Statins and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are 2 classes of drugs prescribed frequently in clinical practice that may have pleiotropic effects in addition to cholesterol-lowering and blood pressure-lowering effects, respectively. Combined treatment with statins and RAS inhibitors may have additional benefits beyond each monotherapy. We assessed the usefulness of the combined treatment in the Japanese Coronary Artery Disease (JCAD) Study population. In the JCAD Study, 13,812 patients with angiographically shown narrowing in > or =1 of 3 major coronary arteries were followed up for a mean of 2.7 years. The primary end point of the study was all cardiovascular events. In the present study, baseline covariates possibly influencing the event rate were adjusted between the control and treatment groups. Although there were no statistically significant differences in event rates between patients receiving neither statins nor RAS inhibitors and those receiving either drug, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a 22% decrease (p = 0.0286) in the event rate with combined treatment. In conclusion, statins combined with RAS inhibitors may decrease cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease.",

    "86": "Apoptosis plays an important role in pathogenesis of primary and secondary cardiomyopathies. It is proposed that antiapoptotic interventions may constitute an effective strategy for these diseases. Some of the antiapoptotic interventions are \"old wine in a new bottle\" measures already included in the conventional pharmacotherapy. As specific antiapoptotic treatment, caspase inhibitors and anti-TNF-alpha antibody are in early phases of clinical trials in non-cardiac diseases or being contemplated for clinical studies. Non-pharmacotherapies such as cardiac resynchronization and left ventricular assist device also exert cardioprotection partly by antiapoptotic mechanisms. In the field of regenerative medicine, myocardial transplantation of bone marrow-derived stem cells has been performed. Although it is controversial whether it is a true regenerative medicine or the cytokine therapy, antiapoptotic effect of transplanted cells may also have a role in cardioprotection. Moreover, apoptosis may develop despite efforts for cardioprotection in some severe situations of heart failure. Cardiac repair and regeneration by cardiac stem cells may compensate a loss of cardiomyocytes avoiding a deleterious situation. Therefore, protection and/or potentiation of such effects by cardiac stem cells appear to be promising therapeutic strategy in the future. In this review, we discuss about the antiapoptotic interventions for cardiomyopathies in the \"real world\" and the future of clinical cardiology.", 
    "87": "Clinical and experimental observations suggest that statins may be useful for treating diseases presenting with predominant neurogenic inflammation, but the mechanism(s) mediating this potential therapeutic effect are poorly understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that statins act directly on sensory neurons to decrease expression of proinflammatory neuropeptides that trigger neurogenic inflammation, specifically calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, radioimmunoassay, and immunocytochemistry were used to quantify CGRP and substance P expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) harvested from adult male rats and in primary cultures of sensory neurons derived from embryonic rat DRG. Systemic administration of statins at pharmacologically relevant doses significantly reduced CGRP and substance P levels in DRG in vivo. In cultured sensory neurons, statins blocked bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-induced CGRP and substance P expression and decreased expression of these neuropeptides in sensory neurons pretreated with BMPs. These effects were concentration-dependent and occurred independent of effects on cell survival or axon growth. Statin inhibition of neuropeptide expression was reversed by supplementation with mevalonate and cholesterol, but not isoprenoid precursors. BMPs signal via Smad activation, and cholesterol depletion by statins inhibited Smad1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. These findings identify a novel action of statins involving down-regulation of proinflammatory neuropeptide expression in sensory ganglia via cholesterol depletion and decreased Smad1 activation and suggest that statins may be effective in attenuating neurogenic inflammation.", 
    "88": "In the Calcium Acetate Renagel Evaluation (CARE)-2 study, the effects of calcium acetate plus atorvastatin (Lipitor) on the progression of coronary artery calcifications (CACs) are evaluated versus those of Renagel, monitored using dual electron beam tomography (EBT) scans (two scans at study initiation and two at follow up). The aim of this study is to estimate the interscan variation for the Agatston score and for the volume score determined in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the CARE-2 study.", 
    "89": "CAC score and volume were measured at study initiation in 463 ESRD subjects (mean age: 59.4 +/- 12.5 years, 48.3% female). All patients underwent dual scanning using an EBT, as first scan of two needed to measure the progression of CAC when treated with sevelamer (Renagel) compared with calcium acetate with or without atorvastatin. All scans in all participants were completed by using an EBT system (GE Imatron, South San Francisco, CA). Interscan variability was defined by the following formula: abs (scan A - scan B) / (0.5 x scan A + 0.5 x scan B) x 100%, where A and B denote the first and second scan, respectively, of the dual scan procedure performed before treatment. We evaluated the reproducibility of the cutpoints commonly used for calcium scores clinically, namely 1-30, 31-100, 101-400, and >400.", 
    "90": "The CAC interscan variability was 11.8% using the Agatston score and 10.3% using the volume score. The reproducibility was then assessed using cutpoints 1-30, 31-100, 101-400, and >400. Agatston score variability for the four subgroups was 61.3%, 23%, 16.1%, and 8.2%, respectively (mean variability, 11.8%). Volume score variability was 60.0%, 14.4%, 14.6%, and 7.7%, respectively (mean variability, 10.3%).

    "92": "Recent studies have shown that statins might have relevant effects on insulin resistance in animal models and in humans. However, the molecular mechanisms that account for this improvement in insulin sensitivity are not well established. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of a statin on insulin sensitivity and insulin signaling in liver and muscle of rats fed on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks, treated or not with lovastatin during the last week. Our data show that treatment with lovastatin results in a marked improvement in insulin sensitivity characterized by an increase in glucose disappearance rate during the insulin tolerance test. This increase in insulin sensitivity was associated with an increase in insulin-induced insulin receptor (IR) tyrosine phosphorylation and, in parallel, a decrease in IR serine phosphorylation and association with PTP1B. Our data also show that lovastatin treatment was associated with an increase in insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in the liver and muscle of HFD-fed rats in parallel with a decrease in the inflammatory pathway (c-jun N-terminal kinase and I kappa beta kinase (IKKbeta)/inhibitor of kappaB/nuclear factor kappaB) related to insulin resistance. In summary, statin treatment improves insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed rats by reversing the decrease in the insulin-stimulated IRS-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway in liver and muscle. The effect of statins on insulin action is further supported by our findings that HFD rats treated with statin show a reduction in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, I kappa kinase (IKK)/inhibitor of kappaB/nuclear factor kappaB pathway, and c-jun N-terminal kinase activity, associated with an improvement in insulin action. Overall, these results provide important new insight into the mechanism of statin action in insulin sensitivity.", 
    "93": "Recent studies demonstrated in vivo the effectiveness of statins in reducing the inflammatory response in rheumatic diseases, and still more recently, simvastatin has been reported to inhibit in vitro IL-6 and IL-8 production by unstimulated fibroblast-like-synoviocytes (FLS) from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. However, no data are available on the effect of statins on the production of these cytokines induced by IL-1, which plays a crucial role in joint inflammation in the course of active RA in vivo.", 
    "94": "In 12 RA patients, synovial tissue specimens were taken to obtain cultures of FLS. Cultures were incubated with IL-1 +/- simvastatin (5-50 micromol/l), and IL-6 and IL-8 production was evaluated (ELISA), also following the addition of mevalonate and its isoprenoid derivatives. Moreover, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation (immunocytochemistry and Western Blot analysis) were also evaluated.", 
    "95": "Culture incubation with IL-1 produced a dramatic increase (up to 40-fold) in cytokine production with respect to unstimulated cells. Simvastatin significantly inhibited (about 20%) IL-6 and IL-8 production from IL-1-stimulated FLS. This effect was completely reverted by the concomitant incubation with mevalonate or geranylgeraniol (but not farnesol or squalene). Moreover, simvastatin produced a clear-cut inhibition of IL-1-induced NF-kB activation.", 
    "96": "Simvastatin significantly inhibits the production of IL-6 and IL-8 also in IL-1-stimulated FLS, even though to a lesser extent than in unstimulated cells, via a HMG-CoA-reductase block with an interference in prenylation process and NF-kB activation. Our results further support the rationale for the use of statins in the treatment of rheumatoid synovitis.", 
    "97": "In order to prevent cardiovascular events, it is essential to effectively manage overall risk of cardiovascular disease. However, despite guideline recommendations to this effect, current management of the major, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia is disconnected and patient adherence to therapy is poor. This is particularly important for patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, who are often prescribed multiple medications. The JEWEL study program investigated the use of single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin as a strategy to improve management of these patients. The JEWEL program consisted of two 16-week, international, open-label, multicenter, titration-to-goal studies in patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. The two studies differed based on country of enrollment and certain tertiary endpoints, but the overall designs were very similar. Patients were enrolled from 255 centers across Canada and 13 European countries. The study was designed to assess the efficacy, safety, and utility of amlodipine/atorvastatin single-pill therapy in a real-world setting. Patients were initiated at a dose of amlodipine 5 mg/atorvastatin 10 mg, unless previously treated, and were uptitrated as necessary. The primary efficacy parameter was the percentage of patients, at different levels of cardiovascular risk, achieving country-specific guideline-recommended target levels for blood pressure and lipids. A secondary analysis of efficacy measured attainment of the same single goal for blood pressure across all study participants (JEWEL I and II) and the same single goal for LDL-C across all study participants (JEWEL I and II). The program utilized a newly developed questionnaire to gain better understanding of participants' beliefs and behaviors towards medical treatment of their multiple risk factors. Approximately 2850 patients were enrolled in the program, which was completed in August 2005. The JEWEL program assessed the effectiveness of a single pill (amlodipine/atorvastatin) in targeting the two principal risk factors for cardiovascular disease simultaneously to achieve nationally applicable treatment targets in a routine clinical practice setting.", 
    "98": "The use of enoxaparin in conjunction with thrombolysis in ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI), has been recently investigated in several clinical trials. In 8 published open-label studies including about 10,000 patients, in which enoxaparin was compared to either placebo or unfractionated heparin (UFH), a general superiority of enoxaparin on both reinfarction/recurrent angina and patency of the infarct-related artery, was observed. Overall, bleeding rate with enoxaparin was higher than with placebo and comparable to UFH, with the exception of one study where pre-hospital administration induced a doubled incidence of intracranial bleeding in patients older than 75 years. In a recent double-blind, randomized, mega-trial including over 20,000 patients, the superior efficacy on in-hospital and 30-day adverse cardiac events (namely reinfarction), and comparable safety on intracranial bleedings of enoxaparin compared to UFH, was definitively proven. In conclusion, initial intravenous bolus of enoxaparin followed by twice daily subcutaneous administration for about 1 week should be considered instead of intravenous UFH for the treatment of patients with STEMI receiving thrombolysis. Along with its easiness of use, not requiring laboratory monitoring, the subcutaneous administration of enoxaparin allows extended antithrombotic treatment, while permitting early mobilization (and rehabilitation) of patients.", 
    "99": "Over the past decade, 17 large placebo-controlled trials have established that statin therapy lowers LDL cholesterol and prevents cardiovascular events and death in patients with coronary disease or at high risk for atherosclerotic events. Nine trials of higher dose vs. lower dose statins (reporting data from 29,853 patients with coronary artery disease and 486 patients with other indications for statin therapy) have established that higher dose statin therapy is more efficacious than lower dose therapy in reducing myocardial infarctions/coronary death (by 16%) and stroke (by 18%) in patients with coronary disease but only reduces all-cause mortality in patients at high risk for coronary death (such as patients immediately after acute coronary syndrome). Higher dose statins are associated with statistically significantly increased risks of myopathy and elevated transaminases compared to lower dose statins; while relative risks for these outcomes are 1.2 and 4.0, the absolute increases are small (0.5% and 1%). Secondary analyses of these trials using individual patient data and multivariate adjustment will be needed to appropriately examine the incremental benefits of different LDL targets, and trials are needed to determine whether combinations of low dose statins plus other lipid lowering agents may achieve better clinical outcomes than higher dose statin therapy alone.", 
    "100": "The clinical benefits of statins are strongly related to their low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering properties. However, because mevalonic acid (MVA), the product of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase reaction, is the precursor not only of cholesterol but also of nonsteroidal isoprenoid compounds, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase may result in pleiotropic effects, independent of their hypocholesterolemic properties. The discrimination between the pleiotropic from LDL-C lowering effects may potentially be more evident during the early phase of treatment since plasma MVA levels drop up to 70% within 1-2 hours while a reduction of LDL-C, detectable after 24 hours, became significant after 6-7 days. Therefore, the deprivation of circulating MVA-derived isoprenoids in the early phase of treatment could be the main mechanism responsible for the atheroprotective effect of statins. This early window of protection in the absence of LDL-C lowering suggests that the anti-inflammatory and the pleiotropic properties of statins may have clinical importance. Therefore, acute coronary syndromes could represent a clinical condition for addressing the early benefits of statins therapy, ie, within 24 h of the event, independent of LDL-C lowering.",

However, the blockade of isoprenylation elicited by statin treatment also has biological effects on cell function that go beyond the decrease in cholesterol synthesis: these are the so-called \"pleiotropic\" effects that mainly relate to vascular function. Endothelial dysfunction is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events that correlates with inflammation markers/mediators and robust predictors of cardiovascular diseases such as increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels. The results of in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the statins have beneficial effects unrelated to cholesterol lowering, such as improving endothelial function, increasing myocardial perfusion, and enhancing the availability of nitric oxide. This review describes the pleiotropic effects of statins that may be involved in modulating/preventing endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory processes, as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which they improve endothelial function.",

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) plays the role of a carrier and the site of action of this enzyme. According to a majority of authors, PON1 acts as an antioxidant, preventing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) peroxidation. However, due to the fact that in vivo serum PON1 is predominantly associated with HDL, its major physiological role might be to protect HDL, rather than LDL, from oxidation. Nevertheless, the physiological substrate of PON1 still remains to be discovered. The objective of this study was to determine changes in PON1 activity during treatment with simvastatin (CAS 79902-63-9, Lipex) in patients with type IIa and/or IIb hyperlipoproteinemia. PON1 activity was assessed in 32 patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa or IIb with an LDL cholesterol concentration higher than 4.2 mmol/l. Patients received simvastatin in a daily dose of 20 mg. The lipid status and PON1 activity were assessed at baseline, as well as 3 and 6 months after the beginning of treatment. The study demonstrated a statistically significant lipid lowering effect of simvastatin on total and LDL cholesterol, and an increase in PON1 activity in patients with both types of hyperlipoproteinemia. No statistically significant correlation was observed either between changes in PON1 activity and HDL, HDL2, HDL3 and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, or between their first differences in patients with both type IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia. The obtained results suggest that the antioxidant properties of simvastatin might be caused by a mechanism independent of apoAI-containing lipoprotein concentration. The antioxidant properties of simvastatin, which play an important role in HDL protection from oxidation, could be the mechanism inducing the increase in PON1 activity.",

However, we had demonstrated that simvastatin-induced HO-1 increased apoptosis of Neuro 2A cells in glucose deprivation, and iron production from HO-1 activity may be responsible for the toxicity. This study was designed to explore the effect of simvastatin-induced HO-1 on cultured Neuro 2A and C6 cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that the HO-1 upregulation was significantly associated with increased nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation, manifested as IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation, as well as increased production of superoxides. Inhibition of the induced HO-1 by zinc protoporphyrin reduced the increased NF-kappaB activation and superoxides production. RNA interference with HO-1 siRNA reduced the expression of HO-1 transcripts and protein as well as oxygen radical production. Addition of the iron chelator desferrioxamine to reduce the accumulation of ferric iron from heme by HO-1 resulted in blockade of the aggravated oxygen radical production. There was no significant effect on production of oxygen radicals under these conditions in the presence of a CO donor (RuCO) or a CO scavenger (hemoglobin). In addition, the viable cells were significantly decreased in 48 h in those cells receiving simvastatin pretreatment plus LPS compared to those in control or exposed to simvastatin or LPS alone. This study revealed that simvastatin-induced HO-1 led to increased NF-kappaB activation and superoxides production in the neuronal cells when exposed to LPS, and iron production may play a role in such a response.",

We tested whether the glucoside, its aglycon or geraniol has an impact on the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the key regulatory enzyme of the mevalonate pathway and also the iridoid biosynthesis. To address the inhibition site of the enzyme, initially a complete cDNA encoding full length HMGR was cloned from Phaedon cochleariae. Its catalytic portion was then heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Purification and characterization of the recombinant protein revealed attenuated activity in enzyme assays by 8-hydroxygeraniol whereas no effect has been observed by addition of the glucoside or geraniol. Thus, the catalytic domain is the target for the inhibitor. Homology modeling of the catalytic domain and docking experiments demonstrated binding of 8-hydroxygeraniol to the active site and indicated a competitive inhibition mechanism. Iridoid producing larvae are potentially able to sequester glucosidically bound 8-hydroxygeraniol whose cleavage of the sugar moiety results in 8-hydroxygeraniol. Therefore, HMGR may represent a regulator in maintenance of homeostasis between de novo produced and sequestered intermediates of iridoid metabolism.

Among those with CHD, 35% received the two treatments recommended in 1999 (beta-blockers and antiplatelet agents); in multivariate analyses, this two-treatment delivery was positively associated with male gender, self-reported hypertension and consulting a cardiologist.", 
    "159": "Cardiovascular risk profiles reported by providers in T2D people are high. Despite recent progress, there is a need for major improvement in practices intended to prevent cardiovascular disease in these people, especially in those at greatest CHD risk.", 
    "160": "7-Ketocholesterol (7kCh) is a major oxysterol found associated with vascular diseases. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) were cultured with different concentrations of 7kCh with and without inhibitors. Cell viabilities and caspase activities were assessed. 7kCh caused loss of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Caspases-8, -12, and -3/7 but not caspase-9 were activated by 7kCh treatment. The 7kCh-induced caspase-8 activity was blocked partially by pre-treatment with z-VAD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk, a caspase-8 inhibitor. However, pre-treatment with z-ATAD-fmk, a caspase-12 inhibitor, followed by 7kCh exposure lead to significantly increased caspase-8 activity. This suggests that caspase-8 and caspase-12 pathways have unique inhibition patterns and that caspase-12 is likely not upstream and feeding into caspase-8 but the pathways may function in parallel to each other. Caspase-3/7 activation was inhibited partially by low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), z-VAD-fmk (pan-caspase inhibitor), and low doses (0.01 and 0.001 microM) of the cholesterol lowering drug, simvastatin. However, only LDL partially protected against 7kCh-induced loss of cell viability suggesting that caspase-independent pathways also contributed to the cell loss and that protection from oxysterol damage may require inhibition of multiple pathways. Moreover, our data suggest that oxysterols such as 7kCh can damage HMVECs cells in part via caspase-dependent apoptosis and may play a role in vascular and retinal diseases.", 
    "161": "Connexin43 (Cx43) is the predominant gap junction protein in heart and is involved in the control of cell-to-cell communication to modulate the contractility and the electrical coupling of cardiac myocytes. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy is accompanied by changes of Cx43 expression. Recent studies have demonstrated that statins reduced cardiac hypertrophy. However, it is unknown whether statins can affect Cx43 expression in hypertrophied left ventricular myocardium. This study was designed to assess the effects of atorvastatin on LV hypertrophy and Cx43 expression in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).", 
    "162": "Nine-week old SHRs were randomly divided into two groups. Some received atorvastatin at 30 mg/kg by oral gavage once daily for 8 weeks (SHR-A); others received vehicle. Age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) received atorvastatin or vehicle for 8 weeks were used as controls. At the end of the experiment, we investigated LV hypertrophy and the expression of Cx43 in LV myocardium in four groups. Cx43 expression was investigated by the methods of Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscope. LV hypertrophy was accessed by pathological analysis and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level.", 
    "163": "LV hypertrophy was prominent in untreated SHR. In SHR, LV myocardium Cx43 level was upregulated, and the distribution of Cx43 was displaced from their usual locations to other sites at various distances away from the intercalated disks. After atorvastatin treatment, myocardium Cx43 level was reduced in SHR-A, and the distribution of Cx43 gap junction became much regular and confined to intercalated disk. Statins also prevented LV hypertrophy in SHR.", 
    "164": "These results provide novel in vivo evidence for the key role of Cx43 gap junctions in LV hypertrophy and the possible mechanism in anti-hypertrophic effect of statins. Atorvastatin treatment may have beneficial effects on LV hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "165": "Lipid abnormalities, and especially hypertriglyceridaemia, are a prominent feature of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The results from several studies have shown that statins are effective and safe lipid-lowering agents in these individuals. Besides lipid lowering, current evidence suggests that these agents exert multiple beneficial effects on PD patients. Statins may maintain residual kidney function by altering the response of the kidneys to dyslipidaemia and, thus, slow the progression of renal failure in PD patients. Also, statins may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, as well as morbidity and mortality rates in this high-risk group. However, despite the multiple beneficial effects, PD patients receive suboptimal statin treatment. Apart from the German Dialysis and Diabetes (4D) study, no other prospective, randomised controlled trial has investigated the effects of statin treatment on dialysis patients. The results of large-scale, multi-centre randomised controlled studies (such as AURORA and SHARP) are expected to define the role of statin therapy in this high-risk population.", 
    "166": "The results of several cross-sectional trials suggest that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have increased vascular risk and cardiovascular mortality. It was demonstrated that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of both RA and atherosclerosis. This association may explain the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in RA patients. A number of recent studies show that routine statin use in patients with RA offers considerable advantages. Statin treatment has been supported to exert a beneficial effect on disease activity, swollen joint count, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness in RA patients. These improvements are coupled with a mild to moderate improvement in plasma markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Statins have a satisfactory safety profile with relatively few adverse effects. In the absence of side effects and contraindications, it may be reasonable to consider statin use in selected cases, particularly in patients with a long history of active RA who are at increased cardiovascular risk.",

After a 12-week diet period, atorvastatin was initiated at a dose of 10 mg per day. After six weeks, LDL-C was determined, and if the levels were <80 or <104 mg/dL for SP and PP, respectively, two atorvastatin doses were subtracted per week. If LDL-C remained <80 or <104 mg/dL, a further reduction to three times a week was allowed, and the last determination was performed after six more weeks. The percentage variation in costs was the parameter to evaluate the saving.", 
    "170": "In 47 out of the 52 patients of this group, a reduction by 32% in LDL-C was observed, and daily atorvastatin was maintained. Forty one patients remained throughout the study and had their weekly dosage reduced. In 25 patients the medication was administered three times a week, and in 16, five times a week, with reductions of 42.4% and 46.1% in LDL-C, respectively. As regards costs, one of the groups had their monthly expense reduced from R$ 106.65 to R$ 74.65, and the other group from R$ 106.65 to R$ 53.33.",

    "172": "Statins have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to a reduction in plasma cholesterol. However, statins seem to have effects beyond the lowering of plasma cholesterol. We hypothesize that these effects are caused by an effect on renal function.", 
    "173": "We measured the effects of atorvastatin (AS) on renal function in two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded and crossover studies in healthy man. In an acute trial (Study 1), 19 subjects received either 80 mg AS as a single dose or placebo. In a short-term trial (Study 2), 20 subjects received either 80 mg AS or placebo daily for 4 weeks. In both studies glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), plasma concentrations of angiotensin II (Ang II), renin (PRC), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), aldosterone (Aldo), vasopressin (AVP) and blood pressure (BP) were determined.",

    "175": "An acute dose of AS decreased FE(Na) and DBP in healthy humans. The reduction in fractional urinary sodium excretion was very modest and transitory, and most likely secondary to the fall in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). However, renal haemodynamics, tubular function, vasoactive hormones and blood pressure were unchanged during short-term statin treatment in healthy man.", 
    "176": "Germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene PTEN predispose to heritable breast cancer. The transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) has also been implicated as a tumor suppressor pertinent to a range of neoplasias, including breast cancer. We previously demonstrated that lovastatin may signal through PPARgamma and directly upregulate PTEN expression at the transcriptional level. In our current study, we show that simvastatin, pravastatin and fluvastatin can induce PTEN expression in a dose-dependent manner. This resulted from an increase in PTEN mRNA indicating transcriptional upregulation. In addition, we observed, for the first time, that upregulation of sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP), known to induce PPARgamma expression, can increase PTEN expression. Using reporter assays, we observed that both the statins and SREBP could specifically induce PPARgamma-mediated transcription. However, the statins do not appear to signal through SREBP. Furthermore, our results indicate that SREBP utilizes PPARgamma's transcriptional activity to induce PTEN transcription, whereas the statins signal through PPARgamma's protein activity to upregulate PTEN expression. Overall, our observations suggest that statins signal through another transcription factor, in a PPARgamma-dependent manner, which in turn induces PTEN transcription. We, therefore, studied the full-length PTEN promoter through serial deletion reporter assays and electromobility shift assays and identified a region between -854 and -791 that binds an as-yet-unidentified transcription factor, through which the statins induce PTEN expression. Since PTEN is constitutively active, our data indicate it may be worthwhile to examine statin and SREBP stimulation as mechanisms to increase PTEN expression for therapeutic and preventative strategies in cancer, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "177": "Statins inhibit oxidative stress, but the interplay between cholesterol lowering and antioxidant vitamins is still unclear. Aims of the study were to assess if statins inhibit oxidative stress independently from cholesterol lowering, to assess the behaviour of vitamin E simultaneously with the changes of oxidative stress, to determine in vitro if atorvastatin was able to directly influence platelet-mediated LDL oxidation and vitamin E consumption.", 
    "178": "In 30 hypercholesterolaemic patients (HC) and 20 healthy subjects (HS), urinary isoprostanes and plasma vitamin E were determined. The HC were randomized to diet or diet plus atorvastatin 10 mg/day. Compared with HS, HC had higher isoprostanes and lower vitamin E levels. The statin-allocated group showed a reduction of isoprostanes after only 3 days (-18.8%, P < 0.01); after 30 days, a stronger reduction of isoprostanes was noted (-37.1%, P < 0.01) whereas an increase of vitamin E (+42%, P < 0.01) and a reduction of cholesterol (-24.9%, P < 0.01) were observed. The diet-allocated group showed a weak decrease of cholesterol after 30 days. In vitro study showed that atorvastatin dose-dependently inhibited platelet-mediated LDL oxidation and isoprostane formation with a mechanism involving NADPH-oxidase.",

From Austrian sickness funds claims, we identified all acute MI patients who were discharged within 30 days and who survived >or=120 days after MI in 2004. We ascertained outpatient use of ACEI/ARBs, BBs, statins, and aspirin from all filled prescriptions between discharge and 120 days post MI. Comorbidities were ascertained from use of indicator drugs during the preceding year. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent determinants of study drug use. We evaluated 4,105 MI patients, whose mean age was 68.8 (+/-13.2) years; 59.5% were men. Within 120 days after MI, 67% filled prescriptions for ACE/ARBs, 74% for BBs, and 67% for statin. While 41% received all these classes and 34% two, 25% of patients received only one or none of these drugs. Older age and presence of severe mental illness were associated with lower use of all drug classes. Diabetics had greater ACEI/ARB use. Fewer BBs were used in patients with obstructive lung disease. Statin use was lower in patients using treatment for congestive heart failure (all P<0.001). We conclude that recommended medications were underused in Austrian MI survivors. Quality indicators should be established and interventions be implemented to ensure maximum secondary prevention after MI.", 
    "181": "Liver X receptors (LXRs) alpha and ss belong to a family of nuclear receptors which form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor and, upon ligand binding, stimulate the expression of target genes. LXRs were initially described as orphan receptors and oxidized cholesterol derivatives (oxysterols) were later identified as their natural ligands. In addition, several synthetic LXR agonists such as T0901317 and GW3965 were synthesized. Oxysterols are formed in amounts proportional to cholesterol content in the cell and therefore the LXRs operate as cholesterol sensors which protect from cholesterol overload by: 1) inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption, 2) stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoproteins through the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, 3) activating the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver, and (4) activating biliary cholesterol and bile acid excretion. In addition, LXR agonists activate de novo fatty acid synthesis by stimulating the expression of a lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), leading to the elevation of plasma triglycerides and liver steatosis. Here we describe the structure and function of the LXRs, their endo- and exogenous agonists and antagonists, the regulation of LXR expression and activity, and their role in the regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. In the accompanying article we characterize other effects of LXRs, alterations in LXR expression, and changes in the level of their endogenous agonists in pathological conditions as well as therapeutic implications.",

Increased SVZ neurosphere formation and cell proliferation were found in cultured neurospheres derived from normal rat and poststroke rat SVZs treated in vitro with atorvastatin compared with untreated neurospheres (P<0.05). Atorvastatin significantly increased PS1 and hairy and enhancer of split1 (Hes1) gene expression in cultured SVZ neurospheres. Inhibition of PS1 significantly decreased NICD expression. Short interfering RNA knockdown of Notch1 expression, decreased NPC proliferation, and NICD and hairy and enhancer of split1 expression in cultured neurosphere cells.",

Despite incomplete correction of insulin sensitivity, rosuvastatin fully corrected BP and its variability (P = 0.01), in conjunction with upregulation of PPARgamma (but not PPARalpha) in the aortic arch. Rosuvastatin similarly increased PPARgamma (P = 0.002) and SOD1 (P = 0.01) expression in isolated endothelial cells.

    "189": "In 2005, a global goal of reducing chronic disease death rates by an additional 2% per year was established. Scaling up coverage of evidence-based interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease in high-risk individuals in low-income and middle-income countries could play a major part in reaching this goal. We aimed to estimate the number of deaths that could be averted and the financial cost of scaling up, above current coverage levels, a multidrug regimen for prevention of cardiovascular disease (a statin, aspirin, and two blood-pressure-lowering medicines) in 23 such countries. Identification of individuals was limited to those already accessing health services, and treatment eligibility was based on the presence of existing cardiovascular disease or absolute risk of cardiovascular disease by use of easily measurable risk factors. Over a 10-year period, scaling up this multidrug regimen could avert 17.9 million deaths from cardiovascular disease (95% uncertainty interval 7.4 million-25.7 million). 56% of deaths averted would be in those younger than 70 years, with more deaths averted in women than in men owing to larger absolute numbers of women at older ages. The 10-year financial cost would be US$47 billion ($33 billion-$61 billion) or an average yearly cost per head of $1.08 ($0.75-1.40), ranging from $0.43 to $0.90 across low-income countries and from $0.54 to $2.93 across middle-income countries. This package could effectively meet three-quarters of the proposed global goal with a moderate increase in health expenditure.", 
    "190": "While increases in prescription drug spending have moderated in recent years, drug spending is still a concern among managed care organizations and health plan administrators. In order to minimize cost increases from year to year, many health care plans have shifted more of the cost of medications to the member-consumer. Coinsurance, a benefit design in which the patient pays a percentage of the cost of the medication, is garnering more attention as a type of cost-sharing that differs from the traditional copayment model.",

On September 1, 2005, a 4-tier coinsurance benefit design (25% for all tiers except tier-3 [non-preferred] drugs at 50%, with minimum and maximum patient out-of-pocket [OOP] cost applied to each tier) was implemented in the intervention group (N = 46,311). The 3-tier copayment design was maintained in the comparison group (N = 7,916). A difference-in-difference analysis was used to estimate the effect of the benefit design change on expenditures and utilization, overall (for all prescription drugs), and for 3 classes of essential medications: antihypertensives, antidepressants, and statins. Analyses measured changes in outcomes from 6 months pre-change (October 1, 2004, through March 31, 2005) through 6 months post-change (October 1, 2005, through March 31, 2006).

Recently, there is a growing body of evidence, that statins exert effects by much exceeding the effect of cholesterol level decrease. Inhibition of earlier stages of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (not influencing the very cholesterol level) results in blocking the intermediate metabolite synthesis; isoprenoids (farnesyl phosphate and geranyl phosphate), which play a regulatory function in cells. Statins have antiatherosclerotic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antithrombotic effects. It applies equally to diseases of chronic inflammation type, as to those, where bone metabolism is disturbed. It is well known that statins decrease bone fracture risk; through bone formation intensification, and inhibition of bone tissue resorption. Slowing down the atherosclerosis progression is a very important effect, considering that in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) we are dealing with premature and rapid progression of atherosclerotic lesions. In this paper statins pathways of action in rheumatic diseases (including pleiotropic effects), and their potential use in rheumatology have been discussed. Though there is lack of reliable data enabling statins introduction to standard complementary therapy in rheumatic diseases, the results however of completed studies allow concluding of their utility. The statins that were most frequently evaluated in clinical studies were simvastatin and atorvastatin. Studies on statins have been performed in RA, SLE, osteoporosis and systemic vasculotos.",

Change in IMT is one of the currently used markers to evaluate the progression of atherosclerotic process. In particular rosuvastatin (ROS) has demonstrated in a large scale controlled study with placebo a significant reduction of coronary atherosclerosis. Two subjects with normal lipidic profile underwent a carotid ultrasound investigations (CUI) and received ROS (10 mg/day). The CUI documented a bilateral IMT of CCDX and CCSX for the case A (0.101 cm dx-0.105 cm sx; mean 0.103 cm) and B (0.114 cm dx-0.108 cm sx; mean 0.111 cm), in absence of stenosis or occlusion. After 16 treatment-weeks with ROS it has found a significant reduction of IMT for both case A (0.081 cm dx -0.096 cm sx; mean 0.088 cm) than case B (0.082 cm dx-0.084 cm sx; mean 0.083 cm). The treatment with ROS has been well tolerated and no adverse effects has been reported. ROS represents an efficacious IMT-lowering agent of the statin class. The two presented case reports confirm the benefit of ROS in the IMT reduction in subjects with normal LDL-C values."
