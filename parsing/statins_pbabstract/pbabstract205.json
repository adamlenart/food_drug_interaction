Percentage diameter stenosis (P = 0.039) and diastolic BP (P = 0.005) in the IT group were significantly decreased compared with those in the CT group at follow-up. In addition, percentage diameter stenosis was most significantly related to the level of LDL-C (P = 0.03) among other metabolic factors (BP, body mass index, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, and adiponectin) at follow-up as assessed by a stepwise multivariable regression analysis.",

In primary prevention the odds for statin prescription increased with estimated cardiovascular risk (OR 1.17 per 5% increase in 5-year risk, 95% CI 1.11-1.22). Positive predictors for statin prescription were secondary prevention, hypertension, former smoking, baseline LDL-cholesterol, and microalbuminuria.

A combination of statins with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) or HCV nonstructural (NS)5B polymerase or NS3 protease inhibitors results in an additive antiviral activity in short-term (3 days) antiviral assays. Neither statins, at a concentration of five-fold their median effective concentration (EC(50)) value, nor polymerase, protease inhibitors, or IFN-alpha, at concentrations 10- or 20-fold their EC(50) value, were able to clear cells from their replicon following four or six consecutive passages of antiviral pressure. However, the combination of HCV polymerase or protease inhibitors with mevastatin or simvastatin resulted in an efficient clearance of the cultures from their replicon.

We sought to examine the differences in the platelets response to shear stress in patients with PAD compared to those with CAD. Men with symptomatic PAD (ankle brachial index [ABI] < 0.9; n = 29) were compared with similarly aged men with CAD (post coronary artery bypass grafting; n = 40) but without PAD. All participants were on aspirin, and none were on clopidogrel. We measured changes in shear-induced platelet aggregation (SIPA) and shear-induced P-selectin expression (SIPE) under fluid shear rates of 5000 and 10,000 s(-1)which are typically found in arterioles and stenosed arteries, respectively. Aggregation was also induced by a combined stimulation of collagen, fluid shear stress, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or epinephrine using a platelet function analyzer (PFA-100) as well as optical aggregometry (arachidonic acid, collagen and epinephrine). Analyses of covariance adjusted for age, aspirin dose, and statin use were used to estimate differences between the groups. Values of SIPA at fluid shear rates of 5000 and 10,000 s(-1) were significantly higher in the PAD group, while there were no differences between the PAD and CAD groups in SIPE at both fluid shear rates. However, baseline shear-induced P-selectin expression was higher in patients with PAD than CAD (mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] = 2.93 +/- 1.37 vs.1.94 +/- 0.67; p = 0.01), while the percentage increases in SIPA and SIPE at fluid shear rates of 5000 and 10,000 s(-1) were significantly higher in patients with CAD when compared to PAD (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Although there were several similarities in platelet function between men with PAD and men with CAD, significant differences in platelet responses to shear stress were observed in men with PAD when compared to those with CAD. Although the mechanism for these observed differences are not clear, we hypothesize that in vivo platelet activation in PAD patients may contribute to the differences and will need to be further investigated.", 
    "23": "ER niacin combined with simvastatin provides an additional option for achieving LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals for cardiovascular prevention, with greater efficacy in those with triglyceride levels >200 mg/dL. ER niacin 1000 mg combined with simvastatin 20 mg reduced LDL-C by 6%, non-HDL-C by 7%, and triglycerides by 13%, and raised HDL-C by 11% compared to simvastatin 20 mg alone. The 2000 mg dose combined with simvastatin 20 to 40 mg raised reduced LDL-C by 7% to 24%, non-HDL-C by 16% to 28%, and triglycerides by 23% to 34%, and increased HDL-C by 18% to 22% compared to similar dose simvastatin therapy. While cardiovascular risk is reduced in proportion to the magnitude of LDL-C lowering, the additive benefit of raising HDL-C and lowering triglycerides remains to be determined. ER niacin-simvastatin is reasonably well tolerated, with a <7% discontinuation rate due to flushing in patients who used aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications as needed. However, drop-out rates were high in both the simvastatin and ER niacin-simvastatin treatment groups in both the 24- and 52-week studies. The safety profile of the combination appears to be similar to that of niacin and simvastatin used as monotherapies. Results of ongoing morbidity/mortality trials of ER niacin added to statin therapy are eagerly awaited.",

    "36": "Rosuvastatin is a synthetic statin that represents an advance in the pharmacologic and clinical properties of statins. Relative to other statins, rosuvastatin possesses a greater number of binding interactions with HMG-CoA reductase and has a high affinity for the active site of the enzyme. As with other statins, serious adverse effects with rosuvastatin therapy are uncommon and primarily involve effects on the liver and skeletal muscle. The risk increases with increasing dosages and coadministration with other drugs interacting with the same metabolic pathway. The degree of LDL reduction is important to achieve the treatment goals suggested by international guidelines. Among the most potent statins, rosuvastatin is capable of getting the majority of patients to their LDL cholesterol goals. In addition, rosuvastatin has been found effective in reducing small-dense LDL, C-reactive protein and in increasing HDL cholesterol levels. Controlled clinical trials using vascular end-points have been performed. In particular, a study demonstrated that rosuvastatin therapy could slow progression and/or cause regression of carotid intima-media thickness over 2 years in middle-aged individuals with a low Framingham risk score (FRS) and mild to moderate subclinical atherosclerosis. A primary prevention study (JUPITER) was stopped before the programmed end of the study, because of excess benefit for high-risk individuals receiving rosuvastatin treatment. It is suggested that pronounced LDL reduction, in association with significant HDL cholesterol increase, are the bases of a marked preventive action of rosuvastatin. The results from JUPITER support the use of rosuvastatin for primary cardiovascular prevention, in overweight men and women, with near to normal LDL cholesterol and high CRP. There is now evidence of benefit from rosuvastatin treatment for a wide segment of the general population at intermediate cardiovascular risk. In absolute numbers, this segment represents the main source of cardiovascular events: on the basis of JUPITER results, it is expected that treatment target and potential candidates to statin therapy will be reevaluated and redefined.",

Carotid endarterectomy in addition to best medical therapy is of proven benefit in reducing the risk of ipsilateral stroke compared with best medical therapy alone in patients with symptomatic high-grade stenosis, provided the operation can be performed safely. Although limited, data are available to support carotid angioplasty/stenting in patients with symptomatic high-grade stenosis in whom endarterectomy is not feasible because of anatomic or other technical factors.

However, little is known about the mechanisms of action of different statins or the effects of these statins in gynaecological malignancies. The apoptotic potential of two lipophilic statins (lovastatin and simvastatin) and one hydrophilic statin (pravastatin) was assessed in cancer cell lines (ovarian, endometrial and cervical) and primary cultured cancerous and normal tissues. Cell viability was studied by MTS assays and apoptosis was confirmed by Western blotting of PARP and flow cytometry. The expressions of key apoptotic cascade proteins were analysed. Our results demonstrate that both lovastatin and simvastatin, but not pravastatin, selectively induced cell death in dose- and time-dependent manner in ovarian, endometrial and cervical cancers. Little or no toxicity was observed with any statin on normal cells. Lipophilic statins induced activation of caspase-8 and -9; BID cleavage, cytochrome C release and PARP cleavage. Statin-sensitive cancers expressed high levels of HMG-CoA reductase compared with resistant cultures. The effect of lipophilic statins was dependent on inhibition of enzymatic activity of HMG-CoA reductase since mevalonate pre-incubation almost completely abrogated the apoptotic effect. Moreover, the apoptotic effect involved the inhibition of synthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate rather than farnesyl pyrophosphate. In conclusion, lipophilic but not hydrophilic statins induce cell death through activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic cascades in cancerous cells from the human female genital tract, which express high levels of HMG-CoA reductase. These results promote further investigation in the use of lipophilic statins as anticancer agents in gynaecological malignancies.",

Both high-cholesterol diets given to ameliorate cholesterol deficiency while decreasing 7-DHC and cholesterol-enriched diets plus simvastatin to further decrease sterol synthesis have been used as potential therapies. However, the effect of dietary cholesterol and simvastatin on cholesterol synthesis in SLOS has not been reported. Twelve subjects with SLOS enrolled in the study: Nine had received a high cholesterol diet (HI) for 3 y and three were studied after 4 wk on a low cholesterol diet (LO). Cholesterol fractional synthesis rate (FSR) was measured after oral administration of deuterium oxide, using gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry. FSR was lower in HI compared with LO (HI: 1.46 +/- 0.62%/d; LO: 4.77 +/- 0.95%/d; p < 0.001). Three HI subjects were retested after 0.8 y taking simvastatin (HI + ST). Simvastatin tended to reduce FSR and significantly decreased (p < 0.01) plasma 7-DHC compared with cholesterol supplementation alone. The study demonstrates the utility of the deuterium incorporation method to understand the effect of therapeutic interventions in SLOS. The data suggest that dietary cholesterol supplementation reduces cholesterol synthesis in SLOS and further support the rationale for the combined treatment of SLOS with a cholesterol-enriched diet and simvastatin.",

Some statins had the potential to induce the expression of mRNAs for MDR1 and/or CYP3A in either form. The change in the mRNA expression of MDR1 was accompanied by a change in the CsA-dependent intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123. Simvastatin lactone, but not the acid form, exhibited a strong inductive effect on the mRNA expression of MDR1 and CYP3A in a dose-dependent manner. Sulforaphane significantly suppressed the expression of MDR1 and CYP3A mRNAs induced by atorvastatin lactone, lovastatin acid, and lovastatin lactone, comparable to the control level, and moderately inhibited that by cerivastatin acid, fluvastatin acid and simvastatin lactone. In the case of pitavastatin acid, sulforaphane had no significant effect on the expression of MDR1 mRNA.These results suggested that some statins could induce MDR1 and CYP3A gene expression and these inductive effects differed between the lactone and active hydroxy acid forms, and that PXR-mediated regulation was rarely associated with the mRNA inducibility by pitavastatin acid, unlike that by other statins.",

Explaining this outcome, caspase-3 activity decreased by 50% (p<0.05), and the histological TUNEL method revealed a decrease of approximately 20% in apoptotic cells at the injury site (p<0.01) at 4h post-SCI in atorvastatin-treated rats in comparison to vehicle-treated controls. These data demonstrate that atorvastatin is effective after experimental spinal cord contusion injury in preventing early apoptosis at the injury site within 2h post-administration.", 
    "60": "Clinical trials report that the class of drugs known as statins may be neuroprotective in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and further trials are currently underway to test whether these drugs are also beneficial in multiple sclerosis and acute stroke treatment. Since statins are well tolerated and have relatively few side effects, they may be considered as viable drugs to ameliorate neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism of their neuroprotective effects is only partly understood. In this article, we review the current data on the neuroprotective effects of statins and their underlying mechanisms. In the first section, we detail the mechanisms by which statins affect cellular signalling. The primary action of statins is to inhibit cellular cholesterol synthesis. However, the cholesterol synthesis pathway also has several by-products, the non-sterol isoprenoids that are also important in cellular functioning. Furthermore, reduced cholesterol levels may deplete the cholesterol-rich membrane domains known as lipid rafts, which in turn could affect cellular signalling. In the second section, we summarize how the effects on signalling translate into general neuroprotective effects through peripheral systems. Statins improve blood-flow, reduce coagulation, modulate the immune system and reduce oxidative damage. The final section deals with the effects of statins on the central nervous system, particularly during Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, stroke and multiple sclerosis.", 
    "61": "This study aimed to examine the transporter-mediated drug interaction between fexofenadine and fluvastatin in rats. Compared to the control group given fluvastatin alone, the concurrent use of fexofenadine (10 or 20mg/kg) prior to the oral administration of fluvastatin (5mg/kg) decreased the systemic exposure of fluvastatin by 17-51% in rats. Consequently, the bioavailability of oral fluvastatin was significantly lower (p<0.05) in the presence of fexofenadine compared to that from the control group. Furthermore, the intravenous pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin (2mg/kg) was significantly altered by the pretreatment with fexofenadine (20mg/kg, p.o.). The plasma clearance of fluvastatin was reduced by 44% in the presence of fexofenadine. The effect of fluvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine was also investigated in rats. The pretreatment with fluvastatin (5 or 10mg/kg) decreased AUC and C(max) of oral fexofenadine (10mg/kg) by 47-53% and 28-60%, respectively, while it did not affect the intravenous pharmacokinetics of fexofenadine. Given that both fluvastatin and fexofenadine can interact with organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) expressed in intestine and liver, the present results suggest the potential drug interaction between fluvastatin and fexofenadine via the competition for the OATP-mediated cellular transport pathway during intestinal absorption and/or hepatic uptake of drugs.", 
    "62": "Fibrates and statins activate the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). This nuclear receptor regulates genes governing inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress, three important mechanisms of neuronal death in Parkinson's disease (PD). We retrospectively studied the effect of statins and fibrates in a cohort of 419 patients with PD. In PD patients receiving either a statin or a fibrate, the mean age of disease onset was delayed by nearly 9 years, when compared with (control) PD patients not taking a lipid-lowering treatment. According to a mixed linear model, the increase in the levodopa-equivalent daily dose over 2 years was significantly smaller in the group taking a statin (+24 mg) than in the matched control group (+212 mg) (p=0.004), whereas the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score progression was similar. The course of the disease in patients taking a fibrate did not differ from the controls. These data suggest that lipid-lowering drugs may have a disease modifier effect, with a stronger action for statins than for fibrates.", 
    "63": "We investigated whether intensive cholesterol lowering could more effectively prevent heart failure (HF) in secondary prevention. The IDEAL study was a 4.8-year prospective, randomized trial comparing \"usual\" simvastatin treatment (20 to 40 mg/day, n = 4,449) with high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg/day, n = 4,439) in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). At baseline, 94% of patients (n = 8,351) had no history of HF. During the course of the trial, there were 222 new or recurrent hospitalizations for HF (57 and 165 in those with and without HF at baseline, respectively), 123 (2.8%) in the simvastatin group and 99 (2.2%) in the atorvastatin group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62 to 1.05, p = 0.11). After adjustments, atorvastatin 80 mg was associated with a 26% decrease of new HF events compared with simvastatin 20 to 40 mg (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.97, p = 0.03). Atorvastatin tended to be associated with fewer HF events in those with HF at baseline (n = 537, HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.11, p = 0.11) and those without HF at baseline (n = 8,351, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.09, p = 0.15). Also, HF without preceding MI (n = 187) was decreased (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.97, p = 0.03). In conclusion, atorvastatin 80 mg was more efficient than simvastatin 20 to 40 mg in preventing development of HF in patients with previous MI.", 
    "64": "Product information and national guidelines consistently recommend the estimation of serum alanine aminotranferase (ALT) before and after approximately 3 months as part of risk management following initiation of statin therapy. The aim of this study was to determine compliance to the recommendations for monitoring ALT in patients initiated on statin therapy. The prevalence of abnormal serum ALT levels was also evaluated and compared with current data. We performed a retrospective observational audit of the Medicine's Monitoring Unit (MEMO) prescribing record-linkage database, which includes evidence of prescribing and biochemistry results of all patients in Tayside, Scotland. We examined patients with first-time statin prescriptions and evaluated all laboratory liver function tests recorded before and after prescriptions from 1st January 2002 to 31st December 2002. Of the 5717 patients identified, 54% were male and the subjects had a mean age of 62 +/- 14 standard deviation (SD) years. The prescriptions yielded five types of statin and included the start date, dose, and number of tablets. In total, 1455 (25%) patients had no biochemistry data at all from the year 2002, and despite the 75% of patients who had an ALT measurement, over 90% of patients did not follow the current recommendations. The prevalence of elevated transaminases was consistent with published data in that significant elevation occurred in 1.9% of subjects. Adherence to the recommended laboratory monitoring for patients first prescribed with statin therapy is low in Tayside. Adverse drug reactions need to be more closely monitored by all healthcare professionals involved in prescribing. Monitoring can highlight abnormalities and therefore reduce potentially damaging effects.", 
    "65": "Cholesterol is an apparently indispensable lipid for numerous processes required for cell proliferation. Levels of this molecule are primarily regulated at the transcriptional level by the SREBPs (sterol-regulatory-element-binding proteins) and LXR (liver X receptor). In this issue of the Biochemical Journal, Rodr\u00edguez-Acebes et al. show that a cholesterol precursor, desmosterol, can support cell proliferation in the absence of cholesterol in a murine macrophage-like model (J774-D cells). These cells are defective in DHCR24 (sterol-Delta24-reductase, or 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta24-reductase), leading to desmosterol accumulation, and yet sterol homoeostasis appears to be normal with respect to SREBP processing and LXR activation. Other potentially cholesterol-dependent processes which were not the focus of this study are briefly discussed, such as lipid-raft-dependent cell signalling.",

They are broadly used for treating hypercholesterolemia and for prevention of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. Recent publications show that statins also act as immunomodulatory drugs. Here, we show that lipophilic statins inhibit NK-cell degranulation and cytotoxicity. This effect was reversible by addition of substrates of isoprenylation, but not by addition of cholesterol. In NK-target cell conjugates intracellular Ca(2+) flux was unaffected by statin treatment. However, statins strongly reduced the amount of conjugate formation between NK and target cells. This inhibition was paralleled by a statin-dependent inhibition of LFA-1-mediated adhesion and a reduction of NK-cell polarization. This demonstrates that statins impair the formation of effector-target cell conjugates resulting in the disruption of early signaling and the loss of NK-cell cytotoxicity.", 
    "72": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are lipid-lowering agents widely employed for atherosclerosis prevention. HMG-CoA reductase blockade reduces skeletal muscle coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) levels and mitochondrial respiratory chain activities and may produce mild to severe skeletal muscle myopathy. This study investigated whether high-dose statin treatment would result in measurably decreased exercise capacity in older men and women. Maximal oxygen consumption, aerobic endurance, oxygen uptake kinetics, maximal strength, muscular power, and muscular endurance were measured before and after 12 weeks of statin treatment (simvastatin, 80 mg/day) in nine men and one woman, ages 55-76 years, with LDL-cholesterol levels >3.3 mmol/l (mean = 4.2 +/- 0.2 mmol/l). Myalgia symptoms were assessed every 4 weeks. As expected, statin treatment resulted in significant decreases in LDL- and total-cholesterol levels (P < 0.01) with no significant changes in HDL-cholesterol or triglyceride levels. No significant changes were observed in aerobic capacity, endurance, oxygen kinetics or any measures of muscle function. No subject reported symptoms of myalgia, cramps, or weakness during the study. In the absence of myalgia or myopathic symptoms, high-dose simvastatin treatment did not impair exercise capacity in hyperlipidemic older individuals. We conclude that decreases in intramuscular CoQ(10), in most patients on high dose statin treatment may not be clinically relevant, due to inter-individual variability in the degree of CoQ(10) depletion, sensitivity of muscle to decreases in CoQ(10), or both.",

Bile acid sequestrants (otherwise known as resins), were among the first lipid-altering drugs shown capable of reducing the risk of coronary heart disease in clinical trials; more recently, lowering lipid concentrations by the use of statins (HMG coA-reductase inhibitors) has been proven to reduce cardiovascular and total mortality and these drugs are now recommended as first-line therapy in both primary and secondary CVD prevention. Colesevelam ([see symbol in text] Cholestagel--Genzyme), a new bile acid sequestrant, is licensed for use in the management of primary hypercholesterolaemia, either as monotherapy when statins are not tolerated or considered inappropriate, or as an adjunct to statin therapy in patients who are not adequately controlled on a statin alone.

The treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia to prevent cardiovascular disease is of increasing clinical and scientific interest. In the pathogenesis of this disease plasma triglycerides play a central role.

Furthermore, mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), atherogenic small dense LDL particles (sdLDL) emerge, and HDL cholesterol decreases. All these factors yield into a significantly increased atherogenesis and cardiovascular risk. Weight reduction and low fat diets have shown positive effects in general, but a specific therapy to treat diabetic dyslipidemia is still missing. Studies so far have failed to show a reliable benefit for fibrates and for nicotinic acid. Thus, statin therapy to decrease LDL cholesterol to target is the essential treatment for diabetic dyslipidemia to reduce cardiovascular risk. Other lipid lowering drugs can be added optionally.", 
    "96": "During acute myocardial infarction (AMI), ischemia leads to necrotic areas surrounded by border zones of reversibly damaged cardiomyocytes, showing membrane flip-flop. During reperfusion type IIA secretory phopholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-IIA) induces direct cell-toxicity and facilitates binding of other inflammatory mediators on these cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we hypothesized that the specific sPLA(2)-IIA-inhibitor PX-18 would reduce cardiomyocyte death and infarct size in vivo. Wistar rats were treated with PX-18 starting minutes after reperfusion, and at day 1 and 2 post AMI. After 28 days hearts were analyzed. Furthermore, the effect of PX-18 on membrane flip-flop and apoptosis was investigated in vitro. PX-18 significantly inhibited sPLA(2)-IIA activity and reduced infarct size (reduction 73 +/- 9%, P < 0.05), compared to the vehicle-treated group, without impairing wound healing. In vitro, PX-18 significantly reduced reversible membrane flip-flop and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. However, no sPLA(2)-IIA activity could be detected, suggesting that PX-18 also exerted a protective effect independent of sPLA(2)-IIA. In conclusion, PX-18 is a potent therapeutic to reduce infarct size by inhibiting sPLA(2)-IIA, and possibly also by inhibiting apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in a sPLA(2)-IIA independent manner.",

The characterization of the three different systems was performed with the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide angle X-ray diffractometry (WAXD). It was revealed that amorphization of the drug occurred in all of the solid dispersions of Fluvastatin as a result of drug dissolution into polymer matrices and due to physical interactions (hydrogen bonding) between the polymer matrix and Fluvastatin. This was established through the use of FTIR spectroscopy. SEM and micro-Raman spectroscopy showed that Fluvastatin was interspersed to the polymer matrices in the form of molecular dispersion and nanodispersion, too. The finding that completely different polymer matrices, used here as drug carriers, produce completely different dissolution profiles for each one of the solid dispersions, suggests that each matrix follows a different drug release mechanism. Hydrogen bonding interactions as in the case of CS/Fluva solid dispersions lead to controlled release profiles. All formulations were subjected to accelerated aging in order to evaluate Fluvastatin stability. From by-products analysis it was found that Fluvastatin is very unstable during storage and anti-isomer as well as lactones are the main formed by-products. On the other hand, solid dispersions due to the evolved interactions of their reactive groups with Fluvastatin provide a sufficient physical and chemical stability. The extent of interactions seems to play the most important role in the drug stabilization.",

For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on by the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to lower than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic and/or systolic hypertension include angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in patients who are not black), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as the initial treatment of hypertension if the systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above the target or if the diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above the target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include long- acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies.

An expanding pool of knowledge regarding the mechanism of aortic stenosis has led to the testing of statins to reduce the progression of aortic stenosis. Reviews, randomized, controlled trials and other studies pertaining to the topic were searched for using Medline, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect. Search terms used were \"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors\" and \"aortic stenosis.\" Studies found were then searched for relevant data and ranked using a rating system to determine the validity and quality of the study's results by evaluating the methodology used to include patients, clinical end points examined, and the methodology used to analyze data. Hand searches for referenced studies were also carried out. Studies with relevant results of acceptable quality were then incorporated. Statins have been found to be generally ineffective in delaying the progression of aortic stenosis, although some cohort studies found improvements in valve hemodynamics. Aortic stenosis lesions are characterized by calcific and lipoproteinacous deposits and end-stage aortic stenosis results in valve ossification. Although retrospective and prospective cohort studies show that statins do delay progression of aortic stenosis and improve hemodynamics of the affected valve, randomized, controlled study data do not reinforce these findings. Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS), a large randomized, controlled trial, not only found that statins have no significant effect on progression of aortic stenosis, but that statin therapy in those with aortic stenosis may lead to a higher incidence of cancer.",

However, the recent 4D and CORONA trials show no improvement in mortality in elderly patients with ischaemic heart failure and patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease receiving haemodialysis with the onset of statin treatment. The survival benefit from statin treatment appears to stem primarily from the prevention of progression of coronary artery disease. In clinical conditions where coronary artery disease does not significantly contribute to the cause of death statins seem to be less effective. In patients at risk for organ damage, statin treatment, therefore, has to be started early in the course of the disease. The effect of statin withdrawal in ischaemic heart failure or in patients with advanced renal disease is not known. On the basis of the available evidence, current statin treatment should not be stopped in these patients.",

However, such approaches lead to a new range of methodological and theoretical challenges pre-eminent among which are how to appropriately relate predictors of individual's behaviour to measures of the behaviour of healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the theory of planned behaviour proximal predictors of behaviour (intention and perceived behavioural control, or PBC) and practice level behaviour. This was done in the context of two clinical behaviours - statin prescription and foot examination - in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus in primary care. Scores for the predictor variables were aggregated over healthcare professionals using four methods: simple mean of all primary care team members' intention scores; highest intention score combined with PBC of the highest intender in the team; highest intention score combined with the highest PBC score in the team; the scores (on both constructs) of the team member identified as having primary responsibility for the clinical behaviour.",

    "142": "These approaches to aggregating individually-administered measures may be a methodological advance of theoretical importance. Using simple means of individual-level measures to explain team-level behaviours is neither theoretically plausible nor empirically supported; the highest intention was both predictive and plausible. In studies aiming to understand the behaviours of teams of healthcare professionals in managing chronic diseases, some sort of aggregation of measures from individuals is necessary. This is not simply a methodological point, but a necessary step in advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of the processes that lead to implementation of clinical behaviours within healthcare teams.", 
    "143": "A prospective epidemiological study was conducted to evaluate the incidence of febrile cough episodes among adult Muslims travelling from Marseille to Saudi Arabia during the Hajj pilgrimage and to assess if use of statin had an influence on this incidence. In total, 580 individuals were presented with a questionnaire. A significant proportion of individuals had chronic medical disorders, e.g. diabetes mellitus (132, 22.8%) and hypertension (147, 25.3%). Pilgrims had a low level of education and a low employment rate. Sixty (10.3%) were treated with statins for hypercholesterolemia. Four hundred and fourty-seven pilgrims were presented a questionnaire on returning home. A total of 74 travellers (16.6%) experienced fever during their stay in Saudi Arabia (67 attended a doctor) and 271 (60.6%) had cough (259 attended a doctor); 70 travellers with cough were febrile (25.9%). Seventy per cent of the travellers who suffered cough episodes developed their first symptoms within 3 days, suggesting a human to human transmission of the responsible pathogen, with short incubation time as evidenced by a bimodal distribution of cough in two peaks at a 24 h interval. None of demographical and socioeconomic characteristics, underlying diseases or vaccination against influenza significantly affected the occurrence of cough. Diabetes correlated with an increased risk of febrile cough (OR = 2.02 (1.05-3.89)) as well as unemployment (OR = 2.22 (0.91-5.53)). Use of statins had no significant influence on the occurrence of cough and/or fever during the pilgrimage. This result suggests that while treatment with a statin has been demonstrated to reduce the mortality from severe sepsis associated with respiratory tract infections, it probably does not play a role in the outcome of regular febrile cough episodes as observed in the cohort studied here.",

A total of 22 studies were retrieved, which included 177,260 people and compared clinical outcomes between 51,193 statin users and 126,067 non-statin users. Nineteen were cohort studies (seven prospective and 12 retrospective), two were retrospective case-control studies, and one was a randomized controlled study. Nine studies examined the use of statins in sepsis, four in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), three in bacteraemia, and three in post-operative patients. Mortality data were presented in 15 studies; in ten, mortality was lower among statin users (three of six sepsis studies, five of six CAP studies, and two of three bacteraemia studies). In four studies, there was no difference in mortality (two of six sepsis studies, one of six CAP studies, and one of three bacteraemia studies) and in one study there was increased mortality among septic intensive-care unit patients receiving statins. Five of the nine studies that examined the risk of developing sepsis/infection as a primary outcome (six of nine sepsis studies and all studies in the postoperative setting) found a decreased risk among statin users, whereas the remaining studies found no difference. Irrespective of their design (matched vs. non-matched), the majority of the studies suggested that statins have a beneficial effect on the outcome of infection; however, their observational design does not allow us to draw firm conclusions.

However, it is still unclear whether the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin has additive beneficial effects on the regression of advanced cardiac hypertrophy in hypertension. In the present study, the effects of the drug combination on advanced cardiac hypertrophy were investigated in elderly spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 2. Elderly SHR (36 weeks old) were randomly allocated into four groups of 12: (i) a vehicle-treated control group; (ii) an amlodipine (10 mg/kg per day)-treated group; (iii) an atorvastatin (10 mg/kg per day)-treated group; and (iv) a group treated with a combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin (both at 10 mg/kg per day). Drugs were administered by oral gavage every morning for a period of 12 weeks before hearts were harvested for analysis. 3. Combined administration of amlodipine and atorvastatin significantly suppressed cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis and upregulation of hypertrophic and profibrotic genes, and also improved left ventricular diastolic dysfunction to a greater extent than did amlodipine monotherapy. Further beneficial effects of combination therapy on advanced cardiac hypertrophy were associated with a greater reduction of NADPH oxidase-mediated increases in cardiac reactive oxygen species (ROS), rather than decreased blood pressure and serum cholesterol levels. 4. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined cardiovascular NADPH oxidase subunits and found that amlodipine clearly attenuated the expression of p47(phox) and p40(phox) and slightly but significantly reduced p22(phox) and Rac-1 levels in heart tissue. Combination treatment with amlodipine plus atorvastatin led to a further reduction in p22(phox), p47(phox) and Rac-1 protein levels compared with amlodipine alone. 5. In conclusion, combined amlodipine and atorvastatin treatment has a greater beneficial effect on advanced cardiac hypertrophy compared with amlodipine monotherapy. The benefits are likely to be related to the additive effects of the drugs on the suppression of NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of statin treatment and the addition of exercise training on lipid profile, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and levels of CK and alanine transaminase. Thirty-one hypercholesterolemic and physically inactive subjects were randomly assigned to rosuvastatin (R) or rosuvastatin/exercise (RE) group. A third group of physically active hypercholesterolemic subjects served as an active control group (AC). The R and RE groups received rosuvastatin treatment (10 mg/d) for 20 weeks. From week 10 to week 20, the RE group also participated in a combined endurance and resistive exercise training program (3 d/wk). Lipid profile was determined for all subjects at week 0 (Pre), week 10 (Mid), and week 20 (Post). The CK and alanine transaminase levels were measured at the same time points in the RE and R groups and 48 hours after the first and fifth exercise bout in the RE group. Each RE subject was formally queried about muscle fatigue, soreness, and stiffness before each training session. Total, LDL, and oxLDL cholesterol was lower in the RE and R groups at Mid and Post time points when compared with Pre. Oxidized LDL was lower in the RE group compared with the R group at the Post time point. When treatment groups (R and RE) were combined, high-density lipoprotein levels were increased and triglycerides decreased across time. Creatine kinase increased in the RE group 48 hours after the first exercise bout, but returned to baseline levels 48 hours after the fifth exercise bout. Rosuvastatin treatment decreased total, LDL, and oxLDL cholesterol. The addition of an exercise training program resulted in a further decrease in oxLDL. There was no abnormal sustained increase in CK or reports of myalgia after the addition of exercise training to rosuvastatin treatment.", 
    "171": "The Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial enrolled 10,001 patients with coronary disease to treatment with atorvastatin, 80 or 10 mg/d, and observed them for a median of 4.9 years. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were 77 mg/dL in the 80-mg group and 101 mg/dL in the 10-mg group. The primary end point, a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infraction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and stroke, occurred in 10.9% of patients in the 10-mg and 8.7% of patients in the 80-mg group (P = .0002). In large subgroups of patients in TNT, specifically those with diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, or previous coronary bypass (CABG) surgery, the risk of an event was significantly higher than in patients without these features. The absolute risk reduction in the 80-mg group was greater in each of these subgroups than in other TNT patients. The rates of stroke and hospitalization for heart failure were significantly lower in the more aggressively treated patients. A total of 18,696 patients have taken 80 mg of atorvastatin in clinical trials, usually for 4 to 5 years, with an excellent safety record. Pharmacoeconomic studies indicate that treatment with the 80-mg dose instead of the 10-mg dose almost costs neutral in US TNT-like patients (additional cost $181 for 5 years). In summary, wider use of the 80-mg dose of atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease is safe, cost-effective, and provides an incremental reduction in coronary events.",

In this study, we have assessed the safety of RMR by conducting toxicological studies in albino rats. Acute and sub-chronic toxicity studies were conducted on both sexes of albino rats. Feeding acute doses of RMR at 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 g/kg body weight to rats did not cause any symptoms of toxicity or mortality. Similarly, dietary feeding of RMR at 2.0%, 4.0%, 8.0% and 12.0% level (w/w) for 14 weeks did not produce any significant changes in food intake or gain in body weight of the experimental rats compared to control rats. There were no significant differences in the relative weight of vital organs, hematological parameters, macroscopic and microscopic changes in vital organs and serum clinical enzyme levels between the experimental and control groups. Moreover, the rats fed with RMR showed a significant reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride levels in both serum and liver. The results showed that toxicity studies with RMR of M. purpureus did not cause any toxic effects in albino rats.", 
    "173": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used cholesterol-lowering agents that also possess anti-inflammatory activities. Cysteine-rich 61 (Cyr61) and CCL2 are potential osteolytic mediators in inflammatory bone diseases. The study assessed the effect of simvastatin on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- alpha)-induced synthesis of Cyr61 and CCL2 in MG-63 human osteoblastic cells. The therapeutic effect of simvastatin on rat apical periodontitis was also examined. The synthesis of Cyr61 in MG-63 was assessed by Western analysis. Expression of CCL2 was examined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The effect of simvastatin on induced rat periapical lesion was examined radiographically and immunohistochemically. Western blot showed that TNF-alpha stimulated Cyr61 synthesis in MG-63, whereas simvastatin attenuated this effect in a dose-dependent manner. Simvastatin also reduced the levels of TNF-alpha-induced CCL2, and exogenous Cyr61 restored the inhibitory effects. Radiography and histopathology revealed that the administration of simvastatin markedly diminished the severity of induced rat periapical lesions. The numbers of Cyr61-synthesizing osteoblasts and CD-68-positive macrophages were also decreased. Simvastatin suppresses the progression of apical periodontitis, possibly by diminishing Cyr61 expression in osteoblasts and, subsequently, macrophage chemotaxis into the lesions.", 
    "174": "Statins and coenzyme Q10 are both used as adjuncts in the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, respectively. And both have been variously shown to improve cardiac function in patients with CHF. The two agents interact in two ways; statins inhibit coenzyme Q10 synthesis through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, also shared by coenzyme Q10. Secondly, they both exhibit their antioxidant effects through activation of the enzyme superoxide dismutase, the rate limiting step in nitric oxide metabolism and main antioxidant mechanism of coenzyme Q10. We hypothesize that the interaction between statins and coenzyme Q10 is more than just a replacement, but a synergistic interaction on superoxide dismutase that could result in better cardiac function, improvement in patient symptoms, shortening of duration of hospital stay and improvement in patient quality of life.", 
    "175": "Simvastatin has been shown to ameliorate pulmonary hypertension by several mechanisms in experimental animal models. In this study, we hypothesized that the major benefits of simvastatin in pulmonary hypertension occur via the heme oxygenase-1 pathway.", 
    "176": "Simvastatin (10 mg/kgw/day) was tested in two rat models of pulmonary hypertension (PH): monocrotaline administration and chronic hypoxia. The hemodynamic changes, right heart hypertrophy, HO-1 protein expression, and heme oxygenase (HO) activity in lungs were measured in both models with and without simvastatin treatment. Tin-protoporphyrin (SnPP, 20 micromol/kg w/day), a potent inhibitor of HO activity, was used to confirm the role of HO-1.", 
    "177": "Simvastatin significantly ameliorated pulmonary arterial hypertension from 38.0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg to 22.1 +/- 1.9 mm Hg in monocrotaline-induced PH (MCT-PH) and from 33.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg to 17.5 +/- 2.9 mm Hg in chronic hypoxia-induced PH (CH-PH) rats. The severity of right ventricular hypertrophy was significantly reduced by simvastatin in MCT-PH and CH-PH rats. Co-administration with SnPP abolished the benefits of simvastatin. Simvastatin significantly increased HO-1 protein expression and HO activity in the lungs of rats with PH; however co-administration of SnPP reduced HO-1 activity only. These observations indicate that the simvastatin-induced amelioration of pulmonary hypertension was directly related to the activity of HO-1, rather than its expression.",

    "179": "This study is to investigate the effects of fluvastatin on the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB1) in glomerular mesangial cells under high concentration of glucose. High concentration glucose and fluvastatin were used to stimulate the cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells (GMCs) in vitro. The protein expressions of p38 MAPK, CREB1, p-p38 MAPK and p-CREB1 were observed with Western blotting. TGF-beta1 and fibronectin (FN) mRNA were measured with reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein synthesis of laminine (LN) and type IV collagen in the supernatants of the GMCs were detected with radioimmunoassay. Compared with low glucose control group, the expressions of p-p38 MAPK, p-CREB1 were increased obviously in high glucose group, TGF-beta1 mRNA and FN mRNA, LN and type IV collagen in the supernatants were increased significantly in GMCs under high concentration glucose medium. The expression levels of p-p38 MAPK, p-CREB1, TGF-beta1 mRNA, and FN mRNA, LN and type IV collagen in the supernatants were significantly lower in the fluvastatin group than those in the high concentration glucose group. It is concluded that fluvastatin can inhibit over production of TGF-beta1 and ECM proteins in GMCs under high concentration of glucose, partly by regulating the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and CREB1.",

BP was reduced by 20.4/10.7 and 21.8/12.6 mmHg in JEWEL 1 and JEWEL 2, respectively, and reductions in LDL-C were 0.90 mmol/l (34.8 mg/dl) and 1.09 mmol/l (42.2 mg/dl), respectively. The most common adverse events were peripheral oedema (11.0%), joint swelling (2.9%) and headache (2.9%), of which, only oedema was linked to study treatment.",

    "189": "Increasing evidence indicates that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex disease involving more than airflow obstruction. Airflow obstruction has profound effects on cardiac function and gas exchange with systemic consequences. In addition, as COPD results from inflammation and/or alterations in repair mechanisms, the \"spill-over\" of inflammatory mediators into the circulation may result in important systemic manifestations of the disease, such as skeletal muscle wasting and cachexia. Systemic inflammation may also initiate or worsen comorbid diseases, such as ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, osteoporosis, normocytic anaemia, lung cancer, depression and diabetes. Comorbid diseases potentiate the morbidity of COPD, leading to increased hospitalisations, mortality and healthcare costs. Comorbidities complicate the management of COPD and need to be evaluated carefully. Current therapies for comorbid diseases, such as statins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-agonists, may provide unexpected benefits for COPD patients. Treatment of COPD inflammation may concomitantly treat systemic inflammation and associated comorbidities. However, new broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory treatments, such as phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, have significant side-effects so it may be necessary to develop inhaled drugs in the future. Another approach is the reversal of corticosteroid resistance, for example with effective antioxidants. More research is needed on COPD comorbidities and their treatment.", 
    "190": "Statins are lipid-lowering drugs widely used in the management of vascular diseases. Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that statins improve endothelial function by both cholesterol-lowering-dependent and -independent mechanisms. We have previously shown that endothelial dysfunction induced by risk factors and proinflammatory cytokines is associated with down-regulation of lysyl oxidase (LOX), a key enzyme modulating extracellular matrix maturation and vascular integrity. Our aim was to analyse whether statins could normalize LOX expression impaired by proatherogenic risk factors.", 
    "191": "We observed that pharmacological concentrations of statins (atorvastatin and simvastatin) modulated LOX transcriptional activity, counteracting the down-regulation of LOX (at the mRNA, protein, and activity level) caused by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in porcine, bovine, and human aortic endothelial cells. Geranylgeraniol but not farnesol reversed this effect, suggesting the involvement of geranylgeranylated proteins. In accordance, inhibitors of RhoA/Rho kinase also counteracted LOX down-regulation caused by TNFalpha, and over-expression of a RhoA dominant-negative mutant mimicked statin effects. Statins were also able to counteract the decrease in LOX expression produced by atherogenic concentrations of LDL by a similar mechanism and to partially prevent the increase in endothelial permeability elicited by these lipoproteins. Finally, in the in vivo porcine model of hypercholesterolaemia, we observed that statins abrogated the reduction of vascular LOX expression triggered by high plasma levels of LDL.", 
    "192": "These data indicate that statins normalize vascular LOX expression altered by atherogenic risk factors through a RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent mechanism. Thus, modulation of LOX by statins could contribute to vascular protection and to the cardiovascular risk reduction achieved by this therapy.", 
    "193": "Statins are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia but can lead to a number of side effects in muscle, including rhabdomyolysis. Our recent findings implicated the induction of atrogin-1, a gene required for the development of muscle atrophy, in statin-induced muscle damage. Since statins inhibit many biochemical reactions besides cholesterol synthesis, we sought to define the statin-inhibited pathways responsible for atrogin-1 expression and muscle damage. We report here that lovastatin-induced atrogin-1 expression and muscle damage in cultured mouse myotubes and zebrafish can be prevented in the presence of geranylgeranol but not farnesol. Further, inhibitors of the transfer of geranylgeranyl isoprene units to protein targets cause statin muscle damage and atrogin-1 induction in cultured cells and in fish. These findings support the concept that dysfunction of small GTP-binding proteins lead to statin-induced muscle damage since these molecules require modification by geranylgeranyl moieties for their cellular localization and activity. Collectively, our animal and in vitro findings shed light on the molecular mechanism of statin-induced myopathy and suggest that atrogin-1 may be regulated by novel signaling pathways.",

Aortic valve area (AVA) was measured using the continuity equation. CAS severity was categorized using AVA. D and non-D patients were compared for differences in sex, hypertension, smoking, statin use using chi(2) tests. Comparisons between D and non-D for changes in AVA per year were performed using ANOVA. Study cohort included 166 males with age 70 +/- 9 years, of which 72 (43%) had D. Baseline CAS was mild in 66 subjects, moderate in 75, and severe in 25. D subjects smoked less (P = 0.02), but all other variables were similar (P > 0.05). The interaction between D and baseline CAS severity was significant (P = 0.0191), indicating comparisons should be viewed by baseline CAS severity. D had significantly larger change in AVA than non-D (P = 0.0016) for those with moderate CAS at baseline only. Adjusting for statin use did not alter the results.",

A recent experimental study identified c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) as a proximal signaling molecule in the pathogenesis of AAA and vascular dendritic cells as key players in the inflammatory reaction and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Statins can inhibit cell proliferation and vascular inflammation, which might help prevent AAA progression. However, supporting clinical data from human studies are lacking. We hypothesized that atorvastatin might inhibit JNK and dendritic cells, resulting in suppression of inflammatory cells and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in human tissue of AAA.",

    "201": "We tested the hypothesis that, in adults with essential hypertension, plasma levels of midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) are associated with target organ damage. MR-proANP is a newly described stable fragment of N-terminal proatrial natriuretic peptide. Participants included 1,919 adults with hypertension identified from the community (1,037 African-Americans, 65 +/- 9 years of age, 72% women; 882 non-Hispanic whites, 61 +/- 9 years of age, 55% women). We measured MR-proANP by an immunoluminometric assay. Measurements of target organ damage included the ankle-brachial index (ABI), urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR), and left ventricular (LV) mass (available only in African-Americans). Generalized estimating equations were used to assess whether plasma MR-proANP was associated with measurements of target organ damage, independent of potential confounding variables. In African-Americans, higher MR-proANP was significantly associated with lower ABI (p <0.0001), higher UACR (p <0.0001), and greater LV mass (indexed to height to the power of 2.7, p <0.0001). After adjustment for age, gender, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, estimated glomerular filtration rate, smoking history, diabetes mellitus, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterols, medication (blood pressure lowering, statin, and aspirin) use, and previous myocardial infarction or stroke, higher MR-proANP levels remained significantly associated with lower ABI (p = 0.01), higher UACR (p = 0.0007), and greater LV mass index (p <0.0001). In non-Hispanic whites, higher MR-proANP levels were significantly associated with lower ABI (p = 0.002) and greater UACR (p = 0.001), but not after adjustment for the covariates listed earlier. In conclusion, plasma MR-proANP may be a marker of target organ damage in the setting of hypertension, especially in African-Americans.", 
    "202": "Stroke recurrence continues to be the major risk for stroke survivors. Risk factor control and antithrombotic medication are two major strategies for patients with a prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) to prevent stroke recurrence. Hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes mellitus are risk factors that are modifiable by pharmacotherapy, as well as by lifestyle modification. Antihypertensive treatment is recommended for secondary stroke prevention for both hypertensive and normotensive patients. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy to obtain an intensive lipid-lowering effect is also highly recommended. A recent trial indicated that treatment with pioglitazone is effective for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the evidence for risk factor control is relatively new, and further studies are needed for better evidence-based prevention. For patients with noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke or TIA, antiplatelet therapy rather than anticoagulation is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events. Aspirin was the first antiplatelet agent to have established evidence for secondary stroke prevention. Currently, aspirin monotherapy, the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole, and clopidogrel monotherapy are recommended as the major choices. The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is not routinely recommended. Adjusted-dose warfarin with a target international normalized ratio range between 2.0 and 3.0 is recommended after an ischaemic stroke or TIA associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Bleeding complications are a critical problem with antithrombotic therapy. Warfarin, as well as antiplatelet therapy, increases the incidence of bleeding and worsens the severity of the bleeding events. Choosing antithrombotic agents and their intensity (dosage) appropriate to the stroke mechanism and the patient's condition are essential for secondary stroke prevention.", 
    "203": "We evaluated the effects of 2 commonly available strategies (plant stanol ester drink and 10 mg simvastatin) on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk variables in participants with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome patients are at increased risk to develop CHD, partly due to high triacylglycerol (TAG) and low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations and a low-grade inflammatory profile. Effects of plant stanol esters on TAG concentrations in these participants are unknown. After a 3-wk run-in period in which individuals consumed placebo yogurt drinks and placebo capsules, participants were randomly divided into 4 groups: placebo (n = 9), simvastatin + placebo drink (n = 10), placebo + stanol drink (n = 9), and simvastatin + stanol drink (n = 8). After 9 wk, we evaluated the effects on serum lipids, low-grade inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction markers. In metabolic syndrome patients, stanol esters (2.0 g/d), simvastatin, or the combination lowered non-HDL-C by 12.8% (P = 0.011), 30.7% (P < 0.001), and 35.4% (P < 0.001), respectively, compared with placebo. TAG were lowered by 27.5% (P = 0.044), 21.7% (P = 0.034), and 32.7% (P < 0.01), respectively. The total-:HDL-C ratio was significantly lowered in all 3 intervention groups. We found no treatment effects on the apolipoprotein CII:CIII ratio, cholesterol ester transfer protein mass, FFA concentrations, and markers for low-grade inflammation or endothelial dysfunction. This study shows that in metabolic syndrome patients, plant stanol esters lower not only non-HDL-C, but also TAG. Effects on TAG were also present in combination with statin treatment, illustrating an additional benefit of stanol esters in this CHD risk population.", 
    "204": "The link between cholesterol and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is indicated by genetic, epidemiological, experimental and clinical evidence, although the relationship is far from simple or straightforward. Compared with extracerebral cholesterol, little is known about brain cholesterol homeostasis. In addition, current diagnostic criteria for AD exclude a priori the pathogenic participation of vascular factors (to which cholesterol is traditionally associated), and require modifications. Randomized controlled trials suggest that the dementia stage of AD may already be too late for significant benefits of statin therapy, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment. Cholesterol-modifying strategies may be more effective in dementia/AD prevention. Since cholesterol is only one piece of the dementia/AD puzzle, integrative interventions (lifestyle-related and, when necessary, pharmacologic) focusing on overall risk instead of individual risk factors may bring more benefit to individuals at risk.",
