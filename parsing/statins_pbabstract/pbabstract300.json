To search for markers of atherosclerosis, we compared the in vivo transcriptomes of monocytes purified from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and normal subjects by using the serial analysis of gene expression technique. We selected a subset of differentially expressed monocyte-specific genes and confirmed their expression levels. The Finkel-Biskis-Jinkins osteosarcoma (FOS) gene was significantly increased in patients, and the highest levels of FOS associated with patients who had previously undergone coronary revascularization. The correlation between coronary revascularization and FOS was higher than that compared with the cardiac risk marker high sensitivity C-reactive protein. In vitro inhibition of FOS using small interfering RNA and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (statin) affected monocyte activation and suggested an important role in pathogenesis. Given the prominent role of FOS in inflammation and calcification, its association with atherosclerosis severity has clear pathophysiologic bases as well as clinical implications as a marker. Our results suggest that analysis of gene expression in circulating cells may provide biological and clinical insights into human atherosclerosis, and that this type of approach may be applicable for studying other types of diseases.", 
    "1": "Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The prevalence of hyperlipidaemia or dyslipidaemias is much higher compared to the general population. Total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is highest in patients with chronic renal impairment. The majority of patients with CKD do not develop renal failure; indeed, most of them die of cardiovascular causes before the development of renal failure. The K/DOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines on dyslipidaemias in CKD suggest that all patients should therefore be evaluated for dyslipidaemias. They should have a complete fasting lipid profile with total, LDL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides measured to identify those at risk and those who require treatment. Generally, the treatment approach parallels that suggested by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, in which the main focus of treatment is the level of LDL cholesterol. Patients with CKD should be considered a \"very high risk\" category and aggressive therapeutic intervention initiated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.", 
    "2": "We investigated the potential role of atorvastatin, given at reperfusion, to improve survival of the ischemic/reperfused myocardium by activation of p44/42 MAPK and p38 MAPK with its downstream effector, HSP27. We have previously shown that atorvastatin attenuates lethal reperfusion-induced injury via activation of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) prosurvival signaling pathway. In this study we hypothesize that other prosurvival kinases may also be implicated in this protection. Langendorff-perfused mouse hearts were subjected to 35 minutes of global ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion, and either infarct size or the levels of phosphorylated AKT, p44/42 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and HSP27 were analyzed. Atorvastatin was administered during reperfusion only. We used wortmannin to block PI3K/AKT, U0126 to block p44/42 MAPK, and SB203580 to prevent the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and HSP27. Atorvastatin significantly reduced infarct size (32.96 +/- 3.4% versus 51.27 +/- 2.79% in controls, P < 0.05). This protection was abrogated by wortmannin (48.38 +/- 4.28%), U0126 (52.58 +/- 7.58), and SB203580 (49.37 +/- 4.16%). Western blot analysis confirmed significant phosphorylation of AKT, p44/42 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and HSP27 following administration of atorvastatin during reperfusion and abrogation of the respective phosphorylation in the presence of their specific inhibitors. Atorvastatin given at reperfusion attenuates lethal reperfusion-induced injury by the phosphorylation of multiple prosurvival pathways involving not only PI3K/AKT but also p44/42 MAPK, p38 MAPK, and HSP27.", 
    "3": "This study compared the effects of fluvastatin and pravastatin on the in vivo oxidation of LDL in a crossover design to evaluate whether or not it is justified to switch between the two statins with regard to serum levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins (apo), and circulating autoantibodies to oxidized LDL (OxLDL-Ab). Patients with hypercholesterolemia (n = 46) were randomly assigned into groups who received fluvastatin (20 mg/d) or pravastatin (10 mg/d). After 3 months, they were crossed to receive the other statin for another 3 months. Circulating levels of OxLDL-Ab were measured by an OxLDL IgG ELISA test. Fluvastatin and pravastatin similarly decreased serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and apo B, and increased HDL(2)-C levels. After crossover to the other statin, these lipid parameters were not further changed by either statin. Before crossover, circulating levels of OxLDL-Ab were decreased in patients with fluvastatin treatment, but not in those with pravastatin treatment. After switching from the other statin, both fluvastatin and pravastatin further decreased OxLDL-Ab levels. In conclusion, fluvastatin at 20 mg/d and pravastatin at 10 mg/d are similar with regard to their efficacy in decreasing TC, LDL-C, and apo B levels and increasing HDL(2)-C levels. Fluvastatin lowered circulating levels of OxLDL-Ab, and these effects continued after switching to pravastatin.",

As the prevalence of diabetes increases significantly worldwide, greater attention must be focused on preventing cardiovascular events in this group. One contributor to this increased event rate is the characteristic pattern of dyslipidemia in diabetic patients, consisting of elevated serum triglyceride levels, decreased high-density lipoprotein levels, and an increased proportion of small, dense, low-density lipoproteins. Several pharmacologic agents have been used to treat this dyslipidemia including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fibric acid derivatives, niacin (nicotinic acid), thiazolidinediones, and fish oils, as well as other non-pharmacologic measures. Currently, the most extensive data for a reduction in cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes exist for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The results of these trials indicate that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy should be considered for all patients with diabetes at sufficient risk for cardiovascular events, regardless of serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level. Several ongoing trials of various pharmacologic agents should help clarify the role of these agents alone and in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the management of diabetic dyslipidemia.",

Epidemiological as well as experimental studies suggest that inflammatory process induced and intensified by common atherosclerosis risk factors as age, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, male sex and smoking, is responsible for these changes. Microscopic examination of the affected valves reveals: endothelium derangement, thickening of the subendothelial layer, intra- and extracellular lipid, lipoprotein and protein deposits, inflammatory infiltrate composed of macrophages, T lymphocytes, foam cells and intensive calcification in the zones of lipid accumulation. The method of choice in the assessment of aortic valve stenosis is echocardiography. New, more sensitive, quantitative radiological methods like Electron Beam Computed Tomography and Multislice Computed Tomography may be useful in a detection of early lesions and monitoring of their progress. As the process of aortic valve degeneration is long and progressive in nature, early introduction of effective prevention would decrease the number of patients operated on for aortic stenosis. A number of studies indicate the role of statins in slowing the progression of aortic valve degeneration. Nevertheless, no large randomized prospective study has emerged in this field and there is no strong enough evidence for the efficacy of statins in degenerative aortic valve disease.",

Studies consistently report that the majority of CAD patients do not achieve NCEP goals in clinical practice; we sought to determine if our practice fared better. We performed a retrospective chart review of 600 CAD patients followed by cardiologists. The mean age was 69, and 66% of patients were male. Of persons with a cardiology clinic lipid profile (60%), most (76%) achieved an LDL-C <100 mg/dL; however, only 61% were treated to the NCEP secondary goal of non-HDL-C <130 mg/dL. Of patients not at an LDL-C goal, 81% were on lipid-lowering therapy, but only 18% were on maximal statin doses and 6% on combination therapy. We concluded that the majority of CAD patients have had recent lipid measurements and are treated according to NCEP guidelines, but many patients remain on suboptimal therapy.",

A parallel 96 capillary instrument analyzed 900 samples in 8 h. with a 100 mM MES at pH 5.2 running buffer. In this manner, the fermentation broths of thousands of mutated strains were efficiently and inexpensively screened for increased lovastatin production.

During 1-year clinical follow-up, simvastatin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (1.9% vs 7.5%, p = 0.048), restenosis rate (25.7% vs 43.1%, p = 0.033), and repeat PCI rate (25.7% vs 43.1%, p = 0.033), and with significant improvement in LV ejection fraction (31% to 42% vs 32% to 39%, p = 0.042). The event-free survival rate was higher in group I than in group II (79.8% vs 57.0%, p = 0.001).

However, statin therapy reduces plasma levels of coenzyme Q(10) (ubiquinone), which may have adverse effects on heart failure states. We hypothesized that atorvastatin treatment improves endothelial function in patients with chronic heart failure independent of LDL-cholesterol alterations. Furthermore, we assessed how reductions in coenzyme Q(10) levels impact on potentially improved endothelial function. Twenty-four patients with stable, symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association Class II or III) and a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% were randomised to 40 mg atorvastatin or placebo for 6 weeks and crossed over to the other treatment arm for a further 6 weeks, after a 2-week wash out. Forearm resistance vessel function was assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography during infusion of acetylcholine (ACh), sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) into the brachial artery. Atorvastatin treatment lowered triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and coenzyme Q(10) levels (all p<0.001) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation during acetylcholine infusion (p=0.015). Endothelium-dependent forearm blood flow improvements correlated with reductions in coenzyme Q(10) levels (p=0.011), but not with LDL-cholesterol levels (p=0.084). Coenzyme Q(10) remained the significant variable predicting improvement in NO dependent endothelial function after adjusting for LDL-cholesterol levels (p=0.041). In conclusion, short-term atorvastatin therapy improved endothelial function in chronic heart failure patients. Further studies are required to determine whether coenzyme Q(10) reductions are limiting the maximum favourable effects of statin therapy on the microcirculation.",

    "29": "Hepatic lipase (HL) not only plays an important role in plasma lipoprotein transport, but may also affect intracellular lipid metabolism. We hypothesize that HL expression is regulated as an integral part of intracellular lipid homeostasis. Addition of oleate (1 mM) to HepG2 cells increased HL secretion to 134+/-14% of control (p<0.02), and increased the transcriptional activity of a 698-bp HL promoter-reporter construct two-fold. Atorvastatin (10 microM) abolished the oleate stimulation. The transcriptional activity of a sterol-regulatory-element binding protein (SREBP)-sensitive HMG-CoA synthase promoter construct was reduced 50% by oleate, and increased 2-3-fold by atorvastatin. Co-transfection with an SREBP-2 expression vector reduced HL promoter activity and increased HMG-CoA synthase promoter activity. Upstream stimulatory factors (USF) are also implicated in maintenance of lipid homeostasis. Co-transfection with a USF-1 expression vector stimulated HL promoter activity 4-6-fold. The USF-stimulated HL promoter activity was not further enhanced by oleate, but almost completely prevented by atorvastatin or co-transfection with the SREBP-2 vector. Opposite regulation by USF-1 and SREBP-2 was also observed with a 318-bp HL promoter construct that lacks potential SRE-like and E-box binding motifs. We conclude that the opposite regulation of HL expression by fatty acids and statins is mediated via SREBP, possibly through interaction with USF.", 
    "30": "Cell adhesion molecules P-selectin, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. High levels of nitric oxide (NO) produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) have been associated with atherosclerotic processes. Simvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor responsible for many clinical benefits. The aim of this study was to detect and quantify changes in endothelial expression of P-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and iNOS in the vessel wall after the shortterm administration of simvastatin in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis. Eighteen New Zealand White rabbits were randomly divided into three groups (n=6). In the cholesterol group, rabbits consumed an atherogenic diet (0.4% cholesterol) for eight weeks. In the simvastatin group, rabbits consumed an atherogenic diet for six weeks and then consumed an atherogenic diet supplemented with simvastatin (10 mg kg(-1)) for two weeks. Biochemical analysis showed that administration of simvastatin led to an almost two-fold lowering of the total serum cholesterol, VLDL, LDL and HDL, but not triglycerides, compared with the cholesterol-fed rabbits only. Stereological analysis of the immunohistochemical staining revealed that administration of simvastatin (10 mg kg(-1) daily) in an atherogenic diet decreased the endothelial expression of P-selectin, ICAM-1 and iNOS in both aortic arch and carotid artery compared with the cholesterol fed-rabbits only. We conclude that simvastatin has beneficial effects on endothelial function by decreasing expression of P-selectin, ICAM-1 and iNOS in endothelial cells in the very early stages of atherogenesis.", 
    "31": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction and stroke. It follows that PAD merits aggressive preventive treatment that includes lipid lowering drugs (mainly statins). This review summarises the current knowledge concerning the use and mechanisms of action of statins in patients with PAD. Statins not only lower the risk of vascular events, but they also improve the symptoms associated with PAD. There is also evidence that statins reduce surgical mortality and improve graft patency and limb salvage. Because of the high risk, a more aggressive goal [i.e. low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 70 mg/dl; 1.8 mmol/l] [National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III), revised guidelines 2004] should be considered to maximally reduce the atheroma burden and related events. Not all statins can achieve this LDL-C target. Furthermore, there may be a need to use an additional lipid lowering drug so as to achieve the LDL-C goal and benefit from the different modes of action. Statins exert beneficial pleiotropic effects on haemostasis, the vasculature and inflammatory markers. There is also evidence that statins improve renal function (the plasma creatinine level is considered as an emerging vascular risk factor). Since PAD patients often take several drugs, there is a need to carefully consider their selection so as to maximize benefits and minimize adverse effects. Patients with PAD often do not receive adequate lipid lowering treatment. This situation needs to change.",

    "40": "The use of statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors that block the synthesis of mevalonate (and downstream products such as cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids), as a therapy for Alzheimer disease is currently the subject of intense debate. It has been reported that statins reduce the risk of developing the disorder, and a link between cholesterol and Alzheimer disease pathophysiology has been proposed. Moreover, experimental studies focusing on the cholesterol-dependent effects of statins have demonstrated a close association between cellular cholesterol levels and amyloid production. However, evidence suggests that statins are pleiotropic, and the potential cholesterol-independent effects of statins on amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) genesis are unknown. In this study, we developed a novel in vitro system that enabled the discrete analysis of cholesterol-dependent and -independent (i.e. isoprenoid-dependent) statin effects on APP cleavage and A beta formation. Given the recent interest in the role that intracellular A beta may play in Alzheimer disease, we analyzed statin effects on both secreted and cell-associated A beta. As reported previously, low cellular cholesterol levels favored the alpha-secretase pathway and decreased A beta secretion presumably within the endocytic pathway. In contrast, low isoprenoid levels resulted in the accumulation of APP, amyloidogenic fragments, and A beta likely within biosynthetic compartments. Importantly, low cholesterol and low isoprenoid levels appeared to have completely independent effects on APP metabolism and A beta formation. Although the implications of these effects for Alzheimer disease pathophysiology have yet to be investigated, to our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence that isoprenylation is involved in determining levels of intracellular A beta.",

Most participants (70%) stated that they had been using statins to decrease cholesterol, whereas 16.5% stated that they had no idea. More than half of the participants (58%) stated that they did not know how long they would have to keep using their statins, whereas 21% replied that they would use them continuously. One fifth of participants had some idea about side effects. Participants in whom statin therapy was started during hospitalisation for coronary angiography and/or PCI more frequently answered that statins should be used continuously (49% vs. 12% not hospitalised, p < 0.01). Also, therapy adjustment by the physician led to a better understanding of the need for continuous use (55% vs. 31% without medication change, p < 0.001), as was the case for patients with < 2 co-medications (36% vs. 17% with > 2 co-medications, p 0.002).

The Heart Protection Study was designed to resolve these uncertainties and to provide substantially more safety information of statins. In this report the study is presented with the significance and practical implications of the results briefly discussed.", 
    "65": "Previous studies have shown that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) protect the brain against ischemic injury by upregulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Here, we tested the hypothesis that statins provide additional beneficial effects by also upregulating endogenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and enhancing clot lysis in a mouse model of embolic focal ischemia. Heterologous blood clots (0.2 mm) were injected into the distal internal carotid artery to occlude blood flow in the middle cerebral artery territory after long-term (14 days) simvastatin, atorvastatin or vehicle treatment. Ischemic lesion volume, neurologic deficits, as well as residual blood clots were measured at 22 h. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assessed mRNA levels of eNOS, tPA, and the endogenous plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1. Ischemic lesion volumes and neurologic deficits were significantly reduced in wild-type mice by both simvastatin and atorvastatin. Statins increased eNOS and tPA mRNA levels but did not change mRNA levels of PAI-1. In eNOS knockout mice, atorvastatin reduced the volume of ischemic tissue and improved neurologic outcomes after arterial occlusion by blood clot emboli. In contrast, statins did not have protective effects in tPA knockout mice after embolic focal ischemia, but only in a filament model where focal ischemia was achieved via mechanical occlusion. These results suggest that statins protect against stroke by multiple mechanisms involving both eNOS and tPA. The involvement of each pathway may be revealed depending on the choice of experimental stroke model.", 
    "66": "Cholesterol has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the underlying mechanisms are not yet clear, several studies have provided evidence for the involvement of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in the production of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), the major component of amyloid deposits in AD. In this regard, the gamma-secretase complex is responsible for the final cleavage event in the processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP), resulting in Abeta generation. The gamma-secretase complex is a multiprotein complex composed of presenilin, nicastrin (NCT), APH-1, and PEN-2. Recent reports have suggested that gamma-secretase activity is predominantly localized in lipid rafts, and presenilin and NCT have been reported to be localized in lipid rafts. In this study, various biochemical methods, including coimmunoprecipitation, in vitro gamma-secretase assay, and methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) treatment, are employed to demonstrate that all four components of the active endogenous gamma-secretase complex, including APH-1 and PEN-2, are associated with lipid rafts in human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Treatment with statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase inhibitors, significantly decreased the association of the gamma-secretase complex with lipid rafts without affecting the distribution of flotillin-1. This effect was partially abrogated by the addition of geranylgeraniol. These results suggest that both cholesterol and protein isoprenylation influence the active gamma-secretase complex association with lipid rafts.", 
    "67": "We previously demonstrated that cholesterol deprivation increases endothelial cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent prostacyclin [prostaglandin I2 (PGI2)] production in vitro. Cholesterol directly regulates gene transcription through the sterol response element binding protein (SREBP). In this work, we demonstrate that SREBP directly regulates COX-2 expression. Cholesterol reduces human COX-2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct activity in transiently transfected endothelial cells. Conversely, cotransfection with a constitutively active mutant SREBP increases COX-2 promoter activity. SREBP-1a and -2 specifically bind a putative sterol response element (SRE) sequence in the COX-2 promoter. This sequence competes for SREBP binding to a low density lipoprotein receptor consensus sequence in an electromobility-shift assay. These data indicate that endothelial COX-2 is regulated by cholesterol via the SREBP pathway. The present study identifies COX-2 as the first vascular gene without a clear role in lipid metabolism transactivated by SREBP, and suggests that enhanced production of PGI2 through this pathway may be an additional benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapies.",

Among the groups of patients in whom clopidogrel was used (groups II and IV), group II patients were older, more likely to have prior MI, but less likely to have a history of prior revascularization. In-hospital cardiac catheterization and revascularization rates were similar between groups II and IV. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 6 month mortality rate was lower in group IV (log-rank test 22.8, P<0.0001). The hazard ratio for the 6 month mortality rate was adjusted using the Cox proportional hazard model for confounding variables and for propensity score, and the 6 month mortality rate for patients in group IV remained lower compared with those in group II [0.59 (0.41-0.86), P<0.0001].",

The total expected cost per patient and the cost per inpatient event avoided were compared for patients on atorvastatin 80 mg daily versus placebo. The analysis was based on clinical outcome data from the MIRACL study. Clinical outcomes measured in this analysis included: death, cardiac arrest, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal MI, angina pectoris, stroke, congestive heart failure (CHF), and surgical or percutaneous coronary revascularizations. Unit costs for outcomes were values using 2001 Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) costs in Spain. The cost of a follow-up visit was added to the cost of each outcome in both groups. In the atorvastatin group, monitoring costs were also added. All direct medical costs were taken from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System during a 16-week period. The hospital cost in the atorvastatin group was <euro> 1,921 per patient, compared to <euro> 1,853 in the placebo group. The incremental cost per patient in the atorvastatin group was <euro> 67.47, corresponding to a cost per inpatient event avoided of <euro> 1,760. The cost of atorvastatin for 16 weeks was <euro> 128. Forty-seven percent of this cost of atorvastatin was offset by the cost savings obtained through the reduction of number of events in the atorvastatin group. In Spain, the intensive short-term use of atorvastatin in patients with ACS has a favorable cost-effectiveness. The direct cost of the drug was largely offset by the associated reduction in costs for treating fewer cardiovascular events.", 
    "75": "The pathophysiology of statin-mediated muscle dysfunction is poorly defined. Reductions in skeletal muscle membrane cholesterol were initially thought to account for the range of myopathic reactions, e.g., myalgia, elevated serum creatine kinase, or rhabdomyolysis. This assumption however, does not consider a potential role of the isoprenoids in the pathophysiology of statin myopathy. The observation that derangements in mevalonate kinase (MK), but not more distal enzymes of cholesterologenesis, are associated with a skeletal myopathy suggests a critical role for the isoprenoids in the maintenance of muscle. Statins also deplete the isoprenoid pool by inhibiting the enzyme, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, which is upstream of MK. Identifying candidate proteins that are both dependent on isoprenoid-mediated modification and associated with muscle disease, when genetically mutated, offers further insight into potential mechanisms of statin myopathy. For example, lamin A/C, selenoprotein N, alpha- and beta-dystroglycan, and cytoskeletal G-proteins all require isoprenylation for optimal function. Understanding the pleiotropic effects of protein prenylation, and the potential consequences of a generalized insufficiency of this form of protein modification, may help clarify the molecular pathogenesis of statin myopathy.",

On average, atorvastatin did not affect the ratio between the CYP3A4-mediated metabolite AM9 and cyclosporine, suggesting that atorvastatin does not affect the CYP3A4 metabolism of cyclosporine to any significant extent. However, the influence of atorvastatin on the ratio between AM9 and cyclosporine showed large interindividual variability.",

    "80": "The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) is associated with an increased risk of recurrent thrombosis and pregnancy loss. APLA are able to activate endothelial cells (EC) and induce an increase in the expression of inflammatory marker proteins, such as leukocyte adhesion molecules, tissue factor or the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Our objective was to investigate the effect of statins on EC activation induced by APLA in vitro. IgG was purified from the plasma of six patients with APLA and from healthy controls. EC were incubated with patient IgG or with control IgG, in the presence or absence of 5microM of fluvastatin, and expression of the leukocyte adhesion molecules, VCAM-1 and E-selectin, analyzed by flow cytometry and by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (QRT-PCR). The expression of tissue factor and the chemokine MCP-1 was analyzed by QRT-PCR alone. Incubation of EC with patient IgG increased the expression of VCAM-1, E-selectin, tissue factor and MCP-1. Prior treatment of the cells with fluvastatin further increased the expression of these proteins. The fluvastatin effect was reversed by co-incubation with mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate and mimicked by the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-286. Our results show that in cultured human EC, statins increase the extent of inflammatory activation induced by APLA. This effect appears to be mediated by an inhibitory effect of statins on one or more geranylgeranylated protein(s).", 
    "81": "This study aims to investigate whether or not long-term statin treatment causes upregulation of D1 and D2 receptor gene expression with concomitant increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in Sprague-Dawley rats. Serum triglyceride levels were dose dependently reduced in the simvastatin-treated rats reaching statistical significance at the highest dose (49% reduction), while pravastatin caused similar effects (52%) at the same dose. Cholesterol levels remained unchanged in both groups at all doses. Simvastatin, 10 or 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1), increased D1 and D2 receptor expressions in the prefrontal cortex. Similar upregulation was observed neither with simvastatin in the striatum nor with pravastatin in both brain regions. Simvastatin (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) also increased eNOS expression in the prefrontal cortex but not neuronal NOS or inducible NOS. D1 receptor activation by chloro-APB (5 microM) increased cAMP levels in synaptosomes prepared from the prefrontal cortex of control and simvastatin-treated rats by 88 and 285%, respectively. This effect was markedly attenuated by the selective D1 antagonist SCH-23390 (25 microM). D2 receptor activation by quinpirole (5 microM) had no effect on the basal cAMP levels in synaptosomes prepared from the prefrontal cortex of control and simvastatin-treated rats, while the same concentration of quinpirole completely abolished the D1 receptor-mediated increase. These results suggest that lipophilic statins can alter dopaminergic functions in the prefrontal cortex possibly via a central mechanism. The possibility of a nitric oxide mechanism involving eNOS requires further investigation.",

Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) is an endothelial junction protein involved in leukocyte diapedesis. We hypothesize that in endothelial cells, statins may well recruit PECAM-1 to exert their inhibitory effect on leukocyte trans-endothelial migration (TEM). In lovastatin-treated resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), increased levels of mRNA and protein of PECAM-1 as well as its bio-synthesis (all approximately 2-fold) were observed by real-time PCR, Western blotting and 35S-labeled methionine incorporation assay, respectively. Moreover, in lovastatin treated resting cells as well as TNF-alpha activated endothelial cells, unanimously decreased Triton X-100 insoluble and soluble PECAM-1 ratio was observed. Such changes were accompanied by decreased TEM of U-937 cells (a promonocyte cell line). All lovastatin's effects were abrogated by mevalonic acid. In resting HUVECs, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) (both are isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway) compromised the effect of lovastatin on PECAM-1 expression, whereas C3 toxin, an inhibitor of small G proteins, exerted statin-like effect.",

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do not, however, offer complete protection against adenoma and carcinoma development. There is increasing interest in combining non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with agents that target specific cell signalling pathways in malignant and premalignant cells. This review aims to describe the current knowledge regarding the efficacy of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ligands, cholesterol synthesis inhibitors (statins), epidermal growth factor signalling inhibitors and tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand against colorectal neoplasms and the rationale for combining these drugs with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to improve efficacy in the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer, a PUBMED computer search of the English language literature was conducted to identify relevant papers published before July 2004. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ligands and statins, both in clinical use, reduce the growth rate of human colon cancer cells in vitro and in rodents models. In vitro, preclinical in vivo and clinical studies have shown efficacy of epidermal growth factor signalling inhibition in colorectal cancer. In vitro, tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand induces apoptosis in human colon cancer cells, but not in normal cells. These drugs have all been shown to interact with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in colorectal cancer cells and/or in rodent models. Combinational regimen are a promising strategy for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer and should be further explored.", 
    "94": "Hyperlipidaemia is a pivotal risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic disease. A large number of studies have demonstrated that the treatment of abnormalities in lipoprotein levels reduces the risk for myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease, carotid artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. Despite the development of multiple drug classes to treat dyslipidaemias and the promulgation of clearly defined guidelines for the management of lipid disorders, dyslipidaemia tends to be undertreated in the majority of patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. A part of the reluctance to treat different lipoprotein fractions to goal levels is attributable to physician- and patient-related concerns over the increasing toxicity of available therapies, as their dosages are increased. The risks of hepatotoxicity, myalgia, and rhabdomyolysis are fairly well characterised in patients receiving statins, fibrates and niacin. Another issue affecting treatment success rates is the fact that many patients with complex dyslipidaemias are inadequately responsive to single-agent therapy. As the epidemics of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus continue to worsen, physicians will encounter severe, mixed dyslipidaemias more frequently. Many of these patients will require combinations of drugs to address the various metabolic derangements causing changes in multiple lipoprotein fractions. Although the need for combination therapy is well-established in the management of disorders, such as hypertension and diabetes, it is less often used for the treatment of dyslipidaemias. The development of safe, cost-effective, and efficacious combination dyslipidaemic therapy is an important goal in cardiovascular medicine. Simvastatin plus ezetimibe has recently been combined as a fixed dose therapy, which offers clinicians the opportunity to simultaneously inhibit two key pathways in cholesterol metabolism: hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis and the absorption of cholesterol at the level of the proximal jejunum. This dual mechanism of inhibition substantially increases the capacity to decrease serum levels of atherogenic low-density lipoproteins and increase high-density lipoprotein, compared with that observed when either drug is used alone. This combination increases the likelihood of therapeutic success in patients with dyslipidaemia.", 
    "95": "Molecular and more specifically subcellular analyses of the neurodegenerative mechanisms involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) had been considered most of the time an interplay of proteins and genes. However, some of the observations could not be explained this way. Recently, a number of research groups found the missing link ... lipids! Among the variety of lipids that had been investigated, most investigations had been focused on cholesterol and some derivatives. A recent statistic found that for every primary research article on AD and cholesterol/statins, approximately two reviews were published. This clearly reflects as much the interest in this topic, as it gives evidence that this field is still in its juvenile phase and most aspects have yet to be covered or clarified. To date there is evidently no final answer to whether this approach will eventually provide a therapeutic solution to treat or prevent AD. At the end of the day such answers can only be obtained from clinical studies and to date only two studies with a suitable design have published their results, one of them with preliminary results only. This review focuses on what we know about the cellular mechanisms involved in the AD-lipid connection and what kinds of problematic issues; theoretical and practical, are at hand.", 
    "96": "Nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cardiac hypertrophy. Although it has been reported that statins inhibit cardiac hypertrophy by reducing generation of reactive oxygen species, it is not yet known whether statins prevent NF-kappa B activation and whether this effect can be related to the reduction in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway. In this study, we examined the role of atorvastatin on NF-kappa B activity and PPAR signaling in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Our findings indicate that atorvastatin inhibits cardiac hypertrophy and prevents the fall in the protein levels of PPAR alpha and PPAR beta/delta. Further, atorvastatin treatment avoided NF-kappa B activation during cardiac hypertrophy, reducing the protein-protein association between these PPAR subtypes and the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B. These findings indicate that negative cross-talk between NF-kappa B and PPARs may interfere with the transactivation capacity of the latter, leading to a fall in the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, and that these changes are prevented by statin treatment.",

The trial was a prospective double-blind randomised trial with 2383 type 2 diabetic subjects randomised to either 10-mg atorvastatin daily or placebo. Originally designed to run for 5 years, the trial was terminated over a year early in June 2003 on account of a clear benefit demonstrated for the intervention group. Over half of patients had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) below 3.3 mmol/l at entry and a quarter had an LDL-C <2.6 mmol/l. Atorvastatin 10 mg reduced LDL-C by 40% (1.2 mmol/l) on average. Results at 4 years showed a 37% relative risk reduction (p <0.001) for atorvastatin 10 mg in the primary endpoint (acute coronary heart disease death, fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring hospital admission, resuscitated cardiac arrest, coronary revascularisation procedures and stroke). Among the secondary endpoints, total mortality was reduced by 27% (p=0.05), acute coronary events by 36%, coronary revascularisation by 31% and stroke by 48%. The same magnitude of benefit was observed among patients with LDL-C above or below 3 mmol/l. Results observed were against a background where 9% of placebo patients had been permitted to start statin therapy after enrolment and 15% of patients on active treatment had discontinued atorvastatin. The true benefit of the intervention is therefore probably around 25% greater than the intention to treat analysis reports.", 
    "109": "The prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) has been increasing in the past few decades in Japan, as it has in industrialised countries worldwide. CHD risk can be substantially reduced by lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with dyslipidaemia. Statins are highly effective for this indication, but many patients treated with these drugs still do not meet their treatment goals, often because clinicians fail to titrate these patients to a higher, potentially more effective, dose. Thus, there is a need for more effective agents that can help patients reach their goals at starting doses. This paper reviews key clinical results for a new agent, rosuvastatin. The data show that rosuvastatin 5 mg is highly effective in lowering LDL-C to recommended levels for most patients (mean reductions ranging from 42 to 52%). In addition, rosuvastatin 5 mg effectively lowers triglycerides (-16%), total cholesterol (-30%), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C; -38%) and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels (-33%) and increases HDL-C (+8.2-13%) in a wide range of patients with hypercholesterolaemia, including the elderly, obese patients, postmenopausal women and patients with hypertension, CHD, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The 5-mg dose of rosuvastatin dose also produces greater reductions in LDL-C and larger increases in HDL-C than recommended initial doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin or pravastatin (for LDL-C reductions, p <0.001 vs. atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 20 mg; for HDL-C elevations, p <0.01 vs. atorvastatin 10 mg). These results demonstrate that rosuvastatin 5 mg produces favourable effects on the lipid profile and helps more patients achieve LDL-C goals than comparator statins.", 
    "110": "CHD (coronary heart disease) is a complex disorder which is, in part, related to serum cholesterol levels. The rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of cholesterol into bile acids is CYP7A1 (cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase). The effect of the CYP7A1 A-278C promoter polymorphism on the progression of atherosclerosis, risk of a new clinical event and the influence of this variant on cholesterol-lowering therapy was investigated in 715 male patients with coronary atherosclerosis participating in REGRESS (Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study). Genotype distributions were as follows: 283 with AA; 330 with AC and 102 with CC. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and serum lipids between genotypes. After 2 years, CC carriers had more progression of diffuse and focal atherosclerosis compared with AA carriers, as indicated by a larger decrease in MSD (mean segment diameter; 0.09 mm compared with 0.06 mm respectively; P=0.009) and MOD (minimum obstruction diameter; 0.09 mm compared with 0.05 mm respectively; P=0.024). Inclusion of risk factors for CHD in the model showed the same trend, although not significant for MOD (P=0.01 for MSD, and P=0.06 for MOD). In addition, CC carriers had an almost 2-fold higher risk of a new clinical event compared with AA carriers [RR (95% CI) 1.93 (1.11-3.36); P=0.02; where RR is relative risk and CI is confidence interval]. Inclusion of risk factors for CHD in the model showed the same trend, although not significant [RR (95% CI), 1.74 (0.96-3.12); P=0.06]. In conclusion, we present evidence that the CC variant of the A-278C polymorphism in the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of cholesterol, CYP7A1, increases the progression of atherosclerosis and possibly the risk of a new clinical event.", 
    "111": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide. Metabolic syndrome, comprising abdominal obesity, elevated triglyceride levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, and impaired glucose metabolism, greatly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke. The high prevalence of metabolic syndrome among individuals who experience stroke makes the metabolic syndrome a target for aggressive intervention and therapy. In addition to lifestyle changes, therapy with statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, insulin sensitizers, and antithrombotic agents to aggressively treat elements of metabolic syndrome is warranted. Statins favorably affect both lipid and nonlipid risk factors for stroke, making them a useful tool for stroke prevention.", 
    "112": "The metabolic syndrome is a clustering of risk factors that, in the aggregate, sharply increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The syndrome is characterized by abdominal obesity, a characteristic atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance with or without hyperglycemia, a prothrombotic state, and a proinflammatory state. CVD is the most important clinical sequela of the metabolic syndrome. The syndrome also carries a greatly increased risk for development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which in turn increases cardiovascular risk even further. Conventional risk formulas may underestimate actual CVD risk in metabolic syndrome patients because of their concentration of nontraditional risk factors. Management of the metabolic syndrome should focus on weight loss, increased physical activity, and improvement of atherogenic diet. Pharmacologic therapy for lipids and blood pressure will be needed in most cases. The atherogenic dyslipidemia includes high triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol particles. Management should allow for statin in virtually all cases, accompanied by a triglyceride-lowering agent in many cases. Hypertension should be managed aggressively, with a blood pressure target of 130/80 mm Hg. Multiple agents are usually required to treat hypertension. Simultaneous management of multiple risk factors has the potential to greatly reduce the incidence of CVD in individuals with the metabolic syndrome.",

Overall, patients were more likely to receive a statin at hospital discharge in the intervention group compared to the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.0). Attainment of the goal for LDL-C level was similar between the intervention and control groups in the overall sample. Patients who were not at their LDL-C goal at baseline were more likely to have a follow-up LDL-C level of < 100 mg/dL in the intervention group (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.5).

    "124": "Although statins are lipid-lowering drugs that block cholesterol biosynthesis, they exert immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative functions by reducing the isoprenylation of proteins involved in cell signal transduction such as Ras and RhoA. In this study, we provide evidence that several natural (lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin) and synthetic (cerivastatin and atorvastatin) statins exert a cytotoxic effect on human T, B and myeloma tumor cells by promoting their apoptosis. Dissimilar susceptibility to apoptosis has been detected in these lines, presumably in relation to the altered expression of proteins involved in the regulation of cellular signals. Cerivastatin promptly activated the cell death even in doxorubicin resistant cell lines such as MCC-2, whereas pravastatin, a hydrophilic compound, failed to induce any effect on either proliferation or apoptosis. The statin-induced apoptotic pathway in these cell lines was presumably regulated by altered prenylation of either Ras or RhoA, as measured by the defective membrane localization of these small GTPases. In addition the cell proliferation was rescued by both farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranyl-geranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), whereas no effect was obtained with squalene, a direct precursor of cholesterol. Statins primed apoptosis through its intrinsic pathway involving the mitochondria. In fact, we observed the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and the cytosolic release of the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac/DIABLO). The apoptotic pathway was caspase-dependent since caspases 9, 3 and 8 were efficiently activated. These results support the potential use of statins in association with conventional treatment as apoptosis-triggering agents in these tumors.", 
    "125": "Cardiac stem cells or myoblasts are vulnerable to inflammatory stimulation in hearts with infarction or ischemic injury. Widely used for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic heart disease, the cholesterol-lowering drugs statins may exert anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we examined the impact of inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase with simvastatin on the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in embryonic cardiac myoblasts stimulated with the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis factor. Treatment with simvastatin significantly reduced the levels of iNOS mRNA and protein in cytokine-treated rat H9c2 cardiac embryonic myoblasts. Addition of the HMG-CoA reductase product, L-mevalonate, and the by-product of cholesterol synthesis, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, could reverse the statin inhibitory effect on iNOS expression. Simvastatin treatment lowered the Rho GTPase activities, whereas the Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y27632 partially blocked the statin inhibitory effect on nitrite production in the cytokine-treated H9c2 cells. Treatment with simvastatin led to inactivation of NF-kappaB by elevation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB and reduction of the NF-kappaB nuclear contents in the cytokine-stimulated H9c2 cells. Hence, treatment with simvastatin can attenuate iNOS expression and NO synthesis in cytokine-stimulated embryonic cardiac myoblasts. The statin inhibitory effect may occur through isoprenoid-mediated intracellular signal transduction, which involves several key signal proteins, such as Rho kinase and IkappaB/NF-kappaB. These data suggest that statin therapy may protect the cardiac myocyte progenitors against the cytotoxicity of cytokine-induced high output of NO production in infarcted or ischemic hearts with inflammation.", 
    "126": "The most concerning adverse reaction with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) is myotoxicity. Statins inhibit the production of mevalonate, a precursor of both cholesterol and coenzyme Q10, a compound believed to be crucial for mitochondrial function and the provision of energy for cellular processes. There is speculation that a reduction in coenzyme Q10 concentrations may promote the myopathies that have been associated with statin treatment as a result of mitochondrial damage. Although studies have repeatedly demonstrated a reduction in circulating coenzyme Q10 concentrations with statin therapy, it is unclear as to whether tissue levels of coenzyme Q10 are significantly affected. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation has been shown to reverse statin-induced decreases in circulating coenzyme Q10 concentrations, although the effect of supplementation on tissue coenzyme Q10 concentrations and any resulting clinical benefit has not been adequately assessed. Although there is not much of a safety concern with coenzyme Q10 supplementation, there is also not enough evidence to support its routine use for preventing the adverse effects of statin therapy, and it is therefore not recommended for this purpose at this time.", 
    "127": "In this study, we attempted to evaluate the effect of administration of a high quantity of red yeast rice on coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) synthesis in the tissues of ICR mice. Eighty-eight adult male ICR mice were housed and divided into control and experimental groups for red yeast rice treatment. Animals were gavaged with a low (1 g/kg body weight) or a high dose (5 g/kg body weight, approximately five times the typical recommended human dose) of red yeast rice dissolved in soyabean oil. After gavagement, animals of the control group were immediately killed; mice of the experimental groups (eight for each subgroup) were killed at different time intervals of 0.5, 1, 1.5, 4 and 24 h. The liver, heart and kidney were taken for analysis of monacolin K (liver only) and CoQ10 analysis. Liver and heart CoQ10 levels declined dramatically in both groups administered red yeast rice, especially in the high-dose group, within 30 min. After 24 h, the levels of hepatic and cardiac CoQ10 were still reduced. A similar trend was also observed in the heart, but the inhibitory effect began after 90 min. The higher dose of red yeast rice presented a greater suppressive effect than did the lower dose on tissue CoQ10 levels. In conclusion, acute red yeast rice gavage suppressed hepatic and cardiac CoQ10 levels in rodents; furthermore, the inhibitory effect was responsive to the doses administered.",

    "138": "Recent data have indicated that CRP (C-reactive protein) plays a role in atherosclerosis, in addition to being a marker for inflammatory diseases. IL-8 (interleukin-8), a CXC chemokine, is present in human coronary atheroma and promotes monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. In the present study, we examined the effect of pitavastatin (NK-104), a synthetic statin (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor), on IL-8 production induced by CRP in human AoEC (aortic endothelial cells). We also investigated whether CRP can induce IL-8 production and if the activation of signalling pathways are functionally related. The concentrations of IL-8 in the media after stimulation with CRP were measured by ELISA, and the expression of IL-8 mRNA was assessed by Northern blot. The phosphorylation of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) was determined by Western blot. The production of IL-8 induced by CRP (10 microg/ml) was enhanced significantly and was inhibited by pitavastatin. The expression of IL-8 mRNA was increased in a dose-dependent manner after stimulation with CRP (1-100 microg/ml), whereas expression of IL-8 mRNA induced by CRP (50 microg/ml) was significantly diminished by 5 microM pitavastatin. Furthermore, specific MAPK inhibitors (PD98059, SB203580 and SP600125) inhibited the expression of IL-8 mRNA induced by CRP (50 microg/ml). The phosphorylation of all three MAPKs [ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), p38 MAPK and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)] induced by CRP (10 microg/ml) was also significantly inhibited by pitavastatin. Our results suggest that CRP may play a role in atherosclerosis via IL-8 production and pitavastatin may prevent the progression of atherosclerosis not only by lowering plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but also by suppressing IL-8 production in endothelial cells through the inhibition of MAPK (ERK, p38 MAPK and JNK) pathways.", 
    "139": "The preventive effect of statins on coronary events is not only associated with the cholesterol-lowering effect of these drugs, but also various direct effects on the vascular wall, which include improvement of endothelial function, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory activity. We investigated whether short-term statin therapy could improve arterial stiffness and assessed its mechanism of action in patients with hypercholesterolemia. We assessed arterial stiffness in 10 patients (mean age: 62.9 +/- 9.0 years) with hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol > or =220 mg/dl). The patients were treated with cerivastatin (0.15 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Before and after 4 weeks of treatment, we determined arterial stiffness from brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and the ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI) using a FORM apparatus (Colin, Komaki, Japan). We also measured the blood levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and malondialdehyde low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) as markers of inflammation and oxidation, respectively. After statin therapy, both the right and left abPWV were significantly decreased from 1544.6 +/- 157.1 to 1349.0 +/- 223.9 cm/s and from 1592.1 +/- 164.8 to 1424.8 +/- 245.2 cm/s, respectively (P < 0.05). However, the ABI was unchanged after 4 weeks of cerivastatin therapy. MDA-LDL decreased significantly (from 161.2 +/- 42.4 to 119.4 +/- 33.5 U/l, P < 0.05) and hsCRP also decreased. Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol decreased, while triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were unchanged. Blood pressure was not significantly altered from the baseline value by statin therapy.

Three years later, we identified 185 cases of incident dementia (104 with AD) among 3308 survivors at risk. Statin use at baseline did not predict incidence of dementia or AD (adjusted hazard ratio for dementia, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-2.34; adjusted hazard ratio for AD, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-2.96), nor did statin use at follow-up (adjusted odds ratio for dementia, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-1.81; adjusted odds ratio for AD, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-1.88).", 
    "147": "Although statin use might be less frequent in those with prevalent dementia, we found no association between statin use and subsequent onset of dementia or AD. Further research is warranted before costly dementia prevention trials with statins are undertaken.", 
    "148": "3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors reduce serum cholesterol and are increasingly advocated in primary prevention to achieve reductions in LDL cholesterol. Newer dietary approaches combining cholesterol-lowering foods may offer another option, but these approaches have not been compared directly with statins in the same persons.", 
    "149": "The objective was to compare, in the same subjects, the cholesterol-lowering potential of a dietary portfolio with that of a statin.", 
    "150": "Thirty-four hyperlipidemic participants underwent all three 1-mo treatments in random order as outpatients: a very-low-saturated-fat diet (control diet), the same diet plus 20 mg lovastatin (statin diet), and a diet high in plant sterols (1.0 g/1000 kcal), soy-protein foods (including soy milks and soy burgers, 21.4 g/1000 kcal), almonds (14 g/1000 kcal), and viscous fibers from oats, barley, psyllium, and the vegetables okra and eggplant (10 g/1000 kcal) (portfolio diets). Fasting blood samples were obtained at 0, 2, and 4 wk.", 
    "151": "LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased by 8.5+/-1.9%, 33.3+/-1.9%, and 29.6+/-1.3% after 4 wk of the control, statin, and portfolio diets, respectively. Although the absolute difference between the statin and the portfolio treatments was significant at 4 wk (P=0.013), 9 participants (26%) achieved their lowest LDL-cholesterol concentrations with the portfolio diet. Moreover, the statin (n=27) and the portfolio (n=24) diets did not differ significantly (P=0.288) in their ability to reduce LDL cholesterol below the 3.4-mmol/L primary prevention cutoff.", 
    "152": "Dietary combinations may not differ in potency from first-generation statins in achieving current lipid goals for primary prevention. They may, therefore, bridge the treatment gap between current therapeutic diets and newer statins.", 
    "153": "Intraocular inflammatory diseases are a common cause of severe visual impairment and blindness. In an acute mouse model of autoimmune retinal disease, we demonstrate that treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, suppresses clinical ocular pathology, retinal vascular leakage, and leukocytic infiltration into the retina. Efficacy was reversed by coadministration of mevalonolactone, the downstream product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, but not by squalene, which is distal to isoprenoid pyrophosphate metabolites within the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Lovastatin treatment (20 mg/kg/day i.p.) over 7 days, which resulted in plasma lovastatin hydroxyacid concentrations of 0.098 +/- 0.03 microM, did not induce splenocyte Th2 cytokine production but did cause a small reduction in Ag-induced T cell proliferation and a decrease in the production of IFN-gamma and IL-10. Thus, it is possible to dissociate the therapeutic effect of statins in experimental autoimmune uveitic mice from their activity on the Th1/Th2 balance. Statins inhibit isoprenoid pyrophosphate synthesis, precursors required for the prenylation and posttranslational activation of Rho GTPase, a key molecule in the endothelial ICAM-1-mediated pathway that facilitates lymphocyte migration. Consistent with inhibition of leukocyte infiltration in vivo, lovastatin treatment of retinal endothelial cell monolayers in vitro leads to inhibition of lymphocyte transmigration, which may, in part, account for drug efficacy. Unlike lovastatin, atorvastatin treatment showed little efficacy in retinal inflammatory disease despite showing significant clinical benefit in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. These data highlight the potential differential activity of statins in different inflammatory conditions and their possible therapeutic use for the treatment of human posterior uveitis.", 
    "154": "Increasing evidence suggests that statins may have pleiotropic effects on vascular wall independent of their cholesterol lowering properties. In the present study, we investigated the acute vascular effects of pravastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin on rat isolated aortic rings. Statins effectively and comparably relaxed the aortic rings precontracted submaximally with noradrenaline, in a concentration-dependent manner, in which a high potency was observed with cerivastatin. Endothelium removal or incubation of the aortic rings with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NOARG (10(-4) M) and/or cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10(-5) M) significantly attenuated the acute vasorelaxation induced by either of statin. Additionally, different from the other two statins, a significant reduction was observed in response to cerivastatin in the presence of KATP channel inhibitor, glibenclamide (10(-5) M) and Na+- K+ ATPase inhibitor, ouabain (10(-4) M). Furthermore, pretreatment of the rings with the cholesterol precursor mevalonate (10(-3) M) significantly inhibited the endothelium-mediated relaxant effects of the statins. Our findings suggest that statins could acutely modulate vascular tone importantly by endothelium-dependent and mevalonate-related pathways.", 
    "155": "Serum plant sterol levels are increased by consumption of statins and dietary plant sterols, and decreased by dietary plant stanols, but little is known about combination therapy of statin and plant sterols.", 
    "156": "We measured plant sterols in serum, lipoproteins, and red cells in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (n=18) treated with variable doses of statins off and on plant stanol (STA) and sterol ester (STE) spreads.", 
    "157": "STA and STE spreads lowered LDL cholesterol approximately 15%. Plant sterols were decreased in serum, lipoproteins, and red cells by approximately 25% with STA and increased from 37% to 80% with STE, especially with high statin doses. The changes in serum were related to those in red cells. The baseline levels of serum plant sterols were negatively (r-range -0.639 to -0.935) and positively (r-range 0.526 to 0.598) correlated with the respective changes evoked by the STA and STE spreads.", 
    "158": "STE reduces LDL cholesterol, but increases serum, lipoprotein, and red cell plant sterol levels in statin-treated FH subjects, while all the respective values are decreased with STA. Recent predictions that elevated serum plant sterols pose an increased coronary risk suggest that increases of serum plant sterol levels should be avoided, especially in atherosclerosis-prone individuals, such as subjects with FH.", 
    "159": "Inflammation plays a critic role in atherosclerosis and C-reactive protein (CRP) may directly facilitate the development of a proinflammatory and proatheroscleroitc phenotype. The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signal transduction is known to play a key role in the expression of these proatherogenic entities including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Much data suggest that statin possess a potential anti-inflammatory effect. However, the effects of statin on the expression of TNF-alpha and activation of NF-kappaB in endothelial cells stimulated by CRP are less studied. We determined the effects of CRP in inducing inflammatory response and the effect of fluvastatin on CRP-dependent inflammatory activation in human cultured endothelial cells.", 
    "160": "Human vascular endothelial cells were cultured and stimulated by concentrations of CRP (5-100 microg/ml) for 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h. Also 10 micromol/l of fluvastatin was pre-incubated for 2 h with cells in the presence of CRP. The activity of transcription factor NF-kappaB was evaluated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Measurements of TNF-alpha were performed from supernatants of cultured medium in duplicate, using commercial assay kits.", 
    "161": "CRP increased the release of TNF-alpha rapidly as a dose-and time-dependent manner. Induction of TNF-alpha was detected at 5 microg/ml and reached a maximum at 100 microg/ml of CRP. The CRP also significantly induces the activation of NF-kappaB in endothelial cells, and those effects were apparently inhibited by 10 micromol/l of fluvastatin, but not complete.", 
    "162": "CRP stimulation result in induction of TNF-alpha and activation of NF-kappaB, and this effect could be significantly inhibited by fluvastatin, suggesting that CRP may play a direct role in atherogenesis by activating endothelial cells, and statins inhibit this response, which may provide an insight into the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory or anti-atherosclerotic actions of statins.",
