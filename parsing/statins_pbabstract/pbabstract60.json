    "0": "Statins are the most widely used drugs for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and those associated with atherosclerosis. About 25 million people are on statin therapy in the world. Although they are well tolerated by most patients and have a safety profile, some patients have muscle level alterations. The biological effects associated with these drugs are known as pleiotropic; they are of such interest and diversity that explains, in part, some of the actions of statins, especially in relation to inflammation and the immune system. Some patients have certain immune disorders that can turn into an undesirable clinical expression. Recent studies have shown that they can trigger autoimmune phenomena. Pathologies have been described in which these agents act as triggers such as immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy or indirectly in dermatomyositis or autoimmune hepatitis, among others. Given the high number of people being treated with statins, we believe that this is a clinically relevant problem and therefore worthy of study.",

A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel-group trial (the DALI study group) on 217 patients with T2DM and dyslipidemia was performed. Urinary samples were collected before and after administration of a standard dose (10 mg/d, n=73), a maximal dose atorvastatin (80 mg/d, n=72) or placebo (n=72) for 30 weeks. Urinary nitrite and nitrate were measured to assess whole body NO synthesis. The urinary molar ratio of nitrate to nitrite (UNOxR) served as a measure of renal CA activity. Free radical- and cyclooxygenase (COX)-catalyzed lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1). In subgroups, systemic PGI2 and TxA2 synthesis was assessed by measuring their major urinary metabolites 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1\u03b1 and 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2, respectively. All biochemical parameters were measured by GC-MS and GC-MS/MS methods. T2DM patients had elevated levels of nitrate, nitrite, UNOxR, and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 compared to healthy non-diabetic and normolipidemic subjects. Thirty-week treatment with atorvastatin (10 or 80 mg/d) did not significantly alter NO, PGI2, TxA2 and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 synthesis and did not improve the renal reabsorption of nitrite which is considered an important reservoir of NO. Our study suggests that atorvastatin (10 or 80 mg/d) does not provide cardiovascular benefit beyond its cholesterol lowering effect in patients with T2DM.",

In a post-hoc analysis to compare statins, we combined data from PLANET I with those from PLANET II (a similar randomised parallel study of 237 patients with proteinuria but without diabetes; registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00296400). In this analysis, atorvastatin 80 mg lowered UPCR significantly more than did rosuvastatin 10 mg (-15\u00b76%, 95% CI -28\u00b73 to -0\u00b75; p=0\u00b7043) and rosuvastatin 40 mg (-18\u00b72%, -30\u00b72 to -4\u00b72; p=0\u00b7013).

We investigated how to alterations of serum hepatic synthesised cholesterol and plant sterols levels, clinical markers for inflammation and oxidative stress after combination therapy with ezetimibe, an inhibitor of cholesterol transporter in the small intestinal colon, and statin drugs in type 2 diabetic patients. Studies were conducted in 28 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with dyslipidemia. Patients were divided into 3 groups as follows: the 1st group is 7 patients treated with 10mg ezetimibe sequent on pretreatment with mild statin drug (MS+E group), and the 2nd group is 7 patients treated with 10mg ezetimibe sequent on pretreatment with strong statin drug (SS+E group), and then the 3rd group is 14 patients treated with 10mg ezetimibe alone without pretreatment with any statin drugs (na\u00efve E group). In addition to various metabolic markers, serum plant sterols such as sitosterol and campesterol, and hepatic synthesised cholesterol such as lathosterol were measured by the gas liquid chromatography. Serum highly sensitive CRP (hsCRP) as an inflammation marker, and then malonyldealdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl-modified protein (CMP) as an oxidative stress were assayed by the conventional method, respectively. Fasting plasma glucose and serum glucosylated HbA1c (JDS value) did not show any significant changes after administration of ezetimibe in whole groups. Serum LDL-C was reduced significantly and serum triglyceride exhibited a tendency of reduction in whole groups. Serum sitosterol and campesterol were decreased significantly, while serum lathosterol was increased significantly or markedly in whole patients and also in each group. There were no significant changes in serum hsCRP in whole groups. Both serum MDA and CMP revealed significant or marked reductions in each group.",

    "26": "NAFLD has become the most common liver disorder in countries, where obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome are common. The strong association between these conditions and the risk of cardiovascular disease make treatment crucial. Possible interventions for NAFLD target excess body weight, insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress or intestinal lipid absorption. Administration of combination therapy with a statin plus ezetimibe, associated with lifestyle changes, may represent an effective strategy because of the strong reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Combination therapy is often more effective, especially when complementary mechanisms of action are involved. Ezetimibe is effective and well tolerated in combination with a number of lipid lowering therapies, including statins, orlistat, and insulin-sensitizing agents. There is strong evidence from preclinical models to supporting the use of ezetimibe in this setting. Larger controlled trials are needed to confirm its effectiveness in patients with NAFLD, to establish the most efficacious combinations and to determine whether treatment can reverse fibrosis.", 
    "27": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a major role in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism, mostly through control of low-density lipoprotein receptor degradation. Depletion of cellular cholesterol causes a compensatory increase in plasma PCSK9 levels, which can diminish the cholesterol-lowering power of statins and may lead to the overproduction of intestinal lipoproteins, mainly thorough the up regulation of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein, the target of ezetimibe. Thus, ezetimibe therapy may counter this unwanted effect of statins, providing an additional theoretical rationale for combining the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption and that of statins on cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "28": "Ezetimibe exerts multiple favorable effects on the lipoprotein profile and reduces some inflammatory markers. Decreasing cholesterol synthesis with statin treatment can cause a compensatory increase in cholesterol absorption that reduces the efficacy of statin therapy, whereas addition of a cholesterol absorption inhibitor can improve outcomes. Recent evidence suggests a beneficial effect on atherosclerosis. In patients with diabetes, the effect of insulin resistance on low-density lipoprotein metabolism combined with the effect of hyperglycemia on cholesterol absorption may further diminish the favorable effects of statins. Further analysis is needed also to determine whether the stronger effects of ezetimibe seen in patients with diabetes are a consequence of an interaction of the drug with specific mechanisms.", 
    "29": "Patients with diabetes represent a population at higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by the so-called atherogenic lipid triad, consisting of an increase in small dense low density lipoprotein particles and in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with an increase in non-HDL cholesterol. Numerous trials have investigated the efficacy of add-on ezetimibe therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes and not controlled by statin therapy. The published data highly suggest that patients with type 2 diabetes may be more likely to benefit from ezetimibe/statin combination therapy. However, evidence specifically addressing hard clinical endpoints and prospective trials addressing differences in response between patients with or without diabetes are still needed.",

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) can be activated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u00e2) and play an important role in angiogenesis leading to PTH. Statins potently stimulate the transcription factor, Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2), which can negatively regulate angiogenesis. Our present study aimed to investigate the anti-angiogenic potential of statins in HSCs through the KLF2 pathway.",

Furthermore, simvastatin promoted already increased mRNA and protein levels of KLF2 in TGF\u00e2-induced HSCs. In accordance with KLF2 overexpression, simvastatin increased production of endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (eNOS) and downregulated expression of some proangiogenic proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1a and nuclear factor-kappa B in TGF\u00e2-induced HSCs. At the same time, secretion of interferon-gamma increased in TGF\u00e2 induced HSCs, which was decreased by simultaneous addition of simvastatin.",

Cognitive function was measured with the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT; worst score, 0; best score, 175 points) and the Visual Association Test (VAT; low performance, 0-10; high performance, 11-12 points) in an observational study that included 4,095 community-dwelling participants aged 35-82 years. Data on statin use were obtained from a computerized pharmacy database. Analysis were done for the total cohort and subsamples matched on cardiovascular risk (N = 1232) or propensity score for statin use (N = 3609). We found that a total of 904 participants (10%) used a statin. Statin users were older than non-users: mean age (SD) 61 (10) vs. 52 (11) years (p < 0.001). The median duration of statin use was 3.8 (interquartile range, 1.6-4.5) years. Unadjusted, statin users had worse cognitive performance than non-users. The mean RFFT score (SD) in statin users and non-users was 58 (23) and 72 (26) points, respectively (p < 0.001). VAT performance was high in 261 (29%) statin users and 1351 (43%) non-users (p < 0.001). However, multiple regression analysis did not show a significant association of RFFT score with statin use (B, -0.82; 95%CI, -2.77 to 1.14; p = 0.41) nor with statin solubility, statin dose or duration of statin use. Statin users with high doses or long-term use had similar cognitive performance as non-users. This was found in persons with low as well as high cardiovascular risk, and in younger as well as older subjects. Also, the mean RFFT score per quintile of propensity score for statin use was comparable for statin users and non-users. Similar results were found for the VAT score as outcome measure. In conclusion, statin use was not associated with cognitive function. This was independent of statin dose or duration of statin use.",

Lifestyle factors that promote CVD also appear to increase prostate cancer risk and those that reduce CVD risk also appear to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The largest randomized trials utilizing dietary supplements or pharmacologic agents for prostate cancer prevention (Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial [SELECT]) have also shed light on the problems and future solutions in this area. Dietary supplements that have not been found to be CVD protective, such as selenium and Vitamin E have not been found to be prostate protective. In addition, over exposure to specific anti-oxidants in nutritionally replete populations may be encouraging cancer growth. Future trials of dietary supplements to prevent prostate cancer could be problematic because by the time a definitive trial is initiated the participants will no longer be \"deficient\" in the nutrient being tested, which arguably occurred in the SELECT trial. It is also interesting that statins, aspirin, and/or metformin (S.A.M.) are 3 generic, low-cost, heart healthy agents derived from natural sources with separate mechanism of actions, which all appear to have the best benefit to risk ratio compared to any other agent available for prostate cancer prevention, especially aggressive disease, or as an ancillary agent (s) to conventional cancer treatment.

    "58": "In contrast to the current belief that cholesterol reduction with statins decreases atherosclerosis, we present a perspective that statins may be causative in coronary artery calcification and can function as mitochondrial toxins that impair muscle function in the heart and blood vessels through the depletion of coenzyme Q10 and 'heme A', and thereby ATP generation. Statins inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K2, the cofactor for matrix Gla-protein activation, which in turn protects arteries from calcification. Statins inhibit the biosynthesis of selenium containing proteins, one of which is glutathione peroxidase serving to suppress peroxidative stress. An impairment of selenoprotein biosynthesis may be a factor in congestive heart failure, reminiscent of the dilated cardiomyopathies seen with selenium deficiency. Thus, the epidemic of heart failure and atherosclerosis that plagues the modern world may paradoxically be aggravated by the pervasive use of statin drugs. We propose that current statin treatment guidelines be critically reevaluated.", 
    "59": "The emergence of micro sampling techniques holds great potential to improve pharmacokinetic data quality, reduce animal usage, and save costs in safety assessment studies. The analysis of these samples presents new challenges for bioanalytical scientists, both in terms of sample processing and analytical sensitivity. The use of two dimensional LC/MS with, at-column-dilution for the direct analysis of highly organic extracts prepared from biological fluids such as dried blood spots and plasma is demonstrated. This technique negated the need to dry down and reconstitute, or dilute samples with water/aqueous buffer solutions, prior to injection onto a reversed-phase LC system. A mixture of model drugs, including bromhexine, triprolidine, enrofloxacin, and procaine were used to test the feasibility of the method. Finally an LC/MS assay for the probe pharmaceutical rosuvastatin was developed from dried blood spots and protein-precipitated plasma. The assays showed acceptable recovery, accuracy and precision according to US FDA guidelines. The resulting analytical method showed an increase in assay sensitivity of up to forty fold as compared to conventional methods by maximizing the amount loaded onto the system and the MS response for the probe pharmaceutical rosuvastatin from small volume samples.", 
    "60": "NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels that mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS. Although these receptors are in direct contact with plasma membrane, lipid-NMDAR interactions are little understood. In the present study, we aimed at characterizing the effect of cholesterol on the ionotropic glutamate receptors. Whole-cell current responses induced by fast application of NMDA in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) were almost abolished (reduced to 3%) and the relative degree of receptor desensitization was increased (by seven-fold) after acute cholesterol depletion by methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. Both of these effects were fully reversible by cholesterol repletion. By contrast, the responses mediated by AMPA/kainate receptors were not affected by cholesterol depletion. Similar results were obtained in CGCs after chronic inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by simvastatin and acute enzymatic cholesterol degradation to 4-cholesten-3-one by cholesterol oxidase. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements showed that membrane fluidity increased after methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin pretreatment. However, no change in fluidity was observed after cholesterol enzymatic degradation, suggesting that the effect of cholesterol on NMDARs is not mediated by changes in membrane fluidity. Our data show that diminution of NMDAR responses by cholesterol depletion is the result of a reduction of the open probability, whereas the increase in receptor desensitization is the result of an increase in the rate constant of entry into the desensitized state. Surface NMDAR population, agonist affinity, single-channel conductance and open time were not altered in cholesterol-depleted CGCs. The results of our experiments show that cholesterol is a strong endogenous modulator of NMDARs.",

The AIM-HIGH trial examined the benefits of adding extended-release niacin (ERN) to simvastatin in patients with established coronary heart disease. Here we conducted a post hoc analysis of the AIM-HIGH trial examining whether participants derived cardiovascular or renal benefits when stratified by renal function. Of 3414 participants, 505 had stage 3 CKD at baseline. Among the CKD subset, demographics and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors were well balanced in the ERN and placebo arms. Compared with placebo, CKD participants receiving ERN had a significant decrease in triglycerides by a median of 59.0\u2009mg/dl, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly increased by a mean of 11.3\u2009mg/dl over a mean follow-up of 3 years. CVD events were similar between CKD participants in both arms. However, all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the ERN group (hazard ratio of 1.73). Mean change in eGFR among ERN-treated CKD participants was not significantly different between study arms. Thus, among AIM-HIGH participants with CKD, the addition of ERN to simvastatin for secondary prevention of CVD improved triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations but did not improve cardiovascular outcomes or kidney function, and was associated with higher all-cause mortality.",

At the ages when PCa is usually diagnosed, mortality related to cardiovascular morbidity is high; therefore, men at risk for PCa frequently receive chronic lipid-lowering and antiplatelet treatment. The aim of this study was to analyze how chronic treatment with statins, aspirin, and their combination influenced the risk of PCa detection. The tumorigenic properties of these treatments were evaluated by proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration assays using different PCa cell lines, in order to assess how these treatments act at molecular level. The results showed that a combination of statins and aspirin enhances the effect of individual treatments and seems to reduce the risk of PCa detection (OR: 0.616 (95% CI: 0.467-0.812), P<0.001). However, if treatments are maintained, aspirin (OR: 1.835 (95% CI: 1.068-3.155), P=0.028) or the combination of both drugs (OR: 3.059 (95% CI: 1.894-4.939), P<0.001) represents an increased risk of HGPCa.

    "90": "Previously, we reported that cardiac matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 is upregulated in hypertensive mice. How MMP-2 affects the development of cardiac disease is unclear. Here, we report that MMP-2 protects from hypertensive cardiac disease. In mice infused with angiotensin II, the lack of MMP-2 (Mmp2(-/-)) did not affect the severity of the hypertension but caused cardiac hypertrophy to develop earlier and to a greater extent versus wild-type (Mmp2(+/+)) mice, as measured by heart weight:body weight ratio and upregulation of hypertrophy and fibrosis markers. We further found numerous metabolic and inflammatory gene expression abnormalities in the left ventricle of Mmp2(-/-) mice. Interestingly, Mmp2(-/-) mice expressed greater amounts of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (a target of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2-mediated transcription and rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol and isoprenoids biosynthesis) in addition to markers of inflammation including chemokines of the C-C motif ligand family. We focused on the functionally related genes for sterol regulatory binding protein-2 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, attenuated angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in Mmp2(-/-) and wild-type (Mmp2(+/+)) mice, with Mmp2(-/-) mice showing resistance to cardioprotection by lovastatin. MMP-2 deficiency predisposes to cardiac dysfunction as well as metabolic and inflammatory gene expression dysregulation. This complex phenotype is, at least in part, because of the cardiac sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2/3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway being upregulated in MMP-2 deficiency.", 
    "91": "In a previous paper Guillaume's group demonstrated that magnesium (Mg(2+) concentration range 0.00-2.60 mm) increased the passive diffusion of statins and thus played a role in their potential toxicity. In order to confirm an increase in this passive diffusion by divalent salt cations, the role of calcium chloride (CaCl2) on the statin-immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) association was studied. It was demonstrated that calcium supplementation (Ca(2+) concentration range 0.00-3.25 mm) increases the statin passive diffusion. In addition, it was shown that the Ca(2+) effect on the statin-IAM association is higher than that of Mg(2+). These results show that Ca(2+) enhances the passive diffusion of drugs into biological membranes and thus their potential toxicity. Also, addition of H2O2 to the medium showed a hyperbolic response for the statin passive diffusion and this effect was enhanced for the highest Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) concentrations in the medium. H2O2 is likely to interact with the polar head groups of the IAM through dipole-dipole interactions. The conformational changes in H2O2-IAM result in a higher degree of exposure of hydrophobic areas, thus explaining why the binding of pravastatin, which showed the lowest logP value, was less affected by H2O2. This result shows the significant contribution of H2O2 and thus the oxidative stress on the statin passive diffusion. Much of the sensitivity derives from the action of Ca(2+) or Mg(2+), in turn supported the idea that H2O2 may serve a Ca(2+) or Mg(2+) sensing function in statin passive diffusion.",

The major findings were that ATP, ADP, and CD73 values were higher in atherosclerotic patients than in controls without clinically evident peripheral artery disease (P<0.0001). Low CD39 activity was associated with disease progression (P=0.01). In multivariable linear regression models, high CD73 activity was associated with chronic hypoxia (P=0.001). Statin use was associated with lower ADP (P=0.041) and tended to associate with higher CD73 (P=0.054), while lower ATP was associated with the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (P=0.015).",

Elevated levels of circulating ATP and ADP are especially associated with atherosclerotic diseases of younger age and smoking. The antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects of statins may partly be explained by their ability to lower ADP. We suggest that the prothrombotic nature of smoking could be a cause of elevated ADP, and this may explain why cardiovascular patients who smoke benefit from platelet P2Y12 receptor antagonists more than their nonsmoking peers.",

The teratogenicity associated with hyperglycemia in early pregnancy is well documented, and tight glucose control minimizes the risk of congenital malformation. Preconception planning is essential; thus contraception that does not worsen complications of diabetes is desirable. In addition, because contraceptives are not 100% effective, the treatment of elevated blood glucose levels, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in these women requires consideration of unplanned pregnancy. We summarized the literature to aid clinicians in choosing individualized treatment that minimizes risk in case pregnancy occurs and maximizes benefit in preventing the complications of diabetes. In women with well-controlled diabetes without vascular disease, all contraceptive methods are safe. Intrauterine devices are recommended due to their minimal effects on risk factors for diabetic complications and their lack of reliance on patient adherence for efficacy. Among insulins, the insulin analogs-insulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin detemir-offer patients greater convenience than regular insulin and NPH insulin, and they are safe in case of unplanned pregnancy. Of the noninsulin agents, glyburide and metformin are the safest during pregnancy, but many of the other agents pose minimal risk as long as they are withdrawn during early pregnancy. The risks and benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in women with compelling indications must be weighed individually. In hypertensive patients at a high risk for unplanned pregnancy, nifedipine should be considered due to literature supporting its safety during early pregnancy. Pravastatin is recommended for women with dyslipidemia who are using effective contraception because there have been no reports of birth defects with this statin when used during early pregnancy in humans and animals.",

Data on statin expenditures and consumption expresed in defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/TID), were taken from annual reports of Croatian Agency for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (HALMED). Data on crude mortality rates and standardized cardiovascular mortality rates, were taken from the Croatian Health Statistics Yearbooks. The utilization of statins increased by 196.7% during the observed period, with the highest consumption of atorvastatin and simvastatin. Financial expenditure of statins expanded at much faster rate in comparison with overall drug costs. Cardiovascular mortality rates decreased slightly, while maintaining higher level in comparison with some neighbouring countries.",

    "120": "A number of clinical trials have shown that a high loading dose of atorvastatin (Ator) within 24h before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) exerts protective effects on the cardiovascular system. However, the potential mechanisms regarding this rapid benefit of Ator remain elusive. Our study introduced three different ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) models: I/R in vivo, I/R in vitro and oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R) in primary neonatal rat cardiac myocytes to observe the protective effect of a single loading dose of Ator pre-treatment and further to explore the potential mechanisms of this protective effect with confocal laser scanning microscopy, flow cytometry, biochemical and morphology methods. We found that the pre-treatment of high-dose Ator decreased the cardiac injury and maintained the integrity of mitochondria in all three of the I/R models, which was similar to ischaemic pre-conditioning (IPC). We used the mitochondrial K(ATP) channels (mitoKATP channels) inhibitor 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opener lonidamine (LND) to analyse the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that the pre-treatment of Ator significantly decreased I/R-induced injury, and maintained the functional integrity of mitochondria through alleviating Ca(2+) overload, reactive oxygen species burst, inhibiting the opening of mPTP and preventing mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) depolarisation. The present results demonstrated that a single dose of Ator might protect the myocardium from I/R-induced injury by inhibiting the mPTP opening through activating the mitoKATP channels. This result may contribute toward the development of novel strategies for clinical cardioprotection against I/R injury.", 
    "121": "The use of statins for cardiovascular disease prevention is clearly supported by clinical evidence. However, in January 2014 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released an advice on statin risk reporting that \"statin benefit is indisputable, but they need to be taken with care and knowledge of their side effects\". Among them the by far most common complication is myopathy, ranging from common but clinically benign myalgia to rare but life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. This class side effect appears to be dose dependent, with more lipophilic statin (i.e., simvastatin) carrying a higher overall risk. Hence, to minimize statin-associated myopathy, clinicians should take into consideration a series of factors that potentially increase this risk (i.e., drug-drug interactions, female gender, advanced age, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency). Whenever it is appropriate to stop statin treatment, the recommendations are to stay off statin until resolution of symptoms or normalization of creatine kinase values. Afterwards, clinicians have several options to treat dyslipidemia, including the use of a lower dose of the same statin, intermittent non-daily dosing of statin, initiation of a different statin, alone or in combination with nonstatin lipid-lowering agents, and substitution with red yeast rice.",

In the binding process of lovastatin with ct-DNA, the enthalpy change (\u0394H(0)) and entropy change (\u0394S(0)) were -24.9 kJ/mol and -12.0 J/mol/K, respectively, indicating that the main binding interaction forces were van der Waal's force and hydrogen bonding. The molecular docking results suggested that lovastatin preferred to bind on the minor groove of different B-DNA fragments and the conformation change of lovastatin in the lovastatin-DNA complex was obviously observed, implying that the flexibility of lovastatin molecule plays an important role in the formation of the stable lovastatin-ct-DNA complex.",

The formation of new bone was evaluated with digital direct radiography, computed tomography (CT), and histomorphometric analyses. New bone formed in all rabbits, but more formed in the experimental group according to histomorphometric variables. However, other measurements did not differ significantly between the groups. The new design of the periosteal distraction device was successful in causing new bone to form. Local simvastatin made no significant contribution to the procedure.",

We prospectively examined plasma lipids and statin use in relation to PD in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Statin use and plasma lipids were assessed at baseline (visit 1, 1987-89) and at three triennial visits thereafter (visits 2-4) until 1998. Potential PD cases were identified from multiple sources and validated where possible. The primary analysis was limited to incident PD cases diagnosed between 1998 and 2008. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were derived from multivariate logistic regression models. Statin use was rare at baseline (0.57%) but increased to 11.2% at visit 4. During this time frame, total-cholesterol levels decreased, particularly among statin users. Fifty-six PD cases were identified after 1998. Statin use before 1998 was associated with significantly higher PD risk after 1998 (odds ratio\u2009=\u20092.39, 95% confidence interval 1.11-5.13) after adjusting for total cholesterol and other confounders. Conversely, higher total cholesterol was associated with lower risk for PD after adjustment for statin usage and confounders.

    "133": "Atherosclerosis is characterized by the formation of cholesterol-loaded macrophages, which are turned into foam cells, the hallmark of early atherogenesis. As part of ongoing research on the interactions among human carotid lesion components and blood elements, the effect of plaque homogenate on macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis rate was examined. Human carotid plaques were ground, extracted with phosphate-buffered saline (homogenate), and then added to the macrophage medium. This extract decreased macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis rate up to 50% in a dose-dependent manner. Cholesterol or lipoproteins were separated from the homogenate and added to the MQ medium. Unlike the homogenate, neither free cholesterol nor the lipoproteins were able to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis rate under the above experimental concentration, suggesting that the homogenate-induced cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition in our experimental system was not owing to the feedback inhibition of cholesterol. Furthermore, the homogenate remaining after lipoprotein removal (lipoprotein-deficient homogenate) also decreased cholesterol biosynthesis rate, whereas boiled homogenate or phospholipids extracted from the homogenate decreased macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis rate only partially. Finally, cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition was achieved only upon using the precursor [(3)H]acetate, but not [(14)C]mevalonate, suggesting that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoA Reductase), the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, is involved in the above antiatherogenic effect of the homogenate, whereas the treatment with homogenate decreased HMGCoA Reductase mRNA. Proteins and phospholipids from human carotid lesion homogenate decrease cholesterol biosynthesis rate in macrophages secondary to HMGCoA Reductase feedback regulation. Such an effect may delay foam cell formation and atherosclerosis progression.",

Managing modifiable risk factors (e.g., hyperlipidemia, hypertension) remains the primary approach to prevent ASCVD events and ASCVD-related mortality. Statins are generally considered one of the most effective approaches to reduce ASCVD risk, especially for secondary prevention, yet remain underutilized in older adults. The evidence to support statin therapy in older adults is less robust than in their younger counterparts, especially in individuals aged 75 years and older. Recent lipid guidelines have raised this concern, yet statin therapy is recommended in 'at risk' older adults. Determining which older adults should receive statin therapy for primary prevention of ASCVD is challenging, as the currently available risk estimation tools are of limited use in those aged over 75 years. Furthermore, non-statin therapies have been de-emphasized in recent clinical practice guidelines and remain understudied in the older adult population. This is unfortunate given that older adults are less likely to tolerate moderate- to high-intensity statins. Non-statin therapies could be viable options in this population if more was understood about their ability to lower ASCVD risk and safety profiles. Nevertheless, lipid-lowering agents remain an integral component of the overall strategy to reduce atherogenic burden in older adults. Future research in this area should aim to enroll more older adults in clinical trials, determine the utility of ASCVD risk estimation for primary prevention, and investigate the role of non-statin therapies in this population.",

In the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL) trial (atorvastatin 80 mg vs simvastatin 20 to 40 mg), the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial (atorvastatin 80 vs 10 mg), the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial (atorvastatin 80 mg vs placebo), and the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT), and the Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (ASPEN) (atorvastatin 10 mg vs placebo), lipid changes on treatment were compared between genders with studies grouped by dose. The association of on-study low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and CV events by gender was evaluated in the combined studies and the impact of gender on adverse events in each study separately. Major CV events occurred in 3,083 of 30,000 men (10.3%) and 823 of 9,173 women (9.0%). Changes in lipids were similar in women and men. Major CV events were associated with gender-specific quintiles of on-treatment LDL cholesterol for women and men. In women, LDL cholesterol was a significant predictor of stroke, but not in men. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were higher in women in 4 of 6 trials, but in only 1 trial was a significant treatment-gender interaction seen. Myalgia rates were slightly higher in women in both statin and placebo groups. In conclusion, the response of women to atorvastatin was similar to that of men, with slightly more discontinuations due to adverse events. Higher on-treatment LDL cholesterol was significantly associated with more CV events in both genders, but the association was stronger for stroke in women and for coronary heart disease death in men.", 
    "140": "Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins are the cornerstone of therapy for the treatment of elevated LDL-C and for the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD. However, some patients are intolerant of statins or are unable to achieve acceptable lipid levels on statin-based regimens alone. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) serves as an important regulator of hepatocyte LDL receptor expression and degradation, and recent genetic studies have highlighted the critical role of PCSK9 in human disease. Gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, whereas loss-of-function mutations are protective against ASCVD. Therefore, PCSK9 inhibition offers a promising supplement or alternative to statin therapy in the reduction of LDL-C. Numerous phase II and III randomized control trials have demonstrated the tolerability of monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 and their efficacy in lowering LDL-C by an additional 40-70\u00a0%. In this article, we review the growing role of PSCK9 inhibition in LDL-C reduction for diverse patient populations.",

In this study SHRs were randomly divided into three groups (n=10 per group): SHR group, H-Rv group (rosuvastatin 2.5 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1)), L-Rv group (rosuvastatin 0.5 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1)), and 10 male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats in the control group (WKY group). All rats were treated with rosuvastatin for 12 weeks. The systolic blood pressure (SBP), left ventricle weight index (LVWI) and plasma lipids were measured during or after treatment. The expression of CYP4A1 mRNA and protein in different tissues was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot. In the heart, kidney and aorta, the CYP4A1 expressions were down-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in rosuvastatin-treated groups compared with the untreated SHR group (P<0.05 or P<0.01), and high-dose rosuvastatin exerted a stronger down-regulatory effect. The increasing trend of blood pressure was markedly blunted in the rosuvastatin-treated groups versus the untreated SHR group, and a stronger effect was observed in high-dose group (P<0.05 and P<0.01 at different time points). LVWI, an indicator of ventricle hypertrophy, was improved in the high-dose group compared with the untreated SHR group (P<0.05). The plasma concentrations of TC, TG and LDL-C in three SHR groups (high-dose, low-dose and untreated group) were all significantly lower than those of WKY group (P<0.05 or P<0.01), which seemed unrelated to the treatment of rosuvastatin. These findings suggested that hypertension in SHRs was possibly associated with CYP4A1 overexpression, and the effects of rosuvastatin on blood pressure and ventricle hypertrophy were potentially correlated with CYP4A1 and its metabolite other than lipid profiles. Multiple mechanisms are likely involved in the beneficial effects of statins with respect to the regulation of CYP4A1.",

These cardio-protective effects are mediated through inhibition of the intracellular mevalonate pathway, by decreasing isoprenoid intermediate synthesis and the subsequent post-translational modification of small GTPases, such as Ras, Rho, and Rac. Impaired intracellular calcium handling is considered an important pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for cardiac dysfunction. Our study aimed at investigating the influence of mevalonate pathway, including its downstream small GTPases (Ras, RhoA, and Rac1) on anoxia-mediated alterations of calcium handling in H9c2 cardiomyocytes. Cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes were exposed to acute anoxia after pretreatment with different drugs that specifically antagonize five key components in the mevalonate pathway, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, Rho-kinase, Rac1 and Ras farnesyltransferase. Thereafter, we evaluated the effects of the mevalonate pathway on anoxia-induced cell death, expression of the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor 2) and its regulator FK506-binding protein 12.6, as well as functional calcium release from intracellular calcium stores. Our experiments confirmed the role of prenylated proteins in regulating cardiomyocyte dysfunction, especially via RhoA- and Ras-related signaling pathways. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway could ameliorate anoxia-mediated calcium handling dysfunction with the up-regulated expression of FK506-binding protein 12.6 and consequently provided evidence for FK506-binding protein 12.6 as a \"stabilizer\" of ryanodine receptor 2.",

We enrolled 75 patients with inflammatory myopathies, who were all negative for anti-signal recognition particle and anti-aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase antibodies. They were referred to Keio University and National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry between October 2010 and September 2012. We also studied 251 patients with MG who were followed at the MG Clinic at Keio University Hospital. Anti-HMGCR antibodies were detected by ELISA. We investigated demographic, clinical, radiological, and histological findings associated with anti-HMGCR antibodies. We established the anti-HMGCR ELISA with the recombinant protein. Protein immunoprecipitation detected autoantigens corresponding to HMGCR. Immunohistochemistry using muscle biopsy specimens revealed regenerating muscle fibers clearly stained by polyclonal anti-HMGCR antibodies and patients' serum. Anti-HMGCR autoantibodies were specifically detected in 8 patients with necrotizing myopathy. The seropositivity rate in the necrotizing myopathy patients was significantly higher than those in the patients with other histological diagnoses of inflammatory myopathies (31% vs 2%, P\u200a=\u200a0.001). Statins were administered in only 3 of the 8 anti-HMGCR-positive patients. Myopathy associated with anti-HMGCR antibodies showed mild limb weakness and favorable response to immunotherapy. All 8 patients exhibited increased signal intensities on short T1 inversion recovery of muscle MRI. Of the 251 patients with MG, 23 were administered statins at the onset of MG.

The key factor influencing the cultivation of any filamentous species is fungal morphology and that is why this aspect was treated as the starting point for further considerations. Fungal morphology is known to have an impact on the following issues connected with the cultivation of A. terreus reviewed in this article. These are broth viscosity in conjunction with non-Newtonian behaviour of the cultivation broths, and multistage oxygen transfer processes: from gas phase (air) to liquid phase (broth) and diffusion in the fungal agglomerates. The latest achievements concerning the controlling A. terreus morphology during lovastatin biosynthesis with the use of morphological engineering techniques were also reviewed. Last but not least, some attention was paid to the type of a bioreactor, its operational mode and kinetic modelling of lovastatin production by A. terreus.",

Because of his concerns about the development of atherosclerosis, higher doses of simvastatin than recommended by the doctor, were used by him. After five weeks of such therapy the central nervous system symptoms such as: memory loss, cognitive disorders, sleeplessness, nervousness were presented. It is probable that the mentioned above symptoms were caused by high doses of drug took by the patient, and increased in blood-brain barrier permeability caused by electromagnetic radiation which lasted for about eight years.",

Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor II (TGF-\u03b2RII) plays an important role in the regulation of proliferation and progression in cancer. Statins have been documented to exhibit anticancer and cancer chemopreventive properties. However, the effects and mechanisms of simvastatin on the development of lung cancer are still unclear. In the present study, quiescent A549 cells were treated in vitro with fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the presence or absence of simvastatin. MTT, Western blot, and real-time qPCR were used to detect cell viability, activation of ERK, and expression of TGF-\u03b2RII at the protein and RNA level. Our results demonstrated that simvastatin inhibited activation of ERK, downregulated expression of TGF-\u03b2RII, and suppressed A549 cell proliferation. Furthermore, the effects of simvastatin can be reversed by farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Therefore, these results suggest that simvastatin may inhibit A549 cell proliferation and downregulate TGF-\u03b2RII expression by inhibiting activation of ERK. Our findings may advance the current understanding of the effects of simvastatin on cancer progression and contribute to the study of cancer treatment.",

Recent studies have demonstrated the beneficial role of atorvastatin in ACS; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been fully clarified. Growing evidence indicates that activation of the lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) plays an important role in oxidative stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis during ACS. In this study, we examined whether atorvastatin inhibits H2O2-induced LOX-1 expression and H9c2 cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and investigated the underlying signaling pathway. Treatment of H9c2 cardiomyocytes with H2O2 resulted in elevated expression of LOX-1 mRNA and protein, as well as increased caspase-3 and -9 protein expression and cell apoptosis. H2O2-induced LOX-1 expression, caspase protein expression, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were attenuated by pretreatment with atorvastatin. Atorvastatin activated H2O2-inhibited phosphorylation of Akt in a concentration-dependent manner. The Akt inhibitor, LY294002, inhibited the effect of atorvastatin on inducing Akt phosphorylation and on suppressing H2O2-mediated caspase up-regulation and cell apoptosis. These findings indicate that atorvastatin protects cardiomyocyte from oxidative stress via inhibition of LOX-1 expression and apoptosis, and that activation of H2O2-inhibited phosphorylation of Akt may play an important role in the protective function of atorvastatin.",

Macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1) is crucially involved in the development of osteolytic bone lesions in MM. We previously reported that minodronate inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced MIP-1\u03b1 secretion in mouse myeloma cells. However, it remains unknown whether bisphosphonates and statins inhibit MIP-1\u03b1 secretion by human MM cells. In present study, we investigated whether bisphosphonates and statins had any inhibitory effect on MIP-1\u03b1 secretion by human myeloma cells and the mechanism underlying this effect. In this study, we found that bisphosphonates and statins inhibited MIP-1\u03b1 mRNA and MIP-1\u03b1 secretion and suppressed extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt phosphorylation by inhibiting Ras prenylation. Moreover, bisphosphonates and statins suppressed the expression of acute myeloid leukemia-1A (AML-1A) mRNA, a MIP-1\u03b1 transcription factor. These results indicate that bisphosphonates and statins suppress the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ERK/AML-1A and Ras/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt/AML-1A pathways, thereby inhibiting MIP-1\u03b1 secretion by MM cells. Therefore, use of MIP-1\u03b1 expression inhibitors such as bisphosphonates and statins may provide a new therapeutic approach to inhibiting tumour progression and bone destruction in MM patients.",

The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether low Q10 levels in serum could be used as a marker to predict the risk of developing statin-induced myopathy. The secondary aim was to compare the change in Q10 levels during statin treatment and differences between men and women. Serum samples from a prospective, observational study in statin-treated patients who were thoroughly followed regarding muscular symptoms were used. In this cohort, 16 developed myopathy and 126 had no muscular symptoms related to statin treatment. Q10 levels were measured with a novel LC-MS method at baseline and after 2\u00a0months of statin treatment. Q10 levels showed no correlation with the risk of developing statin-induced myopathy. Individuals with low levels, Q10\u00a0<\u00a0200\u00a0ng/ml, at baseline had no increased risk of developing myopathy. In consistence with earlier reports, we showed that Q10 levels were reduced by 30% during statin treatment. There was no significant difference in the reduction between patients with or without myopathy. Women had approximately 30% lower Q10 levels compared to men both before and after treatment. In this study, there was no association between Q10 levels at baseline and statin-induced muscular side effects during a 2-month follow-up period, and our results indicate that Q10 levels in serum is not a useful marker to predict statin-induced myopathy.",

Never was it made for lovastatin producer Aspergillus terreus ATCC20542. Thus, this work is a quantitative study of oxygen transfer into A. terreus pellets during lovastatin biosynthesis in the shake flask culture. The basic measurement tool was an oxygen microprobe allowing for obtaining oxygen concentration profiles in the pellets. The pellets of various sizes from 1,600 to 6,400\u00a0\u03bcm exerting different oxygen transfer conditions were studied. Also various initial concentrations of carbon source were applied to change the conditions of biological reaction running in the pellets. Effective diffusivities in A. terreus pellets ranged from 643 to 1,342\u00a0\u03bcm\u00a0s(-1) dependent on their size and structure. It occurred that only the smallest pellets of diameter equal to about 1,400\u00a0\u03bcm were fully penetrated by oxygen. What is more, apart from the size of pellets, the appropriate lactose concentration was required to effectively produce lovastatin. Its value was correlated with oxygen concentration on the surface of the pellet and could not be either too high, as the aforementioned oxygen level tended then to zero, or too low, as despite high oxygen concentration no biological reaction ran in the pellet and no lovastatin was formed.",

The other risk factors of skin toxicity are the increase of breast size (P<0.001), a high body mass index (P<0.001), hypertension (P=0.03) and concurrent administration of trastuzumab (P=0.07). In multivariate analysis, the two remaining significant factors are breast size (OR=1.004 [1.002; 1.006]) and trastuzumab administration (OR=4.95 [1.17; 20.79]).", 
    "220": "The comparison of the skin toxicity induced by the presegmentation or the reference technique shows a trend regarding the improvement of the skin tolerance when using the presegmentation technique, thus pleading in favour of its use considering its dosimetric interest and the improvement of radioprotection of the patient. The next step will consist to experiment the simultaneous boost on tumoural bed using this technique.", 
    "221": "Many young adults with moderate hyperlipidemia do not meet statin treatment criteria under the new American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology cholesterol guidelines because they focus on 10-year cardiovascular risk. We evaluated the association between years of exposure to hypercholesterolemia in early adulthood and future coronary heart disease (CHD) risk.", 
    "222": "We examined Framingham Offspring Cohort data to identify adults without incident cardiovascular disease to 55 years of age (n=1478), and explored the association between duration of moderate hyperlipidemia (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol \u2265 160 mg/dL) in early adulthood and subsequent CHD. At median 15-year follow-up, CHD rates were significantly elevated among adults with prolonged hyperlipidemia exposure by 55 years of age: 4.4% for those with no exposure, 8.1% for those with 1 to 10 years of exposure, and 16.5% for those with 11 to 20 years of exposure (P<0.001); this association persisted after adjustment for other cardiac risk factors including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at 55 years of age (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.85 per decade of hyperlipidemia). Overall, 85% of young adults with prolonged hyperlipidemia would not have been recommended for statin therapy at 40 years of age under current national guidelines. However, among those not considered statin therapy candidates at 55 years of age, there remained a significant association between cumulative exposure to hyperlipidemia in young adulthood and subsequent CHD risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.64).", 
    "223": "Cumulative exposure to hyperlipidemia in young adulthood increases the subsequent risk of CHD in a dose-dependent fashion. Adults with prolonged exposure to even moderate elevations in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have elevated risk for future CHD and may benefit from more aggressive primary prevention.", 
    "224": "To report the safety, efficacy of anterior pulmonary vein vestibule intensive ablation and upstream therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF).", 
    "225": "AF patients (n = 59) undergone radiofrequency ablation were enrolled. The paroxysmal AF patients underwent circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI). The persistent AF patients underwent CPVI plus linear ablation. During CPVI, the anterior pulmonary vein vestibule was performed intensively by prolonging the ablation time and increasing the ablation energy.Rosuvastatin and telmisartan were used for upstream therapy. The patients underwent follow-up at 1 month after ablation, and then at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months to evaluating whether the procedure is valid and safety.", 
    "226": "During the 12 \u00b1 6.5 months follow-up, the success rate of combination therapy was 86.4%. Preoperative and postoperative left atrial diameter was (45 \u00b1 7) mm, and (41 \u00b1 5) mm (P < 0.05), left atrial emptying fraction before operation was 46% \u00b1 4%, and 54% \u00b1 5% after operation (P < 0.05).", 
    "227": "Combination therapy is valid and safety to treat AF. The results of 12 months follow-up showed left atrial diameter was decreased and left atrial emptying fraction was increased.", 
    "228": "To evaluate the effects of statins on the short-term prognosis in elderly patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).", 
    "229": "The data of hospitalized elderly patients with AKI at our hospital from June 2010 to December 2011 were analyzed retrospectively. The etiology, characteristics, prognosis and relative risk factors were examined. They were divided into statin and non-statin groups according to whether or not statins were taken over 3 months before a diagnosis of AKI.", 
    "230": "For 377 cases of elderly patients with AKI, serum creatinine (Scr) tmax was around 7.8 days and 2.06 times of peak increased in the level of Scr to baseline. About 24.7% of those were complicated with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Renal function fully recovered within 3 months after AKI in 206 cases (54.6%) of elderly patients with AKI. The renal function recovery rate of patients in statin group (n = 145) was significantly higher than that of those in non-statin group (n = 232) (P < 0.01). And 121 case (32.1%) died within 3 months after AKI. At the end of 3 months after AKI, the doubling of Scr level in statin group was significantly lower than that in non-statin group (P < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis showed that risk factors of mortality within 3 months in elders with AKI were significantly associated with infection and concurrent MODS. The doubling of Scr level after AKI in elders was significantly associated with the level of Scr at a diagnosis of AKI, MODS and the history of chronic kidney disease. The risk of doubling in Scr level was significantly reduced in patients of statin group after AKI (P = 0.02, OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.24-0.9).", 
    "231": "The risks of death in elderly patients with AKI are associated with infection and concurrent MODS. Long-term use of statin in elderly patients can significantly reduce the risk of doubling Scr level in surviving patients.", 
    "232": "Metformin has shown promise for cancer prevention. Prior studies suggested that metformin might interact potential prostate cancer (PCa) prevention agents: finasteride and statins. This study assessed if concurrent use of statins or finasteride modified the long-term impact of metformin on PCa risk in men with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).", 
    "233": "The study cohort consisted of 71,999 men with T2DM seen in the Veteran Administration Health Care System, without prior cancer or liver diseases, nor prescription of thiazolidinediones or insulin between FY2003-FY2013. Cox proportional hazard analyses (adjusting for covariates and propensity scores of metformin use) were conducted to compare the hazard ratio (HR) of PCa associated with metformin use between statins or finasteride users and none users.", 
    "234": "Mean follow-up was 6.4\u00b12.8 years; 5.2% (N= 3,756) of the cohort subsequently received a PCa diagnosis. Both statins and finasteride significantly modified the impact of metformin on PCa incidence (p-value<0.001): HR's of PCa associated with metformin use were 0.89 (p-value=0.02) among non-statin/non-finasteride users, 0.73 (p-value<0.001) among statin users, and 1.42 (p-value<0.001) among finasteride users.", 
    "235": "Metformin was associated with reduced PCa risk in men with T2DM. This impact was enhanced by statins but reversed by finasteride. Metformin, statins, and finasteride are potential PCa prevention agents. The interaction of these drugs on PCa risk needs further confirmation in other cohorts. Our finding of differential impacts of metformin, statins, and finasteride (alone or in combination) on PCa risk is informative for treatment management in men at risk for PCa and T2DM.", 
    "236": "Statins are associated with muscle myalgia and myopathy, which probably reduce habitual physical activity. This is particularly relevant to older people who are less active, sarcopaenic and at increased risk of statin myalgia. We hypothesised that statin myalgia would be allied to impaired strength and work capacity in older people, and determined whether differences aligned with divergences in lean mass, protein turnover, insulin sensitivity and the molecular regulation of these processes. Knee extensor strength and work output during 30 maximal isokinetic contractions were assessed in healthy male volunteers, nine with no statin use (control 70.4 \u00b1 0.7 years) and nine with statin myalgia (71.5 \u00b1 0.9 years). Whole body and leg glucose disposal, muscle myofibrillar protein synthesis (MPS) and leg protein breakdown (LPB) were measured during fasting (\u22485 mU l(-1) insulin) and fed (\u224840 mU l(-1) insulin + hyperaminoacidaemia) euglyceamic clamps. Muscle biopsies were taken before and after each clamp. Lean mass, MPS, LPB and strength were not different but work output during the initial three isokinetic contractions was 19% lower (P < 0.05) in statin myalgic subjects due to a delay in time to reach peak power output. Statin myalgic subjects had reduced whole body (P = 0.05) and leg (P < 0.01) glucose disposal, greater abdominal adiposity (P < 0.05) and differential expression of 33 muscle mRNAs (5% false discovery rate (FDR)), six of which, linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, increased at 1% FDR. Statin myalgia was associated with impaired muscle function, increased abdominal adiposity, whole body and leg insulin resistance, and evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis."
