Under these regimes, patients co-pay a fraction of the difference between a drug's pharmacy retail price and a reference price that is set by the government. Reference prices are either externally (based on drug prices in other countries) or internally (based on domestic drug prices) determined. We study the effects of a change from external to internal reference pricing in Denmark in 2005. We find that the reform led to substantial reductions in retail prices, reference prices and patient co-payments as well as to sizable decreases in overall producer revenues and health care expenditures. The reform induced consumers to substitute away from branded drugs for which we estimate strong preferences. The increase in consumer welfare due to the reform therefore depends on whether or not we take perceived quality differences into account in its calculation.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of G on cell proliferation in culture in A549 cells and in vivo in those same tumor cells implanted in nude mice fed diets supplemented with 25, 50, and 75 mmol G/kg. We demonstrated that G caused a dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition of A549 cells and tumor growth in vivo along with an induction of apoptosis. Moreover, further in vivo assays indicated that G decreased the levels of 3-hydroxymethylglutarylcoenzyme-A reductase-the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterogenesis-in a dose-dependent manner along with cholesterogenesis and cholesterolemia in addition to reducing the amount of membrane-bound Ras protein. These results showed that the doses of G used in this work, though nontoxic to animals, clearly inhibited the mevalonate pathway, which is closely linked to cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in A549 tumors, but not in normal mouse-liver cells. Accordingly, we suggest that G displays significant antitumor activity and should be a promising candidate for cancer chemotherapy.",

Lomitapide is associated with significant gastrointestinal adverse effects and increases in hepatic fat levels. Lomitapide undergoes hepatic metabolism via cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 and interacts with CYP3A4 substrates including atorvastatin and simvastatin; dose adjustment is recommended when lomitapide is used concurrently with these agents. In patients receiving concomitant warfarin, the International Normalized Ratio (INR) should be closely monitored, as lomitapide use may increase INR values. The recommended initial dosage of lomitapide is 5 mg once daily, with subsequent upward dose adjustment at specified intervals according to tolerability. Lomitapide is contraindicated in patients with moderate-to-severe liver disease, patients with sustained abnormal liver function tests, patients taking strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, and pregnant patients.",

    "93": "In the past 15 years, major advances have been made in understanding the role of lipids in podocyte biology. First, susceptibility to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and glomerular disease is associated with an APOL1 sequence variant, is expressed in podocytes and encodes apolipoprotein L1, an important component of HDL. Second, acid sphingomyelinase-like phosphodiesterase 3b encoded by SMPDL3b has a role in the conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide and its levels are reduced in renal biopsy samples from patients with recurrent FSGS. Furthermore, decreased SMPDL3b expression is associated with increased susceptibility of podocytes to injury after exposure to sera from these patients. Third, in many individuals with membranous nephropathy, autoantibodies against the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) receptor, which is expressed in podocytes, have been identified. Whether these autoantibodies affect the activity of PLA2, which liberates arachidonic acid from glycerophospholipids and modulates podocyte function, is unknown. Fourth, clinical and experimental evidence support a role for ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 1-dependent cholesterol efflux, free fatty acids and glycerophospolipids in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. An improved understanding of lipid biology in podocytes might provide insights to develop therapeutic targets for primary and secondary glomerulopathies.", 
    "94": "Many epidemiological studies have strongly suggested an inverse correlation between dietary polyphenol consumption and reduced risks of cardiovascular diseases. Yellow rice wine is a Chinese specialty and one of the three most ancient wines in the world (Shaoxing rice wine, beer, and grape wine). There is a large amount of polyphenol substances in yellow rice wine. This experiment was designed to study the potential beneficial effects of yellow wine polyphenolic compounds (YWPC) from yellow rice wine on progression of atherosclerosis in vivo and to further explore its underlying mechanisms. Six-week-old male LDL-receptor-knockout mice were treated with high-fat diet to establish the mouse model with atherosclerosis. Animals received 10, 30, or 50 mg/kg per day of YWPC or 10 mg/kg per day rosuvastatin or water (vehicle) for 14 weeks. The results indicated that YWPC and rosuvastatin significantly decreased circulating total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Compared to the control group, the atherosclerosis lesion area in the rosuvastatin-intervention group and YWPC at doses of 10, 30, and 50 mg/kg per day intervention groups decreased by 74.14%, 18.51%, 40.09%, and 38.42%, respectively. YWPC and rosuvastatin decreased the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2, 9, whereas the expression of the endogenous inhibitors of these proteins, namely, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, 2, increased when compared to the control group. It can be concluded that the YWPC is similar to the benefic effects of rosuvastatin on cardiovascular system. These effects may be attributed to their anti-atherosclerotic actions by lowering lipid and modulating the activity and expression of MMP-2, 9 and TIMP-1, 2.", 
    "95": "We have recently reported the development of an efficient, whole-cell process for chemoenzymatic production of key chiral intermediates in statin synthesis by employing high-density Escherichia coli culture with the overexpressed deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA). The optically pure, 6-substituted cyclic hemiacetals can be used for the synthesis of atorvastatin, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin using further chemical steps. All of the synthetic routes established to date begin with a regiospecific oxidation of these lactol intermediates into the corresponding lactones, followed by several steps yielding 6-substituted, open-chain or lactonized derivatives which can be coupled by various approaches with the heterocyclic part of the statin molecule. Here we report for the first time the use of PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenases for a highly efficient, regioselective oxidation of artificial, derivatized aldohexoses, more specifically, the statin lactol intermediates. First, PQQ-dependent dehydrogenases of both soluble and membrane-bound type were characterized for their activity toward various DERA-derived lactols. Further, we describe a highly productive whole-cell system for oxidation of these 2,4-dideoxyaldopyranoses using a PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (Gcd) overexpressed in E. coli while taking advantage of the respiratory chain as the mediator of the electron transfer to oxygen. Finally, a two-step artificial biosynthetic pathway was developed by unleashing the intrinsic genetic potential of E. coli. The combined overexpression of the endogenous DERA and the membrane-bound, PQQ-dependent glucose dehydrogenase, the latter being coupled to the respiratory chain, allows direct biosynthesis of 6-substituted lactones in a highly productive, high-yield, cost-effective and industrially scalable process.", 
    "96": "Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder with combination of at least 1 clinical and 1 laboratory criterion as defined by the SAPPORO statement. Clinical criteria result from vascular thrombosis that can affect artery, venous, or small vessel in any tissue or organ. Arterial stenosis is a rare lesion involved in APS, affecting mainly renal or intracranial arteries. We reported a case of a 33-year-old woman with abdominal angina and high blood pressure (BP). Imaging showed tight, not calcified, and hypodense stenosis of mesenteric superior artery and left renal artery, and a thrombosis of the celiac trunk. Treatment was digestive rest followed by angioplasty and stenting of mesenteric and renal artery, anticoagulation, antiplatelet, and statin therapy. Normal BP and digestive function were obtained postoperatively. Biological tests showed a positive lupus anticoagulant at diagnosis and at 12\u00a0weeks, which allowed us to make the diagnosis of APS. Physiopathology of stenosis in APS remains unclear but suggests arterial wall partial thrombosis, accelerated atherosclerosis, and/or proliferation of smooth muscle cells. We recommend screening of arterial stenosis in patients with APS and arterial symptoms, and inversely, searching for APS in young patients with atypical arterial stenosis to allow optimal therapy.", 
    "97": "Statins may act on inflammatory responses, decreasing oxidative stress and also reducing brain inflammation in several brain disorders. Epileptogenesis is a process in which a healthy brain becomes abnormal and predisposed to generating spontaneous seizures. We previously reported that lovastatin could prevent neuroinflammation in pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). In this context, this study investigated the long-lasting effects of lovastatin on mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, interleukin-6) and the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hippocampus during epileptogenesis by immunohistochemistry and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the latent and chronic phases in the epilepsy model induced by pilocarpine in rats. For these purposes, four groups of rats were employed: saline (CONTROL), lovastatin (LOVA), pilocarpine (PILO), and pilocarpine plus lovastatin (PILO+LOVA). After pilocarpine injection (350mg/kg, i.p.), the rats were treated with 20mg/kg of lovastatin via an esophagic probe 2h after SE onset. All surviving rats were continuously treated during 15days, twice/day. The pilocarpine plus lovastatin group showed a significant decrease in the levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 during the latent phase and a decreased expression of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in the chronic phase when compared with the PILO group. Moreover, lovastatin treatment also induced an increased expression of the antiinflammatory cytokine, IL-10, in the PILO+LOVA group when compared with the PILO group in the chronic phase. Thus, our data suggest that lovastin may reduce excitotoxicity during epileptogenesis induced by pilocarpine by increasing the synthesis of IL-10 and decreasing proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus.",

The MTP inhibitor lomitapide is currently only licensed for familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia but the intestinal inhibitors may have a future, particularly in familial combined hyperlipidemia. The future will be most exciting.", 
    "101": "Statins are widely used as hypolipidemic drugs, and have beneficial effects in reducing cardiovascular events. In addition, recent studies on the pleiotropic effects of statins (i.e., simvastatin) reveal that these drugs have many additional anti-atherogenic effects, including antiplatelet activity. The mechanisms may be partly related to activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which are present in human platelets, and whose activation inhibits platelet aggregation. However, the details of the signaling pathway by which simvastatin inhibits platelet activation via PPARs have not yet been completely established. The aim of this study was to examine the mechanisms by which the PPAR-mediated pathways contribute to the antiplatelet activity of simvastatin. Simvastatin (3-50 \u03bcM) induced PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 activation in a dose-dependent manner in washed platelets. Additionally, simvastatin inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation, expression of CD62 and PAC-1, and Ca(2+) mobilization. These effects of simvastatin on platelet responses were strongly reduced by adding a selective PPAR\u03b3 antagonist (GW9662), but not PPAR\u03b1 antagonist (GW6471). Moreover, in the presence of GW9662, simvastatin-mediated increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) Ser(157) phosphorylation and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation were markedly reversed. Furthermore, simvastatin was found to inhibit phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs, i.e., p38 MAPK, ERK) by increasing the association between PPAR\u03b3 and the components of MAPKs after platelet activation. Taken together, the present results confirm that simvastatin inhibition of platelet activation is mediated by PPAR\u03b3-dependent processes, which involves mediating MAPKs signaling, increase of cAMP formation and VASP Ser(157) phosphorylation, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization.",

Detailed characterization of these models will help to better understand their utility for predicting clinical outcomes. To advance this approach, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of these mouse lines by evaluating the compensatory changes in mRNA expression, quantifying the amounts of OATP1B1 and -1B3 protein by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and studying the active uptake in isolated hepatocytes and the pharmacokinetics of some prototypical substrates including statins. Major outcomes from these studies were 1) mostly moderate compensatory changes in only a few genes involved in drug metabolism and disposition, 2) a robust hepatic expression of OATP1B1 and -1B3 proteins in the respective humanized mouse models, and 3) functional activities of the human transporters in hepatocytes isolated from the humanized models with several substrates tested in vitro and with pravastatin in vivo. However, the expression of OATP1B1 and -1B3 in the humanized models did not significantly alter liver or plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin and pitavastatin compared with Oatp1a/1b knockout controls under the conditions used in our studies. Hence, although the humanized OATP1B1 and -1B3 mice showed in vitro and/or in vivo functional activity with some statins, further characterization of these models is required to define their potential use and limitations in the prediction of drug disposition and drug-drug interactions in humans.",

    "131": "Co-amorphous drug mixtures with low-molecular-weight excipients have recently been shown to be a promising approach for stabilization of amorphous drugs and thus to be an alternative to the traditional amorphous solid dispersion approach using polymers. However, the previous studies are limited to a few drugs and amino acids. To facilitate the rational selection of amino acids, the practical importance of the amino acid coming from the biological target site of the drug (and associated intermolecular interactions) needs to be established. In the present study, the formation of co-amorphous systems using cryomilling and combinations of two poorly water-soluble drugs (simvastatin and glibenclamide) with the amino acids aspartic acid, lysine, serine, and threonine was investigated. Solid-state characterization with X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the 1:1 molar combinations simvastatin-lysine, glibenclamide-serine, and glibenclamide-threonine and the 1:1:1 molar combination glibenclamide-serine-threonine formed co-amorphous mixtures. These were homogeneous single-phase blends with weak intermolecular interactions in the mixtures. Interestingly, a favorable effect by the excipients on the tautomerism of amorphous glibenclamide in the co-amorphous blends was seen, as the formation of the thermodynamically less stable imidic acid tautomer of glibenclamide was suppressed compared to that of the pure amorphous drug. Furthermore, the co-amorphous mixtures provided a physical stability advantage over the amorphous drugs alone.",

    "133": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor gene (LDLR). Patients with homozygous FH (hoFH) have inherited a mutated LDLR gene from both parents, and therefore all their LDL-receptors are incapable of functioning normally. In hoFH, serum LDL levels often exceed 13 mmol/L and tendon and cutaneous xanthomata appear early (under 10 years of age). If untreated, this extremely severe form of hypercholesterolemia may cause death in childhood or in early adulthood. Based on recent data, it can be estimated that the prevalence of hoFH is about 1:500,000 or even 1:400,000. Until now, the treatment of hoFH has been based on high-dose statin treatment combined with LDL apheresis. Since the LDL cholesterol-lowering effect of statins is weak in this disease, and apheresis is a cumbersome treatment and not available at all centers, alternative novel pharmaceutical therapies are needed. Lomitapide is a newly introduced drug, capable of effectively decreasing serum LDL cholesterol concentration in hoFH. It inhibits the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP). By inhibiting in hepatocytes the transfer of triglycerides into very low density lipoprotein particles, the drug blocks their assembly and secretion into the circulating blood. Since the very low density lipoprotein particles are precursors of LDL particles in the circulation, the reduced secretion of the former results in lower plasma concentration of the latter. The greatest concern in lomitapide treatment has been the increase in liver fat, which can be, however, counteracted by strictly adhering to a low-fat diet. Lomitapide is a welcome addition to the meager selection of drugs currently available for the treatment of refractory hypercholesterolemia in hoFH patients.",

Regardless of dose, only 28.3%-34.8% of patients had LDL-C levels <1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL), and 72.0%-78.0% achieved LDL-C <2.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL) in both cohorts. As many as 41% and 13% of patients had LDL-C levels \u22650.5 mmol/L (\u226520 mg/dL) above LDL-C 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), respectively, in both cohorts; these percentages were generally similar across atorvastatin doses.", 
    "137": "In this real-world US setting, a large number of high-risk CVD patients did not attain guideline-recommended LDL-C levels with atorvastatin monotherapy. More than 65% of the patients had LDL-C levels >1.8 mmol/L (>70 mg/dL), and of these, 30%-40% had LDL-C levels \u22650.5 mmol/L (\u226520 mg/dL) above this, regardless of dose. This suggests that more effective lipid-lowering strategies, such as statin uptitration, switching to a higher efficacy statin, and/or combination therapy, may be required to achieve optimal LDL-C lowering in high-risk patients.",

The obtained results show the equivalent of hypolipidemia effectiveness of all investigated courses of statinotherapy with the benefit of rosuvastatin of 20 mg in increase of level of HDL cholesterol and combined statinotherapy with UDCA in decrease of level of triglycerides. It was confirmed the significant advantages of combined statinotherapy with UDCA as for the influence on functional state of liver and CRP level, and advantages of rosuvastatin of 10 mg in combination with UDCA. Thus, the combination of rosuvastatin of 10 mg with UDCA should be preferable in the treatment of patients with myocardial infarction in combination with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis from the positions of the effectiveness and safety. Besides, taking into account positive correlation between the CRP level in blood and activity of transaminases in the dynamics of observation it can be concluded that high activity of transaminases is the prognostic marker of the severity and procession of polymorbid pathology - myocardial infarction in combination with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.",

Lovastatin has been shown to effectively induce apoptosis in mouse PHEO cells (MPC) and the more aggressive mouse tumor tissue-derived cells (MTT), which was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) pathway players. The MAPK pathway plays a role in numerous aggressive tumors and has been associated with a subgroup of PHEOs/PGLs, including K-RAS-, RET-, and NF1-mutated tumors. Our aim was to establish whether MAPK signaling may also play a role in aggressive, succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) B mutation-derived PHEOs/PGLs. Expression profiling and western blot analysis indicated that specific aspects of MAPK-signaling are active in SDHB PHEOs/PGLs, suggesting that inhibition by statin treatment could be beneficial. Moreover, we aimed to assess whether the anti-proliferative effect of lovastatin on MPC and MTT differed from that exerted by fluvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, or rosuvastatin. Simvastatin and fluvastatin decreased cell proliferation most effectively and the more aggressive MTT cells appeared more sensitive in this respect. Inhibition of MAPK1 and 3 phosphorylation following treatment with fluvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin was confirmed by western blot. Increased levels of CASP-3 and PARP cleavage confirmed induction of apoptosis following the treatment. At a concentration low enough not to affect cell proliferation, spontaneous migration of MPC and MTT was significantly inhibited within 24 hours of treatment. In conclusion, lipophilic statins may present a promising therapeutic option for treatment of aggressive human paragangliomas by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting tumor spread.",

Ca-P coating alone cannot confer pro-osteodifferentiation and antibacterial capabilities on implants; however, it can serve as a carrier for biological agents which could improve the performance of implants and bone substitutes. Here, we constructed a novel, bi-functional Ca-P coating with combined pro-osteodifferentiation and antibacterial capabilities. Different concentrations of metronidazole (MNZ) and simvastatin (SIM) were integrated into biomimetic Ca-P coatings on the surface of titanium disks. The biological effects of this bi-functional biomimetic coating on human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs), human adipose derived stromal cells (hASCs), and Porphyromonas gingivalis were assessed in vitro. We observed that Ca-P coatings loaded with both SIM and MNZ display favorable release kinetics without affecting cell proliferation or attachment. In the inhibition zone test, we found that the bi-functional coating showed lasting antibacterial effects when incubated with Porphyromonas gingivalis for 2 and 4 days. Moreover, the osteodifferentiation of hBMMSCs and hASCs were increased when cultured on this bi-functional coating for 7 and 14 days. Both drugs were loaded onto the Ca-P coating at specific concentrations (10(-5) M SIM; 10(-2) M MNZ) to achieve optimal release kinetics. Considering the safety, stability and low cost of SIM and MNZ, this novel bi-functional Ca-P coating technique represents a promising method to improve the performance of metal implants or other bone substitute materials, and can theoretically be easily translated to clinical applications.",

Ultrahigh-resolution and high mass accuracy measurements on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-Orbitrap mass spectrometer allowed better detection of desired analytes in the background of matrix and endogenous compounds. Tandem mass spectra were also used to confirm the identification of detected metabolites in complex matrices. The optimization of sample preparation before imaging experiments included the tissue cryogenic sectioning (thickness 20 \u03bcm), the transfer to stainless steel or glass slide, and the selection of suitable matrix and its homogenous deposition on the tissue slice. Thirteen matrices typically used for small molecule analysis, e.g., 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (DAN), 9-aminoacridine (AA), etc., were investigated for the studied drug and its metabolite detection efficiency in both polarity modes. Particular matrices were scored based on the strength of extracted ion current (EIC), relative ratio of AT molecular adducts, and fragment ions. The matrix deposition on the tissue for the most suitable matrices was done by sublimation to obtain the small crystal size and to avoid local variations in the ionization efficiency. UHPLC/MS profiling of drug metabolites in adjacent tissue slices with the previously optimized extraction was performed in parallel to mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) measurements to obtain more detailed information on metabolites in addition to the spatial information from MSI. The quantitation of atorvastatin in rat liver, serum, and feces was also performed.", 
    "179": "To test the feasibility of preparing redispersible powders from nanosuspensions without further addition of drying protectants, Lovastatin was processed into nanosuspensions and subsequently converted into a powder form using a spray-drying process. The effects of spray-drying process parameters and stabilizers on the properties of the spray-dried powders were evaluated. The inlet air temperature was found to have the most pronounced impact; a low-inlet air temperature consistently yielded dried powders with improved redispersibility. This was attributed to the low Peclet number associated with a low-inlet air temperature, making nanoparticles less prone to aggregation and coalescence during spray drying, as evidenced by the well-defined boundary shown between nanoparticles in the SEM photomicrographs of the spray-dried microparticles. The influence of atomization pressure is significant particularly at a low-inlet air temperature. The redispersibility index value of the powder is dependent on the type of stabilizers used in the nanosuspension formulation. Spray-dried powders with acceptable redispersibility were prepared with drug concentration as high as 3%. In conclusion, with optimized process parameters and selected stabilizers, spray drying is a feasible process in the solidification of nanosuspensions with high drug loading and acceptable redispersibility.", 
    "180": "Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels using statins is associated with significant reductions in cardiovascular (CV) events in a wide range of patient populations. Although statins are generally considered to be safe, recent studies suggest they are associated with an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes (T2D). This led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to change their labelling requirements for statins to include a warning about the possibility of increased blood sugar and HbA1c levels and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to issue guidance on a small increased risk of T2D with the statin class. This review examines the evidence leading to these claims and provides practical guidance for primary care physicians on the use of statins in people with or at risk of developing T2D. Overall, evidence suggests that the benefits of statins for the reduction of CV risk far outweigh the risk of developing T2D, especially in individuals with higher CV risk. To reduce the risk of developing T2D, physicians should assess all patients for T2D risk prior to starting statin therapy, educate patients about their risks, and encourage risk-reduction through lifestyle changes. Whether some statins are more diabetogenic than others requires further study. Statin-treated patients at high risk of developing T2D should regularly be monitored for changes in blood glucose or HbA1c levels, and the risk of conversion from pre-diabetes to T2D should be reduced by intensifying lifestyle changes. Should a patient develop T2D during statin treatment, physicians should continue with statin therapy and manage T2D in accordance with relevant national guidelines.", 
    "181": "Lowering serum lipid levels is part of the foundation of treating and preventing clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Recently, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology released cholesterol guidelines which advocate for high efficacy statins rather than LDL-c goals for five patient subgroups at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is critical that clinicians have an approach for managing side-effects of statin therapy. Statins are associated with myopathy, transaminase elevations, and an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus among some patients; connections between statins and other processes, such as renal and neurologic function, have also been studied with mixed results. Statin-related adverse effects might be minimized by careful assessment of patient risk factors. Strategies to continue statin therapy despite adverse effects include switching to another statin at a lower dose and titrating up, giving intermittent doses of statins, and adding non-statin agents. Non-statin lipid-lowering drugs have their own unique limitations. Management strategies and algorithms for statin-associated toxicities are available to help guide clinicians. Clinical practice should emphasize tailoring therapy to address each individual's cholesterol goals and risk of developing adverse effects on lipid-lowering drugs.", 
    "182": "Dyslipoproteinaemia is a cardinal feature of the metabolic syndrome that accelerates atherosclerosis. It is characterized by high plasma concentrations of triglyceride-rich and apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins, with depressed high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and increased small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle concentrations. Dysregulation of lipoprotein metabolism in the metabolic syndrome may be due to a combination of overproduction of very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL) apoB, decreased catabolism of apoB-containing particles, and increased catabolism of HDL apoA-I particles. These abnormalities are due to a global metabolic effect of insulin resistance and visceral obesity. Lifestyle modifications (dietary restriction and increased exercise) and pharmacological treatments favourably alter lipoprotein transport by decreasing the hepatic secretion of VLDL-apoB and the catabolism of HDL apoA-I, as well as by increasing the clearance of LDL-apoB. The safety and tolerability of combination drug therapy based on statins is important and merits further investigation. There are several pipeline therapies for correcting triglyceride-rich lipoprotein and HDL metabolism. However, their clinical efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness remain to be demonstrated.", 
    "183": "The first observations linking a low serum level of HDL-C to increased risk for cardiovascular disease were made over 50 years ago. High serum levels of HDL-C appear to protect against the development of atherosclerotic disease, while low serum levels of this lipoprotein are among the most important predictors of atherosclerotic disease in both men and women and people of all racial and ethnic groups throughout the world. It has long been assumed that therapeutic interventions targeted at raising HDL-C levels would lower risk for such cardiovascular events as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and death. Even after five decades of intensive investigation, evidence to support this assumption has been fleeting. A number of post hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses suggest that HDL-C raising, particularly when coupled with aggressive LDL-C reduction, impacts risk for cardiovascular events and rates of progression of atherosclerotic disease. Unfortunately, four recent prospective trials performed with the intent of testing the \"HDL hypothesis\" (ILLUMINATE, dal-OUTCOMES, AIM-HIGH, and HPS2-THRIVE) failed to meet their primary composite endpoints. These results have lead many clinicians and investigators to question the validity of the assumption that HDL-C raising reduces risk for cardiovascular events. Additional trials with other drugs are underway. In the meantime, HDL-C cannot be considered a target of therapy. Given the complexity of the HDL proteome and lipidome, there is biological plausibility for how HDL particles might exert atheroprotection. We explore the evidence supporting the inverse relationship between HDL-C and cardiovascular disease risk, documented mechanisms by which HDL particles may exert atheroprotection, and the findings either supporting or negating specific therapeutic interventions in patients afflicted with low HDL-C.", 
    "184": "Lipid lowering, particularly with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (\"statins\"), reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. Patients with chronic liver and kidney disease present challenges to the use of lipid medications. In the case of most liver disorders, the concern has been one of safety. There is evidence that most lipid-lowering medications can be used safely in many situations, although large outcomes trials are not available. In contrast, in chronic kidney disease, dosing of lipid medications may require substantial modification depending on creatinine clearance. There are significant alterations in lipid metabolism in chronic kidney disease with concomitant increases in cardiovascular risk. Some data are available on cardiovascular outcomes with dyslipidemia treatment in renal patients. This review will examine lipid physiology and cardiovascular risk in specific liver and kidney diseases and review the evidence for lipid lowering and the use of statin and non-statin therapies in chronic liver and kidney disease.", 
    "185": "Considerable progress has been achieved in the treatment of dyslipidemias. However, half of cardiovascular events occur in individuals with average or low cholesterol levels and there is still a considerable residual risk with 70% of patients having an event despite statin treatment. In the era of personalized medicine there is increased interest in the incorporation of individual biomarkers in risk score algorithms in order to improve cardiovascular risk stratification followed by the prompt initiation of preventive measures. Since the 2001 third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment on High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III) several studies have evaluated the prognostic value of lipid related biomarkers such as non-HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio, lipoprotein(a), lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, and C-reactive protein.

Oral administration of pravastatin (a statin; 1-10 mg/kg/day) or olmesartan (an ARB; 1-10 mg/kg/day) dose-dependently inhibited the aortic calcification in parallel with their renoprotective, lipid-lowering and blood pressure-lowering effects. Of note, the lowest dose of pravastatin inhibited aortic calcification with no influence on the renal function, BP and cholesterol, suggesting that it has direct vasoprotective properties. Intriguingly, the combined administration of pravastatin and olmesartan at the lowest doses synergistically ameliorated the aortic calcification, and the protective effect was at least partly attributable to the inhibition of RF-induced apoptosis in the aortic wall. An in vitro model of inorganic phosphate (Pi)-induced vascular smooth muscle cell calcification mimicked these effects of pravastatin and olmesartan, and the beneficial effect of the combination was attributable to the inhibitory effects on Pi-induced apoptosis via the restoration of the Gas6/Axl-mediated anti-apoptotic pathway.", 
    "220": "A statin and an ARB exerted potent protective effects against vascular calcification due to CKD, probably through their pleiotropic effects. In addition, combination therapy with pravastatin and olmesartan may provide a new therapeutic strategy for the prevention of vascular calcification.", 
    "221": "Reported rates of local failure after adjuvant radiation for women with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and triple-negative non-IBC are higher than those of women with receptor-expressing non-IBC. These high rates of locoregional recurrence are potentially influenced by the contribution of radioresistant cancer stem cells to these cancers. Statins have been shown to target stem cells and improve disease-free survival among IBC patients. We examined simvastatin radiosensitization of multiple subtypes of breast cancer cell lines in vitro in monolayer and mammosphere-based clonogenic assays and examined the therapeutic benefit of statin use on local control after postmastectomy radiation (PMRT) among IBC patients. We found that simvastatin radiosensitizes mammosphere-initiating cells (MICs) of IBC cell lines (MDA-IBC3, SUM149, SUM190) and of the metaplastic, non-IBC triple-negative receptor cell line (SUM159). However, simvastatin radioprotects MICs of non-IBC cell lines MCF-7 and SKBR3. In a retrospective clinical study of 519 IBC patients treated with PMRT, 53 patients used a statin. On univariate analysis, actuarial 3-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was higher among statin users, and on multivariate analysis, triple negative breast cancer, absence of lymphatic invasion, neoadjuvant pathological tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy, and statin use were independently associated with higher LRFS. In conclusion, patients with IBC and triple-negative non-IBC breast cancer have the highest rates of local failure, and there are no available known radiosensitizers. We report significant improvement in local control after PMRT among statin users with IBC and significant radiosensitization across triple-negative and IBC cell lines of multiple subtypes using simvastatin. These data suggest that simvastatin should be justified as a radiosensitizing agent by a prospective clinical trial.", 
    "222": "A simple, environmentally friendly, and efficient method, based on hollow-fiber-supported liquid membrane microextraction, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography has been developed for the extraction and determination of amlodipine (AML) and atorvastatin (ATO) in water and urine samples. The AML in two-phase hollow-fiber liquid microextraction is extracted from 24.0 mL of the aqueous sample into an organic phase with microliter volume located inside the pores and lumen of a polypropylene hollow fiber as acceptor phase, but the ATO in three-phase hollow-fiber liquid microextraction is extracted from aqueous donor phase to organic phase and then back-extracted to the aqueous acceptor phase, which can be directly injected into the high-performance liquid chromatograph for analysis. The preconcentration factors in a range of 34-135 were obtained under the optimum conditions. The calibration curves were linear (R(2) \u2265 0.990) in the concentration range of 2.0-200 \u03bcg/L for AML and 5.0-200 \u03bcg/L for ATO. The limits of detection for AML and ATO were 0.5 and 2.0 \u03bcg/L, respectively. Tap water and human urine samples were successfully analyzed for the existence of AML and ATO using the proposed methods."
