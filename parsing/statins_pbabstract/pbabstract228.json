Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered daily, for 15 days, with either rosuvastatin (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg) or probenecid (100 mg/kg) alone, or with a combination of rosuvastatin (50, 100 or 200 mg/kg) and probenecid (100 mg/kg). Skeletal muscle toxicity was elevated with probenecid administered with 200 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin, with the elevation of creatine kinase by 12-fold, alanine aminotrasferase by 10-fold and creatinine by 9-fold at day 15, with no adverse effects observed when probenecid was given alone. Mitochondria ultrastructural damage with enlargement, disruption, cristolysis and vaculation was seen in the soleus and plantaris of animals administered with probenecid and high dosages of statin. These muscles were also expressing more succinic dehydrogenase (SDH)-positive and cytochrome oxidase (CyOX)-positive fibers. Although generally well-tolerated, statins produce a variety of adverse skeletal muscle events. Hydrophilic statins, with reduced levels of non-specific passive diffusion rates into extra-hepatic tissues, are still seen to produce myopathy. This highlights the important roles of transport mechanisms in statin transport at the skeletal muscles. Excessive influx, reduced efflux or the combination of the two could result in elevated cellular levels of statins at the skeletal muscles, resulting in toxicity. This study provides preliminary evidence that the MRP-1 transporter and efflux at skeletal muscles possibly play significant roles in statin-induced myopathy.", 
    "1": "Statins are known to lessen the severity of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. The present study was undertaken to define the mechanism of renoprotective actions of statins using a mouse kidney injury model. Treatment of mice with pravastatin, a widely used statin, improved renal function after renal ischemia-reperfusion without lowering the plasma cholesterol level. Administration of pravastatin with mevalonate, a product of HMG-CoA reductase, eliminated renal protection suggesting an effect of pravastatin on mevalonate or its metabolism. In hypercholestrolemic apolipoprotein E knockout mice with reduced HMG-CoA reductase activity; the degree of injury was less severe than in control mice, however, there was no protective action of pravastatin on renal injury in the knockout mice. Treatment with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor (L-744832) mimicked pravastatin's protective effect but co-administration with the statin provided no additional protection. Both pravastatin and L-744832 inhibited the injury-induced increase in plasma IL-6 concentration to a similar extent. Our results suggest the protective effect of pravastatin on renal ischemia-reperfusion injury is mediated by inhibition of the mevalonate-isoprenoid pathway independent of its lipid lowering action.", 
    "2": "Statins have been identified as a potentially interesting treatment against sepsis. Here, we study the vascular reactivity of aortae from rats treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 4 mg . kg(-1), following chronic administration of simvastatin (SV) 10 mg . kg(-1).", 
    "3": "The rats were treated with either vehicle or SV for 4 weeks before administration of LPS. After 18 h, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using a tail cuff and vascular and endothelial responses of aortic rings to several agonists were studied in an organ bath.", 
    "4": "LPS injection decreased the SBP by 38 mm Hg and vascular response to phenylephrine (Phe) by 60%. Plasma nitrates and nitrites (NO(x)) were 3-fold higher after LPS. This attenuated response to Phe was prevented by incubation with either the inducible-nitric-oxide-synthase (iNOS)-selective inhibitor 1400W or the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/iNOS nonselective blocker L-NAME. The presence of endothelium did not alter these findings. Administering LPS to SV-treated rats also decreased the SBP and increased the NO(x) concentration. The impaired response to Phe was restored by blocking NO synthesis in endothelium-denuded but not in intact aortic rings. The response to acetylcholine demonstrated an enhanced reduction in arteries from the SV + LPS group compared with the LPS group. The inhibition of iNOS prevented acetylcholine-induced relaxation in rings from LPS-treated rats but not in those from the SV + LPS group.", 
    "5": "These results suggest that statins may reduce iNOS-mediated NO production in endothelial but not in vascular smooth-muscle cells.", 
    "6": "Increasing evidence indicated that plaque stabilization is attributed to the composition of the atherosclerotic plaque, and inflammation plays an important role in the formation and progress of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque (VAP), which is prone to rupture. Emodin, an important component of traditional Chinese herb rhubarb, has obvious anti-inflammatory effect, although its effect on atherosclerotic plaque stabilization is unknown. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is an important component of plasma lipoprotein with anti-atherosclerosis function, and the plaque in the aorta of ApoE-deficient mice has been demonstrated with characteristics of VAP. Therefore, this study was designed to determine whether emodin can stabilize the VAP in the ApoE-deficient mice and explain the possible mechanism. After fat-fed for 13 weeks, mice were randomized into three groups (11 animals/group) and intragastrically administrated with emodin, simvastatin or distilled water for 13 weeks, respectively. The plaque stability was evaluated by the morphology and composition of atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, the expression of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in plaques was determined by the immunohistochemistry method. We showed that emodin could decrease the lipid core area and the ratio of lipid to collagen content in plaques. In addition, emodin significantly inhibited the expression of GM-CSF and MMP-9, whereas it induced the expression of PPAR-gamma in plaques. In conclusion, these results suggest that emodin can stabilize the VAP in the aortic root of ApoE-knockout mice, which is probably due to its anti-inflammatory effect.",

    "8": "Twelve men with the metabolic syndrome were studied in a randomized double-blind crossover trial of 5-week intervention periods with placebo, 10 mg rosuvastatin, or 40 mg rosuvastatin, with 2-week placebo washouts between each period. VLDL apoC-III kinetics were examined using a stable isotope method and compartmental modeling at the end of each intervention period.", 
    "9": "Compared with placebo, there was a significant dose-dependent reduction with rosuvastatin in plasma triglyceride and VLDL apoC-III concentrations. Rosuvastatin significantly (P < 0.05) increased VLDL apoC-III fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and decreased its production rate, with a significant (P < 0.05) dose-related effect. With 40 mg rosuvastatin, changes in VLDL apoC-III concentration were inversely associated with changes in VLDL apoC-III FCR and positively associated with VLDL apoC-III production rate (P < 0.05). Changes in VLDL apoC-III concentration and production rate were positively correlated with changes in VLDL apoB concentration and production rate and inversely correlated with VLDL apoB FCR (P < 0.05). Similar associations were observed with 10 mg rosuvastatin but were either less or not statistically significant.", 
    "10": "In this study, rosuvastatin decreased the production and increased the catabolism of VLDL apoC-III, a mechanism that accounted for the significant reduction in VLDL apoC-III and triglyceride concentrations. This has implications for the management of cardiometabolic risk in obese subjects with the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "11": "Retrospective studies show that statin use prevents congestive heart failure and decreases mortality in patients with congestive heart failure; however, only one prospective study is available. In the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure study, rosuvastatin (10 mg/d) was compared with placebo in patients with advanced coronary heart disease-related congestive heart failure. There was no significant difference between rosuvastatin and placebo except for hospitalization rates. Statins must be given to all patients with coronary heart disease as early as possible because they may not work in patients with advanced congestive heart failure.", 
    "12": "Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is a strong risk predictor of cardiovascular events, and tissue factor (TF) plays a central role in thrombus formation of advanced atherosclerotic plaques. Aim of the present study was to quantify in situ CRP and TF in coronary atherectomy specimens associated with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or stable angina (SA). In addition, the effect of statin treatment on both intimal determinants was analyzed.", 
    "13": "Serial sections from atherectomy probes retrieved from coronary primary target lesions of 42 ACS and 70 SA patients were examined for CRP and TF expression using immunostaining. CRP and TF intimal expression was consistently higher in ACS lesions and a positive correlation between both determinants was detected. In both subgroups intimal staining intensity of CRP but not TF was strongly associated with serum CRP levels. Using angioscopy, complex plaques revealed a higher intimal CRP and TF expression than white/yellow plaques. Both CRP and TF were consistently lower expressed in target lesions of patients with pre-existing statin treatment.",

    "15": "Statins, as efficient HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A) reductase inhibitors are widely used in the management of cardiovascular diseases. Interactions in aqueous solutions between highly lipophilic statins and cyclodextrins (CDs) in the absence and the presence of a dissolved polymer or its monomeric compound, respectively, were studied. The solubility of lovastatin and simvastatin at various temperatures and pHs were investigated by phase-solubility measurements. Surface activity of solutes in binary (CD-statin) and ternary (CD-statin-polymer) systems was studied by determining the surface tension of the solutions. For the characterization of the CD-statin inclusion complexes, stability constants for associates of different molar ratios have been calculated. It was shown that complexation may lead to improvement of the aqueous solubilities of both statins by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Especially, randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin (RAMEB) showed outstanding solubilizing effects. In binary systems dominantly CD-statin associates of 1:1 molar ratios form, which exhibit considerable surface activity. RAMEB forms more stable complexes with these drugs than the native beta-CD, and also the surface activity of the former solutes is higher. In polymer-containing ternary systems the solubility of both statins could be further improved. The enhanced drug solubilities can be ascribed to the formation of CD-statin-polymer associates with supramolecular structure. A portion of the surface active CD-statin complexes are very likely anchored at the macromolecular chains. In these solutions, the total amounts of solutes are composed of the sum of the \"free\" binary and the supramolecular ternary associates.",

Both groups were matched with respect to age, gender, body mass indices and lipid levels. Flow- mediated dilatation (endothelium dependent, FMD) and nitroglycerine-induced dilatation (endothelium independent, NID) were measured in the brachial artery using high-resolution ultrasound in all participants and carotid artery intima media thickness (IMT) were also evaluated. OxLDL levels, lipid parameters, blood glucose, C-peptide, HbA1c and inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were studied.

Outcomes that were analysed included early all-cause mortality (30-day mortality), myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke and renal failure. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were reported using fixed or random effect models and publication bias was assessed. Preoperative statin therapy resulted in a 1.5% absolute risk reduction (2.2 vs. 3.7%; P < 0.0001) and 43% odds reduction for early all-cause mortality (OR 0.57; 95%CI: 0.49-0.67).

Using SNP concentrations at or below the ED50, SNP (0.01, 0.1 or 0.5 mmol/l) increased the amount of cell death when combined with lovastatin (1, 10, 50 and 100 micromol/l). At lovastatin concentrations of 50 micromol/l and less, the amount of cell death was consistently similar to the arithmetic sum of SNP and lovastatin, suggesting that there was an additive and not synergistic relationship between SNP and lovastatin. In combination with lovastatin (100 micromol/l), however, the amount of cell death was consistently lower than the calculated expected value and suggested saturation of a common mechanism. The combination of SNP and lovastatin produced the characteristic microscopic changes of apoptosis. Considering that both SNP and lovastatin can activate caspase-3, cells were treated with the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO. This inhibitor produced a significant (p < 0.05) and consistent 30% reduction in the amount of cell death induced by SNP and lovastatin.",

Substantial reductions in lipid levels were apparent after 2 months (total cholesterol, -22%; low-density lipoproteins, -28%; triglycerides, -31%) and were maintained at 6 months. Reductions were significant in both subgroups of recipients; the vast majority (12 of 14, 85%) of recipients with a history of statins intolerance were able to tolerate ezetimibe plus low-dose simvastatin. This study provides suggestive evidence that treatment with ezetimibe plus low-dose simvastatin is well tolerated by HT recipients and may be effective for treatment of dyslipidemia in HT recipients with statins intolerance or resistance.",

    "41": "Atherosclerosis results from a combination of local blood flow patterns and systemic risk factors. We investigated whether non-uniform shear stress at bifurcations induces pro-atherogenic endothelial dysfunction and monocyte recruitment. Bifurcating flow-through cell culture slides were used to expose HUVECs to laminar or non-uniform shear stress for 18 h at 10 dyne/cm(2). For the adhesion assay, HUVECs were subsequently perfused with medium containing THP-1 monocytes for 1 h. Protein expression was determined by immunofluorescence. In areas exposed to laminar shear stress, alignment of endothelial cells with the flow was observed, accompanied by upregulation of eNOS and downregulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In contrast, cells exposed to non-uniform shear stress near the outer walls of bifurcations were characterized by irregular, unaligned shape, induction of endothelin-1 and CTGF, as well as reduced eNOS expression. These atherogenic effects of non-uniform shear stress were prevented when cells were treated with statins (1 mumol/l) during flow. Under non-uniform shear stress, a slight induction of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-/P-selectin was observed. In agreement with this, monocyte recruitment, which was nearly undetectable under laminar shear stress, was moderately induced by non-uniform shear stress (P<0.02). In conclusion, inhibition of antioxidative eNOS and upregulation of atherogenic proteins is the first step in non-uniform shear stress-mediated endothelial dysfunction, which in vivo in the presence of atherogenic risk factors may further enhance monocyte recruitment into the artery wall.",

Residual platelet activity assessed by adenosine diphosphate (20 micromol/L)-induced platelet aggregation was not significantly influenced by statin treatment. Nor the significant effects of CYP3A4-metabolization pathway on post-treatment aggregation were recorded, although there was even a trend to lower RPA values in patients treated with CYP3A4-metabolized statins. Further, in an inter-individual analysis comparing patients treated with CYP3A4- and non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins, no time-dependent difference of clopidogre\u013as anti-aggregatory effects was observed. Clinical follow-up of major adverse events (myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, death) in 991 patients within 3 months revealed no significant adverse effects of statin treatment on clinical outcome.

These agents can still indirectly have an effect on disease-related immune regulatory and effector functions within the CNS by modulating the properties of systemic immune cells that migrate to this compartment. Such immune cells could interact with perivascular and innate immune cells that are involved in immune regulation and with cells that are either targets of the disease process (oligodendrocytes, neurons) and/or are involved with repair (progenitor cells). Newer agents reported to favorably impact on relapse frequency in MS include the sphingosine-1-phosphate agonist, fingolimod, and the lipophilic statin, simvastatin. Both agents access the CNS and thus represent examples of agents that could directly impact on disease-relevant injury and repair process within the CNS.",

Treatments were appropriate for the condition, gemfibrozil for HTG and a statin for HCHL. Modifications depend on the drug and lipid fraction examined. Both classes of drugs modify fatty acid composition but gemfibrozil modifications are more numerous and dramatic than are the modifications by statins. Gemfibrozil produces major modifications in fatty acid composition, which are both fatty acid and lipid class specific but generally decreases SFA and increases PUFA (mainly n6) and increases the proportion of fatty acids with chain length of 18C or more. Statins tend to increase chain length but have less effect on saturation. Notably, all three drugs increased arachidonic acid (AA) in PL and CE. Statins decreased gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) in PL and CE but gemfibrozil only increased GLA in TG.", 
    "51": "The objective of the study was to prepare amorphous atorvastatin hemi-calcium using spray-drying and supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process and evaluate its physicochemical properties and oral bioavailability. Atorvastatin hemi-calcium trihydrate was transformed to anhydrous amorphous form by spray-drying and SAS process. With the SAS process, the mean particle size and the specific surface area of amorphous atorvastatin were drastically changed to 68.7+/-15.8nm, 120.35+/-1.40m2/g and 95.7+/-12.2nm, 79.78+/-0.93m2/g from an acetone solution and a tetrahydrofuran solution, respectively and appeared to be associated with better performance in apparent solubility, dissolution and pharmacokinetic studies, compared with unprocessed crystalline atorvastatin. Oral AUC0-8h values in SD rats for crystalline and amorphous atorvastatin were as follow: 1121.4+/-212.0ngh/mL for crystalline atorvastatin, 3249.5+/-406.4ngh/mL and 3016.1+/-200.3ngh/mL for amorphous atorvastatin from an acetone solution and a tetrahydrofuran solution with SAS process, 2227.8+/-274.5 and 2099.9+/-339.2ngh/mL for amorphous atorvastatin from acetone and tetrahydrofuran with spray-drying. The AUCs of all amorphous atorvastatin significantly increased (P<0.05) compared with crystalline atorvastatin, suggesting that the enhanced bioavailability was attributed to amorphous nature and particle size reduction. In addition, the SAS process exhibits better bioavailability than spray-drying because of particle size reduction with narrow particle size distribution. It was concluded that physicochemical properties and bioavailability of crystalline atorvastatin could be improved by physical modification such as particle size reduction and generation of amorphous state using spray-drying and SAS process. Further, SAS process was a powerful methodology for improving the physicochemical properties and bioavailability of atorvastatin.",

M1/4 receptor distribution and alterations in the post-mortem rat brain were detected by [(3)H]pirenzepine binding autoradiography. Simvastatin (1 mg/kg/day) increased [(3)H]pirenzepine binding, predominantly in the prefrontal cortex (171%, P<0.001), primary motor cortex (153%, P=0.001), cingulate cortex (109%, P<0.001), hippocampus (138%, P<0.001), caudate putamen (122%, P=0.002) and nucleus accumbens (170%, P<0.001) compared with controls; while lower but still significant increases of [(3)H]pirenzepine binding were observed in the examined regions following simvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) treatment. Our results also provide strong evidence that chronic simvastatin administration, especially at a low dosage, up-regulates M1/4 receptor binding, which is likely to be independent of its muscarinic agonist-like effect. Alterations in [(3)H]pirenzepine binding in the examined brain areas may represent the specific regions that mediate the clinical effects of simvastatin treatment on cognition and memory via the muscarinic cholinergic system. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the critical roles of simvastatin in treating neurodegenerative disorders, via muscarinic receptors.",

Results were similar in participants with existing cardiovascular disease. In BRHS, 440 cases of incident cardiovascular disease and 105 of diabetes occurred over 7 years. Metabolic syndrome was modestly associated with incident cardiovascular disease (relative risk 1.27 [1.04-1.56]) despite strong association with diabetes (7.47 [4.90-11.46]). In both studies, body-mass index or waist circumference, triglyceride, and glucose cutoff points were not associated with risk of cardiovascular disease, but all five components were associated with risk of new-onset diabetes.",

A new measure, dispensation delay, was measured as the gap between the most recent physician or hospital visit and the fill date of the index prescription. Five categories of dispensation delay were created--no delay, 1 to 7 days, 8 to 30 days, 31 to 183 days, and >183 days. Nonpersistence was defined as a gap of >or=30 days in the statin prescription supply during the follow-up period.

    "72": "We previously characterized VE-statin/egfl7, a protein that is exclusively secreted by endothelial cells and modulates smooth muscle cell migration. Here, we show that VE-statin/egfl7 is the first known natural negative regulator of vascular elastogenesis. Transgenic mice, expressing VE-statin/egfl7 under the control of keratin-14 promoter, showed an accumulation of VE-statin/egfl7 in arterial walls where its presence correlated with an impaired organization of elastic fibres. In vitro, fibroblasts cultured in the presence of VE-statin/egfl7 were unable to deposit elastic fibres due to a deficient conversion of soluble tropoelastin into insoluble mature elastin. VE-statin/egfl7 interacts with the catalytic domain of lysyl oxidase (LOX) enzymes and, in endothelial cells, endogenous VE-statin/egfl7 colocalizes with LoxL2 and inhibits elastic fibre deposition. In contrast, mature elastic fibres are abundantly deposited by endothelial cells that are prevented from producing endogenous VE-statin/egfl7. We propose a model where VE-statin/egfl7 produced by endothelial cells binds to the catalytic domains of enzymes of the LOX family in the vascular wall, thereby preventing the crosslink of tropoelastin molecules into mature elastin polymers and regulating vascular elastogenesis.",

    "85": "Statins are widely used in the prevention of atheromatous disease and its complications. While their lipid lowering effects are very important, there is increasing emphasis on the other effects of statins described as pleiotropic. These include atheromatous plaque stabilisation generally ascribed to their anti-inflammatory properties. It is increasingly clear that perioperative cardiac events relate to both haemodynamic perturbations (with imbalance between oxygen demand and oxygen supply to the myocardium), and rupture/disruption of atheromatous plaques. Thus, the effects of statins on perioperative cardiac outcome have been studied, mostly in observational studies. The majority of the studies have shown benefits of statin therapy. The reason for these reported benefits is the anti-inflammatory properties of statins in the face of the known release of such mediators during major surgery, leading to plaque disruption and major adverse cardiac events. To date there are too few randomised controlled studies to recommend the prophylactic administration of statins preoperatively, yet the cohort studies are suggestive of benefits.", 
    "86": "Interventional trials with vitamin E have been planned on the assumption that it could reduce atherosclerotic progression via inhibition of oxidative stress. These trials have been conducted in patients at risk for or with cardiovascular disease, but the results have been divergent. The reason for the equivocal results is still unclear. We have recently demonstrated that in patients with hypercholesterolemia, the administration of a statin is associated with reduced urinary isoprostanes, a marker of oxidative stress, and normalization of circulating levels of vitamin E, indicating that statins enhance the antioxidant status. Based on these arguments, we reanalyzed the interventional trials with vitamin E to see if concomitant use of statins could have created a potential bias. We reviewed 9 interventional trials, each including > 1000 patients. In 5 of the 9 trials, the concomitant use of statins was reported. In the arm randomized to vitamin E, a concomitant use of statins was reported in at least one-third of the population. In some trials, the percentage of patients given statins was > 50%, suggesting that a large part of the follow-up population was likely useless treated with vitamin E in view of the concomitant antioxidant effect of statins. Also, the anti-atherosclerotic effect of statins could have reduced the possibility that a prespecified sample size had an adequate power to observe a difference between vitamin E and placebo-treated groups. We therefore suggest that a meta-analysis of trials with vitamin E should be re-done by excluding patients who concomitantly used statins.", 
    "87": "Traditional cardiac risk factors only partially explain the biological mechanisms by which persons of lower socioeconomic status (SES) have higher cardiovascular risk. Dietary factors, resulting in lower circulating levels of (n-3) fatty acids, may also contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with low SES. We tested whether low SES is associated with RBC levels of (n-3) fatty acids in patients with coronary heart disease. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 987 adults with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) recruited from San Francisco area outpatient clinics. Four SES measures (household income, education, occupation, and housing status) were assessed by self-report. RBC fatty acid levels of 2 (n-3) fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), were measured in venous blood samples from fasting subjects. Participants with lower household income, education, occupation, and housing status had lower RBC levels of (n-3) fatty acids (P < 0.001 for all 4 measures). In multivariable models, household income, education, and occupation remained strongly associated with DHA and EPA levels after adjustment for demographic factors, BMI, physical activity, statin use, and kidney function (P < 0.001 for all 3 measures). Housing status was not associated with DHA or EPA after multivariable adjustment. Among patients with CAD, 3 indicators of low SES, household income, education, and occupation, were strongly associated with lower RBC levels of (n-3) fatty acids. Our results raise the possibility that (n-3) fatty acids may be an important mediating factor in the association between low SES and CVD.",

Total cholesterol (TC), low-density cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), immunosuppressant drug levels, laboratory and clinical parameters were assessed before, four months and one yr after initiation of ezetimibe treatment. Mean equivalent statin dose was 53.5 +/- 12.3 mg of pravastatin, remaining unchanged throughout the study period. Ezetimibe was generally well tolerated, only two patients (8%) discontinued ezetimibe due to stomach pain or headache. Mean TC decreased from 231.8 +/- 6.4 mg/dL before therapy to 202.2 +/- 8.8 mg/dL after four months and 192.9 +/- 7.0 mg/dL after one yr (p < 0.001).

Initial LDL-C and cardiac diagnosis before transplantation were identified as predictors of absolute LDL-C reduction. Immunosuppressant drug doses and blood concentrations were unchanged as well as other laboratory and clinical parameters. Ezetimibe appears safe and effective for further reduction of TC and LDL-C in heart allograft recipients already on stable statin therapy. Extent of pre-treatment LDL-C and cardiac disorder prior to transplantation appear to correlate with the efficacy of ezetimibe therapy.", 
    "101": "Statins have been suggested to prevent prostate cancer. Our aim was to examine statin use in relation to both total prostate cancer and the more clinically important advanced prostate cancer, through a detailed metaanalysis of the epidemiologic studies published on the subject in peer-reviewed literature. A comprehensive search for articles published up to November 2007 was performed, reviews of each study were conducted and data were abstracted. Prior to metaanalysis, the studies were evaluated for publication bias and heterogeneity. Pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed. Nineteen studies [6 randomized clinical trials (RCTs), 6 cohort and 7 case-control studies] contributed to the analysis. There was no evidence of an association between statin use and total prostate cancer among either RCTs (RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.93-1.20) or the observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.65-1.24). However, high heterogeneity was detected among the observational studies. Moreover, long-term statin use did not significantly affect the risk of total prostate cancer (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.77-1.13). In contrast, synthesis of the available reports that had specifically examined statin use in relation to advanced prostate cancer indicated a protective association (RR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.64-0.93).

    "102": "The ebb and flow of cellular life depends largely on signaling pathways and networks, which are regulated by specific protein-protein interactions. These interactions often involve assembly of large signaling complexes containing many different protein kinases, protein phosphatases, their substrates, and scaffold proteins. Identification of protein complexes is the key to understanding cellular functions. One of the techniques used for the isolation of protein complexes is the affinity purification system. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxyl-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (i.e., statins) exert cholesterol-independent vasoprotective effects that are mediated, in part, through the activation of Akt. However, the molecular mechanism remains unknown. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the pleioptropic effects of statins, we searched for the binding molecule of Akt1 by using a combined mass spectrometry and affinity purification strategy. By this technique, we identified the protein-protein interactions of 23 proteins from statin-treated rat aortic endothelial cells (rAECs). Our results suggest that this approach is very effective and statin activates many Akt down-stream targets, not only endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).

Fusion enthalpy DeltaH(fus), melting point temperature, Tm, and the differential molar heat capacity, DeltaC(P), were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to be 43,136J/mol, 445.5K, and 255J/(molK), respectively. In order to use the regular solution equation, simplified assumptions have been made concerning DeltaC(P), specifically, DeltaC(P)=0, or DeltaC(P)=DeltaS. In this study, we examined the extent to which these assumptions influence the magnitude of the ideal solubility of lovastatin, and determined that both assumptions underestimate the ideal solubility of lovastatin. The solubility data was used with the calculated ideal solubility to obtain activity coefficients, which were then fitted to the van't Hoff-like regular solution equation. Examination of the plots indicated that both assumptions give erroneous excess enthalpy of solution, H(infinity), and hence thermodynamically inconsistent activity coefficients. The order of increasing ideality, or solubility of lovastatin was butanol>1-propanol>1-pentanol>1-hexanol>1-octanol.",

Concerns regarding risks associated with such combination therapies may limit their use. A systematic overview of randomized controlled trials to assess risks associated with combination statin and ezetimibe therapy was performed. Eighteen trials were identified, including 14,471 patients. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 48 weeks. Compared with statin monotherapy, combination therapy did not result in significant absolute increases in risks of myalgias (risk difference -0.033, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.06 to -0.01), creatine kinase increases (risk difference 0.011, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.04), rhabdomyolysis (risk difference -0.003, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.004), transaminase increases (risk difference -0.003, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.005), gastrointestinal adverse events (risk difference 0.005, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.04), or discontinuations because of an adverse event (risk difference -0.005, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02). In conclusion, based on available randomized trials, the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy did not increase the risk of myalgias, creatine kinase increases, rhabdomyolysis, transaminase increases, gastrointestinal adverse events, or discontinuations because of an adverse event. Additional trials are necessary to ensure that results of clinical trials are consistent with routine clinical practice, particularly in older patients with more co-morbid conditions and patients on higher statin doses.", 
    "106": "Recently, statins have been being studied for their proapoptic and antimetastatic effects. However, the exact mechanisms of their anticancer action are still unclear. Dolichyl phosphate is a nonsterol isoprenoid derivative in the mevalonate pathway that affects the expression of the Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). IGF-1R activation is required for prostate cell proliferation; therefore, IGF-1R inhibitory agents may be of preventive and/or therapeutic value. In this study, the effects of simvastatin on IGF-1R signaling in prostate cancer PC-3 cells were examined. Simvastatin suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of PC-3, and the expression of IGF-1R was suppressed by simvastatin. Knockdown of IGF-1R by siRNA led to inhibition of proliferation of PC-3. Simvastatin also inhibited IGF-1-induced activation of both ERK and Akt signaling and IGF-1-induced PC-3 cell proliferation. Our results suggest statins are potent inhibitors of the IGF-1/IGF-1R system in prostate cancer cells and may be beneficial in prostate cancer treatment.",

    "123": "The biological functions of liver X receptors (LXRs) alpha and beta have primarily been linked to pathways involved in fatty acid and cholesterol homeostasis. Here we report a novel role of LXR activation in protecting cells from statin-induced death. When 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate by standard isobutylmethylxanthine/dexamethasone/insulin treatment in the presence of statins, they failed to differentiate and underwent massive apoptosis. The simultaneous addition of selective LXR agonists prevented the statin-induced apoptosis. By using mouse embryo fibroblasts from wild-type (LXRalpha+/+/LXRbeta+/+), LXRalpha knock-out mice (LXRalpha(-/-)/LXRbeta+/+), LXRbeta knock-out mice (LXRalpha+/-/LXRbeta(-/-)), and LXR double knock-out mice (LXRalpha(-/-)/LXRbeta(-/-)) as well as 3T3-L1 cells transduced with retroviruses expressing either wild-type LXRalpha or a dominant negative version of LXRalpha, we demonstrate that the response to LXR agonists is LXR-dependent. Interestingly, LXR-mediated rescue of statin-induced apoptosis was not related to up-regulation of genes previously shown to be involved in the antiapoptotic action of LXR. Furthermore, forced expression of Bcl-2 did not prevent statin-induced apoptosis; nor did LXR action depend on protein kinase B, whose activation by insulin was impaired in statin-treated cells. Rather, LXR-dependent rescue of statin-induced apoptosis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes required NF-kappaB activity, since expression of a dominant negative version of IkappaBalpha prevented LXR agonist-dependent rescue of statin-induced apoptosis. Thus, the results presented in this paper provide novel insight into the action of statins on and LXR-dependent inhibition of apoptosis.", 
    "124": "The interlead variability of QT interval in the 12-lead electrocardiogram, QT dispersion (QTd), has been shown to reflect dispersion of ventricular refractoriness and may provide a measure of arrhythmogenic potential in diabetic patients. QTd and heart rate corrected QTd (QTcd) were also proposed to be accurate predictors of cardiac death in patients with diabetes. In recent years, experimental and clinical evidence demonstrates that statins exert antiarrhythmic properties. Therefore, in the present study, we have examined whether simvastatin treatment has any effect on the QTd and QTcd in patients with diabetes mellitus. Sixty type 2 diabetic patients without known coronary artery disease and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >100mg/dl and 30 age and sex-matched non-diabetic controls were included in a prospective study. Out of 60 diabetic patients, 30 were treated with simvastatin 40 mg/day for 1 year and the remaining 30 subjects were served as diabetic controls. No lipid lowering therapy was administered to the diabetic and the non-diabetic controls. QTd and QTcd of treated diabetics and the non-diabetic controls were measured at baseline, 6, 12 weeks and at 1 year. QTd and QTcd of the diabetic controls were obtained at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Both QTd and QTcd were significantly greater in patients with the diabetes than in the non-diabetic controls at baseline (52+/-13 ms vs. 41+/-12 ms, p<0.001 and 62+/-17 ms vs. 42+/-11 ms, p<0.001, respectively). Simvastatin therapy significantly decreased both QTd and QTcd at the end of first year compared to baseline (51+/-15 ms vs. 33+/-11 ms, p<0.001 and 60+/-18 ms vs. 38+/-12 ms, p<0.001, respectively). No significant change were found in QTd and QTcd in the non-diabetic (p=0.29 and p=0.87 by ANOVA, respectively) and in the diabetic controls (p=0.72 and p=0.57, by ANOVA, respectively). This study suggests for the first time that simvastatin treatment in diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia is associated with an improvement in the heterogeneity of cardiac repolarization.

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are prescribed for their lipid-lowering effects but recent evidence suggests they have pleiotropic effects independent of lipid balance regulation that may explain their role in dramatically decreasing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. The mechanisms responsible are unclear but endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction is critical. To investigate potential anti-inflammatory properties of statins on EC, functional responses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human neutrophils under physiological flow conditions were studied. These interactions were quantified in response to inflammatory mediators following pre-treatment with statin. Histamine stimulation resulted in significant (p<0.001) increases in transient interactions between neutrophils and EC (tethering). These effects were significantly reduced (p<0.001) on pre-treatment with statin. TNF-alpha stimulation resulted in significant (p<0.001) increases in rolling interactions. These effects were significantly (p<0.001) reduced following pre-treatment of EC with statin. Mevalonate pre-treatment of EC significantly reversed the effects of statin pre-treatment on both tethering and rolling (p<0.001). Reductions in surface expression of P- and E-selectin were confirmed by ELISA. EC exposed to histamine demonstrated significantly increased (p<0.01) levels of P-selectin, abrogated (p<0.001) by pre-treatment with statin.

In addition to these techniques the new criteria for scoring micronucleus test were applied for more complete detection of baseline damage in binuclear lymphocytes exposed to atorvastatin 80 mg/day in different time periods by virtue of measuring the frequency of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds. All parameters obtained with the standard comet assay and Fpg-modified comet assay were significantly higher in the treated than in control lymphocytes. The Fpg-modified comet assay showed a significantly greater tail length, tail intensity, and tail moment in all treated lymphocytes than did the standard comet assay, which suggests that oxidative stress is likely to be responsible for DNA damage. DNA damage detected by the standard comet assay indicates that some other mechanism is also involved. In addition to the comet assay, a total number of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds were significantly higher in the exposed than in controlled lymphocytes. Regression analyses showed a positive correlation between the results obtained by the comet (Fpg-modified and standard) and micronucleus assay. Overall, the study demonstrated that atorvastatin in its highest dose is capable of producing damage on the level of DNA molecule and cell.",

In the absence of clinical end-point data from trials, 13 (of which five were multi-arm) phase III multi-centre randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (of varying methodological quality) of short-term duration (12-48 weeks) with surrogate end-point data were included. For patients not adequately controlled with a statin alone, a meta-analysis of six studies showed that a fixed-dose combination of ezetimibe and statin treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and total cholesterol (Total-c) compared with statin alone (p < 0.00001). Four studies (not eligible for meta-analysis) that titrated (either forced or stepwise) the statin doses to LDL-c targets generally showed that the co-administration of ezetimibe and statin was significantly more effective in reducing plasma LDL-c concentrations than statin monotherapy (p < 0.05 for all studies). For patients where a statin is not considered appropriate, a meta-analysis of seven studies demonstrated that ezetimibe monotherapy significantly reduced LDL-c levels compared with placebo (p < 0.00001). There were no statistically significant differences in LDL-c-lowering effects across different subgroups. Ezetimibe therapy (either in combination with a statin or monotherapy) appeared to be well tolerated compared to statin monotherapy or placebo, respectively. No ezetimibe studies reported data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). There was a wide range in the economic results depending on the treatment strategies evaluated. When comparing ezetimibe monotherapy with no treatment in individuals with baseline LDL-c values of 3.0-4.0 mmol/l, the results range from 21,000 pounds to 50,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results for individuals with baseline LDL-c values over 5.0 mmol/l are below 30,000 pounds per QALY. When comparing the costs and benefits of adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin treatment compared with maintaining statin treatment at the current dose, the majority of results are above values generally considered to be cost-effective (range 19,000 pounds to 48,000 pounds per QALY). Based on the evidence available, when comparing the costs and benefits associated with adding ezetimibe to ongoing statin treatment compared with a switch to a more potent statin, the results are governed by the difference in the cost of the treatment regimens compared and results range from 1500 pounds to 116,000 pounds per QALY.",

However, when used as a monotherapy, ezetimibe is less effective than statins in lowering LDL-c. Given the limitations in the effectiveness data, there is great uncertainty in the economic results. These suggest that ezetimibe could be a cost-effective treatment for individuals with high baseline LDL-c values, for patients with diabetes and for individuals with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.

In addition to the statin-mediated effect on the monocyte cytokine production, which regulates Th17 cell differentiation, simvastatin directly inhibits IL-17 production in CD4+ cells, which may collectively inhibit the autoimmune response in multiple sclerosis (MS), a central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory demyelinating disease.", 
    "153": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the cardiac toxicity induced by carboplatin, a second generation platinum-containing anti-cancer drug, and to test whether pravastatin can reduce this cardio-toxicity. In the present study, infusion of carboplatin (100 mg/kg) to mice resulted in decreased survival rates and abnormal cardiac histology, concomitant with increased cardiac apoptosis. In addition, treatment of cultured rat cardiomyocytes with carboplatin (100 muM for 48 h) caused marked apoptosis and increased caspase-3, -9, and cytochrome C, but decreased BCL-XL protein expression, and this was inhibited by reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger n-acetylcysteine. Furthermore, pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with pravastatin (20 microM) before carboplatin exposure significantly attenuated apoptosis and decreased caspase-3, -9, cytochrome C activity. Lastly, mice pre-treated with pravastatin before carboplatin treatment showed improved survival rate and cardiac function, with reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis via activating Akt and restoring normal mitochondrial HAX-1 in heart tissue. In summary, our results show that carboplatin can induce cardiotoxicity in vivo and in cultured cells via a mitochondrial pathway related to ROS production, whereas pravastatin administration can reduce such oxidative stress thus prevented cardiac apoptosis. Therefore, pravastatin can be used as a cytoprotective agent prior to carboplatin chemotherapy.", 
    "154": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a rare hereditary lipid storage disease characterised by deposits of cholestanol. In a female patient with bilateral swelling of the Achilles tendon who underwent biopsy, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis was confirmed by combining disease patterns. She suffered from ataxia, depression, epilepsy, reduced intelligence, bilateral cataracts, gallstones, and atherosclerosis. Concentration of serum cholestanol was 10 times higher than normal. As causal therapy, ursodeoxycholic acid and statin drugs were prescribed to halt progression.", 
    "155": "Recently, atherosclerosis has been considered to be the result of inflammation. Interestingly, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-Co) A inhibitors (statins), which are clinically used as lipid-lowering agents, have been reported to have various anti-inflammatory effects. As abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common degenerative condition associated with atherosclerosis, this study was designed to investigate the inhibitory effect of a statin, atorvastatin, on aneurysm formation apart from its lipid-lowering effect. We employed an elastase-induced rat AAA model, as statins do not lower cholesterol in rats. Mean aneurysm diameter was significantly smaller in the atorvastatin treatment group as compared to control at 4 weeks after surgery (P<0.05). Interestingly, atorvastatin inhibited the expression of ICAM and MCP-1, followed by the suppression of macrophage recruitment into the aortic wall at 1 week after operation. A significant reduction in MMP-12, but not MMP-2, -3 and -9, expression was also observed by treatment with atorvastatin at 1 week after surgery. In addition, synthesis of collagen and elastin in the vascular wall were significantly increased by atorvastatin. Here, the present study demonstrated a direct effect of atorvastatin to inhibit the progression of aortic aneurysm, independent of its lipid-lowering effect. This study suggests new therapeutic aspects of statins to inhibit the progression of aneurysms.",

    "158": "A total of 10,001 patients with documented coronary disease, including 4,654 with previous CABG, were randomized to atorvastatin 80 or 10 mg/day and were followed for a median of 4.9 years. The primary end point was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or stroke).", 
    "159": "A first major cardiovascular event occurred in 11.4% of the patients with prior CABG and 8.5% of those without prior CABG (p < 0.001). In CABG patients, mean LDL-cholesterol levels at study end were 79 mg/dl in the 80-mg arm and 101 mg/dl in the 10-mg arm, and the primary event rate was 9.7% in the 80-mg arm and 13.0% in the 10-mg arm (hazard ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.87, p = 0.0004). Repeat revascularization during follow-up, either CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention, was performed in 11.3% of the CABG patients in the 80-mg arm and 15.9% in the 10-mg arm (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 0.82, p < 0.0001).",

    "161": "Inflammatory processes are considered to participate in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins have been used successfully in the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease. Chronic periodontitis has been suggested to contribute to CVD. The aim of this study was to examine the association of statin use and clinical markers of chronic periodontitis.", 
    "162": "Periodontal probing pocket depth (PPD) values were collected from dental records of 100 consecutive adult patients referred to a university dental clinic for treatment of advanced chronic periodontitis. A novel index, Periodontal Inflammatory Burden Index (PIBI), was derived from the PPD values to estimate systemic effects of periodontitis.", 
    "163": "Periodontitis patients taking statins had a 37% lower number of pathological periodontal pockets than those without statin medication (P = 0.00043). PIBI, which combines and unifies the data on PPD, was 40% smaller in statin using patients than in patients without statin (P = 0.00069). PIBI of subjects on simvastatin and atorvastatin both differed significantly from patients without statin and were on the same level. The subjects' number of teeth had no effect on the results", 
    "164": "Patients on statin medication exhibit fewer signs of periodontal inflammatory injury than subjects without the statin regimen. PIBI provides a tool for monitoring inflammatory load of chronic periodontitis. The apparent beneficial effects of statins may in part be mediated by their pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effect on periodontal tissue.", 
    "165": "Rhabdomyolysis is a potential adverse consequence of statin therapy. Here, we report a patient with prostate cancer being treated with simvastatin who developed rhabdomyolysis after coadministration with fluconazole. The rhabdomyolysis promptly resolved after discontinuation of fluconazole, suggesting the possible role of drug interaction in the development of rhabdomyolysis with coadministration of the two medications. Both simvastatin and fluconazole were promptly discontinued, and the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, where vigorous hydration along with urine alkalinization led to resolution of rhabdomyolysis. Since statins are commonly prescribed treatments for individuals with hyperlipidemia, caution is advised in coadministration with azoles such as fluconazole. Although supportive treatment remains the mainstay of therapy for patients with rhabdomyolysis, fatal consequences can arise from hyperkalemia, cardiac arrhythmia, renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation.", 
    "166": "Elevation in C-reactive protein (CRP) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease progression and levels are reduced by treatment with statins. However, on-treatment CRP, given baseline CRP and treatment, is not normally distributed and outliers exist even when transformations are applied. Although classical non-parametric tests address some of these issues, they do not enable straightforward inclusion of covariate information. The aims of this study were to produce a model that improved efficiency and accuracy of analysis of CRP data. Estimation of treatment effects and identification of outliers were addressed using controlled trials of rosuvastatin. The robust statistical technique of MM-estimation was used to fit models to data in the presence of outliers and was compared with least-squares estimation. To develop the model, appropriate transformations of the response and baseline variables were selected. The model was used to investigate how on-treatment CRP related to baseline CRP and estimated treatment effects with rosuvastatin. On comparing least-squares and MM-estimation, MM-estimation was superior to least-squares estimation in that parameter estimates were more efficient and outliers were clearly identified. Relative reductions in CRP were higher at higher baseline CRP levels. There was also evidence of a dose-response relationship between CRP reductions from baseline and rosuvastatin. Several large outliers were identified, although there did not appear to be any relationships between the incidence of outliers and treatments. In conclusion, using robust estimation to model CRP data is superior to least-squares estimation and non-parametric tests in terms of efficiency, outlier identification and the ability to include covariate information.", 
    "167": "Statin therapy induces plaque regression and may stabilize atheromatous plaques. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a high-resolution in-vivo imaging modality that allows characterization of atherosclerotic plaques. We aimed to demonstrate the potential utility of OCT in evaluating coronary plaques in patients with or without statin therapy.", 
    "168": "Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization were enrolled. We identified culprit lesions and performed intracoronary OCT imaging. Plaque lipid pool, fibrous cap thickness, and frequency of thin-cap fibroatheroma were evaluated using previously validated criteria. Macrophage density was determined from optical signals within fibrous caps. Presence of calcification, thrombosis, and rupture was assessed.", 
    "169": "Forty-eight patients were included (26 on statins, 22 without statins). Baseline characteristics were similar apart from lipid profile. Patients on statin therapy had lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (4.45+/-1.35 vs. 5.26+/-0.83 mmol/l, P=0.02; 2.23+/-0.78 vs. 3.26+/-0.62 mmol/l, P<0.001, respectively). Frequencies of lipid-rich plaque (69 vs. 82%), thin-cap fibroatheroma (31 vs. 50%), plaque calcification (15 vs. 5%) and thrombosis (15 vs. 32%), and fibrous cap macrophage density were comparable between statin and nonstatin groups (5.9 vs. 6.3%; all P=NS). Ruptured plaques were, however, significantly less frequent in patients on established statin therapy (8 vs. 36%; P=0.03) with a trend toward increased minimum fibrous cap thickness (78 vs. 49 microm; P=0.07).", 
    "170": "We demonstrated the use of OCT in plaque characterization and found that patients on prior statin therapy have reduced incidence of ruptured plaques and a trend toward thicker fibrous caps. This suggests that statins may stabilize coronary plaques.", 
    "171": "The last 20 years have witnessed dramatic reductions in cardiovascular risk using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Using this approach one can achieve a reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events of 21% for every 1 mmol/l (39 mg/dl) decrease in LDL-C. However, despite intensive therapy with high dose \"statins\" to lower LDL-C levels below 2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl), the risk of a major cardiovascular event in patients with established coronary artery disease remains significant at a level approaching an annual risk of 9%, paving the way for new strategies for reducing the residual cardiovascular risk in this patient group. Early epidemiological studies have identified low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (<1.0 mmol/l or 40 mg/dl), a common feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome, to be an independent determinant of increased cardiovascular risk. The beneficial effects of HDL-C on the cardiovascular system have been attributed to its ability to remove cellular cholesterol, as well as its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antithrombotic properties, which act in concert to improve endothelial function and inhibit atherosclerosis, thereby reducing cardiovascular risk. As such, raising HDL-C in patients with aggressively lowered LDL-C provides an additional strategy for addressing the residual cardiovascular risk present in these patients groups. Studies suggest that for every 0.03 mmol/l (1.0 mg/dl) increase in HDL-C, cardiovascular risk is reduced by 2-3%. Raising HDL-C can be achieved by both lifestyle changes and pharmacological means, the former of which include smoking cessation, aerobic exercise, weight loss and dietary manipulation. Therapeutic strategies have included niacin, fibrates, thiazolidinediones and bile acid sequestrants. Newly developed pharmacological agents include apolipoprotein A-I mimetics and the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, JTT-705 and torcetrapib, the latter of which has been recently withdrawn from clinical testing because of serious adverse effects. Emerging experimental studies investigating the complex pathways of HDL metabolism have identified several new targets for raising HDL-C with new pharmaceutical agents currently in development. For the time being, the long-acting formulations of nicotinic acid remain the most effective and best tolerated pharmacological strategy for raising HDL-C in patients already on statin therapy to control LDL-C. Therefore, raising HDL-C represents an important strategy for reducing residual cardiovascular risk in patients already optimally treated with statins, and should lead to further improvements in clinical outcomes in these patient groups."
