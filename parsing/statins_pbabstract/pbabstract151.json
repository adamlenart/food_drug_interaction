    "0": "A recent explosion in the amount of cardiovascular risk and incipient, undetected subclinical cardiovascular pathology has swept across the globe. Nearly 70% of adult Americans are overweight or obese; the prevalence of visceral obesity stands at 53% and continues to rise. At any one time, 55% of the population is on a weight-loss diet, and almost all fail. Fewer than 15% of adults or children exercise sufficiently, and over 60% engage in no vigorous activity. Among adults, 11%-13% have diabetes, 34% have hypertension, 36% have prehypertension, 36% have prediabetes, 12% have both prediabetes and prehypertension, and 15% of the population with either diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia are undiagnosed. About one-third of the adult population, and 80% of the obese, have fatty livers. With 34% of children overweight or obese, prevalence having doubled in just a few years, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and fatty livers in children are at their highest levels ever. Half of adults have at least one cardiovascular risk factor. Not even 1% of the population attains ideal cardiovascular health. Despite falling coronary death rates for decades, coronary heart disease (CHD) death rates in US women 35 to 54 years of age may now be increasing because of the obesity epidemic. Up to 65% of patients do not have their conventional risk biomarkers under control. Only 30% of high risk patients with CHD achieve aggressive low density lipoprotein (LDL) targets. Of those patients with multiple risk factors, fewer than 10% have all of them adequately controlled. Even when patients are titrated to evidence-based targets, about 70% of cardiac events remain unaddressed. Undertreatment is also common. About two-thirds of high risk primary care patients are not taking needed medications for dyslipidemia. Poor patient adherence, typically below 50%, adds further difficulty. Hence, after all such fractional reductions are multiplied, only a modest portion of total cardiovascular risk burden is actually being eliminated, and the full potential of risk reduction remains unrealized. Worldwide the situation is similar, with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome approaching 50%. Primordial prevention, resulting from healthful lifestyle habits that do not permit the appearance of risk factors, is the preferred method to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering the prevalence of obesity is the most urgent matter, and is pleiotropic since it affects blood pressure, lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, inflammation, and atherothrombotic disease progression. Physical activity also improves several risk factors, with the additional potential to lower heart rate. Given the current obstacles, success of primordial prevention remains uncertain. At the same time, the consequences of delay and inaction will inevitably be disastrous, and the sense of urgency mounts. Since most CHD events arise in a large subpopulation of low- to moderate-risk individuals, identifying a high proportion of those who will go on to develop events with accuracy remains unlikely. Without a refinement in risk prediction, the current model of targeting high-risk individuals for aggressive therapy may not succeed alone, especially given the rising burden of risk. Estimating cardiovascular risk over a period of 10 years, using scoring systems such as Framingham or SCORE, continues to enjoy widespread use and is recommended for all adults. Limitations in the former have been of concern, including the under- or over-estimation of risk in specific populations, a relatively short 10-year risk horizon, focus on myocardial infarction and CHD death, and exclusion of family history. Classification errors may occur in up to 37% of individuals, particularly women and the young. Several different scoring systems are discussed in this review. The use of lifetime risk is an important conceptual advance, since \u226590% of young adults with a low 10-year risk have a lifetime risk of \u226539%; over half of all American adults have a low 10-year risk but a high lifetime risk. At age 50 the absence of traditional risk factors is associated with extremely low lifetime risk and significantly greater longevity. Pathological and epidemiological data confirm that atherosclerosis begins in early childhood, and advances seamlessly and inexorably throughout life. Risk factors in childhood are similar to those in adults, and track between stages of life. When indicated, aggressive treatment should begin at the earliest indication, and be continued for years. For those patients at intermediate risk according to global risk scores, C-reactive protein (CRP), coronary artery calcium (CAC), and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) are available for further stratification. Using statins for primary prevention is recommended by guidelines, is prevalent, but remains underprescribed. Statin drugs are unrivaled, evidence-based, major weapons to lower cardiovascular risk. Even when low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets are attained, over half of patients continue to have disease progression and clinical events. This residual risk is of great concern, and multiple sources of remaining risk exist. Though clinical evidence is incomplete, altering or raising the blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level continues to be pursued. Of all agents available, rosuvastatin produces the greatest reduction in LDL-C, LDL-P, and improvement in apoA-I/apoB, together with a favorable safety profile. Several recent proposals and methods to lower cardiovascular risk are reviewed. A combination of approaches, such as the addition of lifetime risk, refinement of risk prediction, guideline compliance, novel treatments, improvement in adherence, and primordial prevention, including environmental and social intervention, will be necessary to lower the present high risk burden.", 
    "1": "Coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) is defined as dilatation of the coronary artery that is more than 1.5 times the diameter of normal adjacent segments. A coronary artery with a diameter more than 2 cm is termed as 'giant aneurysm' and only a few cases have been described in the literature. In adults, CAA is predominantly atherosclerotic in origin; however, other causes include Kawasaki disease, autoimmune disease, trauma, infection, dissection, congenital malformation and angioplasty. Clinical presentation, prognosis and management of a giant CAA are not well defined due to limited experience. We present the case of a patient with giant aneurysm of the proximal segment of the right coronary artery.", 
    "2": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality not only amongst the general population, but also in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Persons with CKD are much more likely to die of CVD than to experience kidney failure. Clinical trials have demonstrated that statins are gaining widespread acceptance as a principal therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis and CVD. In CKD patients the role of statins in primary prevention of CVD remains to be clarified. The absolute benefit of treatment with a statin seems to be greater among nondialysis-dependent-CKD patients. Studies in end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis did not confirm these results. Recently, however, the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) has suggested that statins with ezetimibe may be beneficial even in dialysis patients. Clinical studies with statins on proteinuria reduction and renal disease progression have yielded conflicting results. Some studies have shown a prominent reduction in proteinuria, while other studies have shown that statins had no effect or may cause proteinuria at high doses. This review examines the clinical evidence of the observed benefits of kidney function with the use of this drug category in CKD patients.", 
    "3": "Cardiovascular risk management is clearly indicated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) today because this risk is comparable to patients with diabetes. Although formal evidence of cardiovascular endpoint trials with statins and/or antihypertensives is lacking in patients with RA, there are no indications that these drugs will have limited effect. In contrast, there is accumulating evidence as to the efficacy of the use of these drugs in RA that is at least comparable to their effects in the general population. All patients with RA should therefore receive cardiovascular risk-management therapy aimed at powerful suppression of the chronic inflammatory process as well as treatment with statins and/or antihypertensives, if indicated. Obviously, monitoring in the clinical setting is necessary to document if such therapy does indeed reduce cardiovascular disease in patients with RA.",

Newly treated patients with statins between September 1 and December 31, 2004 were included. Patients were followed up 15 months. The cohort was split into three groups according to their number of additional cardiovascular risk factors that included age and gender, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (using co-medications as a proxy). Adherence was assessed for each group by using four parameters: (i) proportion of days covered by statins, (ii) regularity of the treatment over time, (iii) persistence, and (iv) the refill delay.", 
    "7": "16,397 newly treated patients were identified. Of these statin users, 21.7% did not have additional cardiovascular risk factors. Thirty-one percent had two cardiovascular risk factors and 47% had at least three risk factors. All the parameters showed a sub-optimal adherence whatever the group: days covered ranged from 56% to 72%, regularity ranged from 23% to 33% and persistence ranged from 44% to 59%, but adherence was better for those with a higher number of cardiovascular risk factors.",

We tested whether adjunctive simvastatin to conventional insulin treatment would restore PDE5I-induced as well as basal erectile response in diabetic rat model of erectile dysfunction. Forty 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into four groups, (n=10) i.e. the diabetic group (D), age-matched control (C), conventional insulin treatment (I) and adjunctive simvastatin to conventional insulin treatment (S). Following 10weeks of intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 35mg/kg), the group I and S received insulin (10U NPH/day) for 4weeks. Concurrently, group S received simvastatin (20mg/kg/day). Following 14weeks of diabetes induction, basal and PDE5I (intravenous mirodenafil 1mg/kg)-elicited erectile response were assessed during cavernous nerve electrostimulation. Then, penile tissues were processed for molecular assessment. Although group I failed to restore basal and PDE5I-induced erectile response, group S showed normalized erectile responses. Furthermore, group I showed improvement of only eNOS-related pathway, whereas group S effectively controlled both eNOS-related and RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway. Conclusively, adjunctive use of simvastatin to conventional insulin treatment showed more effectiveness in restoring erectile responses of diabetic rats by controlling the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway than conventional insulin treatment alone.", 
    "10": "Statins are best-selling medications in the management of high cholesterol and associated cardiovascular complications. They inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase in order to prevent disproportionate cholesterol synthesis. Statins slow the progression of atherosclerosis, prevent the secondary cardiovascular events and improve the cardiovascular outcomes in patients with elevated cholesterol levels. The underlying mechanisms pertaining to the cardioprotective role of statins are linked with numerous pleiotropic actions including inhibition of inflammatory events and improvement of endothelial function, besides an effective cholesterol-lowering ability. Intriguingly, recent studies suggest possible interplay between statins and nuclear transcription factors like PPARs, which should also be taken into consideration while analysing the potential of statins in the management of cardiovascular complications. It could be suggested that statins have two major roles: (i) a well-established cholesterol-lowering effect through inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase; (ii) a newly explored PPAR-activating property, which could mediate most of cardiovascular protective pleiotropic effects of statins including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic properties. The present review addressed the underlying principles pertaining to the modulatory role of statins on PPARs.", 
    "11": "Elevated Triglyceride levels are associated with increased risk for atherosclerotic disease and additional vascular risk factors such as obesity, hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance. To estimate the individual cardiovascular risk of a patient with elevated triglycerides LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels, concomitant diseases, composition of triglyceride rich lipoproteins and a family history for premature coronary heart disease are important. Primary goals for the management of hypertriglyceridemia are a reduction of cardiovascular risk and prevention of triglyceride associated complications such as the chylomicronemia syndrome. The basis of treatment are lifestyle changes: dietary intervention, alcohol avoidance, regular physical activity, weight loss and smoking cessation to modify risk factors. If triglyceride levels can not be sufficiently reduced by lifestyle intervention pharmacotherapy (nicotinic acid, fibrates and omega-3-acid ethyl esters) is indicated. Beyond reduction of triglyceride levels optimization of non-HDL-cholesterol by statin treatment is warranted to reduce vascular risk.", 
    "12": "The JUPITER trial is widely hailed as a landmark trial that has the potential to dramatically change the landscape of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Like most trials, however, it is not without its limitations. We address some of the common myths and misunderstandings that are underscored by the JUPITER trial. First, by its intentional and ill-advised exclusion of patients with low levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), it is not possible to assess whether baseline hsCRP modifies treatment response to statins or whether it identifies patients most likely to benefit from statin therapy. Second, by stopping the trial early, one cannot rule out the possibility that the treatment benefit was overestimated and risk was underestimated, thereby precluding a reliable estimate of benefit/risk. Finally, as a consequence of early stopping, it is not possible to reliably assess the cost-effectiveness of primary prevention with rosuvastatin. Given these limitations, the attendant societal health policy implications remain largely unknown.", 
    "13": "A limited number of studies have used Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) to evaluate the effect of statin therapy on left ventricular dysfunction in patients with chronic heart failure.

Based on recent data showing the role of statins not only in lowering the level of cholesterol but also in preventing cardiac and cerebrovascular damage in risk population, and in decreasing vasospasm and delayed ischemia after aneurysmal SAH, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of intraperitoneal administration of simvastatin (40\u2009mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days) in Sprague-Dawley rats 30\u2009min after SAH, as compared to vehicle-treated SAH animals. We employed a battery of well-characterized tests to assess memory, learning, motivational, balance, and behavioral performances. On days 1-4 post-SAH, simvastatin-treated rats have significantly improved beam balance scores (days 1-2, p<0.001; days 3-4, p<0.01), beam balance times (days 1-4, p<0.01), and latency to traverse the beam (days 1-3, p<0.01; day 2, p<0.005; day 4, p<0.0001) in comparison with control groups that, conversely, were not protected against SAH-related body weight changes. These results demonstrate that the administration of simvastatin may represent a beneficial therapeutic approach able to reduce post-SAH cognitive dysfunction.", 
    "18": "The main goal of meta-analysis is to combine data across studies or data sets to obtain summary estimates. In this paper, the novelty is to propose a statistical tool to assess a possible covariate imbalance in baseline variables to investigate similarity of trials. We conducted the detection of the covariate imbalance, first, through some graphical comparison of the empirical cumulative distribution functions or ECDFs, which are built by putting together arms or trials according to some risk factor, and second, through some non-parametric tests such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and the Anderson-Darling tests. To overcome the huge presence of ties, we conducted the statistical tests on perturbed versions of the original data sets. The applications concern two real meta-analyses of RCTs: the first one, on interferon-alpha treatment of chronic hepatitis C, with 107 studies involved, and the second one, on cholesterol-lowering treatment with statins, with 14 studies involved. The applications allow for analysis of both when risk factors reflecting demographic or clinical differences in experimental and control arms are balanced or not and when there are structural differences between the levels of some study variables, in order to proceed eventually with the pooling of the studies. We developed our suggestion, which is a quantitative way to assess combinability in meta-analysis, only with respect to RCTs, but it could be applied to a minor extent to non-RCTs.",

Overall, ApoB appeared to have a slightly greater correlation with nonHDL-C than with LDL-C across all treatment groups, for baseline and posttreatment values. The analysis of quintile frequencies showed a similar pattern; the proportion of patients who had values that fell in the same quintile post treatment for ApoB and LDL-C levels were 52.2% (E/S40), 44.5% (A), and 49.4% (R). Concordance between ApoB and nonHDL-C was 60.6% (E/S40), 62.4% (A), and 61.8% (R). Kappa analysis confirmed fair agreement between LDL-C and ApoB levels for all treatment groups; 0.59 (E/S40), 0.54 (A), and 0.56(R).",

When determining CVD risk at an individual patient level, limitation exists when using LDL-C or nonHDL-C per se as risk markers. In the absence of ApoB measurement, we believe that information from both LDL-C and nonHDL-C should be used together to improve the estimation of residual CVD risk among patients who are already receiving lipid lowering therapy.",

Normal cholesterolemia was documented equally in users and non-users of antimalarials (P > 0.20). After adjustment for statin and corticosteroid intake by multivariate analysis, cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels did not significantly differ in users or non-users of chloroquine (P > 0.05).

Our present work used docking studies to select potential inhibitors of pLDH, which were then tested for antimalarial activity against P. falciparum in vitro and P. berghei malaria in mice. A virtual screening in DrugBank for analogs of NADH (an essential cofactor to pLDH) and computational studies were undertaken, and the potential binding of the selected compounds to the PfLDH active site was analyzed using Molegro Virtual Docker software. Fifty compounds were selected based on their similarity to NADH. The compounds with the best binding energies (itraconazole, atorvastatin and posaconazole) were tested against P. falciparum chloroquine-resistant blood parasites. All three compounds proved to be active in two immunoenzymatic assays performed in parallel using monoclonals specific to PfLDH or a histidine rich protein (HRP2). The IC(50) values for each drug in both tests were similar, were lowest for posaconazole (<5 \u00b5M) and were 40- and 100-fold less active than chloroquine. The compounds reduced P. berghei parasitemia in treated mice, in comparison to untreated controls; itraconazole was the least active compound. The results of these activity trials confirmed that molecular docking studies are an important strategy for discovering new antimalarial drugs. This approach is more practical and less expensive than discovering novel compounds that require studies on human toxicology, since these compounds are already commercially available and thus approved for human use.", 
    "73": "Statins are effective in reducing cardiovascular events and are safe for almost all patients. Nevertheless, intolerance to statins is frequently faced in clinical practice. This is mostly due to muscular symptoms (myalgia with or without increase of plasma creatinine kinase) and/or elevation of hepatic aminotransferases, which overall constitutes approximately two-thirds of reported adverse events during statin therapy. These side effects raise concerns in patients as well as in doctors and are likely to reduce patients' adherence and, as a consequence, the cardiovascular benefit. Therefore, it is mandatory that clinicians improve their knowledge on the clinical aspects of muscular and hepatic side effects of statin therapy as well as their ability to manage patients with statin intolerance. Besides briefly examining the clinical aspects and the mechanisms that are proposed to be responsible for the most common statin-associated side effects, the main purpose of this article is to review the available approaches to manage statin-intolerant patients. The first step is to determine whether the adverse events are indeed related to statin therapy. If so, lowering the dosage or changing statin, alternate dosing options, or the use of nonstatin compounds may be practical strategies. The cholesterol-lowering potency as well as the usefulness of these different approaches in treating statin-intolerant patients will be examined based on currently available data. However, the cardiovascular benefit of these strategies has not been well established, so their use has to be guided by a careful clinical assessment of each patient.",

Clinical studies suggest that statins improve health outcomes of patients with pneumonia and ALI. The mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether statins attenuate systemic inflammation and cardiovascular dysfunction related to ALI in mice. Simvastatin (SS; 20 mg/kg) or vehicle solution was instilled intraperitoneally into mice 24 h before and again just prior to intratracheal LPS instillation (1 \u03bcg/g). These mice were then anesthetized with 2.0% isoflurane and underwent a short surgical procedure to instill LPS. Four hours later, IL-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in arterial and venous serum were measured. Cardiac function was evaluated using 2-D echocardiography, and endothelial function was determined using wire myography on aortic sections. LPS induced a significant increase in serum IL-6 levels. SS reduced venous (P = 0.040) but not arterial concentrations of IL-6 (P = 0.112). SS improved the maximal vasodilatory response of the aorta to ACh (P = 0.004) but not to sodium nitroprusside (P = 1.000). SS also improved cardiac output (P = 0.023). Vasodilatory response to ACh was impaired when aorta from untreated mice was incubated with ex vivo IL-6 (P = 0.004), whereas in the aorta from mice pretreated with SS, the vasodilatory response did not change with IL-6 incubation (P = 0.387). SS significantly improved LPS-induced cardiovascular dysfunction possibly by reducing systemic expression of IL-6 and its downstream signaling pathways. These findings may explain how statins improve health outcomes in patients with ALI.", 
    "75": "In mammalian cells, the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway, is ubiquitylated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome when mevalonate-derived metabolites accumulate, representing a case of metabolically regulated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Here, we studied which mevalonate-derived metabolites signal for HMGR degradation and the ERAD step(s) in which these metabolites are required. In HMGR-deficient UT-2 cells that stably express HMGal, a chimeric protein between \u03b2-galactosidase and the membrane region of HMGR, which is necessary and sufficient for the regulated ERAD, we tested inhibitors specific to different steps in the mevalonate pathway. We found that metabolites downstream of farnesyl pyrophosphate but upstream to lanosterol were highly effective in initiating ubiquitylation, dislocation, and degradation of HMGal. Similar results were observed for endogenous HMGR in cells that express this protein. Ubiquitylation, dislocation, and proteasomal degradation of HMGal were severely hampered when production of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate was inhibited. Importantly, inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation markedly attenuated ubiquitylation and dislocation, implicating for the first time a geranylgeranylated protein(s) in the metabolically regulated ERAD of HMGR.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of simvastatin on retinal neurons and the expression of apoptotic proteins in a rat IR model. Wistar rats received intravitreal injection of simvastatin immediately after retinal reperfusion. Retinal ischemia was induced by increasing intraocular pressure to 150 mm Hg for 60 min. The number of viable RGCs was measured after retrograde labeling with Fluoro-Gold. Ischemia-induced apoptotic cell death was studied using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). We found that simvastatin treatment enhanced RGC survival after retinal ischemia by approximately 40% and decreased retinal neuronal apoptosis. Using western blot analysis, we found that simvastatin upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 in the retina. In contrast, the level of the protein Bax was unaffected by simvastatin treatment. Our results suggest that RGC loss induced by retinal IR may be prevented by simvastatin and that the mechanism underlying this process possibly involves an alteration in the apoptotic pathway.",

Concentrations of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) are most often not remarkably abnormal. Based on this lipoprotein profile, it seems somewhat counterintuitive to prioritize LDL-C lowering in type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, \u224820 years of statins trials in >18,000 diabetic patients have unequivocally established this priority. Patients with type 2 diabetes without manifest atherosclerosis should reach an LDL-C goal <100 mg/dl or a Non-HDLcholesterol (NHDL-C) goal <130 mg/dl. If their baseline LDL-C is already between 70 and 100 mg/dl LDL-C should be lowered by 30 to 40%. Thus, the majority of these patients can be managed successfully with monotherapy using standard-intensity statins (e.g. simvastatin 40 mg/d). Patients with type 2 diabetes with manifest CHD should reach an LDL-C goal <70 mg/dl or an NHDL-C goal <100 mg/dl. A sizable fraction of these patients will require high-intensity statins (e.g. atorvastatin 80 mg/d or rosuvastatin 20-40 mg/d). If LDL-C goals are still not reached or high-intensity statins are not tolerated, combination of statins with ezetimibe is advisable. In patients with persistent pronounced dyslipidemic features, i.e. high TG/low HDL-C despite maximal lifestyle intervention and optimized statin dosage, pioglitazone should be incorporated in the antidiabetic management and combinations of statins with either niacin or fenofibrate should be considered. However, it has to be recognized that evidence supporting HDL-raising therapy is currently still much weaker than evidence supporting LDL lowering with statins.",

This study attempts to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying atorvastatin-induced autophagy in PC3 cells. PC3 cells were treated with atorvastatin, in combination with the inhibitors for transcription, protein translation, PI-3 kinase, mTOR, and MAP kinases. The atorvastatin-induced elevation of LC3-II was inhibited by both the translational and the transcriptional inhibitors, suggesting that the inhibition of geranylgeranyl biosynthesis by atorvastatin activates transcription of LC3, which results in elevation of LC3-II and activation of autophagy. RT-PCR and quantitative PCR assays showed that atorvastatin enhanced expression of LC3 mRNA, and addition of geranylgeraniol along with atorvastatin to the medium eliminated the enhancement, confirming the activation of transcription of LC3 is caused by atorvastatin-mediated inhibition of geranylgeranyl biosynthesis. Further, we found that both the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the JNK inhibitor SP600125, inhibited the atorvastatin-induced elevation of LC3-II, suggesting that the effect of atorvastatin on autophagy is mediated by the Erk and JNK pathways.

More specifically, in THP-1 macrophages StarD4 co-localized to areas of the ER enriched in Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1), and was closely associated with budding lipid droplets. The addition of purified StarD4 recombinant protein to an in vitro assay increased ACAT activity 2-fold, indicating that StarD4 serves as a rate-limiting step in cholesteryl ester formation by delivering cholesterol to ACAT-1-enriched ER. In addition, StarD4 protein was found to be highly regulated and to redistribute in response to sterol levels. In summary, these observations, together with our previous findings demonstrating the ability of increased StarD4 expression to increase bile acid synthesis and cholesteryl ester formation, provide strong evidence for StarD4 as a highly regulated, non-vesicular, directional, intracellular transporter of cholesterol which plays a key role in the maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.", 
    "104": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and neuropathology. Only acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and the NMDA antagonist memantine are approved for AD treatment. Recent preclinical and epidemiological studies proposed statins as novel therapeutics for AD, but the mechanisms of action are still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that atorvastatin (80 mg/d for 14.5 months) treatment resulted in an up-regulation of the inducible isoform of haem oxygenase (HO-1), an enzyme with significant neuroprotective activity. Atorvastatin selectively increased HO-1 in the parietal cortex but not cerebellum. In contrast, HO-2 was increased in cerebellum but not parietal cortex. No changes were observed in HO-1 or HO-2 in the liver. Significant negative correlations between HO-1 and oxidative stress indices and positive correlations with glutathione levels in parietal cortex were found. HO-1 up-regulation significantly correlated with lower discrimination learning error scores in aged beagles. Reference to therapeutic applications of atorvastatin in AD is discussed.",

However, there were important imbalances between groups, with more hospital-acquired infections, more need for surgery before ICU admission, and a trend towards more septic shock at ICU admission in the discontinuation group. The significant association of statin continuation with organ failure free days found in the crude analysis did not persist after propensity-matching or multivariable adjustment: beta coefficients [95% CI] of 2.37 [-0.96 to 5.70] (P = 0.20) and 2.24 [-0.43 to 4.91] (P = 0.11) respectively.

Experiments were designed to evaluate the efficacies atorvastatin and NSAIDs administered individually and in combination against colon tumor formation. F344 rats were fed AIN-76A diet, and colon tumors were induced with azoxymethane. One week after the second azoxymethane treatment, groups of rats were fed diets containing atorvastatin (200 ppm), sulindac (100 ppm), naproxen (150 ppm), or their combinations with low-dose atorvastatin (100 ppm) for 45 weeks. Administration of atorvastatin at 200 ppm significantly suppressed both adenocarcinoma incidence (52% reduction, P = 0.005) and multiplicity (58% reduction, P = 0.008). Most importantly, colon tumor multiplicities were profoundly decreased (80%-85% reduction, P < 0.0001) when given low-dose atorvastatin with either sulindac or naproxen. Also, a significant inhibition of colon tumor incidence was observed when given a low-dose atorvastatin with either sulindac (P = 0.001) or naproxen (P = 0.0005). Proliferation markers, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin D1, and \u03b2-catenin in tumors of rats exposed to sulindac, naproxen, atorvastatin, and/or combinations showed a significant suppression. Importantly, colon adenocarcinomas from atorvastatin and NSAIDs fed animals showed reduced key inflammatory markers, inducible nitric oxide synthase and COX-2, phospho-p65, as well as inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-4. Overall, this is the first report on the combination treatment using low-dose atorvastatin with either low-dose sulindac or naproxen, which greatly suppress the colon adenocarcinoma incidence and multiplicity.

Recently, however, we reported that aged dogs that underwent chronic statin treatment exhibited cognitive deficits compared with age matched controls. In human studies, blood levels of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) decrease with statin use. CoQ10 is important for proper mitochondrial function and is a powerful antioxidant, two important factors for cognitive health in aging. Thus, the current study tested the hypothesis that CoQ10 levels in the serum and/or parietal cortex are decreased in statin treated dogs and are associated with poorer cognition. Six aged beagles (>8 years) were administered 80 mg/day of atorvastatin for 14.5 months and compared with placebo-treated animals. As predicted, serum CoQ10 was significantly lower in statin-treated dogs. Parietal cortex CoQ10 was not different between the two groups. However, poorer cognition was correlated with lower parietal cortex CoQ10. This study in dogs suggests that serum CoQ10 is reduced with atorvastatin treatment. CoQ10 levels in brain may be linked to impaired cognition in response to atorvastatin, in agreement with previous reports that statins may have a negative impact on cognition in the elderly.",

    "134": "Despite the availability of excellent antibiotics, the mortality from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains substantial. Most deaths occur during the first week of hospitalization. Because antibiotics rapidly eradicate bacteria from pulmonary secretions, an ongoing inflammatory response may be responsible for the poor outcome, and treatment with immunomodulatory drugs might be beneficial in this setting. Macrolides and statins exert a broad range of anti-inflammatory effects. Although randomized control trials have not been done, clinical evidence favors the addition of a macrolide to a beta-lactam for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia and supports a role for macrolides in the treatment of all-cause CAP without regard to their anti-microbial activity. The weight of several retrospective studies suggests that statins be considered in treating acute CAP. Further support for the use of statins derives from the high association between pneumonia and acute myocardial infarction. Aspirin might also be of benefit in treating patients hospitalized for pneumonia because of its anti-inflammatory activity as well as its benefits in acute myocardial infarction. Treatment of CAP with corticosteroids has yielded mixed results and the value of this approach is not well established, although further research is currently underway. Ibuprofen is not of benefit in treating sepsis in humans and glitazones may increase the risk of severe pneumonia.", 
    "135": "The evidence of the different concepts underlying the interplay between cholesterol absorption and synthesis in the context of statin and ezetimibe treatment were reviewed in the light of the eight major trials where cholesterol absorption and synthesis were analyzed on a large scale using the plasma levels of precursors of cholesterol and plant sterols. The only concept supported in all studies is a significant and consistent increase of cholesterol absorption with statin (correlated with the inhibition of synthesis) and of cholesterol synthesis with ezetimibe, whereas in combination, statin and ezetimibe reduce both cholesterol synthesis and absorption. In contrast, most of the other concepts failed to be clearly proven. At baseline, the inverse relationship between cholesterol absorption and synthesis (only examined in two studies) was found to be weak. On statin treatment, four studies showed that the changes in cholesterol synthesis and absorption, contributed less than 9% to the variability in cholesterol response to statin therapy. It has not been consistently demonstrated that good absorbers/bad synthesizers are bad responders to statin (6 studies) and good responders for ezetimibe (3 studies). There is also no clear inverse correlation between LDL reduction on statin treatment and that on ezetimibe treatment. Finally, the original idea from the first pioneer study of Miettinen et al. that, the higher the baseline intestinal ability to absorb cholesterol, the lower the benefit on the clinical cardiovascular outcomes was not reproduced in the PROSPER study. In conclusion, with the exception of a reverse effect of statin and ezetimibe on absorption and synthesis, most ideas supporting the interplay between cholesterol absorption and synthesis lacked consistency between studies. At present, the use of the plasma levels of plant sterols and cholesterol precursors as markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis is far too limited to definitively solve these questions.", 
    "136": "We recently reported that the endogenous ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A7 strongly associates with phagocytosis, being regulated by sterol regulatory element binding protein 2. We therefore examined the effect of statins on phagocytosis in vitro and in vivo through the SREBP-ABCA7. Phagocytosis was found to be enhanced by pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin and cyclodextrin in J774 macrophages, as cellular cholesterol was reduced and expressions of the cholesterol-related genes were modulated, including an increase of ABCA7 mRNA and decrease of ABCA1 mRNA. Conversely, knock-down of ABCA7 expression by siRNA ablated enhancement of phagocytosis by statins. In vivo, pravastatin enhanced phagocytosis in wild-type mice, but not in ABCA7-knockout mice. We thus concluded that statins enhance phagocytosis through the SREBP-ABCA7 pathway. These findings provide a molecular basis for enhancement of the host-defense system by statins showing that one of their \"pleiotropic\" effects is in fact achieved through their reaction to a primary target.",

In the pooled analysis, the common mean difference of coronary atheroma volume between statin therapy and the placebo arm was -3.573 (confidence interval, -4.46 to -2.68; P<.01).

Dystrophic scoliosis and tibial pseudoarthrosis are the most severe skeletal manifestations for which treatment is not satisfactory, emphasizing the dearth of knowledge related to the biology of NF1 in bone cells. Using reporter mice, we report here that the mouse Col2\u03b11-Cre promoter (collagen, type II, alpha 1) is active not only in chondrocytes but also in adult bone marrow osteoprogenitors giving rise to osteoblasts. Based on this finding, we crossed the Col2\u03b11-Cre transgenic and Nf1(flox/flox) mice to determine whether loss of Nf1 in axial and appendicular osteochondroprogenitors recapitulates the skeletal abnormalities of NF1 patients. By microtomographic and X-rays studies, we show that Nf1(Col2)(-/-) mice display progressive scoliosis and kyphosis, tibial bowing and abnormalities in skull and anterior chest wall formation. These defects were accompanied by a low bone mass phenotype, high bone cortical porosity, osteoidosis, increased osteoclastogenesis and decreased osteoblast number, as quantified by histomorphometry and 3D-microtomography. Loss of Nf1 in osteochondroprogenitors also caused severe short stature and intervertebral disc defects. Blockade of the RAS/ERK activation characteristic of Nf1(-/-) osteoprogenitors by lovastatin during embryonic development could attenuate the increased cortical porosity observed in mutant pups. These data and the skeletal similarities between this mouse model and NF1 patients thus suggest that activation of the RAS/ERK pathway by Nf1 loss-of-function in osteochondroprogenitors is responsible for the vertebral and tibia lesions in NF1 patients, and that this molecular signature may represent a good therapeutic target.",

On the basis of the putative pathogenic role of both pathway-product deficiency of cholesterol and accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates, we assessed the efficacy of combined therapy with lovastatin and cholesterol. We also evaluated the basis for the poorly understood, unique lateralization of the cutaneous and bone malformations of CHILD syndrome by analyzing gene activation in abnormal and unaffected skin. Ultrastructural analysis of affected skin showed evidence of both cholesterol depletion and toxic metabolic accumulation. Topical treatment with lovastatin/cholesterol (but not cholesterol alone) virtually cleared skin lesions by 3 months, accompanied by histological and ultrastructural normalization of epidermal structure and lipid secretion. The unusual lateralization of abnormalities in CHILD syndrome reflects selective clearance of keratinocytes and fibroblasts that express the mutant allele from the unaffected side.

There were 427 matched pairs of patients. Primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative AF. Secondary outcomes were 30 day mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction and length of hospital stay. Results: The incidence of postoperative AF was not different in the statin users compared with the nonusers (123, 28.1%, versus 127, 29.7%, respectively; p = 0.764).

This confirmed that the mechanism of synergy in osteosarcoma cells is through augmented inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.

This recommendation was based on extensive epidemiological findings demonstrating a significant association between elevated plasma Lp(a) levels and coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. In addition to those patients considered to be at moderate to high risk of heart disease, statin-treated patients with recurrent heart disease were also identified as targeted for screening of elevated Lp(a) levels. Taken together, recent findings have significantly strengthened the notion of Lp(a) as a causal risk factor for CVD. It is well established that Lp(a) levels are largely determined by the size of the apolipoprotein a [apo(a)] gene; however, recent studies have identified several other LPA gene polymorphisms that have significant associations with an elevated Lp(a) level and a reduced copy number of K4 repeats. In addition, the contribution of other genes in regulating Lp(a) levels has been described. Besides the strong genetic regulation, new evidence has emerged regarding the impact of inflammation as a modulator of Lp(a) risk factor properties. Thus, oxidized phospholipids that possess a strong proinflammatory potential are preferentially carried on Lp(a) particles. Collectively, these findings point to the importance of both phenotypic and genotypic factors in influencing apo(a) proatherogenic properties. Therefore, studies taking both of these factors into account determining the amount of Lp(a) associated with each individual apo(a) size allele are valuable tools when assessing a risk factor role of Lp(a).",

CIMT was assayed in all participants by ultrasound. Patients were then treated with atorvastatin (10-80 mg) to target LDL <100 mg/dl. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glycemic and lipid profile, high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), apelin, visfatin and ghrelin were measured at baseline and after 12 months. Atorvastatin treatment significantly improved lipid profile across with increased apelin (from 0.307 \u00b1 0.130 pg/ml to 1.537 \u00b1 0.427 pg/ml; P < 0.001) and suppressed visfatin (from 21.54 \u00b1 10.14 ng/ml to 15.13 \u00b1 7.61 ng/ml; P = 0.002) serum levels in our diabetic patients.

Results. Switching to rosuvastatin 40\u2009mg/day was not associated with significant BP alterations. In contrast, the addition of ER-NA/laropiprant to current statin treatment resulted in a 7% reduction of systolic BP (from 134 \u00b1 12 to 125 \u00b1 10\u2009mmHg, P < .001 versus baseline and P = .01 versus rosuvastatin group) and a 5% reduction of diastolic BP (from 81 \u00b1 9 to 77 \u00b1 6\u2009mmHg, P = .009 versus baseline and P = .01 versus rosuvastatin group). These reductions were significant only in the subgroup of hypertensives and were independent of the hypolipidemic effects of ER-NA/laropiprant. Conclusions.
