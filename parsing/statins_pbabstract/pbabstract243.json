    "0": "Statins and fibrates have different effects on lipid abnormalities of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL); thus, the selection of the first-line drug is troublesome. We evaluated to what extent monotherapy with a potent statin is more effective than fibrate in reaching the recommended lipid targets in FCHL. Fifty-six patients were randomized to receive optimal dosage of atorvastatin (n = 27) or 200 mg/d micronized fenofibrate (n = 29) for 24 weeks. To reach the optimal dosage, atorvastatin was up-titrated at each follow-up visit if low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol >130 mg/dL (>100 mg/dL in patients with coronary or cerebrovascular disease). The effects of fenofibrate and atorvastatin on lipoprotein fractions as well as on plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and adrenomedullin (AM) were also evaluated. At end of trial, a greater proportion of patients on atorvastatin (average dosage, 20.8 mg/d) reached lipid targets in comparison with those on fenofibrate (64% vs 32.1%, P = .02). Atorvastatin was significantly more effective in reducing total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Conversely, triglycerides decreased and HDL increased more during fenofibrate. Nevertheless, atorvastatin produced a marked reduction in very low-density lipoprotein and very low-density lipoprotein remnants. Atorvastatin lowered all LDL subtypes, although fenofibrate appeared to be more effective on denser LDL. Compared with 43 normolipemic controls, FCHL patients presented increased baseline plasma levels of ET-1 (P = .007) but not of AM. Fenofibrate, but not atorvastatin, significantly lowered ET-1 levels by 16.7% (P < .05). Neither drug significantly affected plasma concentrations of AM. In summary, although fenofibrate showed superiority in raising HDL and reducing ET-1, atorvastatin was more effective in reaching lipid targets in FCHL so that it can be proposed as the first-line option in the management of this atherogenic hyperlipidemia.", 
    "1": "Niemann-Pick C disease (NPC) is a fatal, neurovisceral genetic disorder. Cell culture studies showed that NPC1 or NPC2 mutations cause malfunctions in cellular cholesterol trafficking and lead to accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the late endo/lysosomes. Previous work showed that neuronal cholesterol accumulation occurs in the brains of young postnatal NPC1-/- mice. Here, to evaluate the potential of partial blockage of cholesterol biosynthesis as a therapy for the NPC disease, we first developed a simple method to monitor the relative rates of lipid biosynthesis in mice brains. We next administered squalene synthase inhibitor (SSI) CP-340868 to young mice. The results show that treating 8-day-old NPC1-/- mice with CP-340868 for 6 days significantly inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis in the mice brains. It reduces neuronal cholesterol accumulation, reduces GM3 ganglioside accumulation, and diminishes astrogliosis in the brain. These results suggest that neuronal cholesterol accumulation contributes to early pathogenesis in the NPC1-/- mice brains. The SSI treatment also reduced brain galactolipid content, suggesting that blocking endogenous cholesterol synthesis in the young mice brains may disrupt the normal myelin maturation processes. The methods described in the current work have general applicability for lipid metabolism studies in mice brains in various pathophysiological conditions.", 
    "2": "Individuals with metabolic syndrome typically have atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by increased concentrations of triglycerides, reduced concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased concentrations of small dense low-density lipoprotein particles. Statins have been shown to improve atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with metabolic syndrome in a number of studies. Fibrates and niacin have also been shown to be effective therapy in these patients. Post hoc analyses suggest that lipid-regulating therapy reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with metabolic syndrome. Other approaches to the treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemia in these patients include targeting insulin resistance and adipose tissue. Agents such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist pioglitazone and the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant improve insulin resistance as well as atherogenic dyslipidemia. Weight loss has also been shown to improve risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome.",

Advocating lifestyle modification, faecal occult blood testing and surveillance colonoscopy in appropriate populations are already in practice. A developing concept is chemoprevention. Several models of carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer have been developed and there is an increasing database on the major molecular mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis mainly from preclinical experiments and phase I trials. There have been several large epidemiological and observational studies to evaluate possible protective effects of >200 agents. More recently, case-control and cohort studies and well-conceived, phase II/III clinical trials have been done or are under way to evaluate putative chemopreventive agents including established drugs like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 5-aminosalicylates and statins; more controversial drugs like cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, ursodeoxycholic acid; various vitamins and micronutrients including calcium, selenium, folic acid, and dietary fibre, fat and protein content. Despite promising outcome in preclinical studies, there is currently very limited data from well-controlled and appropriately powered clinical studies. The most promising agents currently are aspirin, traditional NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors. The recent reports of cardiovascular risks of the COX-2 inhibitors and some traditional NSAIDs have resulted in stagnation of the field. Pending the expected release of results from several phase III trials in the near future, chemoprevention for colorectal cancer can only be practically considered in the very-high-risk population like those with familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis, in conjunction with surveillance colonoscopy. This article reviews the major models of colorectal carcinogenesis, the concept of chemoprevention with special reference to colorectal cancer and the current state of clinical literature and the future direction of colorectal cancer chemoprevention for both researcher and clinician alike.",

Trials differed considerably in their inclusion criteria, outcomes measured, and type of lipid-lowering therapy used. Only one trial (PQRST) reported a detrimental effect of active treatment on blood lipid/lipoprotein levels. The pooled results from all eligible trials indicated that lipid-lowering therapy had no statistically significant effect on overall mortality (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.86; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.50) or on total cardiovascular events (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.09). However, subgroup analysis which excluded PQRST showed that lipid-lowering therapy significantly reduced the risk of total cardiovascular events (OR 0.74; CI 0.55 to 0.98). This was primarily due to a positive effect on total coronary events (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67 to 0.87). Greatest evidence of effectiveness came from the use of simvastatin in people with a blood cholesterol >/= 3.5 mmol/litre (HPS). Pooling of the results from several small trials on a range of different lipid-lowering agents indicated an improvement in total walking distance (Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) 152 m; 95% CI 32.11 to 271.88) and pain-free walking distance (WMD 89.76 m; 95% CI 30.05 to 149.47) but no significant impact on ankle brachial index (WMD 0.04; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.09).",

    "19": "Inactivating mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) gene, which encodes tuberin, result in the development of TSC and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The tumor suppressor effect of tuberin lies in its GTPase-activating protein activity toward Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), a Ras GTPase superfamily member. The statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, have pleiotropic effects which may involve interference with the isoprenylation of Ras and Rho GTPases. We show that atorvastatin selectively inhibits the proliferation of Tsc2-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts and ELT-3 smooth muscle cells in response to serum and estrogen, and under serum-free conditions. The isoprenoids farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) significantly reverse atorvastatin-induced inhibition of Tsc2-/- cell growth, suggesting that atorvastatin dually targets a farnesylated protein, such as Rheb, and a geranylgeranylated protein, such as Rho, both of which have elevated activity in Tsc2-/- cells. Atorvastatin reduced Rheb isoprenylation, GTP loading, and membrane localization. Atorvastatin also inhibited the constitutive phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin, S6 kinase, and S6 found in Tsc2-/- cells in an FPP-reversible manner and attenuated the high levels of phosphorylated S6 in Tsc2-heterozygous mice. Atorvastatin, but not rapamycin, attenuated the increased levels of activated RhoA in Tsc2-/- cells, and this was reversed by GGPP. These results suggest that atorvastatin may inhibit both rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-insensitive mechanisms of tuberin-null cell growth, likely via Rheb and Rho inhibition, respectively. Atorvastatin may have potential therapeutic benefit in TSC syndromes, including LAM.",

This study sought to better define underlying pathogenic mechanisms and to test whether maleate toxicity recapitulates critical components of the hypoxic/ischemic renal injury cascade. CD-1 mice were injected with maleate or used as a source for proximal tubule segments (PTS) for in vitro studies. Maleate induced dose-dependent PTS injury [lactate deydrogenase (LDH) release, ATP reductions, nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) accumulation]. These changes were partially dependent on maleate metabolism (protection conferred by metabolic inhibitors: succinate, acetoacetate). Maleate toxicity reproduced critical characteristics of the hypoxia/ATP depletion-induced injury cascade: 1) glutathione (GSH) conferred protection, but due to its glycine, not cysteine (antioxidant), content; 2) ATP reductions reflected decreased production, not Na-K-ATPase-driven increased consumption; 3) cell death was completely blocked by extracellular acidosis (pH 6.6); 4) intracellular Ca(2+) chelation (BAPTA) mitigated cell death; 5) maleate and hypoxia each caused plasma membrane cholesterol shedding and in both instances, this was completely glycine suppressible; 6) maleate + hypoxia caused neither additive NEFA accumulation nor LDH release, implying shared pathogenic pathways; and 7) maleate, like ischemia, induced renal cortical cholesterol loading; increased HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) activity (statin inhibitable), increased HMGCR mRNA levels, and increased RNA polymerase II recruitment to the HMGCR locus (chromatin immunoprecipitation, ChIP, assay) were involved. These results further define critical determinants of maleate nephrotoxicity and suggest that it can serve as a useful adjunct for studies of ischemia/ATP depletion-induced, proximal tubule-specific, cell death.",

After 6 months of therapy, FMD was increased by 44% in the atorvastatin plus diet group compared with the placebo plus diet group.

Part of the explanation for this paradox may be that, under certain conditions, HDL either can be less functional as an antioxidant or can even enhance the oxidation and inflammation associated with atherosclerotic plaque. Thus, the functional properties of HDL--not simply the level--may need to be considered and optimized.", 
    "32": "In the present work we investigated the in vitro effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate (HMG) that accumulates in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency (HMGLD) on important parameters of oxidative stress in rat cerebral cortex. It was observed that HMG induced lipid peroxidation by significantly increasing chemiluminescence and levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS). This effect was prevented by the antioxidants alpha-tocopherol, melatonin, N-acetylcysteine, and superoxide dismutase plus catalase, suggesting that free radicals were involved in the lipid oxidative damage. On the other hand, HMG did not change TBA-RS levels in intact or disrupted mitochondrial preparations, indicating that generation of oxidants by this organic acid was dependent on cytosolic mechanisms. HMG also induced protein oxidative damage in cortical supernatants, which was reflected by increased carbonyl content and sulfhydryl oxidation. Furthermore, HMG significantly reduced the nonenzymatic antioxidant defenses total-radical trapping antioxidant potential, total antioxidant reactivity, and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in rat cerebral cortex. HMG-induced GSH reduction was totally blocked by melatonin pretreatment. We also verified that the decrease of GSH levels provoked by HMG in cortical supernatants was not due to a direct oxidative effect of this organic acid, because exposition of commercial GSH and purified membrane protein-bound thiol groups to HMG in the absence of cortical supernatants did not decrease the reduced sulfhydryl groups. Finally, the activities of the main antioxidant enzymes were not altered by HMG exposure. Our data indicate that oxidative stress elicited in vitro by HMG may possibly contribute at least in part to the pathophysiology of the brain injury in HMGLD.", 
    "33": "The present study aimed to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on the intravenous and oral pharmacokinetics of verapamil in rats. The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil were measured after an oral (9 mg/kg) or intravenous (3 mg/kg) administration of verapamil to rats in the presence and absence of atorvastatin. Compared with the control given verapamil alone, the concurrent use of 1.5 mg/kg of atorvastatin significantly increased the oral exposure of verapamil in rats. The AUC and C(max) of verapamil increased by 70% and 61%, respectively in the presence of atorvastatin (1.5 mg/kg), while there was no significant change in T(max) and the terminal plasma half-life (T(1/2)) of verapamil. Accordingly, the presence of atorvastatin significantly (p<0.05) increased the bioavailability of verapamil in rats. In contrast, atorvastatin had no effect on any pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil given intravenously, implying that atorvastatin may improve the oral bioavailability of verapamil by reducing the prehepatic extraction of verapamil most likely mediated by P-gp and/or CYP3A4. In conclusion, coadministration of atorvastatin significantly enhanced the oral exposure of verapamil in rats without a change in the systemic clearance of intravenous verapamil, suggesting a potential drug interaction between verapamil and atorvastatin via the modulation of prehepatic extraction.",

    "35": "Bacterial peritonitis is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis patients and of patients after abdominal surgery. Especially episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus can harm the peritoneum severely, resulting in peritoneal fibrosis. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of the peritoneum, as they release components of the fibrinolytic system and regulate the influx of immune cells by expressing chemokines and adhesion molecules. Using cultured human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HMCs) and blood mononuclear cells, we analyzed the effect of different staphylococcal strains on mesothelial fibrinolysis and on inflammatory reactions and show that only S. aureus strains with an invasive and hemolytic phenotype decrease the production of fibrinolytic system components, most likely via cell death induction. Furthermore, HMCs react to invading staphylococci by enhanced expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules. Mononuclear cells were activated by all staphylococcal strains tested, and their culture supernatants impaired mesothelial fibrinolysis. Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, efficiently enhanced the mesothelial fibrinolytic capacity under these inflammatory conditions, but did not protect HMCs against S. aureus-induced cell death. We conclude that only selected S. aureus strains decrease the release of fibrinolytic system components and provoke a mesothelial inflammatory response. These factors most likely contribute to peritoneal fibrosis and might account for the severe clinical presentation of S. aureus peritonitis.", 
    "36": "Lipid-modifying therapy has been proven to significantly reduce cardiovascular events and total mortality. Most of the data have come from statin trials. Statin therapy is generally well-tolerated and safe, and for patients who are at higher than average risk of cardiovascular disease, the benefit of lipid-modifying therapy far exceeds the risk. Careful risk assessment is a critical component of effective lipid-modifying therapy. In the foreseeable future, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) will remain the primary therapeutic target, and combination therapy is likely to become the norm. The major questions are how low to treat and how to achieve increasingly aggressive targets in lipid-lowering therapy. Many patients on LDL-lowering therapy continue to have abnormalities of the triglyceride-high-density lipoprotein (TG-HDL) axis, so additional drug therapy is often considered for such patients. In this review, we briefly discuss new developments in cardiovascular risk assessment, then discuss recent developments in treatment to reduce LDL, and finally discuss current concepts regarding therapy targeting the TG-HDL axis.",

An in-depth analysis of the COURAGE trial design and execution is provided.", 
    "39": "Studies have indicated that protective effects of statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) are associated with the regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) or inducible NOS (iNOS) in heart and liver diseases. Statins have been reported to enhance hepatic NO production and decrease the vascular tone in patients with cirrhosis. However, it is unclear which NOS contributes to the increased NO production. We hypothesized that statins are involved in the up-regulation of iNOS in inflammatory liver, resulting in decreased hepatic resistance. Primary cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta in the presence or absence of pitavastatin. Pretreatment of cells with pitavastatin resulted in up-regulation of iNOS induction by IL-1beta, followed by increased NO production. Pitavastatin had no effects on the degradation of IkappaB or activation of NF-kappaB. However, pitavastatin super-induced the up-regulation of type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), which is essential for iNOS induction in addition to the IkappaB/NF-kappaB pathway. Mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate blocked the stimulatory effects of pitavastatin on iNOS and IL-1RI induction. Transfection experiments revealed that pitavastatin increased the stability of iNOS mRNA rather than its promoter transactivation. In support of this observation, pitavastatin increased the antisense-transcript corresponding to the 3'-UTR of iNOS mRNA, which stabilizes iNOS mRNA by interacting with the 3'-UTR- and RNA-binding proteins. These findings demonstrate that pitavastatin up-regulates iNOS by the stabilization of its mRNA, presumably through the super-induction of IL-1RI and antisense-transcript. This implies that statins may contribute to a novel potentiated treatment in liver injuries including cirrhosis.", 
    "40": "Increasing evidence suggest that the 'quality' rather than only the 'quantity' of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) exerts a great influence on the cardiovascular risk. Small, dense LDL seem to be an important predictor of cardiovascular events and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) and their predominance has been accepted as an emerging cardiovascular risk factor by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III.", 
    "41": "Some studies showed in past years that small, dense LDL are usually elevated in patients at very high cardiovascular risk, such as those with CAD and type 2 diabetes. More recently elevated levels of these particles have been found in other categories of patients at high cardiovascular risk, such as those with non-coronary forms of atherosclerosis (e.g. with carotid artery disease, aortic abdominal aneurysm and peripheral arterial disease) and metabolic diseases (with polycystic ovary syndrome and growth hormone deficiency); notably, in most of them, the predominance of small, dense LDL characterised their type of dyslipidaemia, alone or in combination with elevated triglycerides and reduced high-density lipoproteins cholesterol concentrations.", 
    "42": "The therapeutical modulation of small, dense LDL have been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular risk and weight reduction and increased physical activity may constitute first-line therapy. In addition, lipid-lowering drugs are able to favourably alter these particles and fibrates and nicotinic acid seem to be the most effective agents. Promising data are also available with the use of rosuvastatin, the latest statin introduced in the market, and ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor.", 
    "43": "Substantial residual cardiovascular risk persists despite effective LDL lowering treatment in populations at elevated risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Low HDL cholesterol is an independent cardiovascular risk factor and occurs in about one-third of patients treated for dyslipidaemia in Europe. Moreover, randomised intervention studies have shown that increasing HDL cholesterol improves cardiovascular outcomes. Correcting low HDL cholesterol therefore presents a rational and proven strategy for intervention to produce further reductions in cardiovascular risk beyond those possible with a statin alone. Nicotinic acid (niacin in the USA) is the most effective agent currently available for increasing levels of HDL cholesterol.", 
    "44": "A once-daily, prolonged-release formulation of nicotinic acid (Niaspan) is as effective on HDL cholesterol as the immediate-release formulation, and is equally effective at increasing HDL cholesterol whether or not patients are already taking a statin. Niaspan also shares the antiatherogenic benefit of nicotinic acid, and induced regression of atherosclerosis in patients with cardiovascular disease during a period of treatment of up to 2 years. The incidence of flushing, the principal side effect of nicotinic acid, is lower with Niaspan than with immediate-release nicotinic acid. Simple practical measures are available to minimise the incidence and impact of flushing, including careful dose titration and avoiding hot or spicy foods near the time of ingestion of Niaspan. The potential for hepatotoxicity, muscle toxicity or marked exacerbation of hyperglycaemia in diabetes with Niaspan is very low, with or without concomitant statin treatment.",

    "50": "Stroke remains a global leading cause of death and long-term disability, highlighting the need for more effective treatment approaches. The majority of strokes are of ischemic origin, often caused by large- or small-artery atherothrombosis, or cardioembolism. Considering the systemic nature of the atherothrombotic disease process, stroke patients are at increased risk for ischemic events in several vascular territories: cerebral, coronary and peripheral. Due to the limited options for acute stroke therapies, stroke prevention is an important therapeutic approach. In addition to the management of modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and smoking through pharmacotherapy or lifestyle adjustments, anticoagulants, surgical and perhaps endovascular approaches are indicated in certain patients. Antiplatelet therapies using various agents are a cornerstone of secondary stroke prevention. To ensure the appropriate continuum of care after hospitalization for ischemic stroke, some interventions for the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke should be initiated during the acute hospitalization setting and maintained in the out-patient setting.", 
    "51": "The slow coronary flow (SCF) phenomenon is a coronary microvascular disorder characterized by the delayed passage of contrast in the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary disease. Recent studies showed the possible role of endothelial dysfunction, diffuse atherosclerosis and inflammation in the pathogenesis of this phenomenon. We aimed to investigate the effect of statin on myocardial perfusion in patients with SCF.", 
    "52": "The study population consisted of 97 patients with SCF. Coronary flow patterns of the cases are determined by thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) frame count method. Single-photon emission computed tomographic myocardial perfusion imaging studies and lipid parameters of the patients were obtained before and after 6 months of simvastatin treatment period. During the study, daily single dose of 40 mg simvastatin has been given to each subject. We found a significant positive correlation between mean TIMI frame count and basal reversibility score (r = 0.84, p = 0.0001). In addition, analysis of the reversibility scores demonstrates that simvastatin treatment has significantly improved the myocardial perfusion abnormality at the end of the follow-up period.",

    "54": "Cerebral vasospasm, a recognized complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, can lead to delayed ischaemic neurological deficit, and death. The systematic administration of nimodipine confers a modest but real benefit against delayed ischaemic damage. When vasospasm occurs, triple-H therapy (hypervolaemia, hypertension, and haemodilution) has long been advocated in order to increase flow, but its usefulness remains unclear. Cardiac output optimization using inotropic drugs might also be considered in selected patients. In practice, only correction of volume depletion and induced hypertension (after aneurysm has been secured) can be recommended. In addition, according to phase II randomized trials, promising new treatments for vasospasm or its ischaemic complications include magnesium sulfate, the selective endothelin A-receptor antagonist clazosentan, and statins. The simple and safe profile of prophylactic use of statins appears particularly attractive. However, all these potential candidates need further validation through (on-going) clinical phase III trials.", 
    "55": "Sepsis, which is the product of a poorly controlled inflammatory response, is a major health problem. Adequate therapies for sepsis are unavailable, and patient care is mainly supportive. Statins, widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, have been found to be antiinflammatory, but the mechanisms responsible for this alteration in the inflammatory response are not well understood. We investigated the effect of statins on CD14 expression, the major binding site for bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the macrophage surface. CD14 is found in both a membrane-bound form on the cell surface (mCD14) and in a soluble variant in circulation (sCD14). Treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with lovastatin resulted in elevated mCD14 levels and decreased sCD14 levels after LPS stimulation. The increase in mCD14 was dependent on depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and subsequent inhibition of Rho GTPases, whereas the effect of lovastatin on sCD14 was independent of this pathway. The increase in mCD14 expression correlated with an enhanced response to LPS, at least at the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha secretion. These results suggest that statin treatment can modulate macrophage functon, which may have an impact on inflammation and the outcome from sepsis.",

All patients were also given aspirin and were followed for 90 days. Descriptive analyses were done by intention to treat. The primary outcome was total stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) within 90 days. Safety outcomes included haemorrhage related to clopidogrel and myositis related to simvastatin. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial (number 35624812) and with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00109382).", 
    "58": "The median time to stroke outcome was 1 day (range 0-62 days). The trial was stopped early due to a failure to recruit patients at the prespecified minimum enrolment rate because of increased use of statins. 14 (7.1%) patients on clopidogrel had a stroke within 90 days compared with 21 (10.8%) patients on placebo (risk ratio 0.7 [95% CI 0.3-1.2]; absolute risk reduction -3.8% [95% CI -9.4 to 1.9]; p=0.19). 21 (10.6%) patients on simvastatin had a stroke within 90 days compared with 14 (7.3%) patients on placebo (risk ratio 1.3 [0.7-2.4]; absolute risk increase 3.3% [-2.3 to 8.9]; p=0.25). The interaction between clopidogrel and simvastatin was not significant (p=0.64). Two patients on clopidogrel had intracranial haemorrhage compared with none on placebo (absolute risk increase 1.0% [-0.4 to 2.4]; p=0.5). There was no difference between groups for the simvastatin safety outcomes.", 
    "59": "Immediately after TIA or minor stroke, patients are at high risk of stroke, which might be reduced by using clopidogrel in addition to aspirin. The haemorrhagic risks of the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel do not seem to offset this potential benefit. We were unable to provide evidence of benefit of simvastatin in this setting.

Plasma visfatin levels were determined at baseline and after 12-weeks post-randomization. Rosuvastatin induced a significant decrease in plasma visfatin levels (17.1+/-2.1 versus 15.5+/-2.0 ng/ml, P=0.03).

Colesevelam hydrochloride (HCL) has become the preferred drug of this class due to fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects. This article reviews the use of colesevelam in the treatment of dyslipidemia. Bile-acid sequestrants are a class of drugs developed to lower LDL-C levels. Two of the bile-acid sequestrants, colestyramine resin and colestipol, have been used since the 1980s, and have proven effective and safe as nonsystemic approaches to cholesterol reduction. However, tolerability and compliance issues related to palatability and gastrointestinal side effects have limited the use of these sequestrants. Colesevelam HCL (Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., Parsippany, NJ) is a nonabsorbed lipid-lowering agent that can be used in monotherapy or in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to reduce LDL-C in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Fredrickson type IIa).

In each patient, simvastatin at 10 mg/day was administered for 12 weeks. The other treatments were unchanged at least 3 months before simvastatin administration to the end of the study. Patients were assessed for the improvement in clinical, laboratory, and immunological parameters of RA and for adverse events. Twenty-four patients with RA were enrolled. Clinical symptoms, including patient's assessment of pain and disease activity on visual analog scale (VAS), the swollen joint and tender joint counts, and handgrip strength significantly improved. Physician's assessment of disease activity on VAS, a period of morning stiffness and modified health assessment questionnaire showed a tendency of improving after administration of low-dosage of simvastatin. Of special interest was that the median levels of erythrocytes sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and rheumatoid factor were significantly decreased from 54.0 mm/h to 45.5 mm/h, from 1.50 mg/dl to 0.85 mg/dl, and from 57.0 IU/ml to 28.0 IU/ml, respectively, after administration of simvastatin. ACR20 and ACR50 responses were achieved in 62% and 38%, respectively, of simvastatin-treated patients for 12 weeks. Immunological assessment in peripheral blood revealed that the Th1/Th2 and CD4/CD8 ratios were significantly reduced by simvastatin. No adverse events were reported during simvastatin treatment. Immunomodulation through the alteration of Th1/Th2 and CD4/CD8 ratios may be a pharmacological mechanism in the anti-rheumatic effect of low-dosage simvastatin. Although it is necessary to evaluate the long-term effects of statins, low-dosage statins appear to be good as additional therapeutic agents.", 
    "71": "Synergy study with chemotherapeutic agents is a common in vitro strategy in the search for effective cancer therapy. For non-chemotherapeutic agents, efficacious synergistic effects are uncommon. Here, we have examined two non-chemotherapeutic agents for synergistic effects: lovastatin and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) for synergistic effects; on three human malignant glioblastoma cell lines, M059K, M59J, and A172. Cells treated with lovastatin plus TRAIL for 48 h showed 50% apoptotic cell death, whereas TRAIL alone (1,000 ng/ml) did not, suggesting that lovastatin sensitized the glioblastoma cells to TRAIL attack. Cell cycle analysis indicated that lovastatin increased G0-G1 arrest in these cells. Annexin V study demonstrated that apoptosis was the predominant mode of cell death. We conclude that the combination of lovastatin and TRAIL enhances apoptosis synergistically. Moreover, lovastatin sensitized glioblastoma cells to TRAIL, suggesting a new strategy to treat glioblastoma.",

The 4-week ambulatory educational program consisted of a physical education with 22 meetings of cardiac rehabilitation (ergo cycle, carpet, segmentary muscular work, steps and balneotherapy) and a therapeutic and dietetic education (18 courses and cooking workshops, supermarket visits and self BP measurement). These 131 patients were re-examined 3, 6 and 12 months after by the paramedical team. The GP and nurses were taught recommendations on CV risk factors management. The patients were followed by a computerized medical file. BP (average of 3 measurements by OMRON M4), total cholesterol (CT), weight, physical activity (insufficient if less than 3 walks of 30 min per week), smoking and drugs intake were analyzed on J0 then at one year and were compared with the French results of EuroAspire II.

    "75": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes chronic hepatitis and leads to liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Pegylated-interferon and ribavirin is the current standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C. However, the therapy is only effective in 50% of the patients. To overcome this problem, we recently developed the HCV cell culture system (OR6 system) for the screening of anti-HCV reagents. In this OR6 system, the luciferase gene was introduced into the upstream portion of the HCV genome to facilitate the monitoring of HCV RNA replication. Recently lipid metabolism is reported to be involved in HCV RNA replication. Cholesterol and sphingolipid are the major components in lipid rafts, which seem to be the scaffold for HCV RNA replication. Statins inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis and also have the pleiotropic effects by the inhibition of prenylation. We demonstrated different anti-HCV effects of statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, and pitavastatin) using the OR6 system. Surprisingly, in contrast to the other statins, pravastatin exhibited no anti-HCV effect. Furthermore, statins enhanced the anti-HCV effect of interferon in combination. Statins may be a promising candidate for the adjuvant in interferon therapy and may improve the efficiency of the current interferon and ribavirin therapy.", 
    "76": "Endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis are associated with an inflammation-induced decrease in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. Based on the differences between hydrophobic and hydrophilic statins in their reduction of cardiac events, we analyzed the effects of rosuvastatin and cerivastatin on eNOS and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression and NOS activity in TNF-alpha-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Both statins reversed down-regulation of eNOS mRNA and protein expression by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and isoprenoid synthesis. Cerivastatin tended to a more pronounced effect on eNOS expression compared to rosuvastatin. NOS activity - measured by conversion of [(3)H]-L-arginine to [(3)H]-L-citrulline - was enhanced under treatment with both drugs due to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Statin-treatment reduced iNOS mRNA expression under normal conditions, but had no relevant effects on iNOS mRNA expression in cytokine-treated cells. Rosuvastatin and cerivastatin reverse the detrimental effects of TNF-alpha-induced down-regulation in eNOS protein expression and increase NO synthase activity by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and subsequent blocking of isoprenoid synthesis. These results provide evidence that statins have beneficial effects by increasing eNOS expression and activity during the atherosclerotic process.",

    "81": "Recent work has suggested that statins may exert beneficial effects on patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pharmacological effects of statins extend beyond their cholesterol-lowering properties. Based on the antineoplastic and apoptotic effects of statins in several cell types, we hypothesized that statins may be able to protect neurons by controlling the regulation of cell cycle. A growing body of evidence indicates that neurodegeneration involves the activation of cell cycle machinery in postmitotic neurons. We and others have presented direct evidence to support the hypothesis that the failure of cell cycle control is not restricted to neurons in AD patients, but that it occurs in peripheral cells as well. For these reasons, we found it worthy to study the role of simvastatin on cell proliferation in immortalized lymphocytes from AD patients. We report here that simvastatin (SIM) inhibits the serum-mediated enhancement of cell proliferation in AD by blocking the events critical for G(1)/S transition. SIM induces a partial blockade of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation and inhibition of cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2 activity associated with increased levels of the CDK inhibitors p21(Cip1) and p27(kip1). These effects of SIM on AD lymphoblasts are dependent on inhibition of the proteasome-mediated degradation of p21 and p27 proteins. The antiproliferative effect of this natural statin may provide a therapeutic approach for AD disease.", 
    "82": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been suggested as an important mediator of the cholesterol-independent cytoprotection actions of statins, which may be of benefit for the treatment of degenerative neurological diseases and for reduction of infarct volume after cerebral ischemia. Overexpression of HO-1, however, has dual effects under oxidative stress, and the release of ferric iron from heme under these conditions may result in detrimental rather than cytoprotective effects. This study was designed to investigate the effect of simvastatin-induced HO-1 on Neuro 2A cells in response to glucose deprivation. We demonstrated that simvastatin induced a dose- and time-dependent upregulation of HO-1 protein expression in Neuro 2A cells. The induction of HO-1 after simvastatin treatment was mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which was expressed by Western blots of nuclear fractions and retarded complex formation in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction. In addition, simvastatin activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38, but not the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and Akt. Glucose deprivation in the cells pretreated with simvastatin induced more HO-1 expression, and the transcript could be decreased by small interfering RNA for Nrf2. This upregulation of HO-1 was significantly associated with increased apoptosis, manifested as expression at the protein level of 17-kDa cleaved caspase-3 and increased percentage of apoptotic cells shown by flow cytometry. The increased cleaved caspase-3 expression and percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced by the HO inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin. Addition of the iron chelator desferrioxamine also resulted in blockade of the aggravated apoptosis, which implies that iron production from HO-1 activity may play an important role in the increased apoptosis in response to glucose deprivation in neuronal cells pretreated with simvastatin.", 
    "83": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), by exerting anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, antiapoptotic and antioxidant effects in the vasculature, protects against atherosclerosis and post-transplant vasculopathy. We noted the overlap between the effects of HO-1 and those attributed to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins). This led to an investigation of the role of HO-1 in statin-mediated cytoprotection in primary human endothelial cells (ECs), and the ability of Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) to regulate HO-1 function.", 
    "84": "Treatment of human umbilical vein and aortic ECs with atorvastatin significantly upregulated HO-1 promoter activity, mRNA expression and protein expression, increasing HO-1 enzymatic activity as shown by raised intracellular bilirubin IXalpha. This effect was indirect, dependent upon inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and geranylgeranylation, and independent of nitric oxide or changes in mRNA stability. Atorvastatin protected ECs against the generation of reactive oxygen species and H(2)O(2)-induced injury. HO-1 inhibition, with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or zinc protoporphyrin IX, abrogated atorvastatin-mediated cytoprotection. Atorvastatin upregulated KLF2 expression, whereas KLF2 siRNA attenuated statin-induced HO-1 and its associated antioxidant cytoprotective effects. Iron chelation, adenoviral-mediated overexpression of ferritin or supplementation of culture media with biliverdin reversed the inhibitory effects of HO-1 and KLF2 siRNA, suggesting that bile pigments and ferritin mediate the antioxidant actions of statin-induced HO-1.", 
    "85": "We have identified a novel link between KLF2 and HO-1 in human vascular ECs, demonstrating that atorvastatin-mediated HO-1 upregulation, and its associated antioxidant effect, is KLF2-dependent.

Pitavastatin achieves its potent pharmacologic action by strongly binding and inhibiting the active site of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, and has potent low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol-lowering effects similar to atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. One other characteristic of the agent is that pitavastatin is minimally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozymes; it undergoes glucuronidation and is converted to the inactive lactone form, and, therefore, the incidence of any drug interactions is reduced. Due to the promising results observed in clinical trials, it has the potential to be an excellent addition to the worldwide lipid management market.", 
    "87": "This review considers the treatment for combined hyperlipidaemia (CH) with a combination formulation of three drugs: a statin, nicotinic acid (NA) and aspirin--a mini-polypill. CH is a highly atherogenic dyslipidaemia manifested either as familial combined hyperlipidaemia or dyslipidaemia related to the metabolic syndrome or Type 2 diabetes mellitus. These types of dyslipidaemia are highly prevalent in the general population. Statin plus extended-release NA is a promising treatment option for the normalisation of these atherogenic lipid alterations, regression of atherosclerosis, as well as for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. The addition of aspirin might prove a useful adjunct that might reduce the cutaneous side effects of NA while also acting as an antiplatelet agent in high-CVD-risk patients. However, the effective dose of aspirin may need to be at least 160 mg/day. This triple combination might improve patient compliance when compared with the three drugs administered separately.", 
    "88": "Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (statins) are cholesterol-lowering agents that dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with established cardiovascular disease. In addition, they exhibit pleiotropic effects that operate independently of lipid modification. Statin administration results in greater nitric oxide bioavailability, improved endothelial function, enhanced cerebral blood flow, immune modulation with anti-inflammatory action, decreased platelet aggregation and antioxidant activity. Some or all of these effects may improve outcome or ameliorate symptoms in neurological disorders. This article examines the potential role of statins in treating stroke, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Studies are ongoing in this controversial area, but there are no firm conclusions. The appropriateness of initiating statin therapy for neurological disorders is not established at this time. The exception is stroke, in which recurrence is significantly reduced by statin therapy.",

EPC number declined with age (p = 0.013), was significantly lower in women (p = 0.006) and higher in subjects on statin, hormone replacement or ACE inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor blockers, and correlated positively with moderate alcohol consumption. Unexpectedly, a positive relation between EPC number and several vascular risk factors emerged. In a step forward multivariate linear regression analysis EPC number was independently related with SDF1alpha, MMP-9, triglycerides, alcohol consumption, and Hba1c. EPC-CFU in turn was related to SDF1alpha and diastolic blood pressure. Moreover, EPC number showed a significant positive association with the Framingham risk score (P = 0.001). Finally, there was an inverse association between EPC number and common carotid artery intima-media thickness (p = 0.02) and the carotid artery atherosclerosis score (p = 0.059).",

EPC number increases with the cardiovascular risk estimated by the Framingham risk score (FRS), which in the absence of similar changes for EPC-CFU. Finally, we demonstrate a significant inverse association between EPC number and extent of carotid atherosclerosis even though this association was only of moderate strength and not entirely consistent in other vascular territories.",

The proportions of statin use increased 3.3-fold from 20.8% of all LLDs in 1997 to 69.0% in 2003. With the continuous increase in the use of statins, by 2001, they replaced fibrates as the most heavily used LLDs. Monotherapy was the most prominent prescribing pattern comprising 98.1% and 98.3% of all LLD prescriptions in 1997 and 2003, respectively. Among patients with diabetic dyslipidemia plus CHD, the use of statins increased almost threefold instead of a large reduction in the percentage with non-statin class.",

Children and adolescents with high cholesterol levels are more likely than their peers to present cholesterol elevation as adults. The identification of genetic dyslipidemias associated with premature cardiovascular disease is crucial during childhood to delay or prevent the atherosclerotic process. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of hypercholesterolemia during pediatric age are available from the National Cholesterol Education Program. A heart-healthy diet should begin at the age of 2 yr and a large number of studies have demonstrated no adverse effects on nutritional status, growth, pubertal development, and psychological aspects in children and adolescents limiting total and saturated fat intake. Pharmacotherapy should be considered in children over 10 yr of age when LDL cholesterol concentrations remain very high despite severe dietary therapy, especially when multiple risk factors are present. The only lipid-lowering drugs recommended up to now for childhood and adolescence are resins reported to be effective and well tolerated, although compliance is very poor because of unpalatability. The use of statins is increasing and seems to be effective and safe in children, even if studies enrolled a small number of patients and evaluated efficacy and safety for short-term periods. Recently, an interesting drug represented by ezetimibe has been found that may provide cholesterol-lowering additive to that reached with statin treatment. This review provides an update on recent advances in the diagnosis, therapy, and follow-up of familial hypercholesterolemia during pediatric age and adolescence.",

The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that pravastatin reduced the incidence of CHD (hazard ratio=0.67; 95 per cent confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.91) and of stroke events, which was the secondary endpoint in the MEGA study (hazard ratio=0.83; 95 per cent CI: 0.57-1.21). Owing to considerable treatment changes, it is also of interest to estimate the causal effect of treatment that would have been observed had all patients complied with the treatment to which they were assigned. In this paper, we present an intensity score method developed for clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes that correct for treatment changes during follow-up. The proposed method can be easily extended to the estimation of time-dependent treatment effects, where the technique of g-estimation has been difficult to apply in practice. We compared the performances of the proposed method with other methods (as-treated, ITT, and g-estimation analysis) through simulation studies, which showed that the intensity score estimator was unbiased and more efficient. Applying the proposed method to the MEGA study data, several prognostic factors were associated with the process of treatment changes, and after adjusting for these treatment changes, larger treatment effects for pravastatin were observed for both CHD and stroke events. The proposed method provides a valuable and flexible approach for estimating treatment effect adjusting for non-random non-compliance.", 
    "116": "Statins have been reported to affect blood vessel formation. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a multifunctional protein that affects vasculature systems such as platelet activation, angiogenesis, and wound healing. This study was designed to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on TSP-1 synthesis in thrombin-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and its regulation by mevalonate or its derivatives. The results showed that atorvastatin down-regulated TSP-1 expression in HUVECs. This effect was fully reversed by mevalonate, farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), and gerarylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP). Furthermore, farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitors decreased TSP-1expression. It was also found that thrombin increased TSP-1 expression in HUVECs. Atorvastatin (0.1, 1, and 10 muM) decreased TSP-1 in thrombin-stimulated cells (45%, 66%, and 80%). Mevalonate partially reversed this inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on TSP-1, whereas the presence of FPP and GGPP did not alter TSP-1. Rho-kinase inhibitor neutralized the up-regulation of TSP-1 induced by thrombin. In conclusion, atorvastatin inhibits TSP-1 expression in endothelial cells via the mevalonate pathway. Rho protein activation is necessary for up-regulation of TSP-1 synthesis induced by thrombin. Because FPP and GGPP are essential for the activity of Rho proteins, inhibition of these proteins may constitute the mechanism by which atorvastatin inhibits thrombin up-regulated TSP-1 expression.",

Rapid improvement in muscle strength accompanied by prompt resolution of abnormal elevation of muscle enzymes followed cessation of both medications. Both colchicine and statin therapy may be associated with myopathy, which usually occurs after several months of therapy. The concomitant use, however, of colchicine and statin has been associated with the rapid onset of muscle weakness. Four patients with similar clinical and laboratory characteristics to our patient's after the combined use of colchicine and statins have been described in the literature.

Seventy-five hyperlipidemic patients with and without type 2 diabetes were enrolled to receive pitavastatin 2 mg daily. Cell adhesion molecules (sCD40L, sP-selectin, sE-selectin, and sL-selectin), chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES) and adiponectin were measured at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of pitavastatin treatment. Adiponectin levels prior to pitavastatin treatment in hyperlipidemic patients with and without diabetes were lower than levels in normolipidemic controls. Both total cholesterol and the LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased significantly after pitavastatin administration. Additionally, hyperlipidemic patients with type 2 diabetes exhibited a significant increase in adiponectin levels after pitavastatin treatment (before vs. 3 months, 6 months, 2.81+/-0.95 vs. 3.84+/-0.84 microg/ml (p<0.01), 4.61+/-1.15 mug/ml (p<0.001)).

In addition, adiponectin showed significant correlation with sE-selectin and sL-selectin in diabetic hyperlipidemia. However, MCP-1, RANTES and sCD40L did not exhibit any differences before or after pitavastatin administration. These results suggest that pitavastatin possesses an adiponectin-dependent anti-atherosclerotic effect in hyperlipidemic patients with type 2 diabetes in addition to its lowering effects on total cholesterol and LDL-C.",

In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model for multiple sclerosis, statins prevented disease onset and even reversed paralysis when treatment was initiated after experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was fully established. Furthermore, well-tolerated oral statins were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in combination with existing agents for multiple sclerosis therapy.

CRP decreased significantly versus baseline in both treatment groups. Significantly more patients treated with rosuvastatin achieved the combined end point of LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl and CRP <2 mg/L compared with atorvastatin by the end of the study period (58% vs 37%; p <0.001 vs atorvastatin).

The PREDICT study aims to evaluate prediction of cardiovascular events by CACS in Type 2 diabetic subjects without previous clinical cardiovascular disease. In the present PREDICT sub-study, the rate of progression of CACS and factors influencing this rate were assessed. CACS was measured at baseline and after a mean interval of 4.0 (range of 2.1-5.0) years in the 202 PREDICT participants who agreed to have a second scan. Participants also had a range of conventional and novel biochemical risk factors measured at baseline. Progression of calcification was apparent in 170 (84%), while in 32 (16%) there was regression or no progression. Those showing progression had a significantly more adverse risk factor profile. Rate of change in CACS was strongly related to baseline CACS (p<0.0001). Rate of change also correlated with, waist:hip ratio (p=0.004), male gender (p=0.009), age (p=0.04), use of antihypertensive drugs (p=0.03) and statins (p=0.05) and, independently of baseline CACS, systolic blood pressure (p=0.0006), waist circumference (p=0.001) and urine albumin:creatine ratio (p=0.04). Most subjects with Type 2 diabetes showed progression of CACS. The absence of a relationship between progression and lipid risk factors and the positive relationship with statin and antihypertensive drug use may reflect earlier risk factor exposure. Independent relationships between progression and established calcification, blood pressure, central adiposity and urine albumin:creatinine ratio suggest areas for risk factor modification that could be especially relevant in Type 2 diabetes.",

Rho proteins cycle between an active, GTP-bound, and an inactive, GDP-bound form, and Rho prenylation is important for Rho's interaction with upstream regulators and downstream effectors, but the effects of statins on Rho signaling are incompletely understood. We found that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin markedly induced the expression of RhoA, B, and C in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. The drug increased RhoA and C only in their unprenylated forms, but it increased both prenylated and unprenylated RhoB and did not significantly affect N- and K-Ras prenylation, suggesting that it inhibited geranyl-geranylation more efficiently than farnesylation. Quantitative analysis of nucleotides bound to Rho demonstrated a 3.7-fold increase in Rho-GTP and a similar increase in Rho-GDP in lovastatin-treated cells, leaving the fraction of Rho in the active, GTP-bound form constant at 5.8%. Lovastatin reduced Rho association with Rho guanine dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI)-alpha and -beta, and prenylation-deficient Rho mutants did not associate with RhoGDI. siRNA inhibition of RhoGDIalpha expression increased Rho-GTP, suggesting that decreased Rho/RhoGDIalpha association explained an increase in unprenylated Rho-GTP in lovastatin-treated cells. Unprenylated Rho A, B, and C were partly functional in activating serum response element-dependent transcription. In conclusion, we quantified effects of lovastatin on RhoA, B, and C isoforms, and provide a molecular mechanism whereby statins cause accumulation of unprenylated Rho-GTP.",

    "150": "We investigated the effects of statins on CRC cell lines using immunoblotting, measurements of apoptosis and cell proliferation, and luciferase reporter assays. The effect of statins was confirmed in a xenograft mouse model.", 
    "151": "CRC cell lines show widely differing sensitivities to statin treatment. Sensitive cell lines show induction of BMP2 protein levels and a BMP2 reporter construct, activation of the BMP pathway, and induction of the BMP target gene ID-2, whereas resistant cell lines do not. The addition of the specific inhibitor of BMPs, noggin, completely prevents lovastatin-induced apoptosis in sensitive cells. Sensitive cell lines express the central BMP pathway element SMAD4, whereas the resistant cell lines do not. Targeted knockout of SMAD4 leads to the loss of statin sensitivity and reconstitution with SMAD4, to the restoration of statin sensitivity. In a xenograft mouse model, tumors from sensitive and insensitive cell lines were treated with oral simvastatin. Significant inhibition of tumor growth using sensitive cells but increased tumor growth when using insensitive cells was observed.", 
    "152": "Statins induce apoptosis in CRC cells through induction of BMP2. Statin therapy may only be effective in SMAD4-expressing CRCs and may have adverse effects in SMAD4-negative tumors.",

    "154": "Transversal, multi-centre study, conducted between March and November, 2004.", 
    "155": "Three-hundred seventy six primary care and specialist doctors from all over the country.", 
    "156": "A total of 2347 patients, with an average age of 59 (12) and 48% women, being treated with statins.", 
    "157": "Survey to evaluate understanding of lipid-lowering diet and pharmacological treatment. The percentage of patients achieving therapy objectives in line with ATP III guidelines was determined.", 
    "158": "Understanding of diet was adequate only for foods with negative effects on the concentration of cholesterol. Overall, understanding was better in the young, those with a higher level of education, those with hyperlipaemia originating in the family, those under treatment for longer, and in those attended in primary care or internal medicine clinics; it was worse in diabetic patients and in those with cardiovascular disease. Patients with more understanding of their treatment reached their therapy objectives to a greater extent.", 
    "159": "Patients receiving statins treatment have an adequate understanding of diet, but little information on pharmacological treatment. This understanding is associated with the achievement of therapy objectives.", 
    "160": "To explore the effect of fluvastatin on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in rats with osteoporosis in the process of fracture healing.", 
    "161": "Fractures at the intermediate piece of the femur were made on 72 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (weighing initially 290-340 g and aged 6 months) with osteoporosis after ovariectomy for three months, then these rats were divided randomly into the medication administration group (the experimental group) and the control group, 36 rats each. In the experimental group, the rats received fluvastatin lavage (10 mg/kg per day) since the next day of operation lasting for 6 weeks, and the rats in the control group received placebo. Then the expression of VEGF and VEGF mRNA in bony callus of the two groups was measured respectively with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization on days of 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, and 42nd, and image analysis was made with real-color image analysis machine.", 
    "162": "No difference was found in the cellular localization of VEGF and VEGF mRNA gene expression between the experimental group and the control group in process of fracture healing and their expression modes were almost similar. On the 14th day postoperatively, the positive extent of positive cells in the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05).", 
    "163": "Fluvastatin can promote the VEGF level in rats with osteoporosis in process of fracture healing.", 
    "164": "It is possible that SMP-797 will be administered frequently in combination with statins to hyperlipidemic patients. OATP1B1 is thought to be the major transporter that mediates the hepatic uptake of statins. This study investigated whether SMP-797 interacts with statins via OATP1B1 by two approaches. Firstly, the effects of SMP-797 on OATP1B1-mediated uptake of estrone-3-sulfate (ES) by human hepatocytes and by oocytes expressing OATP1B1 were examined. Since OATP1B1-mediated uptake of ES is known to be biphasic (high- and low-affinity sites), concentrations of [(3)H]ES were set lower than the respective K(m) values. Two representative statins were used to assure that statins share OATP1B1 with [(3)H]ES in this in vitro system. Rosuvastatin inhibited OATP1B1-mediated uptake of [(3)H]ES through both sites and pravastatin inhibited a high-affinity site. The inhibition by the positive control (cyclosporin A) was significant. Thus, it is considered that this system was applicable to examine drug-drug interaction with statins on OATP1B1-mediated uptake. In this condition, no apparent inhibition to each site by SMP-797 was observed up to a concentration 3,000-fold higher than the clinical level. Secondly, the uptake of [(14)C]SMP-797 by oocytes expressing OATP1B1 was examined and the activity was negligible. In conclusion, these data suggest that SMP-797 has little potential to interact with statins on OATP1B1.", 
    "165": "Simvastatin and omeprazole were re-classified to pharmacy status in Great Britain in summer 2004. The purpose of this study was to compare the views of community pharmacists on over-the-counter (OTC) omeprazole and simvastatin.", 
    "166": "A pre-piloted questionnaire mailed to 2000 randomly selected community pharmacy premises, with open questions relating to pharmacists' views. Pharmacists' attitudes on aspects of supply were sought using Likert scales. Content analysis was performed on responses to the open question and Wilcoxon signed ranks test (z) used to compare responses to the attitudinal statements.", 
    "167": "One thousand one hundred and fifty-six questionnaires were returned (57.8%). Themes around omeprazole illustrated positive views compared to concerns relating to simvastatin. Whereas omeprazole was seen as a welcome addition, there were issues around the poor evidence base for simvastatin. Further simvastatin related concerns were in areas of cardiovascular risk assessment, adverse drug reactions and likelihood of patients not committing to therapy. For both agents, excessive cost was an issue. Nearly three-quarters of pharmacists agreed they were entirely confident about selling omeprazole (835, 73%), significantly more than simvastatin (691, 60%); (z = 9.243, p < 0.001).", 
    "168": "Two re-classified medicines have raised common and product-specific themes. Many themes relate to clinical governance such as evidence-based practice, risk management and continuing professional development (CPD). Views on the availability and circumstances surrounding the OTC supply differ in certain regards, for example, more believe that they should be involved in the sale of simvastatin personally than for sales of omeprazole.", 
    "169": "Current evidence supports the preventive role of statins on platelet aggregation in patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "170": "Our aim was to determine the effects of aggressive statin therapy on platelet function in patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "171": "A total of 178 consecutive patients (37-68 years old, 35.9% women) with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) was enrolled in the study. Platelet function assays were realized by the Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA)-100 with collagen and epinephrine (Col/Epi) and collagen and ADP (Col/ADP) cartridges. Aspirin resistance was defined as having a closure time (CT) of <186 s with Col/Epi cartridges despite regular aspirin therapy. A statin therapy protocol applied to the patients with aspirin resistance for 3 months.", 
    "172": "We determined that 20 (11.2%) of patients had aspirin resistance by the PFA-100. Mean closure time measured with the Col/ADP cartridges was 83 +/- 18 s (53-162 s). Of the patients 12 were not on a statin therapy and eight were taking 10 mg daily atorvastatin. After 3 months of 40 mg daily atorvastatin therapy 13 subjects with aspirin resistance became aspirin sensitive by PFA-100 (P < 0.0001). There was also a significant decrease in total and LDL cholesterol levels and an increase in HDL cholesterol at the third month of statin therapy (P < 0.0001 for all).", 
    "173": "Statin therapy reduced the in vitro aspirin resistance in 65% of the patients after a therapy of 3 months. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of statins' effects on platelet reactivity.", 
    "174": "Women who have delivered a preterm infant are at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but mechanisms for this association are not understood.", 
    "175": "In a cross-sectional study we investigated whether older women with a history of preterm birth (<37 weeks) had a higher prevalence of CVD. Participants were 446 women (mean age 80 years; 47% black) enrolled in the Pittsburgh, PA field center of The Health, Aging and Body Composition Study. Women reported preterm status, birth weight, smoking status, and selected complications for each pregnancy. CVD status was determined by self-report and hospital records. Analysis was limited to first births not explicitly complicated by hypertension or preeclampsia.", 
    "176": "Women who had delivered a preterm infant (on average 57 years in the past) had a higher prevalence of CVD. After adjustment for race, age, blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, interleukin-6, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and statin use, the odds ratio for CVD among women who delivered a preterm infant was 2.85 (95% confidence interval = 1.19-6.85) compared with women who had delivered term infants weighing more than 2500 g. This relationship was not altered by lifetime smoking history. There was evidence of negative confounding by statin use and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Among women delivering infants who were both preterm and low birth weight (<2500 g), the odds ratio was 3.31 (1.06-10.37) for CVD compared with women with term, normal weight infants.", 
    "177": "These results suggest that vascular and metabolic factors account for some but not all of the increased prevalence of CVD among women many years after a preterm birth.", 
    "178": "As part of our search for anti-arteriosclerosis agents from traditional Chinese medicines, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (HCR)-inhibitory constituent, kakkalide, was isolated from the flower of Pueraria thunbergiana (PT, family Leguminosae). The antihyperlipidemic effects of kakkalide and its metabolite, irisolidone, which may be a bioactive form in vivo and potently inhibit the HCR activity, were investigated in vivo. Both the oral and interperitoneal administrations of kakkalide and irisolidone, with the exception of intraperitoneally treated kakkalide, potently lowered the serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) in Trition WR1339-induced hyperlipidemic mice. The oral administrations of kakkalide and irisolidone in hyperlipidemic mice induced, by the long-term feeding of a high fat diet, also potently reduced the serum levels of TC and TG and epididymal fat pad weight. These findings suggest that PT can improve hyperlipidemia, and the hypolipidemic effect may be due to HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "179": "Statins have been shown to increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression via enhanced mRNA stability. Because the poly(A) tail is an important determinant of transcript stability, we sought to characterize the effect of statins on eNOS mRNA 3' polyadenylation.", 
    "180": "Endothelial cells treated with statins had a time- and dose-dependent increase in eNOS transcripts with long poly(A) tails (75 to 160 adenosines). This effect was dependent on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenxyme A (CoA) reductase inhibition and was observed with both lipophilic (simvastatin) and hydrophilic (rosuvastatin) statins. In mRNA stability assays, polyadenylated eNOS transcripts from statin-treated cells were 2- to 3-fold more stable than transcripts from untreated cells. The effect of statins on eNOS polyadenylation was related to cytoskeleton organization; there was increased eNOS mRNA polyadenylation after Rho inhibition and cytochalasin D treatment. Further, we found increased phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II in statin-treated cells, suggesting that statin-induced polyadenylation involved modulation of RNA polymerase II activity.", 
    "181": "Our data provide insight into a mechanism by which statins enhance eNOS mRNA stability and increase eNOS protein: statins increase eNOS mRNA polyadenylation through Rho-mediated changes in the actin cytoskeleton.", 
    "182": "Bisphosphonates cause apoptosis to various types of cancer cells including breast cancer. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway was reported to be involved in the apoptosis induced by bisphosphonates, but its precise mechanism has not been unveiled. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of risedronate, a bisphosphonate, in the apoptosis of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in comparison with that of cerivastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), since statin has been known to induce apoptosis through an isoprenoid-dependent pathway in these cells. We found that i) risedronate induced MCF-7 cells into apoptosis in a manner similar to cerivastatin with the activation of caspase-9 followed by caspase-6 and -7, that ii) bisphosphonate-induced apoptosis was significantly, but not fully, recovered by the addition of GGOH, an isoprenoid, which completely rescued in case of cerivastatin-induced apoptosis, that iii) risedronate induced G2 arrest with the induction of Bim (BH3-only protein), but that statin induced G1 arrest without it, and that iv) the down-regulation of Bim protein by siRNA significantly attenuated the risedronate-induced apoptosis. These data clearly indicate that both isoprenoid-dependent and -independent pathways might be involved in the apoptosis induced by bisphosphonate, and Bim might be a critical component for the isoprenoid-independent apoptotic pathway."
