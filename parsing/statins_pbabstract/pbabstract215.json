Sixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were used. They were divided into ten groups (N = 6 per group). We used ischemia model in these groups. All ischemia groups were rendered ischemic for 3 h. Then followed by reperfusion durations of zero time (0 hR), 3 h (3 hR), 7 days (7 dR), 14 days (14 dR). The treatment group received intravenous simvastatin (1 mg kg(-1)) 1 h before ischemia, while the control group received an equal volume of intravenous vehicle at the same time schedule and route. Behavioral data were obtained immediately before euthanasia. The score was based on coordination, racing reflex, toe spread and reaction to pinch. In simvastatin treated I/R rats we had increase in functional recovery. In conclusion, pre-ischemic administration of simvastatin exhibits neuroprotective properties in I/R nerve injury.", 
    "1": "Liver failure is still a significant clinical problem after transplantation surgery, tissue resections (the Pringle manoeuvre) and haemorrhagic shock. The restoration of blood flow to an ischaemic region leads to tissue injury at a greater rate than the original ischaemic insult, an event termed \"ischaemia-reperfusion injury\" (I/R). Despite advances in surgical techniques, I/R still poses a problem of clinical importance. In this research, we studied the effect of simvastatin pretreatment on liver and lung injury induced by hepatic I/R. Rats were subjected to 30 min of ischaemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Simvastatin (10 mg/kg) was administered orally from three days before the operation. After the reperfusion time, serum ALT, AST, LDH and TNF a levels were studied and liver and lung tissues were stained with haematoxylin and eosin and TUNEL to detect apoptotic cells. Serum aminotransferase activity and LDH and TNFalpha levels were increased markedly by hepatic I/R, and these were suppressed significantly by simvastatin. The tissue injury index and the number of apoptotic cells via TUNEL staining in the liver and lungs were higher in the I/R group than in the I/R + simvastatin group. These results suggest that simvastatin ameliorates I/R-induced liver and lung tissue damage by inhibiting the level of inflammation and the apoptotic pathways. Simvastatin administration may therefore provide protection against the adverse effects of I/R injury in liver transplantation.",

    "3": "To evaluate if blood EPC levels relate to endothelium-dependent vasodilation (ED-VD) in RH.", 
    "4": "We analyzed 29 RH confirmed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and assessed complete clinical and laboratory evaluation. EPCs were isolated from peripheral mononuclear cells (MNC) by flow cytometry. ED-VD was determined measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by venous occlusion plethysmography. Results. Circulating EPCs/10(5) MNC (median [Q1-Q3]): 23.0 [4.5-53.8]. FMD (median [Q1-Q3]): 211.7 [79.5-365.8]%. Significant correlations with log-FMD: EPCs (r = 0.469; p = 0.018) and homocysteine (r = -0.414; p = 0.045). There was no collinearity between EPCs and homocysteine. FMD did not correlate with age, gender, office BP, 24-h systolic blood pressure or 24-h diastolic blood pressure, laboratory parameters, C-reactive-protein, left ventricular-mass index, dyslipidaemia, smoking habit and statin or angiotensin system blockers treatment. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that after age-adjustment, EPC (p = 0.027) and homocysteine (p = 0.004) were the only variables that predicted FMD (R = 0.740). After dividing patients according to EPC number, patients in the lower tertile showed a significantly reduced FMD compared with those in the group of the two upper tertiles of EPC: log-FMD (mean+/-SD): 4.7+/-0.9 vs 5.6+/-0.8, respectively (p = 0.031).", 
    "5": "ED-VD independently correlates with circulating EPCs in RH. Homocysteine is also an independent predictor of lower FMD in such patients.", 
    "6": "Because of the obvious negative relation between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and cardiovascular disease and the substantial residual risk of this disease even during treatment with high-dose statin there has been an urgent need to investigate the possible therapeutic benefit of increasing HDL. Even if treatment with nicotinic acid with its marked HDL-increasing effect has been encouraging, there is no evidence so far that specific increase of HDL cholesterol results in less cardiovascular disease. Treatment with the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor and HDL-increasing drug torcetrapib resulted in increased risk of cardiovascular disease. These negative results were followed by a lively discussion regarding the possible benefit of HDL-increasing treatment in general and CETP inhibition in particular. Suggested possible causes for the negative outcome by torcetrapib treatment are off-target non-CETP-related effect of this particular inhibitor, inability of very high blood HDL cholesterol levels to protect, induction of dysfunctional HDL, and direct atherogenic effect of CETP inhibition. It is concluded that still today little is known about the effect of specific therapeutic elevation of HDL cholesterol, particularly so through CETP inhibition on cardiovascular risk. New interventional studies on this therapeutic principle are welcomed and under way.", 
    "7": "Extracellular acidic pH activated chloride channels (I(Cl,acid)) have been characterized in HEK 293 cells and mammalian cardiac myocytes. This study was designed to evaluate the expression of I(Cl,acid) in RAW264.7 monocytic-macrophage and human peripheral monocytes and to investigate the effect of simvastatin on I(Cl,acid). In two kinds of cells, the activation and deactivation of the current rapidly and repeatedly followed the change of the extracellular solution to pH=4.3. Compared with the outward current (pA/pF) activated at pH 4.3, the currents inhibited by simvastatin at concentrations of 0.1 microM were all decreased a little, however the currents at concentrations of 1 microM and 10 microM simvastatin were decreased significantly. The IC(50) for simvastatin inhibiting I(Cl,acid) of RAW264.7 was 13.77 microM. In summary, we report for the first time that simvastatin inhibits the I(Cl,acid) of RAW264.7 monocytic-macrophage and human peripheral monocytes in a concentration-dependent manner.",

    "9": "The cholesterol concentrations in plasma membranes of erythrocytes were measured by means of Liebermann-Burchard reagent. The membrane lipid peroxidation in whole erythrocytes was determined. The membrane fluidity was estimated by spin labelled method.", 
    "10": "The in vitro study shows that the cholesterol concentration in membranes incubated with simvastatin and epicatechin decreases; in healthy donors there are no changes. Simvastatin does not lead to changes in the lipid peroxidation in the in vitro data. Epicatechin decreases the level of membrane lipid peroxidation in patients with hypercholesterolemia and in healthy donors. Simvastatin and epicatechin cause an increase in the fluidity of plasma membranes of erythrocytes.", 
    "11": "Simvastatin causes the decrease in cholesterol concentration in erythrocytes membranes not only in the in vivo but also the in vitro experiments. Flavonoids have antioxidant properties in vitro. Simvastatin influences the lipid peroxidation only in vivo, not in vitro systems. This observation is an additional contribution to the statins' pleiotropic effect.", 
    "12": "Sclerotic calcification of the aortic valve is a common disease in advanced age. However, pathophysiologic processes leading to valve calcifications are poorly understood. Transformation of atherosclerotic triggers to osteogenic differentiation is controversially discussed and is thought as a trigger of bone transformation in end stage disease. This study focuses on the transcriptional gene-profiling of severe calcified stenotic human aortic valves to clarify the molecular basis of the pathophysiological process. We collected severely calcified and stenotic human aortic valves (CSAV) with (CSAV+, n=10) and without (CSAV-, n=10) at least 4 weeks of statin pre-treatment prior to valve replacement and investigated transcriptional steady-state gene-profiling by using micro array technique and GAPDH-adjusted PCR for confirmation. Results were compared with findings in non-sclerotic aortic valves: C (n=6). Various parameters of inflammation were significantly up regulated as compared to C: eotaxin3, monokine induced by gamma-interferon, vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1), peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-alpha or transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1). Except for TGF beta 1 and VAP-1, statin pre-treatment neutralized altered gene expression. Genes of osteogenic bone transformation (tenascin C, bone sialoprotein, Cbfa1, Osteocalcin, Beta-catenin, Sox- and Cyclin-genes) were found unaltered in their expression in both, CSAV- or CSAV+ in comparison to C. This study shows continuing atherosclerotic inflammation on CSAV. Additionally, no evidence of initiated osteoblastic differentiation process was found. Pre-treatment of patients with statins partially neutralized the gene pattern of inflammation on the aortic valves. This suggests that there are potent benefits of statins on early development of inflammation on calcified aortic valves.", 
    "13": "There are only a few reports on the effect of statins over diseased muscle and none in cytoplasmic body myopathy. This is a heterogeneous entity that can be asymptomatic until late in life and is characterized by the presence of numerous cytoplasmic bodies in muscle biopsy. A 74-years-old male received statin treatment on two separate occasions, first with sinvastatin and afterwards with rosuvastatin. In both cases, he experienced diffuse myalgia, lower limbs weakness and respiratory fatigue and improved after interruption of each treatment course. Electromyography has shown signs of muscle necrosis, serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration was increased and muscle biopsy revealed numerous cytoplasmic bodies. To our knowledge this is the first report of statin-related muscle necrosis in a patient with CBM. According to the literature neuropathological features of statin myopathy do not include the presence of cytoplasmic bodies so we assume that cytoplasmic body myopathy was asymptomatically present before statin treatment. This case supports the role of muscle biopsy in patients that develop muscular necrosis while on statin treatment.", 
    "14": "Among the many factors likely to favour the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), exposure to certain drugs has to be taken into account. Although hormone treatments, oral contraception and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause have been studied, these are not the only drugs associated with an increased risk of VTE. The antipsychotics have also been incriminated in the occurrence of venous thromboembolism. The association of thalidomide and dexamethasone, used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, is responsible for a major increase in the risk of VTE. The physiopathological mechanisms accounting for the possible prothrombotic effect of most of these drugs is still not fully understood. Further observational and interventional clinical studies should provide a better understanding of VTE, potentially associated with drugs. However, certain drugs may be associated with a reduced risk of VTE. Although several studies indicate that aspirin and statins may favourably influence the risk of VTE, it is still not possible to draw up any practical recommendations.",

Inflammatory biomarkers, including highsensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and endothelin (ET-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), adiponectin, and lipid profiles were measured before and after statin therapy.", 
    "17": "Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin both lowered levels of hs-CRP, MMP-9, PAI-1, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline values, with rosuvastatin lowering TC and LDL-C to a greater extent than atorvastatin (P < 0.05). Adiponectin level increase was 15% higher than that at baseline with atorvastatin (P > 0.05) but 67% higher with rosuvastatin (P < 0.05).", 
    "18": "Therapy with both statins not only significantly improved lipid profiles but also decreased levels of vascular biomarkers hs-CRP, MMP-9, and PAI-1; however, only rosuvastatin increased serum adiponectin levels significantly in patients with hypercholesterolemia, which could imply a beneficial effect in coronary artery disease.",

    "21": "Ramipril, used alone, was capable of significantly increasing the antioxidative defenses of the diabetic rat; simvastatin, given alone or combined with ramipril in separate administrations, did not produce any significant effect on the oxidative stress; concomitant administration of ramipril and simvastatin significantly reduced the antioxidative plasmatic defenses of rats with chemically induced diabetes mellitus", 
    "22": "Our data corroborate the positive effect of ramipril upon plasma antioxidative defenses but did not confirm a possible beneficial effect of simvastatin in the model. More research is needed to clarify the paradoxal TRAP reduction verified with simultaneous administration of the drugs.", 
    "23": "Atorvastatin (ATV), the best known HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor family member, undergoes pH-dependent hydroxy acid-lactone interconversion similar to other statins. Although the only active form is a linear one, it was shown that drug interactions should also be considered for the lactone. The ATV lactonisation-hydrolysis mechanism was investigated theoretically using the density functional theory (DFT) method. Under both mildly acidic and basic conditions, the ATV lactone form is less stable than its hydroxy acid form. However, in the presence of a carboxylic acid, the equilibrium was only slightly shifted towards the lactone side (4 kcal mol(-1) difference between the substrate and the product), while energy gain for the hydrolysis under basic conditions amounts to 18 kcal mol(-1). Hydrolysis activation energy barriers were 19 and 6 kcal mol(-1), in acidic and basic conditions, respectively. We determined one-step interconversion as unfavourable under physiological conditions due to a 35 kcal mol(-1) activation energy barrier. All data were compared with analogue ones for fluvastatin (FLV) reported earlier and indicated that ATV is more flexible than FLV, not only due to the fact that it has more rotatable carbon-carbon single bonds, but also because ATV lactonistation-hydrolysis energy barriers are lower.", 
    "24": "The main objective of this study was to determine whether elevated blood beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels among the first-degree relatives of patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are associated with vascular risk factors of AD. Serum Abeta was measured in samples from 197 cognitively normal first-degree relatives of patients with AD-like dementia. Study participants were recruited as part of an ancillary study of the Alzheimer's Disease Anti-inflammatory Prevention Trial (ADAPT subpopulation). The ADAPT subpopulation was found to be similar in age, sex, and ethnicity to another cognitively normal cohort (n = 98). Using cross-sectional analyses, we examined the association of Abeta with blood pressure, lipid levels, apolipoprotein E genotypes, and the use of prescribed medication to treat vascular risk factors in the ADAPT subpopulation. Abeta(1-40) was positively associated with age, use of antihypertensives, and serum creatinine, and we observed a marginal negative interaction on Abeta(1-40) associated with systolic blood pressure and use of antihypertensives. Serum Abeta(1-42) was associated with statin use and a positive correlation of Abeta (1-42) with HDL was observed among statin nonusers. These findings suggest that high Abeta in the periphery among the family history-enriched cohorts may be due to enrichment of vascular risk factors and may reflect presymptomatic AD pathology. It remains to be determined whether the association of Abeta with medications used for treating vascular risk factors indicates prevention of AD. Longitudinal evaluation of blood Abeta in this cohort will provide a better understanding of the significance of this association in AD etiology.",

This study compared the effects of combination therapy with ABT-335 (a new formulation of fenofibric acid) and simvastatin to ABT-335 and simvastatin monotherapies on lipid and nonlipid parameters in patients with mixed dyslipidemia.", 
    "26": "This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study. A total of 657 patients with mixed dyslipidemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] > or =130 mg/dL, triglycerides [TGs] > or =150 mg/dL, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]<40 mg/dL [men] or <50 mg/dL [women]) were randomized to 12 weeks of treatment with ABT-335 + simvastatin (20 or 40 mg) combination therapy, ABT-335 monotherapy (135 mg), or simvastatin monotherapy (20, 40, or 80 mg).",

HDL-C increased 17.8% versus 7.2% and TGs decreased -37.4% versus -14.2% (ABT-335 + simvastatin 20 vs simvastatin 20); LDL-C decreased -24.0% versus -4.0% (ABT-335 + simvastatin 20 vs ABT-335). HDL-C increased 18.9% versus 8.5% and TGs decreased -42.7% versus -22.4% (ABT-335 + simvastatin 40 vs simvastatin 40); LDL-C decreased -25.3% versus -4.0% (ABT-335 + simvastatin 40 vs ABT-335). Twelve-week treatment with combination therapy was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with ABT-335 and simvastatin monotherapies. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported.",

    "29": "Although prior studies have demonstrated disparities in the management and outcomes of women with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), there are limited large-scale contemporary data on gender differences in post-intervention outcomes in this population.", 
    "30": "We analyzed patients according to 2 ACS categories, unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who had a percutaneous coronary intervention in the ACC-NCDR from January 1, 2004, to March 30, 2006. Of 199,690 patients, 55,691 women presented with UA/NSTEMI, and 12,335 women presented with STEMI. Clinical and angiographic characteristics, procedural and treatment patterns, and in-hospital outcomes were examined.", 
    "31": "Women presented more often with UA/NSTEMI than men (82% of women vs 77% of men, P < .0001). Despite having greater comorbidities, women in both ACS categories had fewer high risk angiographic features than men. Women were less likely to receive aspirin or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and were less often discharged on aspirin or statin. For in-hospital mortality, the adjusted odds ratio for men compared to women was similar (odds ratio 0.97, P = .5). Women had higher rates of cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, any bleeding, and any vascular complications. Importantly, rates of subacute stent thrombosis were less in women compared to men (0.43% vs 0.57%, P = .0003).", 
    "32": "Although women had fewer high-risk angiographic features than men, they continue to have higher rates of in-hospital complications. This suggests the need for gender-tailored techniques to minimize post-intervention complications and maximize application of evidence-based antiplatelet therapies.", 
    "33": "Despite improvements in the identification of causes of peripheral neuropathy, idiopathic polyneuropathy remains common. Medication and toxic neuropathy account for a small but important percentage of potentially preventable or reversible causes of neuropathy. New drugs that can induce neuropathy have been approved over the past several years, including the anticancer agents bortezomib, ixabepilone, and oxaliplatin. We review the neurotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers infliximab and etanercept, the inflammatory arthritis agent leflunomide, and the antibiotic linezolid. The controversy of statin-induced neuropathy continues to unfold; the large Fremantle Diabetes Study has suggested that statins may have neuroprotective effects. Dichloroacetate is a promising agent for lactic acidosis-associated disorders, but toxic neuropathy is a treatment-limiting factor. We also describe a progressive inflammatory neuropathy in swine slaughterhouse workers that appears to be a toxin-induced immune response.", 
    "34": "Recently reported clinical trials raise doubts on the effectiveness of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapies in reducing the residual risk of cardiovascular events after statin monotherapy. Addition of -torcetrapib to statin therapy increased overall mortality in coronary patients despite a marked increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Combining ezetimibe with statin therapy neither further reduces carotid atherosclerosis nor slows aortic stenosis, and it has not been shown to be superior to statin monotherapy in reducing cardiovascular events. Clinical trials currently in progress will more clearly delineate the cardiovascular effects of adding either ezetimibe or extended-release niacin/laropiprant to statin therapy.", 
    "35": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutary coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiac events in different high-risk and medium-risk patient groups. Although there are other medications to lower cholesterol, evidence that these agents will provide protection from initial cardiac events is limited or does not exist. Also, although many physicians advocate combining second agents with statins to improve certain lipid fractions, evidence of improved reduction of initial cardiac events from these combinations is also lacking. Therefore, aggressive use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors remains the proven treatment to treat lipid abnormalities in primary patients.", 
    "36": "Statins have proven benefit in preventing cardiovascular events and should be prescribed for almost all patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or equivalent. However, evidence is lacking to support treating all such individuals. Potential exceptions include those in the initial days of acute coronary syndrome, those with symptomatic systolic heart failure, those with very low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetic patients without associated metabolic syndrome, and those with high CHD risk calculated mainly on the basis of advanced age. In these cases, the decision to prescribe statins depends on clinical judgment, and surrogate tests for CHD may be useful.", 
    "37": "Statins reduce plasma plant sterol concentrations and, less consistently, their ratios to cholesterol in short-term studies. They most likely accomplish this by decreasing their transport protein levels. In long-term treatment with large doses of effective statins, serum plant sterol concentrations and frequently their ratios to cholesterol are consistently increased, especially with high, as opposed to low, baseline ratios. Enhanced intestinal absorption, decreased biliary secretion, and reversed cholesterol and plant sterol transport could explain these findings. However, statin treatment increases plant sterol ratios in serum and also in arterial plaques of endarterectomized patients. No trials of functional foods with plant sterols or stanols are available for coronary heart disease, even though their combination with statins effectively reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Plant sterols increase and plant stanols decrease serum plant sterols. Long-term statin treatment lowers coronary heart disease events only in patients with low baseline plant sterols who have high cholesterol synthesis. No convincing evidence is available that statin-induced phytosterolemia worsens atherosclerosis.", 
    "38": "Statins are a necessary component of a polypill. Almost all patients have the potential to benefit from low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statins, although absolute benefits due to the reduction in coronary heart disease and stroke vary by risk level. The reduction in coronary heart disease and stroke from antihypertensive therapy is additive to the reduction in risk from statins. Used in combination with antihypertensive therapy, a moderate-dose statin would be expected to reduce cardiovascular risk by at least 50%, and a high-dose statin would be expected to reduce risk by at least 60% over an approximately 5-year period. A polypill containing aspirin in addition to a statin and antihypertensive therapy would be appropriate for most men over age 55 years, but not for high-risk women until age 65 years and moderately high-risk women until age 75 years. Polypills in development hold great promise for reducing the global burden of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "39": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are safe and effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. As a result, they confer an all-cause mortality benefit across a wide range of patient groups. The utility of statins is limited by their adverse effects, including myalgias and rhabdomyolysis. These clinical events, plus other symptoms, constitute what is termed statin myopathy. This review summarizes current concepts of statin myopathy and presents strategies to minimize statin-associated myopathic complaints.",

    "46": "Simvastatin attenuated the histopathological change of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and prevented the increase of lung hydroxyproline content and collagen (I and III) mRNA expression induced by bleomycin. Moreover, simvastatin down-regulated the increased expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) induced by bleomycin at both gene and protein levels. Simultaneously, the accumulation of neutrophils and lymphocytes and the increased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid were inhibited by simvastatin in early inflammatory phase after bleomycin infusion. The higher dose of simvastatin was associated with a more significant reduction in these inflammatory and fibrotic parameters. Furthermore, the inactivation of p38, RhoA and Smad2/3 signaling pathways was observed during simvastatin administration.", 
    "47": "Simvastatin attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as indicated by decreases in Ashcroft score and lung collagen accumulation.

Fifty-six days after being ovariectomized (OVX), screw-shaped titanium implants were inserted into the tibiae. Simvastatin was administered orally at 5 mg/kg each day after the placement of the implant in the OVX+SIM group. The animals were sacrificed at either 28 or 84 days after implantation and the undecalcified tissue sections were obtained. Bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone area (BA) within the limits of implant threads were measured around the cortical (zone A) and cancellous (zone B) bone regions.

The mean age of participants was 67 (SD 10) years (72% male). Many participants (72%) were at risk of a cardiovascular event based on a prior history and 18% had type II diabetes.", 
    "56": "Participants had been prescribed lipid-lowering therapy (94% statin therapy) for an average of 10 years and visited their general practitioner on average three times per year. For those who knew their most recent cholesterol reading (67%), the total cholesterol was on average 4.5 (SD 1.1) mmol/l. This level was above the recommended limits for 40% of participants. Overall, 85% of participants reported knowing that there was high- and low-density lipoprotein forms of cholesterol, but only 56% and 38%, respectively, said that they understood or showed signs of clearly understanding the different types of cholesterol when their knowledge was assessed further. On the whole, therefore, participants had a limited understanding about cholesterol and its potential impact on cardiovascular events. Moreover, 25% of participants admitted to being non-compliant in taking their medication and only 51% correctly identified modifiable risk factors as most important for heart disease. Encouragingly, despite 85% of participants finding lifestyle changes challenging, most still identified their potential benefits.",

Strategies to address 'cholesterol complacency', in the sense of a willingness to accept sub-optimal standards of cholesterol control at both the patient and healthcare system levels (general practitioners in particular), are urgently needed to truncate an anticipated rising tide of cardiovascular disease in Australia.",

As such, we evaluated whether concomitant administration of simvastatin would minimize cyclosporine A-associated alveolar bone loss in rats subjected, or not, to experimental periodontal disease.", 
    "60": "Groups of 10 rats each were treated with cyclosporine A (10 mg/kg/day), simvastatin (20 mg/kg/day), cyclosporine A and simvastatin concurrently (cyclosporine A/simvastatin) or vehicle for 30 days. Four other groups of 10 rats each received a cotton ligature around the lower first molar and were treated similarly with cyclosporine A, simvastatin, cyclosporine A/simvastatin or vehicle. Calcium (Ca(2+)), phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels were evaluated in serum. Expression levels of interleukin-1beta, prostaglandin E(2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase were evaluated in the gingivomucosal tissues. Bone volume and numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts were also analyzed.", 
    "61": "Treatment with cyclosporine A in rats, with or without ligature, was associated with bone loss, represented by a lower bone volume and an increase in the number of osteoclasts. Treatment with cyclosporine A was associated with bone resorption, whereas simvastatin treatment improved cyclosporine A-associated alveolar bone loss in all parameters studied. In addition, simvastatin, in the presence of inflammation, can act as an anti-inflammatory agent.", 
    "62": "This study shows that simvastatin therapy leads to a reversal of the cyclosporine A-induced bone loss, which may be mediated by downregulation of interleukin-1beta and prostaglandin E(2) production.",

PCSK9 is synthesized as a zymogen and its prodomain is cleaved by its own catalytic activity. The cleaved prodomain forms a protein complex with the rest of the PCSK9 carboxyl terminus within the endoplasmic reticulum and is secreted. Secreted PCSK9 has been shown to be able to reduce low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) levels in vitro and in vivo. Thus PCSK9 has emerged as an important player modulating LDLR levels and plasma LDL cholesterol. Furthermore, PCSK9 deficiency leads to significantly lowered LDL cholesterol levels in humans and provides dramatic protection against coronary heart disease. We review here the current understanding of PCSK9 and its potential as a therapeutic target through which to reduce LDL cholesterol for prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease.", 
    "66": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are at a significantly higher risk from coronary heart diseases (CHD) and myocardial infarction (MI) compared to gender- and age-matched non-infected individuals. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has transformed a fatal illness into a chronic stable condition. However, cART induces metabolic abnormalities in HIV-infected patients, while its role in vascular atherosclerosis is still under investigation. The use of cART is linked to inflammation - a key mechanism in atherosclerotic progression and destabilisation that precedes clinical events like MI. There is evidence of visceral fat abnormal distribution in HIV infected patients, and inflammatory changes in HIV infected patients drive the initiation, progression and, ultimately, thrombotic clinical complications induced by atherosclerosis. Visceral adipose tissue, a virtual factory for manufacturing pro-inflammatory mediators, affects the liver function. The inflamed liver promotes the development of pro-atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Pro-inflammatory cytokines released by adipocytes travel to the skeletal muscles and other peripheral tissues, worsening insulin sensitivity and leading to hyperglycaemia. Increased high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) inflammatory marker is associated with endothelial dysfunction in HIV-infected patients. Increased levels of monocytic nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappa-B), a master switch in the inflammatory cascade, are documented in patients with elevated hs-CRP levels. It can be assumed that, as a result of NFkappa-B activation, hs-CRP up-regulates cytokines that contribute to MI by recruiting leukocytes and promoting thrombosis. This review focuses on the association of HIV-infection, metabolic abnormalities and known mechanisms involved in inducing accelerated atherosclerosis and inflammation in HIV-infected patients, as well as the role of lipid lowering agents in potentially preventing CHD.", 
    "67": "A 61-year-old woman with hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and diabetes mellitus was referred to hospital for the evaluation of chest pain at rest. Eccentric 50% stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery was detected by 64-slice multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT). The plaque morphology was considered as soft by Color Code Plaque (CCP) analysis. Seven days after MDCT, chest pain continued and transient ST-elevation was detected on the II-lead ECG monitor during echocardiography. Therefore, emergency coronary angiography was performed and confirmed the 50% stenosis as shown on MDCT. Her disease was diagnosed as vasospastic angina. For the purpose of plaque stabilization, lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin was instituted and her symptoms improved. After 11 months, serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were reduced. A second MDCT was performed and plaque morphology had changed from soft to intermediate. Cross-sectional multiplanar reconstruction of MDCT images indicated reduction of total vessel area, expansion of the lumen area and improvement of the remodeling index at the site of stenosis. The lipid-lowering therapy contributed to plaque stabilization, and CCP analysis by noninvasive MDCT was useful for plaque characterization. This case suggests that differences between vulnerable and stable plaques can be classified using MDCT to predict acute coronary syndrome.",

    "69": "The subjects were 178 Japanese with hypercholesterolemia, including 103 (58%) with type 2 diabetes. Pitavastatin (12 mg/day) was administered for 12 months. Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C), triglycerides (TG) and hs-CRP levels were measured for 12 months.", 
    "70": "Serum LDL-C and RLP-C levels were significantly decreased by 30.3% and 22.8%, respectively. Serum TG levels were decreased by 15.9% in subjects with basal TG levels above 150 mg/dl. Serum HDL-C levels were significantly increased. The administration of pitavastatin reduced serum hs-CRP levels by 34.8%. No serious adverse events were observed, including changes in glycosylated hemoglobin levels of diabetic patients.",

Increased ROCK activity has been implicated in endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. We hypothesize that ezetimibe, which inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption, may not exert similar cholesterol-independent or pleiotropic effects of statins and, when used with a lower dose of statin, have less effect on ROCK activity than a higher dose of statin.", 
    "73": "In a prospective, randomized, observer-blinded study, we treated 60 dyslipidemic subjects without cardiovascular disease with simvastatin 40 mg/d, simvastatin/ezetimibe 10/10 mg/d, or placebo tablets for 28 days (n=20 in each arm). We evaluated baseline demographics and lipid levels, ROCK activity, C-reactive protein, and flow-mediated dilation before and after treatment. Compared with the placebo group, both treatment regimens decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 38% and C-reactive protein by 38% to 40% after 28 days (P<0.01 for both compared with placebo). Although the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein reductions were comparable with either lipid-lowering regimen, only simvastatin 40 mg reduced ROCK activity and improved flow-mediated dilation (P<0.01 for both compared with baseline). Reduction in ROCK activity with simvastatin 40 mg remained significant even after controlling for changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.01) and correlated with improvement in flow-mediated dilation (R(2)=-0.78, P<0.01). No correlation was found between changes in flow-mediated dilation and changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or C-reactive protein.", 
    "74": "These results indicate that high-dose statin monotherapy exerts greater effects on ROCK activity and endothelial function, but not on C-reactive protein, than low-dose statin plus ezetimibe. These findings provide additional evidence of statin benefits beyond cholesterol lowering.", 
    "75": "Previous reports have indicated that in vitro biliary clearance (Cl(biliary)) determined in sandwich-cultured hepatocytes correlates well with in vivo Cl(biliary) for limited sets of compounds. The purpose of this study was 1) to determine the in vitro Cl(biliary) in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes of angiotensin II receptor blockers and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that undergo limited metabolism and 2) to compare the predicted Cl(biliary) values with estimated in vivo hepatic clearance data in humans. The average biliary excretion index and in vitro intrinsic Cl(biliary) values of olmesartan, valsartan, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes were 35, 23, 31, 25, and 16%, respectively, and 0.943, 1.20, 0.484, 3.39, and 5.48 ml/min/kg, respectively. Cl(biliary) values predicted from sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes correlated with estimated in vivo hepatic clearance values based on published data (no in vivo data in humans was available for pitavastatin), and the rank order was also consistent. In conclusion, in vitro Cl(biliary) determined in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes can be used to predict in vivo Cl(biliary) of compounds in humans.",

Patients with increases in both markers were at the greatest risk of HF, compared with patients without an increased marker concentration (HR(adj), 8.3; P = 0.01). The benefit of intensive statin therapy in reducing HF was consistent among all patients, regardless of hsCRP or BNP concentration.",

Recent studies also demonstrated anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of statins by modulating the activity of small GTPases. Statins are thus considered as potential therapeutic drug for the inflammatory demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). However, little is known about the effects of statins on myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. Here, we show that statins hamper process and myelin formation in vitro by interfering with Ras and Rho signaling in mature oligodendrocytes and provide evidence that statins impair ongoing remyelination in vivo. Our findings may have significant implications for the application of statins in MS patients and in other demyelinating diseases of the CNS.",

Adult female Wistar rats (n=72 and 8, per group) were injured with controlled cortical impact and treated either with monotherapy of MSCs or simvastatin or a combination therapy of these two agents. Different combination doses were tested, and nine groups of animals were studied. Neurological function was evaluated using Modified Neurological Severity Score (MNSS), and animals were sacrificed 3 months after injury. Coronal brain sections were stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that, though functional improvement was seen with monotherapies of MSCs and simvastatin, the combination therapy when used in optimal doses was significantly better in improving functional outcome. This improvement was long lasting and persisted until the end of the trial (3 months). The optimum combination dose was 0.5mg of simvastatin combined with 2 x 10(6) MSCs. Post mortem analysis showed the presence of donor MSCs within the injured cortex. Endogenous cellular proliferation induced by the neurorestorative treatments was also observed in the lesion boundary zone. Our data show that MSCs and simvastatin have a synergistic effect in improving functional outcome after TBI.",

Mipomersen sodium is currently being studied in phase II/III clinical studies to determine its clinical utility as add-on therapy to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or other lipid-lowering agents in subjects with hypercholesterolaemia. The aim of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic interactions of mipomersen sodium with simvastatin and ezetimibe. Another aim was to evaluate the ability of mipomersen sodium to inhibit major cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes in vitro.", 
    "83": "In a phase I clinical study, ten healthy subjects per cohort received a single oral dose of simvastatin 40 mg or ezetimibe 10 mg followed by four 2-hour intravenous doses of mipomersen sodium 200 mg over an 8-day period, with simvastatin 40 mg or ezetimibe 10 mg being administered again with the last dose of mipomersen sodium. Mipomersen sodium pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed following the first dose (mipomersen sodium alone) and the last dose (mipomersen sodium in combination with simvastatin or ezetimibe). Plasma samples for measurement of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, and free and total ezetimibe concentrations were collected at various timepoints following their first and last oral dosing. A comparative pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to determine if there were any effects resulting from coadministration of mipomersen sodium with these lipid-lowering drugs. In addition to the clinical pharmacokinetic analysis, the ability of mipomersen sodium to inhibit the major CYP isoform enzymes (namely CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) was evaluated in cryo-preserved human hepatocytes in vitro.", 
    "84": "The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from 0 to 24 hours (AUC(24)), maximum plasma concentration and apparent elimination half-life values of mipomersen sodium were similar when administered alone and in combination with oral simvastatin or oral ezetimibe. The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric least squares means ratios (%Reference) of the mipomersen sodium AUC(24) values were 93.6, 107 when administered together with simvastatin, and 92.4, 111 when administered with ezetimibe. Therefore, there were no large deviations outside the default no-effect boundaries (80-125%) for total exposure (the AUC) of mipomersen sodium in combination with either simvastatin or ezetimibe. Similarly, large deviations outside the default no-effect boundaries were not observed for simvastatin, simvastatin acid, or free and total ezetimibe exposure in combination with mipomersen sodium. In cryo-preserved human hepatocytes, mipomersen sodium exhibited no cytotoxicity. Significant cell uptake was demonstrated by analysing cell-associated concentrations of mipomersen sodium. All evaluated enzyme activities had <10% inhibition at tested concentrations up to 800 microg/mL (approximately 100 micromol/L) of mipomersen sodium, and dose-dependent inhibition was not observed. Therefore, mipomersen sodium is not considered an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities.", 
    "85": "These data provide evidence that mipomersen sodium exhibits no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with the disposition and clearance of simvastatin or ezetimibe, and vice versa. Moreover, mipomersen sodium does not inhibit any of the major CYP enzymes that were evaluated. Taken together, the results from this study support the use of mipomersen sodium in combination with oral lipid-lowering agents.",

On US normal fibrillar echostructure (grade 1) of the Achilles tendon (AT) was observed in 42 patients, abnormal echostructure with diffuse heterogeneous echo pattern (grade 2) in 30 patients and focal hypoechoic lesions (grade 3) in 8 patients. At baseline, ATT of all patients (5.23+/-0.91 mm) was significantly larger compared with controls (4.20+/-0.70 mm) (p<0.05). Patients with grades 2 (5.20+/-0.60 mm) and 3 (6.98+/-1.07 mm) had significantly larger ATT than those with grade 1 (4.90+/-0.55 mm), p<0.05. Patients with grade 1 showed significant reduction in ATT after statin treatment (from 4.90+/-0.55 mm to 4.50+/-0.43 mm, p<0.01). In patients with grades 2 and 3 abnormal echostructure remained unchanged and no significant reduction in ATT was observed.",

    "94": "Despite achieving targets for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, and glycemia in accordance with current standards of care, patients with dyslipidemia remain at high residual risk of vascular events. Atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, often with elevated apolipoprotein B and non-HDL cholesterol, is common in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome and contributes to both macrovascular and microvascular residual risk. However, atherogenic dyslipidemia is largely underdiagnosed and undertreated in clinical practice. The Residual Risk Reduction Initiative (R3i) was established to address this highly relevant clinical issue. The aims of this position paper are (1) to highlight evidence that atherogenic dyslipidemia is associated with residual macrovascular and microvascular risk in patients at high risk for CVD, despite current standards of care for dyslipidemia and diabetes; and (2) to recommend therapeutic intervention for reducing this residual vascular risk supported by evidence and expert consensus. Lifestyle modification with nutrition and exercise is an important, effective, and underutilized first step in reducing residual vascular risk. Therapeutic intervention aimed at achievement of all lipid targets is also often required. Combination lipid-modifying therapy, with the addition of niacin, a fibrate, or omega-3 fatty acids to statin therapy, increases the probability of achieving all lipid goals. Outcomes studies are in progress to evaluate whether these combination treatment strategies translate to a clinical benefit greater than that achieved with statins alone. The R3i highlights the need to address with lifestyle and/or pharmacotherapy the high level of residual risk of CVD events and microvascular complications among patients with dyslipidemia receiving therapy for high levels of LDL cholesterol and for diabetes in accordance with current standards of care.", 
    "95": "It is well-established that serum total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, low HDL-cholesterol and calculated indices such as total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio or less commonly used indices such as non-HDL cholesterol are strongly predictive of cardiovascular events. Serum triglycerides, by contrast, are only modestly associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) in multivariate analysis and incorporation of triglycerides into prediction algorithms is therefore unlikely to improve their prediction capability. Meta-analysis of studies including > 90,000 subjects has provided robust evidence that statins reduce important clinical end-points. These included a 12% fall in all-cause mortality, 19% fall in CHD mortality and 23% fall in CHD mortality or myocardial infarction. Furthermore there are high quality data showing additional benefit of intensive statin therapy over standard statin therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, meta-analysis of 10 fibrate trials has shown inconsistent evidence of vascular benefit and non-cardiovascular mortality has been slightly but consistently elevated in most fibrate trials and in meta-analysis. The general use of fibrates for cardiovascular risk reduction can therefore not be supported at present. Other second line agents such as bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid and omega-3 fatty acid supplements have been evaluated in a few randomized controlled studies in which cardiovascular benefit has been found but clearly further data are required to properly establish their use in clinical practice. Ongoing studies such as ACCORD, IMPROVE-IT, ASCEND, ORIGIN and HPS2-THRIVE should assist in answering outstanding questions over the next 5 years.", 
    "96": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors have been used clinically for lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Interindividual pharmacological differences observed with this treatment have been attributed to genetic differences. The aim of this study was to assess the association in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction by atorvastatin and (TTA)n polymorphism in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase gene in patients with coronary artery disease. Changes in total cholesterol levels, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and free F(2)-isoprostanes were also evaluated. In an open study, patients received 40 mg atorvastatin daily for 8 weeks. Genotyping was done through polymerase chain reaction. The genotype distribution of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (TTA)n polymorphism was: >10/>10 in 22 out of 64 patients (34%), >10/10 in 14 out of 64 patients (22%) and 10/10 in 28 out of 64 patients (44%). The reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by atorvastatin was not different between allelic variants (TTA)n repeat polymorphism. Reductions in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were observed in atorvastatin-treated patients with alleles >10/>10 and 10/10. Free F(2)-isoprostanes and total cholesterol were also significantly lower after treatment for all alleles, irrespective of type of polymorphism. In conclusion, the changes induced by atorvastatin treatment on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and free F(2)-isoprostane concentrations were not related to the presence of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase polymorphism (TTA)n.",

Intervention and control patients had to have purchased at least 1 generic simvastatin and non-simvastatin statin, respectively, after patent expiration. Intervention patients were matched to control patients up to 1:2 on incident statin use (yes/no) and pre-patent expiration copay (+/- $2). Adherence was calculated with the medication possession ratio (MPR). Adjusted and unadjusted changes in MPR were compared between groups. Elasticity of demand for statins was estimated.",

    "102": "We describe some of our studies on use of neuro-restorative agents for treatment of neural injury. We focus on cell-based therapies and select from a variety of statins. In addition, we show that cell-based and pharmacological-based therapies enhance brain plasticity and promote recovery of function after stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Injured brain recapitulates ontogeny. Cerebral tissue around the infarction expresses developmental genes, many of which are present only during embryonic or neonatal stages of development. Brain response to injury undergoes remodeling with induction of angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis. The attempt at remodeling, although expressed as a partial improvement in patients with stroke and ICH, is clearly insufficient to promote substantial recovery in many patients. The goal of restorative therapies should be to activate and amplify this endogenous restorative brain plasticity process to potentiate functional recovery. The logic of restorative therapy is to treat intact or marginally compromised tissue and not injured or dying tissue. Thus, these treatments can be made available for all neurological injury. Once demonstrated to be effective for treatment of a large middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), these restorative treatments can be applied to many types of injury, including ICH, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative disease such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis.",

No differences in any of the morphologic or functional aortic parameters appeared between patients and controls. Age and gender were independent predictors of the majority of the morphologic and functional measures. Carotid intima-media thickness assessed by US was greater in patients (0.57 mm +/- 0.13 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.13 mm, p = 0.005) as was cholesterol-years score (243 +/- 122 vs. 137 +/- 74, p < 0.001). Patients had thicker intima-media of the common carotid artery and higher cholesterol burden as indicated by their cholesterol-years score. Despite this, no differences existed in morphologic or functional aortic parameters assessed with MRI. The improved care of cardiovascular risk factors, especially statin treatment, may protect the aorta of FH patients. However, larger confirmatory studies are needed.", 
    "104": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is among the most common causes of chronic liver disease in the western world. It is now recognized that these patients have myriad of important co-morbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypothyroidism and metabolic syndrome). The workup of patients with suspected NAFLD should consist of excluding competing etiologies and systemic evaluation of metabolic comorbidities. NAFLD is histologically categorized into steatosis and steatohepatitis, two states with fairly dichotomous natural history. While significant progress has been made in terms of noninvasively predicting advanced fibrosis, insufficient progress has been made in predicting steatohepatitis. Currently, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the histological stratification of NAFLD. While sustained weight loss can be effective to treat NASH, it is often difficult to achieve. Foregut bariatric surgery can be quite effective in improving hepatic histology in selected patients without liver failure or significant portal hypertension. Thiazolidinediones have shown promise and the results from the ongoing, large multicenter study should become available soon. Large multicenter studies of CB, receptor anatagonists are also underway but their results will not be available for several years. Several recent studies have highlighted that cardiovascular disease is the single most important cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population.",

    "106": "This Practice Point commentary discusses a retrospective study by Oh et al. in which the consequences of using statins in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) were examined. Out of 170 patients with MG seen at a single hospital center during a 2.5-year period, 54 used statins. Six of these patients reported a worsening of MG symptoms within 8 weeks after receiving statins; in two cases the worsening was associated with a confirmed increase in serum acetylcholine receptor antibody concentration. A further seven patients retrospectively reported temporary muscle aching during the first 8 weeks after statin treatment. This effect was less clearly attributable to the drugs. The effects of statins on MG symptoms were believed to be mediated by the immune system. Statins should be used for the same indications in patients with MG as in those without the condition. However, patients with MG should be informed about the possibility of MG exacerbation, and the statins should be withdrawn if this occurs.", 
    "107": "Recent studies suggest that statin therapy reduces hospitalizations for heart failure (HF). However, few data exist regarding the role of statins in preventing HF after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In addition, the potential impact of left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) and coexisting functional mitral regurgitation (MR) on the efficacy of statin therapy was not considered. We prospectively studied 1,563 patients with AMI. The primary endpoint was readmission for the treatment of HF. The effect of statin therapy initiated before hospital discharge was evaluated using a Cox model, adjusting for clinical variables, a propensity score for statin therapy, LVEF, and MR grade. Patients with recurrent infarctions were censored. Statins were prescribed in 1,048 patients (67.1%) before hospital discharge. During a median follow-up of 17 months, admissions for HF were lower in patients receiving statins (6.5% vs 14.8%; unadjusted hazard ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.63, p <0.0001). In a multivariable Cox model, statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction of hospitalization for HF (HR 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.89, p = 0.009). There was a significant interaction between MR and statin therapy (p = 0.039), such that the beneficial effect of statins on HF hospitalizations was most pronounced in patients without concomitant MR and absent in patients with hemodynamically significant MR. In conclusion, in patients with AMI statin therapy initiated before hospital discharge significantly reduces subsequent hospitalizations for HF. The effect of statins is driven largely by the reduction in events in patients without concomitant hemodynamically significant MR.", 
    "108": "High systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a predictor of survival for patients with heart failure (HF). Whether SBP predicts survival in both ischemic and nonischemic HF has not been well examined. We analyzed 2,178 patients with advanced HF (47.3% ischemic etiology, 75.5% men, 93.5% New York Heart Association class III or IV, age 52 +/- 13, left ventricular ejection fraction 24 +/- 9%) referred to a university center between 1983 and 2006. SBP and invasive hemodynamic variables were recorded after optimization of medical therapy. Patients were divided into SBP quartiles (<or=90, 91 to 100, 101 to 112, >or=113 mm Hg) based on SBP frequency. Survival free from death or urgent transplant in ischemic versus nonischemic HF was 53.2% versus 61.1% at 2 years. Higher SBP quartile was associated with increased survival in the total cohort and in subgroups of both nonischemic and ischemic HF. On multivariate analysis adjusting for age, left ventricular ejection fraction, cholesterol, gender, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, New York Heart Association class, beta-blocker use, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker use, statin use, and smoking history, relative risk (95% confidence interval) of death or urgent transplant at 2 years for quartile 1 compared with quartile 4 was 1.9 (1.4 to 2.6) in the total cohort, 1.6 (1.1 to 2.5) in nonischemic HF, and 2.4 (1.5 to 3.7) in ischemic HF. In conclusion, SBP predicts HF survival in both ischemic and nonischemic HF independent of other risk factors and invasive hemodynamic variables.", 
    "109": "The benefit from statin therapy is proportional to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction. However, adverse events appear to be related to dose rather than LDL cholesterol reduction. Although serious side effects are rare, any comparison of statins requires scrutiny of the relation between therapeutic effect and risk of side effects. This report sought to determine whether the additional LDL cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin over atorvastatin could be obtained without increased risk of short-term adverse events. Twenty-five studies (approximately 20,000 patients) were identified that provided 28 comparisons of 1:1 dose ratios, 20 comparisons of 1:2 dose ratios, and 6 comparisons of 1:4 dose ratios. Treatment difference in benefit (percentage of LDL cholesterol reduction) and risk (odds ratios for myalgia, increased alanine aminotransferase >3 times the upper limit of normal, creatine kinase >10 times the upper limit of normal, and percentage of change in glomerular filtration rate, as well as deaths, serious adverse events, and withdrawals caused by adverse events) were estimated using meta-analysis and presented in benefit-risk planes. Rosuvastatin was more efficacious than the same dose of atorvastatin (1:1 dose ratio) or a 2 times higher dose (1:2 dose ratio) of atorvastatin. There was no significant difference between rosuvastatin and a 4 times higher dose of atorvastatin (1:4 dose ratio). There were no significant differences between rosuvastatin and atorvastatin at any dose ratio for adverse events. Percentages of change in GFR improved significantly with both treatments. In conclusion, at 1:1 and 1:2 dose ratios, significant additional decreases in LDL cholesterol were obtained using rosuvastatin compared with atorvastatin at a similar risk of the adverse events presented.",

Changes in the content of some functional components (GABA, FAAs, statins, isoflavones) and physical (pH, titratable acidity, water-holding capacity), biological (viable cell counts), and sensory characteristics of sogurts during fermentation and cold storage were examined. The medicinal sogurt contained significantly (p < 0.05) high levels of FAAs (2011.2 +/- 8.1 mg/100 g of dry weight of sogurt), GABA (45.5 +/- 1.9 mg), statins (100.1 +/- 7.5 microg), and isoflavone aglycones (56.4 +/- 4.6 mg) compared with the control sogurt (1167.1 +/- 8.1 mg, 32.1 +/- 2.5 mg, not detected, and 19.2 +/- 1.9 mg, respectively) after fermentation for 24 h at 35 degrees C. During cold storage for 30 days at 4 degrees C, medicinal sogurt displayed higher water-holding capacity and titratable acidity and total bacterial cells and lower pH than the control sogurt (p < 0.05). Overall sensory acceptability of medicinal sogurt supplemented with MFSE was higher than that of the control sogurt prepared without MFSE. The results indicate that the addition of the appropriate MFSE concentrations (1.5%, w/v) improved the physicochemical properties as well as sensory characteristics of soy yogurt, resulting in enhanced health-benefit ingredients and consumers' preferences.", 
    "111": "The FT-Raman quantification of atorvastatin calcium in tablets was performed using the partial least squares (PLS), principal component regression (PCR) and counter-propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANN) methods. To compare the predictive abilities of the elaborated models, the relative standard errors of prediction (RSEP) were calculated. The application of PLS, PCR and 6x6 CP-ANN provided models of comparable quality. RSEP error values in the range of 1.9-2.8% for calibration and validation data sets were obtained for the three procedures applied. Four commercial products containing 10, 20 or 40 mg of atorvastatin calcium per tablet were successfully quantified. Concentrations found from the Raman data analysis correlate strongly with the declared values, with a recovery of 98.5-101.3%, and with the results of reference analysis, with the recovery of 98.9-102.1%, for the different models. The proposed procedure can be a fast, precise and convenient method of atorvastatin calcium quantification in commercial tablets.",

This review describes the ongoing discussion about this issue and the complex pathophysiology of cardiac cachexia and chronic heart failure with particular focus on immunological, metabolic, and hormonal aspects at the intracellular and extracellular level. These include regulators such as neuropeptide Y, leptin, melanocortins, ghrelin, growth hormone, and insulin. The regulation of feeding is discussed as are nutritional aspects in the treatment of the disease. The mechanisms of wasting in different body compartments are described. Moreover, we discuss several therapeutic approaches. These include appetite stimulants like megestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and cannabinoids. Other drug classes of interest comprise angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, anabolic steroids, beta-adrenergic agonists, anti-inflammatory substances, statins, thalidomide, proteasome inhibitors, and pentoxifylline.",

Follow-up visits are at 1 and 4 months, and every 4 months thereafter. If consecutive measures of LDL-C are >79 mg/dL at follow-up visits, the simvastatin dose will be increased to 80 mg in a double-blind manner.

Postprandial lipemia was induced by administration of whipping cream containing 33% fat (1 g fat/kg body weight). FMD was determined by two-dimensional ultrasonography of the brachial artery in the fasting state and 4 h after the fatty meal. Lipids were determined using routine methods.",

In animal studies of angiotensin II (AngII)-infused rats, atorvastatin showed only mild inhibitory effects on AngII-induced cardiovascular hypertrophy, whereas fasudil, a selective Rho-kinase inhibitor, significantly suppressed it. Statins had no inhibitory effects on RhoA/Rho-kinase, but inhibited both membrane and GTP-bound Rac1 in the heart, whereas fasudil only inhibited Rho-kinase activity. Furthermore, the combination of atorvastatin and fasudil showed more effective inhibitory effects than fasudil alone.

    "132": "One important cardioprotective function of HDL is to remove cholesterol from lipid-laden macrophages in the artery wall. HDL also exerts anti-inflammatory effects that might inhibit atherogenesis. However, HDL has been proposed to be dysfunctional in humans with established coronary artery disease (CAD), though the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we used mass spectrometry to investigate the roles of HDL proteins in inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Shotgun proteomic analysis identified multiple complement regulatory proteins, protease inhibitors, and acute-phase response proteins in HDL, strongly implicating the lipoprotein in inflammation and the innate immune system. Moreover, mass spectrometry and biochemical analyses demonstrated that HDL3 from subjects with clinically significant CAD was selectively enriched in apolipoprotein E, suggesting that it carries a distinctive protein cargo in humans with atherosclerosis. HDL from CAD subjects also contained markedly elevated levels of chlorotyrosine and nitrotyrosine, two characteristic products of myeloperoxidase, indicating that oxidative damage might generate dysfunctional HDL. Aggressive lipid therapy with a statin and niacin remodeled the HDL proteome to resemble that of apparently healthy subjects. Collectively, our observations indicate that quantifying the HDL proteome by mass spectrometry should help identify novel anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective actions of HDL and provide insights into lipid therapy.",

    "135": "It is well recognized that both rate control and rhythm control are important strategies for the management of AF, but each approach should be chosen according to individual patient circumstances. A vast majority of elderly, relatively asymptomatic patients will benefit from ventricular rate control. Embolic stroke remains a major complication of AF. Yet, anticoagulation with warfarin remains underprescribed, especially in the elderly due to the presumed risk of bleeding. The technique of catheter ablation continues to improve and is generally successful in younger patients with relatively normal hearts.", 
    "136": "There are clinically relevant differences among published schemes designed to stratify stroke risk in patients with AF. The CHADS2 score is currently the most simple system to give some initial estimate of stroke risk in AF patients, but could significantly underestimate this risk, particularly in those who fall in the 'intermediate' risk category.",

New antithrombotic agents with efficacy similar to warfarin which do not require regular INR testing appear to be promising, but there are lack of data about their long-term safety. There is increasing evidence that inflammation and fibrosis may play a major role in the initiation and maintenance of AF. Statins by means of their pleotropic effects and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers by preventing atrial remodelling may prove useful in preventing the development of AF. However, there is insufficient evidence to expand the use of these agents to a wider patient population at risk of AF. It needs to be seen if strategies towards primary and secondary prevention with treatment of underlying heart disease and modification of risk factors have a larger effect than specific interventions in preventing the burden of AF in the general population.",

    "142": "We evaluated the pharmacological effect of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) on mast cell degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. A hydrophilic statin (pravastatin) did not inhibit degranulation induced by dinitrophenol-human serum albumin (DNP-HSA); in contrast, lipophilic statins (simvastatin, fluvastatin and atorvastatin) inhibited DNP-HSA-induced degranulation in that order. The inhibitory effects were completely attenuated by simultaneous treatment with 100-1000 microM mevalonic acid for 4 h. We used fluvastatin to clarify the mechanism of the statin-mediated inhibitory action of mast cell degranulation. Fluvastatin (3 microM) had no effect on Ca(2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum or Ca(2+) influx in the DNP-HSA- or thapsigargin-stimulated cells. Fluvastatin treatment also had no effect on the total granule content of the cell or sensitivity to DNP-HSA and IgE. Fluvastatin (3 microM, 24 h treatment) also failed to affect the morphology, proliferation, and viability of RBL-2H3 cells. Geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, GGTI-286 (20 microM), but not farnesyl transferase inhibitor, FPTIII (20 microM), inhibited the DNP-HSA-induced degranulation. The GGTI-286-induced inhibitory action was not associated with a decrease in the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) level. In conclusion, fluvastatin at a lower concentration range inhibited DNP-HSA-induced degranulation without affecting the cytoplasmic Ca(2+) response and also without changing the amount of granule content and proliferation of the mast cells. The statin-induced inhibitory action may be mediated by the suppression of geranylgeranyl transferase via the depletion of intracellular mevalonic acid.", 
    "143": "Monocytes and T-cells play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). Transcriptome analysis of circulating mononuclear cells from carefully matched atherosclerotic and control patients will potentially provide insights into the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and supply biomarkers for diagnostic purposes. From patients undergoing coronary angiography because of anginal symptoms, we carefully matched 18 patients with severe triple-vessel CAD to 13 control patients without angiographic signs of CAD. All patients were on statin and aspirin treatment. Elevated soluble-ICAM levels demonstrated increased vascular inflammation in atherosclerotic patients. RNA from circulating CD4+ T-cells, CD14+ monocytes, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes, and macrophages was subjected to genome-wide expression analysis. In CD14+ monocytes, few inflammatory genes were overexpressed in control patients, while atherosclerotic patients showed overexpression of a group of Kr\u00fcppel-associated box - containing transcription factors involved in negative regulation of gene expression. These differences disappeared upon LPS-stimulation or differentiation towards macrophages. No consistent changes in T cell transcriptomes were detected. Large inter-individual variability prevented the use of single differentially expressed genes as biomarkers, while monocyte gene expression signature predicted patient status with an accuracy of 84%. In this comprehensive analysis of circulating cell transcriptomes in atherosclerotic CAD, cautious patient matching revealed only small differences in transcriptional activity in different mononuclear cell types. Only an indication of a negative feedback to inflammatory gene expression was detected in atherosclerotic patients. Transcriptome differences of circulating cells possibly play less of a role than hitherto thought in the individual patient's susceptibility to atherosclerotic CAD, when appropriately matched for clinical symptoms and medication taken.",

    "151": "Statins exert beneficial effects in chronically damaged tissues. Angiotensin II (ANG II) participates in liver fibrogenesis by inducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) expression. We investigate whether atorvastatin modulates ANG II-induced pathogenic effects in the liver. Male Wistar rats were infused with saline or ANG II (100 ng kg(-1) min(-1)) for 4 wk through a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Rats received either vehicle or atorvastatin (5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) by gavage. ANG II infusion resulted in infiltration of inflammatory cells (CD43 immunostaining), oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal), hepatic stellate cells (HSC) activation (smooth muscle alpha-actin), increased intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), and interleukin-6 hepatic gene expression (quantitative PCR). These effects were markedly blunted in rats receiving atorvastatin. The beneficial effects of atorvastatin were confirmed in an additional model of acute liver injury (carbon tetrachloride administration). We next explored whether the beneficial effects of atorvastatin on ANG II-induced actions are also reproduced at the cellular level. We studied HSC, a cell type with inflammatory and fibrogenic properties. ANG II (10(-8)M) stimulated cell proliferation, proinflammatory actions (NF-kappaB activation, ICAM-1 expression, interleukin-8 secretion) as well as expression of procollagen-alpha(1(I)) and TGF-beta1. All of these effects were reduced in the presence of atorvastatin (10(-7)M). These results indicate that atorvastatin attenuates the pathogenic events induced by ANG II in the liver both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, statins could have beneficial effects in conditions characterized by hepatic inflammation.",

We previously showed that pravastatin and simvastatin reduced the electronegative LDL subfraction, fast-migrating LDL (fLDL), as analyzed by capillary isotachophoresis (cITP). The present study examined the effects of rosuvastatin on the more electronegative LDL subfraction, very-fast-migrating LDL (vfLDL), and small, dense charge-modified LDL (sd-cm-LDL) subfractions. Patients with hypercholesterolemia or those who were being treated with statins (n = 81) were treated with or switched to 2.5 mg/d rosuvastatin for 3 months. Rosuvastatin treatment effectively reduced cITP cm-LDL subfractions of LDL (vfLDL and fLDL) or sdLDL (sd-vfLDL and sd-fLDL), which were closely related to each other but were different from the normal subfraction of LDL [slow-migrating LDL (sLDL)] or sdLDL (sd-sLDL) in their relation to the levels of remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C), apolipoprotein (apo) C-II, and apoE. The percent changes in cm-LDL or sd-cm-LDL caused by rosuvastatin were correlated with those in the particle concentrations of LDL or sdLDL measured as LDL-apoB or sdLDL-apoB and the levels of HDL-C, RLP-C, apoC-II, and apoE. In conclusion, rosuvastatin effectively reduced both the vfLDL subfraction and sd-cm-LDL subfractions as analyzed by cITP.", 
    "153": "Cerebral vasospasm is one of the major complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The delayed occurrence of this complication allows for preventive management and early therapeutic interventions. Yet, accurate and timely diagnosis remains challenging and therapeutic options are rather limited. This review discusses new developments in the diagnosis and medical management of cerebral vasospasm made possible by technological advances and growing understanding of the complex pathophysiology of this disorder. CT protocols including CT perfusion and MRI with diffusion and perfusion sequences are increasingly employed in the evaluation of patients with suspected vasospasm. These radiological studies can add important information to that provided by transcranial Doppler and conventional angiography. Nimodipine for the prevention of delayed functional sequelae and hemodynamic augmentation therapy for the treatment of symptomatic vasospasm remains the mainstay of medical management. Novel strategies under investigation include the use of endothelin receptor antagonists, magnesium sulphate and statins. The value of albumin is being formally studied in an ongoing trial. Interventions to enhance nitric oxide may prove viable in the near future.", 
    "154": "The purpose of the study is to design bilayer floating tablets of diltiazem HCI and lovastatin to give immediate release of lovastatin and controlled release of diltiazem HCl and to study the influence of presence of one drug on the release pattern of other drug. The bilayer tablets consist of sodium starch glycolate as superdisintegrant for lovastatin in the immediate release layer and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) K4M and Xanthan gum as release-retarding agents for diltiazem HCl in the controlled release layer. Sodium bicarbonate was used as the gas generating agent. Dicalcium phosphate was used as the channeling agent. The direct compression method was employed for preparation of the bilayer tablets. Various physicochemical parameters were evaluated for the prepared tablets. The physicochemical parameters were found to be within range. There was significant difference in drug release and floating lag time (P < 0.05). All the formulations showed good matrix integrity. All the formulations released lovastatin within 30 min. The diffusion exponent for diltiazem HCl was found to be independent of polymer concentration. The release pattern of diltiazem HCI was fitted to different models based on coefficient of correlation (R). All the formulations followed the Higuchi model, except F1 which followed the Peppas model. HPMC K4M and Xanthan gum retarded the release of diltiazem HCl for 12 h. The release of one drug remained unaffected in presence of the other drug. In conclusion, such kind of combined dosage forms can effectively be formulated to deliver more than one drug so as to have improved patient compliance and better disease management.",

Factors independently associated with optimal RF control in patients with PAD were male gender (OR=1.9); residence in North America (OR=3.5), Japan (OR=2.5) or Latin America (OR=1.5); previous coronary revascularization (OR=1.3); and statin use (OR=1.4); whereas prior leg amputation was a negative predictor (OR=0.7) (P<0.001).

    "159": "Although sirolimus (SRL) use in renal allograft recipients (RTX) is associated with improved renal function, proteinuria develops in a significant proportion. 48 SRL-treated RTX were evaluated for development of proteinuria and stratified by level of proteinuria after SRL therapy. The Proteinuria Group (n = 25, 52.1%) had new-onset proteinuria or >25% increase in proteinuria following SRL conversion; the Nonproteinuria Group had stable proteinuria <0.5 g/day throughout. There was a higher proportion of male RTX and female donors to male recipients in the Proteinuria Group, (24% vs. 10%, P = 0.008). Calcineurin inhibitor- and statin usage were significantly higher in the Nonproteinuria Group (8% vs. 17%, P = 0.046; 28% vs. 83%, P < 0.001 respectively) whereas biopsy-proven acute rejection was higher in the Proteinuria Group (68% vs. 33%, P = 0.037). SDS-PAGE analysis of urine from 23 RTX in the Proteinuria Group demonstrated glomerular proteinuria in 100% and tubular proteinuria in 87%. While male gender and gender mismatch may impact on glomerular proteinuria through inadequate nephron dose and subsequent hyperfiltration, concurrent cyclosporine use may mitigate the development of proteinuria in SRL-treated patients, through afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Glomerular injury occurring following acute rejection may further contribute to glomerular proteinuria. Statins, through their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects, may protect against development of proteinuria.", 
    "160": "Chinese red yeast rice (RYR), a food herb made by fermenting Monascus purpureus Went yeast on white rice, contains a mixture of eight different monacolins that inhibit cholesterogenesis and also red pigments with antioxidant properties. Monacolin K (MK) is identical to lovastatin (LV). Both LV and RYR contain statins, which could inhibit de novo cholesterogenesis, which is critical to the growth of tumor cells. Dysregulation of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway has been demonstrated during progression to androgen independence in xenograft models, and it has been proposed that cholesterogenesis and androgen receptor (AR) up-regulation are essential to androgen-independent cell survival. This study was designed to examine the differences between the effects of RYR and LV on androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and androgen-independent cells overexpressing AR (LNCaP-AR). RYR showed more potent inhibition effect on prostate cancer cell growth compared to LV. Both the pigment and monacolin-enriched fractions purified from RYR inhibited proliferation (P < .001) to a lesser extent than intact RYR. While mevalonate, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), restored proliferation in LV-treated cells, it failed to do so in RYR-treated cells. Expression of the HMGCR gene was up-regulated by LV (P < .001) but not RYR in both LNCaP and LNCaP-AR cells. These results suggest that the RYR matrix beyond MK alone may be bioactive in inhibiting androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer growth. In vivo studies are needed to further establish the potential advantages of RYR over LV in prostate cancer chemoprevention and in the prevention of the emergence of androgen independence.", 
    "161": "High fructose intake contributes to the overall epidemic of obesity and metabolic disease. Here we examined whether atorvastatin treatment blocks the activation of the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) in the fructose-fed rat. Fructose feeding increased blood pressure (21%, P < 0.05), plasma free fatty acids (59%, P < 0.01), and plasma triglyceride levels (129%, P < 0.001) compared with control rats fed standard chow. These increases were prevented by atorvastatin. Rats fed the fructose-rich diet showed enhanced hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (Gpat1) (1.45-fold induction, P < 0.05), which is the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of triglycerides, and liver triglyceride content (2.35-fold induction, P < 0.001). Drug treatment inhibited the induction of Gpat1 and increased the expression of liver-type carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (L-Cpt-1) (128%, P < 0.01). These observations indicate that atorvastatin diverts fatty acids from triglyceride synthesis to fatty acid oxidation, which is consistent with the reduction in liver triglyceride levels (28%, P < 0.01) observed after atorvastatin treatment. The expression of Gpat1 is regulated by ChREBP and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Atorvastatin treatment prevented fructose-induced ChREBP translocation and the increase in ChREBP DNA-binding activity while reducing SREBP-1c DNA-binding activity. Statin treatment increased phospho-protein kinase A (PKA), which promotes nuclear exclusion of ChREBP and reduces its DNA-binding activity. Human HepG2 cells exposed to fructose showed enhanced ChREBP DNA-binding activity, which was not observed in the presence of atorvastatin. Furthermore, atorvastatin treatment increased the CPT-I mRNA levels in these cells. Interestingly, both effects of this drug were abolished in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89.", 
    "162": "These findings indicate that atorvastatin inhibits fructose-induced ChREBP activity and increases CPT-I expression by activating PKA.",

    "165": "A 12-member national expert panel was selected to represent practice in different regions of Canada. Potential quality indicators were identified by a detailed search of published guidelines, randomized trials and outcomes studies. A two-step modified Delphi process was employed with an initial screening round of indicator ratings, followed by a national quality indicator panel meeting, and follow-up discussions to obtain consensus.", 
    "166": "A total of 26 indicators including six structure indicators, nine process indicators, and 11 outcomes indicators were identified by the national expert panel to be representative of high quality of care for PCI. Pharmacological indicators included prescription of acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel and statin therapy as adjunctive therapy for PCI. Nonpharmacological process indicators included minimal procedure volumes, door-to-balloon time in primary PCI, prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy and selected patient education counselling instructions. Outcome indicators included death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularization and vascular access complications after PCI.", 
    "167": "A new set of PCI quality indicators for use in the Canadian health care system was developed. The widespread adoption and implementation of PCI quality indicators in clinical practice will facilitate the identification of practice gaps to enable quality improvement efforts and to optimize the outcomes of patients undergoing PCI throughout Canada.", 
    "168": "The direct health care costs associated with treating hypertension and dyslipidemia continue to grow in most western countries, including Canada. Despite the proven effectiveness of hypertension and lipid therapies to prevent cardiovascular disease, the cost-effectiveness of long-term primary prevention, as currently advocated by Canadian treatment guidelines, remains to be determined.", 
    "169": "Therapeutic efficiency, defined as person-years of treatment per year of life saved (YOLS) and the cost-effectiveness of treatment were estimated for groups of Canadian adults, 40 to 74 years of age. The clinical indications for treatment were based on the Canadian national guidelines in 2005. Analyses focused on those without cardiovascular disease or diabetes using risk factor data from the Canadian heart health surveys and drug data from a national study, the MyHealthCheckUp survey. The expected impact of therapy was based on published results: statins would result in a 40% drop in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a 6% increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, while hypertension therapy would result in a 6.4% drop in systolic and a 5.6% drop in diastolic blood pressure.", 
    "170": "The estimated daily cost of statins was $1.98 versus $1.72 for antihypertensives. Overall, 2.33 million patients would be treated with lipid therapy and 2.34 million with antihypertensives. The average cost-effectiveness of lipid therapy would be approximately $16,700 per YOLS while hypertension therapy would be approximately $37,100 per YOLS. Lifelong lipid and hypertension therapy would be associated with 1.1 million and 472,000 life years saved at a national cost of $18.3 billion and $17.5 billion, respectively. However, hypertension treatment for some groups of Canadians appeared relatively expensive (more than $50,000 per YOLS) including men or women younger than 50 years of age. Despite attractive cost-effectiveness ratios, treatment appeared relatively inefficient (person-years of treatment per YOLS more than 100 years) for statin therapy among women younger than 50 years of age, and hypertension treatment for women younger than 60 years of age and men younger than 50 years of age.", 
    "171": "Given Canadian guidelines, the treatment of dyslipidemia or hypertension in primary prevention appears economically attractive overall. However, for some groups of individuals, the forecasted future benefits appear to be relatively small given the many years of treatment that are required.", 
    "172": "Bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are early precursors of mature endothelial cells which replenish aging and damaged endothelial cells. The authors studied a diabetic swine model to determine if induction of DM adversely affects either bone marrow or circulating EPCs and whether a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) improves development and recruitment of EPCs in the absence of cholesterol lowering. Streptozotocin was administered to Yorkshire pigs to induce DM. One month after induction, diabetic pigs were treated with atorvastatin (statin, n = 10), ezetimibe (n = 10) or untreated (n = 10) and evaluated for number of bone marrow and circulating EPCs and femoral artery endothelial function. There was no effect of either medication on cholesterol level. One month after induction of DM prior to administration of drugs, the number of bone marrow and circulating EPCs significantly decreased (P < 0.0001) compared to baseline. Three months after DM induction, the mean proportion of circulating EPCs significantly increased in the atorvastatin group, but not in the control or ezetimibe groups. The control group showed progressive reduction in percentage of flow mediated vasodilatation (no dilatation at 3 months) whereas the atorvastatin group and ezetimibe exhibited vasodilatation, 6% and 4% respectively. DM results in significant impairment of bone marrow and circulating EPCs as well as endothelial function. The effect is ameliorated, in part, by atorvastatin independent of its cholesterol lowering effect. These data suggest a model wherein accelerated atherosclerosis seen with DM may, in part, result from reduction in EPCs which may be ameliorated by treatment with a statin.", 
    "173": "Statins, which act primarily to lower plasma LDL-cholesterol, are prescribed to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, but treatment response is variable. Genetic variation may modify both statin efficacy and susceptibility to statin-induced adverse drug reactions. Pharmacogenomic studies of statin response using candidate-gene and genome-wide strategies have begun to uncover polymorphisms associated with statin-mediated changes in LDL-cholesterol and CVD risk. The contribution of individual genetic determinants to overall response variation is small, but the combined effects of multiple genotypes may be more substantial. Initial observations must be replicated across multiple statin clinical trials and in multiple population groups of differing race and ethnicity before they can be assessed for clinical utility.", 
    "174": "Improved cardiovascular survival during statin treatment might be due to effects in addition to cholesterol lowering. We hypothesize that sodium intake affects renal function and vasoactive hormones in atorvastatin-treated healthy subjects.", 
    "175": "In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study we measured the effect of a moderate change in sodium intake on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), blood pressure (BP), renal tubular function, plasma concentrations of vasoactive hormones and urinary excretion of aquaporin-2 (u-AQP2) in 22 healthy subjects. The subjects were randomized to standardized fluid intake and diet corresponding to the need for calories in the 4 days before each of the 2 examination days. In one of the periods they were randomized to receive sodium chloride tablets (2 g) thrice daily for 4 days. Two doses of atorvastatin (80 mg) were given; one at 2200 h the evening before the study day, the other at 0830 h in the morning.", 
    "176": "24-h urinary sodium excretion increased by 23%. GFR and BP were unchanged. Sodium clearance, fractional excretion of sodium and u-AQP2 increased, whereas free water clearance decreased during high sodium intake. PRC and aldosterone were suppressed during the high sodium diet.", 
    "177": "A change in dietary sodium intake of approximately 100 mmol daily does not change GFR and BP in atorvastatin-treated healthy men. The lack of change in BP might reflect that the subjects studied were not sodium sensitive, or that atorvastatin treatment modified sodium sensitivity."
