We studied pathological material from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP, N = 445). Cortical and hippocampal atrophy, and atherosclerosis at the circle of Willis (large vessel disease, LVD) and arteriolosclerosis (small vessel disease, SVD) were rated by neuropathologists unaware of this study's hypothesis. Quantitative measures of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, specifically neuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) burden, were also obtained. Chronic micro and macroscopic infarcts were noted. In ordinal logistic regression models that included age at death, sex, apoE genotype, statin-use, A\u03b2 and NFT, more severe LVD was significantly associated with more severe cortical and hippocampal atrophy. The odds ratio for the association of the most severe LVD (compared to the least) with cortical atrophy was 2.7 (CI: 1.5-4.7) p = 0.001; for hippocampal atrophy the odds ratio was 2.8 (CI: 1.5-5.2), p = 0.001. The association of SVD with atrophy did not follow a consistent pattern. Neither macroscopic infarcts nor microscopic infarcts were associated with cortical or hippocampal atrophy (p's > 0.15). Tangle density was associated with cortical (p = 0.014) and hippocampal atrophy (p < 0.001). In contrast, amyloid burden was associated with less cortical (p = 0.02) or hippocampal (p = 0.002) atrophy. In this large autopsy study LVD was associated with cortical and hippocampal atrophy. The relationship between SVD and atrophy requires further study.",

Gene expression studies may facilitate understanding of these associations. Participants from ongoing population-based studies were sampled for these longitudinal studies of peripheral blood microarray gene expression, and followed to incident diabetes. All sampled subjects were statin or thiazide users. Those who developed diabetes during follow-up comprised cases (44 thiazide users; 19 statin users), and were matched to drug-using controls who did not develop diabetes on several factors. Supervised normalization, surrogate variable analyses removed technical bias and confounding. Differentially-expressed genes were those with a false discovery rate Q-value<0.05. Among thiazide users, diabetes cases had significantly different expression of CCL14 (down-regulated 6%, Q-value=0.0257), compared with controls. Among statin users, diabetes cases had marginal but insignificantly different expression of ZNF532 (up-regulated 15%, Q-value=0.0584), CXORF21 (up-regulated 11%, Q-value=0.0584), and ZNHIT3 (up-regulated 19%, Q-value=0.0959), compared with controls.

The results of this study showed that the administration of either escitalopram or atorvastatin for 6 weeks was associated with a significant decrease in serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins, and serum malondialdehyde, and a significant increase in high density lipoproteins when compared with the atherosclerosis model group. Histopathological examination of the aortas from the test rats revealed significant regression of atherosclerotic changes, together with a significant decrease in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in the media of both the escitalopram group and the atorvastatin group when compared with the atherosclerosis model group. This study has shown that escitalopram reduced atherosclerotic changes, thus its use as an antidepressant in elderly patients should be considered.",

We found that 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm SIM significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of mouse bone marrow MSCs with no inhibition of cell proliferation, and enhanced the chemotactic capability of SDF-1\u03b1 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Next, we constructed a novel cell-free bone tissue engineering system using PLGA loaded with SIM and SDF-1\u03b1, and applied it in critical-sized calvarial defects in mice. New bone formation in the defect was evaluated by micro-CT, HE staining and immunohistochemistry. The results showed that PLGA loaded with SIM and SDF-1\u03b1 promoted bone regeneration significantly more than controls. We investigated possible mechanisms, and showed that SDF-1\u03b1 combined with SIM increased MSC migration and homing in\u00a0vivo, promoted angiogenesis and enhanced the expression of BMP-2 in newly-formed bone tissue. In conclusion, SIM enhanced the chemotactic capability of SDF-1\u03b1 and the cell-free bone tissue engineering system composed of SIM, SDF-1\u03b1 and scaffold promoted bone regeneration in mouse critical-sized calvarial defects.",

We specifically focused on statins and assessed the yearly variation of statin expenditure by calculating the increased rate of paired pharmaceutical expenditures over a 2 year period. Our study classified statins into three categories: new entrants, core medicines and exiting medicines. For core medicines, we further examined influencing factors such as price, amount of drugs consumed by volume, and prescription changes (substitutes for other drug).",

Among the different statins, the expenditure of atorvastatin showed a 36.6% annual increase rate, which was the most dramatic among all statins. Also we divided expenditure for core medicines by the price factor, volume factor, and prescription change. The result showed that annual weighted average prices of individual drug decreased each year, which clearly showed that price influenced statin expenditure in a negative direction. The use of generic drugs containing the same active ingredient as name-brand drugs increased and negatively affected statin expenditure (Generic Mix effect). However, the use of relatively expensive ingredients within statin increase, Ingredient Mix effect contributed to increased statin expenditure (Ingredient Mix effect). In particular, the volume effect was found to be critical for increasing statin expenditure as the amount of statin consumed increased steadily throughout the study period.",

In order to check drug expenditures effectively in our current situation, in which chronic diseases remain steadily on the rise, it is necessary to not only have supply-side initiatives such as price reduction, but also demand-side initiatives that could control drug consumption volume, for example: educational programs for rational prescription, generic drug promotional policies, and policies providing prescription targets.",

Post-RP statin use remained associated with reduced risk of BCR after adjusting for preoperative serum cholesterol levels. In secondary analysis, after stratification by race, this protective association was significant in non-black (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.32-0.75; P = 0.001) but not black men (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.53-1.28; P = 0.384).",

The rs20455 genotype of each subject was determined by a multiplex assay using a Luminex-OLA procedure. The risk allele Trp719Arg was present in 77% of the subjects. The genotype distribution was 23% Trp/Trp, 51% Arg/Trp, and 26% Arg/Arg. Genotype did not predict the presence of CHD risk factors. Moreover, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides mean values did not vary as a function of genotype. However, those with the Arg/Arg genotype on statin medication exhibited a significantly higher mean triglycerides level (P < 0.01). Approximately 60% of participants regardless of genotype exhibited LDL-C levels \u2265100\u2009mg/dL but were not taking medication. Approximately 43% of those with the Trp719Arg risk allele on statins exhibited elevated LDL-C levels. Our study suggests that the Trp719Arg allele of KIF 6 rs20455 is common among Filipino-American women; thus, even with borderline LDL-C levels would benefit from statin treatment. Secondly, many participants did not exhibit guideline recommended LDL-C levels including many who were on statin drugs.", 
    "51": "The two-phase sampling design is a cost-efficient way of collecting expensive covariate information on a judiciously selected sub-sample. It is natural to apply such a strategy for collecting genetic data in a sub-sample enriched for exposure to environmental factors for gene-environment interaction (G \u00d7 E) analysis. In this paper, we consider two-phase studies of G \u00d7 E interaction where phase I data are available on exposure, covariates and disease status. Stratified sampling is done to prioritize individuals for genotyping at phase II conditional on disease and exposure. We consider a Bayesian analysis based on the joint retrospective likelihood of phase I and phase II data. We address several important statistical issues: (i) we consider a model with multiple genes, environmental factors and their pairwise interactions. We employ a Bayesian variable selection algorithm to reduce the dimensionality of this potentially high-dimensional model; (ii) we use the assumption of gene-gene and gene-environment independence to trade-off between bias and efficiency for estimating the interaction parameters through use of hierarchical priors reflecting this assumption; (iii) we posit a flexible model for the joint distribution of the phase I categorical variables using the non-parametric Bayes construction of Dunson and Xing (2009). We carry out a small-scale simulation study to compare the proposed Bayesian method with weighted likelihood and pseudo likelihood methods that are standard choices for analyzing two-phase data. The motivating example originates from an ongoing case-control study of colorectal cancer, where the goal is to explore the interaction between the use of statins (a drug used for lowering lipid levels) and 294 genetic markers in the lipid metabolism/cholesterol synthesis pathway. The sub-sample of cases and controls on which these genetic markers were measured is enriched in terms of statin users. The example and simulation results illustrate that the proposed Bayesian approach has a number of advantages for characterizing joint effects of genotype and exposure over existing alternatives and makes efficient use of all available data in both phases.",

Pooled relative risk (RR) estimates with their 95%CI were calculated using fixed- and random-effects models.

It is unclear whether methods for confounding adjustment that have been shown to perform well in small, simple nonrandomized studies are applicable to the large, complex pharmacoepidemiologic studies created from secondary healthcare data. Ordinary simulation approaches for evaluating the performance of statistical methods do not capture important features of healthcare claims. A statistical framework for creating replicated simulation datasets from an empirical cohort study in electronic healthcare claims data is developed and validated. The approach relies on resampling from the observed covariate and exposure data without modification in all simulated datasets to preserve the associations among these variables. Repeated outcomes are simulated using a true treatment effect of the investigator's choice and the baseline hazard function estimated from the empirical data. As an example, this framework is applied to a study of high versus low-intensity statin use and cardiovascular outcomes. Simulated data is based on real data drawn from Medicare Parts A and B linked with a prescription drug insurance claims database maintained by Caremark. Properties of the data simulated using this framework are compared with the empirical data on which the simulations were based. In addition, the simulated datasets are used to compare variable selection strategies for confounder adjustmentvia the propensity score, including high-dimensional approaches that could not be evaluated with ordinary simulation methods.

Mast cells can be activated by immunoglobulins and in the present study, we aimed to establish whether specific immunoglobulins in plasma of patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy were related to (activated) intraplaque mast cell numbers and plasma tryptase levels.

    "74": "Mice were inoculated with 1 \u00d7 10(6) plaque-forming units (PFU/ml) of DENV-2 and treated with LOV (200 mg/kg/day). Pre-treatment with one or three doses of LOV increased the survival rate compared to untreated mice (7.3 and 7.1 days, respectively, compared to 4.8 days). Viremia levels also decreased by 21.8% compared to untreated mice, but only in the group administered three doses prior to inoculation. When LOV was administered after viral inoculation, the survival rate increased (7.3 days in the group treated at 24 hpi, 6.8 days in the group treated at 48 hpi and 6.5 days in the group treated with two doses) compared to the untreated group (4.8 days). Interestingly, the serum viral titer increased by 24.6% in mice treated at 48 hpi with a single dose of LOV and by 21.7% in mice treated with two doses (at 24 and 48 hpi) of LOV compared to untreated mice. Finally histopathological changes in the liver and spleen in infected and untreated mice included massive extramedullary erythropoiesis foci and inflammatory filtration, and these characteristics were decreased or absent in LOV-treated mice.", 
    "75": "Our results suggest that the effect of LOV on viremia depends on the timing of treatment and on the number of doses administered. We observed a significant increase in the survival rate in both schemes due to a delay in the progression of the disease. However, the results obtained in the post-treatment scheme must be handled carefully because this treatment scheme increases viremia and we do not know how this increase could affect disease progression in humans.", 
    "76": "Plasma cholesterol lowering (PCL) slows and sometimes prevents progression of atherosclerosis and may even lead to regression. Little is known about how molecular processes in the atherosclerotic arterial wall respond to PCL and modify responses to atherosclerosis regression. We studied atherosclerosis regression and global gene expression responses to PCL (\u226580%) and to atherosclerosis regression itself in early, mature, and advanced lesions. In atherosclerotic aortic wall from Ldlr(-/-)Apob (100/100) Mttp (flox/flox)Mx1-Cre mice, atherosclerosis regressed after PCL regardless of lesion stage. However, near-complete regression was observed only in mice with early lesions; mice with mature and advanced lesions were left with regression-resistant, relatively unstable plaque remnants. Atherosclerosis genes responding to PCL before regression, unlike those responding to the regression itself, were enriched in inherited risk for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, indicating causality. Inference of transcription factor (TF) regulatory networks of these PCL-responsive gene sets revealed largely different networks in early, mature, and advanced lesions. In early lesions, PPARG was identified as a specific master regulator of the PCL-responsive atherosclerosis TF-regulatory network, whereas in mature and advanced lesions, the specific master regulators were MLL5 and SRSF10/XRN2, respectively. In a THP-1 foam cell model of atherosclerosis regression, siRNA targeting of these master regulators activated the time-point-specific TF-regulatory networks and altered the accumulation of cholesterol esters. We conclude that PCL leads to complete atherosclerosis regression only in mice with early lesions. Identified master regulators and related PCL-responsive TF-regulatory networks will be interesting targets to enhance PCL-mediated regression of mature and advanced atherosclerotic lesions.",

Rates of the primary adverse limb outcome (worsening claudication/new episode of critical limb ischaemia, new percutaneous/surgical revascularization, or amputation) at 4 years and the composite of cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction/stroke were compared among statin users vs. non-users.", 
    "79": "A total of 5861 patients with symptomatic PAD were included. Statin use at baseline was 62.2%. Patients who were on statins had a significantly lower risk of the primary adverse limb outcome at 4 years when compared with those who were not taking statins [22.0 vs. 26.2%; hazard ratio (HR), 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-0.92; P = 0.0013]. Results were similar when statin use was considered as a time-dependent variable (P = 0.018) and on propensity analysis (P < 0.0001). The composite of cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction/stroke was similarly reduced (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73-0.96; P = 0.01).",

Three-month-old male WHHL rabbits were treated with either probucol(85 mg/kg/day) or atorvastatin(6 mg/kg/day) for 16 weeks, and their plasma lipid levels and atherosclerotic lesions were compared with those of a control group.",

In spite of this, probucol treatment led to a prominent reduction of aortic en face lesions by 39%(P\uff1c0.01), whereas atorvastatin reduced these by 16%(P\uff1e0.05), compared with those in the control. Histological examinations revealed that the aortic lesions of probucol-treated rabbits were characterized by reduced macrophages and increased smooth muscle cells compared with those from both the control and atorvastatin groups. Furthermore, probucol treatment reduced the coronary artery stenosis and increased the plaque stability.",

We studied the effects of unidirectional flow of medium, produced by orbital rotation of cultures, on morphology and protein expression in bEnd.3 mouse brain ECs. Flow altered the expression of key transcription factors and gasotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes, and increased NO production. Statins and angiotensin receptor blockers reproduced the effect of flow on endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression. Thus, flow modified brain EC properties and function in vitro, with similarities and possible differences compared to previous studies on systemic ECs. Thus, the effect of flow on brain ECs can be modeled in vitro and may assist the investigation of mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease.", 
    "86": "The problem of noise has recently gained more attention as it has become an integral part of our daily lives. However, its influence has yet to be fully elucidated. Other than being an unpleasant stimulus, noise may cause health disorders through annoyance and stress, including oxidative stress. Rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, may possess antioxidant properties. Based on rat models, our project investigates the effect of rosuvastatin on noise-induced oxidative stress in the brain tissue. Thirty-two male Wistar albino rats were used. The rats were divided into four groups: Noise exposure plus rosuvastatin usage, only noise exposure, only rosuvastatin usage, and control. After the data had been collected, oxidant and antioxidant parameters were analyzed in the cerebral cortex, brain stem, and cerebellum. Results indicated that superoxide dismutase values were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex, while malondialdehyde values in the brainstem and cerebellum were significantly increased in the group with only noise exposure. Superoxide dismutase values in the brainstem were significantly increased, but nitric oxide values in the cerebellum and brainstem and malondialdehyde values in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex were significantly decreased in the group where only rosuvastatin was used. During noise exposure, the use of rosuvastatin caused significantly increased superoxide dismutase values in the cerebral cortex and brainstem, but significantly reduced malondialdehyde values in the brain stem. Consequently, our data show that brain tissue was affected by oxidative stress due to continued exposure to noise. This noise-induced stress decreases with rosuvastatin therapy.", 
    "87": "Atherosclerosis research has classically followed 2 intertwining lines of investigation concerning atherosclerosis as a local process (the \"high-risk plaque\") and as a systemic disease (the \"high-risk patient\"). Over time, the weight of attention has swung, like a pendulum, between these 2 related foci. With optimal medical therapy and attention to risk factors firmly established as fundamental aspects of management, in the past year, we have nevertheless perceived a shift in the pendulum toward renewed focus on the local plaque. We contend that this shift results from a convergence of major advances in understanding the biology of plaque progression, novel sophisticated invasive and noninvasive imaging modalities for the in vivo characterization of plaque composition and inflammation, and emerging data and technologies that have renewed interest in locally targeted interventions. Here, we review the dynamic and exciting progress that has occurred over the last 12 months in this arena, while acknowledging future work that remains to be done to refine and validate new imaging modalities and therapies.", 
    "88": "The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, also known as the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, is an essential cellular pathway that is involved in diverse cell functions. The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGCR) is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis and catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to MVA. Given its role in cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis, the regulation of HMGCR has been intensely investigated. Because all cells require a steady supply of MVA, both the sterol (i.e. cholesterol) and non-sterol (i.e. isoprenoid) products of MVA metabolism exert coordinated feedback regulation on HMGCR through different mechanisms. The proper functioning of HMGCR as the proximal enzyme in the MVA pathway is essential under both normal physiologic conditions and in many diseases given its role in cell cycle pathways and cell proliferation, cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism, cell cytoskeletal dynamics and stability, cell membrane structure and fluidity, mitochondrial function, proliferation, and cell fate. The blockbuster statin drugs ('statins') directly bind to and inhibit HMGCR, and their use for the past thirty years has revolutionized the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases, in particular coronary heart disease. Initially thought to exert their effects through cholesterol reduction, recent evidence indicates that statins also have pleiotropic immunomodulatory properties independent of cholesterol lowering. In this review we will focus on the therapeutic applications and mechanisms involved in the MVA cascade including Rho GTPase and Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, statin inhibition of HMGCR, geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase) inhibition, and farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibition in cardiovascular disease, pulmonary diseases (e.g. asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), and cancer.", 
    "89": "We have recently reported that CXCR7, the alternate high affinity SDF-1 receptor, is induced during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, leading to increased macrophage phagocytosis linked to atherosclerosis. Statins, the most widely used medications for atherosclerosis, were shown to have pleiotropic beneficial effects independent of their cholesterol-lowering activity. This study aimed to determine whether induction of CXCR7 during macrophage differentiation is inhibited by statins and its significance on macrophage physiology. Here we show for the first time that atorvastatin dose-dependently inhibited CXCR7 mRNA and protein expression in THP-1 macrophages, without affecting the other SDF-1 receptor, CXCR4. Pharmacotherapy relevant dose of atorvastatin affected neither cell viability nor macrophage differentiation. Suppression of CXCR7 expression was completely reversed by supplementation with mevalonate. Inhibition of squalene synthase, the enzyme committed to cholesterol biosynthesis, also decreased CXCR7 induction, albeit not as efficacious as atorvastatin. However, the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, GGTI-286, the farnesyl transferase inhibitor, FTI-276, and the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, all failed to mimic the effect of atorvastatin, suggesting that the protein prenylation pathways are not critical for atorvastatin inhibition of CXCR7 induction. Interestingly, the dramatic effect of atorvastatin was only partially mimicked by other statins including pravastatin, fluvastatin, mevastatin, and simvastatin. Furthermore, activation of CXCR7 by SDF-1, TC14012, or I-TAC all prompted macrophage migration, which was significantly suppressed by atorvastatin treatment, but not by the CXCR4 antagonist. We conclude that atorvastatin modulates macrophage migration by down-regulating CXCR7 expression, suggesting a new CXCR7-dependent mechanism of atorvastatin to benefit atherosclerosis treatment beyond its lipid lowering effect.", 
    "90": "Inflammatory processes and oxidative stress are known to play a key role in the development of cardiovascular complications such as cardiac hypertrophy induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), the most characteristic pathophysiological change of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Current evidence suggests that competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA coenzyme A reductase, such as atorvastatin, not only reduce blood lipids but also have anti-inflammatory and inhibit oxidative stress benefits. This study examined the protective role of atorvastatin in CIH-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Adult male wistar rats were subjected to 8h of intermittent hypoxia/day, with/without atorvastatin for 6 weeks. Ventricular remodeling, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88), inflammatory agents and radical oxygen species were determined. As a result, we found that treatment with atorvastatin markedly inhibited the mRNA and protein expressions of TLR4, MYD88 and the downstream inflammatory agents and radical oxygen species. Administration of atorvastatin following CIH significantly ameliorated the myocardial injury, such as cardiac hypertrophy. In conclusion, Pre-CIH atorvastatin administration may attenuate TLR-4/MYD88 mediated inflammatory processes and oxidative stress in the injured rat myocardium, and this may be one mechanism by which atorvastatin ameliorated myocardial injury following CIH.",

    "94": "We found that simvastatin dose-dependently decreased CCL17-induced colon cancer cell migration. Simvastatin had no effect on colon cancer cell proliferation or apoptosis. Inhibition of beta chemokine receptor 4, CCR4, reduced CCL17-evoked activation of RhoA in colon cancer cells. Moreover, administration of mevalonate reversed the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on CCL17-induced colon cancer cell migration. Interestingly, co-incubation with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) antagonized the inhibitory impact of simvastatin on colon cancer cell migration triggered by CCL17. Moreover, we observed that simvastatin decreased CCL17-induced activation of RhoA in colon cancer cells. Administration of mevalonate and GGPP reversed the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on CCL17-provoked RhoA activation in colon cancer cells.", 
    "95": "Taken together, our findings show for the first time that HMG-CoA reductase regulates CCL17-induced colon cancer cell migration via inhibition of geranylgeranylation and RhoA activation.

    "96": "Incomplete endothelialization and neointimal hyperplasia of injured arteries can cause acute and late stent thromboses. This work develops hybrid stent/biodegradable nanofibers for the local and sustained delivery of rosuvastatin to denuded artery walls. Biodegradable nanofibers were firstly prepared by dissolving poly(D,L)-lactide-co-glycolide and rosuvastatin in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. The solution was then electrospun into nanofibrous tubes, which were mounted onto commercially available bare-metal stents. The in\u00a0vitro release rates of the pharmaceuticals from the nanofibers were determined using an elution method and a high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The experimental results thus obtained suggest that the biodegradable nanofibers released high concentrations of rosuvastatin for four weeks. The effectiveness of the local delivery of rosuvastatin in reducing platelets was studied. The tissue inflammatory reaction caused by the hybrid stents that were used to treat diseased arteries was also documented. The proposed hybrid stent/biodegradable rosuvastatin-loaded nanofibers contributed substantially to the local and sustainable delivery of a high concentration of drugs to promote re-endothelialization, improve endothelial function, reduce inflammatory reaction, and inhibit neointimal formation of the injured artery. The results of this work provide insight into how patients with a high risk of stent restenosis should be treated for accelerating re-endothelialization and inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia.",

We conducted post hoc analyses in 23,508 participants from 3 large-scale multicenter atorvastatin randomized blinded clinical trials: Treating to New Targets, the Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering, and the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels. The main outcome measure was the incidence of clinical AVS over a median follow-up of 4.9 years (82 cases). Among patients who developed AVS, 39 (47.6%) were treated with atorvastatin 80 mg and 43 (52.4%) were treated with lower dose statin (atorvastatin 10 mg in Treating to New Targets, simvastatin 20 to 40 mg in Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering, or placebo in Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels; hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59 to 1.41, p=0.67). In multivariate analyses forcing treatment, sex, and race into the model, factors that were significantly associated with AVS included age (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.93, p<0.0001 per 1-SD increment), diabetes (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.80, p=0.05), vitamin K antagonist use (HR 3.25, 95% CI 2.06 to 5.16, p<0.0001), and previous statin use (HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.54 to 4.60, p=0.0008).

The aim of this study was to determine if FB1, alone and combined with DON or \u03b1-zearalenol (ZEA), zearalenone major active metabolite, can affect granulosa cell proliferation, steroid production, and gene expression in swine. Porcine granulosa cells were cultured for 2 days in serum-containing medium followed by 1 or 2 days in serum-free medium with or without added treatments. Fumonisin B1 had inhibitory effects on granulosa cell proliferation. Deoxynivalenol strongly inhibited cell growth, and no significant difference was detected in combination with FB1. \u03b1-Zearalenol showed a stimulatory effect on granulosa cell numbers even in combination with FB1. Regarding steroid production, FB1 increased progesterone production, and FB1 had no effect on estradiol production. Deoxynivalenol strongly inhibited progesterone and estradiol production, and FB1 had no significant effect on this response. \u03b1-Zearalenol increased progesterone production, and its combination with FB1 produced additive effects. \u03b1-Zearalenol had no effect on estradiol production, whereas it decreased estradiol production when co-treated with FB1. Fumonisin B1 was found to decrease CYP11A1 messenger RNA abundance, and the stimulatory effect of FB1 on progesterone production was found to be not dependent on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity suggesting that FB1 increases progesterone production through a different mechanism.

We compared clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics and in-hospital, 30-day, 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year outcomes in 3,512 patients discharged after STEMI with and without (6%) statin prescriptions in the harmonizing outcomes with revascularization and stents in acute myocardial infarction trial (www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00433966).

At every time point of follow-up after discharge, patients with no discharge statin prescription had significantly higher rates of net adverse clinical events, major adverse cardiac events, major bleeding unrelated to bypass surgery, and death. After multivariable adjustment, absence of a discharge statin prescription independently predicted 3-year major adverse cardiac event (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.07, p=0.0037) and death (hazard ratio 2.30, 95% confidence interval 1.41 to 3.77, p=0.0009).

Alongside statin therapy, which is maintained to be an effective method of CVD prevention, there are alternative methods such as vitamin B substitution therapy with folic acid (FA), and vitamins B12 and B6 . B-vitamins may inhibit atherogenesis by decreasing the plasma level of homocysteine (Hcy)-a suspected etiological factor for atherosclerosis-and by other mechanisms, primarily through their antioxidant properties. Although Hcy-lowering vitamin trials have failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of B-vitamins in the prevention of CVD, a meta-analysis and stratification of a number of large vitamin trials have suggested their effectiveness in cardiovascular prevention (CVP) in some aspects. Furthermore, interpretation of the results from these large vitamin trials has been troubled by statin/aspirin therapy, which was applied along with the vitamin substitution, and FA fortification, both of which obscured the separate effects of vitamins in CVP. Recent research results have accentuated a new approach to vitamin therapy for CVP. Studies undertaken with the aim of primary prevention have shown that vitamin B substitution may be effective in the primary prevention of CVD and may also be an option in the secondary prevention of disease if statin therapy is accompanied by serious adverse effects. Further investigations are needed to determine the validity of vitamin substitution therapy before its introduction in the protocol of CVD prevention.",

    "161": "Microphysiological systems provide a tool to simulate normal and pathological function of organs for prolonged periods. These systems must incorporate the key functions of the individual organs and enable interactions among the corresponding microphysiological units. The relative size of different microphysiological organs and their flow rates are scaled in proportion to in vivo values. We have developed a microphysiological three-dimensional engineered human skeletal muscle system connected to a circulatory system that consists of a tissue-engineered blood vessel as part of a high-pressure arterial system. The engineered human skeletal muscle tissue reproduces key mechanical behaviors of skeletal muscle in vivo. Pulsatile flow is produced using a novel computer-controlled magnetically activated ferrogel. The system is versatile and the muscle unit can be integrated with other organ systems. Periodic monitoring of biomechanical function provides a non-invasive assessment of the health of the tissue and a way to measure the response to drugs and toxins.", 
    "162": "Statins have pleiotropic effects which include anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. In the present study, dendritic cells treated with atorvastatin (statin-DCs) could be induced into tolerogenic DCs. Administration of these tolerogenic DCs ameliorated clinical symptoms in experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), which was associated with reduced number of inflammatory cells in sciatic nerves, inhibited CD4(+) T cells proliferation, down-regulated expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86) and MHC class II, decreased levels of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17A, increased number of NKR-P1(+) cells (including NK and NKT cells), up-regulated number of Treg cells in lymph node MNC as well as increased Foxp3 expression in the thymus. These data indicated that statin-DCs could develop as a new therapeutic strategy to GBS in the future.", 
    "163": "Thyroid hormones (THs) play multiple roles in the organism and alterations of their levels can result in many pathological changes. Currently, we use hyperthyroid and hypothyroid rats as \"models of a diseased organism\" and analyze whether n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) administration can ameliorate TH-induced pathophysiological changes. We investigate myosin heavy chain composition, calsequestrin levels, changes in cardiac tissue remodeling and cell-to-cell communication, expression of protein kinases, mitochondrial functions, oxidative stress markers and cell death, changes in serum lipid levels, activities of key enzymes of thyroid hormone metabolism, activity of acetylcholine esterase and membrane anisotropy, as well as mobile behavior and thermal sensitivity. Additionally we also mention our pilot experiments dealing with the effect of statin administration on skeletal muscles and sensory functions. As THs and n-3 PUFA possess multiple sites of potential action, we hope that our complex research will contribute to a better understanding of their actions, which can be useful in the treatment of different pathophysiological events including cardiac insufficiency in humans.",

    "173": "Drug-induced phospholipidosis (PLD) is characterized by phospholipid accumulation within the lysosomes of affected tissues, resulting in lysosomal enlargement and laminar body inclusions. Numerous adverse effects and toxicities have been linked to PLD-inducing drugs, but it remains unknown whether drug-induced PLD represents a distinct toxicity or cellular adaptation. In silico and immortalized cellular models have been used to evaluate the PLD potential of new drugs, but these systems have some limitations. The aims of this study were to determine whether primary sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH) can serve as a sensitive and selective model to evaluate hepatic drug-induced PLD, and to evaluate the impact of PLD on the uptake and biliary excretion of probe substrates, taurocholate (TC) and rosuvastatin (RSV). Rat SCH were cultured for 48 h with prototypic hepatic PLD-inducing drugs, amiodarone (AMD), chloroquine (CHQ), desipramine (DES), and azithromycin (AZI), as well as the renal PLD inducer gentamicin (GTM). LysoTracker Red localization and transmission electron microscopy indicated enlarged lysosomal compartments and laminar body inclusions in SCH treated with AMD, CHQ, DES, and AZI, but not GTM, relative to control. PLD resulted in a 51-92% decrease in the in vitro biliary clearance of both TC and RSV; the biliary excretion index significantly decreased for TC from 88 to 35-73%. These data suggested that PLD significantly reduced both organic anion transporting polypeptide-mediated uptake, and bile salt export pump-mediated biliary transport processes. The current study demonstrates that the rat SCH system is a promising model to study hepatic PLD in vitro. Altered hepatic transport of anionic substrates secondary to drug-induced PLD is a novel finding.",

    "175": "A total of 6632 subjects from the EPHESUS trial were used to derive the predictive model, while 5477 subjects from the OPTIMAAL trial were used to validate the model. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to develop a multivariate risk score predictive of all-cause mortality. The SPIM risk score integrated lab and vital parameters, Killip class, reperfusion or revascularization, the number of cardiac evidence-based medicines (aspirin, statin, \u03b2 blocker, ACEI/ARB, aldosterone blocker), and the number of cardiac risk factors. The model was predictive of all-cause mortality after myocardial infarction, with an AUC of 0.75 at 6 months and 0.75 at 2 years in the derivation cohort and 0.77 and 0.78 for the same time points in the validation cohort. Model predicted versus Kaplan-Meier observed survival was excellent in the derivation cohort. It remained so in the validation cohort--84.9% versus 85.0% at 2 years. The 10% of subjects with the highest predicted risk had approximately 25 times higher mortality at 2 years than the 10% of subjects with the lowest predicted risk.", 
    "176": "The SPIM score was a powerful predictor of outcomes after myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction. Its highly accurate predictions should improve patient and physician understanding of survival and may prove a useful tool in post-infarct risk stratification.", 
    "177": "Simvastatin (Sim) is approved as lipid-controlling drug in patients with cardiovascular risk to reduce hypercholesterolemia. Recent publications indicate possible inhibitory effects of Sim on tumor cell lines, and epidemiological data suggest activity in cancer patients. Still, its therapeutic efficacy, particularly in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), remains to be elucidated. This study analyzes the effects of Sim on HNSCC cell lines (KB, HN5, FaDu) and on a larger set of primary HNSCC cells by employing a short-time ex vivo colony formation test (FLAVINO assay). Possible additive or synergistic effects of Sim combinations with established chemotherapeutics are determined as well.",

    "187": "Patients with the risk for atherosclerotic disease will be targeted to reduce the existing hyperlipidemia. The hypolipidemic activity of Phellinus rimosus was studied using triton WR-1339 and high cholesterol diet (HCD) induced models. The triton induced elevated lipid profile was attenuated by P. rimosus or standard drug atorvastatin. Similarly, administration of P. rimosus along with HCD significantly decline serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, with elevating the high-density lipoprotein. Thiobarbituric acid reacting substances in heart and liver significantly decreased; where as activity of enzymatic antioxidants and level of reduced glutathione were significantly increased. In both models, P. rimosus extract showed a significant ameliorative effect on the elevated atherogenic index as well as LDL/HDL-C ratio. The hypolipidemic activity of P. rimosus can be ascribed to its inhibitory effect on the liver HMG CoA reductase activity. The results suggest the possible therapeutic potential of this fungus as hypolipidemic agent.",

However, the frequency and predictors of intensive statin therapy use after AMI among patients with DM have not been described. We examined patterns of intensive statin therapy use (defined as a statin with expected low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering of >50%) at discharge among patients with AMI with known DM enrolled in a 24-site US registry. Predictors of intensive statin therapy use were evaluated using multivariable hierarchical Poisson regression models. Among 1,300 patients with DM after AMI, 22% were prescribed intensive statin therapy at hospital discharge. In multivariable models, ST-elevation AMI (risk ratio [RR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29 to 1.70), insurance for medications (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.63), and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (RR 1.05 per 1\u00a0mg/dl, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.07) were independent predictors of intensive statin therapy, whereas higher Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events scores were associated with lower rates of intensive statin therapy (RR 0.94 per 10 points, 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98). In conclusion, only 1 in 5 patients with DM was prescribed intensive statin therapy at discharge after an AMI. Predictors of intensive statin therapy use suggest important opportunities to improve quality of care in this patient population.",

This retrospective study of patients with the diagnosis of CAD, PAD, or both CAD and PAD compared lipid levels and statin use. For comparison of statins, we used a statin potency unit (1 potency unit=10 mg of simvastatin). Among 11,134 subjects (CAD 9,563, PAD 596, and both CAD and PAD 975), mean LDL in the PAD group was higher than the CAD (92 vs 83 mg/dl, respectively, p<0.001) and the combined CAD and PAD groups (92 vs 80 mg/dl, respectively, p<0.001). Fewer patients with PAD achieved a target LDL of <100 mg/dl compared with CAD (62% vs 78%, respectively, p<0.001) and the combined group (62% vs 79%, respectively, p<0.001).

Compared with the CAD group, a lesser number of patients with PAD received statin therapy (76% vs 100%, respectively, p<0.001) with lower mean potency unit (5.3 vs 8.1, respectively, p<0.001). In conclusion, our study demonstrated lower use and less aggressive application of statins in patients with PAD compared with patients with CAD, ensuing lower mean LDL in the CAD and combined PAD and CAD groups. Our study suggests that physicians are more aggressive with lipid control in patients with CAD compared with patients with PAD alone.",

Numerous medications used to manage CVD (e.g., statins and antihypertensives) are hypothesized to alter breast cancer risk, but there are few studies on breast cancer outcomes. The COmmonly used Medications and Breast Cancer Outcomes (COMBO) cohort was developed to study how medications and co-morbidities influence breast cancer prognosis. Cohort study among adult women, diagnosed with incident early stage breast cancer, and enrolled in an integrated health plan. Data sources included health plan administrative databases, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results tumor registry, and medical records. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), beta blockers (BB), calcium blockers, and diuretics were the exposures of interest. The outcome was second breast cancer events (SBCE) defined as recurrence or second primary breast cancer. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for SBCE, and components of SBCE. 4,216 women were followed for a median of 6.3 years, and 13.2 % experienced a SBCE (first of: n = 415 recurrences and n = 143 s primary breast cancers). Compared to non-users, we observed an increased risk of second primary breast cancer with ACEI use (HR = 1.66; 95 % CI, 1.06-2.58) and an increased risk of recurrence with BB use (HR = 1.29; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.64).

In summary, our study revealed positive consequences of these lipid-lowering drugs on erectile function, especially for nonresponders to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5Is). However, it has been reported that statin therapy may reduce levels of testosterone and aggravate symptoms of ED. Therefore, larger, well-designed RCTs are needed to investigate the double-edged role of statins in the treatment of ED.", 
    "219": "Short-term administration of statins during the perioperative period has been suggested to improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac and vascular surgery. The effectiveness of this therapy, the optimal administration time and the statin best suited to improve cardiac performance under hyperglycemic conditions, however, are unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of 10 mg/kg/day simvastatin (SV), pravastatin (PV) and atorvastatin (AV), on the CV status of fully anesthetized streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats 4 weeks following diabetes induction. At this stage, cardiac function is compromised. The rats were anesthetized to mimic presurgical conditions. Cardiac status was evaluated twice by echocardiography, first 24 h after statin administration, and then after daily statin administration for 1 week. After 24 h of statin administration, CV parameters were not improved. Continued daily administration of SV and AV over a 1-week period, by contrast, significantly improved ejection fraction from 52.20 \u00b1 2.33% before treatment to 64.89 \u00b1 1.12% with AV and to 69.71 \u00b1 2.30% with SV (n = 9, p < 0.05). The cardiac output index was also significantly improved from 51.13 \u00b1 6.86 ml/min \u00d7 100 g body weight (BW) before treatment to 98.74 \u00b1 13.78 ml/min \u00d7 100 g BW with AV and to 84.94 \u00b1 8.64 ml/min \u00d7 100 g BW with SV. Only AV increased stroke volume from 0.50 \u00b1 0.08 to 0.83 \u00b1 0.13 ml (n = 9, p < 0.05). Unlike the other statins tested, PV provided no beneficial effects, regardless of the regimen of administration. Our results indicate that daily administration of AV and SV for 1 week enhances cardiac performance in fully anesthetized diabetic rats. This study of short-term statin administration may have strong clinical implications for improving perioperative outcomes in diabetic patients.", 
    "220": "Lovastatin (LOV) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), besides improving cardiovascular functions, are also known for their anticancer activities. However, use of these compounds for treating or preventing cancer is limited because of their efficacies. The approach pursued involved chemical linkage of these two chemotypes. A lovastatin-docosahexaenoate (LOV-DHA) conjugate was prepared and tested against selected breast tumor cells lines with differential expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and Heregulin-2 (Her-2). The LOV-DHA conjugate exhibited superior cytotoxic effects against ER(-)/Her-2(-) cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468), which were not observed with DHA or lovastatin alone, or in combination. Lovastatin supplementation arrested cells in the G\u2080/G\u2081 phase and enhanced expression levels of p21, whereas the conjugate did not demonstrate cell cycle arrest nor increased p21 expression. The LOV-DHA conjugate induced significant (P<0.05) apoptosis as low as 1 \u03bcM, whereas DHA and lovastatin were ineffective at this concentration. The growth inhibitory effects of lovastatin were reversed by the addition of mevalonate, whereas mevalonate had no effect on the LOV-DHA conjugate-induced growth inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the LOV-DHA conjugates were stable in mouse serum and intracellularly in MDA-MB-231 cells. These data suggest that the LOV-DHA conjugate mediated its effects through a HMG-CoA reductase-independent pathway and exerted significantly (P<0.05) higher anticancer effects in breast cancer cells than lovastatin or DHA alone."
