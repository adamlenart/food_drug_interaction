Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to preserve renal function in various models of chronic renal failure. This study was performed to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, in the remnant kidney model.", 
    "1": "Two groups of animals were studied. Group 1 (n = 9) served as controls and group 2 (n = 14) received lovastatin, 15 mg/kg/day orally, for 2 weeks after renal ablation. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR, inulin clearance), renal blood flow (RBF, ultrasonic flow probe), and 24-hour protein excretion were measured in anesthetized rats.", 
    "2": "Two weeks after renal ablation, GFR was 0.28 +/- 0.09 mL/min/gkw (gram kidney weight) in group 1, whereas in group 2, lovastatin preserved GFR at 0.58 +/- 0.3 mL/min/gkw (P < 0.05). RBF in group 1 was 1.2 +/- 0.2 mL/min/gkw and increased to 2.1 +/- 0.4 mL/min/gkw in group 2 (P < 0.05), representing a 43% increase. Protein excretion decreased significantly to 13 +/- 1.7 mg/24 hr in group 2. The lovastatin-treated group had a lower serum cholesterol (59 +/- 3 mg/dL versus 71 +/- 2 mg/dL, P < 0.05), but serum triglyceride levels were not different between the two groups.", 
    "3": "Lovastatin preserves renal function in a renal ablation model after 2 weeks of treatment. It specifically increased total RBF. Therefore, in addition to its known cholesterol lowering effect, lovastatin also has the direct renal hemodynamic effect of increasing RBF and maintaining GFR.", 
    "4": "Previously we demonstrated that a hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, was actively taken up by the liver via the 'multispecific anion transporter' using isolated rat hepatocytes (M. Yamazaki, H. Suzuki, M. Hanano, T. Tokui, T. Komai, and Y. Sugiyama, Am. J. Physiol., 264, G36-G44 (1993)). Such a carrier-mediated uptake of pravastatin may contribute to the liver selective inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis in vivo. To examine the early-phase tissue distribution of this drug, we carried out a pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution analysis of pravastatin in rats. After i.v. bolus administration of [14C]pravastatin, the time profiles of [14C]radioactivity in plasma and several tissues were determined to calculate the tissue uptake clearance (CLuptake). Among the tissues examined, liver accounted for the major uptake (CLuptake,liver = 22.8 mL min-1 kg-1), followed by kidney (CLuptake,kidney (GFR corrected) = 2.36 mL min-1 kg-1). Other tissues showed no significant uptake (less than 0.2 mL min-1 kg-1). After portal vein administration, the distribution to the liver became much larger than that to the kidney due to the extensive first-pass removal by the liver. The first-pass hepatic uptake ratio was estimated as 0.66. Administering a range of doses (0.4-400 mumol kg-1) intravenously, an increase in early-phase half-life and a decrease in CLuptake,liver were observed simultaneously at doses over 40 mumol kg-1. In addition, CLuptake,kidney decreased at doses over 4 mumol kg-1. The effect of DBSP or PAH co-infusion (i.e. typical substrates for the transport system for organic anions in liver and kidney, respectively) on the initial uptake of pravastatin was also examined. DBSP clearly inhibited both the hepatic and renal uptake; however, PAH did not reduce the hepatic uptake of pravastatin although it inhibited the renal uptake. The transport systems in liver and kidney are thus considered different, based on the different saturability and inhibitory effect of organic anions.",

    "6": "Three patients receiving stable warfarin dosages with therapeutic international normalized ratios (INRs) exhibited increased INRs when fluvastatin was added to their maintenance regimens. While none of the patients experienced a bleeding episode, they did require a reduction in their weekly warfarin dosage to achieve an appropriate level of anticoagulation.", 
    "7": "Reports of an interaction between warfarin and lovastatin have been described previously; however, to our knowledge, this is the first published report of a possible interaction between warfarin and fluvastatin. These cases were chosen because other factors that could potentially increase the INR were ruled out as significant contributors.",

Lipid profiles were measured before and 1 month after treatment with fluvastatin 20 mg/d. Lipid profiles in a group of patients receiving concomitant therapy with prednisone (n = 12) were compared with those of patients who had not received steroids for at least 6 months (n = 8).",

Treatment failure was defined by LDL concentrations persistently above 160 mg/dL after 1 month of fluvastatin therapy. Safety was assessed clinically and by serial measurements of liver enzymes and creatine phosphokinase.", 
    "13": "LDL concentrations decreased significantly in both the steroid-treated and steroid-free groups after 1 month of fluvastatin therapy. There was no significant change in HDL concentrations or serum triglycerides in either group. Treatment failure was more common in patients receiving steroids (4/12 patients) than in steroid-free patients (1/8 patients). After 1 month of therapy, LDL cholesterol was significantly lower in the steroid-free group (126 +/- 18 mg/dL) than in the steroid-treated group (147 +/- 23 mg/dL) (p < 0.05). There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of myonecrosis in either group.",

    "16": "In patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, diet and lipid-lowering drugs are often insufficient to achieve optimal LDL cholesterol values. Low density lipoprotein apheresis is a very effective lipid-lowering therapy. Assessment of regional myocardial perfusion enables evaluation of the functional state of the coronary circulation.", 
    "17": "We studied 42 patients with severe hypercholesterolemia and extensive coronary artery disease who were randomized to diet and simvastatin with or without biweekly LDL apheresis. Regional myocardial perfusion was assessed by digital subtraction angiography with videodensitometric calculation of hyperemic mean transit time (HMTT) of contrast medium at baseline and after 2 years of therapy.", 
    "18": "Low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 63% (to 3.0 mmol/liter) in the LDL apheresis group and by 47% (to 4.1 mmol/liter) in the medication group. Paired HMTT measurements were assessed in 43 regions in the LDL apheresis group and 35 regions in the medication group. In the LDL apheresis group, regional HMTT decreased over 2 years from 3.35 +/- 1.18 (mean +/- SD) to 2.87 +/- 0.82 s (-14%, p = 0.001), whereas no change in the medication group was observed: 2.95 +/- 1.06 to 2.96 +/- 0.90 s (p = NS). In the patient-based comparison, the mean change in HMTT was -0.45 s (-14%, p = 0.01) in the LDL apheresis group and -0.05 s (-2%, p = NS) in the medication group, respectively. Only exercise-induced ischemia improved in the LDL apheresis group.",

After 2 years of therapy, regional myocardial perfusion improved in the LDL apheresis group and remained unchanged in the medication group. Thus, aggressive reduction of LDL cholesterol has a favorable effect on regional myocardial perfusion and alleviates ischemia.", 
    "20": "To characterize tissue-specific differences in insulin signaling, we compared the mechanisms of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation by insulin in the mitogenically active 3T3-L1 fibroblasts with the metabolically active 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In both cell lines, insulin significantly increased p21(ras).GTP loading (1.5-2-fold) and MAP kinase activity (5-8-fold). Inhibition of Ras farnesylation with lovastatin blocked activation of p21(ras) and Raf-1 kinase in both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, this was accompanied by an inhibition of the stimulatory effect of insulin on MAP kinase. In contrast, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, despite an inhibition of activation of p21(ras) and Raf-1 by lovastatin, insulin continued to stimulate MAP kinase activity. Fractionation of the cell lysates on the FPLC Mono-Q column revealed that lovastatin inhibited insulin stimulation of ERK2 (and, to a lesser extent, ERK1) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and had no effect on the insulin-stimulated ERK2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results demonstrate an important distinction between the mechanism of insulin signaling in the metabolically and mitogenically active cells. Insulin activates MAP kinase by the Ras-dependent pathway in the 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and by the Ras-independent pathway in the 3T3-L1 adipocytes.", 
    "21": "We assessed the potential benefit of treatment for low-risk and high-risk groups in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) population, and compared the benefits of primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) by lipid lowering with the benefits of blood pressure reduction in the primary prevention of stroke.", 
    "22": "We did a subgroup analysis of placebo-treated men in the WOSCOPS population by age, vascular disease at trial entry, and other established risk factors. We also compared WOSCOPS findings with those of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) trial of treatment for mild to moderate hypertension in middle-aged men. The WOSCOPS population comprised 6595 men aged 45-64 years with no history of myocardial infarction (MI) and plasma total cholesterol concentrations of 6.5-8.0 mmol/L at initial screening. Participants were randomly allocated pravastatin (40 mg daily) or placebo, and followed up for an average of 4.9 years.", 
    "23": "Coronary event rates at 5 years in the WOSCOPS placebo group were higher than 10% (the recommended treatment threshold) in men with pre-existing vascular disease and in those 55 years or older without symptoms or signs of CHD but with at least one other risk factor. Event rates were low in men with hypercholesterolaemia but no other risk factor: 3.5% (95% CI 1.3-5.7) for men aged 45-54 years and 5.3% (2.7-8.0) for men aged 55-64 years. Three times more men had to be treated for 5 years to prevent one endpoint in WOSCOPS than in 4S. By contrast, two to four times fewer men with hyperlipidaemia were treated to save one coronary event in WOSCOPS than hypertensives to save one stroke in the MRC trial. These differences persisted after adjustment for the low-risk status of many of the patients with hypertension who took part in the MRC trial.", 
    "24": "There were a substantial number of men whose risk of a coronary event was more than 10% at 5 years in the WOSCOPS cohort. The absolute benefit of pravastatin treatment of hyperlipidaemia is less in the primary prevention of CHD than in secondary prevention, but is similar to that for primary prevention of stroke by treatment of mild to moderate hypertension in middle-aged men.", 
    "25": "In this study, plasma NO2- and NO3- (NOx-) levels were studied after lowering cholesterol with simvastatin in 26 outpatients with hypercholesterolemia (male, 9; female, 17; mean age, 59 +/- 12 years; cholesterol level > 220 mg/dl). Simvastatin (5 mg) was orally administered once daily, and blood samples were collected before, and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. Total, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were lowered (total, 254 +/- 44 mg/dl to 209 +/- 34 mg/dl; VLDL, 48 mg/dl [5-126 mg/dl] to 34 mg/dl [10-67 mg/dl]; LDL, 171 +/- 41 mg/dl to 133 +/- 37 mg/dl), but high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was elevated (33 +/- 9.5 mg/dl to 39 +/- 11 mg/dl) at 12 weeks after starting simvastatin. Although the effects of simvastatin on the lipid levels nearly reached their maximum levels at 4 weeks, NOx- was elevated in a linear fashion with simvastatin (before; 8 +/- 17 mumol/l, at 12 weeks; 57 +/- 32 mumol/l). The % changes in the NOx- correlated directly with those in HDL-cholesterol at 12 weeks (P < 0.002) but not with other lipoprotein cholesterol fractions. These results suggest that simvastatin lowers cholesterol levels and elevates HDL while increasing the plasma NOx- levels.", 
    "26": "Protein modification by isoprenylation is essential in mammals and other eukaryotes, but has not been demonstrated in the parasitic protozoa of the order kinetoplastida. A key regulatory enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-R), and end products of the path, including dolichols, are present in Trypanosoma brucei. By metabolical labelling of procyclic form trypanosomes in the presence of compactin, an efficient inhibitor of HMG-R, followed by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we demonstrate that protein isoprenylation indeed takes place in this organism and at least 14 polypeptides bear the modification. Further characterization of labelled isoprenyl groups by methyl iodide cleavage and high pressure liquid chromatography identified both the farnesyl and geranylgeranyl moieties found covalently attached to proteins in other eukaryotes. The latter moiety was more abundant, as found in mammalian systems. Prolonged incubation with compactin grossly affected cell morphology and altered a number of subcellular structures as seen by electron microscopy. High concentrations of compactin were toxic, whilst lower concentrations were cytostatic. The primary morphological lesion is distinct from that of synvinolin, another inhibitor of HMG-R. The morphological changes correlated with a complete inhibition of HMG-R activity by compactin. Surprisingly there was a complete lack of HMG-R activity in procyclic cells grown for 1 or several days in 100 microM compactin, suggesting that degradation of the enzyme had occurred and compensatory upregulation mechanisms could not be successfully exploited by the parasite to overcome HMG-R inhibition. Subsequent alterations to the overall cell shape are seen after 3 days of compactin exposure. Overall these data indicate that T. brucei has an essential protein isoprenylation pathway that is conserved with the higher eukaryotes. Additionally, products of the MVA pathway are implicated in maintenance of cell architecture.", 
    "27": "Lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin are fairly strong inhibitors of sterol synthesis in human myoblasts in culture. Lovastatin and simvastatin have IC50 values of 19 +/- 6 nM and 4.0 +/- 2.3 nM, respectively. Pravastatin is a weaker inhibitor of sterol synthesis (IC50 value of 110 +/- 38 nM). Through inhibition of mevalonate production, these compounds have a distinct inhibiting effect on cell proliferation. Because proliferation of myoblasts is important in the repair of damaged skeletal muscle, experiments were performed to investigate the effect of lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin on cell proliferation and cell viability. The more potent inhibitors of sterol synthesis, lovastatin, and simvastatin, were able to inhibit the proliferation of these cells during 3 days of incubation with drug concentrations of 1 microM for lovastatin and 0.1 microM or 1 microM for simvastatin. DNA synthesis was decreased by more than 80% in the presence of 1 microM of lovastatin or simvastatin. In contrast, under these conditions, pravastatin had no influence on cell proliferation or DNA synthesis, which is probably related to the lack of inhibition of sterol synthesis by pravastatin on extended incubation. The three 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors did not disturb cell viability because mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and ATP content remained proportional to the number of cells in the culture at any concentration used.", 
    "28": "The anti-atherosclerotic effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors at doses insufficient to lower serum cholesterol was investigated in rabbit femoral artery denuded by balloon catheter. Fluvastatin and pravastatin were given orally at doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg per day, respectively, for 2 weeks after the catheterization. There was little change in serum cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipid by chronic treatment with the drugs. The cross-sectional area of the intima, expressed as relative values to media (I/M ratio), was increased by the catheterization, showing intimal thickening in the denuded arteries. The I/M ratio was reduced by fluvastatin but not pravastatin: 0.327 +/- 0.060 for control, 0.116 +/- 0.035 for 4 mg/kg fluvastatin, 0.088 +/- 0.027 for 8 mg/kg fluvastatin and 0.22 +/- 0.069 for 8 mg/kg pravastatin. Fluvastatin (8 mg/kg)-induced effect on the I/M ratio, was prevented by the combined administration with 40 mg/kg per day mevalonate, a metabolite in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. These results suggest that fluvastatin inhibits intimal thickening after catheterization-induced injury through percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and that the inhibition is presumably attributed to reduced migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells but not secondarily to a lowering of serum lipid.", 
    "29": "In order to assess the relative contributions of farnesylated and/or geranylgeranylated proteins on cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase we designed potent and selective farnesyltransferase (FTI-277) and geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTI-298) inhibitors. Flow cytometry studies showed that treatment of NIH3T3 cells with GGTI-298 or lovastatin, which inhibits both protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, arrested cells in G0/G1 whereas cells treated with FTI-277 progressed normally through the cell cycle. [3H]thymidine incorporation studies showed that mevalonate and geranylgeraniol, but not farnesol, released the lovastatin G1 block. Furthermore, mevalonate release of the lovastatin G1 block was inhibited by GGTI-298 but not by FTI-277. These results demonstrate that geranylgeranylated proteins are required for cells to proceed from G1 to S phase, and that farnesylated proteins do not play an essential role in the G1 to S phase transition", 
    "30": "Sixty-seven subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia were enrolled in an open study with \"low dosages\" of inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaril coenzyme A reductase. Patients were randomized in comparative and parallel study with simvastatin 10 mg (30 subjects) and pravastatin 20 mg (27 subjects) once in the evening for a treatment period of 12 months. At the end of the treatment the plasma concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol were reduced respectively by 21% (p < 0.001) and 29% (p < 0.001), plasma triglyceride concentration was reduced by 16%, high density lipoprotein (HDL) was increased by 2.9%. The efficacy of drugs was increasing during the study: at the third month 63% of subjects and at the twelfth month 89% of subjects showed a LDL < 160 mg/dL. In this study the drugs were well-tolerated, but 11 subjects showed a slight and transitory increase of CK. A treated group with simvastatin showed a similar decrease of the total cholesterol and LDL as that one treated with pravastatin. Pravastatin in comparison with simvastatin reduced significantly plasma triglycerides. There was no significant difference between the groups in the frequency of drug-related adverse effects. In conclusion \"low dosages\" of simvastatin and pravastatin in long term treatment were very efficacious in the reduction of total and LDL cholesterol. In our study, the decrease of total and LDL cholesterol was time-dependent, with the greatest reduction after sixth months. There were no significant differences between 10 mg of simvastatin and 20 mg of pravastatin on reduction of total and LDL cholesterol levels. Triglycerides decreased significantly only with pravastatin.", 
    "31": "The lipid-modifying profile of bezafibrate is characterised by marked decreases in elevated triglyceride levels, increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and decreases in total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Bezafibrate also reduces elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and fibrinogen, which are independent cardiovascular risk factors. Bezafibrate is effective in most types of primary and secondary dyslipidaemia. It is of greatest benefit in conditions featuring hypertriglyceridaemia and/or HDL cholesterol deficiency. This is particularly true for patients with diabetes mellitus, notably those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) who are also likely to have increased fibrinogen levels. In the limited comparisons available, there appear to be few consistent differences in lipid-modifying effects between bezafibrate and other fibrates. Compared with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, bezafibrate causes larger changes in triglyceride and, in general, HDL cholesterol levels, and has a lesser influence on LDL and total cholesterol levels. These differences are advantageous when bezafibrate and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are used as combined therapy in patients with severe dyslipidaemia unresponsive to either modality alone. The combination of bezafibrate plus an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in clinical trials has not led to the predicted increase in myalgia. Indeed, bezafibrate is generally free of serious unwanted effects: rhabdomyolysis is rare and has occurred mainly in patients with renal dysfunction given excessive dosages. Other patient groups in whom bezafibrate has improved serum lipid profiles are those with isolated HDL cholesterol deficiency, dyslipidaemia secondary to renal insufficiency, and following cardiac surgery or other procedures. However, data for these indications are not extensive. Evidence is now available to show a beneficial effect of bezafibrate on retarding atherosclerotic processes and in reducing risk of coronary heart disease. The 5-year Bezafibrate Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial (BECAIT) in young male survivors of myocardial infarction demonstrated a smaller decrease in luminal diameter and a reduction in coronary events with bezafibrate compared with placebo. The Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study is expected to provide mortality data which is currently lacking for bezafibrate. In conclusion, bezafibrate is a useful and well-tolerated lipid-modifying agent in the management of primary and secondary dyslipidaemia. It has particularly beneficial effects in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia and/or low HDL cholesterol levels, and reduces fibrinogen levels. Together with its ability to sustain or improve glycaemic control, these properties make it a logical choice for treating patients with diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia. Additionally, the drug may be of value as combination therapy in patients with severe dyslipidaemia. Importantly, there is evidence that the drug can slow the atherosclerotic process and reduce cardiovascular morbidity. The ongoing BIP secondary intervention study and other investigations will help clarify the effects of bezafibrate on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.", 
    "32": "If dietary therapy and other lifestyle changes do not adequately normalise blood lipid levels, lipid-regulating drugs, as single-drug or combination-drug therapy, may be prescribed to supplement lifestyle changes. Evaluation of the individual patient's health and risk status, determination of the dyslipidaemia, definition of treatment goals and a clear understanding of the mechanisms and effects of lipid-regulating agents are necessary for optimisation of treatment. Although all the available lipid-regulating agents lower low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the agents with the greatest LDL cholesterol-lowering effect are the bile acid sequestrants, which up-regulate the LDL receptor by the decrease in intrahepatic cholesterol caused by the interruption of enterohepatic circulation of cholesterol-rich bile acids, and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which partially inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. The agents with the greatest triglyceride-lowering effect are nicotinic acid, which decreases the production of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and reduces the availability of free fatty acids in the circulation, and the fibric acid derivatives, which increase lipoprotein lipase activity and may also decrease the release of free fatty acids. Although the safety profile of the available lipid-regulating drugs has been established, patients should be monitored for potential adverse effects and interactions with concomitantly administered agents. When used correctly, lipid-regulating drug therapy is highly effective in the treatment of a variety of dyslipidaemias.", 
    "33": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is the key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are potent reversible inhibitors of this enzyme, which act by competing for the substrate HMG-CoA. This review is mainly devoted to the 4 main HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors used today: lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin and fluvastatin. Depending upon the dosage, these drugs are able to reduce plasma cholesterol levels by more than 40%. After absorption, each undergoes extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism. Up to 5 primary metabolites are formed, some of which are active inhibitors. The elimination half-lives vary from 0.5 to 3.5 hours and excretion is mainly via the faeces. A limited number of drug interactions has been reported. Increases in liver enzymes and muscle creatine kinase activity are among the most severe adverse effects. These powerful drugs should be reserved for patients with high plasma cholesterol levels and/or those with cardiovascular disease. New therapeutic approaches to atherosclerosis are currently under investigation. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are the cornerstone of this research.", 
    "34": "The effect of fluvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was investigated on the adhesive interaction between U937 cells, the human monocyte cell line, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), focusing on the expression of adhesion molecules. U937 treated with fluvastatin lowered the capacity for binding to HUVEC. Fluvastatin at 0.1 microM or more inhibited the expression of lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on U937 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on U937. The expression of ICAM-1 on HUVEC was not inhibited by fluvastatin. The inhibitory effects of fluvastatin on the expression of adhesion molecules on U937 were completely reversed by the addition of mevalonate. Because fluvastatin did not affect the expression of other cell surface markers, CD4 and CD71, the inhibitory effects of fluvastatin on adhesion molecule expression could not be attributed to the non-specific suppression of the cell. It is conceivable that cellular interaction between monocytes and endothelial cells is inhibited by fluvastatin, mediated via reducing the expression of adhesion molecules, particularly in the side of monocyte.", 
    "35": "The effect of simvastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) was evaluated in an experimental model of myointimal hyperplasia in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Myointimal hyperplasia was induced by an air-drying injury of the left carotid artery followed by a 2%-cholesterol diet for 14 days. A 2-week oral treatment with simvastatin (6 mg/kg/day, p.o.) significantly lowered the circulating levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (41% and 49% inhibition respectively) as well as the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Simvastatin also strongly affected the uptake of cholesterol in the arteries occurring as a consequence of vascular injury (44% inhibition, P < 0.001). Morphometric analysis revealed that both the intima and the media areas increased substantially 2 weeks after the lesion and showed a considerable smooth muscle cell accumulation in the neointima together with the presence of numerous foam cells. A 16-day oral treatment with simvastatin strongly reduced smooth muscle cells hyperplasia occurring in both the media and the intima following deendothelialization (19% and 60% inhibition respectively) suggesting that simvastatin may be a useful inhibitor of restenosis which occurs following vascular injury.", 
    "36": "Hypolipidaemic agents do not usually normalize all of the multiple lipoprotein abnormalities in patients with familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL). The effect of the simvastatin-ciprofibrate combination in comparison with each drug alone on the lipoprotein abnormality patterns was studied in patients with FCHL and coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "37": "Sixty patients (53 men and seven women), mean age 52 years (range 36-60 years), were studied. After a 4-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to three groups. The first group (n = 20) received simvastatin (20 mg daily), the second group (n = 20) ciprofibrate (100 mg daily) and the third group (n = 20) the combination of both drugs for a 12-week period. Parameters measured were as follows: plasma fibrinogen, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein, intermediate density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as LDL subfraction distribution and structure by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Apoproteins (apo) B and AI were assessed by immunoturbidometry.", 
    "38": "At baseline, apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were increased, whereas LDL particles were small and dense. ApoB was significantly reduced by all three interventions. Drug combination and ciprofibrate significantly reduced plasma fibrinogen (-24 and -25%, respectively; P < 0.001) and triglycerides (-51 and -49%, respectively; P < 0.001). Drug combination and simvastatin significantly reduced LDL cholesterol (-25 and -22%, respectively; P < 0.001) compared with ciprofibrate (-10%; P < 0.01). Ciprofibrate and drug combination increased LDL particle size (parameter K -0.24 versus -0.61 and -0.30 versus -0.62, respectively; P < 0.001), whereas simvastatin had no significant effect on LDL particle size. The cholesterol content of LDL particles was reduced with ciprofibrate and the drug combination only in the dense LDL particles (LDL3-5) and increased in the light (LDL1-2) subfractions, whereas simvastatin reduced the cholesterol content of all LDL subfractions except LDL2. Ciprofibrate and drug combination reduced the triglyceride content of all LDL subfractions.", 
    "39": "Combined treatment with simvastatin and ciprofibrate effectively reduced plasma fibrinogen, triglycerides, total and LDL cholesterol and increased LDL particle size in patients with FCHL and CAD. These effects might induce a clinical benefit for these patients.", 
    "40": "Here we describe a direct approach for two-dimensional (2-D) gel mapping of proteins that are modified by post-translational isoprenylation in mammalian cells. Briefly, transformed human amnion cells (AMA) and transfected COS-1 cells were metabolically labeled with either [3H]farnesyl-pyrophosphate or [3H]geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate following treatment with lovastatin, which blocks the synthesis of mevalonic acid. The proteins were then separated by 2-D gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters. The membranes were immersed in dimethyl ether, containing 10% of 2,5-diphenyloxazole prior to fluorography. Over 40 [3H]farnesyl-labeled proteins and over 25 [3H]geranylgeranylated proteins were identified on the 2-D autoradiograms. Several [3H]farnesyl-labeled proteins exhibited the same coordinates (M(r) and pI) as their [3H]geranylgeranylated counterparts, raising the possibility that they may be substrates for both farnesyl and geranylgeranyl transferase(s). The approach offers high resolution of both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins and it may serve as a powerful tool for the identification of hitherto unknown prenylated proteins as well as for the determination of prenylated protein levels, type of isoprenoid modification, and possible changes in protein prenyltransferase activity.", 
    "41": "Guinea pigs were fed 15% (w/W) fat, high in lauric and myristic acids, a diet known to produce hypercholesterolemia in these animals. The diet was given alone or in combination with four doses of atorvastatin equivalent to 1, 3, 10, and 20 mg/kg per day. Atorvastatin reduced plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations by 46, 50, 53, and 70%, respectively (P < 0.001). Plasma apoB concentrations were reduced by atorvastatin (P < 0.001) and compositional changes occurred in VLDL and LDL with reductions of the relative proportion of cholesteryl ester and increases in triacylglycerol. A reduction in hepatic cholesteryl ester (66%) was observed only with the highest atorvastatin dose (20 mg/kg per day) while microsomal cholesterol was reduced by 30% with 3-20 mg/kg per day. Hepatic ACAT activity was down-regulated and apoB/E receptor number was increased by atorvastatin. In contrast, HMG-CoA reductase activity and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase were not affected by the drug. VLDL apoB secretion rates were decreased by atorvastatin treatment 59 and 76% with 3 and 20 mg/kg per day, respectively. Nascent VLDL particles were larger after drug treatment, showing an increased number in triacylglycerol molecules. These results support the hypothesis that the plasma LDL lowering induced by atorvastatin is due to a decreased secretion of apoB in combination with an increase of hepatic apoB/E receptors.", 
    "42": "The inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase, pravastatin and simvastatin, are widely used clinically as anti-hypercholesterolemic drugs. To determine whether these drugs affect hematopoiesis, we examined the effect of the drugs on colony formation by human bone marrow cells. Simvastatin strongly inhibited both erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage colony formation by total or CD34-positive bone marrow cells at the concentration of 10 microM, which is about 100-1,000 fold higher than the pharmacologically effective level. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of pravastatin was much weaker than that of simvastatin. These findings show that these drugs, especially pravastatin have little effect on hematopoiesis.", 
    "43": "Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is an endothelium-derived vasoactive substance which is released to the blood stream by exercise, blood occlusion, and desmopressin (DDAVP). The increased capacity of the plasma tPA level raised by these factors is thought to reflect in vivo endothelial function. On the other hand, endothelial dysfunction has been reported in patients with hypercholesteremia as well as in those with diabetes mellitus. Therefore, diabetic patients with hypercholesteremia were administered 5 mg of simvastatin daily for one month and plasma tPA responses evoked by DDAVP were examined before and after treatment for hypercholesteremia. While the treatment of simvastatin for one month significantly reduced serum cholesterol levels from 257 +/- 12 mg to 206 +/- 10 mg (no change in HbA1c was observed during the study), plasma tPA levels and % delta vWF (von Willebrand factor) following DDAVP infusion significantly increased from 11.4 +/- 1.2 ng/ml to 13.4 +/- 1.4 ng/ml and from 69.3 +/- 23.4% to 126.5 +/- 47.4%, respectively. However, neither increase in plasma levels of guanosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) nor change in the depressive response of blood pressure was observed following DDAVP infusion after the treatment of simvastatin. In addition, no change in urinary albumin excretion rate was observed with the treatment of hypercholesteremia. Therefore, it was suggested that improvement in hypercholesteremia may ameliorate vascular endothelial dysfunction in diabetic patients with hypercholesteremia and that hypercholesteremia may enhance endothelial dysfunction in these patients.", 
    "44": "Proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) plays an important role in vascular pathobiology by being involved in the development of coronary atherosclerosis and restenosis. Competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase have shown antiproliferative properties on different cell types. We have assessed the relative effectiveness of three HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (compactin, lovastatin and pravastatin) in blocking serum-induced replication of human and porcine SMCs. No effects were seen on DNA synthesis in porcine or human SMCs at the reported therapeutic lipid-lowering concentrations. The effectiveness of statins in blocking SMC proliferation was similar in both species; the IC50 values for porcine cells were 12.2 mumol L-1, 12.6 mumol L-1 and 1.16 mmol L-1 for lovastatin, compactin and pravastatin respectively. Inhibition of SMC proliferation was reversed by addition of mevalonate but not by low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Statins showed high anti-proliferative efficiency against purified growth factors involved in human restenosis (1 nmol L-1 platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 1 nmol L-1 epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 U mL-1 alpha-thrombin). The porcine model seems to be a suitable system, closely resembling the human model, for assaying in vivo new strategies, formulations and delivery systems targeted to the mevalonate pathway to inhibit local SMC response to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.", 
    "45": "We have previously demonstrated that the HMG-CoA inhibitor pravastatin is efficiently taken up by the liver via the 'multispecific anion transporter' in an active manner. To further examine the fate of pravastatin within the liver, its biliary excretion was studied in a single-pass liver perfusion system and isolated liver canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs) using normal (Sprague-Dawley rats; SDRs) and mutant Eisai hyperbilirubinaemic rats (EHBRs). In the liver perfusion experiments, the outflowing drug concentration reached a steady state at 30 min and the extraction ratio was approximately 0.7 in both rat strains. Both the steady state biliary excretion rate and bile flow rate of the EHBR group were 40% of those of SDRS. At steady state, the fraction of unchanged drug in bile was 25-34% in both groups. The concentration ratios of unbound drug in cytosol versus that in sinusoid and of that in bile versus that in cytosol were, respectively, 11 and 87 in SDRs, and 13 and 94 in EHBRs. After correction for the membrane potential (-40 mV in cytosol), the ratios became 49 and 19 in SDR and 58 and 21 in EHBRs, respectively. The finding that all of these values were much larger than unity suggested that active transport occurred from liver to bile, as well as from plasma to liver, in both rat strains. Furthermore, ATP-dependent uptake of pravastatin was clearly observed in CMVs prepared from EHBRs as well as SDRs, whereas the stimulation by ATP of DNP-SG transport in CMVs was observed only in SDRs. It was concluded that pravastatin is excreted into bile in high concentrations and a primary active transport mechanism which is maintained in EHBRs contributes to the biliary excretion of this drug.", 
    "46": "Pregnancy outcomes in women with inadvertent exposure to lovastatin and simvastatin during pregnancy have been examined based on reports submitted to the manufacturer as part of worldwide postmarketing surveillance. There were 134 reports of exposure during pregnancy in which pregnancy outcome was known. Among prospectively followed pregnancies with known outcome, the proportion of normal outcomes was 85%, congenital anomalies 4.0%, spontaneous abortions 8.0%, fetal deaths/stillbirths 1.0%, and miscellaneous adverse outcomes 2.0%. While the number of prospective reports available for evaluation were only sufficient to rule out a three- to fourfold increase in the overall frequency of congenital anomalies, these proportions do not exceed what would be expected in the general population. Based on findings from this interim evaluation, there is no relationship between exposure to therapeutic doses of these agents during pregnancy and the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes.", 
    "47": "The primary objective was to investigate the effective permeability and the hepatic extraction of fluvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, during a jejunal perfusion in humans. The secondary objective was to investigate the relationship between human jejunal effective permeability values and physicochemical properties for four different drugs.", 
    "48": "Nine healthy male volunteers were included in the study, which consisted of two sequential study parts. In the first part, the jejunal effective permeability of fluvastatin, antipyrine, metoprolol, and atenolol was assessed with use of the regional jejunal perfusion approach (150 minutes, 2.0 ml/min). After a washout period of at least 5 days, the same subjects received an intravenous infusion of fluvastatin (20 minutes, 2.0 mg). Plasma samples were taken in both parts of the study and were analyzed for the content of fluvastatin.", 
    "49": "The mean hepatic extraction of fluvastatin was 67% after the jejunal perfusion and 73% after the intravenous infusion. The half-life of fluvastatin was approximately 60 minutes after both administration routes. The jejunal effective permeability and the fraction absorbed both correlated (r2 = 0.968, p < 0.05; and r2 = 0.994, p < 0.05) with the partition coefficient (log D, pH 6.5) but not with the molecular size or the hydrogen bond number.", 
    "50": "Fluvastatin is extracted by the liver to a large extent (about 70%) and has a short half-life after both oral and intravenous administration. In this study, the human jejunal effective permeability and the fraction absorbed for these four drugs were better predicted by log D (pH 6.5) than both the molecular size and the hydrogen bond number.", 
    "51": "It was previously demonstrated that treatment of primary cultured rat hepatocytes with lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, induced the mRNAs for several cytochromes P450 (P450s), including CYP2B1/2, CYP3A1/2, and CYP4A. In this study, we have compared the effects of lovastatin with those of three additional HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin, pravastatin, and the structurally dissimilar drug fluvastatin) on P450 expression in primary cultured rat hepatocytes, and we have also characterized the effects of in vivo treatment with fluvastatin on P450 expression in rat liver. Treatment of cultured hepatocytes with lovastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin increased CYP2B1/2, CYP3A1/2, and CYP4A mRNA and immunoreactive protein levels over the dose range (3 x 10(-6) to 3 x 10(-5) M) required to increase the amount of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA. The increases in CYP2B1/2 levels produced by 3 x 10(-5) M fluvastatin treatment were larger than those produced by lovastatin or simvastatin treatment or by treatment with 10(-4) M phenobarbital. In contrast, treatment of cultured hepatocytes with 3 x 10(-5) M lovastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin increased CYP3A1/2 and CYP4A mRNA and immunoreactive protein to lower levels than those produced by treatment with 10(-5) M dexamethasone or 10(-4) M ciprofibrate. Treatment of cultured hepatocytes with pravastatin had little or no effect on the amount of any of the P450s examined, although this drug induced HMG-CoA reductase mRNA as effectively as did fluvastatin. Incubation of hepatocytes with 10(-4) M fluvastatin increased CYP1A1 mRNA to 67% of the level induced by treatment with 10(-5) M beta-naphthoflavone. Doses of 50 or 100 mg/ kg/day fluvastatin administered for 3 days to rats increased the hepatic levels of CYP2B1/2 and CYP4A mRNA and immunoreactive protein, although to much lower levels than those produced by treatment with phenobarbital or ciprofibrate, respectively. Treatment of rats with fluvastatin had no effect on hepatic levels of CYP3A1/2 mRNA or immunoreactive protein. However, treatment with 50 mg/kg/day fluvastatin induced CYP1A1 mRNA and protein. The effects of fluvastatin treatment on P450 expression seen in primary cultured rat hepatocytes thus largely recapitulated the effects seen in vivo. The differences in effects among the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors suggest that simple inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase cannot explain all of the effects of these drugs on P450 expression.", 
    "52": "1. The effects of fluvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on the vascular angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in hyperlipidaemic rabbits were compared with those of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor. 2. Rabbits were fed a 1.5% cholesterol containing diet or normal diet for 16 weeks and treated with either fluvastatin or enalapril in the diet at the respective doses of 2 and 10 mg kg-1 day-1. The total cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipid levels in serum were significantly increased in rabbits fed the high cholesterol diet. Treatment with fluvastatin but not enalapril resulted in a decrease in serum lipids. 3. The vascular ACE activities assessed via the cleavage rate from synthetic substrate in the aortic arches and upper thoracic aortae were increased by 8 to 10 times when the rabbits were made hyperlipidaemic. Fluvastatin as well as enalapril significantly lowered the tissue ACE in the aortae. 4. The ACE activities in serum did not alter in hyperlipidaemic rabbits either in the presence or absence of fluvastatin. The serum ACE activity was lowered by enalapril. 5. The lipid peroxide in serum as well as the plaque area in the thoracic aorta was significantly increased in the cholesterol diet-fed rabbits. Treatment with fluvastatin or enalapril reduced both serum lipid peroxide and plaque formation. The relaxant responses to acetylcoholine (ACh) were significantly suppressed in the cholesterol-fed rabbits. Treatment with fluvastatin or enalapril significantly reversed the suppression of ACh-induced relaxation. 6. It seems that the reduction of vascular ACE is not coupled to lipids and ACE activity in serum, but rather to lipid peroxidation. Thus, the decrease in vascular ACE activity by fluvastatin as well as the lipid-lowering effect may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis progression in the vasculature.", 
    "53": "The introduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors has provided an important new class of agents that reduce levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol more powerfully than any previously used drugs. Multiple clinical trials have shown a significant decrease in lipid values and cardiovascular events and a slowing of the progression of atherosclerosis in men and women of all ages. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause mortality as a result of reduced cardiovascular mortality. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be considered as first-line therapy for hypercholesterolemia in all patients with established atherosclerosis involving the coronary, carotid, or peripheral vessels.", 
    "54": "Atherosclerosis is related to serum lipids, whereas restenosis after coronary angioplasty is probably not, reflecting different pathophysiologies. Nonetheless, treatment of lipid disorders is appropriate after angioplasty.", 
    "55": "We have used specific inhibitors for farnesyltransferase (FTase) and geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase) I as well as combinations of lovastatin with geranylgeraniol (GGOH) or farnesol (FOH) to investigate the role of protein prenylation in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. NIH-3T3 cells treated with the highly specific FTase inhibitor FTI-277 had no effect on PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation or PDGF activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) at doses that completely inhibit FTase-dependent processing. In contrast, treatment of these cells with GGTase I inhibitor GGTI-298 strongly inhibited receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, and co-treatment with FTI-277 had no additional effect. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of GGTI-298 on PDGF activation of MAPK was only partial. Furthermore, although lovastatin, which inhibits both protein geranylgeranylation and protein farnesylation, blocked PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, co-treatment with GGOH, but not FOH, reversed the lovastatin block. In addition, although lovastatin was observed to block MAPK activation by PDGF, co-treatment with GGOH, but not FOH, restored its activation. Further investigations indicated that inhibition of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was not due to decreased expression of the receptor or to inhibition of GGTase II. Thus, these results demonstrate that PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation requires protein geranylgeranylation but not protein farnesylation and that the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the receptor are modulated by a protein that is a substrate for GGTase I.", 
    "56": "The objective of this study was to probe the molecular mechanisms underlying the increase in sensitivity of cells to bradykinin (BK) following expression of a transforming Ha-ras oncogene. We used native NIH3T3 fibroblast (3T3) cells and 3T3 cells transfected with a glucocorticoid sensitive oncogenic Ha-ras construct (DT cells). DT cells incubated in the presence of 1 microM dexamethasone (DEX) for 24 hr expressed a relatively high level of membrane-bound Ha-Ras protein, BK B2 receptor mRNA, and B2 receptor binding as determined by Western blotting with anti-Ha-Ras antibodies, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using B2 receptor-specific primers, and specific [3H]BK binding, respectively. BK also stimulated a significant B2 receptor-mediated increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in the cells both alone and in synergy with epidermal growth factor. In the absence of DEX, the DT cells expressed a considerably lower but yet clearly significant level of Ha-Ras. Under this condition, receptor mRNA and receptor binding remained maximally expressed. On the other hand, BK was unable to stimulate any increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. In contrast to DT cells, no Ha-Ras, receptor mRNA, receptor binding, or BK-stimulated, B2 receptor-mediated [3H]thymidine incorporation was detected in 3T3 cells (+/- DEX). However, BK stimulated a transient increase in the level of intracellular free Ca2+ in the 3T3 cells indicating that these cells express a small number of functional B2 receptors. In all, these results show that oncogenic Ha-Ras regulates the sensitivity of 3T3 cells to BK through at least two different mechanisms. One mechanism occurs at a relatively low level of Ha-Ras and involves an increase in B2 receptor mRNA and expressed B2 receptor levels, and another mechanism occurs at a relatively high level of Ha-Ras and involves an increase in B2 receptor-mediated mitogenic signaling.", 
    "57": "Treatment of hypercholesterolemia with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors has revolutionized medical intervention towards the prevention of coronary artery disease. There is a wide sprectrum of patients with diverse underlying clinical conditions that may benefit from treatment using these agents. These include patients with multiple risk factors, individuals following major vascular events, and those with special conditions that are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. The latter include patients with severe, dominantly inherited hypercholesterolemia, patients with major organ dysfunction such as chronic renal failure, and individuals after transplantation. Multimodality intervention includes behavior modification and mechanical as well as pharmacological treatment. It is aimed at several important targets: cholesterol reduction, control of hypertension and diabetes, improvement of myocardial contractility, reduction of infarct size, and control of hemostasis. Most of these patients require multiple drugs, which may interact at the pharmacodynamic (efficacy and safety) as well as pharmacokinetic levels. These potential interactions should be considered while planning and implementing preventive measures for an individual as well as for the community. The beneficial effects and the potential hazardous interactions between HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and other medications are presented and discussed using two models: heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and major organ transplantation. Although there is a partial overlap in the medications used for the treatment of these two conditions, some of them differ. The interaction between HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and other cholesterol-lowering agents, mainly fibrates, is discussed in the first model summarizing data from controlled clinical trials. The interaction with cyclosporin A is presented using the second model. A potential benefit of fluvastatin, as compared with other currently available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which may be related to its relatively short plasma half-life and low systemic exposure, is discussed.", 
    "58": "With the increasing knowledge of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, it appears that in the future the prevention of cardiovascular disease will involve not only risk factor correction, but also direct pharmacological control of processes occurring in the arterial wall. Among these, a pivotal role is played by smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation, which, together with lipid deposition, are prominent features of atherogenesis and restenosis after angioplasty. Mevalonate and other intermediates of cholesterol synthesis (isoprenoids) are essential for cell growth, hence drugs affecting this metabolic pathway are potential antiatherosclerotic agents. Recently, we provided in vitro and in vivo evidence that fluvastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin, but not pravastatin, decrease SMC migration and proliferation dose dependently, independently of their hypocholesterolemic properties. The in vitro inhibition of cell migration and proliferation induced by simvastatin and fluvastatin (70-90% decrease) was prevented completely by the addition of mevalonate, and partially prevented by farnesol and geranylgeraniol (80%), confirming the specific role of isoprenoid metabolites in regulating these cellular events, probably through prenylated protein(s). The in vivo antiproliferative activity of fluvastatin on neointimal hyperplasia in normocholesterolemic rabbits was also prevented fully by the local delivery of mevalonate, by means of an Alzet pump. Fluvastatin and simvastatin also inhibited cholesterol esterification and deposition induced by acetylated LDL in cultured macrophages. This effect was fully prevented by the addition of mevalonate or geranylgeraniol. Taken together, these results suggest that, beyond their effects on plasma lipids, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors exert a direct antiatherosclerotic effect on the arterial wall, probably through local inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis.", 
    "59": "Hypercholesterolemia is an important atherogenic risk factor in type II diabetes, and although coronary artery disease (CAD) is frequent in these patients, it is not known whether cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism differ in patients with (CAD+) and without CAD (CAD-). Our aim was to study cholesterol metabolism and lipoprotein kinetics in mildly hypercholesterolemic type II diabetic men with and without CAD under similar dietary conditions. Despite similar serum and lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and kinetics of total and dense LDL apo B, light and dense LDL particles were cholesterol-enriched only in CAD+ subjects. Apolipoprotein A-II level was lower in CAD+ than in CAD- subjects (27.1 +/- 0.7 versus 30.9 +/- 0.7 mg/dl, P < 0.05), HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I kinetics were similar in the two groups. Cholesterol absorption was significantly higher in the CAD+ versus CAD- subjects (27 +/- 2 versus 20 +/- 3%, P < 0.05). In multiple logistic stepwise regression analysis with CAD as the dependent variable, cholesterol absorption efficiency and serum plant sterol/cholesterol proportions were the only variables significantly associated with CAD. In conclusion, in mildly hypercholesterolemic type II diabetic patients, the only metabolic parameter differentiating CAD patients from non-CAD ones was significantly higher cholesterol absorption efficiency in the coronary patients, which could contribute to the finding of the atherogenic cholesterol-rich dense LDL subfraction in these patients. Thus, a treatment causing cholesterol malabsorption by sitostanol alone or in combination with statin could be beneficial in these patients.", 
    "60": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression is regulated by proteolysis of transcription factors, sterol regulatory element binding proteins. To investigate the involvement of proteasome in this regulatory process, the effect of lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibiton of microbial origin, was tested on LDL receptor expression on HepG2 cells. The addition of lactacystin to the cell culture increased the number of LDL receptors, indicating that proteasome plays a down-regulatory role in LDL receptor expression.", 
    "61": "Lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, inhibits the synthesis of mevalonic acid and is widely used as an anti-atherosclerotic drug. The macrophage scavenger receptor (SCR), a trimeric membrane glycoprotein, is postulated to play a key role in atheroma macrophage foam cell formation. HMG-CoA reductase is involved in the control of the synthesis of glycoproteins and farnesylated proteins, including ras proteins, which are involved in the transcriptional regulation of SCR gene expression. Accordingly, we examined whether lovastatin alters the gene expression of SCRs in THP-1 cell derived human macrophages. Lovastatin (5-15 microM) caused a significant dose-related reduction in steady state levels of type-I SCR mRNA in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-treated THP-1 cells. The addition of exogenous mevalonate (1 mM) completely restored the lovastatin-induced decrease of type-I SCR mRNA levels. While the addition of the isoprenoid end-product, isopentenyl adenine (50 microM), had little effect on the type-I SCR mRNA levels in lovastatin treated cells, the addition of isoprenoid farnesol (5 microM) largely restored the lovastatin-induced decrease of type-I SCR mRNA levels. Actinomycin D treatment showed that degradation rates of type-I SCR mRNA did not differ between the THP-1 derived cells with and without lovastatin treatment. Nuclear run-on assays showed that lovastatin markedly decreased the transcription of SCR gene in the cells. These results suggest that lovastatin inhibits the transcription of type-I SCR gene by affecting mevalonate metabolism, possibly through the farnesyl-pyrophosphate related end-product(s) in the THP-1-derived macrophages.", 
    "62": "This study was designed to determine the frequency of hyperlipidemia after orthotopic liver transplantation and whether treatment with a hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor was safe and efficacious. Cholesterol levels were assessed in 45 consecutive adult liver transplants (mean +/- SE). Four of 22 patients on cyclosporine (CsA) (18%) and three of 23 patients on FK506 (13%) had levels >225 mg/dl at 12 months (cholesterol levels for patients on CsA [total n=22]: pre-Tx = 140+/-11, 1 month = 183+/-36,3 months = 221+/-12, 6 months = 211+/-11, 12 months = 202+/-14 [P<0.01 vs. pre-Tx]; FK506 [total n=23]: Pre-Tx = 151+/-13, 1 month = 187+/-22, 3 months = 188+/-10, 6 months = 184+/-13, 12 months = 164+/-9 [P=0.02 vs. CsA]). A separate cohort of patients with stable graft function, cholesterol >225 mg/dl, and two additional risk factors for coronary artery disease were started on pravastatin. Ninety-eight patients were enrolled. Sixteen patients (16%) discontinued the drug because of subjective complaints. No episodes of rhabdomyolysis or hepatotoxicity occurred (cholesterol levels for patients on CsA [total n=65]: pretreatment = 251+/-7, 6 months = 220+/-7 [P=0.01 vs. pretreatment], 12 months = 224+/-8 [P=0.01 vs. pretreatment]; FK506 [total n=17]: pretreatment = 251+/-17, 6 months = 219+/-17, 12 months = 208+/-17 [P=0.08 vs. pretreatment]). Natural killer cells isolated from normal volunteers (n=14) exhibited 27+/-9% specific lysis. Patients on FK506 or cyclosporine-based immunosuppression alone (n=11) exhibited 20+/-4% specific lysis. Standard immunosuppression plus pravastatin (n=10) decreased lysis to 0.2+/-10% (P<0.02 vs. controls and standard immunosuppression). We conclude: (1) posttransplant hyperlipidemia occurs less frequently in liver transplant patients than in renal or cardiac transplants; (2) pravastatin is safe and efficacious for cholesterol reduction in liver transplant patients; and (3) pravastatin coadministered with standard immunosuppression reduces natural killer cell-specific lysis in these recipients.", 
    "63": "Many patients suffering from premature coronary artery disease report a family history for such events. A mutation in a particular gene, which confers susceptibility for atherosclerosis, will be found more frequently in individuals suffering from coronary atherosclerosis than in the general population. We have recently reported the identification of an Asp9 Asn substitution in the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) enzyme. We analyzed the impact of this mutation on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the effect of pravastatin in both carriers and noncarriers.", 
    "64": "All patients were enrolled in the quantitative coronary angiographic clinical trial REGRESS, which studied the impact of pravastatin therapy on coronary atherosclerosis. The Asp9 Asn mutation was identified in 38 of 819 (4.8%) patients. Carriers of the mutation more often had a positive family history of cardiovascular disease and lower HDL cholesterol levels than noncarriers. In the placebo group, carriers showed more progression of coronary atherosclerosis than noncarriers: mean reduction of the minimum obstruction diameter of -0.25 mm versus -0.12 mm (P = .029) and increase of percentage diameter stenosis of 6.4% versus 1.4% (P = .004). Moreover, the adjusted relative risk for a clinical event for carriers was calculated at 2.16 (95% CI, 1.09 to 4.29; P = .027). Although the lipid-lowering effect of pravastatin was attenuated in carriers, it appeared that these patients showed a response similar to noncarriers in terms of less progression of atherosclerosis and event-free survival.", 
    "65": "This study shows that heterozygosity for a mutation in the LPL gene, which causes only subtle changes in fasting plasma lipids, may promote the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and diminish clinical event-free survival.", 
    "66": "Identifying the conditions and kinetics of the induction of BRCA2 gene expression may implicate roles for the function of the tumor suppressor gene. In this study, expression of BRCA2 mRNA is shown to be regulated by the cell cycle and associated with proliferation in normal and tumor-derived breast epithelial cells. Cells arrested in G(0) or early G1 contained low levels of BRCA2 mRNA. After release into a proliferating state, cells produced maximum levels of BRCA2 mRNA in late G1 and the S-phase. Similar cell cycle control of BRCA2 was observed in fractions of exponentially growing cells isolated by centrifugal elutriation. Expression of BRCA2 was shown to be independent of bulk DNA synthesis. In addition, the kinetics of BRCA2 mRNA up-regulation appeared to be similar to those of BRCA1, suggesting that the two genes could be commonly controlled. These results imply that these two tumor suppressor genes are utilized during growth and may have a protective role in cellular proliferation.",

Examination of the lens showed no between-group differences, and no previously unrecognized adverse effects of the drug were observed.

    "71": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is subject to regulated degradation when cells are presented with an excess of sterols or mevalonate. In this report, we demonstrate the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in ER membranes prepared from cells which have been pretreated with mevalonate or sterols prior to membrane purification. Degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in membranes prepared from pretreated cells is more rapid than in membranes prepared from cells which have received no regulatory molecules. In vitro degradation is blocked by protease inhibitors previously shown to inhibit reductase degradation in vivo and is specific for intact HMG-CoA reductase. The lumenal contents of the ER membranes are dispensible for the regulated proteolysis and the proteases responsible for reductase degradation are stably associated with the ER membrane. Regulated proteolysis of HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited by lactacystin, a newly defined inhibitor of the multicatalytic protease, the proteasome, and in vitro degradation of reductase correlates with the presence of proteasome subunits in purified ER membranes. The ubiquitin system for protein degradation, which has recently been shown to be required for the degradation of several ER membrane proteins, is not required for the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Finally, we conclude that the regulated proteolysis of HMG-CoA reductase in response to regulatory molecules such as mevalonate or sterols is mediated by increased susceptibility of the reductase to ER proteases, rather than the induction of a new proteolytic activity.",

Coronary bypass surgery was needed in 7.5 percent of the patients in the pravastatin group and 10 percent of those in the placebo group, a 26 percent reduction (P=0.005), and coronary angioplasty was needed in 8.3 percent of the pravastatin group and 10.5 percent of the placebo group, a 23 percent reduction (P=0.01). The frequency of stroke was reduced by 31 percent (P=0.03). There were no significant differences in overall mortality or mortality from noncardiovascular causes.

Thirty mice each in 4 groups received an intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg DMH/kg body weight once weekly for 10 weeks, and were given drinking water dissolved Pr at the concentration of 10 ppm, 5 ppm, or 0 ppm (control) throughout the experiment. The incidence of colon tumors examined at week 35 was significantly lower in the Pr-treated groups than the control group: 20%. 21% and 23% vs. 55%. However, the tumor multiplicity/tumor-bearing animal was increased in the Pr-treated groups compared to the control group. Of all the tumors, 66 were adenocarcinomas in the distal colon and 5 were squamous cell carcinomas at the anus. The Pr treatment showed no hypocholesterolemic effect but did significant decrease of colonic mucosal cholesterol. The results seems to suggest that a small dose of Pr may reduce the incidence of colon cancers, perhaps being related, at least in part, to modulation of cholesterol synthesis in situ at the colonic mucosa.", 
    "77": "1. Recent outcome trials suggest that lipid-lowering with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors is justifiable on risk-benefit grounds in subjects with serum cholesterol > 5.5 mmol/l who have coronary heart disease, other forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease, or who are free of vascular disease but have a risk of major coronary events > or = 1.5% per year. Choice of an appropriate treatment policy will require (i) knowledge of the proportion of the population who will need treatment for secondary prevention, and (ii) targeting of treatment for primary prevention at a specified absolute risk of coronary heart disease events. Selection of an appropriate coronary heart disease risk for primary prevention requires consideration of the number needed to be treated to prevent one coronary heart disease event, the proportion of the population requiring treatment, the cost-effectiveness of treatment and the total cost of treatment. 2. In a random stratified sample of subjects aged 35-69 years from the Health Survey for England 1993 we first examined the prevalence of subjects with cardiovascular disease and serum cholesterol > 5.5 mmol/l who may be candidates for secondary prevention. In those free of cardiovascular disease we then examined the prevalence of subjects with serum cholesterol > 5.5 mmol/l who had three different levels of coronary heart disease risk: coronary heart disease event rates of 4.5% per year, 3.0% per year and 1.5% per year. These subjects may be candidates for primary prevention depending on the treatment policy selected. 3. For secondary prevention, 4.8% (95% confidence interval 4.3-5.3) of the U.K. population aged 35-69 years might be candidates for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor treatment, comprising 2.4% (2.0 to 2.7) with a history of myocardial infarction, 1.9% (1.6 to 2.2) with angina and 0.5% (0.3-0.7) with a history of stroke--all with total cholesterol > 5.5 mmol/l. The prevalence of these diagnoses with total cholesterol > 5.5 mmol/l increased with age, from 1.5% at age 35-39 years to 16.2% at age 65-69 years in men, and from 0.2% at age 35-39 years to 10.0% at age 65-69 years in women. Approximately 13 people would need treatment for 5 years to prevent one coronary event, at a cost of 36,000 pounds per event prevented. The number needing treatment for secondary prevention would increase substantially if treatment was extended to patients above 70 years of age or to those with serum cholesterol < or = 5.5 mmol/l. 4. Primary prevention aimed at a coronary event risk of 4.5% per year would lead to treatment of only 0.3% (0.2-0.4) of those aged 35-69 years, and those treated would be predominantly older men with additional risk factors for coronary heart disease. The number needed to be treated and cost per coronary event prevented would be similar to those for secondary prevention. 5. Primary prevention targeted at subjects with a coronary event rate of 3.0% per year would entail treating 3.4% (3.0-3.9) of all those aged 35-69 years. At this level of risk, 20 people would need treatment for 5 years to prevent one coronary event, at a cost of 55,000 pounds per event prevented. 6. Primary prevention aimed at a coronary event rate of 1.5% per year would entail treating 19.6% (18.7-20.6) of all subjects aged 35-69 years, and about 80% of men aged 60-69 years for primary or secondary prevention. At this level of risk, 40 people would need treatment for 5 years to prevent one event, at a cost of 111,000 pounds per event saved. 7. Guidelines for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor treatment should take into account the considerable workload and financial resources needed to implement secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, the accepted first priority. For primary prevention they need to consider the number needed to be treated to prevent one event, the number of subjects needing treatment, the cost-effectiveness of treatment and", 
    "78": "We investigated the effects of simvastatin on the number and composition of apoproteinB (apoB)-containing lipoproteins in thirteen patients with hypercholesterolemia type IIa or IIb by measuring apoB by a highly sensitive latex method. Patients received simvastatin 5-10 mg (7.7 +/- 0.7 mg, mean +/- SEM) daily for 83-218 days (131 +/- 13 days). In both types of patients, treatment with simvastatin significantly reduced plasma cholesterol levels (mean +/- SEM mg/dl: in type IIa from 234.4 +/- 5.4 to 171.4 +/- 7.8, in type IIb from 242.4 +/- 11.6 to 178.8 +/- 9.6), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (from 122.6 +/- 5.2 to 68.5 +/- 4.6, and from 115.6 +/- 14.0 to 70.4 +/- 11.6 in the two types, respectively) and LDL apoB levels (from 94.5 +/- 6.6 to 60.6 +/- 7.0, and from 85.0 +/- 8.4 to 56.6 +/- 6.2, respectively). There was no significant change in cholesterol, triglyceride (TG) or apoB in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol did not change in this study. With respect to lipoprotein composition, the ratio of either cholesterol or TG to apoB in VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and LDL did not change significantly, but that of TG to apoB in the IDL fraction increased in type IIa. Simvastatin promotes more effective reduction in cholesterol and apoB in LDL than in VLDL, probably by increasing the hepatic LDL receptor which preferentially binds LDL.", 
    "79": "Eighteen patients with familial hypercholesterolemia treated with lovastatin (40 mg/day) for three months were studied to find out whether the drug induces modifications in the lipid composition of the erythrocyte membrane and whether these induce changes in the rheological behaviour of the red blood cell. Our results show that the changes observed in plasma lipids correlate with a significant decrease in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of the red blood cell membrane. These changes in the lipid composition of the cell are statistically related to a decrease in the erythrocyte aggregability and an improvement in blood filterability probably due to an increase in the red blood cell deformability.", 
    "80": "Urinary excretion of mevalonic acid was investigated as an indicator of cholesterol synthesis. In normolipemic volunteers, excretion of mevalonic acid averaged 3.51 +/- 0.59 (SD) micrograms/kg x day1; (n = 24) and was not different from patients with hypercholesterolemia (3.30 +/- 0.92 micrograms/kg x day1; n = 24). In patients with cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis, the excretion was significantly higher (8.55 +/- 1.92 micrograms/kg x day1; n = 6, P < 0.001) but comparable to volunteers treated with cholestyramine (6.69 +/- 2.6 micrograms/kg x day1; n = 5). A significant correlation was found between 24-h excretion of mevalonic acid and cholesterol synthesis (r = 0.835; n = 35; P < 0.001). The coefficient of variation of excretion of mevalonic acid during 3 consecutive days was small (9.8%; n = 7). However, urinary output of mevalonic acid was significantly higher during the night (164 +/- 14 micrograms/12-h) than during the day (129 +/- 9 micrograms/12-h; n = 11; P < 0.05). In patients treated with simvastatin (40 mg/day) for 6 weeks, the ratio of mevalonic acid to creatinine in a morning urine sample decreased significantly compared to pretreatment values (110 +/- 25 micrograms/g vs. 66 +/- 25 micrograms/g; P < 0.001). Furthermore, the ratio of mevalonic acid to creatinine in a morning urine sample correlated with the ratio from the 24-h collection period (r = 0.714; n = 34; P < 0.001). The results indicate that the analysis of urinary mevalonic acid, either in 24-h collection or in a single morning sample, is an attractive method for evaluation of long and very short term changes of the rates of cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "81": "Of 17 patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) and nephrotic syndrome, 9 were allocated to treatment with simvastatin (an HMG CoA-reductase inhibitor) and low cholesterol diet, and 8 to diet alone. At entry, the treatment and control groups did not differ in mean serum creatinines, chromium-labelled EDTA clearances, urinary protein/creatinine ratios, serum albumins, and lipid profiles. The mean follow up period (+/- SEM) in the treated group was 19.3 (+/- 4.4) months compared with 16.6 (+/- 5.9) months in the control group. At the end of the trial the fall in chromium-labelled EDTA clearances was similar (-1.27 versus -1.28 mls/min/months/1.73 m2) in the treatment and control groups respectively. The mean (+/- SEM) total and LDL-cholesterol had gone from 10.5 (+/- 0.94) and 8.02 (+/- 1) mmol/l to 5.2 (+/- 0.49) and 3.47 (+/- 0.44) respectively in the treated patients.

There was little change in total and LDL-cholesterol; albumin and urinary protein/creatinine ratio in the control group. This study supports the observation that lowering serum cholesterol in the nephrotic syndrome reduces proteinuria and increases serum albumin levels. No difference in the rate of decline in renal function could be demonstrated.", 
    "82": "1. It has been suggested that lipophilic HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, like lovastatin and simvastatin, may cause sleep disturbance. 2. Six hundred and twenty-one patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease were randomized in a single centre to receive 40 mg daily simvastatin, 20 mg daily simvastatin or matching placebo. To assess the effects of prolonged use of simvastatin on nocturnal sleep quality and duration, a sleep questionnaire was administered to 567 patients (95% of 595 survivors) at an average of 88 weeks (range: 44-129 weeks) after randomization. 3. The main outcome measures were sleep-related problems and use of sleep-enhancing medications reported during routine study follow-up visits, and responses to the sleep questionnaire about changes in sleep duration and about various sleep events during the preceding month. 4. No differences were observed between the treatment groups in the frequency of sleep-related problems reported, in the proportion of follow-up visits at which such problems were reported, or in the use of sleep-enhancing medications. The numbers who stopped study treatment were similar in the different treatment groups, and no patient stopped principally because of insomnia. In response to the sleep questionnaire, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups in reports of various sleep events during the preceding month, except that slightly fewer patients allocated simvastatin reported waking often. No differences in sleep duration were observed. 5. This placebo-controlled trial does not indicate any adverse effects of prolonged treatment with simvastatin on systematically sought measures of sleep disturbance.", 
    "83": "Of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, the hydrophilic pravastatin has been shown to exhibit relatively specific inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. As one of the reasons for this relatively specific pharmacological activity, we demonstrated that the tissue distribution of pravastatin is limited because of its high hydrophilicity, while hepatic uptake by active transport takes place at the liver surface via a multispecific anion transporter (M. Yamazaki et al., Am. J. Physiol., 264, G36-44, 1993). In this study, we examined the hepatic elimination of pravastatin at steady-state.",

    "85": "The hepatic availability at steady-state exhibited a clear increase on increasing the infusion rate of pravastatin. The total hepatic elimination rate at steady-state exhibited Michaelis-Menten type saturation with the drug concentration in the capillary defined by typical mathematical models (i.e., well-stirred, parallel-tube and dispersion models), K(m) and Vmax values being comparable with those obtained from analysis of the initial uptake velocity using in vitro isolated hepatocytes.", 
    "86": "These results indicate that overall hepatic intrinsic clearance of pravastatin at steady-state is regulated by the uptake process, followed by rapid metabolism and/or biliary excretion with minimal efflux to the circulating blood.", 
    "87": "We have previously demonstrated that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin is efficiently taken up by the liver via the 'multispecific anion transporter' in an active manner. To further examine the fate of pravastatin within the liver, its biliary excretion was studied in a single-pass liver perfusion system and isolated liver canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs) using normal (Sprague-Dawley rats; SDRs) and mutant Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBRs). In the liver perfusion experiments, the outflowing drug concentration reached a steady state at 30 min and the extraction ratio was approximately 0.7 in both rat strains. Both the steady-state biliary excretion rate and bile flow rate of the EHBR group were 40% those of SDRs. At steady state, the fraction of unchanged drug in bile was 25-34% in both groups. The concentration ratios of unbound drug in cytosol versus that in sinusoid and in bile versus cytosol were, respectively, 11 and 87 in SDRs, and 13 and 94 in EHBRs. After correction for membrane potential (-40 mV in cytosol), the ratios became 49 and 19 in SDRs and 58 and 21 in EHBRs, respectively. The finding that all of these values were much larger than unity suggested that active transport occurred from liver to bile, as well as from plasma to liver, in both rat strains. Furthermore, ATP-dependent uptake of pravastatin was clearly observed in CMVs prepared from EHBRs as well as SDRs, whereas the stimulation by ATP of DNP-SG transport in CMV was observed only in SDRs. It was concluded that pravastatin is excreted into bile in high concentrations and a primary active transport mechanism which is maintained in EHBRs contributes to the biliary excretion of this drug.", 
    "88": "Pharmacological treatment of hyperlipidemia may be associated with deterioration of glucose tolerance. We randomized 20 nonobese patients with primary familial hypercholesterolemia (serum total cholesterol 7.8 +/- 0.4 mM, triglycerides 1.4 +/- 0.2 mM) to an isocaloric, reduced fat (< 30%) low-cholesterol (200 mg/day) diet with placebo or pravastatin (40 mg/day). Oral glucose tolerance, endogenous insulin response to glucose, insulin sensitivity (determined by the euglycemic insulin clamp technique), hepatic glucose production (by the tritiated glucose technique), and substrate utilization (by indirect calorimetry) were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. Ten normocholesterolemic healthy subjects, matched to the patients by age, sex, and body weight, served as the control group. Diet alone (with no change in body weight) was associated with a significant 15% decrease in both serum low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides (p < 0.001 for both), and a slight decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentrations, paralleled by reductions in Apo B, C2, C3, and E levels (p < 0.05 or less). The addition of pravastatin led to a significantly larger reduction in LDL-cholesterol (30%, p < 0.05) and an 8% increase (p < 0.02) in total HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Accordingly, the ratio of LDL:HDL cholesterol (which was 60% higher than in controls at baseline) remained unchanged in the placebo-diet group whereas it was restored to normal in the pravastatin-diet group. Glucose tolerance, insulin response, insulin-induced inhibition of hepatic glucose production and lipolysis, and insulin-mediated glucose uptake and oxidation were all slightly but not significantly improved after treatment, with no significant differences between pravastatin and placebo. In nonobese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, pravastatin treatment in combination with an isocaloric, reduced-fat diet leads to a marked reduction in LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides levels and a normalization of the LDL:HDL ratio without affecting glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity.", 
    "89": "Triglycerides (TGs), cholesteryl esters (CEs), cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine have been independently proposed as playing regulatory roles in apoB-100 secretion; the results depended on the cellular model used. In this study, we reinvestigate the role of lipids in apoB-100 production in HepG2 cells and in particular, we clarify the respective roles of intracellular mass and the biosynthesis of lipids in the regulation of apoB-100 production. In a first set of experiments, the pool size of cholesterol, CEs, and TGs was modulated by a 3-day treatment with either lipid precursors or inhibitors of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis. We used simvastatin (a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor), 58-035 (an acyl coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor), 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furancarboxylic acid (TOFA, an inhibitor of fatty acid synthesis), and oleic acid. The secretion rate of apoB-100 was not affected by the large modulation of lipid mass induced by these various pre-treatments. In a second set of experiments, the same lipid modulators were added during a 4-hour labeling period. Simvastatin and 58-035 inhibited cholesterol and CE synthesis without affecting apoB-100 secretion. By contrast, treatment of HepG2 cells with TOFA resulted in the inhibition of TG synthesis and apoB-100 secretion. This effect was highly specific for apoB-100 and was reversed by adding oleic acid, which stimulated both TG synthesis and apoB-100 secretion. Moreover, a combination of oleic acid and 58-035 inhibited CE biosynthesis and increased both TG synthesis and apoB-100 secretion. These results show that in HepG2 cells TG biosynthesis regulates apoB-100 secretion, whereas the rate of cholesterol or CE biosynthesis has no effect.",

Group A included 12 patients treated with simvastatin 10 mg bid; group B included 10 patients treated with placebo. All patients underwent a treadmill electrocardiography (ECG) test; total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, plasma, and blood viscosity were measured. All tests were repeated after 4 and 12 weeks. For 18 of the same patients (11 taking simvastatin, 7 receiving placebo), forearm strain-gouge plethysmography was performed at baseline and after 4 weeks, both at rest and during reactive hyperemia. At 4 and 12 weeks, group A showed a significant reduction in total cholesterol (p <0.05) and LDL (p <0.05), with unchanged HDL, triglycerides, blood, and plasma viscosity. Effort was unmodified, ST-segment depression at peak effort and ischemic threshold were significantly improved after 4 and 12 weeks (all p <0.05) with unchanged heart rate x systolic blood pressure product. A significant increase in the excess flow response to reactive hyperemia was detected in group A (p <0.03); group B showed no changes in hematochemical and ergometric parameters. These data suggest that cholesterol-lowering treatment is associated with an improvement in myocardial effort ischemia; this might be explained by a more pronounced increase of coronary blood flow and capacity of vasodilation in response to effort.", 
    "91": "We undertook this prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose (15 mg) pravastatin in elderly hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects with concurrent antihypertensive treatment and to determine whether fasting hyperinsulinemia could also be improved. At three hypertension and lipid clinics of two medical centers, 96 elderly (49 women, 47 men) ambulatory subjects were randomized to active treatment or placebo for 12 months after a 3-month single-blind lead-in period. Hypertensive subjects with plasma total cholesterol levels of at least 6.47 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) and triglyceride levels less than 3.39 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) were treated with 15 mg pravastatin for 12 months after receiving 3 months of the American Heart Association step I diet. Lipid, glucose, and fasting insulin levels were measured; clinical laboratory tests included liver function and creatine kinase determinations. After 12 months of pravastatin therapy, plasma total cholesterol concentration decreased by 25.1% (from a mean of 7.29 to 5.47 mmol/L, P < .05), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 30.2% (from 5.27 to 3.68 mmol/L, P < .05), and triglycerides decreased by 10.7% (from 1.68 to 1.50 mmol/L, P < .05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 9.2% (from 1.20 to 1.31 mmol/L, P < .05). Fasting insulin levels decreased from 89.0 to 61.5 pmol/L (P < .05). All of these changes were greater (P < .05) than any tendency toward change in the placebo group. Adverse events and clinical laboratory abnormalities were generally mild and transient in both placebo and pravastatin groups. Study drugs were withdrawn from one subject in each group with asymptomatic creatine kinase elevations. We conclude that low-dose pravastatin was effective and safe in the treatment of hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects on concurrent antihypertensive therapy. It also improved fasting hyperinsulinemia despite the use of beta-blockers and diuretics in these hypertensive subjects.",

Forty-eight-hour ambulatory ECGs with continuous ST-segment analysis were performed in 768 male patients with stable angina pectoris, documented coronary artery disease, and serum cholesterol between 4 and 8 mmol/L (155 and 310 mg/dL). During the trial, patients received routine antianginal treatment. In the patients randomized to pravastatin, transient myocardial ischemia was present at baseline in 28% and after treatment in 19%; in the placebo group, it was found in 20% and 23% of the patients, respectively (P = .021 for change in percentage between two treatment groups; odds ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.93). Ischemic episodes decreased by 1.23 +/- 0.25 (SEM) episode with pravastatin and by 0.53 +/- 0.25 episode with placebo (P = .047). Under pravastatin, the duration of ischemia decreased from 80 +/- 12 minutes to 42 +/- 10 minutes (P = .017) and with placebo, from 60 +/- 13 minutes to 51 +/- 9 minutes (P = .56).

Revascularization procedures are the only effective approach to improving prognosis associated with coronary artery disease. In contrast, on the basis of the new paradigm, the nature of the plaque determines the risk of acute cardiovascular events. Dangerous plaques have a lipid-rich core with surrounding inflammation and a thin friable overlying fibrous cap, but they usually appear innocuous on angiography. Effective risk factor modification stabilizes the dangerous plaques and is associated with prompt improvement in endothelial dysfunction and a substantial decrease in the risk of acute cardiovascular events and death.", 
    "96": "Sterol biosynthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an energy-expensive, aerobic process, requiring heme and molecular oxygen. Heme, also synthesized exclusively during aerobic growth, not only acts as an enzymatic cofactor but also is directly and indirectly responsible for the transcriptional control of several yeast genes. Because of their biosynthetic similarities, we hypothesized that ergosterol, like heme, may have a regulatory function. Sterols are known to play a structural role in membrane integrity, but regulatory roles have not been characterized. To test possible regulatory roles of sterol, the promoter for the ERG3 gene, encoding the sterol C-5 desaturase, was fused to the bacterial lacZ reporter gene. This construct was placed in strains making aberrant sterols, and the effect of altered sterol composition on gene expression was monitored by beta-galactosidase activity. The absence of ergosterol resulted in a 35-fold increase in the expression of ERG3 as measured by beta-galactosidase activity. The level of ERG3 mRNA was increased as much as ninefold in erg mutant strains or wild-type strains inhibited in ergosterol biosynthesis by antifungal agents. The observed regulatory effects of ergosterol on ERG3 are specific for ergosterol, as several ergosterol derivatives failed to elicit the same controlling effect. These results demonstrate for the first time that ergosterol exerts a regulatory effect on gene transcription in S. cerevisiae.", 
    "97": "More than $100 billion is spent in the United States each year on cardiovascular disease, primarily for hospitalizations and revascularization procedures. This is more than for any other disease state. As the clinical practice of medicine shifts from the paradigm of private practice to the managed care environment, cost-effectiveness is becoming increasingly important. A primary measure in analyzing cost-effectiveness is the cost-effectiveness ratio, or the dollar cost per unit of improvement for a given expenditure. This measure allows healthcare planners to compare completely different interventions. With approximately 52 million adult U.S. citizens having elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, lipid-lowering therapy---with diet or 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors---is an important consideration for primary care physicians and managed care providers. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III indicates that 75-88% of adults who have coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors or CAD require only a moderate (20--30%) reduction in LDL cholesterol levels to reach National Cholesterol Education Program goals. The clinical literature shows that all 4 of the currently available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can provide appropriate, moderate LDL cholesterol reductions within their recommended dosage ranges. For the majority of patients who need a 20--30% reduction in LDL cholesterol, fluvastatin 20 or 40 mg once daily provides the most cost-effective HMG-CoA therapy, expressed as cost of therapy per 1% LDL cholesterol reduction. For patients who need a >30% LDL cholesterol reduction, a high-dose HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (e.g., simvastatin 20 or 40 mg/day) or a combination of a lower-dose HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and a bile acid resin is the preferred initial therapy. Although a true cost-effectiveness analysis would incorporate morbidity and mortality data from clinical trials, analysis using intermediate endpoints, such as LDL cholesterol reduction, suggests that fluvastatin is the preferred initial HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for the treatment of moderate hyperlipidemia.", 
    "98": "The available clinical data for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors demonstrate their efficacy and safety in treating hypercholesterolemia and improving long-term morbidity and mortality related to coronary artery disease. Comparative studies among agents in this class support the general perception that, at the most commonly prescribed doses, all these drugs reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by about 20-30%. The primary measure of efficacy in the current study was the percentage of patients achieving goal levels for LDL cholesterol of < 160 mg/dL, as proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). This study compares the most widely prescribed agent in this class, lovastatin, with the newest agent, fluvastatin. Patients enrolled had previously been satisfactorily treated with lovastatin 20 mg every evening. Following a placebo washout period, patients were randomized to receive lovastatin 20 mg with the evening meal (69 patients) or fluvastatin 20 mg at bedtime (68 patients) for 4 weeks of open-label therapy. In a second 4-week period, patients on lovastatin continued on the initial dosage while patients receiving fluvastatin had their daily dosage increased to 40 mg at bedtime to evaluate the range of efficacy from 20-40 mg/day. In both treatment arms, the majority of patients achieved the goal lipid level. Approximately 85% of patients on fluvastatin 20 mg and 90% of patients on lovastatin 20 mg achieved the goal within 4 weeks. This small difference was not statistically significant. Increasing the dosage to 40 mg at bedtime in the fluvastatin arm produced goal LDL cholesterol levels in about 90% of patients. Both agents were well tolerated; no patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events.", 
    "99": "Fluvastatin, the newest member of the class of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, is structurally different from the fungal metabolites (lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin) and is wholly synthetic. Fluvastatin has a distinct biopharmaceutical profile, including a short systemic exposure time (half-life of 1.2 hours) and virtually no active circulating metabolites. Fluvastatin is targeted to the liver, where it is rapidly metabolized; 98% of fluvastatin is protein bound. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that fluvastatin at daily dosages of 20-40 mg produces significant decreases from baseline in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol on the order of 22-31% in patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (mean baseline LDL cholesterol 227 mg/dL) and decreases of 19-25% in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (mean baseline LDL cholesterol 270 mg/dL). Interim results of a titrate-to-goal, 20-week study in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol >= 160 mg/dL and triglycerides <= 350 mg/dL) demonstrate that fluvastatin, 20 mg/day, lowers LDL cholesterol by 21% within 6 weeks. Long-term results indicate that the lipid-lowering effects of fluvastatin are sustained for 96 weeks. Further, 1 study has shown that the combination of low-dose fluvastatin plus niacin decreased LDL cholesterol levels 40% without untoward adverse events, suggesting that this combination is effective and safe for patients needing intensive lipid-lowering therapy. Asymptomatic, reversible increases in hepatic transaminase levels occur in fluvastatin-treated patients at a frequency comparable to that reported for other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The 20-30% reduction in LDL cholesterol required by the majority of patients with hypercholesterolemia can be achieved with fluvastatin at 20 or 40 mg/day as well as with the other available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors at their most commonly prescribed doses. Fluvastatin, priced 40% lower than other statins, provides the most cost-effective means of safely achieving goal LDL cholesterol levels in these patients.", 
    "100": "The authors conducted a cross-sectional study including 707 patients with chronic ischaemic heart disease or obstructive peripheral atherosclerotic disease. The patients were monitored by 31 general practitioners in different parts of Norway, from October 1994 to April 1995. 67% of the patients were male and 33% were female. 28% were smokers. In this study the majority of the patients were being adequately treated for hypertension, and the prevalence of antithrombotic treatment with either warfarin or acetylsalicylic acid was comparable with the results from recent intervention trials, for instance the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S). More than 90% of the patients had levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol which, based on today's international consensus, implied giving dietary advice and treatment with statin-type drugs in order to increase survival and reduce morbidity once atherosclerotic disease has been diagnosed. In this study less than 20% received statins, and only a minority of those treated had reached the established goals for treatment. Based on this study we recommend that much stronger emphasis is placed on serum-cholesterol level reduction in patients with established atherosclerotic disease, both by specialists and in primary health care.", 
    "101": "This study concerns 169 women whose exposure to simvastatin (Zocor or Lodales) during pregnancy led to a request for information from pharmaceutical firms. The evolution of pregnancies (among which 2 were twins) was documented in 125 women: 66 women gave birth to normal babies, 40 requested and induced abortion, 12 spontaneous abortions occurred, and the 9 other known pregnancy issues were 4 premature newborns, 3 newborns with malformations and 2 fetal deaths. Apart from the 5 retrospective files concerning 5 spontaneous abortions, all the files were analysed prospectively. Except for induced abortions, regarding the prospective files, the pregnancy outcome was comparable with that of a general population.", 
    "102": "Experimental and clinical data suggest that activation of the LDL receptors by the use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, in the presence of normal plasma cholesterol levels, may result in a reduction of Lp(a) concentrations. This hypothesis has been tested in an open study on seven subjects with normal cholesterolemia but marked elevations of Lp(a) levels, three of whom received pravastatin and four simvastatin at standard therapeutic doses. While the two drugs caused the expected reduction of plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels, no significant changes in Lp(a) were noted. This study contradicts a prior clinical finding and suggests that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors are unlikely to reduce plasma Lp(a) levels even in the absence of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "103": "To compare the effects of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on DNA synthesis in synchronized and proliferative rat glomerular mesangial cells (MCs), growth-arrested and proliferative MCs were exposed to medium containing 20% or 10% FBS, respectively, to induce mitogenesis. Different doses of pravastatin (10(-3)-10(-9) M) were added for 48 h. DNA synthesis was assessed by Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Pravastatin caused a significant (P < 0.05) dose-dependent reduction in BrdU incorporation in both serum-stimulated synchronized and proliferative MCs, but higher doses are required in the latter.",

    "105": "Ten hypercholesterolemic subjects with coronary artery disease were selected for a pilot study. Lipid and lipoprotein analysis and Thallium-201 SPECT were performed before and after 16 weeks of treatment with 40 mg of simvastatin QD. SPECT images were qualitatively analyzed in 8 myocardial segments using a 4 point scoring system. Quantitative evaluation was performed in 13 segments. The myocardial region with the maximal mean counts per pixel on the stress study was considered the reference region. TI201 activity in all other myocardial regions was expressed as a percentage of the activity in the reference region.", 
    "106": "Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced by 28.4% and 37.1% with treatment. Global myocardial perfusion was increased in all patients. Qualitative analysis demonstrated that cholesterol lowering improved myocardial perfusion during dipyridamole stress. Quantitative analysis showed an increased global perfusion during stress (41.8% vs 54.6%; p < 0.0001), due to increased perfusion of previous ischemic segments (32.4% vs 49.4%; p < 0.0001) but without changes in previous normally perfused segments (71.5% vs 71.3%).",

    "108": "METHODS OF CURRENT TRIALS: Several ongoing trials are investigating the anti-atherosclerotic effects of antihypertensive drugs in hypertensive patients. Changes in carotid intimal-medial thicknesses and atherosclerotic plaques are being explored by a sensitive quantitative B-mode ultrasound technique. MULTICENTER ISRADIPINE/DIURETIC ATHEROSCLEROSIS STUDY (MIDAS): The results from this pioneering study indicated a slower progression, at least in the first 6 months, of carotid plaques in isradipine-treated patients than in diuretic-treated patients. MIDAS has been particularly valuable in giving information on the rate of growth of intimal-medial thickness in hypertensive patients and on the best end-point to use in carotid ultrasound trials. EUROPEAN LACIDIPINE STUDY ON ATHEROSCLEROSIS (ELSA) AND VERAPAMIL IN HYPERTENSION AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS STUDY (VHAS): Baseline data from these two ongoing studies have provided evidence of the very high prevalence of carotid lesions among hypertensive patients: the prevalence of plaques (defined as a carotid intimal-medial thickness of > or = 1.3 mm) was 83% in ELSA, while in VHAS, in which plaques were defined as an intimal-medial thickness of > 1.5 mm), the plaque prevalence was 37%. These observations emphasize the importance of evaluating the atherosclerotic action of antihypertensive agents. PLAQUE HYPERTENSION LIPID-LOWERING ITALIAN STUDY (PHYLLIS): This trial is using a factorial design to explore the anti-atherosclerotic action of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (fosinopril) versus a diuretic, and also intends to evaluate the possible benefits of associating antihypertensive therapy with a statin to induce lipid-lowering to prevent the progression of carotid atherosclerosis.", 
    "109": "This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked, parallel-group trial assessed the serum cholesterol-lowering effects of atorvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase inhibitor, over 26 weeks in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Thirty-nine patients from four centers in the United States were originally randomized to one of two treatment groups and received either atorvastatin 10 mg (20 patients) or placebo (19 patients) once daily. Atorvastatin rapidly and significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and apolipoprotein B levels. LDL-C was reduced 35% with atorvastatin 10 mg compared with a 0% increase in LDL-C in the placebo group. Atorvastatin significantly reduced triglyceride levels, with improvements occurring over time. At 26 weeks, triglyceride levels were reduced by 21% with atorvastatin treatment compared with a 14% increase with placebo. The drug was well tolerated and no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were detected.", 
    "110": "We conducted a multicenter prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to test whether pravastatin, a hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, can decrease restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Pravastatin 10 mg twice daily was begun at least 10 days prior to elective PTCA in patients with total cholesterol less than 280 mg/dl. The end-point was a between-group comparison of the frequency of restenosis defined as a more than 50% loss of the initial gain in diameter stenosis at the PTCA site at 3 months during follow-up by automated quantitative coronary arteriography. Of 207 patients randomly assigned to study groups, 139 patients underwent PTCA; 133 procedures were successful, and 124 patients underwent follow-up angiography at 3 months, and 179 lesions (85 pravastatin, 94 placebo) in 124 patients (62 pravastatin, 62 placebo) were analyzed. The two groups were comparable for baseline characteristics. Total cholesterol decreased by 19.6% in the pravastatin group (p < 0.001) but not in the placebo group. Although the restenosis rate was not different in the two groups (29.4% in pravastatin vs. 39.4% in placebo, p = 0.215) as a whole, it was reduced to about one fifth (8.8%) in the pravastatin group compared with 44.8% in the placebo group (p = 0.0011) when the comparison was restricted to high grade lesions (> or = 75% diameter stenosis, 34 lesions in pravastatin, 29 lesions in placebo). Pravastatin thus reduces restenosis after PTCA of high grade lesions.", 
    "111": "We examined and compared the effects of probucol and pravastatin on the regression of xanthelasma. Thirty-six cases treated by probucol and 18 cases by pravastatin were evaluated for 12 months. Thirteen of the 36 cases treated with probucol showed regression of xanthelasma. However, one of the 18 cases treated with pravastatin showed regression. These data were statistically significantly. The average total cholesterol value in both groups decreased during drug therapy. However, the average of HDL-cholesterol values in the probucol treatment group showed significant decreases, but those in the pravastatin treatment group did not. We discussed the mechanisms of the two drugs on the regression of xanthelasma and the mechanisms of development of xanthelasma.", 
    "112": "The interaction between simvastatin (SV), a prodrug lactone, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which converts to the active hydroxy acid form (SVH) in vivo, and cholestyramine (CT), an anionic exchange resin, was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. In an in vitro SV-stability study, it was shown that SV degraded gradually to SVH in an aqueous solution at pH 2 and 7. To evaluate the binding ability of SV or SVH to CT, the incubation of 5 micrograms/ml of SV or SVH solution with 200 mg of CT in various pH (2.0, 5.0 and 7.0) solutions was performed at 37 degrees C for 10 min. After incubation, the concentration of SV decreased by 59.02% (pH 2), 63.90% (pH 5) and 67.36% (pH 7), respectively, and an interaction between SV and CT was suggested. The values were much larger than those expected from the stability test of SV in the absence of CT. SVH was found to bind more strongly to CT. The binding ability of SVH to CT was 66.71% (pH 2), 87.44% (pH 5) and 92.11% (pH 7), respectively. Judging from these results, SV was considered to interact with CT by the following procedure: SV underwent hydrolysis to SVH in aqueous solution, then CT activated the hydrolysis by binding the formed SVH, resulting in a significant reduction in concentration of SV. On the other hand, an in vivo animal experiment also demonstrated a significant reduction (about 50% with AUC) in the concentration of SVH in plasma following the coadministration of SV (500 mg/kg p.o.) and CT (600 mg/kg p.o.), compared with the administration of SV alone. This phenomenon suggested that a combination therapy using SV and CT might result in a smaller cholesterol-lowering effect of SV.", 
    "113": "YM 9429 (cis-1-[4-(p-menthan-8-yloxy)phenyl]piperidine) is a hypolipidemic agent with a potent and specific teratogenicity, inducing cleft palate and skeletal variations in rats. Since cleft palate is generally observed in the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, a common syndrome of multiple congenital anomalies caused by reduced activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase (3 beta-hydroxysteroid delta 7-reductase), the final enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, YM 9429 was suspected of being an inhibitor of this enzyme. To prove this hypothesis, YM 9429 was added to cultured human skin fibroblasts and to cultured Morris hepatoma cells and incubated with [5-3H]mevalonolactone. After 24 h, radiolabeled 7-dehydrocholesterol accumulated in the cells, whereas the formation of radiolabeled cholesterol was markedly reduced. The results indicate that YM 9429 inhibits the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase. In rat liver microsomes, the mode of inhibition was found to be noncompetitive, with a Ki of 40 microM. These results suggest that YM 9429 induced developmental abnormalities in rats by the same mechanism as the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. This compound might be useful for studying the pathogenesis of anomalies in animal models of the Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome.", 
    "114": "The development of hepatic and ileal -hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was studied in three types of young pigs crossbred, obese, and lean pigs). Pigs were fed one of two diets: a high-fat (coconut oil), high-cholesterol 1.0%; designated HC) diet or a high-fat, noncholesterol (designated NC) diet from postpartum d 3 to d 13, 25, and 42 (crossbred only). There were four pigs per age per diet group (except for obese pigs). Liver and ileal mucosal microsomal reductase activities were determined by the conversion of [14C]HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid followed by lactonization of the product. The samples were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and liquid scintillation spectrometry. Hepatic reductase activity (1 unit of specific activity = 1 pmol.min-1.mg protein-1) was < 20 units on d 3 in all groups. By d 13, the activity was 40 to 46 units in all groups of pigs fed HC and approximately 50 to 80 units in pigs fed NC. Reductase activity then decreased at d 25 to 18 to 40 units in pigs fed NC and to < 14 units in pigs fed HC. The d 42 reductase values (crossbred only) were approximately 14 units for pigs fed both HC and NC diets. Intestinal reductase activity was not affected (P > .1) by either age or diet. The data suggest that dietary cholesterol suppressed hepatic reductase activity in young pigs (d 13 and 25) from divergent genetic backgrounds. The data also suggest that the stage of development is a dominant factor in regulating porcine hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity, which was considerably increased at d 13, even in pigs fed HC diets. The relatively modest increase in plasma cholesterol, even in pigs fed cholesterol during the suckling period, provides evidence that both dietary and endogenously synthesized cholesterol are probably used predominantly for tissue building in very young pigs (d 13)."
