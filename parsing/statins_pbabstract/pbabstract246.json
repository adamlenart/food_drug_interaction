    "0": "Coronary heart disease is a major cause of mortality in women in Western industrialised countries, particularly after the age of 50 years, coinciding with the onset of the menopause and potentially adverse metabolic changes that occur during the transitional peri-menopausal and post-menopausal periods. Dyslipidaemia characterised by increases in plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) together with the emergence of other diagnostic features of the metabolic syndrome are key factors that increase cardiovascular risk. Treatment beyond LDL-C with a combination of different lipid-modifying therapies may therefore be of greater importance in women than men. Fibrates and nicotinic acid are two treatments that may be added to primary statin therapy. Fibrates are more effective in lowering elevated triglycerides, whereas nicotinic acid is more effective in raising HDL-C. Although there is clearly a need for clinical trials in women, the available data suggests that combination lipid-modifying therapy is a logical treatment strategy in this high-risk patient group.", 
    "1": "The determinants of cerebral complications of type 2 diabetes are unclear. The present study aimed to identify metabolic and vascular factors that are associated with impaired cognitive performance and abnormalities on brain MRI in patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "2": "The study included 122 patients and 56 controls. Neuropsychological test scores were divided into five cognitive domains and expressed as standardised z values. Brain MRI scans were rated for white matter lesions (WML), cortical and subcortical atrophy, and infarcts. Data on glucose metabolism, vascular risk factors and micro- and macrovascular disease were collected.", 
    "3": "Patients with type 2 diabetes had more cortical (p < 0.001) and subcortical (p < 0.01) atrophy and deep WML (p = 0.02) than the control group and their cognitive performance was worse. In multivariate regression analyses within the type 2 diabetes group, hypertension (p < 0.05) and a history of vascular events (p < 0.01) were associated with worse cognitive performance, while statin use was associated (p < 0.05) with better performance. Retinopathy and brain infarcts on MRI were associated with more severe cortical atrophy (both p < 0.01) and statin use with less atrophy (p < 0.05). Insulin level and brain infarcts were associated with more severe WML and statin use with less severe WML (all p < 0.05).", 
    "4": "Type 2 diabetes is associated with modest impairments in cognition, as well as atrophy and vascular lesions on MRI. This 'diabetic encephalopathy' is a multifactorial condition, for which atherosclerotic (macroangiopathic) vascular disease is an important determinant. Chronic hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hypertension may play additional roles.", 
    "5": "To determine whether protein prenylation (farnesyl/geranylgeranylation) regulates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), and whether MMP-1 secretion can be regulated by statins or prenyltransferase inhibitors via effects mediated by ERK, JNK, and NF-kappaB.", 
    "6": "RASFs obtained from patients during elective knee replacement surgery were assessed by immunoblotting and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for secretion of MMP-1 and MMP-13 in the presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), statins, the farnesyl transferase (FT) inhibitor FTI-276 and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-298, and prenyl substrates (farnesyl pyrophosphate [FPP] and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate [GGPP]). Activities of JNK and ERK were determined by phosphoimmunoblotting, and NF-kappaB activation was determined by nuclear translocation of the p65 component.", 
    "7": "FTI-276, but not statins, inhibited RASF secretion of MMP-1, but not MMP-13, following induction with TNFalpha (P = 0.0007) or IL-1beta (P = 0.006). Loading RASFs with FPP to promote farnesylation enhanced MMP-1 secretion. FTI-276 inhibited activation of JNK (P < 0.05) and NF-kappaB (P = 0.02), but not ERK. In contrast, GGTI-298 enhanced, while GGPP inhibited, MMP-1 secretion. FTI-276 and GGTI-298 together had no effect on MMP-1 secretion. Stimulation of RASFs with TNFalpha or IL-1beta led to increased expression and activity of FT.", 
    "8": "Protein farnesylation is required for expression and secretion of MMP-1 from RASFs, via effects on JNK and NF-kappaB. The ability of cytokines to stimulate the expression and activity of FT suggests that FT may be increased in the rheumatoid joint. In contrast, geranylgeranylation down-regulates MMP-1 expression. Statins simultaneously inhibit farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, and in consequence do not inhibit MMP-1 secretion. The ability of FTI-276 to inhibit MMP-1 secretion suggests a potential therapeutic strategy in RA.", 
    "9": "The purpose of this study was to heighten awareness of a potentially life-threatening drug interaction in patients with chronic uveitis treated with cyclosporine. A 69-year-old female with chronic posterior uveitis was treated with cyclosporine while on concomitant oral simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia. Rhabdomyolysis developed with acute renal failure from the probable interaction between these drugs. Discontinuation of simvastatin and cyclosporine resulted in resolution of rhabdomyolysis and normalization of renal function. Statins are associated with a small, dose-related risk of myopathy, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. Cyclosporine is a potent inhibitor of simvastatin metabolism, and may therefore facilitate simvastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Concomitant use of statins and cyclosporine should be avoided.", 
    "10": "Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are prone to premature atherosclerosis. Though atherosclerosis-related coronary artery disease in young lupus patients has been reported, there are a few reports on related central nervous system (CNS) involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus. It is imperative to differentiate CNS-atherosclerosis from active lupus as aggressive immunosuppressive treatment is often the choice for the latter. Two cases of young lupus patients with transient loss of consciousness and cerebral infarctions are reported, in whom atherosclerosis was considered as the major risk factor. Both were premenopausal young women who had more than 10-year histories of lupus. Besides CNS symptoms, they did not have any sign suggesting lupus flare. Both had hyperlipidemia without family histories, and carotid ultrasound showed bilateral atherosclerotic plaques. Both responded to treatment with statins and antiplatelet agents.", 
    "11": "The majority of patients with previous ischemic stroke are expected to benefit significantly from long-term statin therapy. However, discontinuation of medication therapy frequently occurs in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of discontinued statin therapy on clinical outcome in patients discharged after an acute ischemic stroke.", 
    "12": "The study population included 631 consecutive stroke survivors (322 men and 309 women; mean+/-SD age, 70.2+/-7.6 years) without clinical evidence of coronary heart disease. All patients were discharged on statin therapy and were followed up for 12 months after the acute ischemic stroke.", 
    "13": "Within 12 months from discharge, 246 patients (38.9%) discontinued statin therapy; the mean time from discharge to statin discontinuation was 48.6+/-54.9 days (median time, 30 days; interquartile range, 18 to 55 days). During follow-up, 116 patients died (1-year probability of death=0.18; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.21). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that after adjustment for all confounders and interactions, statin therapy discontinuation (hazard ratio=2.78; 95% CI, 1.96 to 3.72; P=0.003) was an independent predictor of all-cause 1-year mortality.", 
    "14": "A large number of patients discontinue their use of statins early after acute stroke. Moreover, patients discontinuing statins have a significantly increased mortality during the first year after the acute cerebrovascular event. These findings suggest that patient care should be improved during the transition from a hospital setting to outpatient primary care.", 
    "15": "Statin therapy is associated with changes in low-density, very low-density, and high- density lipoprotein metabolism. The effect of statin therapy on a minor high-density lipoprotein particle containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D has not been examined. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) has been implicated in triglyceride metabolism. A double-blind, crossover design comparing the effect of simvastatin (80 mg) and atorvastatin (80 mg) on serum lipid and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D levels was conducted in 13 patients with low high-density lipoproteins. Both statins reduced cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B and significantly lowered serum glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D levels (16%). This statin effect seems to occur in the plasma compartment as neither statin altered GPI-PLD mRNA levels in HepG2 cells. Serum glycosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase D levels are regulated by statins and may represent an additional biochemical mechanism for affecting serum triglyceride levels.", 
    "16": "Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction and, with less robust evidence, reduction of triglyceride levels and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although the statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy, they may not be adequate to accomplish all of the changes in lipid and lipoprotein levels called for in current guidelines. Combinations of one or more lipid-modifying drugs in addition to lifestyle changes are now part of clinical guidelines and are being used extensively in practice. Clinicians need to be familiar with the individual drugs and how they interact. There is also a need for outcome data with combination therapy, especially for statin-fibrate and statin-niacin combinations. Several clinical trials are underway and should provide further evidence for the benefit of combination therapy of dyslipidemia. New drug classes have the potential to provide additive effects with currently available medications to provide substantial LDL reduction and increased HDL level that may lead to a substantial reduction in the burden of atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

    "18": "Data of OAG suspects who had undergone at least two CSLO tests at the Beckman Vision Center at UCSF from January 2001 to June 2006 was collected. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 149 eyes from 76 patients considered suspect for glaucoma based on a cup-to-disc ratio >0.5, but with normal intraocular pressures (IOP) and visual fields. Subjects included glaucoma suspects who took statin drugs or aspirin for greater than 23 months. The control group consisted of suspects who never used statins or aspirin. The data were analysed using mixed effects regression.", 
    "19": "When comparing controls with the statin group there were significant differences in the progression of multiple CSLO parameters per year, including rim volume (-13.7% controls, +26.7% statin only; P = 0.0156), retinal nerve fibre layer cross-sectional area (-12.2% controls, +24.3% statin only; P = 0.0051), and mean global retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (-10.3% controls, +26.6% statin only; P = 0.0114), with adjustment for age, gender, race, IOP, central corneal thickness, refractive error and multiple systemic comorbidities. No significant differences were found when comparing subjects taking a statin plus aspirin or aspirin alone with the controls.", 
    "20": "Statin drugs may be associated with slowed progression of optic nerve parameters in glaucoma suspects as measured by CSLO.", 
    "21": "The present study was designed to determine whether hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) modulate the NO production via iNOS in adipocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (L) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (T). Well-differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes significantly produced NO by LT-treatment. Pre-incubation with simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, pravastatin, a hydrophilic one, or Y27632, an inhibitor of Rho kinase, further enhanced the production of NO. The effect of simvastatin was offset by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) but not by squalene. The mRNA level for iNOS parallelled the NO production. The NF-kappaB was activated by the LT-treatment and was further enhanced by simvastatin, pravastatin or Y27632 addition. Mevalonate and GGPP completely offset the effect of simvastatin. Statins and Y27632 also further increased the interleukin-6 secretion in the LT-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results suggest that statins, especially lipophilic type, enhance induction of iNOS by inhibiting the small GTP-binding protein signal in adipocytes.", 
    "22": "This study assessed the efficacy of rosuvastatin for reducing plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol after 18 weeks of open-label, forced titration in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (hoFH) and compared the efficacy of rosuvastatin 80 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg. Forty-four patients aged 8-63 years (body mass >or=32 kg) entered the study; 4 had portacaval shunts and 11 were receiving plasmapheresis. Patients sequentially received rosuvastatin 20, 40 and 80 mg/day for 6 weeks. Patients remaining in the trial after 18 weeks received double-blind, randomised crossover treatment with rosuvastatin 80 mg/day and atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 6 weeks each. After 18 weeks, mean (S.D.)% reduction from baseline in LDL cholesterol was 22 (21)% overall and by 26 (15)% in 29 patients who neither had a portacaval shunt nor were receiving plasmapheresis. Seventy-two percent of the patients had >or=15% reductions in LDL cholesterol and were considered responders and included patients who had portacaval shunts or were receiving plasmapheresis. Mean LDL reductions from baseline after crossover treatment (n=21) with rosuvastatin 80 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg were 19 and 18%, respectively. All treatments were well tolerated. Rosuvastatin may have therapeutic value in the management of hoFH.",

    "24": "Statin-induced reduction of cell viability and apoptosis was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and caspase assay. Intracellular accumulation of statins was determined using an HPLC system.", 
    "25": "Rosuvastatin cytotoxicity, reduction of cell viability, morphological changes and caspase activation at acidic pH (pH 6.8) were significantly greater than those at neutral pH (pH 7.4). Rosuvastatin accumulation at acidic pH was greater than that at pH 7.4. On the other hand, medium pH had no effect on pravastatin accumulation.",

    "29": "Because of the acute renal failure and proteinuria a renal biopsy was taken, as well as a skin biopsy from the patients foot. Both biopsies showed cholesterol crystal emboli with elongated, biconvex transparent clefts and an inflammatory reaction of the vessel wall which had caused obstruction. Renal function did not recover, and the patient was transferred to the chronic dialysis program. Treatment with a statin was initiated and her blood pressure normalized.", 
    "30": "In most cases cholesterol crystal embolism is iatrogenic. This multiorgan syndrome occurs in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol crystals from ruptured atheromatous plaques become lodged in peripheral arteries and induce an obliterating inflammation of the vessel wall. Mortality is high (about 38 %).",

EL is known to act as a bridging molecule for monocytes or lipoproteins in vascular endothelial cells. We investigated the role and regulatory mechanisms of EL expression in macrophages.", 
    "36": "Macrophages originating from wild-type (EL+/+) and EL-deficient (EL-/-) mice were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The expression of EL mRNA was evaluated by northern blotting. DiI-LDL was used to measure the uptake of native low-density lipoprotein (nLDL).", 
    "37": "LPS increased EL mRNA levels by increasing intracellular oxidative stress in the macrophages. LPS did not affect EL expression in macrophages derived from Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) gene mutant mice, C3H/HeJ. The uptake of nLDL after LPS-treatment was significantly lower in macrophages from EL-/- mice than those from EL+/+ mice. Simvastatin suppressed the LPS-induced upregulation of EL expression and uptake of nLDL.", 
    "38": "EL expression is upregulated by LPS via TLR4 and promotes the uptake of nLDL by macrophages. Simvastatin inhibits the LPS-induced up-regulation and uptake in macrophages. Thus, our findings provide a novel role for EL in lipoprotein metabolism and would expand the range of anti-atherogenic effects of statins.",

Since that time statins have fully confirmed their promises and play now a crucial role in the battle against cardiovascular diseases. The last decade has been dominated by two demonstrations that apparently are discordant: (1) the lower the cholesterol level with the pharmacological intervention, the lower the risk of cardiovascular complications, arguing for the use of very efficacious cholesterol-lowering therapies; and (2) the cardiovascular protection provided by statins is present whatever the baseline cholesterol level, supporting the concept of pleiotropic effects of statins. As a consequence, statin treatment should be prescribed and intensified according to the high individual cardiovascular risk rather than because of the cholesterol level stricto sensu. Statin therapy should be completed by the addition of ezetimibe when LDL cholesterol level remains above target values or by the addition of fenofibrate when triglyceride levels are high and/or HDL cholesterol level is low. New pharmacological approaches aiming at further improving lipid profile, especially by targeting low HDL cholesterol levels, are currently in clinical development.",

At this time, rosuvastatin 5 mg daily was initiated. On April 20, 2006, laboratory tests revealed an AST of 30 IU/L, ALT of 58 IU/L, ALP of 99 IU/L, and SCr of 1.0 mg/dL. Because of the severity of her aortic stenosis, the patient underwent aortic valve replacement on May 15, 2006, and amiodarone was initiated. Laboratory tests completed on May 31, 2006, revealed an AST of 192 IU/L, ALT of 336 IU/L, ALP of 322 IU/L, and SCr of 1.1 mg/dL. She did not report any symptoms of myopathy or liver dysfunction. Ultrasound revealed no liver abnormalities. The rosuvastatin was discontinued because of a potential interaction with the amiodarone. One week after the rosuvastatin was stopped, her laboratory tests showed an AST of 68 IU/L, an ALT of 126 IU/L, an ALP of 292 IU/L, a creatine kinase concentration of 22 IU/L, and an SCr of 1.0 mg/dL.

However, recent data suggest that their effects go well beyond the lipid lowering seen with long-term use and may include acute antiinflammatory activity, anticoagulation, immunomodulation, as well as promotion of changes in smooth-muscle tone. Because of these data, promising research has begun into the use of these agents in various critical care areas such as the early phases of sepsis, bacteremia, and ischemic stroke. Recent data also show a decrease in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, an area deficient in therapeutic options. More research is necessary to ascertain the true role of statins in the treatment of these various disorders. Nevertheless, the concept of a statin's role as being only a routine preventive therapy with benefits limited to patients undergoing extended treatment is rapidly becoming inaccurate.",

Dyslipidemia is one of the primary causes of atherosclerosis and effective interventions to correct dyslipidemia should form an integral component of any strategy aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease. Fibrates have played a major role in the treatment of hyperlipidemia for more than two decades. Fenofibrate is one of the most commonly used fibrates worldwide. Since fenofibrate was first introduced in clinical practice, a major drawback has been its low bioavailability when taken under fasting conditions. Insoluble Drug Delivery-Microparticle fenofibrate is a new formulation that has an equivalent extent of absorption under fed or fasting conditions. In this review, we will discuss the clinical pharmacology of fenofibrate, with particular emphasis on this novel formulation, as well as its lipid-modulating and pleiotropic actions. We will also analyze the major trial that evaluated fibrates for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the safety and efficacy profile of fibrate-statin combination treatment, and the current recommendations regarding the use of fibrates in clinical practice.",

To clarify whether statin lipophilicity affects prognosis, a post hoc analysis of the MUSASHI-AMI database was performed. Patients who were assigned to receive statin were separated into 2 groups according to the lipophilicity of the statins they were administered: lipophilic statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin and simvastatin; LS group; n=131) or hydrophilic statins (pravastatin; HS group; n=110). There was no difference in baseline LDL-C concentrations between the 2 groups. Although LDL-C was decreased more potently in the LS than HS groups (-34% vs -19%; p=0.0069), acute coronary syndrome events tended to occur less frequently (3.6% vs 9.9%; p=0.0530) and the incidence of new Q-wave appearance in electrocardiogram was significantly lower (75% vs 89%; p=0.0056) in the HS than LS groups.",

Despite substantial efforts from different public and private organizations to educate the population on cardiovascular risk, coronary heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and its prevalence continues to grow. Therefore, alternative approaches with the potential to elicit a meaningful impact in the community deserve consideration. A nonprescription statin program could provide consumers with a tool of proved benefit in cardiovascular risk prevention. The magnitude of the target population (millions of subjects with intermediate to high risk), as well as the safety and efficacy profile of lovastatin 20 mg, support the consideration of this drug for \"over-the-counter\" availability. Moreover, a nonprescription statin program could represent a unique opportunity not only to enhance patients' involvement in primary prevention but also to reinforce the education of the public and to encourage interaction with health care providers. The success of such a program will undoubtedly require precise labeling of the risks and benefits of the therapy, as well as active support and participation from major medical organizations. In conclusion, nonprescription statin availability, through enhanced unique patients' involvement, offers the potential for enormous public health benefit.",

We conducted a prospective study to determine the acute effect (24 hours) of single-dose atorvastatin (20 mg) on brachial artery endothelial function using vascular ultrasonography (flow-mediated vasodilation [FMD]) and blood flow in normolipidemic smokers (10 men, 42 +/- 9 years of age) and healthy nonsmokers (10 men, 39 +/- 7 years of age). Atorvastatin increased brachial artery percent FMD in smokers from 4.1 +/- 1.4% to 5.7 +/- 1.7% (p <0.0005), whereas we found no significant change after atorvastatin in nonsmokers (from 5.8 +/- 1.2% to 5.9 +/- 1.2%, p = NS). The velocity time integral also showed a significant increase as percent FMD in smokers 24 hours after taking atorvastatin (from 19 +/- 11 to 25 +/- 12 cm, p <0.05), whereas no significant change occurred in nonsmokers (from 18 +/- 9 to 19 +/- 10 cm, p = NS). Baseline brachial artery diameter significantly dilated in smokers after taking atorvastatin compared with before taking atorvastatin (from 4.23 +/- 0.5 to 4.35 +/- 0.4 mm, p <0.05), but did not change in nonsmokers (from 4.26 +/- 0.6 to 4.31 +/- 0.6 mm, p = NS). In conclusion, single-dose atorvastatin restores endothelial function and increases brachial artery blood flow in normolipidemic men smokers within 24 hours. These findings suggest early benefits of statin therapy on endothelial function in smokers.", 
    "92": "Myonecrosis, manifested by an increase in cardiac markers, may occur in up to 50% of patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The degree of periprocedural myonecrosis, measured by the peak creatine kinase-MB fraction, has been associated with incidence of adverse clinical outcomes. Therefore, strategies to decrease myonecrosis may translate into a decrease in mortality. We evaluated the efficacy of statin pretreatment in decreasing the incidence of myonecrosis after PCI on the basis of results of published studies. A systematic search of the PubMed database from its inception to October 2006 and from the references of identified studies was performed. Only studies with concurrent control groups were included. Information on baseline characteristics of included patients and clinical outcomes was independently extracted by 2 investigators. A random effects model was used to pool odds ratios of the incidence of periprocedural myonecrosis in statin-treated patients versus controls. A total of 9 trials was included in the analysis, 2 randomized trials (n = 604) and 7 retrospective cohort studies (n = 4,751), which assessed the impact of statin pretreatment on periprocedural myonecrosis. During this period, 196 of 2,149 patients (9%) in the statin-treated group compared with 455 of 2,602 (17.5%) in the control group (odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.62, p <0.01) developed myonecrosis. In conclusion, based on existing evidence, routine pretreatment with statins may decrease the risk of postprocedure myonecrosis. Large randomized controlled trials addressing the dose, duration, and type of statin on periprocedural myonecrosis are necessary before recommending routine use of statins to prevent myonecrosis in the elective PCI setting.", 
    "93": "High-dose statin therapy has been demonstrated to provide incremental benefit when low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations are lowered well below recommended target levels. This secondary analysis of the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study was conducted to investigate whether the attainment of very low LDL cholesterol levels was associated with a further reduction in major cardiovascular events compared with higher LDL cholesterol concentrations and whether any incremental benefit was achieved without additional safety risk. Patients with coronary heart disease and LDL cholesterol levels <130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/L) were randomized to therapy with atorvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 5,006) or 80 mg/day (n = 4,995). The primary end point was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event. Clinical outcomes and safety data were compared across on-treatment LDL cholesterol quintiles. There was a highly significant reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events with descending achieved levels of on-treatment LDL cholesterol (p <0.0001 for trend across LDL cholesterol). Analysis of individual components of the primary end point demonstrated similar results. Death from any cause and from noncardiovascular causes was lowest in patients with the lowest on-treatment LDL cholesterol levels. Cardiovascular deaths were also reduced with lower levels of on-treatment LDL cholesterol. There were no clinically important differences in adverse event rates across quintiles. Specifically, no increase in muscle complaints, suicide, hemorrhagic stroke, or cancer deaths was observed at the lowest LDL cholesterol levels. In conclusion, the present analysis adds support to the concept that for patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, a further risk reduction without sacrifice of safety can be achieved by reducing LDL cholesterol to very low levels.",

Overall, 77.7% and 59.0% of ongoing users in 2005 and 2003, respectively, received minimal-guideline therapy (P < .0001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment did not differ between 2003 and 2005 continuing statin users. Among very-high-risk patients who initiated statin treatment, a significantly greater proportion of patients in 2005 versus 2003 attained the optional goal of <70 mg/dL (45.5% vs 34.4% P = .014).

Perioperative statin use reduces all-cause mortality at 30 days and cardiac death at 60 days and 1 year post-CABG but does not appear to reduce myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure rates. Multiple studies have demonstrated that pre- and postoperative beta-blockers are associated with a decrease in atrial fibrillation. In addition, beta-blockers may reduce inhospital and 30-day mortality, although these results are not consistent across all studies.

Overall, the mixed results, combined with potential for adverse effects when given in combination with statins, have limited the use of these fibrates as cardioprotective agents. However, post hoc analyses of several of the fibrate studies have shown that people with features of the metabolic syndrome, particularly overweight people with high plasma triglyceride levels and low levels of HDL cholesterol, derive a disproportionately large reduction in cardiovascular events when treated with these agents. Thus, there is a strong case for the use of a fibrate to reduce the cardiovascular risk in overweight people with high triglyceride and low HDL-C.

Recently, it became obvious that at least two types of EPC can be cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In this work we focused on the fraction of the easily accessible early EPC, which can be generated in clinically relevant amounts within 5 days. Periods of hyper-inflammation, systemic or local, often occur during a multiple trauma. Thus, this study was conducted to elucidate the influence of the prototypical proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on the survival of early EPC. In the past years it was observed that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) exert protective effects during inflammatory processes. Therefore, the effect of a preconditioning of early EPC with simvastatin on the survival of EPC under proinflammatory conditions was tested as well. Incubation with 50 mu/mL TNF-alpha [0.45 ng/mL] or IL-1beta [0.25 ng/mL] resulted in a 3-fold (18.4 +/- 2.9%), respectively, 4-fold (25.5 +/- 3.4%) increase of apoptotic EPC in comparison to the untreated control (6.1 +/- 1.6%). In accordance, 24 h after the cytokines had been added, the EPC number per high power field decreased significantly. A preconditioning with simvastatin [25 microM] resulted in significant inhibition of the TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, whereas the IL-1beta-mediated apoptosis was only slightly reduced. In conclusion, this study shows clearly that TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are harmful to early EPC and that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin protects EPC from TNF-alpha- and eventually from IL-1beta-mediated apoptosis. These results suggest that simvastatin has protective effects on EPC survival and differentiation in a hyperinflammatory situation.",

A goal of the present study was to evaluate these aspects among psychotic inpatients who were prescribed SGAs in a typical clinical setting. The study sample consisted of 28 psychotic male forensic psychiatric inpatients (mean age 44 years). All had sGA medication for their psychotic symptoms. secondary causes of dyslipidemia were excluded and statin therapy was initiated, according to the established guidelines. The change in TC, LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) levels were evaluated retrospectively and analysed by the Wilcoxon signed Ranks test. The lowering effectivity of statin treatment was 36% for TC, 49% for LDL-C and 29% for TG. Most of the patients (84%) achieved a target value for LDL-C of <3.0 mmol/L, and 54% achieved target value of <2.6 mmol/L, while HDL-C remained unchanged. These results were achieved with a low or moderate dose of statin during a period of 1 month. The effect of statins in lowering of TC, LDL-C and TG among dyslipidemic psychiatric patients that were treated with sGA was similar to the effectiveness of statin therapy in other clinical trial settings, and should be used when they are indicated.",

The recommended starting dose of simvastatin 40 mg is approved as a lipid-lowering agent and for all high-risk patients, including those with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, regardless of the baseline LDL level. Simvastatin dose should be adjusted in those receiving CYP3A4 inhibitors, gemfibrozil, or ciclosporin, amiodarone, or in those with severe renal insufficiency.

The GREACE study compared usual with structured care aimed at achieving LDL-C = 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) by dose titration with atorvastatin. All patients had CHD and were followed for 3 years. This post hoc analysis of GREACE examines the effect of statins on TAG levels and their relation with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in all patients and in the subgroup of patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Baseline TAG levels >150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) were predictive of subsequent CVD events [cardiac mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina (UA), revascularisation, congestive heart failure (CHF), and stroke] only in statin untreated patients. Stepwise regression analysis showed that with every 20% statin-related TAG reduction there was a decrease in CVD risk by 12% (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75-0.95, P = 0.007) in the structured care group vs. the usual care group, by 8% (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81-0.97, P = 0.02) in all statin treated patients vs. the untreated ones and by 15% (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65-0.94, P = 0.005) in those with MetS treated with a statin vs. those untreated.

Dyslipidemia and other traditional cardiac risk factors occur frequently in pediatric SLE and are often under-recognized and under-treated. Two dyslipidemia patterns are evident in pediatric SLE. Active disease is characterized by elevated triglycerides (TG) and low high density lipoprotein (HDL). With SLE treatment HDL and TG often normalize, while total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) rise. The complex pathophysiology of dyslipidemia in SLE involves cytokines, autoantibodies, disease activity, medications, diet, and physical activity level, as well as other factors. Routine screening for dyslipidemia with fasting lipid profiles is indicated for children and adolescents with SLE. If lipoprotein levels are abnormal, first line therapy involves diet and exercise interventions for a minimum of six months. For persistent dyslipidemia, several pharmacologic therapies are available. Hydroxychloroquine, a common treatment for SLE, can improve lipid profiles and should be considered for all patients with SLE. Statins and bile acid sequestrants are typically added first for dyslipidemia, while niacin and fibrates are reserved for refractory disease and optimally prescribed in a multidisciplinary lipid clinic. Future research is needed to further illuminate the mechanisms of dyslipidemia in pediatric SLE with well designed clinical trials to determine the safest and most effective interventions to correct lipid profiles and prevent atherosclerosis.",

According to the health recommendations the daily intake should not exceed 300 mg and in the case of people with cardiovascular disease it should be less than 200 mg. For 50 years it is known that phytosterols can decrease the level of cholesterol in blood. One of the mechanisms is based on the fact that phytosterols stop absorption of cholesterol in digestive tract, which results in the decrease of the concentration of cholesterol in blood. The second mechanism is based on the fact that cholesterol is pumped back out of enterocytes into the lumen of small intestine by ABC transporter and phytosterols increase this process. The above merftioned mechanisms are different than the way statins can lower cholesterol level and they are commonly used as hipocholesterolemic medicine. Because different mechanisms are implemented both statins and fitosterols can be used in therapy of hipercholeserolemia.

The source and regulation of the isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) used in the biosynthesis of artemisinin has not been completely characterized. Terpenoid biosynthesis occurs in plants via two IPP-generating pathways: the mevalonate pathway in the cytosol, and the non-mevalonate pathway in plastids. Using inhibitors specific to each pathway, it is possible to resolve which supplies the IPP precursor to the end product. Here, we show the effects of inhibition on the two pathways leading to IPP for artemisinin production in plants. We grew young (7-14 days post cotyledon) plants in liquid culture, and added mevinolin to the medium to inhibit the mevalonate pathway, or fosmidomycin to inhibit the non-mevalonate pathway. Artemisinin levels were measured after 7-14 days incubation, and production was significantly reduced by each inhibitor compared to controls, thus, it appears that IPP from both pathways is used in artemisinin production. Also when grown in miconazole, an inhibitor of sterol biosynthesis, there was a significant increase in artemisinin compared to controls suggesting that carbon was shifted from sterols into sesquiterpenes. Collectively these results indicate that artemisinin is probably biosynthesized from IPP pools from both the plastid and the cytosol, and that carbon from competing pathways can be channeled toward sesquiterpenes. This information will help advance our understanding of the regulation of in planta production of artemisinin.",

    "170": "Essential hypertension can be defined as a rise in blood pressure of unknown cause that increases risk for cerebral, cardiac, and renal events. In industrialised countries, the risk of becoming hypertensive (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg) during a lifetime exceeds 90%. Essential hypertension usually clusters with other cardiovascular risk factors such as ageing, being overweight, insulin resistance, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia. Subtle target-organ damage such as left-ventricular hypertrophy, microalbuminuria, and cognitive dysfunction takes place early in the course of hypertensive cardiovascular disease, although catastrophic events such as stroke, heart attack, renal failure, and dementia usually happen after long periods of uncontrolled hypertension only. All antihypertensive drugs lower blood pressure (by definition) and this decline is the best determinant of cardiovascular risk reduction. However, differences between drugs exist with respect to reduction of target-organ disease and prevention of major cardiovascular events. Most hypertensive patients need two or more drugs for blood-pressure control and concomitant statin treatment for risk factor reduction. Despite the availability of effective and safe antihypertensive drugs, hypertension and its concomitant risk factors remain uncontrolled in most patients.",

DU145 cells were perfused with PB in the presence or absence of 10 microM of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin, and the results monitored by 31P and diffusion-weighted 1H NMR spectroscopy. Lovastatin had additive effects on the PB-induced NMR-visible total choline in 1H spectra, and glycerophosphocholine in 31P spectra but no significant effect on NMR-visible lipid. Moreover, lovastatin had no effect on the ability of PB to either promote the formation of oil red O-detectable lipid droplets or arrest the cell cycle. The most remarkable observations from these studies were that lovastatin enhanced the increase in glycerophosphocholine while reversing late markers of apoptosis and the loss of NTP caused by PB.

All were asymptomatic thereby distinguishing NCP from thrombi in coronary arteries. Following LDL cholesterol measurements, all were given 10 mg of Atorvastatin (2 were given 5 mg as LDL cholesterol levels were already <70 mg/dl) for 1 year, at which point MSCT and LDL cholesterol measurements were repeated. One remarkable NCP was selected in each subject and evaluated as representative of the effect of Atorvastatin. The area and CT values for NCP, excluding calcified portions, were manually measured from axial source or multiplanar reconstruction images under the same conditions using an workstation (Virtual Place Advance Plus, AZE).", 
    "174": "Twenty-one NCPs (18 left anterior descending branch, 2 left circumflex branch, and 1 right coronary artery) were evaluated. Mean LDL cholesterol levels were 122 mg/dl at the first scan and significantly decreased to 96 mg/ml at the second scan (P<0.05). The NCP areas were 2-31 mm(2) (mean 11.8) at the first scan, and 2-32 mm(2) (mean 12.6) at the second scan. These differences were not significantly different. The averages of CT values were 15-91 HU (mean 55 HU) at the first scan and 38-114 HU (mean 62 HU) at the second scan. SDs of CT values of the two scans were 14-64 HU (mean 40 HU) and 20-68 HU (mean 45 HU), respectively. The averages and SDs of CT values were significantly higher in the second scan (P<0.05). There was a weak but significant positive correlation between ratios (%) of change in area to baseline area at first scan of NCPs (y) and LDL cholesterol levels (x) after 1 year of Atorvastatin treatment (y=0.0106x-0.7265, R(2)=0.1514, R=0.39, P<0.05).",

Atorvastatin may decrease area of NCP if LDL cholesterol levels are sufficiently reduced. Also, it may increase CT values, which could suggest a change in NCP composition. LDL cholesterol levels may be an important factor in decreasing NCP area. Further studies are needed using 64-slice MSCT in a larger population exhibiting greater decreases in LDL cholesterol levels.",

The carotid model of deendothelialization by balloon and (or) thromboembolism occlusion was established, and 4 weeks after balloon injury, the reendothelialization ratio and restenosis ratio of each subjects were observed. The outcomes revealed that there is a natural self-repair phenomenon, featured as low level reendothelialization and restenosis inhibition, which can be significantly augmented under atrovastatin treatment. Yet when the blood circulation discontinued, not only the self-repair process, but also atrovastatin's beneficial effects on reendothelialization and restenosis disappeared.

    "179": "The objective of this study was to determine whether the long-term administration of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, confers protective effects against stroke events in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs). Atorvastatin (2 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg) or vehicle was orally administered to 8-week-old SHRSPs for 11 weeks. The survival ratio and stroke incidence were calculated, and plasma lipids and plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a circulating endogenous competitive inhibitor of NO synthase, were measured after sacrifice. The effect of atorvastatin on local cerebral blood flow (l-CBF) was also determined in 13-week-old SHRSPs after treatment with 20 mg/kg atorvastatin daily for 5 weeks. The survival ratios at 19 weeks of age were 15, 30, and 50% in the vehicle, low-dose (2 mg/kg), and high-dose groups (20 mg/kg), respectively. The survival ratio was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the vehicle group. The incidence of stroke was significantly lower in the high-dose group than in the vehicle group. The levels of ADMA were 0.81+/-0.18 (mean+/-S.D.), 0.62+/-0.09, and 0.61+/-0.06 micromol/l in the vehicle, low-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively. Atorvastatin administration significantly reduced the ADMA levels without affecting the levels of plasma lipids. The level of l-CBF tended to be higher in the treated group, but not to a significant extent. Thus, atorvastatin was determined to confer a protective effect against hypertension-based stroke. The data suggest that the efficacy of the statin for stroke protection may be partially involved in the improvement of endothelial function via NO production and reduction of ADMA. Statins may confer useful protection against not only atherosclerosis-based stroke, but also hypertension-based stroke.", 
    "180": "Vasospasm is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Radiographic vasospasm usually develops between 5 and 15 days after the initial hemorrhage, and is associated with clinically apparent delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DID) in one-third of patients. The pathophysiology of this reversible vasculopathy is not fully understood but appears to involve structural changes and biochemical alterations at the levels of the vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells. Blood in the subarachnoid space is believed to trigger these changes. In addition, cerebral perfusion may be concurrently impaired by hypovolemia and impaired cerebral autoregulatory function. The combined effects of these processes can lead to reduction in cerebral blood flow so severe as to cause ischemia leading to infarction. Diagnosis is made by some combination of clinical, cerebral angiographic, and transcranial doppler ultrasonographic factors. Nimodipine, a calcium channel antagonist, is so far the only available therapy with proven benefit for reducing the impact of DID. Aggressive therapy combining hemodynamic augmentation, transluminal balloon angioplasty, and intra-arterial infusion of vasodilator drugs is, to varying degrees, usually implemented. A panoply of drugs, with different mechanisms of action, has been studied in SAH related vasospasm. Currently, the most promising are magnesium sulfate, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, nitric oxide donors and endothelin-1 antagonists. This paper reviews established and emerging therapies for vasospasm.",

    "185": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the drugs of first choice for treating hypercholesterolaemia in order to prevent or slow the progression of coronary heart disease (CHD). Statins generally reduce the risk of CHD morbidity or mortality by about 30%. Lovastatin is effective in lowering plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and is widely prescribed for both the primary and secondary prevention of CHD. In the major AFCAPS/TexCAPS primary prevention study of 6605 middle-aged or elderly men and women without symptomatic cardiovascular disease and with only moderately elevated serum lipids, treatment with lovastatin 20-40 mg once daily for a mean of 5.2 years significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the incidence of a first acute major cardiac event by 37% compared with placebo. In the smaller ACAPS study of 919 men and women who were asymptomatic for cardiovascular disease, but with evidence of early atherosclerosis, treatment with lovastatin for 3 years significantly (p = 0.001) slowed or reversed atherosclerosis compared with placebo, as measured by changes in the intimal-medial thickness of carotid arteries on B-mode ultrasound. Three randomised, controlled, secondary prevention trials have demonstrated that in patients with coronary artery disease, treatment with lovastatin 20-80 mg/day alone or in combination with colestipol for 2-2.5 years reduced the severity of stenosis and/or slowed or reversed the progression of atherosclerosis, as assessed by angiography. In the FATS study, the severity of stenosis after 2.5 years in recipients of lovastatin plus colestipol was reduced by 2.8% compared with placebo, while the frequency of lesion progression was halved and the frequency of lesion regression was tripled. Treatment with lovastatin for 2.2 years in the MARS study significantly reduced the mean percent diameter stenosis compared with placebo (p = 0.005) in patients with more severe stenosis, and also significantly (p = 0.002) reduced the mean global change score (indicating less progression). In the CCAIT study, lovastatin therapy for 2 years significantly improved coronary change scores (p < 0.01) and significantly reduced the incidence of new lesions (p = 0.001) compared with placebo. Across the primary and secondary prevention studies, lovastatin was shown to be similarly effective in women, the elderly, smokers and in subjects with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, the available data demonstrate that lovastatin provides significant lipid-modifying efficacy, slows progression or causes regression of atherosclerosis, and protects against acute cardiac events, in both those with and those without symptomatic CHD.", 
    "186": "Several studies have found reduced use of recommended medications after myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with impaired kidney function. However, the reasons for such undertreatment are not well understood. A total of 1380 Medicare patients who survived at least 90 d after MI and had prescription drug coverage through Pennsylvania's medication assistance program for the elderly were studied. Filled prescriptions were used to assess use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta blockers, and statins within 90 d of MI. Patients' demographics, comorbidities, and health care utilization before MI also were ascertained. We used logistic regression to test the association between kidney function and postdischarge use of each medication. Overall, 619 (45%) patients filled a prescription for a beta blocker, 675 (49%) received an ACEI or ARB, and 406 (29%) received a statin after discharge but within 90 d after their admission for MI. Reduced kidney function was associated with both lower beta blocker and statin use (P = 0.01 and P = 0.002, respectively), but after multivariate adjustment, these associations disappeared (P = 0.23 and P = 0.62, respectively). Use of ACEI or ARB was nearly half in patients with estimated GFR <30 ml/min compared with patients with better kidney function in univariate and multivariate analyses (P < 0.001). Analyses using serum creatinine measurements rather than estimations of GFR yielded similar results. Differences in other characteristics such as age, rather than kidney function, may be responsible for much or all the reported reduction in use of preventive medications after MI seen in patients with chronic kidney disease.", 
    "187": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is secreted during activation of neutrophils, may serve as one mechanistic link among persistent inflammation, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease. This study related MPO activity to inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, comorbidity, and ongoing medication in prevalent hemodialysis (HD) patients. In a cross-sectional evaluation of 115 prevalent (vintage 25 mo) HD patients (62 men; 63 +/- 1 yr), data on comorbidity (Davies score), diabetes, medication (statins and antihypertensive drugs), nutritional status (subjective global assessment), blood lipids (cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides), inflammatory biomarkers (serum albumin, C-reactive protein, TNF-alpha, and IL-6), oxidative stress biomarkers (pentosidine, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, and MPO activity) were recorded. Patients with MPO activity greater than the median had significantly (P < 0.05) lower serum albumin levels (33.2 +/- 0.7 versus 35.0 +/- 0.5 g/L), higher 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels (1.26 +/- 0.08 versus 1.05 +/- 0.06 ng/ml), and a lower prevalence of statin treatment (18 versus 36%). Therefore, the median MPO activity was significantly (P < 0.05) lower (17.7 versus 26.6 deltaOD630/min per mg protein) in the subgroup of 31 HD patients with ongoing statin treatment. In a multiple regression model, correction for the impact of age, gender, vintage, serum cholesterol, serum albumin, comorbidity, diabetes, and statin use, only diabetes (P < 0.01) and statin use (P < 0.01) were significantly associated to MPO activity. Fourteen patients who had diabetes and were receiving statin treatment had markedly (P = 0.001) lower median (19.9 versus 41.2 deltaOD630/min per mg protein) MPO activity compared with 18 who had diabetes and were not taking statins. This cross-sectional study suggests that both diabetes and statin treatment affect MPO activity in prevalent HD patients.", 
    "188": "In the third millennium preventive medicine is becoming a corner stone in our concept of health. Colorectal cancer (CRC) fits the criteria of a disease suitable for prevention interventions. It is a prevalent disease that is associated with considerable mortality and morbidity rates, with more than 1,000,000 new cases and 500,000 deaths annually. CRC has a natural history of transition from precursor to malignant lesion that spans, on average, 10-15 years, providing a window of opportunity for effective interventions and prevention. Indeed, CRC is preventable in up to 90% of the cases. Simple life style modifications (balanced diet avoidance of smoking and alcohol, and moderate physical activity) can prevent up to 50% of the cases of colorectal cancer. Compliance with current screening methods is a major barrier to the achievement of optimal results, a large part of the average risk population has not been screened by any method. Several newly developed screening modalities, such as the virtual colonoscopy and stool genetic testing may improve compliance. In addition, chemoprevention, a new science that has emerged during the last decade, presents an alternative approach to reducing mortality from colorectal cancer as well as other cancers. Chemoprevention involves the long-term use of a variety of oral agents that can delay, prevent or even reverse the development of adenomas in the large bowel. In light of the recent evidence of the efficacy of chemoprevention in persons at high risk for CRC cancer, it seems only appropriate to consider similar strategies for the general population.",

Pravastatin, pitavastatin and the internal standard fluvastatin were extracted from plasma with solid-phase extraction columns and eluted with methanol. After drying the organic layer, the residue was reconstituted in mobile phase (acetonitrile:water, 90:10, v/v) and injected onto a reversed-phase C(18) column. The isocratic mobile phase was eluted at 0.2 mL/min. The ion transitions recorded in multiple reaction monitoring mode were m/z 423 --> 101, 420 --> 290 and 410 --> 348 for pravastatin, pitavastatin and fluvastatin, respectively. The coefficient of variation of the assay precision was less than 12.4%, the accuracy exceeded 89%. The limit of detection was 1 ng/mL for all analytes. This method was used to measure the plasma concentration of pitavastatin or pravastatin from healthy subjects after a single 4 mg oral dose of pitavastatin or 40 mg oral dose of pravastatin. This is a very simple, sensitive and accurate analytic method to determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of pitavastatin or pravastatiny.",

With their combined effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts, statins have the potential to enhance resorption of synthetic materials and improve bone ingrowth. In this study, the effect of oral and local administration of simvastatin to a beta tricalcium phosphate (betaTCP)-filled defect around an implant was compared with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2). On hundred and sixty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to treatment groups: local application of 0.1, 0.9 or 1.7 mg of simvastatin, oral simvastatin at 5, 10 or 50 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 20 days, local delivery of 1 or 10 microg of rhBMP2, or control. At 6 weeks rhBMP2 increased serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b levels and reduced betaTCP area fraction, particle size and number compared with control, suggesting increased osteoclast activity. There was reduced stiffness and increased mechanical strength with this treatment. Local simvastatin resulted in a decreased mineral apposition rate at 6 weeks and increased fibrous area fraction, betaTCP area fraction, particle size and number at 26 weeks. Oral simvastatin had no effect compared with control. Local application of rhBMP2 increased resorption and improved mechanical strength whereas simvastatin was detrimental to healing. Oral simvastatin was ineffective at promoting either ceramic resorption or bone formation. The effect of statins on the repair of bone defects with graft substitute materials is influenced by its bioavailability. Thus, further studies on the optimal delivery system are needed.",

On echocardiography, statin treatment had no significant impact on aortic valve stenosis. Patients with serum LDL level >130 mg/dl showed less progression of coronary artery calcification when treated with statin drugs.

Advanced glycosylation end-products (AGE) may play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. We examined the effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (HMGRI) cerivastatin on serum concentration of AGE-CML in patients with elevated fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or DM. The study was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group comparison of cerivastatin at 0.4 mg daily for 12 weeks (n=34) and placebo (n=35). Patients were characterized by combined hyperlipoproteinemia and the preponderance of dense LDL. Primary objective of the study was the effect of cerivastatin on the concentration of dense LDL subfractions. Here we report on the effect of cerivastatin on the concentration of AGE-CML. After 12 weeks of treatment cerivastatin reduced cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, LDL cholesterol and the concentration of dense LDL. Furthermore, cerivastatin significantly lowered the concentration of AGE-CML by 21% ( P=0,005; compared to -7,5% in the placebo group). The effect on AGE-CML was correlated with the reduction in LDL cholesterol (r=0.355, P=0.003) and LDL apoB (r=0.239, P=0.05).

Patients with ICH related to trauma or underlying lesions (e.g. brain tumors, aneurysms, arterio-venous malformations) and of infratentorial location were excluded. The impact of admission blood glucose, coagulopathy, seizures on presentation and prior statin and aspirin use on 30-day mortality and functional outcomes at discharge was assessed using dichotomized Modified Rankin Scale (dMRS) and Glasgow Outcomes scale (dGOS). Other variables known to impact outcomes that were included in the multiple logistic regression analysis were age, admission GCS, pulse pressure, ICH volume, ICH location, volume of IVH and hydrocephalus.", 
    "222": "A total of 314 patients with ICH were identified, 125 met inclusion criteria. Patients' age ranged from 34 to 90 years (mean 63.5), 57.6 % were male. Mean ICH volume was 32.09 cc (range 1-214 cc). Following multiple logistic regression analysis, prior statin use (P = 0.05) was found to be associated with decreased mortality with a greater than 12-fold odds of survival while admission blood glucose (P = 0.023) was associated with increased 30-day mortality. Coagulopathy, seizures on presentation, and prior aspirin use had no significant impact on 30-day mortality or outcomes at discharge in our study cohort.", 
    "223": "The significant association of prior statin use with decreased mortality warrants prospective evaluation of the use of statins following ICH."
