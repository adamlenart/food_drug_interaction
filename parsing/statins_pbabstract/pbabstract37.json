    "0": "Diabetes mellitus and in particular type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the most important risk factors of cardiovascular disease. To influence cardiovascular risk there is enormous important not only positive influence of glycemia, but also the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia and hypertension. The present work provides an analysis of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapy for all diabetics registered with General Health Insurance Company in the period 2010-2013. In this time 866,570 patients with diabetes mellitus registered with General Health Insurance Company were treated, the majority of them were diabetics independent on insulin. Approximately half of the patients were observed by dialectologists and half of them by the doctors of other specialization. Out of antihypertensive medi-cation, patients were most often treated by drugs that affect the renin-angiotensin system, as well as beta-blockers and diuretics. Prescription of the lipid-lowering therapy, especially prescription of statins, in accordance with the guidelines, is increasing, but remains insufficient (at 2013\u202f43.6% diabetics treated by dialectologists and 51.3% diabetics treated by GP\u00b4s didn\u00b4t have lipid lowering therapy). Inadequate use of combination lipid-lowering therapy was recorded too, still represented mainly by combination of statin and fibrate, but in coming years we expect (based on the positive results of the subanalysis IMPROVE-IT study), an increase of combination therapy statin and ezetimibe.", 
    "1": "A meeting of European experts in cardiovascular (CV) disease and lipids was convened in Paris, November 2014, where an important problem of preventive cardiology--residual vascular risk done by atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD)--was discussed. On the basis of discussion have the experts summarised a consensus concerning AD, its CV risk and up to date evidence of combined therapy with statin and fenofibrate on CV risk. Atherogenic dyslipidemia should be the secondary aim of dyslipidemia treatment, because it is a reason of residual vascular risk. Non-HDL-cholesterol should be the secondary target of AD treatment, which is a most unexpensive and easiest marker of residual vascular risk. Combined therapy with statin and fenofibrate is safe, well tolerated and reduces plasma atherogenity and CV events in patients with AD and high CV risk, type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.", 
    "2": "Lipoprotein apheresis (LA) is an effective treatment method the patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, resistant to the standard therapy. LA is an extracorporeal elimination technique, which specifically removes low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from the circulation. At present, lipoprotein apheresis, combined with high-dose statin and ezetimibe therapy, is the best available means of treating patients with homozygous and statin refractory heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). However, the extent of cholesterol-lowering achieved is often insufficient to meet the targets set by current guidelines. The recent advent of new classes of lipid-lowering agents provides new hope that the latter objective may now be achievable. These compounds act either by reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol production by inhibiting apolipoprotein B synthesis with an antisense oligonucleotide (mipomersen), or by inhibiting microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (lomitapid), or by enhancing LDL catabolism via monoclonal antibody-mediated inhibition of the activity of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9-alirocumab, evolocumab etc). The promising is the combination of LDL-apheresis with new drugs, namely for its potential to further decrease of LDL-cholesterol between apheresis. Depending on the outcome of current trials, it seems likely that these compounds, used alone or combined with lipoprotein apheresis, will markedly improve the management of refractory FH.", 
    "3": "At the present time there are novel hypolipidemics registered globally (alirocumab was the first drug of this group in the world registered by an American drug agency FDA) and in Europe, which in many ways differ from the medicines administered until now. They are bringing another advancement in the treatment of disorders of lipid metabolism and in preventive cardiology. Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to PCSK-9 enzyme (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin-9). PCSK-9 enzyme plays an important role in the metabolism of LDL-cholesterol through affecting the breakdown and eventually the amount and activity of LDL-receptors. From the clinical point of view it is essential that drugs from this group are administered parenterally, as a subcutaneous injection. In the case of Praluent\u00ae the interval between administration is two weeks. The dose is then 75 or 150 mg in a 1 ml injection. From the clinical point of view it is particularly important that alirocumab decreases LDL-C concentrations by 50-60%, it decreases Lp/a/ levels by 25-30%, and it also positively influences other components of lipid metabolism and, above all, is very likely to have a potential to decrease a cardiovascular risk. Although the resuIts of morbidity and mortality studies are expected in the coming years, initial analyses strongly indicate a clinically significant reduction of CV events. Alirocumab, Praluent can be administered as monotherapy (mainly to statin-intolerant patients), however it will be primarily administered in combination with the other hypolipidemic drugs (in particular statins) where the effort to reach target values has not succeeded.", 
    "4": "Statins significantly decrease the cardiovascular risk and the reduction of cholesterol by statins has become a milestone in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases for a large group of patients. In spite of that an adequate use of statins in many patients is limited by adverse symptoms which lead to interruption of the therapy in some patients and low adherence to the therapy in others. Therefore the subject of statin intolerance is of great clinical importance. Statin intolerance can be defined as an incidence of myalgia or other adverse symptoms associated with a statin therapy, which lead to its interruption. Nonetheless, even if such symptoms develop during the statin therapy, these adverse effects are frequently not associated with the treatment and most patients with an anamnesis suggesting episodes of such symptoms are able to tolerate an adequate statin therapy. It is therefore of great clinical importance to identify the actual cases of statin intolerance in order to avoid the unnecessary interruption of the statin therapy in the patients who would benefit from it. Regarding patients with a proven statin intolerance, statins should be administered according to an altered scheme and if tolerated, the dose should be gradually increased until the highest tolerated level is reached. When this careful approach is followed, most patients are able to tolerate some level of statin therapy at least. Besides that, there may be also other lipid-reducing drugs needed to reach the required goals. If the achievement of the lipid target values is difficult, a rigorous control of the risk factors may help in reducing the cardiovascular risk.", 
    "5": "Localised controlled release of simvastatin from porous freeze-dried chitosan-gelatin (CH-G) scaffolds was investigated by incorporating simvastatin loaded poly-(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) microparticles (MSIMs) into the scaffolds. MSIMs at 10% w/w simvastatin loading were prepared using a single emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The MSIM optimal amount to be incorporated into the scaffolds was selected by analysing the effect of embedding increasing amounts of blank PLGA microparticles (BL-MPs) on the scaffold physical properties and on the in vitro cell viability using a clonal human osteoblastic cell line (hFOB). Increasing the BL-MP content from 0% to 33.3% w/w showed a significant decrease in swelling degree (from 1245\u00b156% to 570\u00b135%). Scaffold pore size and distribution changed significantly as a function of BL-MP loading. Compressive modulus of scaffolds increased with increasing BL-MP amount up to 16.6% w/w (23.0\u00b11.0kPa). No significant difference in cell viability was observed with increasing BL-MP loading. Based on these results, a content of 16.6% w/w MSIM particles was incorporated successfully in CH-G scaffolds, showing a controlled localised release of simvastatin able to influence the hFOB cell proliferation and the osteoblastic differentiation after 11 days.", 
    "6": "Lack of adherence may explain, at least in part, the poor cardiovascular risk factors control observed in patients with ischemic heart disease, increasing the risk of developing new events. Polypill improves medication adherence, which may actually reduce blood pressure and LDL cholesterol compared with the drugs given separately. The fixed combination of acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg + ramipril 2.5, 5, or 10 mg + either simvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg is the unique cardiovascular polypill that has been registered in 22 countries worldwide. The polypill-containing simvastatin has been specifically tested in a clinical trial including only patients with ischemic heart disease. The FOCUS study showed that patients treated with the polypill showed a higher adherence compared with those receiving separate medications.",

    "8": "By measuring the cytokinin content directly and testing the sensitivity to the cytokinin inhibitor lovastatin, we demonstrated that tasg1 cytokinin metabolism is different from wild-type. Our previous studies have indicated that compared with wild-type (WT) plants, a wheat stay-green mutant tasg1 exhibited delayed senescence. In this study, we found that the root development of tasg1 occurred later than that of WT. The number of lateral roots was fewer, but the lateral root length was longer in tasg1 than in WT, which resulted in a lower root to shoot ratio in tasg1 than WT. The levels of cytokinin (CK), CK activity, and expression of CK metabolic genes were measured. We found that the total CK content in the root tips and leaf of tasg1 was greater than in WT. The accumulation of mRNA of the CK synthetic gene (TaIPT) in tasg1 was higher than in WT at 9 and 11 days during seedling growth, but the expression of CK oxidase gene (TaCKX) was significantly lower in tasg1. Furthermore, the CK inhibitor lovastatin was used to inhibit CK activity. When treated with lovastatin, both the chlorophyll content and thylakoid membrane protein stability were significantly lower in tasg1 than WT, consistent with the inhibited expression of senescence-associated genes (TaSAGs) in tasg1. Lovastatin treatment also inhibited the antioxidative capability of wheat seedlings, and tasg1 was more sensitive to lovastatin than WT, as indicated by the MDA content, protein carbonylation, and antioxidant enzyme activity. The decreased antioxidative capability after lovastatin treatment may be related to the down-regulation of some antioxidase genes. These results suggest that the CK metabolism was altered in tasg1, which may play an important role in its ability to delay senescence.",

Inconsistent findings in the studies have been observed toward the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) using higher dose of statin. To examine this issue, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the association between higher dose of various statins and risk of ICH among patients with CVD. Literature was searched for studies published before June 10, 2015, using electronic database 'PubMed', 'EMBASE', and 'Google Scholar' as well as from many trial databases. The following search terms were used: 'Statin therapy' AND 'Cardiovascular Disease', AND 'Dose' AND 'Intracerebral hemorrhage', AND 'Randomized Controlled Trials' AND 'High Dose Statin'. High dose of statins was defined as atorvastatin 80 mg, simvastatin 80 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, rosuvastatin 20 mg per day. Fixed-effect model was used to estimate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) if heterogeneity was <50%; otherwise, random-effect model was used.

The cornea was used as the model, and some specific aspects of repair in this organ were incorporated into assay design. A quantitative cell-based assay was developed based on transcriptional promoter activity of fibrotic marker genes ACT2A and TGFB2. Immortalized corneal stromal cells (HTK) or corneal epithelial cells (HCLE) were tested and compared to primary corneal stromal cells. Cells were transiently transfected with constructs containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by transcriptional promoters for the selected fibrotic marker genes. A selected panel of seven chemical test compounds was used, containing three known fibrosis inhibitors: lovastatin (LOV), tyrphostin AG 1296 (6,7-dimethoxy-3-phenylquinoxaline) and SB203580 (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)1H-imidazole), and four potential fibrosis inhibitors: 5-iodotubercidin (4-amino-5-iodo-7-(\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl)-pyrrolo(2,3-d)pyrimidine), anisomycin, DRB (5,6-dichloro-1-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl-benzimidazole) and latrunculin B. Transfected cells were treated with TGFB2 in the presence or absence of one of the test compounds. To validate the assay, compounds were tested for their direct effects on gene expression in the immortalized cell lines and primary human corneal keratocytes using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.

In contrast, atorvastatin expanded regulatory T cells (Tregs) and upregulated the expression of T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT), which enhanced the suppressive activity of Tregs. Furthermore, atorvastatin upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which is also known as cip-1 and waf-1, in the CD4 T cells. Upregulation of p21 in CD4 T cells rendered them less susceptible to HIV-1 infection and replication whereas siRNA-mediated p21 depletion and/or p21 selective inhibitor rescued viral replication.

    "43": "The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a combined 14-day treatment with rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) on selected biochemical parameters of oxidative stress in the blood of rats. The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and the total antioxidant status (TAS) were determined. A combined 14-day treatment with rosuvastatin and fluoxetine significantly increases glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activity and decreases the level of TAS. Rosuvastatin administered to rats caused a decrease in the glutathione peroxidase activity and an increase in the glutathione reductase activity but did not affect the level of TAS. A 14-day treatment with fluoxetine exerted practically no effect on the investigated parameters of oxidative stress in rats. The abovementioned changes in the biochemical parameters after the combined treatment with rosuvastatin and fluoxetine may imply an imbalance in prooxidant and antioxidant levels in the combined treatment with rosuvastatin and fluoxetine.",

Starting with the 2013 ACC-AHA cholesterol guidelines extensive evidence base on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) we added references in the past 5 years that discussed statin efficacy and safety over the life span. In those under 40, statins are primarily used for treatment of severe hypercholesterolemia, often familial, and they are well tolerated. In middle-aged adults, statins have strong evidence for benefit in primary and secondary prevention trials; however, in primary prevention, a clinician-patient risk discussion should precede statin prescription in order to determine appropriate treatment. In those over 75, issues of statin intensity and net benefit loom large as associated comorbidity, polypharmacy, and potential for adverse effects impact the decision to use statins with RCT data strongest in support of use in secondary prevention. Statin drugs have been studied by RCTs in a large number of individuals. In those groups shown to benefit, statins have reduced the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with few side effects as compared to controls. This review has detailed considerations that should occur when statins are given to individuals in different age groups.", 
    "49": "We investigated factors affecting the timing of signal detection by comparing variations in reporting time of known and unknown ADRs after initial drug release in the USA. Data on adverse event reactions (AERs) submitted to U.S. FDA was used. Six ADRs associated with 6 drugs (rosuvastatin, aripiprazole, teriparatide, telithromycin, exenatide, varenicline) were investigated: Changes in the proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio, and information component as indexes of signal detection were followed every 3 months after each drugs release, and the time for detection of signals was investigated. The time for the detection of signal to be detected after drug release in the USA was 2-10 months for known ADRs and 19-44 months for unknown ones. The median lag time for known and unknown ADRs was 99.0-122.5 days and 185.5-306.0 days, respectively. When the FDA released advisory information on rare but potentially serious health risks of an unknown ADR, the time lag to report from the onset of ADRs to the FDA was shorter. This study suggested that one factor affecting signal detection time is whether an ADR was known or unknown at release.",

Intensive statin therapy, compared with moderate-dose statin therapy, incrementally lowers LDL-C levels and rates of cardiovascular events in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. Ezetimibe, by diminishing the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine, additionally reduces LDL-C when added to statins. In this article, we discuss the potential benefits of the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe for the long-term management of patients with acute coronary syndrome through an analysis of the IMPROVE-IT results (IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial). This randomised double blind trial included 18,144 patients with a LDL-C of 50 to 100 (with statin) or 125 (without statin) mg/dl and had a median follow-up of 6 years. The objective of the study was to test the efficacy of simvastatin 40 mg versus simvastatin 40 mg and 10 mg ezetimibe. The primary endpoint included cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina and coronary revascularization. The addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin resulted in an incremental lowering of LDL-C (reached value 53.2 versus 69.9 mg/dl, p < 0.001) and a further improvement of the patient prognosis (relative reduction of primary endpoint: -6.4%, p = 0.016). In addition, the combined therapy showed no significant adverse effects, particularly regarding the risk of cancers, which confirms the safety of ezetimibe. In acute coronary syndrome, the prescription of ezetimibe should be considered (class HA, level of evidence B) in patients with a LDL-C a 70 mg/dl despite maximally tolerated dose of statin.",

Antiphospholipid antibodies are among the most common causes of acquired thrombophilia, but unlike most of the genetic thrombophilias are associated with both venous and arterial thrombosis. Despite an abundance of clinical and basic research on aPL, a unified mechanism that explains their prothrombotic activity has not been defined; this may reflect the heterogeneity of aPL and/or the fact that they may influence multiple pro- and/or antithrombotic pathways. Antiphospholipid antibodies are directed primarily toward phospholipid binding proteins rather than phospholipid per se, with the most common antigenic target being \u03b22-glycoprotein 1 (\u03b22GPI) although antibodies against other targets such as prothrombin are well described. Laboratory diagnosis of aPL depends upon the detection of a lupus anticoagulant (LA), which prolongs phospholipid-dependent anticoagulation tests, and/or anticardiolipin and anti-\u03b22-glycoprotein 1 antibodies. Indefinite anticoagulation remains the mainstay of therapy for thrombotic APS, although new strategies that may improve outcomes are emerging. Preliminary reports suggest caution in the use of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with APS-associated thrombosis. Based on somewhat limited evidence, aspirin and low molecular weight heparin are recommended for obstetrical APS. There remains a pressing need for better understanding of the pathogenesis of APS in humans, for identification of clinical and laboratory parameters that define patients at greatest risk for APS-related events, and for targeted treatment of this common yet enigmatic disorder.",

Clinically relevant doses of both drugs showed additive anti-tumor effects in H727, HepG2, Huh7, MPC and MTT cells (P \u2264 0.05), but not in BON1 or GOT cells. In all cell lines investigated, lovastatin inhibited EGFR and AKT signaling. Subsequently, combination treatment more strongly inhibited EGFR and AKT signaling than everolimus alone, or at least attenuated everolimus-induced EGFR or AKT activation. Vice versa, everolimus constantly decreased pp70S6K and combination treatment more strongly decreased pp70S6K than lovastatin alone, or attenuated lovastatin-induced p70S6K activation: in BON1 cells lovastatin-induced EGFR inhibition was least pronounced, possibly explaining the low efficacy and consequent absent additive effect.",

The effective rate of treating HF significantly increased after atorvastatin treatment. The plasma NT-proBNP, IL-6, IL-10, hs-CRP, and LVEDD levels significantly decreased (P < 0.05), while the LVEF and E/A levels significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the observation group compared to the control group and before intervention. The NT-proBNP and cytokine levels significantly differed among patients with different classes of heart function (P < 0.05); the NT-proBNP and cytokine levels increased with the severity of heart function. Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a negative correlation between the NT-proBNP and inflammatory cytokine levels and LVEF and E/A values, and a positive correlation between these factors and LVEDD (P < 0.05). In conclusion, atorvastatin significantly improves cardiac function; the mechanism atorvastatin action was related to the decrease in plasma NT-proBNP and inflammatory cytokine levels.",

In addition, a spray-dried formulation of SVS without LYS was prepared. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) revealed that SLS coated the SVS and SVS-LYS particles upon spray drying. X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that in the spray-dried formulations the remaining crystallinity originated from SLS only. The best dissolution properties and a \"spring and parachute\" effect were found for SVS spray-dried from a 5% SLS solution without LYS. Despite the presence of at least partially crystalline SLS in the mixtures, all the studied formulations were able to significantly extend the stability of amorphous SVS compared to previous co-amorphous formulations of SVS.

    "77": "Microglial activation results in profound morphological, functional and gene expression changes that affect the pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of these cells. Although statins have beneficial effects on inflammation, they have not been thoroughly investigated for their ability to affect microglial functions. Therefore the effects of rosuvastatin, one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in cardiovascular therapy, either alone or in combination with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were profiled in pure microglial cultures derived from the forebrains of 18-day-old rat embryos. To reveal the effects of rosuvastatin on a number of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, we performed morphometric, functional and gene expression studies relating to cell adhesion and proliferation, phagocytosis, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-10, respectively) production, and the expression of various inflammation-related genes, including those related to the above morphological parameters and cellular functions. We found that microglia could be an important therapeutic target of rosuvastatin. In unchallenged (control) microglia, rosuvastatin inhibited proliferation and cell adhesion, but promoted microspike formation and elevated the expression of certain anti-inflammatory genes (Cxcl1, Ccl5, Mbl2), while phagocytosis or pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production were unaffected. Moreover, rosuvastatin markedly inhibited microglial activation in LPS-challenged cells by affecting both their morphology and functions as it inhibited LPS-elicited phagocytosis and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) production, concomitantly increasing the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Finally, rosuvastatin beneficially and differentially affected the expression of a number of inflammation-related genes in LPS-challenged cells by inhibiting numerous pro-inflammatory and stimulating several anti-inflammatory genes. Since the microglia could elicit pro-inflammatory responses leading to neurodegeneration, it is important to attenuate such mechanisms and promote anti-inflammatory properties, and develop prophylactic therapies. By beneficially regulating both pro- and anti-inflammatory microglial functions, rosuvastatin may be considered as a prophylactic agent in the prevention of inflammation-related neurological disorders.",

    "84": "The protective effect of statin on Alzheimer disease (AD) is still controversial, probably due to the debate about when to start the use of statin and the lack of any large-scale randomized evidence that actually supports the hypothesis. The purpose of this study was to examine the protective effect of early statin use on mild-to-moderate AD in the total Taiwanese population.This was a total population-based case-control study, using the total population of Taiwanese citizens seen in general medical practice; therefore, the findings can be applied to the general population. The study patients were those with newly diagnosed dementia (ICD-9 290.x) and prescribed any acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) from the Taiwan National Health Insurance dataset in 1997 to 2008. The newly diagnosed eligible mild-to-moderate AD patients were traced from the dates of their index dates, which was defined as the first day to receive any AChEI treatment, back to 1 year (exposure period) to categorize them into AD with early statin use and without early statin use. Early statin use was defined as patients using statin before AChEI treatment. Alzheimer disease patients with early statin use were those receiving any statin treatment during the exposure period. Then, we used propensity-score-matched strategy to match these 2 groups as 1:1. The matched study patients were followed-up from their index dates. The primary outcome was the discontinuation of AChEI treatment, indicating AD progression.There were 719 mild-to-moderate AD-paired patients with early statin use and without early statin use for analyses. Alzheimer disease progression was statistically lower in AD patients with early statin use than those without (P = 0.00054). After adjusting for other covariates, mild-to-moderate AD patients with early stain use exhibited a 0.85-risk (95% CI = 0.76-0.95, P = 0.0066) to have AD progression than those without.Early statin use was significantly associated with a reduction in AD progression in mild-to-moderate AD patients. The future randomized trial studies can confirm our findings.",

The most enigmatic feature of HR-PKSs is how tailoring domains function selectively during different iterations of chain elongation to afford structural diversity. Using the lovastatin nonaketide synthase LovB as a model system and a variety of acyl substrates, we characterized the substrate specificity of the LovB methyltransferase (MT) domain. We showed that, while the MT domain displays methylation activity toward different \u03b2-ketoacyl groups, it is exceptionally selective toward its naturally programmed \u03b2-keto-dienyltetraketide substrate with respect to both chain length and functionalization. Accompanying characterization of the ketoreductase (KR) domain displays broader substrate specificity toward different \u03b2-ketoacyl groups. Our studies indicate that selective modifications by tailoring domains, such as the MTs, are achieved by higher kinetic efficiency on a particular substrate relative to the rate of transformation by other competing domains.",

These analyses revealed that gene expressions of protein folding chaperones, membrane transporters and extracellular matrices were altered and shifted during liver metamorphosis. HSP90, important in protein folding and invertebrate metamorphosis, was identified as a candidate key factor during liver metamorphosis in sea lamprey. Blocking HSP90 with geldanamycin facilitated liver metamorphosis and decreased the gene expressions of the rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCoA reductase (hmgcr), and bile acid biosynthesis, cyp7a1. Injection of hsp90 siRNA for 4 days altered gene expressions of met, hmgcr, cyp27a1, and slc10a1.

The exposure led to changes in several biochemical parameters, including reduction in cholesterol, triglycerides, cortisol, testosterone, and estradiol. Changes in cholesterol and triglycerides were also associated with changes in transcript levels of key genes involved with cholesterol and lipid regulation, including SREBP2, HMGCR1, PPAR\u03b1, and SREBP1. We also noted higher CYP3A65 and atrogin1 mRNA levels in drug-treated male fish. Sex differences were apparent in some of the examined parameters at both biochemical and molecular levels.

We used low density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR-/-) mice and human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) as model systems to study the effect of SIM on arterial calcification and to explore the potential mechanisms contributing to this protective effect. High-fat diet (HFD) caused the LRLR -/- to develop dyslipidemia, diabetics, atherosclerosis and aortic smooth muscle calcification. SIM, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, a ROS scavenger) and apocynin (APO, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor) did not significantly retard the development of dyslipidemia or diabetic. However, those treatments were still effective in attenuating the HFD-induced atherosclerosis and aortic smooth muscle calcification. These findings suggest that the protective effect of SIM against aortic calcification is not contributed by the cholesterol lowering effect. SIM, NAC and APO were found to attenuate the HFD induced elevation of serum TNF-\u03b1, soluble TNFR1 (sTNFR1), 3-nitro-tyrosine. We hypothesized that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, oxidative stress and TNFR1 played a role in inducing aortic calcification. We used HASMC to investigate the role of TNF-\u03b1, oxidative stress and TNFR1 in inducing aortic calcification and to elucidate the mechanism contributes the protective effect of SIM against aortic calcification. We demonstrated that treating HASMC with TNF-\u03b1 induced cell Ca deposit and result in an increase in ALP, NADPH oxidase activity, NF-kB subunit p65, BMP2, MSX2, and RUNX2 expression. SIM suppressed the TNF-\u03b1 induced activation of NADPH oxidase subunit p47, the above-mentioned bone markers and TNFR1 expression. Furthermore, p65, p47 and TNFR1 siRNAs inhibited the TNF-\u03b1-mediated stimulation of BMP-2, MSX2, RUNX2 expression. SIM, APO, and NAC either partially inhibit or completely block the TNF-\u03b1 induced H2O2 or superoxide production. These results suggest that SIM may, independent of its cholesterol-lowering effect, suppresses the progression of vascular diseases through the inhibition of the inflammation mediators TNF-\u03b1 and TNFR1.",

Results showed that glucose utilization was markedly inhibited by atorvastatin, simvastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin and rifampicin. Neither rosuvastatin nor pravastatin showed the similar effect. Atorvastatin and pravastatin were selected for the following study. Atorvastatin and rifampicin significantly inhibited glucose uptake and down-regulated GLUT2 and GCK expressions. Similarly, overexpressed PXR significantly down-regulated GLUT2 and GCK expressions and impaired glucose utilization. Ketoconazole and resveratrol attenuated the impaired glucose utilization by atorvastatin and rifampicin in both parental and overexpressed PXR cells. PXR knockdown significantly up-regulated GLUT2 and GCK proteins and abolished the decreased glucose consumption and uptake by atorvastatin and rifampicin. Animal experiments showed that atorvastatin and PCN significantly elicited postprandial hyperglycemia, leading to increase in glucose AUC. Expressions of GLUT2 and GCK in rat livers were markedly down-regulated by atorvastatin and PCN. In conclusion, atorvastatin impaired glucose utilization in hepatocytes via repressing GLUT2 and GCK expressions, which may be partly due to PXR activation.", 
    "137": "Imbalanced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity promotes cardiovascular alterations that are attenuated by statins. These drugs exert pleiotropic effects independent of cholesterol concentrations, including upregulation of nitric oxide (NO) formation and MMP downregulation. However, statins also increase tissue concentrations of nitrites, which activate new signaling pathways independent of NO. We examined whether atorvastatin attenuates MMP-9 production by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) by mechanisms possibly involving increased nitrite, and whether this effect results of NO formation. We also examined whether such an effect is improved by sildenafil, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase-5 which potentiates NO-induced increases in cyclic GMP. MMP activity and nitrite concentrations were measured by gelatin zymography and ozone-based reductive chemiluminescence, respectively, in the conditioned medium of HUVECs incubated for 24 h with these drugs. Phospho-NF\u03baB p65 concentrations were measured in cell lysate to assess NF\u03baB activation. Atorvastatin attenuated PMA-induced MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity by mechanisms not involving NO, although it increased nitrite concentrations, whereas sildenafil had no effects. Combining both drugs showed no improved responses compared to atorvastatin alone. While sodium nitrite attenuated MMP-9 production by HUVECs, adding hemoglobin (NO scavenger) did not affect the responses to nitrite. Neither atorvastatin nor nitrite inhibited PMA-induced increases in phospho-NF\u03baB p65 concentrations. These findings show that sodium nitrite attenuates MMP-9 production by endothelial cells and may explain similar effects exerted by atorvastatin. With both drugs, the inhibitory effects on MMP-9 production are not dependent on NO formation or on inhibition of NF\u03baB activation. Our findings may help to elucidate important new nitrite-mediated mechanisms by which statins affect imbalanced MMP activity in a variety of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "138": "Several guidelines and expert recommendations have been published recently regarding the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend a drastic paradigm change in the treatment of cholesterol where treatment, based on level of cardiovascular risk, is based around using a fixed statin intensity therapy. This approach is endorsed by the American Diabetes Association. However, recommendations by the National Lipid Association (NLA) consist of the traditional approach of titrating therapy to achieve patient-specific lipoprotein targets. Despite the differences in overall approaches, the use of statin therapy as the cornerstone of treatment to reduce risk of cardiovascular events in at risk patients is a strong common theme. Clinicians should be aware of these differences, as they represent controversies with the overall treatment of ASCVD risk. Additional controversies related to the treatment of patients with ASCVD risk pertain to the role of nonstatin drugs and approaches to managing side effects. These topics are reviewed within this article and discuss implications for patient care.",

Ezetimibe and nutraceuticals have been introduced as alternative therapies and have proved to be effective and well tolerated. A single-blind, single-center, randomized, prospective, and parallel group trial comparing a combination of nutraceuticals (red yeast rice, policosanol, berberine, folic acid, coenzyme Q10 and astaxanthin), called Armolipid Plus, and ezetimibe for 3 months in terms of efficacy and tolerability. Patients who did not achieve their therapeutic target (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <100 mg/dl) could add the alternative treatment on top of randomized treatment for another 12 months: 100 patients who are dyslipidemic with ischemic heart disease treated with percutaneous coronary intervention were enrolled (ezetimibe n = 50, nutraceutical n = 50). Efficacy (lipid profile) and tolerability (adverse events, transaminases, and creatine kinase) were assessed after 3 and 12 months. After 3 months, 14 patients in the nutraceutical group achieved their therapeutic target, whereas none of the patients in the ezetimibe group did. At 1-year follow-up, 58 patients (72.5%) of the combined therapy group (n = 86) and 14 (100%) of the nutraceutical group reached the therapeutic goal. No patients experienced important undesirable effects. In conclusion, nutraceuticals alone or in combination with ezetimibe are well tolerated and improve the lipid profile in statin-intolerant patients with coronary heart disease. Further studies are needed to assess long-term effects of nutraceuticals on mortality.", 
    "140": "An unobserved random effect is often used to describe the between-study variation that is apparent in meta-analysis datasets. A normally distributed random effect is conventionally used for this purpose. When outliers or other unusual estimates are included in the analysis, the use of alternative random effect distributions has previously been proposed. Instead of adopting the usual hierarchical approach to modelling between-study variation, and so directly modelling the study specific true underling effects, we propose two new marginal distributions for modelling heterogeneous datasets. These two distributions are suggested because numerical integration is not needed to evaluate the likelihood. This makes the computation required when fitting our models much more robust. The properties of the new distributions are described, and the methodology is exemplified by fitting models to four datasets. \u00a9 2015 The Authors.

    "141": "Endocrine therapies target the activation of the oestrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) via distinct mechanisms, but it is not clear whether breast cancer cells can adapt to treatment using drug-specific mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that resistance emerges via drug-specific epigenetic reprogramming. Resistant cells display a spectrum of phenotypical changes with invasive phenotypes evolving in lines resistant to the aromatase inhibitor (AI). Orthogonal genomics analysis of reprogrammed regulatory regions identifies individual drug-induced epigenetic states involving large topologically associating domains (TADs) and the activation of super-enhancers. AI-resistant cells activate endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis (CB) through stable epigenetic activation in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CB sparks the constitutive activation of oestrogen receptors alpha (ER\u03b1) in AI-resistant cells, partly via the biosynthesis of 27-hydroxycholesterol. By targeting CB using statins, ER\u03b1 binding is reduced and cell invasion is prevented. Epigenomic-led stratification can predict resistance to AI in a subset of ER\u03b1-positive patients.", 
    "142": "The objective of this work was to design and characterize liquid and solid self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) for poorly soluble atorvastatin. To optimize the composition of liquid atorvastatin-SEDDS, solubility tests, pseudoternary phase diagrams, emulsification studies and other in vitro examinations (thermodynamic stability, droplet size and zeta potential analysis) were performed. Due to the disadvantages of liquid SEDDS (few choices for dosage forms, low stability and portability during the manufacturing process), attempts were also made to obtain solid SEDDS. Solid SEDDS were successfully obtained using the spray drying technique from two optimized liquid formulations, CF3 and OF2. Despite liquid SEDDS formulation, CF3 was characterized by lower turbidity, higher percentage transmittance and better self-emulsifying properties, and based on the in vitro dissolution study it can be concluded that better solubilization properties were exhibited by solid formulation OF2. Overall, the studies demonstrated the possibility of formulating liquid and solid SEEDS as promising carriers of atorvastatin. SEDDS, with their unique solubilization properties, provide the opportunity to deliver lipophilic drugs to the gastrointestinal tract in a solubilized state, avoiding dissolution-a restricting factor in absorption rate of BCS Class 2 drugs, including atorvastatin.", 
    "143": "Statins are known to display benefits in various diseases independently from their cholesterol lowering properties. In this study, we investigated the acute effects of atorvastatin on vascular reactivity to various spasmogens in isolated rat aorta. The responses to noradrenaline (NA, 10(-8) -10(-4) m), endothelin-1 (ET-1, 10(-10) -10(-7) m), and potassium chloride (KCl, 10-100 mm) were evaluated in aortic rings pretreated with atorvastatin (10(-7) -10(-4) m, 30 min). To verify the mechanism of action, the effects of atorvastatin were studied in the presence of cholesterol precursor, mevalonate (10(-2) m, 45 min), mevalonate-derived isoprenoids, namely geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP, 5 \u00d7 10(-6) m, 30 min) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP, 5 \u00d7 10(-6) m, 30 min), and in the absence of endothelium. In parallel, aortic rings were pretreated with the specific inhibitor of Rho kinase, Y-27632 (10(-7) -10(-6) m). Atorvastatin significantly and concentration-dependently reduced the contractions to spasmogens in rat aorta. This acute inhibitory effect was also evident in endothelium-denuded rings. Pretreatment with mevalonate and GGPP, but not with FPP, reversed the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin (10(-4) m) on NA and ET-1 induced contractions. Similar to atorvastatin, pretreatment with Y-27632 inhibited the contractions to NA and KCl in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed that both atorvastatin (10(-4) m) and Y-27632 (10(-6) m) pretreatment inhibited the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit-1 (MYPT-1) triggered by NA, indicating an inhibitory influence on myosin phosphatase. In conclusion, atorvastatin displayed an acute inhibitory effect on vascular contractility evoked by various spasmogens and the inhibitory effect was possibly mediated by the inhibition of mevalonate and GGPP synthesis as well as the prevention of MYPT-1 phosphorylation induced by Rho/Rho kinase.",

Dyslipidemia commonly exists as a comorbidity factor in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Use of statins is however associated with side effects which at times are so disabling as to interfere with activities of daily living. There are various ways of dealing with this, including use of more water-soluble varieties, intermittent dosing, or use of statin alternatives. Of late, use of co-enzyme Q10 has become acceptable for the muscle side effects.

The Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis study (NCT00092677) enrolled 1,873 patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis and no history of diabetes, coronary heart disease, or other serious co-morbidities were randomized (1:1) to double-blind 40 mg simvastatin plus 10 mg ezetimibe versus placebo. The primary end point in this substudy was incident cataract. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to analyze: (1) if the active treatment reduced the risk of the primary end point and (2) if time-varying low-density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol lowering (annually assessed) was associated with less incident cataract per se. During an average follow-up of 4.3 years, 65 patients (3.5%) developed cataract. Mean age at baseline was 68 years and 39% were women. In Cox multivariate analysis adjusted for age, gender, prednisolone treatment, smoking, baseline LDL cholesterol and high sensitivity C-reactive protein; simvastatin plus ezetimibe versus placebo was associated with 44% lower risk of cataract development (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.96, p = 0.034). In a parallel analysis substituting time-varying LDL-cholesterol with randomized treatment, lower intreatment LDL-cholesterol was in itself associated with lower risk of incident cataract (hazard ratio 0.78 per 1 mmol/ml lower total cholesterol, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.93, p = 0.008). In conclusion, randomized treatment with simvastatin plus ezetimibe was associated with a 44% lower risk of incident cataract development. This effect should perhaps be considered in the risk-benefit ratio of statin treatment.", 
    "187": "Statin pretreatment has been reported to have a cardioprotective effect in patients undergoing elective or urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, data on patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI are still controversial. We prospectively evaluated the effect of long-term statin therapy on infarct size (IS), myocardial salvage index (MSI), and microvascular obstruction (MVO) in consecutive patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI. Two-hundred thirty patients with STEMI (mean age 61 \u00b1 11 years, 183 men) who underwent primary PCI were evaluated with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging during hospitalization (median 4 days after primary PCI). In all patients, we measured peak troponin I level, whereas IS, MSI, and MVO were determined by CMR. Fifty patients (22%) were on long-term statin therapy and showed a significantly lower troponin I peak value compared to patients without previous statins (54 \u00b1 47 vs 88 \u00b1 106 ng/ml; p = 0.02). At CMR evaluation, IS related to the index event was significantly smaller (12.5 \u00b1 11.5 vs 18.5 \u00b1 18.5 g, p = 0.05), and MSI was higher (0.68 \u00b1 0.25 vs 0.52 \u00b1 0.30; p <0.01) in patients with previous statin therapy. MVO was also less frequent (10% vs 20%; p = 0.14) in this group. At multivariate analysis, previous statin therapy remained significantly associated with IS and MSI (p = 0.05 and 0.02, respectively). In conclusion, this study suggests that long-term statin therapy before primary PCI in patients with STEMI is associated with smaller IS and higher MSI. Future studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to investigate potential clinical implications.",

There are several treatment methods for CVD and associated complications that have been considered till now. The current treatment methods cannot produce rapid cure, but could prevent or reduce the progression of this devastating disease. In the current article, we have summarized the use of various pharmacological agents viz. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), antihypertensive, thrombolytic and anticoagulation agents that are currently being used for the management of CVD which targets different biochemical or molecular events. Based on our article, more research in this field is advocated which will provide the rapid and effective treatment methods in order to avoid fatal complications associated with CVD.",

A random-effects model (using the DerSimonian-Laird method) and the generic inverse variance method were used to examine the effect of evacetrapib on plasma lipid concentrations. The safety of evacetrapib was assessed by comparing the pooled incidence of adverse events (total adverse events, adverse events leading to study discontinuation, elevations in hepatic and muscular enzymes and blood pressure) between treatment and placebo groups.

Evacetrapib had no significant effect on plasma triglycerides (WMD: -2.97%, 95% CI: -8.63, +2.69, p = 0.303) concentrations. The effects of evacetrapib on all three lipid indices (LDL-C, HDL-C and triglycerides) did not differ between subsets of trials administering evacetrapib as monotherapy or as add-on to statin therapy. Meta-regression suggested a dose-dependent effect of evacetrapib on plasma LDL-C and HDL-C, but not triglycerides concentrations. Meta-analysis suggested equivalent rates of adverse events in subjects receiving evacetrapib and placebo.",

Also, ezetimibe is not usually known to potentiate statin-induced myopathy. We report a case of myalgia with elevated serum creatinine phosphokinase in a patient after 2 months of therapy with fixed dose combination of atorvastatin and ezetimibe (10 mg each). At the time of the event, patient was undertaking moderate physical exertion in the form of brisk walking for 30-40 min a day and was detected to have low serum Vitamin D levels. The adverse event resolved after stopping atorvastatin-ezetimibe combination therapy. Potential risk factors, such as physical exertion and Vitamin D deficiency, co-existent in dyslipidemic patients, may exacerbate myopathy potential of these drugs, and precipitate muscular symptoms even at a low-dose.",

The prevalence of dyslipidemia had decreased over the past 30 years, which may in part be explained by the steady increase in the use of lipid-lowering drug therapy, especially statins. Cardiovascular risk has been shown to be greater in liver disease (20% in the liver cirrhosis vs. 12% in the general population), where statins can play an important role as a primary and secondary prevention for CAD. Given patients with chronic liver disease, especially liver cirrhosis are at risk of decreased hepatic clearance, there is concern that this patient population may be at higher risk for complications from statin therapy. Several retrospective studies showed that statin use in chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is safe, and even it was associated with lower mortality and lower rate of hepatic decompensation. This review discusses the safety and the different mechanisms where statins can decrease the rate of complications in liver cirrhosis, including portal hypertension, sepsis and the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma.",

'For the recognition of APS': the assessment of aPL profile is crucial for risk stratification; lupus anticoagulant positivity, especially in the context of 'triple aPL positivity' displays the highest risk; a panel of criteria and noncriteria aPL tests may help better risk-stratify the aPL-positive in the future. 'For the management of APS': direct oral anticoagulants are not currently recommended; statins ameliorate the proinflammator/thrombotic markers, whereas hydroxychloroquine reduces the risk of thrombosis in experimental models and lupus patients, which justify their use as an adjunctive treatment in refractory cases; B-cell inhibition may have a role in difficult-to-treat patients with hematologic and microthrombotic/angiopathic manifestations; and complement and mammalian targets of rapamycin complex pathway inhibition are promising targets in APS.",

We have recently demonstrated that the pleiotropic effects of statins are partly mediated through up-regulation of small GTP-binding protein dissociation stimulator (SmgGDS) with a resultant Rac1 degradation and reduced oxidative stress. However, it remains to be elucidated what molecular mechanisms are involved.", 
    "211": "To first determine in what tissue statins up-regulate SmgGDS expression, we examined the effects of two statins (atorvastatin 10 mg/kg per day and pravastatin 50 mg/kg per day for 1 week) on SmgGDS expression in mice in vivo. The two statins increased SmgGDS expression especially in the aorta. Atorvastatin also increased SmgGDS expression in cultured human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human aortic endothelial cells, but not in human aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, Akt phosphorylation was transiently enhanced only in HUVEC in response to atorvastatin. Then, to examine whether Akt is involved for up-regulation of SmgGDS by statins, we knocked out Akt1 by its siRNA in HUVEC, which abolished the effects by atorvastatin to up-regulate SmgGDS. Furthermore, when we knocked down \u03b21-integrin to elucidate the upstream molecule of Akt1, the effect of atorvastatin to up-regulate SmgGDS was abolished. Finally, we confirmed that Akt activator, SC79, significantly up-regulate SmgGDS in HUVEC.",
