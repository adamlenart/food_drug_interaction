In clinical trials a similar proportion of patients randomized to statins and placebo treated developed abnormal liver tests. However, idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a rare adverse reaction and clinical trials are underpowered to detect uncommon side effects. Although probably very rare, idiosyncratic DILI due to statins has been reported among other drugs in all major prospective and retrospective series on DILI. A summary of 40 cases of statin hepatoxicity has been published and, a series of 76 cases suspected statin induced liver injury has recently been published. In the last mentioned series, three patients died and/or underwent liver transplantation and three cases had a rechallenge with the same statin which produced a similar pattern of liver injury. Statin therapy appears to be safe in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in compensated patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. Statins have also been shown to have an inhibitory effect on hepatitis C virus replication in vitro. Retrospective data as well as data from a recent randomized controlled trial suggest that statin therapy might be a useful adjunct to standard combination antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Statin therapy seems to be related to a reduced risk for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with chronic liver disease, but randomized data are lacking.",

Every increase by 1\u00a0ng/mL in the plasma concentration of D-dimer was related to a mean 1-year increase of 0.0062\u00a0mm in the AAA growth. Likewise, CRF increased the 1-year prospective AAA growth by a mean of 2.95\u00a0mm. When we assessed AAA growth as a dichotomic variable, the increase in the peripheral concentrations of PAP slightly increased the risk of AAA expansion (odds ratio [OR]: 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.02), but the presence of CRF increased the risk dramatically (OR: 14,523.62; 95% CI: 0-7.39E+40).",

    "19": "Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors with activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are highly responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) including gefitinib and erlotinib, development of acquired resistance is almost inevitable. Statins show antitumor activity, but it is unknown whether they can reverse EGFR-TKIs resistance in NSCLC with the T790M mutation of EGFR. This study investigated overcoming resistance to EGFR-TKI using simvastatin. We demonstrated that addition of simvastatin to gefitinib enhanced caspase-dependent apoptosis in T790M mutant NSCLC cells. Simvastatin also strongly inhibited AKT activation, leading to suppression of \u03b2-catenin activity and the expression of its targets, survivin and cyclin D1. Both insulin treatment and AKT overexpression markedly increased p-\u03b2-catenin and survivin levels, even in the presence of gefitinib and simvastatin. However, inhibition of AKT by siRNA or LY294002 treatment decreased p-\u03b2-catenin and survivin levels. To determine the role of survivin in simvastatin-induced apoptosis of gefitinib-resistant NSCLC, we showed that the proportion of apoptotic cells following treatment with survivin siRNA and the gefitinib-simvastatin combination was greater than the theoretical additive effects, whereas survivin up-regulation could confer protection against gefitinib and simvastatin-induced apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in erlotinib and simvastatin-treated HCC827/ER cells. These findings suggest that survivin is a key molecule that renders T790M mutant NSCLC cells resistant to apoptosis induced by EGFR-TKIs and simvastatin. Overall, these data indicate that simvastatin may overcome EGFR-TKI resistance in T790M mutant NSCLCs via an AKT/\u03b2-catenin signaling-dependent down-regulation of survivin and apoptosis induction.",

The liver-specific OATPs are increasingly recognized as playing important roles in the pharmacokinetic (PK) of many drugs and thus, involved in the clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs). However, the evaluation of the specific roles of individual OATPs in hepatocytes is challenging because of the lack of selective inhibitors and probe substrates for each OATP member. In the present study, the uptake activity of OATP1B3 was examined in human hepatocytes cultured up to 14 days using an in vitro uptake assay. The results showed that OATP-mediated uptake of rosuvastatin, a substrate for OATPs declined substantially in cultured human hepatocytes. In contrast, the uptake of OATP1B3-selective substrate telmisartan was not measureable at earlier culture periods, but became detectable on Day 7 and showed culture duration-dependent changes from Day 7 to 14. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses illustrated that the OATP functional change was not correlated with messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression alteration in hepatocytes cultured for 3 hours or 7 days. The OATP1B3-mediated telmisartan uptake was also culture medium- and donor-dependent, and only observed in 3 of 5 lots of hepatocytes cultured in 2 of 3 media tested. These results show that using human hepatocytes cultured in certain conditions may provide an excellent addition to transfected cell lines as a way to distinguish OATP1B3 from other hepatic OATP family members, such as OATP1B1, to provide more understanding of OATP-mediated clinical DDI.", 
    "43": "Direct assessment of the vascular lesions of model animals in vivo is important for the development of new antiatherosclerotic drugs. Nevertheless, biochemical analysis of the lipid profile in blood in vitro remains the most common way to evaluate the therapeutic effect of drugs targeting atherosclerosis because of an inherent difficulty to access the vascular wall. Using hypercholesterolemic zebrafish, we present an orchestrated application of Raman spectral measurements and confocal fluorescence imaging to interrogate the pharmacological response of atherosclerotic lesions in situ and in vivo. For demonstration, we investigated two commonly prescribed antihyperlipidemic drugs, ezetimibe and atorvastatin. The treatment of ezetimibe or atorvastatin alone decreased effectively the deposition of lipids in the vascular wall, and a combined dose showed a synergistic effect. Atorvastatin exerted a profound antioxidative effect on vascular fatty lesions. Analysis of individual lesions shows further that these lesions exhibited a heterogeneous response to the treatment of atorvastatin; a significant fraction of, but not all, the lesions became nonoxidized after the intervention. Beyond its efficacies in suppressing both the accumulation and oxidation of vascular lipids, atorvastatin expedited the clearance of vascular lipids. The possession of pleotropic (multiple) therapeutic effects on vascular fatty lesions of hypercholesterolemic zebrafish by atorvastatin is notably consistent with the known pharmaceutical effects of this drug on human beings. These results improve our understanding of the antiatherosclerotic effect of drugs. We envisage that our approach has the potential to become a platform to predict the pharmaceutical effects of new drugs aiming to cure human atherosclerotic diseases.",

They were separated into three groups: control, untreated hyperlipidemia based on temporally screening, and hyperlipidemia with current anti-hyperlipidemic (statins and fibrates) treatment. Triglyceride levels of untreated hyperlipidemia dogs were significantly higher than those of control dogs. ALT levels of hyperlipidemic dogs with treatment were the highest among three groups. VLDL and LDL of both cholesterol and triglyceride of untreated hyperlipidemia dogs were the highest among three groups. HDL1 levels in triglyceride of hyperlipidemia dogs with treatment were significantly higher than those of control and untreated hyperlipidemia dog. Malondialdehyde concentrations of untreated hyperlipidemia dogs were significantly higher than those of control and hyperlipidemic dogs with treatment.",

Anti-hyperlipidemics (statins and fibrates) for dogs are also effective in relieving elevated levels of lipids and lipid oxidation. Plasma lipid (triglyceride and cholesterol) profiles and malondialdehyde are useful diagnostic tools for identifying early stages of untreatment hyperlipidemia in dogs.",

Ezetimibe: Moderate SOE from 11 trials favors mid-potency statin with ezetimibe for lowering LDL-c, with reduction up to 18 percent more compared to high-potency statin monotherapy among general populations. Low SOE from 11 trials favors mid-potency statin with ezetimibe for raising HDL-c, with increase up to 6 percent more compared to high-potency statin monotherapy. Fibrates: There is insufficient evidence to compare combination therapy with fibrate and statin to intensification of statin monotherapy regardless of statin potency. Niacin: There is insufficient evidence to compare combination therapy with niacin and statin to intensification of statin monotherapy on lowering LDL-c, regardless of statin potency.

In a mouse model of preterm labor (PTL) induced by intravaginal administration of a subclinical dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we previously demonstrated that LPS ascends to the cervix, inducing complement activation, cervical remodeling and PTL. Here we show that complement activation also plays a role in myometrial contractions during PTL in this model. Increased levels of C5a were detected in the myometrium of LPS-treated mice but not in age-matched control or term myometrium. Human and mouse myometrium incubated with C5a showed increased frequency of contractions and expression of connexin 43, suggesting that C5a is an uterotonic molecule. Statins, which showed beneficial effects in preventing complement-mediated pregnancy complications, prevented cervical remodeling, myometrial contractions and PTL in the LPS model. The protective effects of statins in PTL were associated with increased synthesis, expression and activity of heme oxygenase (HO-1) in myometrium and cervix. Coadministration of HO-1 inhibitor tin-protoporphyrin-IX with pravastatin abrogated the protective effects of pravastatin on cervical remodeling and myometrial contractions leading to PTB. In addition, pravastatin inhibited complement activation in the cervix by increasing the synthesis and expression of complement inhibitor decay-accelerating factor. This study in mice suggests that statins might be useful to prevent PTL in humans. Clinical trials in humans are needed and if these results are confirmed, they may form the basis for a new clinical approach to prevent PTB.",

Here, we will review one of the most efficient classes of drugs indicated for management of cardiovascular disease (CVD), statins. We will assess their pleiotropic effects that emerged from CVD applications, focusing this review specifically on plausible antimicrobial activity.

In univariate analyses, hypothyroidism was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome of CV death or HF hospitalization (hazard ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.07 to 1.57; p = 0.008), as well as all-cause death (HR: 1.36; 95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.76; p = 0.004).

Porcine iPSC, derived here from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, have a prolonged S phase and are highly sensitive to drugs normally used for synchronization. However, a double-blocking procedure with 0.3 \u03bcM aphidicolin for 10 h followed by 20 ng/ml nocodazole for 4 h arrested 94.3% of the cells at G2/M and, after release from the block, provided 70.1% cells in the subsequent G1 phase without causing any significant loss of cell viability or pluripotent phenotype. Nuclei from different cell cycle stages were used as donors for NT to in vitro-matured metaphase II oocytes. G2/M nuclei were more efficient than either G1 and S stage nuclei in undergoing first cleavage and in producing blastocysts, but all groups had a high incidence of chromosomal/nuclear abnormalities at 2 h and 6 h compared with non-synchronized NT controls from fetal fibroblasts. Many G2 embryos extruded a pseudo-second polar body soon after NT and, at blastocyst, tended to be either polyploid or diploid. By contrast, the few G1 blastocysts that developed were usually mosaic or aneuploid. The poor developmental potential of G1 nuclei may relate to lack of a G1/S check point, as the cells become active in DNA synthesis shortly after exit from mitosis. Together, these data provide at least a partial explanation for the almost complete failure to produce cloned piglets from piPSC.",

To obtain a valid causal estimate, we must impose several assumptions. One of these is the correct specification of the structural model. Building on Pan's work (2001, Biometrics 57, 120-125) on developing a model selection criterion for generalized estimating equations, we propose a new approach for model selection of SMMs based on a quasi-likelihood. We provide a formal model selection criterion that is an extension of Akaike's information criterion. Using subset selection of baseline covariates, our method allows us to understand whether the treatment effect varies across the available baseline covariate levels, and/or to quantify the treatment effect on a specific covariates level to target specific individuals to maximize treatment benefit. We present simulation results in which our method performs reasonably well compared to other testing methods in terms of both the probability of selecting the correct model and the predictive performances of the individual treatment effects. We use a large randomized clinical trial of pravastatin as a motivation.", 
    "95": "There is robust epidemiological evidence dating back to the original Framingham Heart Study from 1977 that indicates an important inverse relationship between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and risk of incident coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite this body of scientific information demonstrating that low levels of HDL-C are an independent predictor of subsequent CAD events, multiple therapeutic attempts to raise HDL-C levels have failed to demonstrate a consistent reduction in prognostically important endpoints such as death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Recently, several major randomized trials using different therapeutic interventions have raised appropriate concerns about our basic understanding of HDL-C and whether the \"HDL hypothesis\" of lowering cardiovascular events through therapeutic interventions directed at raising HDL-C is a scientifically viable one. While two recent randomized controlled trials (AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE) failed to show a reduction in cardiovascular events in patients treated to optimally low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at baseline with extended-release niacin on a background of simvastatin, these clinical trials studied specific populations of stable ischemic heart disease patients. The data from these two contemporary trials cannot be extrapolated to all patient populations, such as those with acute coronary syndromes or myocardial infarction or those with significant residual mixed dyslipidemia not treated with optimal doses of intensive statin therapy, as these patients were excluded by trial design in both studies. Therefore, at the present time, there is insufficient evidence from clinical trials to recommend HDL-targeted therapy for additional event reduction in CAD patients. However, we will review the relevant data from recent major trials (AIM-HIGH, HPS2-THRIVE, ILLUMINATE, and dal-OUTCOMES) and highlight the potential clinical implications of these trials in modern pharmacotherapy as it relates to HDL-C raising and potential cardiovascular event reduction.",

Ten years of statin treatment for 10,000 55-year-old women with high cholesterol (10-year CHD risk, 7.5%) was projected to prevent 32 myocardial infarctions, cause 70 cases of statin-induced myopathy, and add 1108 years to total life expectancy. Measuring CAC and targeting statin treatment to the 2500 women with CAC>0 would provide 45% of the benefit (+501 life-years), but CAC measurement would cost $2.25 million and cause 9 radiation-induced cancers. Treat all was preferable to CAC screening in this scenario and across a broad range of other scenarios (CHD risk, 2.5%-15%) when statin assumptions were favorable ($0.13 per pill and no quality of life penalty). When statin assumptions were less favorable ($1.00 per pill and disutility=0.00384), CAC screening with statin treatment for persons with CAC>0 was cost-effective (<$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year) in this scenario, in 55-year-old men with CHD risk 7.5%, and in other intermediate risk scenarios (CHD risk, 5%-10%).

    "99": "Anacetrapib is a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor currently in Phase III of development as a treatment for those with dyslipidemia and the risk of cardiovascular disease. The agent acts by inhibiting the CETP, which mediates the transfer of cholesterol esters from high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to other lipoproteins. HDL-C has been inversely linked to cardiac risk and is thus a potential target for decreasing residual cardiovascular risk, which remains despite aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol therapy with statin drugs. Anacetrapib has been shown to raise HDL-C by up to 138% and decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by up to 39% compared with placebo. The HDL-C molecules treated with anacetrapib have also been shown to retain their function in cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport and their anti-inflammatory properties. Unlike the previously tested CETP inhibitor torcetrapib, anacetrapib has not been shown to elevate blood pressure, alter electrolytes, or cause any significant side effects. Future studies will determine whether these alterations in the lipid profile decrease the cardiovascular risk of morbidity and mortality. If these studies show promising results, anacetrapib could become a vital pharmacologic therapy for decreasing cardiovascular risk in patients.",

Recent USA guidelines recommend statin therapy without specific targets for the LDL cholesterol level.

We evaluated the relationship of lipid profiles with depression and anxiety symptoms and the effects of 12-weeks of therapy with fluvastatin and omega-3 ethyl esters (n-3 PUFA) in a randomised pilot study of CHC prior non-responders. Participants (n\u2009=\u200960) had fasting lipid profiles and assessment of depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire at each study visit. At screening 26/60 (43 %) had HADS-A score \u22658 and 13/60 (22 %) had HADS-D scores \u22658. Depressed patients had significantly lower apolipoprotein-E concentrations (30 mg/l vs 39 mg/l, P\u2009=\u20090.029) than those without depression and a tendency toward lower total cholesterol (3.8 vs 4.4 mmol/l, P\u2009=\u20090.053). 3 patients discontinued lipid-modifying treatment because of worsening depression. However, there was a small but significant improvement in anxiety symptoms after 12-weeks of high-dose (2-4 g daily) n-3 PUFA. In conclusion, depression in CHC is associated with plasma apoE deficiency. We postulate that apoE deficiency disrupts blood brain barrier integrity to promote HCV infection of the CNS. High-dose n-PUFAs may alleviate anxiety in some CHC patients but the use of lipid lowering therapy must be balanced against risks of worsening depression.",

Circulating PCSK9 status is an important determinant of LDL-cholesterol levels and is thus implicated in atherogenesis. The present study aimed to resolve inconsistencies in clinical findings on the impact of fibrate therapy on circulating PCSK9 concentrations using a meta-analysis of all published studies. A comprehensive literature search in Medline and Scopus was carried out to identify clinical reports on the impact of treatment with fibrates on circulating concentrations of PCSK9. A meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed using a random-effects model. A weighed mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the magnitude of fibrates' effect on PCSK9 concentrations. Six studies comprising 218 subjects fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included for systematic review and quantitative data synthesis. A meta-analysis indicated a significant elevation of circulating PCSK9 concentrations following fibrate therapy (WMD: +60.37; 95% CI: 11.04-109.71; P = 0.02). The PCSK9-elevating effect of fibrates remained significant after comparison with a control group receiving either placebo or a statin (WMD: +23.97; 95% CI: 5.68-42.26; P = 0.01). Meta-regression analysis indicated that the effect size of fibrates in modulating circulating PCSK9 levels is not dependent on the duration of treatment (point estimate for slope = 0.59, SE = 4.56; 95% CI = -8.34 to 9.53; z = 0.130, P = 0.897). Fibrate therapy is associated with a significant increase in circulating PCSK9 concentrations. Such a PCSK9 elevation may partly explain the modest efficacy of fibrates on LDL-C.",

We investigated the relationship between pulmonary artery systolic pressure measured by echocardiography and plasma aminothiol oxidative stress markers, with the hypothesis that oxidative stress will be higher in those with pulmonary hypertension. A group of 347 patients aged 65\u00b112 years from the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank underwent echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction and pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Plasma aminothiols, cysteine, its oxidized form, cystine, glutathione, and its oxidized disulphide were measured and the redox potentials (Eh) of cysteine/cystine and glutathione/oxidized glutathione couples were calculated. Non-normally distributed variables were log transformed (Ln). Univariate predictors of pulmonary artery systolic pressure included age (P<0.001), sex (P=0.002), mitral regurgitation (P<0.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (P<0.001), left atrial size (P<0.001), diabetes mellitus (P=0.03), plasma Ln cystine (\u03b2=9.53; P<0.001), Ln glutathione (\u03b2=-5.4; P=0.002), and Eh glutathione (\u03b2=0.21; P=0.001). A multivariate linear regression model adjusting for all confounding variables demonstrated that Ln cystine (\u03b2=6.56; P=0.007), mitral regurgitation (\u03b2=4.52; P<0.001), statin use (\u03b2=-3.39; P=0.03), left ventricular ejection fraction (\u03b2=-0.26; P=0.003), and age (\u03b2=0.17; P=0.003) were independent predictors of pulmonary artery systolic pressure. For each 1% increase in plasma cystine, pulmonary artery systolic pressure increased by 16%. This association persisted in the subgroup with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (\u226550%) and no significant mitral regurgitation. Whether treatment of oxidative stress will improve pulmonary hypertension requires further study.", 
    "132": "On the basis of large cardiovascular clinical trials of lipid-lowering agents that showed a considerable decrease in the incidence of primary melanomas in the active agent arm, we have carried out a randomized, double-blind clinical trial examining the impact of lovastatin on various biomarkers of melanoma pathogenesis. Subjects with at least two clinically atypical nevi were randomized to receive oral lovastatin or placebo for a 6-month period. Clinical, histopathologic, and molecular biomarkers were evaluated for change in the two groups. Eighty subjects were randomized, evaluable, and included in the analyses. Lovastatin showed no benefit in comparison with placebo in the primary endpoint of decreasing the level of histopathologic atypia, nor in any of the secondary endpoints of decreasing clinical atypia, impact on nevus number, nor in showing significant changes in any of the molecular biomarkers. There were no significant differences in adverse event profiles for lovastatin compared with placebo. The lovastatin arm did show a significant and considerable decrease in total serum cholesterol and serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels compared with placebo, an expected result. This finding bolsters confidence in subject compliance. Given the results of this trial, it is concluded that if lovastatin were to lower the incidence of melanoma, it would appear not to be doing so by reversing atypia of precursor atypical nevi over the 6-month time frame studied. Further research into the pathogenesis of melanoma and in other potential chemopreventive agents is needed.", 
    "133": "Monoterpenes are naturally occurring plant hydrocarbons with multiple effects on the mevalonate pathway (MP), while statins competitively inhibit hydroxymethylglutarylcoenzyme-A reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the MP. Monoterpenes and statins proved capable of inhibiting both proliferation and cholesterogenesis. In the present study we assess the in vitro antiproliferative and anticholesterogenic effects of two monoterpenes: linalool and 1,8-cineole-either alone, in combination with each other, or combined individually with simvastatin-on liver-derived (HepG2) and extrahepatic (A549) cell lines. The three compounds alone inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent fashion, while their pairwise combination produced synergistic antiproliferative effects in both cell lines. Incorporation experiments with [(14)C]acetate revealed that linalool and 1,8-cineole inhibited the MP, probably at different points, resulting in a reduction in cholesterogenesis and an accumulation of other MP intermediates and products. Linalool or 1,8-cineole, either together or individually with simvastatin, synergistically inhibited cholesterol synthesis. At low concentrations both monoterpenes inhibited steps specifically involved in cholesterol synthesis, whereas at higher concentrations HMGCR levels became down-regulated. Added exogenous mevalonate failed to reverse the inhibition of proliferation exerted by linalool and 1,8-cineole, suggesting that HMGCR inhibition alone is not responsible for the antiproliferative activity of those agents. This work demonstrates that monoterpenes in combination with each other, or individually in combination with simvastatin synergistically inhibits proliferation and cholesterogenesis in the human cell lines investigated, thus contributing to a clearer understanding of the action of essential-oil components, and their combination with the statins, in the targeting of specific points within a complex metabolic pathway.",

Profound positive correlations were verified between the decline in long-term memory activity and the restoration of M1/4 receptors in different brain regions after simvastatin treatment.",

Current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend immediate initiation of drugs in adjunct to lifestyle intervention in these patients at high or very high cardiovascular risk. In these clinical settings, statins are generally chosen as the first-choice drug intervention, in consideration of the robust evidence showing a reduction in all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiac events (MACE). In contrast, primary prevention with statins, even in the subset of patients at high-risk of cardiovascular events, is not well implemented. This might be related to a lack of public awareness regarding the actual risk associated with prolonged exposure to high concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and uncertainties in the clinical evidence coming from the earliest trials in this patient subset. However, recent observational studies suggest that lowering LDL-C earlier in life and for a longer duration can substantially decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Moreover, results from recent well-conducted large meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials showed that primary prevention with statins reduced all-cause mortality by 14% and MACE by > 20% - findings similar to those observed for the use of statins in secondary prevention. Recently published American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol emphasize that primary prevention using high-dose statins in individuals with LDL-C \u2265 190 mg/dL induces a benefit in atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk reduction that clearly exceeds the potential for adverse effects. We aim in this review to discuss the new data that advocate the use of statins in primary prevention earlier and more frequently, putting the efficacy evidence into perspective with new insights in terms of safety issues.",

Statins are the most widely used and promising agents in treating CVD and are renowned for their pleiotropic lipid-lowering independent effects. Statins exert their anti-inflammatory effects on the vascular wall through a variety of molecular pathways of the innate and adaptive immune systems, their impact on\u00a0the circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and their effect on adhesion molecules. By inhibiting the mevalonate pathway and isoprenoid formation, statins account for the increase of nitric oxide bioavailability and the improvement of vascular and myocardial redox state by multiple different mechanisms (directly or indirectly through low-density lipoprotein [LDL] lowering). A large number of randomized control trials have shown that statins help in\u00a0the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, not only via their lipid-lowering effect, but also due\u00a0to their anti-inflammatory potential as well. In this paper, we examine the molecular pathways in which statins are implicated and exert their anti-inflammatory effects, and we focus specifically on their impact on innate and adaptive immunity systems. Finally, we review the most important clinical data for the role of statins in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.", 
    "148": "Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors that are widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Besides their cholesterol-lowering effect, statins have been reported to have antiviral activity against a variety of viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV). Several statins inhibit the in vitro replication of subgenomic HCV replicons and also suppress in vitro RNA replication of infectious HCV. The precise mechanism of the anti-HCV activity of statins has not yet been defined. Recent studies suggest that the antiviral effect may result from the inhibition of geranylgeranylation of cellular proteins, rather than the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Despite the antiviral effect observed in vitro, statin monotherapy seems to be insufficient for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. However, several prospective and retrospective studies have demonstrated that the addition of statins to IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy increases SVR, RVR, and EVR rates without the occurrence of additional adverse events. These clinical data, together with the excellent safety profile and low cost, suggest that statins may play a role in HCV therapy until more potent and safe direct-acting antivirals become available.

    "149": "In the present study, \u03b9- and \u03bb-carrageenans were used as appropriate carriers for sustained release formulations of fluvastatin drug. From viscosity measurements, it was found that both carrageenans can give miscible blends with fluvastatin due to the interactions between the sulfate groups of carrageenans and hydroxyl groups of fluvastatin. This was predicted by computational analysis using density functional theory and proved by FTIR spectroscopy. These interactions, which are in higher intensity using \u03b9-carrageenan, lead to the formation of complexes between polymeric matrices and fluvastatin drug. DSC experiments also confirmed that miscible blends between carrageenans and fluvastatin can be formed since in all concentrations only one glass transition temperature was recorded. Fluvastatin release depends on the drug content and in all formulations of \u03bb-carrageenans containing 10, 25 and 50 wt% drug, almost sustained release profiles were observed. Fluvastatin/carrageenan complexes have lower dissolution profiles compared with physical mixtures. Polymer swelling seems to be the dominant drug release mechanism.

The MRM method in statins determination has a novelty value, since there are no previous studies on their simultaneous analysis in environmental or plant samples. The method development and optimization was challenging due to the physicochemical similarities of the silylated lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin. The results showed that the use of MRM decreased their detection and quantification limits by factors of 2-10 compared to that obtained in TIC monitoring. The concentration calibration was made between 247.5ng/L and 9900ng/L. Limits of detection and quantification were between 50ng/L (lovastatin)-500ng/L (pravastatin) and 250ng/L (lovastatin)-1000ng/L (pravastatin), respectively. Based on the MRM results, the wood bark and phloem samples contained lovastatin, lovastatin-lactone, simvastatin, simvastatin-lactone, and pravastatin. Their concentrations were 250-3000\u03bcg/L, i.e. 4.2-50mg/kg in phloem and bark. However, they were not detected in fluids made with Pleurotus ostreatus fermentation of wood core.",

The bone cavities in the second group (control group) were filled with a blood clot and covered with a biological membrane. On the 7th, 21st and 42nd days, six animals in each group were euthanized, and the femurs were subject to histological evaluation (vascularity, fibrosis, reactive bone formation, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts) and immunohistochemical (anti-VEGF and anti-osteocalcin) analysis.

The primary end points were cardiac death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction (MI), revascularization, ischemic stroke and documented unstable angina or severe heart failure requiring emergency hospitalization. Baseline lipid levels were nearly identical in both groups with a mean LDL cholesterol level of 2.7 mmol/L (103 mg/dL). At 3 months, LDL cholesterol levels declined 20.2% in the moderate dose statin group and 26.6% in the intensive statin group, respectively (P<0.001). In a 2-year follow-up, a primary end point event occurred in 20 patients in the moderate dose statin group and in 28 patients in the intensive statin group.

However, large statin RCTs were usually restricted to the typical 5-6 years. Moreover, non-cardiovascular events, especially the risk of cancer, probably failed to emerge within a restricted period of 6 years. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of statin treatment by performing a meta-analysis of statin RCTs with extended follow-up beyond 6 years. Six RCTs with post-trial follow-up were eligible for inclusion, involving 47,296 patients with total follow-up ranging from 6.7 to 14.7 years. During the post-trial period, all the surviving participants were advised to take a statin and the cholesterol level were almost identical between the original statin group and the original placebo group. Over the entire 6.7-14.7 years of follow-up, a significant reduction in the rates of all-cause mortality (relative risk 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.85-0.96; P=0.0009), cardiovascular mortality (0.87, 0.81-0.93; P<0.0001) and major coronary events (0.79, 0.72-0.86; P<0.00001) was observed in favour of the original statin group. During 2-year post-trial period, further reduction in all-cause mortality (0.83, 0.74-0.93; P=0.001), cardiovascular mortality (0.81, 0.69-0.95; P=0.01) and major coronary events (0.77, 0.63-0.95; P=0.01) was observed among initially statin-treated patients. Over the entire follow-up period, statin treatment did not increase the incidence of cancers (0.99, 0.95-1.04; P=0.79), deaths from cancers (1.00, 0.93-1.07; P=0.98) and non-cardiovascular mortality (0.95, 0.90-1.00; P=0.07). In conclusion, statin treatment beyond 6 years is effective and safe in patients at high risk of vascular events. Moreover, earlier treatment with statin may not only preserve the initial benefit but also have further survival benefit for additional 2 years. Further studies are called for to explore the underlying mechanisms.", 
    "192": "Elderly patients commonly receive statin drugs for the primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Elderly patients also commonly receive antidepressant drugs, usually selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), for the treatment of depression, anxiety, or other conditions. SSRIs are associated with many pharmacokinetic drug interactions related to the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic pathways. There is concern that drugs that inhibit statin metabolism can trigger statin adverse effects, especially myopathy (which can be potentially serious, if rhabdomyolysis occurs). However, a detailed literature review of statin metabolism and of SSRI effects on CYP enzymes suggests that escitalopram, citalopram, and paroxetine are almost certain to be safe with all statins, and rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, and pravastatin are almost certain to be safe with all SSRIs. Even though other SSRI-statin combinations may theoretically be associated with risks, the magnitude of the pharmacokinetic interaction is likely to be below the threshold for clinical significance. Risk, if at all, lies in combining fluvoxamine with atorvastatin, simvastatin, or lovastatin, and even this risk can be minimized by using lower statin doses and monitoring the patient.",

Rosuvastatin users had higher risk of >four times ULN CPK (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.22, 2.15) as did patients with larger daily doses of other statin types. A recent clinical record of myalgia was associated with an increased OR of >four times ULN CPK (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37, 2.18). In patients who were rechallenged to statins and had repeat CPK measurements after >four times ULN CPK abnormalities, 54.8% of the repeat CPK values were within normal range, 32.1% between one to three times and 13.0% >four times ULN.",

It is entirely justified to warn against haphazard aggressive CH lowering, especially now, when more effective CH-modifying medications are entering the market. Enormous success in lowering the human toll of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) by treating abnormally elevated lipids may be off set by the therapeutic risk. There are warning reports that low cholesterol is associated with malignity. There is a pressing need to evaluate all reports related to the risk of low CH body stores. New cholesterol management guidelines presented by American professional cardiology societies in November 2013 have reinforced the need to critically evaluate the management with statins and with other CH lowering medications (Tab. 1, Fig. 3, Ref. 58).",

The efficacy of pantethine treatment on cardiovascular risk markers was investigated in a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled study, in a low to moderate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk North American population eligible for statin therapy, using the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines. A total of 32 subjects were randomized to pantethine (600 mg/day from weeks 1 to 8 and 900 mg/day from weeks 9 to 16) or placebo. Compared with placebo, the participants on pantethine showed a significant decrease in total cholesterol at 16 weeks (P=0.040) and LDL-C at 8 and 16 weeks (P=0.020 and P=0.006, respectively), and decreasing trends in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol at week 8 and week 12 (P=0.102 and P=0.145, respectively) that reached significance by week 16 (P=0.042). An 11% decrease in LDL-C from baseline was seen in participants on pantethine, at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16, while participants on placebo showed a 3% increase at week 16. This decrease was significant between groups at weeks 8 (P=0.027) and 16 (P=0.010). The homocysteine levels for both groups did not change significantly from baseline to week 16. Coenzyme Q10 significantly increased from baseline to week 4 and remained elevated until week 16, in both the pantethine and placebo groups. After 16 weeks, the participants on placebo did not show significant improvement in any CVD risk end points. This study confirms that pantethine lowers cardiovascular risk markers in low to moderate CVD risk participants eligible for statins according to NCEP guidelines.",

Pravastatin was given orally to the KD group at a dose of 5 mg/day for children under 5 and 10 mg/day for children older than 5 years. To determine the effects of pravastatin on endothelial function, high-frequency ultrasound was performed before the start of the study and 6 months after pravastatin therapy. The parameters measured were brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), non-flow mediated dilation (NMD), and carotid artery stiffness index (SI). High sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, the circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) number, and serum lipid profiles were also determined at baseline and after 6 months of pravastatin treatment.",

Also, statins are supposed to alter number and function of circulating PCs. We aimed to investigate PC mobilization after acute ischemic stroke as well as its association with inflammatory markers and statin therapy. Sixty-five patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in the study. The number of CD133+ PCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. Blood samples were drawn within 24 hours after symptom onset and after 5 days. The number of CD133+ PCs increased significantly within 5 days (p<0.001). We found no correlation between CD133+ PCs and the serum levels of IL-8, IL-6, or C-reactive protein (CRP). Multivariate analysis revealed that preexisting statin therapy correlated independently with the increase of CD133+ PCs (p=0.001). This study showed a mobilization of CD133+ PCs in patients with acute cerebral infarction within 5 days after symptom onset. The early systemic inflammatory response did not seem to be a decisive factor in the mobilization of PCs. Preexisting statin therapy was associated with the increase in CD133+ PCs, suggesting a potentially beneficial effect of statin therapy in patients with stroke.",

Identification of the mutation and related molecular mechanisms has rapidly led to independent clinical trials testing different marketed drugs with a preclinically documented impact on those mechanisms. However, the extensive functional effects of those drugs remain essentially unexplored. We have undertaken a systematic comparative study of the three main treatments currently administered or proposed to progeria-affected children, namely, a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, the combination of an aminobisphosphonate and a statin (zoledronate and pravastatin), and the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin. This work was based on the assumption that mesodermal stem cells, which are derived from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome-induced pluripotent stem cells expressing major defects associated with the disease, may be instrumental to revealing such effects. Whereas all three treatments significantly improved misshapen cell nuclei typically associated with progeria, differences were observed in terms of functional improvement in prelamin A farnesylation, progerin expression, defective cell proliferation, premature osteogenic differentiation, and ATP production. Finally, we have evaluated the effect of the different drug combinations on this cellular model. This study revealed no additional benefit compared with single-drug treatments, whereas a cytostatic effect equivalent to that of a farnesyltransferase inhibitor alone was systematically observed. Altogether, these results reveal the complexity of the modes of action of different drugs, even when they have been selected on the basis of a similar mechanistic hypothesis, and underscore the use of induced pluripotent stem cell derivatives as a critical and powerful tool for standardized, comparative pharmacological studies.",

SV/SVA plasma concentrations, demographic/clinical data, and genotypes for 18 genetic variants were collected from 74 individuals (three clinical trials) and analyzed using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. The structural model that best described the data included a two- and a one-compartment disposition model for SV and SVA, respectively. Age, weight, Japanese ethnicity, and seven genetic polymorphisms-rs4149056 (SLCO1B1), rs776746 (CYP3A5), rs12422149 (SLCO2B1), rs2231142 (ABCG2), rs4148162 (ABCG2), rs4253728 (PPARA), and rs35599367 (CYP3A4)-were identified as significantly affecting model parameters.

Both measures of central fat distribution appeared to be better predictors of recurrent cardiovascular events when compared with body mass index, whereas sagittal abdominal distention was the better predictor compared with waist circumference, even after multivariate adjustment. After adjusting for secondary prevention interventions-statin, aspirin, \u03b2-blocker use, and physical activity-the risk of recurrent event was observed to decrease by about 1%.",
