    "0": "LDL receptor (LDLr) is widely expressed in both liver and peripheral tissue. We aimed to clarify tissue-specific regulation of LDLr in hepatic cell line (HepG2) cells and human kidney mesangial cells (HMCs) under physiological and inflammatory conditions. We have demonstrated that the concentration of LDL required for 50% inhibition of LDLr mRNA expression (IC50) in HepG2 was 75 microg/ml, but only 30 microg/ml in HMCs. The concentration of mevastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, which achieved 200% upregulation of LDLr (UC200) in HepG2 cells, was 0.7 microM, which is much lower than 2.8 microM in HMCs. Inflammatory stress increased IC50 to 80 and 75 microg/ml of LDL, UC(200) to 2.8 microM, and 4.2 microM of mevastatin in HepG2 and HMCs. There was obvious sterol-regulatory element binding protein cleavage-activating protein accumulation in the Golgi in HepG2 cells, but not in HMCs in the presence of high concentration of LDL. IL-1beta further increased sterol-regulatory element binding protein cleavage-activating protein accumulation in HepG2 and HMCs in the presence of high concentration of LDL. These results indicate that LDLr in HepG2 cells have a relative resistant phenotype for downregulation, while LDLr in HMCs is very sensitive for downregulation. Inflammatory cytokine disrupts LDLr negative feedback regulation induced by intracellular cholesterol in both cell types, to a greater degree in HMCs, which could be one reason why HMCs are more prone to become foam cells under inflammatory stress. Inflammation also causes statin resistance; therefore, a high concentration of statin may be required to achieve the same biological effect.", 
    "1": "Three-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, known as statins, induce skeletal muscle injury including myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism of this myotoxicity remains unknown. This study examined the effect of statins on single skeletal myofibers enzymatically isolated from the rat flexor digitorum brevis muscles. Fluvastatin and pravastatin induced the formation of numerous vacuoles in the myofibers after 72 h of treatment. This effect progressed in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and, consequently, cell death occurred after 120 h. Electron micrographs revealed craters along the sarcolemma and swelling of the sarcoplasmic reticula and mitochondria, in addition to intracellular vacuoles. When caffeine was added after 72 h of fluvastatin treatment, contractile shortening of statin-treated myofibers was significantly attenuated and blebs formed on the surface of the myofibers. The coapplication of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) with fluvastatin prevented the morphological changes, while that of farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) was ineffective. Furthermore, perillyl alcohol, an inhibitor of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase-I (GGTase-I), mimicked the effect of statins, while a specific GGTase-I inhibitor (GGTI-298) or a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI-277) failed to do so. These results suggest that the inactivation of Rab GTPase, which involved in intracellular membrane transport, is a crucial factor in statin-induced-morphological abnormality in skeletal muscle fibers.", 
    "2": "In an attempt to improve global cardiovascular risk prediction, considerable interest has focused on C-reactive protein (CRP), that has been shown in multiple prospective epidemiological studies to predict incident myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and sudden cardiac death. CRP is a hepatically-derived pentraxin that plays a key role in the innate immune response. Standard CRP tests determine levels which are increased up to 1000-fold in response to infection or tissue destruction, but cannot adequately assess the normal range. High-sensitive CRP detects levels of CRP within the normal range as well as higher levels proven to predict future cardiovascular events. The relationship between a patient's baseline plasma level of CRP and future vascular risk has been consistent in several studies, and in most cases has proven independent of major \"traditional\" risk factors such as age, smoking, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and diabetes. Several pharmacological agents proven to reduce vascular risk influence CRP levels. Other lipid-lowering agents reported to reduce CRP include niacin, fibrates, and gemfibrozil. Aspirin also has an intriguing interaction with CRP in that the magnitude of relative risk reduction attributable to aspirin in primary prevention appears to be greatest among those with elevated CRP and declines proportionately in direct relation to CRP levels. Observational data, moreover, suggest possible differential benefits for clopidogrel and abciximab on the basis of CRP levels before percutaneous coronary interventions. As documented above for primary prevention, CRP is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events that adds prognostic information to lipid screening, to the metabolic syndrome, and to the Framingham risk score. An approach in primary prevention is to measure CRP only among those at intermediate risk as defined by the Framingham risk score. In secondary prevention, the potential utility of CRP is less certain, as aggressive therapies should already be instituted and low-density lipoprotein evaluation provides an excellent method to assess statin efficacy.", 
    "3": "Atrial fibrillation is a common and in most patients recurrent arrhythmia. Atrial fibrillation can increase mortality and causes at times severe symptoms in affected patients. Timely initiation of sustained oral anticoagulation is indicated in patients with atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke to prevent thromboembolic complications. Patients at risk for stroke can be identified by clinical characteristics using validated score systems, e.g., the CHADS(2) score or the Framingham score. Drugs that slow AV nodal conduction can improve symptoms associated with high ventricular rate. Cardioversion can acutely terminate atrial fibrillation in almost all patients, but many patients suffer from recurrent atrial fibrillation. The prevention of arrhythmia recurrences (\"rhythm control therapy\") is indicated in patients with severe arrhythmia-related symptoms. Antiarrhythmic drugs can approximately double the maintenance rate of sinus rhythm. Other drugs that were not primarily developed as antiarrhythmic agents, e.g., ACE inhibitors, sartans, and possibly statins, can further improve maintenance of sinus rhythm in selected patient groups. Catheter-based isolation of the pulmonary veins is a recently developed intervention that can cure some forms of atrial fibrillation. It is likely that a multimodal therapeutic approach will in the future allow rhythm control therapy to become more effective.", 
    "4": "We compared the lipid-lowering, vasodilating, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties of NCX 6560, a novel NO-releasing derivative of atorvastatin, with those of atorvastatin. NCX 6560 and atorvastatin induced similar inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in rat smooth muscle cells (IC(50)=1.9+/-0.4 and 3.9+/-1.0 microM, respectively). However, in hyperlipidemic mice, a 5-week oral treatment with NCX 6560 (46.8 mg/kg/day, p.o.) was more effective than equivalent atorvastatin (40 mg/kg/day, p.o.) at lowering serum cholesterol (NCX 6560: -21% vs controls, P<0.05; atorvastatin: -14% vs control, P=NS). In norepinephrine-precontracted rabbit aortic rings, NCX 6560-induced vasodilation (EC(50)=53.5+/-8.3 microM) and in PC12 cells it stimulated cGMP formation (EC(50)=1.8+/-0.7 microM), while atorvastatin was inactive. In lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli (LPS)-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages, NCX 6560 reduced iNOS expression and dimer assembly more efficiently than atorvastatin and inhibited nitrite accumulation (IC(50)=6.7+/-1.6 microM) and TNFalpha release. U46619- or collagen plus epinephrine-induced platelet pulmonary thromboembolism in mice was reduced by NCX 6560 at 46.8 mg/kg p.o. (mortality: -44% and -56% vs vehicle, respectively; P<0.05), but not by atorvastatin 40 mg/kg, p.o. In the U46619-induced mortality model, isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) (20 mg/kg, p.o.), a pure NO-donor, was also active (mortality: -40%, P<0.05). NCX 6560 significantly reduced ex vivo platelet adhesion to collagen at high shear (-31+/-1.3% vs vehicle), and so did ISMN (-33.3+/-1.7% vs vehicle). Atorvastatin was ineffective. NCX 6560, but not atorvastatin, reduced blood pressure in eNOS knockout mice (-16%, P<0.001 vs vehicle), an effect not observed in wild type mice. On the contrary, ISMN provoked a significant drop of blood pressure both in wild type (-20%, P<0.05 vs vehicle) and in eNOS-/- mice (-21%, P<0.05 vs vehicle). In conclusion, NCX 6560 exerts greater lipid-lowering, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects than atorvastatin, due to a large extent to NO release.", 
    "5": "Hypercholesterolemia contributes to coronary heart disease but little is known about its direct effect on myocardial function. We evaluated left ventricular function using echocardiography and the effect of treatment with rosuvastatin in a group of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "6": "Thirty-three patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (HC) and without evidence of coronary heart disease and 25 aged matched healthy volunteers (C) were submitted to conventional echocardiography, pulsed wave tissue Doppler imaging (PWTDI), color Doppler myocardial imaging (CDMI) and integrated backscatter (IBS). Echocardiographic evaluation was repeated after 6 months of treatment with rosuvastatin (10mg/day) in 17 patients. Compared with C, patients with HC showed lower E/A ratio (p<0.0001) and higher Tei index mit (p<0.0001), as well as lower PW TDI E/A both at septum (p<0.0001) and at lateral level (p<0.0001) and higher modified Tei index both at septal annulus (p<0.0001) and lateral annulus (p<0.0001). Integrated backscatter parameters were significantly reduced in patients with HC (CVIsept p<0.0001 and CVI post wall p<0.05). CDMI derived indices in the two groups were not different. After 6 months of Rosuvastatin treatment a significant reduction of LDL cholesterol levels (51%, p<0.0001) was registered in HC patients together with a significant improvement of longitudinal global systolic and diastolic function (Tei index) and myocardial intrinsic contractility (CVI).", 
    "7": "These data suggest that in patients with hypercholesterolemia exists an early cardiomyopathy characterized by systolic and diastolic dysfunction. That could produce a substratum for an \"impaired preconditioning\". Rosuvastatin seems able to revert systolic abnormalities.", 
    "8": "The discontinuation of statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes has been associated with an increase of adverse coronary events. Patients who undergo major surgery frequently are not able to take oral medication shortly after surgery. Because there is no intravenous formula for statins, the interruption of statins in the postoperative period is a serious concern. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of perioperative statin withdrawal on postoperative cardiac outcome. Also, the association between outcome and type of statin was studied. In 298 consecutive statin users who underwent major vascular surgery, detailed cardiac histories were obtained, and medication use was noted. Postoperatively, troponin levels were measured on days 1, 3, 7, and 30 and whenever clinically indicated by electrocardiographic changes. End points were postoperative troponin release, myocardial infarction, and a combination of nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. Multivariate analyses and propensity score analyses were performed to assess the influence of type of statin and the discontinuation of statins for these end points. Statin discontinuation was associated with an increased risk for postoperative troponin release (hazard ratio 4.6, 95% confidence interval 2.2 to 9.6) and the combination of myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 7.5, 95% confidence interval 2.8 to 20.1). Extended-release fluvastatin was associated with fewer perioperative cardiac events compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. In conclusion, the present study showed that statin withdrawal in the perioperative period is associated with an increased risk for perioperative adverse cardiac events. Furthermore, there seemed to be better outcomes in patients who received statins with extended-release formulas.", 
    "9": "Many epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the linear relation between elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the risk for coronary heart disease. Conversely, for each 1% reduction in LDL cholesterol in clinical trials, there is a corresponding 1% reduction in coronary heart disease risk. Although the degree of reduction is more important in affecting risk than the means used to lower LDL, statins are considered the most consistently effective means of lowering LDL. The National Cholesterol Education Program now recommends an optional goal of <70 mg/dl for patients at very high risk for coronary heart disease. In conclusion, on the basis of completed clinical trials, there is no evidence that achieving and maintaining such low levels of LDL cholesterol result in adverse effects. The most potent statins, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, are capable of getting most patients to their LDL cholesterol goals, but combinations of statins with other drugs may be necessary for patients who require additional lipid lowering.", 
    "10": "Angiotensin receptor blockers have been hypothesized to have synergistic effects with statins. We evaluated the effects of valsartan alone or combined with simvastatin on blood pressure (BP) and indexes of inflammation and oxidant stress in hypertensive patients with hyperlipidemia. In this double-blind trial, 404 patients were randomized to 12 weeks valsartan 160 mg (V) or valsartan 160 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg (V/S20) or 80 mg (V/S80). Twenty-four-hour mean ambulatory BP and biochemical marker measurements were recorded at baseline and study end. There were no statistically significant between-treatment differences for least-square mean reductions from baseline in systolic BP (V, -9.22; V/S20, -9.25; V/S80, -9.58 mm Hg; p <0.0001 for all within-treatment changes vs baseline). Plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased with the combinations but not with V alone (least-square mean median change from baseline, -0.16, -0.20, -0.70 mg/L; p = 0.0001 for V/S80 vs baseline; p = 0.045 for V/S20 vs baseline; p = 0.0023 for V/S80 vs V/S20; p = 0.0045 for V/S80 vs V). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was reduced by V, with no evidence for additional lowering with V/S combinations. In conclusion, addition of simvastatin to valsartan did not incrementally lower BP. However, V/S80 was superior to V and V/S20 in reducing high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.", 
    "11": "The multicenter EUROPA trial of 12,218 patients showed that perindopril decreased adverse clinical events in patients with established coronary heart disease. The PERSPECTIVE study, a substudy of the EUROPA trial, evaluated the effect of perindopril on coronary plaque progression as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). In total 244 patients (mean age 57 years, 81% men) were included. Evaluable paired quantitative coronary angiograms were obtained from 96 patients randomized to perindopril and from 98 patients to placebo. Concomitant treatment at baseline consisted of aspirin (90%), lipid-lowering agents (70%), and beta blockers (60%). The primary and secondary end point was the difference of minimum and mean lumen diameters (quantitative coronary angiography) or mean plaque cross-sectional area (IVUS) measured at baseline and 3-year follow-up between the perindopril and placebo groups. After a median follow-up of 3.0 years (range 1.9 to 4.1), no differences in change in quantitative coronary angiographic or IVUS measurements were detected between the perindopril and placebo groups (minimum and mean luminal diameters -0.07 +/- 0.4 vs -0.02 +/- 0.4 mm, p = 0.34; mean luminal diameter -0.05 +/- 0.2 vs -0.05 +/- 0.3 mm, p = 0.89; mean plaque cross-sectional area -0.18 +/- 1.2 vs -0.02 +/- 1.2 mm(2), p = 0.48). In conclusion, we found no progression in coronary artery disease by quantitative coronary angiography and IVUS with long-term administration of perindopril or placebo, possibly because most patients were on concomitant treatment with a statin.", 
    "12": "The levels and protein/lipid compositions of major lipoprotein particles of 19 pediatric cardiac transplant recipients (4-18 yr of age) were studied in this prospective, open clinical follow-up study before and at one yr of pravastatin therapy (10 mg/day). The recipients were grouped into those with (n = 6; group A) and those without (n = 13; group B) angiographically detectable vasculopathy. Twenty-one pediatric non-transplant controls were studied at baseline. At baseline, the group A recipients had 29% lower HDL-C concentrations (p = 0.031) and 29% higher apoB-100/apoA-I ratios (p = 0.034) than the group B recipients. At one yr of pravastatin, the respective figures were 29% (p = 0.013) and 33% (p = 0.005). Compared with the healthy pediatric controls, the transplant recipients had significantly higher serum TG before pravastatin [median (range): 1.3 mmol/L (0.6-3.2) vs. 0.7 mmol/L (0.3-2.4), p = 0.0002] and at one yr [1.3 mmol/L (0.5-3.5) vs. 0.7 mmol/L (0.3-2.4), p = 0.0004]. The baseline apoB-100/apoA1 ratios of the recipients were 33% higher (p = 0.005). In conclusion, low HDL-C and high apoB-100/apoA-I ratio were associated with angiographically detectable vasculopathy. Even though pravastatin effectively lowered the TC and LDL-C and improved compositional properties of LDL and HDL(2) particles, it failed to normalize the elevated TG and, in some patients, to prevent the progression of transplant vasculopathy.", 
    "13": "Statins are competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins are widely and successfully used for lowering plasma cholesterol levels causing up to 45% reduction of plasma cholesterol and considerable reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. The main atheroprotective action of statins is reduction of plasma low density lipoprotein levels due to improved clearance of this lipoprotein by the liver. In addition, statins cause mild elevation of high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration, but the mechanism responsible for this effect of statins on HDL metabolism is not well understood. It has been hypothesized that statins affect the HDL level through inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity or by stimulating apolipoprotein A-I synthesis. Increased cholesterol efflux from liver due to raised expression of the ABCA1 transporter may also elevate HDL levels. Whereas raising the plasma HDL-C concentration may contribute to the atheroprotective effect of statins, its magnitude is uncertain and additional mechanisms that improve the functionality of HDL may be equally or more important. In this review we analyze what is currently known about effect of statins on HDL metabolism and on reverse cholesterol transport in particular.", 
    "14": "The last 15 years have witnessed a resurgence of the role of surgical options for prevention of ischemic stroke. The landmark randomized trials including NASCET and ECST were published and explored the role of carotid endarterectomy in this regard. Patients with high grade stenosis of the internal carotid artery (> or = 70%) with prior TIA or minor non disabling stroke in the same territory were shown to have significant benefit of the procedure compared to best medical treatment. Benefit was comparatively less in patients with moderate grade stenosis of the ICA (50-69%). Surgical treatment of patients with <50% stenosis of the ICA resulted in worse outcomes compared to medical therapy and is consequently not recommended. These studies also standardized the method for measuring the degree of ICA stenosis. The ACAS and ACST studies attempted to resolve the rather vexing issue of surgical treatment of patients with asymptomatic ICA stenosis. The risk benefit ratio in asymptomatic patients is low and depends to a large extent on a low perioperative complication rate. Studies have also attempted to identify the best medical treatment in the perioperative period during CEA. Low dose aspirin has been shown to be beneficial, but the role of statins and betablockers is promising but yet uncertain. Ischemic stroke is a common complication after CABG. In this regard surgeons have differed in their approaches to performing CEA, some preferring to do it during the bypass surgery, while others prefer a two staged procedure. The surgical treatment of complete carotid occlusion by EC-IC bypass surgery has also enjoyed renewed interest and results of the COSS study are awaited keenly. The EC-IC bypass surgical procedure is also beneficial in moya-moya disease.", 
    "15": "Stroke prevails as a common and devastating disease. Epidemiological studies have advanced our understanding of stroke risk factors and clinical trials have demonstrated effective interventions to decrease stroke risk by modifying risk factors. Stroke risk factors are classified as traditional and novel and may be further divided into modifiable and non-modifiable. In this review we discuss select traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke, interventions for primary and secondary prevention and areas of research progress. Stroke treatment should be comprehensive, involving patient, community and medical personnel education, evaluation of individual risk factors and overall stroke risk assessment. Ongoing research is exploring further interventions in the management of traditional risk factors. Future research will expand our knowledge about the contribution of genetic factors to stroke, their interaction with environmental factors and open exciting avenues for the development of new therapies.", 
    "16": "Patients with mixed dyslipidaemia have raised triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Augmentation of HDL cholesterol by inhibition of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) could benefit these patients. We aimed to investigate the effect of the CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, on carotid atherosclerosis progression in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia.", 
    "17": "We did a randomised double-blind trial at 64 centres in North America and Europe. 752 eligible participants completed an atorvastatin-only run-in period for dose titration, after which they all continued to receive atorvastatin at the titrated dose. 377 of these patients were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg of torcetrapib per day and 375 to placebo. We made carotid ultrasound images at baseline and at 6-month intervals for 24 months. The primary endpoint was the yearly rate of change in the maximum intima-media thickness of 12 carotid segments. Analysis was restricted to 683 patients who had at least one dose of treatment and had at least one follow-up carotid intima-media measurement; they were analysed as randomised. Mean follow-up for these patients was 22 (SD 4.8) months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00134238.",

Patients in the combined-treatment group had a 63.4% relative increase in HDL cholesterol (p<0.0001) and an 17.7% relative decrease in LDL cholesterol (p<0.0001), compared with controls. Systolic blood pressure increased by 6.6 mm Hg in the combined-treatment group and 1.5 mm Hg in the atorvastatin-only group (difference 5.4 mm Hg, 95% CI 4.3-6.4, p<0.0001).", 
    "19": "Although torcetrapib substantially raised HDL cholesterol and lowered LDL cholesterol, it also increased systolic blood pressure, and did not affect the yearly rate of change in the maximum intima-media thickness of 12 carotid segments. Torcetrapib showed no clinical benefit in this or other studies, and will not be developed further.", 
    "20": "We report a fatal case of toxic myopathy in a patient with a transplanted heart for severe ischemic coronary artery disease. He was on long-term cyclosporine, prednisone, and mycofenolate. Four months before the development of proximal muscle weakness, his simvastatin dose was doubled, and he was also started on colchicine for acute exacerbation of gout. He developed progressive muscle weakness leading to shortness of breath and hospitalization for respiratory failure. Colchicine and simvastatin were stopped on admission. He received high-dose methylprednisolone for continued muscle weakness while he was sedated with propofol. These changes led to a marked elevation of creatine kinase, peaking at 33,580 U/ml. The muscle biopsy revealed toxic vacuolization, mitochondrial damage, and no evidence of inflammation. Based on the timing of events, the combination of propofol, high-dose methylprednisolone, and cyclosporine have triggered rhabdomyolysis, which may have been facilitated by prior administration of colchicine and simvastatin.", 
    "21": "Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is the leading cause of late kidney allograft loss. Recent studies have suggested that atorvastatin (ATO) may interact with the acute inflammatory process in the renal interstitium and suppress the proliferation of mesangial cells. We hypothesized that ATO could also inhibit the chronic inflammatory process and prevent the progression of CAN.", 
    "22": "Fisher (F344) kidneys were orthotopically transplanted into Lewis rat recipients. Lewis-to-Lewis rat kidney transplantation was served as the syngeneic control (Syn group). Allograft recipients were randomized and treated with cyclosporine A alone (Allo group) or in combination with ATO (15 or 30 mg/kg/d intrgastric, respectively, the low dose treatment group/high dose treatment group [LT/HT] groups). Renal function and the urine protein excretion were analyzed. Animals were sacrificed 20 weeks posttransplantation for histological and immunohistochemical studies, as well as analysis of mRNA levels of cytokines and chemokines.", 
    "23": "Renal function progressively deteriorated and substantial proteinuria developed in the Allo group compared with the Syn group. ATO-treated rats had significantly higher creatinine clearance rate and less amount of proteinuria. Histological examination revealed obvious features of CAN in the Allo group, whereas LT/HT groups demonstrated minimal glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, intimal thickening, and tubular atrophy. The numbers of infiltrating mononuclear cells (ED1+, CD8+, and CD68+) decreased markedly, and the intragraft expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and collagen III were also significantly attenuated in the LT/HT groups, as compared with the Allo group. The mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, interleukin-10), chemokines (RANTES, MCP-1), and profibrotic genes (TGF-beta1, collagen III) were significantly down-regulated in ATO-treated rats.", 
    "24": "Atorvastatin showed excellent favorable effects on blocking renal inflammation and fibrosis, and thus, efficiently inhibited the development and progression of CAN, which might improve the long-term survival rate of renal allografts.", 
    "25": "Endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness are considered independent predictors of cardiovascular risk. Endothelial dysfunction primarily reflects decreased availability of nitric oxide, a critical endothelium-derived vasoactive factor with vasodilatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties. Techniques for assessing endothelial dysfunction include ultrasonographic measurement of flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery and plethysmographic measurement of forearm blood flow responses to vasoactive agents. Arterial stiffness can be assessed using pulse wave analysis to generate measures of pulse wave velocity, arterial compliance and wave reflection. It has been demonstrated that the preventive effect of statins on coronary events is not only attributed to cholesterol-lowering, but also to various effects on the vascular wall, which include improved endothelial function as well as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Previous studies have reported improvement of arterial stiffness by the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of statin therapy in patients with or without hypercholesterolemia. The present review considers the pathophysiology underlying endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness associated with atherosclerotic disease and the beneficial effects of statins on these markers of atherosclerosis.", 
    "26": "It has been claimed that early use of statins in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) protects patients against recurrent ischemic events. This protective effect takes place as early as 4 months after treatment initiation in non-ST elevation ACS, as reported in the MIRACL trial. Mechanisms such as improvement in endothelial function and inflammation are possible explanations for this early effect. These findings have been used to propose statins as part of the acute phase therapy. However, the use of statins during hospitalization is an unresolved issue, because there is a lack of evidence regarding the benefit of initiating therapy in the acute phase. Most randomized trials included patients after several days of the index event and did not report in-hospital outcome. This review critically discusses the use of statins in ACS and the level of evidence regarding their beneficial effect in acute phase treatment.", 
    "27": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most important cause of death in the industrialized world. After experimental myocardial infarction, numerous dilated vessels appear in the border zone between the infarct and noninfarct areas. Angiogenic therapy has been widely regarded as an attractive approach for both treating CAD and enhancing arterioprotective functions of the endothelium. In this report, we critically review the evidence supporting the regulation of angiogenesis and angiogenic factors by cardiovascular medications such as statins, cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and calcium channel blocker, etc. Furthermore, in patients with CAD, vascular growth (vasculogenesis), capillary network growth (angiogenesis) and collateral artery growth (arteriogenesis), may be important. Current evidence from clinical trials on these therapies suggests that the development of coronary collateral circulation is likely to be a viable therapeutic strategy for CAD, while adaptation to chronic coronary stenosis can proceed. Many studies have suggested that newly developed strategies which include the administration of angiogenic growth factors and the transplantation of bone marrow-derived angioblasts are beneficial for the ischemic heart. Our assessment of the evidence in this review leads us to conclude that the development of collateral circulation using conventional cardiovascular medications may also play a critical role and needs to be reconsidered in the treatment of patients with CAD.", 
    "28": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition with a significant effect on quality of life. The prevalence of ED increases with age and other risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia and depression). Nitric oxide (NO) activity is adversely affected, in penile and vascular tissue, by these risk factors. Endothelial dysfunction and a reduced generation or bioavailability of NO have emerged as major pathophysiological mechanisms in ED. Hyperlipidemia may impair erectile function by affecting endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the penis. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein is a causative factor for the impaired relaxation response of the corpus cavernosum. Elevated serum cholesterol and reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of ED. It follows that treating dyslipidemia could have a beneficial effect on ED. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are now considered as first line treatment for ED. There is evidence that statins improve responses to these drugs. ED is considered as a warning sign of silent or early vascular disease. The use of statins may be beneficial in these patients.", 
    "29": "ACTFAST-2 was designed to match the starting dose of a statin to the baseline low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) value, to allow high-risk European subjects to achieve LDL-C targets within 12 weeks with the initial dose or one up-titration.", 
    "30": "This was a 12-week, prospective, open-label trial that enrolled 610 high-risk subjects from 8 European countries. Subjects with LDL-C > 2.6 mmol/L (> 100 mg/dL), but < or = 5.7 mmol/L (< or = 220 mg/dL) were assigned a starting dose of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, 80 mg/day) according to LDL-C level and status of statin use at baseline (either statin-free or statin-treated), with a single up-titration at 6 weeks if needed.", 
    "31": "At 12 weeks, 68.0% of subjects overall, including 73.5% of statin-free and 60.5% of statin-treated subjects, achieved LDL-C target (< 2.6 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL). The total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) ratio target was achieved by 75.2% of subjects overall, including 78.1% of statin-free and 71.2% of statin-treated subjects. In the statin-free group, LDL-C decreased by a mean of 42%. In the statin-treated group, atorvastatin led to an additional 31% reduction in LDL-C over the statin used at baseline. Mean decreases in TC/HDL-C ratio were 30% and 20% in the statin-free and statin-treated groups, respectively. The incidence of AST/ALT greater than 3 times of upper limit of normal range in all patients was 0.8% and no rhabdomyolysis was reported.",

    "33": "Treatment for hyperciholesterolemia targets low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In July 2004, an update to the existingcholesterol guidelines was published that recommended more intense lowering of LDL levels. This study, a retrospective chart review conducted at a multispecialty medical group practice, aimed to determine iflow-dose simvastatin (5 or 10 mg) was effective at achieving LDL goal, in light of these more aggressive guidelines. Demographic data, including risk factors and LDL levels, were collected on 173 patients identified as taking low-dose simvastatin. The review indicated that 66% of patients with low-to-rnoderate cardiovascular risk treated with low-dose simvastatin achieved their risk-appropriate LDL goalMore than 50% of patients who achieved this LDL goal on low-dose simvastatin fell into lower-risk cattegories. Therefore, low-dose simvastatin may be a beneficial treatment option for patients in lower cardiovascular-risk categories.", 
    "34": "Simvastatin is an important cholesterol lowering compound and is currently synthesized from the natural product lovastatin via multistep chemical synthesis. We have previously reported the use of an Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pAW31 as the host for whole-cell biocatalytic conversion of monacolin J acid to simvastatin acid. During fermentation and bioconversion, unknown E. coli enzyme(s) hydrolyzed the membrane permeable thioester substrate dimethylbutyryl-S-methyl mercaptopropionate (DMB-S-MMP) to the free acid, significantly decreased the efficiencies of the whole-cell bioconversion and the downstream purification steps. Using the Keio K-12 Singe-Gene Knockout collection, we identified BioH as the sole enzyme responsible for the observed substrate hydrolysis. Purification and reconstitution of E. coli BioH activity in vitro confirmed its function. BioH catalyzed the rapid hydrolysis of DMB-S-MMP with kcat and Km values of 260+/-45 s(-1) and 229+/-26 microM, respectively. This is in agreement with previous reports that BioH can function as a carboxylesterase towards fatty acid esters. YT2, which is a delta bioH mutant of BL21(DE3), did not hydrolyze DMB-S-MMP during prolonged fermentation and was used as an alternative host for whole-cell biocatalysis. The rate of simvastatin acid synthesis in YT2 was significantly faster than in BL21(DE3) and 99% conversion of 15 mM simvastatin acid in less than 12 h was achieved. Furthermore, the engineered host required significantly less DMB-S-MMP to be added to accomplish complete conversion. Finally, simvastatin acid synthesized using YT2 can be readily purified from fermentation broth and no additional steps to remove the hydrolyzed dimethylbutyryl-S-mercaptopropionic acid is required. Together, the proteomic and metabolic engineering approaches render the whole-cell biocatalytic process more robust and economically attractive.", 
    "35": "Lowering plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), blood pressure, homocysteine, and preventing platelet aggregation using a combination of a statin, three blood pressure lowering drugs such as a thiazide, a beta blocker, and an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor each at half standard dose; folic acid; and aspirin - called as polypill - was estimated to reduce cardiovascular events by approximately 80%. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) and their long-chain metabolites and other products prevent platelet aggregation, lower blood pressure, reduce LDL-C, and ameliorate the adverse actions of homocysteine. Thus, EFAs and their metabolites show all the actions expected of the \"polypill\". Unlike the proposed \"polypill\", EFAs are endogenous molecules, have no significant side effects, can be taken orally for long periods of time even by pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children; and have been shown to reduce the incidence cardiovascular diseases. I propose that a rational combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids is as beneficial as that of the \"polypill\"; and may even show additional benefit in the prevention of depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and enhance cognitive function.",

A total of 55 consecutive patients with acute pericarditis were randomized in a double-blind manner into two groups: group 1 (statin group) was treated with 150 mg of indomethacin plus 10 mg of rosuvastatin, and group 2 (placebo group) was treated with 150 mg of indomethacin plus placebo. Both groups received treatment up to the normalization of inflammation markers and for the following week. Clinical and laboratory assessments [white cell count, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein), troponin I, creatine kinase and brain natriuretic peptide plasma levels], ECG and echocardiogram were performed at baseline and daily up to discharge. All of the patients were followed as outpatients for 3 months to evaluate any recurrence of pericarditis. The two groups were similar in age, sex and laboratory parameters [group 1 (the statin group), n=28 patients; gender, 18 male and ten female; and age, 29.5+/-5.7 years; group 2 (placebo group), n=27 patients; gender, 16 male/11 female; and age, 29.2+/-4.8 years].

    "49": "Statins are a class of drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGcoA) reductase, a critical enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Several reports document that statins may prevent different human cancers. However, whether or not statins can prevent cancer is controversial due to discordant results. One possible explanation for these conflicting conclusions is that only some tumors or specific statins may be effective. Here, we demonstrate in an in vivo transgenic model in which atorvastatin reverses and prevents the onset of MYC-induced lymphomagenesis, but fails to reverse or prevent tumorigenesis in the presence of constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D). Using phosphoprotein fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, atorvastatin treatment was found to result in the inactivation of the Ras and ERK1/2 signaling pathways associated with the dephosphorylation and inactivation of MYC. Correspondingly, tumors with a constitutively activated K-Ras (G12D) did not exhibit dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MYC. Atorvastatin's effects on MYC were specific to the inhibition of HMGcoA reductase, as treatment with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, abrogated these effects and inhibited the ability of atorvastatin to reverse or suppress tumorigenesis. Also, RNAi directed at HMGcoA reductase was sufficient to abrogate the neoplastic properties of MYC-induced tumors. Thus, atorvastatin, by inhibiting HMGcoA reductase, induces changes in phosphoprotein signaling that in turn prevent MYC-induced lymphomagenesis.",

This is a blinded component in a 5,518-patient subset of the ACCORD cohort. These participants were randomized to either be (1) treated with simvastatin (titrated to 40 mg/day if necessary to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level of <2.59 mmol/L [100 mg/dL]) plus placebo or (2) treated to the same goal LDL cholesterol level with the statin plus active fenofibrate 160 mg/day or its bioequivalent (or 54 mg/day if the estimated glomerular filtration rate ranges from 30 to <50 mL/min per 1.73 m2). Setting an upper limit of LDL cholesterol qualifying for randomization excluded patients who would not likely achieve the LDL cholesterol goal. Recruitment for ACCORD began in January 2001, and follow-up is scheduled to end in June 2009. Since recruitment began, several clinical trials and consensus statements have been published that led to changes in the details of the lipid treatment algorithm and protocol. This report describes the design of the lipid protocol and modifications to the protocol during the course of the study in response to and in anticipation of these developments.

The prevalence of diabetes is increasing in the United States and, thus, the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes poses an urgent public health challenge. The objective of this report is to review the current knowledge base for the prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes, with particular emphasis on the control of glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure. Epidemiologic analyses suggest that each 1% increase in glycosylated hemoglobin increases the risk for CVD by approximately 18%; however, evidence from the randomized trials that have examined whether glucose lowering reduces this risk is conflicting. Randomized trials have shown that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduces CVD event rates by 17%-43% in patients with diabetes. Limited data support a role for lowering triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the prevention of CVD. Evidence from clinical trials shows that reducing systolic blood pressure to <140 mm Hg results in 30%-60% reductions in CVD events; however, epidemiologic evidence suggests that lowering to optimal systolic blood pressure levels (<120 mm Hg) may be additionally beneficial. Important questions regarding prevention of CVD in patients with diabetes remain unresolved, including the benefits of near-normal glycemic control, comprehensive therapy for diabetes-related dyslipidemia, and optimal blood pressure control. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial will test hypotheses to address these unanswered questions.", 
    "61": "Most patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus develop cardiovascular disease (CVD), with substantial loss of life expectancy. Nonfatal CVD contributes greatly to excess healthcare costs and decreased quality of life in patients with diabetes. The current epidemic of obesity has raised expectations that CVD associated with type 2 diabetes will become an even greater public health challenge. Despite the importance of this health problem, there is a lack of definitive data on the effects of the intensive control of glycemia and other CVD risk factors on CVD event rates in patients with type 2 diabetes. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial is a randomized, multicenter, double 2 x 2 factorial design study involving 10,251 middle-aged and older participants with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for CVD events because of existing CVD or additional risk factors. ACCORD is testing the effects of 3 medical treatment strategies to reduce CVD morbidity and mortality. All participants are in the glycemia trial, which is testing the hypothesis that a therapeutic strategy that targets a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of <6.0% will reduce the rate of CVD events more than a strategy that targets an HbA1c level of 7.0%-7.9%. The lipid trial includes 5,518 of the participants, who receive either fenofibrate or placebo in a double-masked fashion to test the hypothesis of whether, in the context of good glycemic control, a therapeutic strategy that uses a fibrate to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels together with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol will reduce the rate of CVD events compared with a strategy that uses a statin plus a placebo. The blood pressure trial includes the remaining 4,733 participants and tests the hypothesis that a therapeutic strategy that targets a systolic blood pressure of <120 mm Hg in the context of good glycemic control will reduce the rate of CVD events compared with a strategy that targets a systolic blood pressure of <140 mm Hg. The primary outcome measure for all 3 research questions is the first occurrence of a major CVD event, specifically nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death. Upon the expected completion of participant follow-up in 2009, the ACCORD trial should document for the first time the benefits and risks of intensive glucose control, intensive blood pressure control, and the combination of fibrate and statin drugs in managing blood lipids in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes.",

This study aims to assess the effects of the ACCORD medical treatment strategies of tight control of glycemia and blood pressure and management of dyslipidemia on the course of DR in patients with type 2 diabetes. Photographs will be evaluated at a centralized location using the modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) classification. The primary outcome of ACCORD-EYE, which will measure the development and progression of DR, is a composite of (1) progression of DR (> or = 3 steps on the ETDRS scale), (2) photocoagulation for DR, or (3) vitrectomy for DR. Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: (1) Does a therapeutic strategy targeting a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) level <6.0% reduce development and progression of DR more than one targeting an HbA(1c) level of 7.0%-7.9% (target median level, 7.5%)? (2) In the context of good glycemic control, does a strategy using a fibrate to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lower triglyceride levels and a statin to maintain the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol at <2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) reduce development and progression of DR compared with one using placebo and a statin to treat LDL cholesterol? (3) In the context of good glycemic control, does a strategy targeting a systolic blood pressure level <120 mm Hg reduce development and progression of DR compared with one targeting a level <140 mm Hg? Secondary outcome variables include various levels of loss of visual acuity at 4 years versus baseline, cataract extraction, and the development or progression of diabetic macular edema.

More recent prospective observational data yield better, real-world estimates of muscle complaints (>10%) in patients started on high-dose statins. Current data suggest that important patient characteristics, statin-drug pharmacokinetics, and statin-drug interactions play a role in myopathy.

We asked if the blockade of adenosine receptors (A(1), A(2A), A(2B), or A(3) receptors) could attenuate the induction of Akt and eNOS by atorvastatin (ATV) and whether ERK1/2 is involved in the ATV regulation of Akt and eNOS. In protocol 1, mice received intraperitoneal ATV, theophylline (TH), ATV + TH, or vehicle. In protocol 2, mice received intraperitoneal injections of ATV, U0126 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor), ATV + U0126, or vehicle; 8 h later, hearts were assessed by immunoblot analysis. In protocol 3, mice received intraperitoneal ATV alone or with 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (SPT); 1, 3, and 6 h after injection, hearts were assessed by immunoblot analysis.

ATV increased P-ERK, P-PDK-1, Ser(473) P-Akt, Thr(308) P-Akt, and P-eNOS levels. TH blocked ATV-induced increases in P-ERK, Ser(473) P-Akt, Thr(308) P-Akt, and P-eNOS levels without affecting the induction of P-PDK-1 by ATV. U0126 blocked the ATV induction of Ser(473) P-Akt and Thr(308) P-Akt while attenuating the induction of P-eNOS. A detectable increase in P-ERK, Ser(473) P-Akt and P-eNOS was seen 3 and 6 h after injection but not at 1 h. DPCPX, CSC, and alloxazine partially blocked the ATV induction of P-ERK, Ser(473) P-Akt, and P-eNOS. In conclusion, blockade of adenosine A(1), A(2A), and A(2B) receptors but not A(3) receptors inhibited the induction of Akt and eNOS by statins.

In the present study, the effect of atorvastatin on left ventricular hypertrophy was investigated, and then whether the underlying mechanism was related to a defect in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis explored. Twelve spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), at 8 weeks old, were used in this study, and received either distilled water or atorvastatin for ten weeks, with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) used as controls. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to detect the mRNA and protein expressions of phospholamban (PLB) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a), respectively, and a colorimetric method used to examine the SERCA2a activity. Additionally, cardiac hypertrophic indices, such as the cardiosomatic ratio, left ventricular weight to body weight (LVW/BW) ratio and cardiomyocytes transverse diameter (TDM), together with the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and serum lipids levels were also examined. After ten weeks, significant decreases were observed in both the mRNA and protein expression levels of SERCA2a, as well as its activity, in the hypertrophied hearts of the SHR. The administration of atorvastatin to the same strains of rats effectively inhibited these decreases, and the above cardiac hypertrophic indices, as well as the SBP and serum lipids levels were significantly decreased. However, no significant changes in the expressions of PLB were observed in WKY, SHR and atorvastatin-treated SHR. These findings demonstrated that through regulation of the PLB and SERCA2a levels in the hearts of SHR, atorvastatin can prevent the cardiac hypertrophy caused due to pressure overload, which provides a relatively new insight into the mechanism of atorvastatin in the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy.",

In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.", 
    "118": "Cornoary heart disease (CHD) is identified as one of the diseases characterised by biological ageing as one of the important risk factors in several epidemiological studies. Premature biological ageing is distinct from chronological ageing and may predispose the individual to myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis and CHD in particular. The mean telomere length serves as a marker for the biological age at the cellular level, with shorter telomeres defining the increased biological age. Telomere length, therefore, correlates with the risk of CHD and atherosclerosis. Statins serve as the drugs of obvious choice based on their well established efficacy and safety profiles for the treatment of CHD and associated atherosclerosis. A present clinical study states that the treatment with a statin is associated with a reduction in the number of clinical events but only in individuals with increased risk based on their telomere length. This suggests a positive relationship of telomere length with the risk of CHD and, therefore, would help clinicians to categorise the patient populations based on their leucocyte telomere length for treatment with statins.",

Therefore, an urgent need to look for better strategies to treat this disease is imperative. Thanks to the current knowledge and ongoing research, we know the way we treat hepatitis C today will change dramatically in the next 5-10 years.

    "120": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a complex sequence of inflammatory responses that contribute to secondary injury. Statins have demonstrated neuroprotective effects against brain injury, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study evaluated the effects of lovastatin on a rat model of controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Our two hypotheses were that pre-administration of lovastatin would reduce functional deficits and extent of anatomical brain damage and that lovastatin would attenuate levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Rats were injected with lovastatin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle for 5 days and subjected to CCI. Neurological status was evaluated using rotarod and adhesive removal tests. Contusion volume and neuronal degeneration were examined using cresyl violet and FluoroJade B (FJB) histochemistry. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) mRNA and protein were assessed by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunohistochemistry. Lovastatin significantly improved performance on both the rotarod and adhesive removal tests before post-injury day 7. Lovastatin also significantly reduced contusion volume (20%) and number of FJB-positive degenerating neurons (35%) at 4 days. These changes were associated with a significant decrease in levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA and protein at the contusion site at 6 h and 4 days, respectively. Our results show that pre-administration of lovastatin improved functional outcomes and reduced extent of brain damage, with a concomitant decrease in tissue levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA and protein. These findings suggest that lovastatin's protective mechanisms may be partly attributed to a dampening of the inflammatory response.", 
    "121": "In addition to direct effects on myocardial cell function, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) contributes to adverse cardiac remodeling by increasing production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines [e.g. interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6]. Both statins and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling, possibly due to their anti-inflammatory properties. The present study examined the mechanisms by which TNFalpha stimulates expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultured human cardiac fibroblasts and determined the effects of statin or TZD treatment.",

Pharmacological inhibitors and receptor-neutralizing antibodies established that both TNFalpha-induced IL-6 and IL-1beta expression was mediated via the TNFRI receptor and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathways. In contrast, TNFalpha-induced IL-1alpha expression required both TNFRI and TNFRII subtypes and p38 MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, but was negatively regulated by the NF-kappaB pathway. Neither statins (simvastatin, fluvastatin) nor TZDs (ciglitazone, rosiglitazone, troglitazone) had inhibitory effects on TNFalpha-induced IL-6 secretion or IL-1alpha/beta mRNA expression; indeed, cytokine expression was increased in response to TZDs.",

HepG 2 cells were treated with increasing doses of pitavastatin or with mevalonic acid for 48 h. The proliferation of cells was detected with WST-8. The morphology of the nucleus was observed under a microscope by Hoechst 33258 staining. The apoptosis peaks were examined by flow cytometry. The expression of survivin mRNA was examined with RT-PCR. The caspase-3 activity was detected with caspase-3 colorimetric protease assay. We found that growth inhibitory effects were observed for treatment with pitavastatin at 10-50 microM. Pitavastatin at 10 microM induced granular apoptotic bodies of HepG 2 cells. Furthermore, pitavastatin at 10 microM increased the appearance of sub-G1 population of HepG 2 cells. Finally, pitavastatin at 10 microM downregulated the expression of survivin mRNA and upregulated the caspase-3 activity, which was clearly related to the HMG-CoA reductase activity. These results suggest that pitavastatin at 10 microM induces apoptosis of HepG 2 cells, which is associated with the decreased expression of survivin mRNA and increased caspase-3 activity of HepG 2 cells.",

    "127": "Lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is well achieved by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins). Statins inhibit the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a precursor for cholesterol and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). In HepG2 cells, simvastatin decreased mitochondrial CoQ10 levels, and at higher concentrations was associated with a moderately higher degree of cell death, increased DNA oxidative damage and a reduction in ATP synthesis. Supplementation of CoQ10, reduced cell death and DNA oxidative stress, and increased ATP synthesis. It is suggested that CoQ10 deficiency plays an important role in statin-induced hepatopathy, and that CoQ10 supplementation protects HepG2 cells from this complication.",

In this study, we seek to evaluate the effect of statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin) on the spatial learning and neurogenesis in rats subjected to controlled cortical impact. Rats were treated with atorvastatin and simvastatin 1 day after TBI and daily for 14 days. Morris water maze tests were performed during weeks 2 and 5 after TBI. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 50 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 1 day after TBI and daily for 14 days. Brain tissue was processed for immunohistochemical staining to identify newly generated cells and vessels. Our data show that (1) treatment of TBI with statins improves spatial learning on days 31-35 after onset of TBI; (2) in the non-neurogenic region of the hippocampal CA3 region, statin treatment reduces the neuronal loss after TBI, demonstrating the neuroprotective effect of statins; (3) in the neurogenic region of the dentate gyrus, treatment of TBI with statins enhances neurogenesis; (4) statin treatment augments TBI-induced angiogenesis; and (5) treatment with simvastatin at the same dose provides a therapeutic effect superior to treatment with atorvastatin.

Independently of the medication used, significant decreases in C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were detected from baseline to treatment end. CRP showed a mean reduction of 0.12 +/- 0.04 mg/dL (p = 0.002) over the 16-week intervention period and IL-6 a mean reduction was 0.35 +/- 0.17 pg/mL (p = 0.046). No change was observed in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels. Baseline values of CRP and IL-6 and their percentage declines were correlated (r = 0.71 and r = 0.67, respectively; p < 0.001).

    "134": "Arterio-arterial emboli originating from a high-grade stenosis of the internal carotid artery are a common cause for cerebral ischemias. Inflammatory processes are not only pivotal in the development of atherosclerotic vessel wall changes, but also for their clinical destabilization. Inflammatory cells, like macrophages, can turn a chronic high-grade carotid stenosis into a high-risk area for the development of arterial thromboses by way of a complex pathogenesis involving the elevation of proinflammatory factors, biosynthesis of collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinases and expression of prothrombotic tissue factor. This process could affect the occurrence of perioperative complications during carotid endarterectomies. Statins are potent cholesterol-lowering agents. Among other lipid-independent effects, statins appear to play a significant role in preventing cardiovascular events. A number of studies have shown that statins possess plaque-stabilizing effects and that they improve cerebral autoregulation. A growing evidence supports the preoperative administration of statins in patients with high-grade stenoses of the internal carotid artery.",

Of the 6 published trials of statins for primary prevention, only 3 included subjects aged >75 years, and subgroup results in older adults are unavailable. Current guidelines recommend statins for individuals based on their assessed cardiovascular risk.", 
    "144": "Extension of treatment guidelines should consider an individual's global risk of coronary heart disease. However, due to the prevalence of subclinical disease in older adults, risk may be higher or otherwise differ with age. In addition, tolerance for and barriers to adherence with long-term medical therapy are important treatment considerations in older adults. Prospective, randomized controlled trials that better define the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of statin therapy in older adults with elevated cholesterol levels and intermediate cardiovascular risk are needed.",

The efficacy of existing drugs, such as carvedilol, for rate control and, possibly, suppression of AF, is more appreciated. Efforts are being made to modify existing agents, such as amiodarone, in an attempt to ameliorate safety and adverse effect concerns. This has resulted in promising data from the deiodinated amiodarone analog, dronedarone, and further work with celivarone and ATI-2042. In an attempt to minimize ventricular proarrhythmia, atrial selective drugs, such as intravenous vernakalant, have demonstrated efficacy in terminating AF in addition to promising data in suppression recurrences when used orally. Several other atrial selective drugs are being developed by multiple manufacturers. Other novel therapeutic mechanisms, such as drugs that enhance GAP junction conduction, are being developed to achieve more effective drug therapy than is offered by existing compounds. Finally, nonantiarrhythmic drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, high-mobility group coenzyme A enzyme inhibitors and omega-3 fatty acids/fish oil, appear to have a role in suppressing AF in certain patient subtypes. Future studies will clarify the role of these drugs in treating AF.",

The study sample consisted of patients who had had no statin use during the year preceding the index hospitalization and had at least 6 months of follow-up after discharge. Initiation of any statin prescription during follow-up was the outcome of interest. Demographic and clinical predictors were selected with the guidance of Andersen's health services utilization model and past studies. Effects of these independent variables on statin initiation were examined using logistic regression models.", 
    "163": "Of 17,631 subjects who met the inclusion criteria, only 8,424 (7.8%) had received statin therapy within 6 months after discharge. The following characteristics were inversely related to the likelihood of receiving an outpatient statin: baseline Charlson comorbidity score (6+ vs. 1-2, odds ratio [OR] 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.51), nonacute myocardial infarction CHD hospitalization (OR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.51-0.58), baseline psychoses (OR 0.61; 95% CI, 0.50-0.75), use of lipid-modifying drugs other than statins at baseline (OR 0.61; 95% CI, 0.53-0.71), and patient age (continuous) (OR 0.97; 95% CI, 0.97-0.98). The following characteristics were associated with a higher likelihood of receiving an outpatient statin prescription: hospitalization for CHD in a recent year (2003 vs. 2000, OR 1.77; 95% CI, 1.61-1.94), baseline dyslipidemia (OR 1.54; 95% CI, 1.41-1.68), care by a cardiologist (OR 1.26; 95% CI, 1.18-1.34), and male gender (OR 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10-1.26). In a separate analysis of subjects with complete copayment information (N=13,765), amount of copayment for the first outpatient statin prescription was inversely related to the likelihood of receiving an outpatient statin (>or=$20 vs. <$10; OR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.56-0.68). In that equation, hospitalization for CHD in 2003 instead of in 2000 multiplied the odds of receiving statin therapy after discharge by 3.31 (95% CI, 2.95-3.71).",

For CHD patients admitted in 2003, the odds of receiving statin therapy after discharge were approximately 80% to 230% higher than for patients admitted in 2000. Higher statin copayment amount and female gender were associated with lower likelihood of receiving a statin prescription after a CHD hospitalization.",

    "166": "A brief review of the epidemiology of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and of controlled clinical trials of pharmacologic therapy of these conditions in decreasing cardiovascular events is presented.", 
    "167": "Risk factors for CVD generally do not occur in isolation, and the co-occurrence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, with or without other additional risk factors, greatly increases the risk of CVD. Clinical trials performed in the last 40 years have demonstrated the clinical benefit of treating hypertension and dyslipidemia. Recent trials have shown that intensive, early management of these risk factors provide the greatest clinical benefits. Emerging evidence suggests that lipid management provides clinical benefit in patients at high risk of CVD, regardless of their baseline cholesterol levels, and that lipid-lowering with statin therapy provides additional benefits over antihypertensive therapy alone in high-risk patients with hypertension. It has become evident that the most effective means of reducing CVD risk is the simultaneous management of all modifiable risk factors. Treatment of an individual risk factor can reduce CVD events by approximately 30%, whereas treatment of multiple risk factors can reduce the risk of CVD by more than 50%. However, a large number of patients are not treated or receive suboptimal treatment.", 
    "168": "Overwhelming controlled clinical trial evidence supports the clinical benefit of treating hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Fixed-dose combination medications for hypertension, and integrative combination therapies containing antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications in a single pill contribute to better risk factor management with the potential for greater adherence and improved clinical outcomes.", 
    "169": "We have investigated regulation of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) in one of the most salt-tolerant fungi, Hortaea werneckii, under different salinities and at the level of protein degradation. Two different HwHMGR isoenzymes were identified, specific to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum: HwHmg1 and HwHmg2, respectively. The activity of microsomal HwHmg2 is highest under hypo-saline and extremely hyper-saline conditions, and down-regulated under optimal growth conditions. We show that this is due to intense ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HwHmg2. The activity of the truncated mitochondrial HwHmg1 is constant under different growth conditions, suggesting an osmoadaptation-directed fate for mevalonate utilization in H. werneckii.", 
    "170": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the beneficial effects of Atorvastatin and Simvastatin in cognitive dysfunctions of rats. Alprazolam, Scopolamine and high fat diet (HFD) induced amnesia served as interoceptive memory models where as, Water-maze and Elevated plus-maze served as exteroceptive models. A total of 38 groups of rats were used in this investigation. Escape latency time (ELT) recorded during acquisition trials conducted from day 1 to day 4, in water maze was taken as an index of acquisition, where as mean time spent in target quadrant during retrieval trial on day 5, was taken as the index of retrieval (memory). On elevated plus-maze, transfer latency (TL) measured on 1st d served as the index of acquisition and TL recorded on 2nd d was taken as the index of retrieval (memory). Alprazolam (0.5 mg kg(-1) intraperitoneally), Scopolamine (0.4 mg kg(-1) intraperitoneally) and HFD treated (for 90 days) rats exhibited amnesia as reflected by impairment in learning ability as well as memory, when tested on both, water maze and elevated plus maze. Atorvastatin (5 mg kg(-1) orally) as well as Simvastatin (5 mg kg(-1) orally) significantly attenuated Alprazolam, Scopolamine and HFD induced amnesia. These results highlight the ameliorative role of statins in experimental amnesia with possible involvement of their cholesterol dependent as well as cholesterol independent actions.", 
    "171": "Benidipine, which is a calcium channel blocker that has clinical advantages in the treatment of hypertension, is metabolized by CYP3A4 in humans. The effect of benidipine on the metabolism of simvastatin by human liver microsomes was investigated in order to predict the potential of in vivo drug-drug interactions between benidipine and other substrates of CYP3A4. The results were compared with data generated with azelnidipine, which is also metabolized by CYP3A4. Both benidipine and azelnidipine inhibited simvastatin metabolism in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. Assuming competitive inhibition, the K(i) values based on the unbound concentrations, were calculated to be 0.846 and 0.0181 microM for benidipine and azelnidipine, respectively. If simvastatin (10 mg) and benidipine (8 mg, the clinically recommended highest dose) were to be administered concomitantly, the ratio of the areas under the concentration-time curves of simvastatin with and without benidipine (AUC((+I))/AUC) was predicted to be 1.01. On the other hand, if simvastatin (10 mg) and azelnidipine (8 mg) were co-administered, the AUC((+I))/AUC for simvastatin was predicted to be 1.72, which is close to the observed value (1.9) in healthy volunteers. These data suggest that benidipine is unlikely to cause a drug interaction by inhibiting CYP3A4 activity in the liver.", 
    "172": "In this work a simple kinetic model to describe the biosynthesis of lovastatin by Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 was proposed. Several series of experiments were conducted at different media compositions. The concentrations of C- and N-sources were changed over a wide range and so were the initial biomass concentrations. From these runs the relationships ruling the substrates uptake, biomass and product formation were learnt. Lovastatin biosynthesis appeared to be partly growth associated. The inhibitive effect of organic nitrogen on lovastatin biosynthesis was found and lactose appeared to be an important limiting substrate in the formation of lovastatin. The parameters of the model were evaluated on the basis of the kinetic data obtained in the separate experiments made in triplicate at two chosen media compositions. Other results obtained at different media compositions were independent of the ones mentioned above and used for the verification of the model. The validity of the model was also examined for the lactose-fed fed-batch run. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was performed. The formulated model, although relatively simplified, described the experimental data quite well and could be regarded as the background for further attempts to mathematically describe the process of lovastatin biosynthesis.", 
    "173": "Prostasomes are vesicles secreted by epithelial cells of the prostate gland. However, little is known about the mechanism and the regulation of prostasome secretion. Since endocytic organelles may be involved in prostasome release, PC-3-derived prostasomes were investigated by Western blot analysis for the presence of marker proteins normally associated with these organelles. Prostasomes secreted by PC-3 cells contain clathrin, Tsg101, Hrs, Rab11, Rab5, LAMP-1, LAMP-2, LAMP-3/CD63, and annexin II. Moreover, electron microscopy of PC-3 cells revealed the presence of characteristic multivesicular body-like secretory lysosomes containing vesicles with the same size-distribution as released prostasomes. Ultrastructural immunogold labelling showed that LAMP-1, LAMP-2 and LAMP-3/CD63 were associated with these vesicles. In addition, we have investigated whether cholesterol plays a role in prostasome release by the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Interestingly, prostasome release was significantly increased when the cholesterol levels of PC-3 cells were reduced by the cholesterol-sequestering agent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD), or by treatment with lovastatin and mevalonate. In conclusion, these studies indicate that cholesterol plays an important role in the release of prostasomes by the human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, and suggest that prostasomes may be released after fusion of secretory lysosomes with the plasma membrane.", 
    "174": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) account for an enormous disease burden, especially in the Western world. Patients suffering acute coronary events are now understood to carry a very high risk of further coronary events and although improvements in conventional medical therapy over the past two decades have significantly reduced the risk, it remains high. Therapy with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have now been well established for the primary and secondary prevention of stable coronary heart disease, but recently a substantial body of evidence has proven their efficacy in the treatment of ACS. This article examines this emerging evidence for the use of statins in ACS.", 
    "175": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are the first-line treatment for dyslipidemia and the results of large statin trials have a significant impact on guidelines for cardiovascular disease (CVD) management, such as those set by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel. The benefit of statin therapy in CVD prevention has traditionally been demonstrated in clinical trials by the superior efficacy of statins vs placebo in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and preventing hard coronary heart disease (CHD) outcomes including myocardial infarction and CHD death. However, due to earlier and improved treatment of CVD, the clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis are changing and other forms of CVD are now thought to predominate (such as revascularization and stroke). These changes in how CVD manifests in the patient population may have consequences for selection of endpoints when designing future clinical trials. Recent statin trials have also demonstrated the early and improved clinical benefit of lowering LDL-C beyond traditional goals with intensive statin therapy vs more moderate lipid-lowering therapy. This review assesses the impact of early statin trials on current CVD management guidelines, summarizes results of recent landmark statin trials, and evaluates the potential implications of these studies for future clinical trials and CVD management guidelines.", 
    "176": "The ultimate goal of antihypertensive therapy is cardiovascular risk reduction. As lowering blood pressure per se reduces risk for myocardial infarction only by 20%-25%, it is obvious that a better protection is needed. An optimal strategy to reduce risk in hypertensives may include lifestyle modification, promotion of adherence to therapy, early and aggressive target levels achievement by appropriate drug choice. Clinical trial data suggest that RAAS blockers can reduce the risk at least partly independently of BP lowering. In addition, as hypertension is associated with a constellation of other risk factors, the global risk reduction is nowadays going to become the gold standard in therapy. The most common and important coexisting risk factor is hypercholesterolemia. This is not simply a co-existence but there is an independent and causal relationship between lipids and hypertension and there is a physiologic rationale and evidence for statins use especially in patients with complicated hypertension or in patients with more than two risk factors. So, whilst blood pressure lowering is undoubtedly beneficial, we have to focus on the global cardiovascular risk. We must go beyond blood pressure and the most effective way to go \"beyond BP\" is to add a statin."
