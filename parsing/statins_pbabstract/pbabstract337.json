In humans long term administration of these drugs leads to decrease of levels of markers of inflammation notably of C-reactive protein. Possible mechanisms of anti-inflammatory action of statins include activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha. Indirect evidence exists from studies with clinical end points that statins are effective in patients with elevated initial level of C-reactive protein (CARE) and that this phenomenon occurs irrespective of the initial LDL CH level (AFCAPS) and its changes during statin therapy. Thus administration of statins apparently is an intervention capable to selectively modify the harmful components of inflammation in the arteries and to create new avenue for the management of patients with cardiovascular disease who do not have hypercholesterolemia (R.Ross).", 
    "1": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis that is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular mortality and significant limitation in function because of limb ischemia. Patients with PAD should be considered to have significant coronary and cerebral arterial disease that requires aggressive risk factor management, including the prescription of antiplatelet drugs, to lower the subsequent risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. In the population with PAD, level 1 and level 2 evidence supports the use of statin drugs for lipid management, angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 inhibitors for blood pressure control, and aspirin or clopidogrel as antiplatelet agents. Once this is accomplished, the severity of limb symptoms should be assessed, and a structured exercise program or the selected use of drugs such as cilostazol to treat claudication should be prescribed. In patients primarily considered for surgical treatment, antiplatelet and anticoagulant drug therapy can be used as a means of promoting graft patency, and beta-adrenergic blockers can be used as a means of reducing the perioperative risks associated with vascular surgery.",

Three days later, neurological deficits were scored (5 to 27; 27=normal), and middle cerebral artery diameter and eNOS protein were measured. The study was repeated, but simvastatin treatment was started after SAH or sham surgery.",

Pretreatment reduced neurological deficits (SAH-simvastatin=25+/-2, SAH-vehicle=20+/-2, P=0.005; sham-simvastatin and sham-vehicle=27+/-0). Simvastatin pretreatment also increased eNOS protein.

    "6": "Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype modulates the risk of Alzheimer's disease. ApoE has been shown essential for amyloid beta-peptide fibrillogenesis and deposition, a defining pathological feature of this disease. Because astrocytes and microglia represent the major source of extracellular apoE in brain, we investigated apoE secretion by glia. We determined that protein prenylation is required for apoE release from a continuous microglial cell line, primary mixed glia, and from organotypic hippocampal cultures. Using selective protein prenylation inhibitors, apoE secretion was found to require protein geranylgeranylation. This prenylation involved a protein critical to apoE secretion, not apoE proper. ApoE secretion could also be suppressed by inhibiting synthesis of mevalonate, the precursor to both types of protein prenylation, using hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Recent reports have described the beneficial effects of statins on the risk of dementia. Our finding that protein geranylgeranylation is required for apoE secretion in the brain parenchyma provides another contributing mechanism to explain the effective properties of statins against the development of dementia. In this model, statin-mediated inhibition of mevalonate synthesis, an essential reaction in forming geranylgeranyl lipid, would lower extracellular levels of parenchymal apoE. Because apoE has been found necessary for plaque development in transgenic models of Alzheimer's disease, suppressing apoE secretion by statins could reduce plaques and, in turn, improve cognitive function.", 
    "7": "The use of combination therapy is an effective way to manage dyslipidemia in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, combination therapy is not a frequently used strategy in the treatment of CAD. Aggressive lipid-altering therapy often requires the use of combination therapy involving statins in conjunction with niacin, fibric-acid derivatives, ezetimibe, or bile acid resins. Yet, safety concerns regarding the combination of statins with other lipid-altering drugs and patient acceptance of combination therapy have influenced its application in the treatment of CAD. This article discusses several safety and regulatory considerations for the use of combination therapy for dyslipidemia.", 
    "8": "Combination drug therapy has been used in the management of dyslipidemia by lipid clinics since the early 1980s. The explosion of statin use in the early and mid-1990s has caused a shift to monotherapy for dyslipidemia. However, the use of combination therapy has reemerged as a treatment option for patients who have elevated triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels as more attention is now focused on non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This article discusses the use of combination therapy in a lipid clinic based on experiences from a multisite clinical practice of >48 physicians and 80,000 patients. Approaches to LDL lowering for complex dyslipidemias and management strategies for specific lipid-lowering therapies are provided.", 
    "9": "For the past 3 to 4 decades, clinical outcomes trials have shown that drugs that favorably alter serum lipid levels reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) events. However, despite these successes, the reduction in serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with monotherapy lipid-altering drugs does not \"cure\" CAD to the same degree that antibiotics \"cure\" many infections, nor do they \"prevent\" CAD in the same way that childhood immunizations \"prevent\" the onset of such conditions as measles, mumps, and rubella. Clinical outcome trials of monotherapy lipid-altering drugs have demonstrated a reduction in the relative risk of CAD in only a minority of patients. Thus, although safe and very effective in lowering serum LDL cholesterol levels, drugs that predominantly lower cholesterol do not \"cure\" atherosclerotic disease, nor have they been shown to \"prevent\" most CAD events in numerous clinical outcome trials. The reason for the suboptimal CAD outcomes benefits of monotherapy lipid-altering drugs is likely because atherosclerosis is a complex pathologic process with many important risk factors involved in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions and involved in the onset of the CAD event itself. An elevated serum LDL cholesterol level is an important CAD risk factor, but it is not the only lipid risk factor. A decreased serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level is another important risk factor for CAD. Combination therapy through existing drugs (or possibly, in the future, through investigational lipid-altering drugs) may not only improve LDL cholesterol but also improve serum HDL cholesterol levels. This more global, multidimensional approach to lipid-altering drug treatment may provide the best chance to prevent CAD.", 
    "10": "Patients with combined dyslipidemia are at high risk for coronary artery disease and often require combination drug therapy to achieve lipid levels recommended by the US National Cholesterol Education Program's third Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III). In addition to recommendations for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels, ATP III established non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol goals for individuals with triglycerides >or=2.26 mmol/L (>or=200 mg/dL). It also introduced certain criteria for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome, a clustering of risk factors (abdominal obesity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, impaired fasting glucose) that increases cardiovascular risk and is common in patients with combined dyslipidemia. Statin monotherapy has been shown to benefit these patients, and additional benefit may be obtained by combination therapy that provides greater reductions in both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides as well as greater increases in HDL cholesterol. However, combining a statin with either niacin or a fibrate may increase the risk for myopathy and therefore requires careful monitoring and evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio for each patient. Moreover, combination therapy may be associated with increased drug costs and decreased patient compliance. Recently developed agents that may improve the effectiveness of combination therapy include ezetimibe-a cholesterol absorption inhibitor-and a formulation that combines extended-release niacin and lovastatin in a single pill. Clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal treatment in patients with combined dyslipidemia.", 
    "11": "Lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a key management principle in reducing the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). An aggressive approach to CAD risk reduction requires multiple therapeutic strategies, as no single approach is likely to succeed independently. The use of combination therapy for elevated LDL cholesterol is effective for CAD risk reduction. In fact, the majority of patients with CAD are unlikely to achieve their treatment goals with monotherapy. This article reviews the use of combination therapy for the management of elevated LDL cholesterol, highlighting important therapy considerations.", 
    "12": "The use of combination lipid-altering therapy for dyslipidemia is becoming increasingly important for effective management of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). In accordance with the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, the primary target of therapy is lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Studies have demonstrated the benefit of LDL cholesterol reduction in decreasing CHD event rates and all-cause mortality. However, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol remains a significant predictor of CHD events. In addition, lipid-lowering therapy targeting aberrant lipoprotein subclass and triglyceride levels afford additional benefit for patients with mixed dyslipidemias. Aggressive lipid-altering therapy often requires the use of combination therapy involving statins in conjunction with niacin, fibric-acid derivatives, or bile acid resins or intestinal inhibitors of active cholesterol transport. This article reviews the rationale for the use of combination therapy in the treatment of dyslipidemia, highlighting management strategies.", 
    "13": "Therapeutic success of statins has distinctly established inhibition of de novo hepatic cholesterol synthesis as an effective approach to lower plasma LDL-cholesterol, the major risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Statins inhibit HMG CoA reductase, a rate limiting enzyme which catalyses conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid. However, in this process statins also inhibit the synthesis of several non-sterols e.g. dolichols and ubiquinone, which are implicated in side effects observed with statins. This prompted many major pharmaceutical companies in 1990s to target selective cholesterol synthesis beyond farnesyl pyrophosphate. The enzymes squalene synthetase, squalene epoxidase and oxidosqualene cyclase were identified as potential targets. Though inhibitors of these enzymes have been developed, till date no compound has been reported to have entered clinical trials. We evaluated the literature to understand merits and demerits of pursuing squalene epoxidase as a target for hypocholesterolemic drug development. Squalene epoxidase catalyses the conversion of squalene to 2,3-oxidosqualene. Although it has been extensively exploited for antifungal drug development, it has received little attention as a target for hypocholesterolemic drug design. This enzyme though recognized in the early 1970s was cloned 25 years later. This enzyme is an attractive step for pharmacotherapeutic intervention as it is the secondary rate limiting enzyme and blocking cholesterol synthesis at this step may result in accumulation of only squalene which is known to be stable and non toxic. Synthesis of several potent, orally bioavailable inhibitors of squalene epoxidase has been reported from Yamonuchi, Pierre Fabre and Banyu pharmaceuticals. Preclinical studies with these inhibitors have clearly demonstrated the potential of squalene epoxidase inhibitors as hypocholesterolemic agents. Hypochloesterolemic therapy is intended for prolonged duration and safety is an important determinant in clinical success. Lack of clinical trials, despite demonstrated preclinical efficacy by oral route, prompted us to evaluate safety concerns with squalene epoxidase inhibitors. In dogs, NB-598, a potent competitive squalene epoxidase inhibitor has been reported to exhibit signs of dermatitis like toxicity which has been attributed by some reviewers to accumulation of squalene in skin cells. Tellurium, a non-competitive inhibitor of squalene epoxidase has been associated with neuropathy in weanling rats. On the other hand, increased plasma levels of squalene in animals and humans (such as occurring subsequent to dietary olive oil or squalene administration) are safe and associated with beneficial effect such as chemoprevention and hypocholesterolemic activity. In our view, high circulating levels of squalene epoxidase inhibitor may be responsible for dermatitis and neuropathy. Competitive inhibition and pharmacokinetic profile minimizing circulating plasma levels (e.g. by hepatic sequestration and high first pass metabolism) could be important determinants in circumventing safety concerns of squalene epoxidase inhibitors. Recently, cholesterol-lowering effect of green tea has been attributed to potent squalene epoxidase inhibition, which can be consumed in much higher doses without toxicological effect. These facts strengthen optimism for developing clinically safe squalene epoxidase inhibitors. Put in perspective squalene epoxidase appears to be undervalued target which merits attention for development of better hypocholesterolemic drugs.", 
    "14": "The retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORalpha) is an orphan member of the subfamily 1 of nuclear hormone receptors. No X-ray structure of RORalpha has been described so far, and no ligand has been identified. We describe the first crystal structure of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of RORalpha, at 1.63 A resolution. This structure revealed a ligand present in the ligand binding pocket (LBP), which was identified by X-ray crystallography as cholest-5-en-3beta-ol (cholesterol). Moreover, RORalpha transcriptional activity could be modulated by changes in intracellular cholesterol level or mutation of residues involved in cholesterol binding. These findings suggest that RORalpha could play a key role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and thus represents an important drug target in cholesterol-related diseases.",

Various syn-1,3-diols were prepared conveniently by reduction of beta-alkoxy ketones with LiI/LiAlH(4) (syn:anti selectivity up to >99:1). The corresponding beta-alkoxy ketones were derived from nitro-aldol reactions of chiral alkoxy aldehydes with a series of nitro compounds. This methodology is utilized in a short and efficient synthesis of the delta-lactone moiety of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors compactin and mevinolin.", 
    "16": "The hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin is used widely to treat hypercholesterolemia and has been shown to have cell cycle-specific effects. In these studies, we have examined the effects of combining lovastatin and paclitaxel (Taxol), a microtubule-stabilizing agent, in the human leukemia K562 and HL-60 cell lines. Isobologram analysis of cytotoxicity assays revealed that there is a synergistic interaction between the two agents in both cell lines. Cell cycle analyses showed that lovastatin enhances paclitaxel-induced G2-M arrest in both cell lines. In addition, Annexin V apoptotic studies revealed that lovastatin enhances paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Lovastatin did not affect levels of [3H]paclitaxel in cells. Whereas lovastatin induced an accumulation of unmodified Ras and caused an up-regulation of both RhoB and Rap1A, paclitaxel was found to have no effect on the isoprenylated proteins. Studies of the centromere-associated protein mitosin revealed that treatment with lovastatin and paclitaxel resulted in increased mitosin levels and that lovastatin altered the association of mitosin with condensed chromosomes. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the cell cycle effects of lovastatin and support the development of a novel therapeutic strategy directed toward altering deleterious cell proliferation.", 
    "17": "The objective of this study was to determine the effect of slow-release (XL) fluvastatin on low density lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions in type 2 diabetes. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group comparison of fluvastatin XL 80 mg (n = 42) and placebo (n = 47), each given once-daily for 8 wk, in 89 patients with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c: 7.2 +/- 1.0%, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C): 3.4 +/- 0.7 mmol/liter, high density lipoprotein cholesterol: 1.1 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter, and triglycerides (TG): 2.4 +/- 1.4 mmol/liter). At baseline and on treatment, plasma lipoproteins were isolated and quantified. Eight weeks of fluvastatin treatment decreased total cholesterol (-23.0%, P < 0.001), LDL-C (-29%, P < 0.001) and TG (-18%, P < 0.001), compared with placebo. At baseline, there was a preponderance of dense LDL (dLDL) (apolipoprotein B in LDL-5 plus LDL-6 > 25 mg/dl) in 79% of patients, among whom fluvastatin decreased all LDL subfractions, reductions in dLDL being greatest (-28%, P = 0.001; cholesterol in dLDL -29%). In patients with low baseline dLDL (apolipoprotein B in LDL-5 plus LDL-6 </= 25 mg/dl), but a preponderance of buoyant LDL (LDL-1 through LDL-3), fluvastatin significantly decreased only these subfractions. Fluvastatin 80 mg XL, once daily, decreased total cholesterol and total LDL-C. In patients with atherogenic dLDL, absolute changes of dLDL were most pronounced, emphasizing the value of fluvastatin treatment in type 2 diabetes. The antiatherogenic potential of fluvastatin in type 2 diabetes may thus be greater than that expected from its effects on LDL-C and TG alone.", 
    "18": "The effect of rosuvastatin on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin was assessed in 18 healthy male volunteers in this double-blind, randomized, two-way crossover trial. Volunteers were dosed with rosuvastatin (40 mg once daily) or placebo to steady state before being given a single dose of digoxin 0.5 mg. Blood and urine samples for the measurement of serum and urine digoxin concentrations were collected up to 96 hours following dosing. The effect of rosuvastatin was assessed by constructing 90% confidence intervals (CIs) around the treatment ratios (rosuvastatin + digoxin/placebo + digoxin) for digoxin exposure. The geometric least square mean AUC(0-t) and Cmax of digoxin were only 4% higher when the drug was coadministered with rosuvastatin compared to placebo. The 90% CIs for both treatment ratios (AUC(0-t) = 0.88-1.24; Cmax = 0.89-1.22) fell within the prespecified margin of 0.74 to 1.35; therefore, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction occurred between rosuvastatin and digoxin. The geometric mean amount of digoxin excreted into the urine and its renal clearance were similar with rosuvastatin and placebo. These results demonstrate that rosuvastatin has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin. Coadministration of rosuvastatin and digoxin was well tolerated.",

Unlike other statins, atorvastatin exhibits a decline in its HDL-raising effect at higher doses in humans. Whether atorvastatin-mediated alterations in HDL turnover in vivo contribute to this effect has not previously been investigated. We therefore studied the effect of atorvastatin on HDL apolipoprotein (apo) A-I production and clearance in normolipidemic male New Zealand White rabbits.",

Patients treated with statins had diminished sCD40L plasma levels compared with untreated control patients (8.3+/-3.1 ng/mL [n=11] versus 13.1+/-2.5 ng/mL [n=16], P<0.05), supporting the clinical relevance of the in vitro observations. Platelet-enriched plasma of mice deficient in CD40L showed markedly delayed fibrin clot formation, suggesting a role for the ligand in blood coagulation and supporting the hypothesis that statin-mediated reduction in CD40/CD40L expression might limit thrombosis.",

In addition to inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, statins also inhibit the synthesis of other sterol and non-sterol compounds produced by the pathway including the isoprenoids, farnesyl (FP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGP). Certain proteins, most notably small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily, must be post-translationally modified by addition of a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moiety in order to be properly targeted to membranes and to be active. Statins have been shown to affect cellular processes such as proliferation, signaling and apoptosis and it is likely that these effects are due, at least in part, to decreased isoprenoid synthesis. Certain statins have been shown to produce cataracts in experimental animals. We have previously demonstrated that lenses exposed to lovastatin during organ culture may develop cataracts as well, and we proposed that this resulted from decreased prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins. To test our hypothesis, rat lenses were exposed to lovastatin in organ culture with concomitant supplementation of the medium with GGP and/or FP. The results clearly demonstrated that GGP strongly inhibited lovastatin-induced lens opacification in this system while FP had little effect. GGP also markedly reduced the histological changes and the increased epithelial cell apoptosis induced in the cultured lenses by lovastatin. The data indicate that inhibition of protein prenylation, perhaps of Rho GTPases, is an important factor in the lovastatin-induced cataract in vitro.",

Although Drosophila cannot synthesize cholesterol de novo, the regulatory role of fly AMPK on HMG-CoA reductase is conserved. The loe phenotype is modified by the level of HMG-CoA reductase and suppressed by the inhibition of this enzyme by statin, which has been used for the treatment of Alzheimer patients. In addition, the degenerative phenotype of loe is enhanced by a mutation in amyloid precursor protein-like (APPL), the fly homolog of the human amyloid precursor protein involved in Alzheimer's disease. Western analysis revealed that the loe mutation reduces APPL processing, whereas overexpression of Loe increases it.

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin therapy on the erythrocyte membrane structure and the hypolipemic efficacy in patients with FH. MATERIALS, METHODS AND SUBJECTS STUDIED:. The study involved 31 patients with FH and 20 healthy individuals as a control group. The program lasted 20 weeks. For the first 8 weeks, the patients were on a hypolipemic diet only and for the subsequent 12 weeks, alongside the diet they were given 10 mg atorvastatin per day. Laboratory tests were carried out before and after 4 weeks and 12 weeks of the pharmacological treatment. Erythrocyte membrane fluidity was determined using the spin labeled method. The peroxidation of lipids was measured in whole erythrocytes as well as in erythrocyte plasma membranes by means of the thiobarbituric acid technique.",

Treatment with atorvastatin reduced serum total cholesterol concentration from 310+/-29 mg/dl in a basal situation to 203+/-34 mg/dl ( P<0.001) at the end of the treatment and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration from 225+/-30 mg/dl to 126+/-30 mg/dl ( P<0.001), respectively. The changes observed in the plasma lipids correlate with a significant decrease in erythrocyte membrane cholesterol, from 2.24+/-1.69 to 1.17+/-0.75 mg/mg protein ( P<0.001) after 12 weeks of treatment. The lipid peroxidation in membranes of erythrocytes was lowered from the basal value 0.171+/-0.097 to 0.100+/-0.024 mmol/mg protein ( P<0.05) after 4 weeks of treatment and to 0.057+/-0.020 mmol/mg protein ( P<0.001) after 12 weeks of treatment, and in total erythrocytes from 4.78+/-1.49 to 3.99+/-1.39 mmol/g Hb ( P<0.02) and 2.43+/-0.87 mmol/g Hb ( P<0.001), respectively.

    "92": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Recent evidence indicates that statins may also exert direct effects on vascular wall cells (including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells) independently of their hypocholesterolemic properties. However, little is known about whether statins have direct effects on myocardium. The effect of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins (fluvastatin and pravastatin) on apoptosis and protein synthesis in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes was investigated. The presence of apoptosis was evaluated by morphologic criteria, electrophoresis of DNA fragments, 4\",6\"-diamidine-2\"-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, and TUNEL assay. Protein synthesis was measured by H-leucine incorporation into the cells. Fluvastatin, but not pravastatin, induced apoptosis in cardiac myocytes in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The pro-apoptotic effect of fluvastatin was reversed in the presence of mevalonate or geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not in the presence of squalene. The addition of protein prenylation inhibitor perillic acid and Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632 significantly increased apoptosis. Fluvastatin decreased RhoA protein in the membrane fraction, whereas there were no significant changes of the RhoA protein in the cytosol fraction. Interleukin-1beta-stimulated H-leucine incorporation was completely inhibited by fluvastatin, but not by pravastatin. The findings suggest that fluvastatin induces apoptosis in cardiac myocytes via protein prenylation and the subsequent inhibition of Rho, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling.", 
    "93": "Epidemiologic studies have shown that hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased left ventricular (LV) mass. Free radicals have been shown to be increased in hyperlipidemic patients. This study sought to determine whether pravastatin administration can affect LV mass in patients with untreated total cholesterol >or=240 mg/dl by reducing 8-iso-prostaglandin F concentrations, a reliable marker of oxidant injury. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, one with (n = 25) and one without (n = 25) treatment with pravastatin (10 or 20 mg/d). A group of normolipidemic control subjects was used for comparison. Echocardiograms were performed at baseline and after 6 months of therapy. Hyperlipidemic patients showed significant increases in LV mass index at baseline compared with the normolipidemic control group (125 +/- 8 vs. 107 +/- 5 g/m, p < 0.0001). Pravastatin treatment significantly reduced plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as well as increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After 6 months of therapy with pravastatin, the magnitude of LV mass regression correlated with the magnitude of inhibition of free radical formation assessed by 8-iso-prostaglandin F formation (r = 0.67, p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that regression of LV mass was significantly correlated only with the changes in 8-iso-prostaglandin F (p < 0.0001, adjusted R = 0.83). These findings demonstrated for the first time that in addition to its primary anti-lipidemia, pravastatin may have an additional effect of reducing LV mass-independent lipid-lowering effects, possibly through attenuation of free radical formation.", 
    "94": "In this communication, the altered homeostatic theory will be discussed and updated, and evidence will be presented that the premises of the theory might permit improvement of the prevention of ischemic heart disease (IHD). This hypothesis, first described in 1999, argues that IHD is due basically to an inappropriate shift of homeostasis, and the theory includes the position that S-RV directly induces symptoms. In contrast, the standard approach to IHD is based fundamentally on two principles: that atherosclerosis is due fundamentally to lipid abnormalities, and that symptoms in IHD are due to obstructive complications of atherosclerosis in epicardial coronary arteries. Suggestions for prevention stem from the altered homeostatic theory's different basic conceptualization of this disorder, and it seems reasonable that accepted basic pathogenetic mechanisms help shape measures to prevent IHD. Many of the theory's positions for preventing IHD parallel standard views, but the theory's basic premises have resulted in significant differences between the standard and the theory's overall approach to the prevention of IHD. Positions for the prevention of IHD include: the possibility that any preventative factor can improve any risk factor, the use of substitute preventative factors to counter unmodifiable or difficult to correct risk factors, underestimation of the risk of IHD by the standard position in individuals with normal lipid levels but multiple other risk factors, the probable relative overemphasis of the risk factor of cholesterol, the value of a national program to reduce the incidence of multiple disorders with similar risk factors, an alternate approach to the use of statins, and the value of an evolutionary approach to preventing IHD and other disorders.",

It has been previously suggested that IPP or IPP-derived products can be exchanged between the cytoplasm and plastids. However, the issue of whether the exchanged products reflect efficient synthesis of functional isoprenoids remains unresolved. We fed exogenous mevalonic acid to the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. albino mutant cla1-1, a null mutant of the first-step enzyme in the MEP pathway. This resulted in the recovery of thylakoid membrane stacking in chloroplasts in the light, and the formation of prolamellar bodies and plastoglobuli in etioplasts in the dark. By contrast, exogenous lovastatin, an inhibitor of mevalonic acid biosynthesis, induced complete depigmentation and further inhibition of plastid development in both the light and the dark. These results suggest that mevalonic acid-derived products contribute to the formation of functional plastidic isoprenoids, such as the chlorophylls and carotenoids required for plastid development.",

The annualized change in AVA was -0.09 +/- 0.17 cm(2)/year (-7% +/- 13%/year). Neither total cholesterol (r = -0.01, p = 0.92) nor low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.01; p = 0.88) showed a significant correlation to AS progression.

The decrease in plasma triglyceride concentration and post-Triton very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride concentration, a measure of hepatic triglyceride secretion, by atorvastatin (30 mg/kg p.o.) for 2 weeks was to approximately the same degree as those by BMS-201038 (0.3 mg/kg). Atorvastatin (30 mg/kg) increased hepatic beta-oxidation activity by 54% (P < 0.01), while BMS-201038 (0.3 mg/kg) had no significant effect. Atorvastatin decreased hepatic triglyceride, fatty acid and cholesteryl ester concentrations by 21% to 39%, whereas BMS-201038 increased these variables by 28% to 307%. In the atorvastatin-treated groups, a significant relationship was seen not only between hepatic beta-oxidation activity and hepatic triglyceride concentration (R(2) = 0.535, P < 0.01), but also between hepatic and plasma triglyceride concentrations (R(2) = 0.586, P < 0.01). No effect of atorvastatin on hepatic fatty acid synthesis was observed. These results indicate that the activation of hepatic beta-oxidation by atorvastatin may contribute to the decrease in hepatic triglyceride concentration, leading to its hypotriglyceridemic effect.", 
    "109": "Fatty acids such as palmitate have been observed to induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes but the mechanism of this cytotoxicity is unresolved. The present study sought to determine whether an aspect of fatty acid metabolism is responsible for palmitate-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. As palmitate metabolism increases acetyl CoA production via increased beta oxidation within the mitochondria, we hypothesized that increased acetyl CoA entering the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway might produce intermediates or end products that would be toxic to the cell. To test this hypothesis, cardiomyocytes from embryonic chick cardiomyocytes were treated with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin that inhibits the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway downstream of the acetyl CoA trimerization into HMG-CoA. Lovastatin did not inhibit palmitate-induced apoptosis. Rather, lovastatin induced significant apoptosis itself and when combined with palmitate, the level of apoptosis was equal to the sum of palmitate alone and lovastatin alone. This observation suggests that palmitate and lovastatin are inducing apoptosis by two independent mechanisms. A role for mitochondrial metabolism via carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) in palmitate-induced apoptosis was suggested since capric acid, a fatty acid that is metabolized within the mitochondria but does not utilize CPT-1, did not induce apoptosis. Palmitate-induced apoptosis was further related to the metabolism of saturated fatty acids as the unsaturated fatty acid oleic acid did not induce apoptosis. These data suggest that a unique feature about palmitate metabolism independent of its role in cholesterol biosynthesis is responsible for palmitate-induced apoptosis and the effects of palmitate are additive to those of lovastatin to induce cardiac apoptosis.", 
    "110": "Rho GTPases are signaling molecules known to control cell motility. Several recent studies have suggested a role for Rho proteins in mediating tumor metastasis independent of their affects on cell proliferation. As Rho proteins require post-translational modification with a geranlygeranyl moiety for full activity, we tested the affect of blocking geranylation on localization, downstream signaling, and stimulation of invasion. Expression of a constitutively active Rho construct in A375 melanoma cells dramatically stimulated invasion through Matrigel membranes; however, a constitutively active RhoA mutated so that it cannot be geranylated, failed to stimulate invasion. Moreover, expression of epitope or GFP tagged modifications of this nongeranylatable constitutively active Rho demonstrated that geranylation is necessary for correct cellular localization of Rho. Geranylation was also found to be necessary for full downstream activation of serum response factor mediated transcription. Pharmacologic inhibition of Rho geranylation produced similar inhibition of Rho localization, signaling, and invasion. Our results suggest that inhibition of Rho geranylation may be an attractive pharmacologic target for inhibiting melanoma metastasis.",

    "115": "About 15% of the adult Kuwaiti population has type 2 diabetes and over 50% are hyperlipidaemic by current diagnostic criteria. Not surprisingly, coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in Kuwait. Reports from coronary care units in Kuwait suggest that 40-80% of the CHD patients were diabetic and 50-80% hyperlipidaemic. The pattern worldwide is similar. International guidelines have therefore consistently recognised diabetes as a major risk factor for CHD. In our Lipid Clinic population in Kuwait, about 30% are diabetic. The commonest lipid abnormalities seen in Kuwaiti diabetic patients, as elsewhere, are hypertriglyceridaemia with low HDL levels and variable LDL levels. About 75% of the subjects had either mixed hyperlipidaemia or predominant hypertriglyceridaemia. There are possibly some compositional changes in LDL in the diabetic subjects in that there were important differences in the statistical relationships between LDL and HDL and their respective apolipoproteins - apo B and apo A-1 in diabetic as compared to non-diabetic subjects. Other important observations made in diabetic subjects in Kuwait are: (i) similar serum Lp (a) levels and pattern of apo(a) polymorphism with non-diabetic subjects, with no demonstrable relationship between serum levels of Lp(a) and insulin/insulin sensitivity, although with CHD, Lp(a) levels were increased; (ii) diabetic hyperlipidaemic subjects had elevated PAI-1 levels with significant correlations between blood PAI-1 and insulin levels suggesting underlying insulin resistance (syndrome X). Various landmark trials of cholesterol-lowering therapies in the prevention of CHD have consistently demonstrated near-normalization of the increased CHD risk in diabetes. Our experience in Kuwait suggests that diabetic patients and others with mixed hyperlipidaemia benefit from tight glycaemic control, appropriate advice on diet and exercise with regular reinforcement by continuing contact with professional dietitians and regular availability of drugs where prescribed. Often, it is the regular compliance with medication that is important, rather than the specific medication used particularly where HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statin drugs) are not always available. A useful guideline for management of dyslipidaemia in diabetes is suggested.",

Three primary prevention trials, using clofibrate, cholestyramine and gemfibrozil, had achieved modest reductions in fatal and nonfatal coronary events but none was able to extend life overall or even to reduce cardiovascular mortality; and combined analyses of the three raised disquiet over potential links between cholesterol reduction, cancer and aggressive or violent behaviour. The time was therefore ripe to determine whether statins could help prevent that first and all important myocardial infarction.",

Subjects who had undergone coronary revascularisation or had been hospitalised for angina pectoris in the previous 12 months were excluded, as were those with significant electrocardiographic abnormalities. Participants were randomised to receive pravastatin 40 mg/day or matching placebo and were followed for an average of 4.9 years.",

    "120": "The current therapy for chronic proteinuric nephropathies is angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), which slow, but may not halt, the progression of disease, and which may be not effective to the same degree in all patients. In accelerated passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), this study assessed the effect of combining ACEi with angiotensin II receptor antagonist (AIIRA) and with statin that, besides lowering cholesterol, influences inflammatory and fibrogenic processes. Uninephrectomized PHN rats were divided into four groups (n = 10 each) and daily given oral doses of the following: vehicle; 40 mg/L lisinopril; 100 mg/L lisinopril plus L-158,809; 0.3 mg/kg lisinopril plus L-158,809 plus cerivastatin. Treatments started at 2 mo when rats had massive proteinuria and signs of renal injury and lasted until 10 mo. Increases in BP were equally lowered by treatments. ACEi kept proteinuria at levels comparable to pretreatment and numerically lower than vehicle. The addition of AIIRA to lisinopril was more effective, being proteinuria reduced below pretreatment values and significantly lower than vehicle. When cerivastatin was added on top of ACE inhibition and AIIR blockade, urinary protein regressed to normal values and renal failure was prevented. Renal ACE activity was increased threefold in PHN, it was inhibited by more than 60% after ACEi, and decreased below control values with triple therapy. Cerivastatin inhibited ACE activity by 30%. Glomerulosclerosis, tubular damage and interstitial inflammation were ameliorated by ACEi alone or combined with AIIRA, and prevented by addition of statin. TGF-beta(1) mRNA upregulation in PHN kidney was partially reduced after ACEi or combined with AIIRA and almost normalized after adding statin. Cerivastatin inhibited TGF-beta(1) gene upregulation by 25%. These data suggest a possible future strategy to induce remission of proteinuria, lessen renal injury, and protect from loss of function in those patients who do not fully respond to ACEi therapy.", 
    "121": "Pitavastatin (CAS 147526-32-7, NK-104) is a new and very potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and has been approved for treatment of hyperlipoproteinaemia. Pitavastatin has been studied for its effects on hepatic microsomal drug metabolism in rats, and the activities of several drug-metabolizing enzymes have been measured. No induction of the drug metabolizing enzymes (aniline hydroxylase, aminopyrine N-demethylase, 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase and UDP-glucuronic acid transferase) was found in the pitavastatin group compared to the control after the multiple administrations of pitavastatin at the dosage of 1-10 mg/kg per day for 7 days. Based on several different in vitro approaches, it is concluded that CYP2C9 is the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of pitavastatin and no metabolite is present in renal and intestinal microsomes. The CYP2C9 polymorphism was not involved in the pitavastatin metabolism. No inhibitory effect in CYP-mediated metabolism was detected on the tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C9) and testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4) in the presence of pitavastatin. The results suggested that pitavastatin did not affect the drug-metabolizing systems.", 
    "122": "Inflammatory mechanisms are central in human atherosclerosis. Although C-reactive protein (CRP) as a serum marker is highly predictive for cardiovascular events, the intimal expression of CRP in clinically relevant coronary lesions is unknown, in particular in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Shown by reduced CRP serum values, statins have antiinflammatory and plaque-stabilizing effects. In the present study, the presence of CRP in coronary atheromas with ACS versus stable angina (SA) as well as its possible modification by chronic statin medication was assessed. Coronary atherectomy probes from 90 primary stenoses were immunohistochemically analyzed with regard to the presence and the localization of CRP. Intimal results of patients with ACS (n=36), categorized according to the Braunwald classification, were compared with those of patients with SA (n=54). In 40 of 90 lesions (44%), immunoreaction specific for CRP was observed demonstrating a mean CRP expression of 1.7%. CRP was focally localized in a maximum of 69% of all plaque cells, the most in macrophages/foam cells, infrequently in smooth muscle cells. CRP-positive plaques showed more thrombus than plaques without CRP (63% vs 41%). Intact non-atherosclerotic control tissue revealed no signaling. As a central finding, intimal presence and expression were higher (each p<0.001) with ACS (69% and 3.1%, respectively) compared to SA (28% and 0.8%, respective). Subgroup analysis of target lesions associated with ACS according to the clinical Braunwald classification showed an increase of intimal CRP with classes I-III. In the presence of statin medication, intimal CRP was significantly lower than that without statin therapy (29 and 1.3%, vs 61 and 2.6%, respectively; p<0.01), in particular in the subgroup of ACS patients. Intimal CRP is frequently found in coronary primary stenoses, very often with macrophages/foam cells, and shows a highly significant prevalence with ACS. In this subgroup of patients, statin therapy is associated with significantly reduced intimal CRP. Our in situ findings as shown might explain the well-known serum constellations with statin therapy.",

The Heart Protection Study also demonstrated that the benefits of LDL cholesterol reduction extend into peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease prevention and suggest that the most recent National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, with LDL cholesterol targets of 2.6 mmol/l, may result in undertreatment of a large number of patients. Various large end-point trials, including Treating to New Targets and Study of Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine will attempt to further address the issue of optimal LDL cholesterol reduction. New therapies are being developed to meet the challenge of more intensive cholesterol lowering. Rosuvastatin is a potent, hydrophilic enantiomeric statin producing reductions in LDL cholesterol of 40-69% over its dose range of 5-80 mg. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, with a site of action at the intestinal epithelium. Optimum reductions in LDL cholesterol of up to 25 and 60% reduction in chylomicron cholesterol content are seen with a 10-mg dose.",

    "127": "Population-based observational cohort studies show a variable weak positive relationship between increasing plasma total cholesterol concentrations and an increasing risk of ischaemic stroke, which is partly offset by a weaker negative association between decreasing total cholesterol concentrations and an increasing risk of with haemorrhagic stroke. However, randomized controlled trials show unequivocally that lowering plasma total cholesterol by approximately 1.2 mmol/l (and LDL-cholesterol by 1.0 mmol/l) is associated with a reduced relative risk of stroke and other serious vascular events by at least a quarter, and probably a third, without any increase in haemorrhagic stroke, in a wide range of men and women (including individuals with previous stroke). The proportional reduction in stroke risk is consistent, irrespective of the patient's age, baseline plasma cholesterol concentration, and absolute risk of stroke (although perhaps less in very low-risk individuals), but is increased with greater degrees of cholesterol lowering (15% or more), and thus with statin medications, which are more potent than non-statin interventions in lowering cholesterol levels. The absolute reduction in stroke risk achieved by statins is greatest among individuals at highest risk of stroke. Preliminary evidence suggests that lowering total cholesterol levels by diet may be an effective adjunctive therapy to statins, and raising plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations among patients with coronary heart disease and low HDL-cholesterol levels ( 1 mmol/l) by means of gemfibrozil may also effectively prevent stroke.", 
    "128": "Statin drugs are effective and safe in preventing initial and recurrent stroke. However, because they are costly, they should probably be restricted to individuals with an annual risk of stroke and other serious vascular events of 3% or greater, and possibly as low as 1.5%, because routine monitoring of plasma cholesterol, and liver and muscle enzyme concentrations is probably no longer necessary.",

Afterwards, the role of statins and their interactions with other drugs in precipitating this condition have been carefully reviewed. In approximately 60% of the total number of cases, statin-related rhabdomyolysis was found to be related to drug/drug interactions. Recently, all cases of fatal rhabdomyolysis associated with statin use have been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration. This has shown that fatal rhabdomyolysis among statin users is a rare event, the reporting rates being much less than one death per million prescriptions in the case of all statins except cerivastatin.", 
    "131": "The safety and tolerability of the available statins support their use as the first-line treatment of patients at high risk for coronary heart disease, since the clinical benefits greatly outweigh the small risk of myopathy.

Ezetimibe selectively inhibits the uptake of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen at the level of the enterocyte in the intestinal brush border while having no effect on other sterols or lipid-soluble vitamins. Ezetimibe 10 mg daily produces a consistent reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by approximately 15 to 20% when used as monotherapy or in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors (statins) or fenofibrate and a 4 to 9% increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Unlike other lipid-lowering medications that act in the gastrointestinal tract, ezetimibe does not appear to worsen hypertriglyceridemia. Ezetimibe also has an adverse-event profile that is similar to placebo when used as monotherapy or in combination with statins and fenofibrate. Studies of longer duration and with niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and gemfibrozil are warranted to more completely assess the safety of ezetimibe in combination therapy. To date, no clinically significant drug-drug interactions have been noted with the use of ezetimibe; however, further studies are warranted. Ezetimibe will be useful as monotherapy in patients who need modest reductions in LDL-C or are intolerant to other lipid-lowering medication, and in combination with a statin in patients who are unable to tolerate large doses of statins or need further reductions in LDL-C despite maximum doses of a statin.

Duration of the study was 5 years. All-cause mortality was significantly reduced among patients allocated to simvastatin (-12.3%) due to a highly significant (-18%) reduction in the coronary death rate, a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths. There were highly significant reductions (of about one-quarter) in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction and coronary death (combined), for non-fatal and fatal stroke and for coronary or non-coronary revascularization. The beneficial effect of simvastatin was seen in all sub-categories which were studied and, particularly: women vs men; patients aged > 70 years vs those aged < 70 years; patients with LDL cholesterol < vs > 116 mg/dl, or total cholesterol < vs > 193 mg/dl.

All comparisons between antioxidant vitamin supplementation and placebo failed to reveal any difference in favour or against the supplementation which was otherwise well tolerated. These important results and their implications will be briefly discussed.", 
    "147": "Aging (O) rats have a greater susceptibility to renal ischemia than young (Y) rats due to an endothelial dysfunction partially reversed by exogenous administration of L-Arginine. Since statins are able to increase nitric oxide (NO) production, aim of the study was to evaluate whether pre-treatment with atorvastatin (ATO, 10 mg/kg/day for 12 days), had positive effects on ischemic acute renal failure (ARF) of aging rats.", 
    "148": "Renal clearance studies (inulin) were performed 24 hours after ischemia in 6 Groups (n=6 in each Group) of both Y- and O-rats: control rats (CON), untreated rats with ARF (Groups IRA), and rats with ARF but pretreated with ATO (Groups ATO+IRA).", 
    "149": "Renal ischemia determined a sharper decrease in GFR of Group O-IRA than Y-IRA (-80% and -63% vs respective CON, both p<0.001). In both Groups the fall in GFR was secondary to renal vasoconstriction and the consequent reduction in renal plasma flow. Pre-treatment with ATO did not modify GFR in Group Y-ATO+IRA, but was able to determine a marked rise in GFR of rats of O-ATO+IRA Group (+100% vs O-IRA), through a reduction in renal vascular resistances. Induction of ARF greatly enhanced nitrate excretion in Group Y-IRA, but slightly affected Group O-ARF. Administration of ATO did not modify nitrite excretion in Y rats, whereas it was able to increase nitrate excretion in O-ATO+ARF rats (+111% vs O-IRA).", 
    "150": "Pre-treatment with ATO is able to improve the renal response to ischemia in aging rats, through a mechanism which likely is NO-dependent.", 
    "151": "We aimed to assess whether the effectiveness of statins in the prevention of myocardial infarction, stroke and total mortality is influenced by apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype in an elderly population. We used data from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study in the Netherlands which started in 1990 and included 7983 subjects aged 55 years and older. Subjects who were treated with cholesterol lowering drugs at baseline or with a serum total cholesterol > or = 6.5 mmol/l at baseline were included. We compared the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke and total mortality in subjects who received > or = 2 years of statin treatment with that in subjects who had been treated for less than 2 years, and in untreated subjects, using a Cox proportional hazard model with cumulative statin use defined as time-dependent covariates. The adjusted relative risk of all-cause mortality was 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-1.22] and of myocardial infarction and stroke 0.50 (95% CI 0.28-0.91) for subjects treated with statins for > or = 2 years compared to untreated subjects. The adjusted relative risks for subjects with the epsilon4 allele were 0.91 (95% CI 0.45-1.84) for all-cause mortality and 0.63 (95% CI 0.23-1.78) for myocardial infarction and stroke. In subjects without the epsilon4 allele, adjusted relative risks were 0.71 (95% CI 0.41-1.24) for all-cause mortality and 0.46 (95% CI 0.22-0.95) for myocardial infarction and stroke. We found a protective effect of statins on the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke that was independent of apoE genotype. The protective effect of statins on total mortality was not statistically significant, but did not seem to differ between subjects with different apoE genotypes.", 
    "152": "Rhabdomyolysis is a known complication of hepatic 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) inhibitor (statin) therapy for posttransplant hyperlipidemia, and thus monitoring for this effect is indicated. We report a case of an herbal preparation-induced rhabdomyolysis in a stable renal-transplant recipient, attributed to the presence of red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) within the mixture. The condition resolved when consumption of the product ceased. Rice fermented with red yeast contains several types of mevinic acids, including monacolin K, which is identical to lovastatin. We postulate that the interaction of cyclosporine and these compounds through the cytochrome P450 system resulted in the adverse effect seen in this patient. Transplant recipients must be cautioned against using herbal preparations to lower their lipid levels to prevent such complications from occurring.", 
    "153": "Pancreatic islets are susceptible to myriad insults that occur during islet isolation and transplantation. Studies demonstrated the role of Akt in regulating pancreatic beta-cell growth and survival. Activation of Akt maintains Bad phosphorylation and prevents its binding to mitochondrial targets, decreases caspase-9 activity, and prevents the translocation of forkhead transcription factors (FKHR). Simvastatin activates Akt in mammalian cells; therefore, we investigated the role of simvastatin on human pancreatic islets (HPI) survival.", 
    "154": "HPI were treated with simvastatin, with and without LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. PI viability was examined with ethidium bromide-acridine orange, and apoptosis was examined using a quantitative assay. Akt, Bad, FKHR phosphorylation, and mitochondrial cytochrome release were analyzed by Western blots. Caspase-9 activity was assessed by a fluorometric assay. A limited number of HPI were transplanted after simvastatin treatment in diabetic NOD-SCID mice.", 
    "155": "Low levels of Akt phosphorylation (activation) were demonstrated early after islet isolation. Akt activation; increase in islet viability; and decrease in Bad phosphorylation, cytochrome release, caspase-9 activation, and translocation of FKHR were observed after simvastatin treatment, effects reversed by LY294002. Among recipients of islets without simvastatin, none demonstrated reversal of diabetes after the transplant. In contrast, 58% of the recipients given islets treated with simvastatin remained euglycemic 30 days after the transplant.", 
    "156": "Targeting the survival pathway with simvastatin exerts a cytoprotective effect on isolated PI. Activation of the Akt pathway is a potential new therapeutic approach to reduce loss of functional islet mass to bolster success in clinical islet transplantation.", 
    "157": "Dyslipidaemia may be a risk factor for venous thromboembolism and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may be protective. The current review outlines the cumulative evidence from both the basic and epidemiologic sciences for why this might be so and offers some directions for future research.", 
    "158": "Fluvastatin was the first wholly synthetic statin to the market and is effective in reducing total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, which translates into reductions in coronary heart disease events. The Lescol Intervention Prevention Study has established the effectiveness of the early use of statins in reducing recurrent events in high-risk patients with coronary heart disease post percutaneous coronary interventions. Fluvastatin is well-tolerated with few side effects. The occurrence of significant abnormalities in liver enzymes is infrequent, and the risk of myositis and rhabdomyolysis seems to be less than with other statins. There have been no reports of fatal rhabdomyolysis to date. The potential for drug interactions with fluvastatin is low. It seems safe in combination with cyclosporin and there have been few reports of rhabdomyolysis when using fluvastatin in combination with other lipid-lowering agents. It is nevertheless important to be vigilant for this potentially important side effect and, as with other statins, inform patients of the potential risk and suggestive symptoms. Fluvastatin provides a useful option in treating hypercholesterolaemia in patients at high risk of coronary heart disease.", 
    "159": "Most experts agree that prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) should be enforced. However doubt remains about how extensively pharmacological treatment should be applied. In the presence of strong financial constraints both issues emphasize the importance of health economic analyses in this area. This article describes important principles in health economics. As the effect of preventive measures can only be recognized after a considerable time lag, a long-term perspective has to be chosen. A suitable parameter are the costs per life year saved, which can be compared between otherwise completely different procedures. The assessment of different therapies depends strongly on parameters such as relative risk reduction, discount rate and costs for prevention. However it was shown that prevention with statins and anti-hypertensive therapy can be cost-effective, as the mortality reduction and hence the increase in life expectancy can be considerable. Further research is necessary, e.g., to investigate possible reductions of other vascular diseases, to acquire more knowledge about long-term cost-consequences.", 
    "160": "Stroke is the second most common cause of death and dementia and the number one cause of serious disability in adults in developed countries. After the stroke there remains a maximum vascular risk of recurrence (stroke, heart attack or vascular death). The known vascular risk factors (RF) could only explain 50% of vascular events. A better knowledge of atherogenesis, of the mechanisms that cause instability in the atheroma plaque and of new vascular RF gives rise to new preventive therapeutic approaches. This knowledge is the result of new clinical trials, such as the use of ACE inhibitors, statins, vitamins related with homocysteine, and the use of antihypertensive drugs to prevent cognitive deterioration or dementia, which add to those that have already been conducted.", 
    "161": "Sterol regulatory elements binding factor-1a (SREBF-1a) and SREBF cleavage activating protein (SCAP) regulate lipids homeostasis. Polymorphisms in SREBF-1a and SCAP could affect plasma levels of lipids and risk of atherosclerosis. We determined association of SREBF-1a -36del/G and SCAP 2386A/G genotypes with plasma levels of lipids, severity and progression/regression of coronary atherosclerosis, and response to treatment with fluvastatin in a well-characterized Lipoprotein Coronary Atherosclerosis Study population. Plasma lipids and quantitative indices of coronary atherosclerosis were obtained at baseline and 2.5 years following randomization to fluvastatin or placebo in 372 subjects. Fluvastatin reduced plasma levels of total cholesterol by 16%, LDL-C by 25%, and ApoB by 16% and increased plasma levels of HDL-C by 9% and apoA-1 by 7%. Distributions of SREBF-1a SCAP genotypes were 60 GG, 172 del-G and 140 del-del and 88 GG, 188 GA and 96 AA, respectively. There were no significant differences in baseline plasma levels of lipids or indices of severity of atherosclerosis among the genotypes of each gene. There was a strong graded genotype-treatment interaction between SREBF-1a genotypes and change in apoA-I levels in response to fluvastatin (16.5% increase in GG, 10.5% in del/G, and 0.4% in del/del groups). Modest interactions between SREBF-1a genotypes and changes in HDL-C, and apoC-III levels in response to fluvastatin were also present. No genotype-treatment interaction for progression or regression of coronary atherosclerosis was detected. There were no significant interactions between SCAP genotypes and response to therapy. Thus we detected a strong graded interaction between SREBF-1a -36del/G genotypes and response of plasma apoA-I to treatment with fluvastatin.", 
    "162": "The mlcR gene encodes a putative 50.2-kDa protein with a Zn(II)(2)Cys(6) DNA-binding domain, which may be involved in the regulation of ML-236B biosynthesis in Penicillium citrinum. The induction of ML-236B production appears to correlate with the expression of mlcR, and the ML-236B biosynthetic genes mlcA- mlcH, and occurs mostly during the stationary phase. The present study was designed to examine the effects of alterations in mlcR expression on ML-236B biosynthesis. We first set out to increase the mlcR copy number in the chromosome of P. citrinum. Transformants with additional copies of native mlcR showed increased transcription of mlcR and produced larger amounts of ML-236B than the parent strain. Altered mlcR expression was also achieved by introducing a construct, designated pgkA(P)::mlcR, that contained the mlcR coding region fused to the (constitutively active) promoter and terminator sequences of the Aspergillus nidulans 3-phospho-glycerate kinase (pgkA) gene. Transformants carrying the pgkA(P)::mlcR construct expressed mlcR constitutively, and produced ML-236B during the exponential growth phase, suggesting that the pgkA(P)::mlcR construct does affect the regulation of ML-236B biosynthesis. Comparative expression analysis by RT-PCR showed that altering the expression profile of mlcR influenced the expression of some of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes. The evidence suggests that mlcR may indeed be involved in the transcriptional activation of some of the pathway-specific genes required for ML-236B biosynthesis.", 
    "163": "Cerivastatin is one of the synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors used for the treatment and prevention of hypercholesterolaemia. The observation that patients receiving this drug had a lower incidence at cancer led to our interest in using it as a putative anticancer agent. In this study, we tested the cytotoxicity of cerivastatin on a panel of 5-fluorouracil (5FU) sensitive and resistant cell lines in vitro. Cerivastatin was cytotoxic to both 5FU sensitive and resistant cells. Cerivastatin significantly augmented the cytotoxic effect of 5FU on drug sensitive (6-22-fold) and resistant (229-310-fold) cell lines. Cerivastatin and 5FU acted synergistically. Cerivastatin inhibited nuclear factor kappaB DNA binding activity. The enhancing effect of cerivastatin on 5FU was partially mevalonate pathway independent. Cerivastatin may allow successful 5FU therapy in chemoresistant patients.", 
    "164": "To clarify the uptake mechanism(s) for statins, we examined whether monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) contributed to the uptake of lovastatin acid by rat cultured mesangial cells. Expression of mRNAs for MCT1, 2, and 4 was confirmed in mesangial cells. The uptake of lovastatin acid by mesangial cells increased with decreasing extracellular pH. There was clear overshooting in lovastatin acid uptake by the ATP-depleted cells in the presence, but not in the absence, of an inwardly directed H(+)-gradient. The representative MCT substrates/inhibitors inhibited the lovastatin acid uptake. In particular, the inhibition of lovastatin acid uptake by L-lactic acid at the concentration of 80 mM reached 70%, and L-lactic acid and valproic acid inhibited the uptake competitively. On preloading of mesangial cells with L-lactic acid or valproic acid, the lovastatin acid uptake was significantly stimulated. The inhibition constant of L-lactic acid for the lovastatin acid uptake was 32 mM, and this value is comparable to the Michaelis constant (>20 mM) of L-lactic acid for MCT4 described elsewhere. These results demonstrate that lovastatin acid was largely taken up by mesangial cells via MCT, and suggest that MCT4 might contribute to lovastatin acid uptake in the cells.", 
    "165": "The effects of treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibitors lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin on the contents of cytochrome p450 mRNAs were examined in primary cultures of human hepatocytes prepared from three different livers. Treatment of 2- to 3-day-old human hepatocyte cultures with 3 x 10(-5) M lovastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, or atorvastatin for 24 h increased the amounts of CYP2B6 and CYP3A mRNA by an average of 3.8- to 9.2-fold and 24- to 36-fold, respectively. In contrast, pravastatin treatment had no effect on the mRNA level of either CYP2B6 or CYP3A, although treatment with pravastatin did produce the expected compensatory increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA content, indicating effective inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. Although treatment with the active (+), but not the inactive (-), enantiomer of atorvastatin increased the amount of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, treatment with each enantiomer significantly induced both CYP2B6 and CYP3A mRNA levels. Treatment of primary cultured rat hepatocytes with the atorvastatin enantiomers effectively increased the amount of CYP3A mRNA, but had no effect on CYP2B or CYP4A mRNA levels, in contrast to fluvastatin, which increased both. Findings for p450 proteins by Western blotting were consistent with the mRNA results. These findings indicate that the ability of a drug to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity does not predict its ability to produce p450 induction in primary cultured human hepatocytes, and demonstrate that some, but not all, of the effects of these drugs that occur in primary cultured rat hepatocytes are conserved in human hepatocyte cultures.", 
    "166": "To explore the mechanism of the interaction between gemfibrozil and cerivastatin, the enzyme mapping of the oxidative metabolism of cerivastatin and the effect of gemfibrozil on cerivastatin metabolism were studied using human liver microsomes and expressed cytochrome p450 (p450) CYP2C8 and 3A4 isoforms. Based on studies with isoform-selective chemical inhibitors and expressed enzymes, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 were equally important in the formation of desmethylcerivastatin (M-1), whereas the formation of the quantitatively most important hydroxy metabolite (M-23) was predominantly mediated via CYP2C8; other p450 isoforms played a negligible role. In human liver microsomes, gemfibrozil markedly inhibited M-23 formation, with a K(i) (IC(50)) value of 69 (95) micro M, whereas inhibition of M-1 formation was weaker with a K(i) (IC(50)) value of 273 (>250) micro M. The inhibitory effect of gemfibrozil was attributable to inhibition of CYP2C8 rather than CYP3A4, as evidenced by potent inhibition of the formation of M-23 (IC(50) = 68 micro M) and M-1 (IC(50) = 78 micro M) in recombinant CYP2C8 but not in recombinant CYP3A4. Additionally, gemfibrozil inhibited paclitaxel 6 alpha-hydroxylation [K(i) (IC(50)) = 75 micro M (91 micro M)], a CYP2C8 marker reaction, but did not inhibit testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4). The present in vitro findings suggest that inhibition of CYP2C8 activity by gemfibrozil at least partially explains the interaction between gemfibrozil and cerivastatin. The formation of M-23 acid from cerivastatin is mediated mainly by CYP2C8 and thus may be a suitable CYP2C8 probe reaction. Inhibition of CYP2C8-mediated metabolism by gemfibrozil warrants further in vivo exploration.", 
    "167": "There is a need for anabolic drugs that can stimulate bone growth, improve bone microarchitecture, accelerate fracture healing and thus restore bone strength to oteoporotics. The anabolic agents currently leading the way to the clinic are the parathroid hormone (PTH) and some of its adenylyl cyclase-stimulating fragments. Here we discuss what is known about the genes and their products that are stimulated by PTHR1 receptor signals and in four ways cause a large accumulation of bone-building osteoblasts. We will also discuss the currently controversial anabolic activity of the cholesterol-lowering statins and outline a possible mechanism by which they might stimulate BMP-2 expession and bone growth. Finally, we will present the growing evidence for the body's \"fat-o-stat\" cytokine-leptin-indirectly restraining bone growth via a hypothalamic factor and at the same serving as a local autocrine/paracrine stimulator of osteoblast activity via IGF-I and an inhibitor of osteoclast generation by stimulating osteoblastic cells' antiosteoclast OPG (osteoprotegerin) expression and reducing their proosteoclast RANKL expression.",

There were no significant changes in HDL or VLDL compared with baseline. There were also no differences in alanine transaminase pre- vs post-atorvastatin therapy. Complications included muscle pain (n = 2) and asymptomatic elevations in creatine kinase (n = 2). Two of these 4 patients developed rhabdomyolysis. Excluding these 4 patients, creatine kinase did not rise compared with baseline. No patient developed alterations in renal function.",

All 26 adult patients on chronic HD at a tertiary care medical facility were entered into the program. A clinical pharmacist was responsible for laboratory monitoring, patient counseling, and the initiation and dosage adjustment of an appropriate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) using a dosing algorithm and monitoring guidelines. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal was leq; 100 mg/dl. A renal dietitian provided nutrition counseling and the nephrologist was notified of potential or existing drug interactions or adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Patients received a flyer containing lipid panel results to encourage compliance. Data was collected at program initiation and for 6 months thereafter.",

Mean LDL cholesterol decreased from 96 +/- 5 to 80 +/- 3 mg/dl (p < 0.01), and mean total cholesterol decreased from 170 +/- 7 to 151 +/- 4 mg/dl (p < 0.01). Fifteen adjustments in drug therapy were made. Eight adverse drug reactions were identified; 2 required drug discontinuation or an alternative agent. Physicians were alerted to 8 potential drug-drug interactions, and appropriate monitoring was performed.",
