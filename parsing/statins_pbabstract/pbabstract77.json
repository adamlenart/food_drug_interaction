Based on coronary calcification (CAC) scores FDRs were divided in a group of healthy subjects (CAC\u200a=\u200a0) and subjects with subclinical atherosclerosis (CAC>0). We did not observe differences in the number of BOEC colonies and proliferation between premature CAD patients and FDRs. FDRs with subclinical atherosclerosis had lower colony numbers compared with healthy FDRs, however this was not statistically significant, and BOEC proliferation was significantly impaired (OR\u200a=\u200a0.45, 95% CI 0.21-0.96). Unexpectedly, the number of BOEC colonies and BOEC proliferation were similar for premature CAD patients and healthy FDRs. Since a considerable number of premature CAD patients used statins, we studied the number of BOEC precursors as well as their proliferative capacity in ten individuals with subclinical atherosclerosis, before and after statin therapy. Interestingly, FDRs with subclinical atherosclerosis showed a significant increase in the number of BOEC colonies after statin therapy.",

Primary end points were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for worsening HF, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Risk ratios (RRs) and Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were calculated using fixed-effects models or random-effects models.", 
    "9": "A total of 13 randomised trials with 1,532 subjects were included in this analysis. Ten trials randomised patients to atorvastatin, two to simvastatin, and one to pitavastatin.

Subgroup analyses showed that the effects of lipophilic statins in HF were not modified by age, baseline LVEF, and cause of HF. In addition, patients randomised to lipophilic statins had a significant increase in LVEF (WMD 3.91%, P<0.001) and decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD 0.90 mmol/L, P<0.001).",

    "11": "Statins have, at present, the potential to provide a new therapeutic target for various neurological diseases. It is well established that statins reduce cholesterol levels and prevent coronary heart disease. Moreover, evidence suggest that statins have additional properties such as endothelial protection via action on the nitric oxide synthase system as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet effects. These properties might have potential therapeutic implication not only in stroke but also in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and primary brain tumors. In addition to their potent anti-atherosclerotic and cardio-protective effects, compelling clinical and preclinical studies delineate the neuro-protective efficacy of statins in all these neurological disorders. It is apparent from these studies that most patients with central nervous system disorders probably benefit to some extent from lipid-lowering therapy. But data are not univocal, and we must also consider the adverse effects due to the administration of lipid-lowering therapy. Thus, in these scenarios the effectiveness of statins in treating stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, and primary brain tumors have to be conclusively proven in vivo and/or in adequate clinical trials.", 
    "12": "Lovastatin was identified through virtual screening as a potential inhibitor of the LEDGF/p75-HIV-1 integrase interaction. In an AlphaScreen assay, lovastatin inhibited the purified recombinant protein-protein interaction (IC50 = 1.97 \u00b1 0.45 \u03bcm) more effectively than seven other tested statins. None of the eight statins, however, yielded antiviral activity in vitro, while only pravastatin lactone yielded detectable inhibition of HIV-1 integrase strand transfer activity (31.65% at 100 \u03bcm). A correlation between lipophilicity and increased cellular toxicity of the statins was observed.", 
    "13": "This paper draws on a study of over-the-counter statins to provide a critical account of the figure of the 'pharmaceutical consumer' as a key actor in the pharmaceuticalisation literature. A low dose statin, promising to reduce cardiovascular risk, was reclassified to allow sale in pharmacies in the UK in 2004. We analysed professional and policy debates about the new product, promotional and sales information, and interviews with consumers and potential consumers conducted between 2008 and 2011, to consider the different consumer identities invoked by these diverse actors. While policymakers constructed an image of 'the citizen-consumer' who would take responsibility for heart health through exercising the choice to purchase a drug that was effectively rationed on the NHS and medical professionals raised concerns about 'a flawed consumer' who was likely to misuse the product, both these groups assumed that there would be a market for the drug. By contrast, those who bought the product or potentially fell within its target market might appear as 'health consumers', seeking out and paying for different food and lifestyle products and services, including those targeting high cholesterol. However, they were reluctant 'pharmaceutical consumers' who either preferred to take medication on the advice of a doctor, or sought to minimize medicine use. In comparison to previous studies, our analysis builds understanding of individual consumers in a market, rather than collective action for access to drugs (or, less commonly, compensation for adverse effects). Where some theories of pharmaceuticalisation have presented consumers as creating pressure for expanding markets, our data suggests that sociologists should be cautious about assuming there will be demand for new pharmaceutical products, especially those aimed at prevention or asymptomatic conditions, even in burgeoning health markets.",

We used data were from 2004 to 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and identified from self-reported diabetes or insulin use. We categorized antidepressants and statins use into four groups: antidepressants only, statins only, combined use of antidepressants and statins (antidepressants-statins), and neither antidepressant nor statins. We conducted chi-square and multivariable logistic regressions to examine the association between use of antidepressants-statins and new-onset diabetes after controlling for demographic and economic characteristics, health-status, access to care, presence of depression, and lifestyle risk factors.", 
    "16": "In our study sample, 9.3% used antidepressants only, 10.7% used statins only and 2.4% adults reported use of antidepressants-statins. Nearly 2% of the study sample reported new-onset diabetes. In unadjusted analyses, significantly higher proportion of adults using antidepressants-statins (3.2%) reported new-onset diabetes compared to those using neither antidepressants nor statins (1.1%). However, after controlling for all other variables in multivariable regression we did not observe a statistically significant association between use of antidepressants-statins and new-onset diabetes.", 
    "17": "Our study results do not suggest that use of antidepressants-statins may increase the risk of new-onset diabetes. Future research needs to examine this relationship with specific combinations of these drug classes and using longer follow up periods.", 
    "18": "Statins effectively reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. However, even after low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment there is a residual CVD risk. To reduce this risk, combining statins with drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was investigated. The GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation (GREACE), Japanese Coronary Artery Disease (JCAD), Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) and The Assessing the Treatment Effect in Metabolic Syndrome Without Perceptible Diabetes (ATTEMPT) trials suggest that the statin plus RAS inhibition combination reduces CVD events more than a statin alone and considerably more than RAS inhibition alone. This benefit seems to be related to effects on endothelial function, vascular inflammation and the initiation, progression and rupture of atheromatous plaques. These effects are, at least in part, driven by mediators, the microRNAs (miRs), that are implicated in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis (e.g. restoration of endothelial function and attenuation of vascular inflammation). Some miRs are favourably affected by statins and others by RAS inhibition. There is a miR family (miR-146a/b), related to coronary artery plaque destabilization that is beneficially affected by both statins and RAS inhibition. Statins and RAS inhibition combination should be routinely prescribed in high risk patients with CVD, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and/or diabetes to maximize clinical benefit.", 
    "19": "Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are considered as important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), while highdensity lipoproteins (HDL) are well recognized for their putative role in reverse cholesterol transport and other atheroprotective functions. Both LDL and HDL are heterogeneous in nature, including various subfractions depending on the method of isolation (\u2265 7 LDL and 10 HDL subspecies, respectively). While it is established that small, dense LDL (sdLDL) have atherogenic potential, the role of different HDL subfractions is still largely unclear. The majority of clinical studies suggest an atheroprotective role of larger HDL particles, although recent work has highlighted the role of dysfunctional HDL within different subfractions. Several therapeutic approaches are able to primarily target cholesterol concentration in LDL or HDL. Certain drugs, such as niacin, statins and fibrates target multiple lipid traits (i.e. pleiotropic drug effects), while cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors are able to increase plasma HDL cholesterol levels. Statins represent the most used lipid-lowering drugs, but there is a continued interest in the development of novel therapeutic approaches, including those that might affect dysfunctional HDL. Targeting distinct LDL and HDL subfractions may potentially reduce the residual risk seen in clinical endpoint trials.", 
    "20": "Statins remain the cornerstone of hypolipidaemic drug treatment. The recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) lipid guidelines suggest using percent reductions of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), according to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, rather than specific LDL-C targets. These guidelines raised concerns and other Societies (US, International, European) have not endorsed them. The implementation of previous guidelines in clinical practice is suboptimal due to attitudes of physicians and restrictions in health care systems. Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which degrades the LDL receptor, like alirocumab and evolocumab, are in phase 3 trials. These drugs are suitable for statin intolerant or resistant patients, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HeFH) and some forms of homozygous FH (HoFH). Mipomersen (antisense oligonucleotide against apolipoprotein B) and lomitapide (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein blocker) have already been approved for HoFH. Eventually, silencing micro-RNA oligonucleotides may also become available. The repair or silencing of genes implicated in hyperlipidaemia and/or atherosclerosis is also on the horizon. If the new therapeutic options mentioned above prove to be effective and safe then by combining them with statins and/or ezetimibe we should be able to effectively control acquired or hereditary dyslipidaemias and substantially further reduce CVD morbidity and mortality.", 
    "21": "Aging is associated with arterial stiffening and subsequent acceleration of pulse wave movement. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia are associated with increased arterial stiffness, a 'premature' arterial aging. Antihypertensive drugs exhibit beneficial effects on arterial stiffness, both at the central and peripheral level, and these effects are mainly attributed to blood pressure reduction per se. However, additional benefits of the renin-angiotensin system inhibitors have been recently suggested. Furthermore, a disparity in the effects of beta-blockers on arterial stiffness between conventional and vasodilatory agents has also been suggested. Statin treatment is an essential element of cardiovascular therapy and statins are frequently administered by patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease. The effects of statins on arterial stiffness are not yet well established. Moreover, the effects of combining statins with antihypertensive drugs or other strategies to attenuate arterial aging are not adequately studied. The aim of the current review is to present the effects of available therapeutic strategies on arterial stiffness with special emphasis on hypolipidemic and antihypertensive drugs, critically evaluate available information and provide future perspectives in this field.", 
    "22": "Statins are the most powerful lipid lowering drugs in clinical practice. However, the efficacy of statin therapy, as seen in randomized control trials, is undermined by the documented non-adherence observed in clinical practice. Understanding the clinical consequences of statin non-adherence is an important step in implementing successful interventions aimed at improving adherence. Our previous systematic review included a literature search up to January 2010 on the effects of statin non-adherence or discontinuation on cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular outcomes. We provide an update to this publication and a review of promising interventions that have reported a demonstrated improvement in statin adherence. Through a systematic literature search of PubMed, Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science, out of the 3440 initially identified, 13 studies were selected. Non-adherence in a primary prevention population was associated with a graded increase in CV risk. Individuals taking statins for secondary prevention were at particular risk when taking statin with highly variable adherence. Moreover, particular attention is warranted for non-adherence in diabetic and rheumatoid arthritis populations, as non-adherence is significantly associated with CV risk as early as 1 month following discontinuation. Statin adherence, therefore, represents an important modifiable risk factor. Numerous interventions to improve adherence have shown promise, including copayment reduction, automatic reminders, mail-order pharmacies, counseling with a health professional, and fixed-dose combination therapy. Given the complexity of causes underlying statin non-adherence, successful strategies will likely need to be tailored to each patient.", 
    "23": "In addition to the modification of the lipid profile, most lipid-lowering agents appear to modulate other atherogenic pathways. We summarize the effects of lipid-lowering agents on inflammation, hemostasis and blood pressure. We also discuss the potential contribution of these actions on cardiovascular disease prevention. Most lipid-lowering agents appear to exert anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antihypertensive effects. These pleiotropic actions appear to contribute to the reduction in cardiovascular events and deep venous thrombosis during statin treatment. Regarding other lipid-lowering agents, it is unclear whether their effects on inflammation, thrombosis or blood pressure play a role in their antiatherogenic potential.", 
    "24": "In the last decade, an increased number of new cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among patients who use statins have been reported. The aim of the present review is to compile the most relevant information about the risk of T2DM associated with the use and dose of different statins, especially based on meta-analysis considering different studies worldwide. To explain this relationship, several studies have reported the effect of statins on insulin resistance in dyslipidemic non-diabetic patients, reporting different findings according to the types of statins. In addition, some reports -based on culture of \u03b2 pancreatic cells- have evaluated the effect of these drugs in certain cellular events that are essential for insulin secretion. Clearly, further studies in humans are needed -applying more robust tests than those used up to date- in order to define more precisely the potential mechanisms explaining the higher incidence of T2DM among statin users.",

    "26": "This was a subanalysis of the Justification for Atherosclerosis Regression Treatment (JART) Study. We compared the efficacy of intensive lipid-lowering therapy and conventional therapy with respect to changes in the mean intima-media thickness (IMT) and serum lipid levels.

    "27": "Intensive lipid-lowering therapy with rosuvastatin was associated with significantly smaller changes in the mean IMT and a greater reduction in the serum lipid levels in comparison to conventional therapy with pravastatin. The average net change in the mean IMT was 0.010 mm (n=121) at 12 months and -0.004 mm (n=56) at 24 months. A decrease in LDL-C was found to be associated with a smaller change in the mean IMT (p=0.0009; Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test). A greater reduction in serum LDL-C was found to be associated with a smaller change in the mean IMT. Similar associations were observed for the serum TC and non-HDL-C levels and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. There were no notable differences in the incidence of serious adverse events among the LDL-C quartiles.",

We performed a systematic search and review of statin clinical trials to examine how these studies evaluated muscle problems and to determine why there are apparent differences in muscle problems between clinical trials and practice. We initially identified 1,012 reports related to clinical trials of statin therapy, 42 of which qualified for analysis. Fifteen, 4, and 22 trials reported creatine kinase values only >10, 5, and 3 times the upper limits of normal, respectively, in both statin- and placebo-treated participants. Four trials reported average creatine kinase values, which increased with statin treatment in 3 instances. Twenty-six trials reported muscle problems, with an average incidence in statin- and placebo-treated participants of 13%, but only one trial specifically queried about muscle problems. Three trials used a run-in period to eliminate participants with statin intolerance and noncompliance. The percentage of muscle problems tended to be higher with statin treatment (12.7%) than with placebo group (12.4%, P = .06). This small difference probably reflects a high background rate of nonspecific muscle problems in both groups that could not be distinguished from statin-associated myalgia because most clinical trials did not use a standard definition for statin myalgia.",

However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of three different statins (fluvastatin, atorvastatin and pravastatin) on H2S formation in raw264.7 macrophages. There was a remarkable rise in H2S level in fluvastatin- and atorvastatin-stimulated macrophages, while pravastatin failed to show any significant effect on it. Moreover, fluvastatin and atorvastatin enhanced the mRNA and protein expression of cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE) in dose- and time-dependent manners. Fluvastatin also markedly enhanced the CSE activity. However, fluvastatin did not alter the mRNA or protein expression of another H2S-producing enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. Blockade of CSE with its inhibitor dl-propargylglycine (PAG) or siRNA markedly reduced the H2S level in fluvastatin-stimulated macrophages. In addition, fluvastatin elevated Akt phosphorylation, which occurred as early as 15 min after treatment, peaked at 1h, and lasted at least 3h. Both PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 \u03bcM) and Akt inhibitor perifosine (10\u03bcM) were able to reverse the increases of CSE mRNA and H2S production in fluvastatin-stimulated macrophages. Last, we showed that fluvastatin reduced the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory molecules such as IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 in LPS-treated macrophages, which were completely reversed by CSE inhibitor PAG. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that statins may up-regulate CSE expression/activity and subsequently elevate H2S generation by activating Akt signaling pathway and also imply that CSE-H2S pathway plays a critical role in the anti-inflammation elicited by statins.",

As a result, therapeutic targets were developed to increase concentrations of HDL-C. Subsequently, clinical trials of high-intensity statins have not supported this previously well-established association. In trials of high-intensity statin therapy, low HDL particle concentration (HDL-P) has been associated with an increased risk of future cardiovascular events. Therefore, strategies that increase HDL-C without expanding the pool of HDL-P with its rich proteome/lipidome do not seem to be an effective strategy.

Growing evidence supports theory that statins exhibit neuroprotective action in acute stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis or epilepsy. Hereby, we present available experimental data regarding action of this group of drugs on seizure activity and neuronal cell death. The most commonly examined statins, such as atorvastatin and simvastatin, display anticonvulsant action with only inconsiderable exceptions. However, the mechanism of this effect remains unexplained. Simvastatin, as a lipophilic statin, which can pass blood-brain barrier easily, was recommended as the best candidate for an anticonvulsant agent. Nevertheless, it is still indistinct, whether the protective activity of statins depends on cholesterol lowering properties or its pleiotropic characteristics.

Accordingly, coadministration of drugs affecting the metabolic activities of gut microbes (e.g., antibiotics) may lead to drug-drug interactions (DDI). In this study, gut microbiota-mediated DDI were investigated by studying the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin in antibiotic-treated rats. Incubation of lovastatin with human and rat fecalase preparations produced four metabolites, M1 (demethylbutyryl metabolite), M4 (hydroxylated metabolite), M8 (the active hydroxy acid metabolite), and M9 (hydroxylated M8), indicating involvement of the gut microbiota in lovastatin metabolism. The plasma concentration-time profiles of M8 were compared after oral administration of lovastatin to control rats or those treated with either ampicillin (100 mg/kg) or an antibiotic mixture consisting of cefadroxil (150 mg/kg), oxytetracycline (300 mg/kg), and erythromycin (300 mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that systemic exposure to M8 was significantly lower in antibiotic-treated rats compared with controls. In addition, fecal M8 formation decreased by 58.3 and 59.9% in the ampicillin- and antibiotic mixture-treated rats, respectively. These results suggested that antibiotic intake may reduce the biotransformation of orally administered drugs by gut microbiota and that the subsequent impact on microbiota metabolism could result in altered systemic concentrations of either the intact drug and/or its metabolite(s).",

In\u00a0vitro characterizations indicated the successful HA decoration onto the surface of LT-rHDL, which could be indirectly verified by the increased particle size, enhanced negative surface charge and reduced in\u00a0vitro drug release rate after HA decoration. Compared with rHDL without HA, HA decoration endowed rHDL with better atherosclerotic lesions targeting efficiency and lower liver accumulation, proved by results from ex\u00a0vivo imaging and tissue distribution. Furthermore, atheroprotective efficacy in model animal showed that HA-LT-rHDL had the best potent efficacy than other LT preparations, which was demonstrated by the fewest atherosclerotic lesions sizes, the most minimum mean intima-media thickness (MIT), the lowest macrophage infiltration and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), respectively.

Due to the significant health risk, it is prudent to attempt to lower arterial calcification burden in CKD. Treatment of hyperlipidemia with statin has failed to lower atherosclerotic and arterial calcification burden. Data on diabetes and blood pressure controls as well as smoking cessation on cardiovascular outcomes in CKD population are limited. Currently available treatment options include non-calcium containing phosphate binders, low dose active vitamin D, calcimimetic agent and perhaps bisphosphonates, vitamin K and sodium thiosulfate.

The mechanisms involved in these protective actions are not completely understood. This study evaluates whether atorvastatin (ATV) treatment affects the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor in the somatosensory cerebral cortex at short and long periods following ischemia. Sham and ischemic male Wistar rats received 10 mg/kg of ATV or placebo by gavage every 24 hr for 3 consecutive days. The first dose was administered 6 hr after ischemia-reperfusion or the sham operation. ATV treatment resulted in faster recovery of neurological scores than placebo, prevented the appearance of pyknotic neurons, and restored microtubule-associated protein 2 and neuronal nuclei staining to control values in the somatosensory cerebral cortex and the hippocampus at 72 hr and 15 days postischemia. Furthermore, ATV prevented spatial learning and memory deficits caused by cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia reduced the number of GluN1/PSD-95 and GluN2B/PSD-95 colocalization clusters in cortical pyramidal neurons and reduced the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cerebral cortex. These effects of the ischemic insult were prevented by ATV, which also induced GluN2B/PSD-95 colocalization in neuronal processes and an association of GluN2B with TrkB. The GluN2B pharmacological inhibitor ifenprodil prevented the increase in BDNF levels and the motor and cognitive function recovery caused by ATV in ischemic rats. These findings indicate that GluN2B is involved in the neuroprotective mechanism elicited by ATV to promote motor and cognitive recovery after focal cerebral ischemia.",

The LOV-SLHs retained self-emulsifying lipid-associated solubilization benefits and improved drug solubilization by twofold in simulated intestinal condition. SLH-S, with larger surface area (299 m(2)/g), was superior to SLH-A (184 m(2)/g) in optimizing oral bioavailability, suggesting a critical role of the silica geometry. Bioavailability of SLH-S was 2.8- and 1.3-fold higher than pure drug and drug suspension in Gelucire 44/14, respectively.",

Cases of VTE occurring during follow-up were identified and each matched with up to 10 controls from the cohort. Odds ratios (ORs) for the effects of concurrent HT and statin use on the risk of VTE were estimated using conditional logistic regression with interaction terms.", 
    "114": "The cohort included 955,582 postmenopausal women, with 23,505 cases of VTE matched with 231,562 controls. Regardless of any HT use, current use of statins was associated with a decreased risk of VTE (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.87). The interaction between statin use and HT use was of borderline significance (P = 0.053). Consequently, among nonusers of statins, the risk of VTE was elevated with current use of oral estrogen and progestogen combinations (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.45-1.66) but this risk was not elevated among users of statins (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.56-1.73). There was no such modification of the OR with statins and other HT types and formulations.",

    "116": "The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guidelines depart from low-density lipoprotein (LDL) treatment targets and recommend treating four specific patient groups with statins. Statins are the only cholesterol-lowering drugs with randomized trial evidence of benefit for preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The groups are patients with clinical ASCVD; patients ages 40 to 75 years with diabetes and LDL of 70 to 189 mg/dL but no clinical ASCVD; patients 21 years or older with LDL levels of 190 mg/dL or higher; and patients ages 40 to 75 years with LDL of 70 to 189 mg/dL without clinical ASCVD or diabetes but with 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher. Ten-year ASCVD risk may be calculated using the Pooled Cohort Equations. The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) guidelines for blood pressure management recommend a blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg for all adults except those 60 years or older. For the latter group, the JNC 8 recommends a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 150 mm Hg. In another notable change from prior guidelines, the JNC 8 recommends relaxing the systolic blood pressure goal for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease to less than 140 mm Hg from less than 130 mm Hg.", 
    "117": "Current guidelines recommend global risk assessment instruments as the primary approach for determining risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) yields a 10-year risk of CHD, whereas the newer Pooled Cohort Equations yield a 10-year risk of stroke or CHD. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a biomarker for inflammation, along with family history of CHD, can be added to the parameters of the FRS in the Reynolds Risk Score to yield a more refined 10-year CHD risk. Various other biomarkers also can be used. Patients with elevated urinary albumin have higher rates of CHD events, though the incremental yield of adding urinary albumin provides only minor improvements in risk assessment compared with the FRS. Elevated levels of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] also predict increased risk of CHD, and some guidelines recommend Lp(a) testing for patients with strong family histories of premature CHD. Another biomarker is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (Lp-PLA2). Elevated levels indicate increased risk, and some recommendations suggest a lower goal level for low-density lipoprotein with statin therapy when Lp-PLA2 levels are high. Finally, genome-wide association studies for genetic risk of CHD currently are not recommended, but such tests likely will be useful within the next few years.",

    "122": "Preclinical data showed anticancer effects of statins in melanoma, but meta-analyses could not demonstrate a reduced melanoma incidence in statin users. Rather than preventing occurrence, statins might reduce growth and metastatic spread of melanomas and ultimately improve survival. In this population-based study, we investigated the relationship between statin use and survival of melanoma patients. Patients \u226518\u00a0years who were diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma (Breslow thickness >1\u00a0mm) and registered in the Eindhoven Cancer Registry and in PHARMO Database Network between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2010 were eligible. The hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause mortality was calculated by employing adjusted time-dependent and time-fixed Cox proportional hazard models. Disease-specific survival was estimated by means of 3-year relative survival rates (RSR). A control cohort of randomly selected patients using statins from PHARMO Database Network matched on age and gender was used to compare RSR of statin users to the general population. After melanoma diagnosis, 171 of 709 patients used statins. Use of statins showed a nonsignificantly decreased hazard of death (adjusted HR 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50-1.61). After stratification for gender, male but not female statin users showed a favorable outcome compared to nonusers (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32-0.99; HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.62-2.38, respectively). Three-year RSR for male statin users tended to be higher than for nonusers (91% vs. 80.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.06), no differences were observed in women (87.1% vs. 92.5%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.76). Statin use was not associated with an improved survival of melanoma patients. The trend for better survival of male in contrast to female statin users warrants further research.", 
    "123": "Statins are currently used as an effective cholesterol-lowering medication through inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, but recent studies show their potential for bone repair. The bone anabolic effects of statins have been largely attributed to their ability to enhance BMP-2 expression in osteoblast cells. In vitro studies have demonstrated that statins can increase the expression of osteogenic and angiogenic markers such as alkaline phosphatase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and osteocalcin in cells. In vivo, statins have been shown to promote significant new bone growth when injected systemically or locally in combination with a scaffold. The potential anabolic effects of statins on bone make them attractive candidates to support bone regeneration. Since the molecular pathways by which statins induce osteoblast differentiation are still unclear, further investigations are required to elucidate the detailed cellular signaling mechanisms involved to determine the type of statin, optimal dose and mode of delivery to effectively utilize their anabolic effect. This also warrants the development of novel vehicles to locally deliver statins for the desired time periods to support optimal tissue regeneration in vivo.",

    "136": "Despite inflammatory and immune mechanisms participating to atherogenesis and dendritic cells (DCs) driving immune and non-immune tissue injury response, the interactions between DCs and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) possibly relevant to vascular pathology including atherogenesis are still unclear. To address this issue, immature DCs (iDCs) generated from CD14+ cells isolated from healthy donors were matured either with cytokines (mDCs), or co-cultured (ccDCs) with human coronary artery VSMCs (CASMCs) using transwell chambers. Co-culture induced DC immunophenotypical and functional maturation similar to cytokines, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and mixed lymphocyte reaction. In turn, factors from mDCs and ccDCs induced CASMC migration. MCP-1 and TNF\u03b1, secreted from DCs, and IL-6 and MCP-1, secreted from CASMCs, were primarily involved. mDCs adhesion to CASMCs was enhanced by CASMC pre-treatment with IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were involved, since the expression of specific mRNAs for these molecules increased and adhesion was inhibited by neutralizing antibodies to the counter-receptors CD11c and CD18. Adhesion was also inhibited by CASMC pre-treatment with the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor atorvastatin and the PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone, which suggests a further mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of these drugs. Adhesion of DCs to VSMCs was shown also in vivo in rat carotid 7 to 21 days after crush and incision injury. The findings indicate that DCs and VSMCs can interact with reciprocal stimulation, possibly leading to perpetuate inflammation and vascular wall remodelling, and that the interaction is enhanced by a cytokine-rich inflammatory environment and down-regulated by HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors and PPAR\u03b3 agonists.", 
    "137": "Co-enzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Most cells are sensitive to co-enzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) deficiency. This deficiency has been implicated in several clinical disorders such as heart failure, hypertension, Parkinson's disease and obesity. The lipid lowering drug statin inhibits conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate and lowers plasma Co-Q10 concentrations. However, supplementation with Co-Q10 improves the pathophysiological condition of statin therapy. Recent evidence suggests that Co-Q10 supplementation may be useful for the treatment of obesity, oxidative stress and the inflammatory process in metabolic syndrome. The anti-inflammatory response and lipid metabolizing effect of Co-Q10 is probably mediated by transcriptional regulation of inflammation and lipid metabolism. This paper reviews the evidence showing beneficial role of Co-Q10 supplementation and its potential mechanism of action on contributing factors of metabolic and cardiovascular complications.",

Treatment with atorvastatin 80\u00a0mg led to a reduction in overall risk of CV disease in both patients with and without inflammatory joint disease compared to patients receiving the conventional/low-dose statin treatment. Statin discontinuation in RA patients was associated with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction or CV mortality. Myalgia, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea may be more frequent in RA patients than in controls.",

However, the antidepressant property of statins has not been well examined. This study aimed at examining the antidepressant-like effects of statins in rats exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS). We found that animals exposed to CMS for 4 weeks developed depressive-like state, shown by forced swim test and sucrose preference test. However, these CMS-induced behavioral changes were reversed by simvastatin (5 or 10mg/kg/day) for 14 days, comparable to imipramine (10mg/kg/day) treatment. Locomotor activity and anxiety-like behaviors were not altered by CMS or these treatments. These results demonstrated antidepressant-like effects of statin in CMS model of rats and suggested the potential that statins could be used to facilitate antidepressant treatment in clinical setting.", 
    "144": "A new capillary electrophoresis method to measure human blood plasma arginine and citrulline levels in a single run without derivatization was established. After adding homoarginine as internal standard, plasma proteins were removed by a 90:10 v/v acetonitrile/ammonia mixture. Arginine and citrulline were detected by an ultraviolet detector at 190 nm and separated in 11.65 and 20.43 min, respectively, by using a 75 mmol/L Tris phosphate solution at pH 1.2 as a background electrolyte. Limits of detection were 0.8 and 5 \u03bcmol/L for arginine and citrulline, respectively. Precision tests indicated a good repeatability of migration times and of peak area both for citrulline (CV% = 0.82 and 3.19) and arginine (CV% = 0.65 and 2.79). The CV% for intra- and interassay tests were, respectively, 1.84 and 3.23 for citrulline and 1.25 and 1.50 for arginine. Mean recovery was 101.5 and 98.5% for citrulline and arginine, respectively. The performance of the developed method was assessed by measuring plasma arginine levels in 52 subjects and the data were compared with those obtained by our previous assay. The new method was then applied to assess plasma citrulline and arginine in ten chronic kidney disease patients under hypolipidemic therapy with statin.", 
    "145": "LPIN1 encodes lipin-1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid to form diacylglycerol. Homozygous LPIN1 gene mutations cause severe rhabdomyolysis, and heterozygous LPIN1 missense mutations may promote statin-induced myopathy. We demonstrate that lipin-1-related myopathy in the mouse is associated with a blockade in autophagic flux and accumulation of aberrant mitochondria. Lipin-1 PAP activity is required for maturation of autolysosomes, through its activation of the protein kinase D (PKD)-Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling cascade. Statin treatment also reduces PKD activation and autophagic flux, which are compounded by diminished mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) abundance in lipin-1-haploinsufficent and -deficient muscle. Lipin-1 restoration in skeletal muscle prevents myonecrosis and statin toxicity in\u00a0vivo, and activated PKD rescues autophagic flux in lipin-1-deficient cells.

The so called \"cardiovascular risk factors\" are associated with endothelial dysfunction, that reduces NO bioavailability, increases oxidative stress, and promotes inflammation contributing therefore to the development of atherosclerosis. The significant role of endothelial dysfunction in the development of atherosclerosis emphasizes the need for efficient therapeutic interventions. During the last years statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, antioxidants, beta-blockers and insulin sensitizers have been evaluated for their ability to restore endothelial function (Briasoulis et al., 2012). As there is not a straightforward relationship between therapeutic interventions and improvement of endothelial function but rather a complicated interrelationship between multiple cellular and sub-cellular targets, research has been focused on the understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the development of novel diagnostic invasive and non-invasive methods has allowed the early detection of endothelial dysfunction expanding the role of therapeutic interventions and our knowledge. In the current review we present the available data concerning the contribution of endothelial dysfunction to atherogenesis and review the methods that assess endothelial function with a view to understand the multiple targets of therapeutic interventions. Finally we focus on the classic and novel therapeutic approaches aiming to improve endothelial dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms.", 
    "159": "An analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System database found evidence suggesting that the combination of the cholesterol-lowering drug pravastatin and the antidepressant paroxetine, produced a significant increase in average blood glucose measures.", 
    "160": "Our intent was to investigate the reproducibility of these findings by conducting a similar analysis of administrative and prescription claims data from patients receiving primary care at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation.", 
    "161": "We conducted an observational, retrospective review of 2149 adult patient records to compare mean measures of blood glucose between groups receiving concomitant paroxetine and pravastatin with the pooled means of those receiving 19 different combinations of a statin and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare random glucose, fasting glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin mean values, while adjusting for the covariates of age, gender, body mass index, and weight in patients with and without a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.", 
    "162": "A total of 65 observations were analyzed from patients receiving concomitant paroxetine and pravastatin and 2084 from those receiving 19 other statin-SSRI pairs. The ANCOVA showed that significant covariate relationships included the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, male gender, and body weight. After adjusting for covariates, no significant difference was found between the 3 mean glucose measures of the pravastatin-paroxetine pair groups and the corresponding means of the pooled statin-SSRI pair groups (P > 0.05).", 
    "163": "Outpatients receiving concomitant pravastatin and paroxetine did not have significantly different mean glucose measures as compared with those receiving other statin-SSRI drug combinations.", 
    "164": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have shown to decrease mortality and cardiovascular morbidity especially in high-risk patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Aim of this study was to assess the association between ACEI or ARB treatment (ACEI/ARB) at hospital discharge and long-term survival after AMI in real-life patient care. From a German population-based AMI registry, 3,544 patients (75.4% men), aged 28 to 74\u00a0years, hospitalized with an incident AMI between 2000 and 2008, surviving at least 24\u00a0hours and treated with \u03b2 blockers and antiplatelet agents at discharge were included in this study. All data were collected by standardized interviews and chart review. End point of this study was all-cause mortality at 3 follow-up periods: 1, 3, and 5\u00a0years after AMI. Mortality was assessed for all registered patients in 2010. Survival analyses and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted. Of the 3,544 patients, 83.7% received ACEI/ARB and 90.1% were treated with statins at hospital discharge. During a median follow-up period of 5.0\u00a0years (interquartile range 1.0\u00a0years), 9.3% patients died. In the multivariable Cox models adjusting for a number of covariates, use of ACEI/ARB showed a significantly inverse relation with 1-, 3-, and 5-year mortality (e.g., 5-year mortality: hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 0.94, p\u00a0= 0.015), and the hazard ratios for mortality did not differ significantly between the 3 examined follow-up periods. In conclusion, use of ACEI/ARB at hospital discharge is independently associated with long-term survival benefit in patients with incident AMI already treated with other guideline-recommended cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "165": "Debate exists about the efficacy of \u03b2-blockers in myocardial infarction and their required duration of usage in contemporary practice.", 
    "166": "We conducted a MEDLINE/EMBASE/CENTRAL search for randomized trials evaluating \u03b2-blockers in myocardial infarction enrolling at least 100 patients. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Analysis was performed stratifying trials into reperfusion-era (> 50% undergoing reperfusion or receiving aspirin/statin) or pre-reperfusion-era trials.", 
    "167": "Sixty trials with 102,003 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. In the acute myocardial infarction trials, a significant interaction (Pinteraction\u00a0= .02) was noted such that \u03b2-blockers reduced mortality in the pre-reperfusion (incident rate ratio [IRR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.94) but not in the reperfusion era (IRR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.92-1.05). In the pre-reperfusion era, \u03b2-blockers reduced cardiovascular mortality (IRR 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98), myocardial infarction (IRR 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.97), and angina (IRR 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.95), with no difference for other outcomes. In the reperfusion era, \u03b2-blockers reduced myocardial infarction (IRR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62-0.83) (number needed to treat to benefit [NNTB]\u00a0= 209) and angina (IRR 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.98) (NNTB\u00a0= 26) at the expense of increase in heart failure (IRR 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16) (number needed to treat to harm [NNTH]\u00a0= 79), cardiogenic shock (IRR 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18-1.41) (NNTH\u00a0= 90), and drug discontinuation (IRR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.55-1.73), with no benefit for other outcomes. Benefits for recurrent myocardial infarction and angina in the reperfusion era appeared to be short term (30 days).", 
    "168": "In contemporary practice of treatment of myocardial infarction, \u03b2-blockers have no mortality benefit but reduce recurrent myocardial infarction and angina (short-term) at the expense of increase in heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and drug discontinuation. The guideline authors should reconsider the strength of recommendations for \u03b2-blockers post myocardial infarction.", 
    "169": "A 46-year old man with a chronic hepatitis C virus infection received triple therapy with ribavirin, pegylated interferon and telaprevir. The patient also received simvastatin. One month after starting the antiviral therapy, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he developed rhabdomyolysis. At admission simvastatin and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because toxicity due to a drug-drug interaction was suspected. The creatine kinase peaked at 62,246 IU/L and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline. The patient's renal function remained unaffected. Fourteen days after hospitalization, creatine kinase level had returned to 230 IU/L and the patient was discharged. Telaprevir was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with simvastatin according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale. The interaction is due to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated simvastatin clearance. Simvastatin plasma concentration increased 30 times in this patient and statin induced muscle toxicity is related to the concentration of the statin in blood. In conclusion, with this case we illustrate that telaprevir as well as statins are susceptible to clinical relevant drug-drug interactions.", 
    "170": "Although an initial case series suggested that use of statins in pregnancy carried teratogenic risk, a recent meta-analysis of controlled observational studies has failed to corroborate this. A large number of potentially beneficial uses of statins in pregnant women have prompted a new evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of these agents in pregnancy.",

    "172": "An elevated level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is directly associated with development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which may present as coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. The new cholesterol management guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association aim to address a comprehensive approach to prevent and reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The new guidelines recommend initiation of heart healthy lifestyle modifications and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitor (\"statin\") therapy in individuals who are at a high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. It is estimated that these guidelines could result in \"statin\" therapy for one in every three adults in the United States. This article presents a review of the current cholesterol management guidelines, recommendations from relevant randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses obtained from the searches in Medline/PubMed and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and publications from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force.", 
    "173": "Hypercholesterolemia, is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Undestanding of the biochemical mechanisms that regulate the expression of the low density lipoproteins receptor (LDLR) and the hepatic clearance of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) paved the way to the statin therapy as the gold standard for CVD prevention. The discovery of proteins that regulate - at a post-translational level - the activity of the LDLR has been a major breakthrough in developing new cholesterol-lowering drugs. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key modulator of the LDLR degradation in the liver. Genetic studies confirmed that in humans PCSK9 mutations associate with hypercholesterolemia and hypocholesterolemia (gain-of-function or loss-of-function variants respectively). Moreover, PCSK9 is up-regulated by statin treatment and limits the efficacy of these agents. These findings led to the development of PCSK9 inhibitors. Anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies showed encouraging results and are currently being evaluated in phase III clinical trials. The aim of this short review is to describe the new frontier of PCSK9 inhibition in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Emphasis here is given to critical emerging issues linked to PCSK9 physiology and pharmacology, which will require future investigation to definitely address the potential of anti-PCSK9 drugs in clinical practice.", 
    "174": "Skin-wound healing is a complex and dynamic biological process involving inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Recent studies have shown that statins are new therapeutical options because of their actions, such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity, on vasodilation, endothelial dysfunction and neoangiogenesis, which are independent of their lipid-lowering action. Our aim was to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on tissue repair after acute injury in healthy animals. Rats were divided into four groups: placebo-treated (P), topical atorvastatin-treated (AT), oral atorvastatin-treated (AO), topical and oral atorvastatin-treated (ATO). Under anesthesia, rats were wounded with an 8-mm punch in the dorsal region. Lesions were photographed on Days 0, 1, 3, 7, 10, 12, and 14 post-injury and samples taken on Days 1, 3, 7, and 14 for protein-expression analysis of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), interleukin (IL)-10, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Upon macroscopic examination, we observed significant reductions of lesion areas in groups AT, AO, and ATO compared to the P group. Additionally, AT and AO groups showed increased expression of IRS-1, PI3K, Akt, GSK-3, and IL-10 on Days 1 and 3 when compared with the P group. All atorvastatin-treated groups showed higher expression of IRS-1, PI3K, Akt, GSK-3, IL-10, eNOS, VEGF, and ERK on Day 7. On Days 1, 3, and 7, all atorvastatin-treated groups showed lower expression of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 when compared with the P group. We conclude that atorvastatin accelerated tissue repair of acute lesions in rats and modulated expressions of proteins and cytokines associated with cell-growth pathways.", 
    "175": "Mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles regulated by a complex network of proteins that are vital for many cellular functions. Because mitochondrial modulators can impact many aspects of cellular homeostasis, their identification and validation has proven challenging. It requires the measurement of multiple parameters in parallel to understand the exact nature of the changes induced by such compounds. We developed a platform of assays scoring for mitochondrial function in two complementary models systems, mammalian cells and C. elegans. We first optimized cell culture conditions and established the mitochondrial signature of 1,200 FDA-approved drugs in liver cells. Using cell-based and C. elegans assays, we further defined the metabolic effects of two pharmacological classes that emerged from our hit list, i.e. imidazoles and statins. We found that these two drug classes affect respiration through different and cholesterol-independent mechanisms in both models. Our screening strategy enabled us to unequivocally identify compounds that have toxic or beneficial effects on mitochondrial activity. Furthermore, the cross-species approach provided novel mechanistic insight and allowed early validation of hits that act on mitochondrial function.", 
    "176": "The effects of high-potency statins on renal function are controversial. To address the impact of statins on renal morpho-functional aspects, normotensive young mice were treated with rosuvastatin (Rvs). Moreover, because statins may impair mitochondrial function, mice received either dietary supplementation with an amino acid mixture enriched in essential amino acids (EAAm), which we previously demonstrated to increase mitochondrial biogenesis in muscle or an unsupplemented control diet for 1\u00a0month. Mitochondrial biogenesis and function, apoptosis, and insulin signaling pathway events were studied, primarily in cortical proximal tubules. By electron microscopy analysis, mitochondria were more abundant and more heterogeneous in size, with dense granules in the inner matrix, in Rvs- and Rvs plus EAAm-treated animals. Rvs administration increased protein kinase B and endothelial nitric oxide synthase phosphorylation, but the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway was not affected. Rvs increased the expression of sirtuin 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1, cytochrome oxidase type IV, cytochrome c, and mitochondrial biogenesis markers. Levels of glucose-regulated protein 75 (Grp75), B-cell lymphoma 2, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 were increased in cortical proximal tubules, and expression of the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial chaperone Grp78 was decreased. EAAm supplementation maintained or enhanced these changes. Rvs promotes mitochondrial biogenesis, with a probable anti-apoptotic effect. EAAm boosts these processes and may contribute to the efficient control of cellular energetics and survival in the mouse kidney. This suggests that appropriate nutritional interventions may enhance the beneficial actions of Rvs, and could potentially prevent chronic renal side effects.", 
    "177": "Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a worldwide diffuse intervention, but may be associated with distal plaque component embolization, and sometimes major and minor stroke. Statin use has been demonstrated to reduce atherosclerotic plaque burden, but its effect in reducing distal embolization during carotid stenting has not yet been well validated.", 
    "178": "With the Rosuvastatin Pretreatment to Reduce Embolization during Carotid Artery Stenting trial, we aim to discover if a pretreatement with high doses of rosuvastatin in dyslipidemic patients is able to reduce periprocedural cerebral ischemic complications following carotid stenting.", 
    "179": "This is a phase III prospective, randomized controlled trial. All consecutive patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis at least 80% will be randomized to a 6-week rosuvastatin treatment followed by carotid stenting, and to direct carotid stenting. Carotid stenting will be performed following common practice with distal or proximal embolic protection. The primary efficacy end point of the trial will be the prevalence of 'relevant' embolization during CAS, as a surrogate end point for cerebral ischemic complications. Other laboratory and clinical data will be registered and patients will be followed up to 1 year. In order to obtain the expected superiority of statin pretreatment on primary end point, a population of 130 patients will be enrolled into the study.", 
    "180": "In conclusion, with the Rosuvastatin Pretreatment to Reduce Embolization during Carotid Artery Stenting trial, we want to evaluate whether a high dose of rosuvastatin for 6 weeks before CAS in asymptomatic patients with severe carotid stenosis is able to reduce the rate of plaque embolization during the procedure, thus suggesting a possible reduction in cerebral ischemic complications.", 
    "181": "APOE p.Leu167del is a rare genetic variant described in 38 cases in the literature with a range of clinical phenotypes. Three phenotypes can be associated with the APOE p.Leu167del variant: Inherited lipemic splenomegaly (also known as sea-blue histiocytosis) characterized by hypertriglyceridemia and splenomegaly. Variable manifestations include thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, and cardiovascular disease. Autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) characterized by markedly elevated LDL cholesterol levels that leads to premature morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) characterized by variable elevations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, or LDL cholesterol and a high risk of premature ASCVD. It has been suggested that the phenotype associated with the APOE p.Leu167del variant may depend on multiple factors, including sex, APOE genotype, control of hyperlipidemia, gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interactions, or perhaps epigenetic and other non-Mendelian effects.", 
    "182": "Diagnosis relies on detection of a heterozygous APOE p.Leu167del pathogenic allelic variant. Determining whether the second APOE allele is the benign variant e2 or the benign variant e3 may be of some clinical predictive value.", 
    "183": "Treatment of manifestations: No formal management guidelines exist. Individuals with hyperlipidemia should be treated according to their overall cardiovascular risk profile. Treatment for individuals with documented ASCVD or at high risk of developing ASCVD begins with lifestyle changes (adherence to a heart-healthy diet, exercise, tobacco avoidance, maintenance of a healthy weight) and may also include statin, fibrate, high-dose fish oil, and/or niacin therapy. Although no interventions are known to prevent disease progression, it has been suggested that treatment of dyslipidemia may prevent development of splenomegaly. Splenectomy should be avoided as it may worsen hyperlipidemia. Liver function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia are managed in a routine manner. Diabetes mellitus (if present) should be well controlled. Surveillance: No formal surveillance guidelines exist. The authors suggest the following: Lipoprotein profile one year after diagnosis and every 2-5 years thereafter (if normal). If abnormal, follow at regular intervals for treatment of hyperlipidemia. Liver function panel, albumin, INR (prothrombin time) one year after diagnosis and every 2-5 years thereafter (if normal). Platelet count one year after diagnosis and every 2-5 years thereafter (if normal). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Splenectomy, which may worsen the hypertriglyceridemia. For those with splenomegaly: contact sports given the increased risk for splenic rupture. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Clarifying the genetic status of relatives at risk of inheriting the APOE p.Leu167del variant allows early adoption of preventive measures and surveillance. Pregnancy management: In a woman with the APOE p.Leu167del variant, triglyceride levels should be measured when pregnancy is identified and at least one to two times later in pregnancy as severe hypertriglyceridemia (>500 mg/dL) in pregnancy increases the risk for pancreatitis and fetal and maternal death. Before taking a medication during pregnancy, a pregnant woman should discuss with her physician the risks and benefits of that medication.", 
    "184": "The APOE p.Leu167del variant is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of APOE p.Leu167del-related lipid disorders caused by de novo mutation is unknown. The phenotype associated with the APOE p.Leu167del variant appears to depend on multiple factors. Each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of inheriting the variant. Prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies is possible; however, requests for prenatal testing for conditions such as APOE p.Leu167del-related lipid disorders are not common.",

    "187": "Clinical factors including age\u226580 years, symptomatic status, procedure within 2 weeks of symptoms, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and hemispheric TIA were associated with stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and death within 1 month after carotid artery stent placement. Angiographic factors including left carotid artery intervention, stenosis > 90%, ulcerated and calcified plaques, lesion length > 10mm, thrombus at the site, ostial involvement, predilation without EPD, ICA-CCA angulation > 60%, aortic arch type III, and aortic arch calcification were also associated with 1 month stroke and/or death. Intra-procedural platelet GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors, protamine use, multiple stents, predilatation prior to stent placement were associated with stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and death after carotid artery stent placement. Intraprocedural use of embolic protection devices and stent design (open versus closed cell design) did not demonstrate a consistent relationship with 1 month stroke and/or death. Procedural statin use, and operator and center experience of more than 50 procedures per year were protective for 1 month stroke and/or death.",

EEGs were reviewed for clinical abnormalities, including IEDs, by readers blinded to participants' behavioral symptoms. Between-group differences in baseline characteristics of participants with and without IEDs were analyzed. Within-subject analyses examined the association between the presence of IEDs and changes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms.", 
    "191": "Of 85 EEGs, 43 (51%) were abnormal, predominantly because of IEDs. Only one subject had documented clinical seizures. IEDs clustered in 13 subjects (57%), whereas 9 subjects (39%) had EEGs consistently free of IEDs. While there were no significant group differences in sex, age, intellectual disability, language level, or baseline ADHD symptoms, autistic symptoms tended to be more prevalent in the \"IED\" group (according to Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 criteria). Within individuals, the presence of IEDs on a particular EEG predicted, on average, a 27% increase in ADHD symptom severity.", 
    "192": "Epileptiform discharges are common in SLOS, despite a relatively low prevalence of epilepsy. Fluctuations in the presence of epileptiform discharges within individual children with a developmental disability syndrome may be associated with fluctuations in ADHD symptomatology, even in the absence of clinical seizures."
