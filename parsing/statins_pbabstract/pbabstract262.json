CVD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant recipients. It is therefore of interest and clinical value to introduce agents that effectively and safely reduce the incidence of this outcome. In the present review we consider the potential benefits of statin administration in adults who have undergone solid organ (mainly renal, heart and liver) transplantation, as well as in paediatric transplant patients. We also briefly review the effects of combination therapy with ezetimibe and statins in this population. Overall, statins are efficient and safe drugs for the management of dyslipidaemias in transplant populations, and in most trials they had a beneficial effect on long-term survival rates, CVD events and rejection rates. The transplanted population is different from other patient groups, mostly due to concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Statins, at an appropriate dosage, should be prescribed to dyslipidaemic transplanted patients but they should be closely monitored for adverse effects.", 
    "1": "Primarily statin drugs inhibit hepatic 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is responsible for the reduction in circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Several findings from recent research studies indicate that statins have multiple actions that favorably influence key factors involved in the atherogenic process. These so-called pleiotropic properties affect various aspects of cell function, inflammation, coagulation, and vasomotor activity. These effects are mediated either indirectly through LDL cholesterol reduction or via a direct effect on cellular functions. Such actions may contribute to the early cardiovascular benefit observed in several outcome trials with statin drugs therapy. Although many of the pleiotropic properties of statins may be a class effect, some may be unique to certain agents and account for differences in their pharmacological activity. This review summarise the results of the major outcome trials of statins and non-statins therapy and the possible mechanisms beyond lipid lowering contributing to plaque stability.", 
    "2": "We conducted a pharmaco-economic analysis of the prospective peri-operative studies of beta-blocker and statin administration for major elective non-cardiac surgery, using the Discovery Health claims costs for 2004. This analysis shows that acute peri-operative beta-blockade and statin therapy could result in a cost saving through a reduction in major perioperative cardiovascular complications in patients with an expected peri-operative major cardiovascular complication rate exceeding 10% following elective major non-cardiac surgery. The validity of these findings is dependent on whether the incidence of cardiovascular complications following major noncardiac surgery reported in the international literature is found to be similar in South Africa.",

    "4": "The internet-based, computer simulation model is made up of two decision analytic sub-models, the first utilizing Monte Carlo simulation, and the second applying Markov modeling techniques. Monte Carlo simulation generates a baseline cohort for long-term simulation by assigning an individual lipid profile to each patient, and applying the treatment effects of interventions under investigation. The Markov model then estimates the long-term clinical (coronary heart disease events, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy) and cost outcomes up to a lifetime horizon, based on risk equations from the Framingham study. Internal and external validation analyses were performed.", 
    "5": "The results of the model validation analyses, plotted against corresponding real-life values from Framingham, 4S, AFCAPS/TexCAPS, and a meta-analysis by Gordon et al., showed that the majority of values were close to the y = x line, which indicates a perfect fit. The R2 value was 0.9575 and the gradient of the regression line was 0.9329, both very close to the perfect fit (= 1).",

Efficacy end points included percent changes from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (primary) and proportion of patients attaining LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL (secondary).", 
    "9": "A total of 1229 patients participated in the study. Significantly greater mean reductions were found in LDL-C levels with ezetimibe/simvastatin, 10/20 mg/d (-53.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -55.4% to -51.8%), than with atorvastatin, 10 mg/d (-38.3%; 95% CI, -40.1% to -36.5%; P < .001) or 20 mg/d (-44.6%; 95% CI, -46.4% to -42.8%; P < .001), and with ezetimibe/simvastatin, 10/40 mg/d (-57.6%; 95% CI, -59.4% to -55.8%), vs atorvastatin, 40 mg/d (-50.9%; 95% CI, -52.7% to -49.1%; P < .001). Ezetimibe/simvastatin was also superior to atorvastatin in attainment of LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL (P < .001 for all dose comparisons). Significantly better improvements with ezetimibe/simvastatin than with atorvastatin (P < or = .001) were observed for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Ezetimibe/ simvastatin, 10/20 mg/d, reduced high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and triglyceride levels significantly more than atorvastatin, 10 mg/d (P = .02), with comparable reductions at other doses. Incidences of clinical adverse events, including serious drug-related and prespecified gastrointestinal-, gallbladder-, and hepatitis-related allergic reactions or rash events, and laboratory adverse events, including repeated elevation of hepatic transaminases or creatine kinase levels, were similar for both treatments.",

    "11": "This study assessed the cost effectiveness of treatments for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease in Spain, which included smoking cessation and reductions in blood cholesterol levels and BP. Cost-effectiveness ratios (measured in terms of US dollars per life-year gained) ranged from 2,608 US dollars to 8,058 US dollars per life-year gained for therapies aimed at smoking cessation, from 7,061 US dollars to 126,990 US dollars per life-year gained for antihypertensive drug treatment, from 15,487 US dollars to 1,689,022 US dollars per life-year gained for the drug treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and from 12,792 US dollars to 149,246 US dollars per life-year gained for cholesterol-lowering diets. In individuals with blood cholesterol levels of 7.7 mmol/L, cost-effectiveness ratios of drug treatment ranged from 33,850 US dollars to 302,088 US dollars. Cost-effectiveness ratios were lower in men than in women for all programmes evaluated. Cost-effectiveness analysis of cholesterol-lowering drugs indicated that lovastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) was more cost effective than cholestyramine (bile acid sequestrant) and gemfibrozil (fibrate). Hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol and nifedipine were more cost effective antihypertensive treatments than prazosin and captopril. Cost-effectiveness ratios obtained in this study could be used to develop disease management strategies to facilitate the efficient use of healthcare resources and to reduce costs. When resources for coronary heart disease are limited, available treatments should be selected on the basis of their average and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.", 
    "12": "(1) For patients with hypercholesterolaemia requiring primary or secondary prevention, pravastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin have a proven benefit in terms of mortality and/or morbidity. Gemfibrozil and cholestyramine have a proven impact on morbidity. (2) The lipid-lowering properties of immediate-release nicotinic acid have been known for about 50 years, as have its frequent and sometimes severe adverse effects. About 70% of patients experience cutaneous flushing, and 20-30% develop gastrointestinal adverse effects. Hepatotoxic effects occur in about 2% of patients, especially in those using high daily doses or sustained-release formulations. (3) The clinical evaluation of immediate-release nicotinic acid is mainly based on two comparative placebo-controlled trials. One, involving 5000 patients monitored on average for 15 years, showed no effect on survival. One trial suggested that immediate-release nicotinic acid reduced the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. (4) Sustained-release nicotinic acid has not been evaluated in terms of its effect on morbidity or mortality. It has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and to raise the HDL cholesterol level. (5) This new pharmaceutical formulation has a profile and frequency of known adverse effects similar to those of immediate-release nicotinic acid. (6) When hypercholesterolaemia persists despite an appropriate diet, it is best to use one drug with a proven preventive impact on mortality and/or morbidity. This is not the case for sustained-release nicotinic acid. (7) When statin therapy is inadequate, it remains to be shown whether adding another cholesterol-lowering drug is beneficial in terms of morbidity and mortality. If, in rare cases, combination with a statin is envisaged, it is best to use gemfibrozil or cholestyramine. Note that gemfibrozil should only be combined with a statin with the greatest caution.",

The observed parameters were measured before and after 3 months of therapy.", 
    "15": "When comparing total cholesterolemia, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, there were significant decreases after a 3-month treatment. By contrast, no significant difference was observed when we compared the values of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1 and, especially, of cICAM-1. Our results demonstrate the well-known capacity of fluvastatin to lower LDL- and total cholesterol; however, it failed to reduce cICAM after a 3-month treatment.", 
    "16": "It can be concluded that a 3-month therapy with fluvastatin does not decrease cICAM-1 levels, despite normalization of cholesterol levels. The implication is that cholesterol may not induce endothelial activation by the initial upregulation of this adhesive molecule.",

The diabetic patients more often showed gangrene (P<0.05) and infra-inguinal atherosclerosis (84% vs 67%, P=0.001). The patients with diabetes showed a better lipid profile (total cholesterol 4.6 vs 5 mmol/L, P=0.006 and lower LDL-cholesterol (2.7 vs 3.1 mmol/L, P=0.010) despite the same frequency of statin treatment. They showed a higher creatinine (149 vs 117 micromol/L, P=0.0003) than the non-diabetic patients. Of the inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) was equally elevated in both groups. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) was increased among the diabetic patients (2.6 vs 1.8 pg/mL, P<0.05), and this difference was most evident in those with gangrene. Neopterin was also higher among the diabetic patients (31 vs 21 mmol/L, P<0.01), but CD40L was not different between groups.", 
    "20": "Diabetes mellitus was very common in CLI patients, and more often combined with renal impairment and infra-inguinal atherosclerosis. The inflammatory markers TNF-a and neopterin were elevated in patients with diabetes as compared to non-diabetic patients, but this difference cannot explain why CLI is 10 times more frequent in diabetic patients.", 
    "21": "Neovascularisation of atherosclerotic plaques correlates with increased plaque instability and subsequent risk of vascular complications. Diabetics have widespread atherosclerotic involvement of the arterial tree and a more aggressive form of the disease culminating in increased plaque instability. This results in a greater incidence of ischaemic sequelae than in non-diabetics. Previous studies have examined neovascularisation as a marker of plaque instability in both the carotid and coronary territories and revealed a greater degree in both symptomatic and diabetic patients. This is the first study to examine intimal neovascularisation in lower limb peripheral arterial disease.", 
    "22": "Arterial specimens were taken from 20 patients, ten of whom were type 2 diabetics, undergoing major lower limb amputation for unreconstructable critical ischaemia. Sections were stained with H&E for morphological assessment and inflammatory cell characterisation. Additional sections underwent immunohistochemical staining for CD31 and von-Willebrand Factor (vWF) and the number of intimal vessels per four 40x magnification fields assessed.", 
    "23": "There was a more prominent inflammatory infiltrate in diabetic subjects compared to non-diabetic controls. Diabetic patients had a greater degree of intimal neovascularisation compared to controls with a median of 11.5 and 2.0 vessels per field respectively (P<0.05). Sub-group analysis revealed that diabetic patients medicating with HMG-CoA Reductase inhibitors (Statins) had a greater degree of neovascularisation compared to those not taking this class of medication.", 
    "24": "Diabetic patients with critical limb ischaemia requiring amputation demonstrate a greater degree of plaque intimal neovascularisation and inflammatory infiltrate compared to their non-diabetic counterparts. This may explain the greater plaque instability and subsequent cardiovascular complications seen in these patients.", 
    "25": "Though statins are fully reimbursed by the public drug programs for seniors in British Columbia (BC) and Ontario, Canada, population-based rates of statin prescription are markedly higher in Ontario. We aimed to assess whether new statin users in BC and Ontario differ in terms of their risk for future coronary heart disease (CHD) events.", 
    "26": "We collected information for 1998-2001 on demographics, outpatient prescriptions, physician visits, hospital admissions, and vital status from administrative databases to compare the proportions of new statin users aged 66 years and older who had evidence of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), chronic CHD, neither ACS nor CHD but diabetes, or none of the above.", 
    "27": "Approximately 15% and 20% of BC and Ontario seniors, respectively, had filled a statin prescription by 2001. Among new statin users in the two provinces, virtually identical proportions had evidence of ACS (8%), chronic CHD (25%), and diabetes (14%), for an overall proportion of roughly 50% at high risk for CHD events.", 
    "28": "New statin users in BC and Ontario were at similar risk for future CHD events. Poorer case selection is unlikely to explain the relatively higher rates of statin prescription in Ontario.", 
    "29": "Abrupt discontinuation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A-reductase inhibitors (statins) is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. To investigate the molecular mechanisms determining the increased cardiovascular risk after statin withdrawal, we studied the effects of statin treatment and withdrawal on angiotensin II (AII) actions in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in culture. In VSMC, AII stimulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), with an EC50% of 0.86 and 3 nM, respectively. Maximal stimulation was observed after 5-10 min of exposure to AII. Pretreatment with 1-3 microM simvastatin for 24h inhibited AII-mediated stimulation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation; without affecting the levels on non-phosphorylated MAPK. Washout of simvastatin produced a rebound increase above control levels of AII-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. As previously reported for other agonists, the rebound increase of AII effects was observed from 1 to 3h after statin withdrawal, and was lost at later times. The basal levels of phosphorylation and the amount of non-phosphorylated kinases were unaffected by statin withdrawal. Similar effects were observed with lovastatin. Our results suggest that statins modulate AII effects in VSMC, and that transient increases in AII effects mediated via the MAPK pathway may play a role in the vascular dysfunction associated with statin withdrawal.", 
    "30": "The association of plaques with outward arterial remodeling and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has been mostly investigated by cross-sectional intravascular ultrasound studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made it possible to noninvasively assess the coronary vessels of patients with chronic coronary artery disease, but no study has been done in patients with ACS. We sought to serially investigate changes in coronary vessel walls of patients with ACS using noninvasive serial MRI.", 
    "31": "A total of 42 segments of coronary arteries from 22 patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation ACS were studied at baseline in the acute phase and at 6 months after stabilization and optimization of medical therapy. Patients received routine medical treatment during this period with control of risk factors. Vessel wall area, maximum wall thickness, mean wall thickness, and lumen area were analyzed longitudinally using MRI.",

The wall/lumen ratio was significantly reduced from 3.7 +/- 1.7 to 2.9 +/- 1.3 (P = .01), suggesting a regression of outward remodeling.", 
    "33": "Patients with ACS have increased coronary vessel wall thickness and area that can regress with stabilization and medical therapy over the period of 6 months. Magnetic resonance imaging can detect and serially follow these changes, monitoring coronary vascular remodeling from the acute to the chronic phase of the disease.", 
    "34": "In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), therapies designed to prevent clinical events are not always associated with significant reduction in coronary obstruction, as measured by quantitative coronary angiography. We set out to explore the relationship between quantitative coronary angiography parameters, baseline characteristics, and clinical events in a large trial of CAD regression with antihypertensive agents.", 
    "35": "Patients randomized to amlodipine, enalapril, or placebo in the CAMELOT trial were followed for 24 months for major ischemic events. Among 431 patients participating in the angiographic and intravascular ultrasound substudy NORMALISE, 298 (99 amlodipine, 96 enalapril, and 103 placebo) had complete angiographic and intravascular ultrasound data. The patients did not differ significantly with respect to baseline characteristics (except for diabetes) or extent of CAD. After 24 months, the change in minimal lumen diameter (MLD) was -0.02 +/- 0.13 for amlodipine, -0.03 +/- 0.12 for enalapril, and -0.03 +/- 0.17 mm for placebo (P = .40). Major ischemic events occurred in 20.2%, 24%, and 25.2%, respectively (P = .68). There was no significant correlation between change in MLD and age, sex, statin therapy, or systolic blood pressure at baseline. The change in MLD did not differ in patients with and without cardiovascular events, regardless of treatment assignment (P = .54). Only the extent of CAD was independently predictive of ischemic events.", 
    "36": "As compared to placebo, amlodipine treatment resulted in fewer ischemic events after 24 months of therapy, but the clinical benefit was not associated with a commensurate improvement in arterial lumen dimensions.", 
    "37": "A substantial number of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) demonstrate a predominance of small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL), which is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In some cases, sdLDL persists after treatment with a statin to reduce levels of LDL. The effect of the addition of a thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone (RSG) (4 mg/day or 8 mg/day) to statin therapy on LDL phenotype and C reactive protein (CRP) levels was investigated in a 12- week, placebo-controlled study of 72 T2DM patients who were well controlled and on a statin, but who had persistently predominant sdLDL. Addition of RSG 8 mg to statin therapy significantly increased LDL buoyancy (relative flotation +0.014, p = 0.003) and LDL particle size (+4.2A, p = 0.001) from baseline and relative to the change with placebo (+0.014 and +3.8A; p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively), and was associated with a non-significant decrease in sdLDL. RSG 8 mg moderately, but significantly, increased total cholesterol (by 12.2%, p = 0.004), LDL-cholesterol (11.2%, p = 0.02) and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)-cholesterol from baseline but did not increase total or LDL apolipoprotein B. RSG 4 mg and 8 mg significantly reduced CRP compared with placebo (-44.9% and -48.0%; p = 0.008 and p = 0.004, respectively), and significantly reduced insulin resistance and fasting plasma glucose from baseline. Addition of RSG to statin therapy may further reduce cardiovascular risk by improving the LDL phenotype, as well as reducing insulin resistance and CRP levels. However, the increase in IDL may be proatherogenic and must be considered when assessing the benefits of rosiglitazone.", 
    "38": "Fibrates have a long history in cardiovascular disease. These drugs raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, reduce triglycerides and improve small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) so would be expected to have large effects in type 2 diabetes, where this is the typical lipid profile. The general trial results with these agents have been confusing, with varying cardiovascular benefits. The Fenofibrate Intervention and Endpoint Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study recruited a low-risk population with a lipid profile that would be more usually treated with a statin. FIELD showed a non-significant 11% reduction (p = 0.16) in the primary end point of coronary events and a significant 11% benefit on the secondary end point of cardiovascular events and procedures (p = 0.04). Most of the benefits were seen in primary prevention and non-fatal myocardial events. Fenofibrate had little effect on HDL-C; the effects of the trial are consistent with the LDL-C reducing potential of this drug. FIELD, because of unequal statin drop-in, gives little evidence on statin-fibrate combination therapy but does reinforce the available data on the safety of fenofibrate-statin combination therapy. In addition, fenofibrate showed possible benefits on microvascular disease end points, including albuminuria and retinopathy. On current data fenofibrate and gemfibrozil seem to be reasonable second-line agents in type 2 diabetes or secondary prevention with low HDL-C, respectively, based on outcome evidence. In combination therapy, drug-specific safety considerations will affect the exact choice of agent, especially in combination with statins, but the efficacy of combination therapy still requires validation in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study.",

Bowman- Birk inhibitor concentrate, budesonide, NCX-4016 and statins are all undergoing investigation in the clinical setting as potential chemopreventive agents for head and neck, lung, colon and breast cancers, respectively.", 
    "40": "Mortality rates in patients with schizophrenia are double compared with the general population, with cardiovascular disease causing 50% of the excess. Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is recognized as a primary target for the prevention of cardiovascular mortality. The effects of lipid-lowering treatment were evaluated in patients with schizophrenia. Forty-six patients with schizophrenia and with severe dyslipidaemia were identified. All were treated with antipsychotics. Patients were screened for cardiovascular risk factors and examined at baseline when statin therapy was initiated. The effects of lipid-lowering medication on lipid profile, glucose homeostasis and components of metabolic syndrome were evaluated at 3 months follow-up. After 3 months of statin therapy, a significant decrease in triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and, in associated ratios, low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein, cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein was observed. No significant changes occurred in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, waist circumference or glucose homeostasis. The only component of metabolic syndrome affected by statin therapy has been the serum triglyceride level. Statins proved effective in the management of dyslipidaemia in patients with schizophrenia treated with antipsychotics. More complex treatment may be required for associated metabolic disturbances.",

Among 74,102 subjects enrolled in 35 trials (follow-up range, 1 to 65 months), statin therapy (excluding cerivastatin) did not result in significant absolute increases in risks of myalgias (risk difference/1000 patients [RD], 2.7; 95% CI, -3.2 to 8.7), creatine kinase elevations (RD, 0.2; 95% CI, -0.6 to 0.9), rhabdomyolysis (RD, 0.4; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.9), or discontinuation due to any adverse event (RD, -0.5; 95% CI, -4.3 to 3.3).

    "51": "Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, and are used successfully in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Statins are contraindicated during pregnancy. Lately, we have shown that simvastatin has adverse affects on human first trimester placental explants' proliferation and migration. The objective of the present study was to investigate the molecules involved in mediating simvastatin's effect on trophoblast cell migration. We hypothesized that simvastatin attenuates insuline-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor expression (involved in trophoblast motility), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities, and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) levels (whose mRNA is actively transcribed during trophoblast differentiation) in trophoblast cells thus consequently effecting their migration.", 
    "52": "Human placental explants were cultured above a matrigel with/without simvastatin (10 microM) for 5 days. In this model, trophoblast migrates from the villi into the matrigel. Western-blot and immunohistochemistry served for analysing HSP27 expression. Immunohistochemistry was used for assessing IGF-I receptor localization. MMPs activity was assayed by gel zymography.", 
    "53": "Simvastatin reduced IGF-I receptor membranal expression, MMP2 activity and HSP27 expression in trophoblast cells (P < 0.05).", 
    "54": "The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on trophoblast cell migration is associated with a significant decrease in the tested molecules, which probably contributes to the impaired migration.", 
    "55": "Statins are effective drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Recent studies suggested that statins have additional beneficial effects on the vascular wall independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects. We investigated whether atorvastatin influences angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) production in differentiating human macrophages. Human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) were isolated from fresh buffy coats. The cells were allowed to differentiate for 0-8 days in macrophage serum-free medium with 5 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Atorvastatin (0.005-0.5 microM), mevalonate (200-400 microM), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (1.25-2.5 microM), and/or farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP; 1.25-2.5 microM) was added on the second day of differentiation and then every other day. After incubation time, the ACE amount in intact macrophages was measured. ACE amount in PBM was low. A marked time-dependent ACE induction was noticed during differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. Atorvastatin treatment inhibited ACE induction during differentiation. In the presence of mevalonate, atorvastatin failed to downregulate ACE production. Cotreatment of the cells with atorvastatin and FPP reversed the suppressive effect of atorvastatin on ACE. In conclusion, atorvastatin inhibited ACE upregulation, normally occurring in differentiating human macrophages. This effect was mediated via the mevalonate pathway, and inhibition of FPP was probably involved. The finding that atorvastatin inhibited ACE upregulation may represent a novel pleiotropic action and an additional beneficial effect of statins in treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

The subjects were randomly assigned to 3 parallel treatment groups: garlic powder (2.1 g/d), atorvastatin (40 mg/d), or placebo. Duplicate measurements were performed at baseline and after 1 and 3 mo of treatment. Treatments were compared with analysis of covariance with baseline as the covariate, and differences between the treatments were reported as mean percentage difference and corresponding 97.5% CI.",

    "61": "Statins are widely used clinical drugs that exert beneficial growth-suppressive effects in patients with cardiac hypertrophy. We investigated the role of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) (p21) in statin-dependent inhibition of hypertrophic growth in postmitotic cardiomyocytes. We demonstrate that lovastatin fails to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy to angiotensin II in p21(-/-) mice and that reconstitution of p21 function by TAT.p21 protein transduction can rescue statin action in these otherwise normally developed animals. Lovastatin specifically recruits the forkhead box FoxO3a transcription factor to the p21 promoter, mediating transcriptional transactivation of the p21 gene as analyzed in isolated primary cardiomyocytes. Lovastatin also stimulates protein kinase B/Akt kinase activity, and Akt-dependent phosphorylation forces p21 in the cytoplasm, where it inhibits Rho-kinases contributing to the suppression of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Loss of p21 or FoxO3a by RNA interference causes a general inhibition of lovastatin signal transduction. These results suggest that p21 functions as FoxO3a downstream target to mediate an statin-derived anti-hypertrophic response. Taken together, our genetic and biochemical data delineate an essential function of p21 for statin-dependent inhibition of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.",

This phase 1 study evaluated adding pravastatin (PV) (40-1680 mg/day, days 1-8) to idarubicin (Ida) ([12 mg/ (M2 x day), days 4-6]) + high-dose cytarabine (Ara-C; HDAC) [1.5 g/(M2 x day) by CI, days 4-7] in 15 newly diagnosed and 22 salvage patients with unfavorable (n = 26) or intermediate (n = 10) prognosis cytogenetics. Compared with historical experience with Ida-HDAC, the duration of neutropenia and throbmbocytopenia and the toxicity profile were unaffected by the addition of PV. During PV loading (day 0-4) serum triglyceride and total and LDL cholesterol levels decreased in nearly all patients. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated higher and more sustained serum PV levels with PV doses above 1280 mg/day. CR/CRp was obtained in 11 of 15 new patients, including 8 of 10 with unfavorable cytogenetics, and 9 of 22 salvage patients. An MTD for PV + Ida-HDAC was not reached. Addition of PV to Ida-HDAC was safe, and the encouraging response rates support conducting further trials evaluating the effect of cholesterol modulation on response in AML.",

In these patients, exposure to statins, both in terms of persistence and dose, was determined over the first two treatment years. To determine the risk for AMI, patients were followed from this 2-year time point until the first hospital admission for AMI, death, or end of the study period. A total of 31,557 patients (53%) discontinued statin use within 2 years; 20 883 patients (35%) were persistent users with an average equipotent dose>or=4.

Bcl-2 levels were significantly increased in brains of simvastatin-treated guinea pigs while levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax were significantly reduced. The ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, being a critical factor of the apoptotic state of cells, was significantly reduced in simvastatin-treated animals. Cholesterol levels in the brain remained unchanged in the simvastatin group. Brain cells isolated from simvastatin-treated guinea pigs were significantly less vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase-activation. These results provide new insight into potential mechanisms for the protective actions of statins within the CNS where programmed cell death has been implicated.",

DT104 internalization into epithelial monolayers increased steadily between 15 and 120min after apical inoculation. Internalization was reduced by the Rho GTPase inhibitor mevastatin, the N-WASP inhibitor wiskostatin and the actin-disrupting agent cytochalasin D, but not the Rac1 GTPase inhibitor NSC-23766. Early DT104 invasion of porcine enterocytes appears to be mediated by Rac1 GTPase-independent changes in epithelial actin assembly.",

Clopidogrel reduces early atherosclerosis, however, the role of clopidogrel in modulating inflammatory progression of atherosclerosis is less investigated. We wished to determine the effect of clopidogrel on progression of established atherosclerosis, vascular inflammatory factors and compared with that of aspirin and atorvastatin. Fifty male New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits were divided into five groups randomly including negative group. The rabbits were fed with a normal diet or a high cholesterol diet for 7 weeks. The right iliac artery of animals except negative group were balloon injured 1 week after initiation of the diet, then animals were treated with clopidogrel (4 mg/kg/day), aspirin (12 mg/kg/day), atorvastatin (2.5mg/kg/day) or placebo for 6 weeks. At the end of the study, the placebo (positive) group had significant progression of atherosclerosis compared with negative group. In contrast, clopidogrel, aspirin or atorvastatin treated rabbits showed a significant reduction in progression of atherosclerosis and decreased the levels of P-selection, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in serum and vascular wall. Among three drugs, the action of clopidogrel is the most powerful in decreasing the levels of inflammatory factors. These results suggest that in a rabbit atherosclerosis model, clopidogrel retards the progression of established lesions and that this effect is paralleled by a suppression of inflammatory factors.",

After 8 weeks, the TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and TG in the atorvastatin group decreased by 19%, 26%, and 17% respectively compared with the baseline values (all P < 0.05). Combination treatment decreased the TC, LDL-C, and TG levels by 28%, 38%, and 39% respectively, and increased the HDL-C level by 23% (all P < 0.05). The improvement in TC and LDL-C achieved by combination treatment was superior to treatment of atorvastatin alone and treatment of niacin ER alone (all P < 0.05). (2) The rate of achieving the LDL-C goal of The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) in the combination therapy group was 73.5%, significantly higher than those of the atorvastatin and niacin groups (47.7% and 42.1% respectively, both P < 0.05).

Although it triggers apoptosis in a great variety of eukaryotic cells, including many tumour cell lines, lovastatin failed to provoke apoptotic events in this human pathogen. The fungistatic behaviour of this statin might arise from its negative influence on membrane fluidity. Because yeast-->pseudomycelium and hyphae morphogenetic transitions took place under exposure to lovastatin morphogenetic switch and apoptotic cell death must be regulated independently in C. albicans.",

DILE has been accepted as a side effect of therapy with over 80 drugs since its first description in association with sulfadiazine in 1945. The epidemiology and clinical course of SLE and DILE differ markedly and prognosis is generally favourable in the latter although occasional life-threatening cases have been reported in the literature. Constant pharmacovigilance is crucial for prompt diagnosis and cessation of offending therapy offers the best outcome. This review discusses the clinical presentation, diagnosis of DILE as well as provides an update on postulated pathogenic mechanisms and an overview of implicated drugs.", 
    "79": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to improve the endothelial function by lowering lipids. Recent studies also suggest a direct impact of statins on the vascular wall. We assessed the rapid effect of cerivastatin on the coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE). The coronary flow velocity from the distal left anterior descending artery was measured in 16 healthy subjects (all male, age 24-38 years) using a 5-MHz transducer, on the day before, just before, and 3 h after administering 0.3 mg of cerivastatin. Hyperemia was achieved by the intravenous administration of adenosine, and the CFVR was calculated as the radio of the mean diastolic hyperemic coronary flow velocity to the basal flow velocity. The serum lipid profile and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were measured. The CFVR following the single administration of cerivastatin increased from 2.93+/-0.58 to 3.91+/-0.86, P=0.003, and was significantly higher than the CFVR measured at the same time on the previous day (3.91+/-0.86 vs 3.37+/-0.48, P=0.009). Neither the serum lipid profile nor hsCRP exhibited a remarkable change after cerivastatin administration. We concluded that a single-dose administration of cerivastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, improves the coronary flow velocity reserve without modifying the serum lipid profile.", 
    "80": "We investigated the effects of atorvastatin on inflammation and cardiac events during the inpatient period and initial 6-month follow-up in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with low low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level. One hundred and twelve consecutive ACS patients with LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg/dl were included in the study (mean 78.2+/-12.3 mg/dl). While 70 randomly selected patients received a dose of 40 mg atorvastatin within the first 24 h on top of their standard treatment as the atorvastatin group, the remaining 42 patients considered as the control group were given the standard treatment only, i.e., without any lipid-lowering drug therapy. Lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and plasma amyloid A (SAA) levels were measured in all patients within the first 24 h of chest pain, on the 5th day, and in the 6th month. During the inpatient period and subsequent 6-month follow-up, all episodes of angina, reinfarction, revascularization, heart failure, rehospitalization, cardiac mortality, and total number of cardiac events were recorded. In the atorvastatin group, hsCRP and SAA values on the 5th day and in the 6th month compared to the first 24 h were significantly lower than those of the control group (P<0.0001). Mean LDL cholesterol level was significantly decreased in the atorvastatin group (55.7+/-17.7 mg/dl), but there was no significant change in the control group at the 6th month. The frequency of heart failure during the inpatient period and angina, unstable angina pectoris, heart failure, and revascularization in the first 6 months were also significantly reduced in the atorvastatin group. Atorvastatin started in the first 24 h reduces inflammation and improves the prognosis during both the inpatient period and the first 6 months of clinical follow-up in ACS patients with low LDL cholesterol levels.", 
    "81": "Statins are lipid-lowering drugs widely used in the world. They are effective and safe in the treatment and in the primary and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. Besides they are known for their muscular side-effects. It has been suggested that they also have a toxic effect on the peripheral nervous system.", 
    "82": "Case reports and retrospective studies emphasize the possibility that statins can induce peripheral nerves side-effects. A single prospective study contradicts this hypothesis. Statins are hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA reductase) inhibitors, this action is responsible for the lipid-lowering effect but can also explain the nervous toxicity. Statins interfere with cholesterol synthesis that may alter myelin and nerve membrane function and they prevent mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme synthesis which may disturb neuron energy use.", 
    "83": "It can be considered that statins have an insignificant toxicity on peripheral nerves. The relevance of their prescription must be however well evaluated and treated patients must be closely followed.", 
    "84": "The National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III accepted the predominance of small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) as an emerging cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. Most studies suggest that measuring low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size, sdLDL cholesterol content and LDL particle number provides additional assessment of CVD risk. Therapeutic modulation of small LDL size, number and distribution may decrease CVD risk; however, no definitive causal relationship is established, probably due to the close association between sdLDL and triglycerides and other risk factors (e.g., high-density lipoprotein, insulin resistance and diabetes). This review addresses the formation and measurement of sdLDL, as well as the relationship between sdLDL particles and CVD. The effect of hypolipidaemic (statins, fibrates and ezetimibe) and hypoglycaemic (glitazones) agents on LDL size and distribution is also discussed.", 
    "85": "Signal detection is a crucial element in recognising new adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as soon as possible. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins'), the most potent cholesterol-lowering drugs, are generally well tolerated but can occasionally lead to liver toxicity. Pre- and postmarketing studies on statins revealed an incidence of 0.1-3% elevation in hepatic transaminase levels. However, these elevations are asymptomatic, reversible, dose related or probably due to other causes. Postmarketing studies clearly showed the lack of evidence of hepatotoxicity from statins, apart from some isolated case reports of serious hepatic damage described in the literature. It is still unclear whether serious hepatic reactions are dose related and more frequent than the expected rate in the general population.",

The GIF database holds reports of suspected ADRs submitted by five Italian pharmacovigilance regional centres. In the GIF database, all reports of suspected ADRs are classified according to the WHO criteria for causality assessment. The reactions are coded according to the WHO Adverse Reaction Terminology and classified as serious or non-serious events on the basis of the WHO Critical Term List. Every 6 months the GIF database is analysed to extract potential signals through a qualitative case-by-case analysis and using a quantitative methodology called proportional reporting ratio (PRR). This methodology permitted us to identify the potential signal 'fluvastatin and hepatic reactions'.", 
    "88": "At 31 December 2004, the GIF database contained 35 757 reports with an annual reporting rate of 170 reports per million inhabitants. We found a total of 1260 reports of ADRs related to statins, including 178 of hepatic reactions. Sixty-nine reports were attributed to fluvastatin, which showed the highest PRR in comparison with the other statins. Fluvastatin was associated with 33 serious reactions, mainly hepatitis and cholestatic hepatitis. The number of reports of severe hepatotoxicity associated with fluvastatin started to increase from 2002. About half of them did not report other suspected or concomitant drugs and in one third the hepatotoxicity occurred after <1 month of therapy. Twenty-seven out of 33 patients were female, and fluvastatin was administered at 80 mg/day in 81% of cases reporting complete data on drug dosage.", 
    "89": "In the literature, serious hepatic reactions are rarely described in patients taking statins; however, data gathered by GIF suggest that cases of hepatotoxicity are reported more often than expected. In addition, GIF data seem to reveal that fluvastatin is more likely to cause hepatic reactions than the other statins. However, this is a preliminary signal and future evaluations are certainly needed to confirm it and to quantify this possible risk.", 
    "90": "Many anecdotal reports have suggested that therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') can cause acute pancreatitis. We aimed to quantify the association between statins and pancreatitis and to classify the adverse effect under the dose, time, susceptibility (DoTS) system. We searched for controlled observational studies that assessed the risk of pancreatitis in patients receiving statins. In order to identify case reports of statin-induced pancreatitis, we looked for reports published in scientific journals and manually reviewed reports within the Canadian Adverse Drug Event Monitoring System (CADRMP) database. Two observational studies were identified and the data pooled together in a meta-analysis. This yielded an odds ratio of 1.41 (95% CI 1.15, 1.74) for the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with a past history of exposure to statins. We also identified 20 published case reports and 33 spontaneous reports from the CADRMP database. These data showed that pancreatitis can occur at both high and low doses, with 12 cases developing pancreatitis at less than the dose equivalent of simvastatin 20 mg daily. Statin-induced pancreatitis can occur at any time but seems to be very uncommon early on and more likely to occur after many months of therapy. There does not appear to be a cumulative dose effect and increasing age does not appear to be a major susceptibility factor. These finding should help clinicians to better manage and diagnose patients who are at risk of statin-induced pancreatitis.", 
    "91": "The aim of this study was to investigate the time course of C-reactive protein (CRP) reduction with simvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thirty-five subjects (mean +/- SEM body mass index 32.8 +/- 1 kg/m(2), mean +/- SEM glycated hemoglobin 7.3 +/- 0.2%) were studied using a randomized, crossover, double-blind design. Patients were treated with simvastatin 40 mg or placebo for 28 days, with a minimum 28-day intervening washout. On entry, all subjects had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >100 mg/dl and/or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol >130 mg/dl. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) was measured on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of each phase; fasting lipids were measured weekly. The mean hs-CRP level was 4.2 +/- 0.6 mg/L at baseline (>3.0 mg/L represents high risk). After simvastatin administration, there was a significant reduction in levels of log(hs-CRP) (p = 0.001). This effect of simvastatin was seen by day 7 (p = 0.008), with maximal reduction seen at day 14 (p = 0.004; hs-CRP in original units 3.1 +/- 0.5 mg/L with simvastatin and 4.1 +/- 0.6 mg/L with placebo). As expected, the change in hs-CRP was not related to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. By day 28 with simvastatin, hs-CRP had returned to near baseline levels. In conclusion, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, simvastatin reduced hs-CRP within 7 days. However, this potentially beneficial effect was lost within 28 days.", 
    "92": "After long-term therapy, some patients with systolic heart failure (HF) display improved left ventricular (LV) function over time, a response that is associated with improved long-term outcomes. To investigate predictors of improved LV function in an ethnically diverse HF cohort, we selected 71 patients with HF who had baseline ejection fractions (EF) <40%, follow-up EFs > or =50%, and >20% increases on follow-up echocardiography performed > or =6 months later. Their clinical features were compared with 142 age- and gender-matched control patients with baseline EFs <40% and no change or worse EFs on follow-up echocardiography. The baseline EFs were similar between patients and controls. Compared with controls, patients had a lower prevalence of diabetes mellitus (19.7% vs 36.6%, p = 0.01), a lower prevalence of an ischemic cause of disease (8.4% vs 35.2%, p <0.001), but a higher prevalence of a hypertensive cause of cardiomyopathy (29.6% vs 12%, p <0.001). Fewer patients than controls used aspirin (p = 0.04) or statins (p = 0.001) or had previous cardiac procedures (p = 0.009). In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, disease cause, statin use, cardiac procedures, change in heart rate, and follow-up time, hypertensive etiology was most strongly associated with improved LV function (adjusted odds ratio 9.73, 95% confidence interval 1.44 to 52.76, p = 0.02). In conclusion, patients with hypertensive causes of HF are more likely to demonstrate improved LV function over time than patients with ischemic causes of HF. Because long-term prognosis and indication for defibrillator implantation may be affected by changes in LV function, the present study provides additional support for the importance of evaluating the cause of HF to guide management.",

Patients were assigned to 10 mg atorvastatin as an initial dose every day. The atorvastatin dose was doubled every 6 weeks if the patients failed to reach the treatment target. After achieving LDL<100 mg/dl, the patients were assigned to the corresponding atorvastatin dose every other day for 12 weeks. Thirty-three patients correctly completed the study. LDL-C decreased 39% after the every-day period and 23% after the alternate-day atorvastatin dosing period (p<0.05). The target LDL-C concentration of <100 mg/dl was maintained in 19 patients (57.6%) in the alternate-day period.

Underlying neuromuscular diseases may become clinically apparent during statin therapy and may predispose to myotoxicity. The pathophysiology of myotoxicity most probably involves metabolic effects of the statins on the isoprenoid pool and on mitochondrial function.",

In order to further investigate if statins were promising candidates for the treatment for osteoporosis, we conducted a study in which rats were ovariectomized (OVX) at 6 months of age, allowed to lose bone for 60 days and followed by oral administration of simvastatin at the dose levels of 0.3-10 mg/kg/d for 60 days. PGE2 (6 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. Study endpoints included bone histomorphometry on the proximal tibial metaphysis (PTM) and the tibial diaphysis (TX), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry on the right femur and micro computed tomography (ICT) on the 5th lumbar vertebra (LV). After 120 days of OVX, cancellous bone lost by 80% in the PTM and 18% in the LV accompanied by increased bone formation and resorption. Simvastatin at all dose levels did not affect bone volume, bone formation rate and bone erosion surface when compared to 120 day ovariectomized animals at all bone sites studied. By contrast, PGE2 restored cancellous and cortical bone area to sham control levels. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that unlike PGE2, oral administration of simvastatin did not have effects on cancellous or cortical bone formation and resorption; and consequently was not able to prevent further bone loss or restore bone mass in the osteopenic, OVX rats.",

    "107": "This report provides the first evidence that human P450 4F2 (CYP4F2) is induced by statins, which are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Real time PCR and immunoblots indicate that lovastatin treatment increases expression of the endogenous CYP4F2 gene in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. The effects of lovastatin on gene expression are often mediated through sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Immunoblots indicate that lovastatin-treated human hepatocytes display increased proteolytic processing of SREBP-2. In HepG2 cells, co-administration of a potent suppressor of SREBP-2 activation, 25-hydroxycholesterol, inhibits CYP4F2 mRNA induction by lovastatin. HepG2 cells transfected with an expression vector for the active nuclear form of SREBP-1a (nSREBP-1a) also display elevated endogenous CYP4F2 expression. Luciferase reporters containing the CYP4F2 proximal promoter are transactivated by nSREBPs (-1a, -1c, and -2) or a dominant positive form of the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), which facilitates activation of endogenous SREBPs. Lovastatin-induced reporter expression is inhibited by overexpressed Insig-1, which prevents proteolytic activation of endogenous SREBPs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with in vitro translated nSREBP-1a identified two SREBP binding sites at -169/-152 and -109/-92, relative to the CYP4F2 transcription start site. Mutations in each site abolish SREBP binding. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that more SREBP-1 is associated with the CYP4F2 promoter after overexpression of nSREBP-1a. Transfection studies and mutagenesis indicate that the -109/-92 region is the primary site responsible for the effects of statins. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SREBPs transactivate CYP4F2 transcription and that CYP4F2 induction by statins is mediated by SREBP-2.",

Patients who had increased values on liver function tests, had been given a diagnosis of hypothyroidism or chronic renal failure, and who needed statin medication were excluded. Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the medication given; treatments consisted of Lipanthyl 1 x 1, Lipofentrade mark 1 x 1, Lopid 1 x 1, and Lopid 2 x 1. Biochemical and hematologic parameters of patients were recorded at the first visit and at the end of the 2-mo treatment period.

AgLDL increases Rho A translocation (2-fold) from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane in control but not in simvastatin-treated VSMC. Exoenzyme C3, a specific Rho A inhibitor, completely prevents agLDL-induced TF overexpression and partially agLDL-TF activation. Blocking LRP1, the receptor of agLDL, with anti-LRP1 antibodies or inhibiting LRP1 expression by small interference RNA treatment (siRNA-LRP1) impairs agLDL-induced TF overexpression and activation.",

Using high resolution ultrasound, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and nitroglycerin-induced dilation (NID) was assessed at baseline and after 4 years of treatment in a total of 276 subjects. At baseline, mean+/-standard error FMD was 4.73+/-0.49% and NID was 10.86+/-0.67%. Pravastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (p<0.01) and randomization to pravastatin was associated with a non-significant improvement of 18.9% in FMD (+0.80+/-0.95, p=0.09), without a significant change in NID. Interestingly, pravastatin significantly increased FMD by 34.9% in men (+1.23, p=0.04), but only 1.1% in women (+0.06, p=0.95). Fosinopril was not associated with a change in FMD or NID despite significantly decreasing urinary albumin excretion, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (all p<0.01). In conclusion, after 4 years of follow-up, pravastatin treatment tended to increase FMD and this effect was predominantly present in men. Fosinopril treatment did not modify FMD during long-term follow-up.",

The animals in the HC-ATOR group demonstrated increased myocardial expression of the antiangiogenic protein endostatin and increased Akt phosphorylation without significant changes in Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression.",

We determined the autoantibody titers against various forms of mildly oxLDL in patients with acute coronary syndromes without persistent elevation of the ST segment (NSTE-ACS) and with undetectable serum levels of lipoprotein (a). Moreover, the effect of early atorvastatin administration on these autoantibody titers was evaluated. From the 133 consecutive NSTE-ACS patients, 55 were eligible for the study. Thirty-four received atorvastatin (group A), whereas 21 did not received any hypolipidemic therapy (group B). Two forms of copper-oxidized LDL were prepared at the end of propagation or decomposition phase (oxLDL(P) or oxLDL(D), respectively). Similar types of oxLDL were prepared after previous inactivation of the endogenous Lp-PLA(2) [oxLDL(-)]. In group B, autoantibody titers of IgG class against oxLDL(P) and oxLDL(D) were elevated at 1 month of follow-up to reach the baseline values 3 months afterwards. By contrast the titers against oxLDL(-)(P) and oxLDL(-)(D) increased at 1 month of follow-up and remained elevated for up to 6 months of follow-up. Atorvastatin treatment prevented the elevation of autoantibody titers against all forms of oxidized LDL. We conclude that a short-term immune response against oxLDL(P) and oxLDL(D) (enriched in lyso-PC) and a chronic immune response against oxLDL(-)(P) and oxLDL(-)(D) (enriched in oxPL) are observed after an NSTE-ACS, suggesting an important role of the LDL-associated Lp-PLA(2) in modulating these immune responses. Early atorvastatin treatment prevents both immune responses; however, the clinical significance of this effect remains to be established.",

PCSK9 and NPC1L1 genes were analysed to assess the role of genetic variants in response to therapy. In FH patients combined therapy reduced LDL-C by 57%, irrespective of the type of LDLR mutation. The additional decrease of plasma LDL-C induced by ezetimibe showed wide inter-individual variability (from -39% to -4.7%) and was negatively correlated with percent LDL-C decrease due to statin alone (r=-0.713, P<0.001). The variable response to statins was not due to PCSK9 gene variants associated with statin hyper-sensitivity. The highest response to ezetimibe was observed in a carrier of R174H substitution in NPC1L1, which had been found to be associated with high cholesterol absorption. In HCH patients, ezetimibe monotherapy induced a variable decrease of plasma LDL-C (from -47.7% to -13.4%). To investigate this variability, we sequenced NPC1L1 gene in patients with the highest and the lowest response to ezetimibe. This analysis showed a higher prevalence of the G allele of the c.816 C>G polymorphism (L272L) in hyper-responders, an observation confirmed also in FH patients hyper-responders to ezetimibe. In both FH and HCH patients, the G allele carriers tended to have a higher LDL-C reduction in response to ezetimibe. These observations suggest that in FH heterozygotes LDL-C reduction following combined therapy reflects a complex interplay between hepatic synthesis and intestinal absorption of cholesterol.", 
    "129": "Lymphocyte homing to peripheral lymph nodes is governed by adhesion molecules, including lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1). Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors and exert anti-inflammatory effects, e.g. inhibition of LFA-1. It is still not known whether statin compounds are capable of inhibiting lymphocyte homing in vivo. We used a cervical lymph node preparation to study the effects of simvastatin on lymphocyte adhesion to high endothelial venules (HEVs) by means of intravital fluorescence microscopy (IVM). IVM revealed that firm adhesion of lymphocytes to HEV endothelium critically depends on the adhesive function of LFA-1. The number of firmly adherent lymphocytes was reduced by 58% in LFA-1-deficient mice (P < 0.05 versus wild-type controls). As in mutant mice, acute treatment with simvastatin (i.p. injection at 2 hr prior to IVM) inhibited the firm adhesion of lymphocytes to HEV endothelium of wild-type animals by 63% (P < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated wild-type controls). In addition, acute treatment with the synthetic statin-derivate LFA878 also reduced firm lymphocyte adhesion in HEVs by 63% (P > 0.05 versus placebo-treated controls). Histological analysis after a 10-day treatment with simvastatin showed reduced cellularity of cervical lymph nodes, as indicated by a reduction of the relative area of haematoxylin-stained cell nuclei in cervical lymph node cross-sections from 94 +/- 0% in vehicle-treated controls to 77 +/- 3% in simvastatin-treated mice (P < 0.05). We conclude that statin compounds are capable of inhibiting lymphocyte homing to murine peripheral lymph nodes in vivo. This may have novel implications for the treatment of adaptive immune responses, e.g. transplant rejection.",

Within the cohort of 71 hypercholesterolemic patients, there was a significant correlation between cholesterol levels, 3-NT and aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), that is a reliable measure of aortic stiffness. Among those patients who received rosuvastatin, significant reductions in plasma cholesterol, 3-NT and aPWV were observed. Reductions in both aPWV and 3-NT levels correlated significantly with the decrease in plasma cholesterol. Reduction of plasma cholesterol was the only independent predictor for reduced arterial stiffness following rosuvastatin therapy.", 
    "134": "Cholesterol reduction achieved following short-term rosuvastatin therapy is associated with a decrease in peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative stress and an improvement in large artery distensibility; reduction in arterial stiffness is directly attributable to rosuvastatin-induced cholesterol lowering and not to reduction of plasma 3-NT levels.",

Although LDL cholesterol reduction is the first step in reducing cardiovascular risk, it may be difficult for clinicians to visualize the risk reduction benefit for patients from various risk interventions. The concept of a \"risk curve,\" or the absolute risk of a patient for subsequent cardiovascular events over a range of LDL cholesterol values, is proposed. In conclusion, placing a patient on the appropriate risk curve may facilitate an individualized clinical management strategy that takes into account the patient's absolute benefit from further LDL cholesterol reduction as well as from shifting the risk curve downward through non-LDL cholesterol interventions.",

Among acute ischemic stroke patients, 62 patients (76%) had mild neurological symptoms of NIH Stroke Scale score < or = 4 on admission. As the initial treatment during the acute phase, all patients underwent antithrombotic medication; 33 of them underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid arterial stenting (CAS) in the chronic stage. Of 211 chronic patients, 123 (58%) did not have a history of symptomatic ischemic stroke, and instead had nonspecific symptoms, including carotid bruit, headache, and vertigo, or were diagnosed as having carotid artery stenosis by examinations of preoperative screenings. One hundred and thirty-five chronic patients underwent CEA/CAS and all the others except for a patient with serious gastrointestinal bleeding underwent anti-thrombotic medication. Statin treatment was chosen for 59 acute patients and 66 chronic patients. Because many patients with carotid arterial stenosis had mild symptoms during the acute phase or did not have ischemic episodes, we might overlook carotid lesions unless we performed screening examinations using ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiography.",

The most frequent causative drugs were amoxicillin-clavulanate (4 of 69 cases), bentazepam (3 of 7 cases), atorvastatin (2 of 7 cases), and captopril (2 of 5 cases). Patients with cholestatic/mixed injury (18 of 194 cases [9%]) were more prone to chronicity than patients with hepatocellular injury (10 of 240 cases; P < .031). In the case of chronic hepatocellular injury, 3 patients progressed to cirrhosis and 2 to chronic hepatitis. In the cholestatic/mixed group, liver biopsy indicated cirrhosis in 1 patient and ductal lesions in 3 patients. In conclusion, cholestatic/mixed type of damage is more prone to become chronic while, in the hepatocellular pattern, the severity is greater. Cardiovascular and central nervous system drugs are the main groups leading to chronic liver damage.", 
    "143": "The first reports of neuropathy due to treatment with statins appeared in 1994, although it is an infrequent complication. It usually consists of an axonal polyneuropathy, which is predominantly sensory, distal and symmetric, and may be subacute or chronic. We present here the second case reported in the literature of multiple mononeuropathy associated to the use of statins.", 
    "144": "A 51-year-old female patient who, after beginning therapy with pravastatin, presented with progressive, asymmetrically distributed, distal paresthesias in the limbs and an unstable gait. An electromyographic study was compatible with multiple mononeuritis. Results of complementary tests that were carried out to preclude other causes of multiple mononeuropathy were normal. The patient's condition improved on withdrawing treatment with the drug and it became worse again when therapy was restarted. When pravastatin therapy was stopped for good, the patient's condition progressively improved until she was practically free of symptoms.", 
    "145": "The relationship between treatment with statins and the appearance of polyneuropathy has been proved in different epidemiological case-control studies. It does not only appear as the classical distal symmetrical polyneuropathy, but has also been reported as taking on atypical clinical forms including a few cases, like ours, of multiple mononeuropathy. The risk of developing this complication is low and is offset by the cardiovascular benefits offered by statins, although it may become more common in the future due to the increasing rate of use of these agents. It is important to bear this cause of neuropathy in mind, given the fact that it is potentially reversible.",

Pretreatment with atorvastatin was associated with 49% higher nitrite/nitrate levels compared with controls (p < .05). In study 1, whereas APE increased mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) by 13.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg in perfused lungs isolated from rats pretreated with water, pretreatment with atorvastatin attenuated by 27% the increases in MPAP after APE. In study 2, pretreatment with atorvastatin was associated with a significant increase in 24-hr survival rate after APE, which was 48% in embolized rats pretreated with water and 64% in rats pretreated with atorvastatin (p < .05). Gelatin zymography of lung and plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 was performed. Lungs and plasma from embolized rats showed higher levels of both pro- and activated forms of MMP-9 compared with those from nonembolized animals (all p < .05). However, pretreatment with atorvastatin attenuated by 32% the increases in lung-activated MMP-9 levels after APE (p < .05).",

    "158": "Despite myriad advances, cardiovascular-related diseases continue to remain our greatest health problem. In more than half of patients with atherosclerotic disease, their first presentation to medical attention becomes their last. Patients often survive their first cardiac event through acute revascularization and placement of drug-eluting stents (DES), but only select coronary lesions are amenable to DES placement, resulting in the use of bare metal or no stent, both of which lack the benefit of antirestenotic therapy. In other patients, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and stroke constitute the initial presentation of disease. In these patients, the diagnostic and therapeutic options are woefully inadequate. Nanomedicine offers options to each of these challenges. Antiangiogenic paramagnetic nanoparticles may be used to serially assess the severity of atherosclerotic disease in asymptomatic, high-risk patients by detecting the development of plaque neovasculature, which reflects the underlying lesion activity and vulnerability to rupture. The nanoparticles can locally deliver antiangiogenic therapy, which may acutely retard plaque progression, allowing aggressive statin therapy to become effective. Moreover, these agents may be useful as a quantitative marker to guide atherosclerotic management in an asymptomatic patient. In those cases proceeding to the catheterization laboratory for revascularization, nanoparticles incorporating antirestenotic drugs can be delivered directly into the wall of lesions not amenable to DES placement. Targeted nanoparticles could help ensure that antirestenotic drugs are available for all lesions. Moreover, displacement of antiproliferative agents from the intimal surface into the vascular wall is likely to improve rehealing of the endothelium, improving postprocedural management of these patients.",

    "172": "Statins, the widely used lipid-lowering drugs, are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyses a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Many previous reports show that statins can act both as bone anabolic and as anti-resorptive agents but their beneficial effects on bone turnover are still controversial. Considering their high liver specificity and low oral bioavailability, the distribution of statins to the bone microenvironment is questionable. In this study, the distribution of lovastatin and its active metabolites to bone, with respect to plasma and liver compartments, was examined after oral and intravenous administration in female rats. As compared with oral administration, the distribution of lovastatin to the bone compartment was significantly enhanced after intravenous administration. Further, the effect of lovastatin on bone turnover was studied in-vitro and in-vivo to assess its anti-osteoporotic potential. Lovastatin acid but not lovastatin was found to inhibit parathyroid-hormone-induced bone resorption in an in-vitro chick embryo bone assay. Oral, as well as intravenous, short-term lovastatin treatment significantly reduced the serum total cholesterol, serum total alkaline phosphatase and urinary crosslinks in ovariectomized rats. In accordance with its increased distribution to the bone compartment, intravenously administered lovastatin was more effective in reducing the ovariectomy-induced increase in markers of bone metabolism, especially urinary crosslinks. The findings of this study suggest that statins inhibit bone resorption and that their anti-resorptive efficacy can be increased by administering them by routes other than oral so as to achieve their enhanced concentration in bone.", 
    "173": "We conducted a systematic review of the association between HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) use and cancer risk. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, ISI Proceedings and BIOSIS Previews bibliographic databases, electronic trials registers and reference lists for potentially eligible randomized trials and observational studies. Thirty-eight individual studies (26 randomized trials involving 103,573 participants and 12 observational studies with 826,854 participants) were included. Median follow-up was 3.6 and 6.2 years for trials and observational studies, respectively. In metaanalyses of randomized trials, there was no evidence that statin therapy was associated with incidence of all-cancers (26 trials; pooled risk ratio = 1.00; 95% CI 0.95-1.05; I(2) = 0%) or the following site-specific cancers: breast (7 trials; risk ratio = 1.01; 0.79-1.30; I(2) = 43%), prostate (4 trials; risk ratio = 1.00; 0.85-1.17; I(2) = 0%), colorectum (9 trials; risk ratio = 1.02; 0.89-1.16; I(2) = 0%), lung (9 trials; risk ratio = 0.96; 0.84-1.09; I(2) = 0%), genito-urinary (5 trials; risk ratio = 0.95; 0.83-1.09; I(2) = 0%), melanoma (4 trials; risk ratio = 0.86; 0.62-1.20; I(2) = 17%) or gastric (1 trial; risk ratio = 1.00; 0.35-2.85). There was no evidence of differential effects by length of follow-up, statin type (lipophilic vs. lipophobic) or potency. Trial results were generally consistent with observational studies. We conclude that statin use is not associated with short-term cancer risk, but longer-latency effects remain possible.",

    "179": "The combination of ezetimibe, an inhibitor of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1), and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor decreases cholesterol absorption and synthesis. In clinical trials, ezetimibe plus simvastatin produces greater LDL-cholesterol reductions than does monotherapy. The molecular mechanism for this enhanced efficacy has not been defined. Apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) kinetics were determined in miniature pigs treated with ezetimibe (0.1 mg/kg/day), ezetimibe plus simvastatin (10 mg/kg/day), or placebo (n = 7/group). Ezetimibe decreased cholesterol absorption (-79%) and plasma phytosterols (-91%), which were not affected further by simvastatin. Ezetimibe increased plasma lathosterol (+65%), which was prevented by addition of simvastatin. The combination decreased total cholesterol (-35%) and LDL-cholesterol (-47%). VLDL apoB pool size decreased 26%, due to a 35% decrease in VLDL apoB production. LDL apoB pool size decreased 34% due to an 81% increase in the fractional catabolic rate, both of which were significantly greater than monotherapy. Combination treatment decreased hepatic microsomal cholesterol (-29%) and cholesteryl ester (-65%) and increased LDL receptor (LDLR) expression by 240%. The combination increased NPC1L1 expression in liver and intestine, consistent with increased SREBP2 expression. Ezetimibe plus simvastatin decreases VLDL and LDL apoB-100 concentrations through reduced VLDL production and upregulation of LDLR-mediated LDL clearance.", 
    "180": "Although substantial evidence suggests that treatment of dyslipidemia with statins reduces mortality and morbidity that are associated with cardiovascular disease, only a few studies have examined the efficacy of statins on inflammatory and fibrinolytic status in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A 6-mo, prospective, randomized study was designed to assess the efficacy of atorvastatin in reducing circulating inflammatory and fibrinolytic parameters in patients with CKD. Sixty-six patients with CKD (stages 2, 3, and 4) and LDL cholesterol levels > or =100 mg/dl were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive 20 mg/d atorvastatin (n = 44) or nonatorvastatin therapy (n = 22). Lipid profile, renal function, fibrinolytic balance (tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA] and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP], IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) were measured before and 6 mo after atorvastatin was added to the treatment. Twenty-five age-matched individuals with normal renal function (estimated GFR >90 ml/min) were used as healthy control subjects. Patients with CKD had higher CRP, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 levels than age-matched population with normal renal function. t-PA concentration was higher in patients with CKD (P = 0.000). Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 values were comparable in all patients. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly reduced only in patients who received atorvastatin. In addition to the hypolipidemic effect, atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced inflammatory parameters: CRP (median 4.1 to 2.9; P = 0.015), TNF-alpha (6.0 +/- 2.7 to 4.7 +/- 2.4; P = 0.046), and IL-1 beta levels (1.9 +/- 0.7 to 1.2 +/- 0.7; P = 0.001). These parameters remained unchanged in patients who were not treated with atorvastatin. Fibrinolytic parameters were not modified by atorvastatin treatment. Patients with CKD showed higher levels of inflammatory parameters and t-PA levels than age-matched healthy control subjects. Atorvastatin treatment, in addition to its beneficial effect on cholesterol levels, improved the inflammatory state of these patients without modifying fibrinolytic balance.", 
    "181": "It has been known for a long time that chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with dyslipidemia, but the full extent of abnormalities has been appreciated only recently, because routine laboratory tests fail to disclose the entire spectrum of lipid abnormalities. Lipids, particularly HDL cholesterol, are predictive of cardiovascular events, but a paradoxic inverse relation between cholesterol concentration and cardiovascular death has been noted in uremic patients. This currently is thought to be explained by the confounding effect of microinflammation and possibly calcification, but this is not definitely proved. Several retrospective analyses that included patients with mild or moderate CKD documented benefit from lowering of cholesterol by statins. In contrast, the Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse (4D) study and a small Scandinavian study failed to show a benefit from lowering of cholesterol by statins in ESRD. Pathomechanistically, it is possible that nonclassical pathomechanisms override statin-sensitive mechanisms as also suggested by the observation that statins fail to reduce carotid intima-media thickening. Although, experimentally, exposure to lipids (particularly oxidized lipids) aggravates progression, data on the effect of statins on progression in patients with CKD are not definite. The most likely explanation is that the impact of numerous confounders obscures their effect on progression. The increase in urinary protein excretion of patients who are treated with statins had been a cause of concern, but the underlying mechanism (i.e. interference with proximal tubular reabsorption of protein) meanwhile has been well documented."
