In view of this, we have evaluated the lipid-lowering effect of a nutraceutical pill containing berberine (BBR) and of ezetimibe, as alternative treatments, in monotherapy or in combination, in 228 subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia (HCH), with history of STs intolerance or refusing STs treatment. In addition, since PCSK9 was found up-regulated by STs dampening their effect through an LDL receptors (LDLRs) degradation, and BBR suppressed PCSK9 expression in cellular studies, we supplemented the stable lipid-lowering therapy of 30 genotype-confirmed Familial Hypercholesterolemia heterozygotes (HeFH) with BBR, searching for a further plasma cholesterol reduction. Plasma lipid pattern was evaluated at baseline and during treatments.", 
    "1": "In HCH subjects the nutraceutical pill resulted more effective than EZE in lowering LDL cholesterol (-31.7% vs -25.4%, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and better tolerated. On treatment, LDL-C level below 3.36\u2009mmol/L (\u2264130 mg/dl) was observed in 28.9% of subjects treated with the nutraceutical pill and 11.8% of those treated with EZE (P <0.007). In the group treated with EZE the subjects carrying the G allele of the g.1679 C > G silent polymorphism of NPC1L1 gene showed a higher response to EZE than homozygous for the common allele (GG + CG: LDL-C -29.4\u00b15.0%, CC -23.6\u00b16.5%, P <0.001). Combined treatment with these drugs was as effective as STs in moderate doses (LDL cholesterol -37%, triglycerides -23%). In HeFH patients the addition of BBR resulted in LDL cholesterol reductions inversely related to those induced by the stable therapy (r\u2009=\u2009-0.617, P <0.0001), with mean 10.5% further decrease.", 
    "2": "The alternative treatments tested in our HCH subjects were rather effective and safe. The findings in HeFH patients suggest that BBR might act in vivo increasing expression and stability of LDLRs and/or suppressing PCSK9 expression.", 
    "3": "Dyslipidemia is one of the most modifiable risk factors in preventing heart disease. Evidence demonstrates that the process of atherosclerosis, a result of dyslipidemia, begins in young adults. Initiating statin therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality. Determining the right statin medication and dose for an older adult based on national guidelines can be challenging, as multiple factors must be considered in this decision. When initiating statin therapy, clinicians should determine the appropriate percentage of reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol needed to achieve the target goal. Additionally, when changing from one cholesterol-lowering medication to another, knowledge of equivalent dosing is important. Generally, statin drugs are well tolerated with a good safety profile in older adults but are underused in this patient population. Issues such as existing comorbid conditions, polypharmacy with the potential for drug-drug interactions, impaired drug metabolism, and decreased functional status can contribute to adverse events and increase the frequency of myalgias and less frequently, hepatotoxicity. Clinicians prescribing statin therapy for older adults need to remain current on advances in research regarding potential interactions and contraindications within this drug class.", 
    "4": "The aim of this work was to study the influence of atorvastatin, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on microrheologic properties of erythrocytes in patients with arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia. 33 patients (mean age 52.8+-1.7 years) having grade I-II AH with type IIb dyslipidemia, risk 3 (DAGZ criteria. 2008) were compared with 26 age-matched healthy subjects. Atorvastatin therapy optimized blood lipid spectrum, lipid peroxidation, and lipid composition of erythrocyte membranes within 16 weeks after the onset. It decreased activated lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes due to enhanced antioxidant protection. The blood diskocyte level was normalized within 16 weeks of therapy. Simultaneously, the total number of reversibly and irreversibly altered erythrocytes decreased to the stable normal level. The total number and size of erythrocytes in an aggregate were also close to those in healthy subjects while the amount of unbound cells increased.", 
    "5": "The effect of the initial pH value of the cultivation medium on lovastatin (mevinolinic acid) biosynthesis by Aspergillus terreus ATCC20542 was studied. It was found that if the pH value of the broth is acidic, the direct chromatographic assay of mevinolinic acid leads to the underestimated values. Thus, the equilibrium curve was determined for the transformation of \u03b2-hydroxy acid form of lovastatin (mevinolinic acid) into lovastatin lactone. The calculation of the equilibrium constant shows that when the pH value of the solution is 4.98, concentrations of both forms of lovastatin are equal to each other. This finding was next used to study mevinolinic acid formation at the various initial pH values of the medium. It occurs that even at pH lower than 5.5 mevinolinic acid is still, although inefficiently, produced and its presence remains unnoticed, unless the samples of the broth are alkalised prior to the assay. Mevinolinic acid is efficiently produced at the initial pH value of the medium equal to 7.5 and 8.5 and it correlates with the rapid utilisation of lactose by A. terreus. Additionally, other secondary metabolites were sought at the various initial pH values of the medium with the use of mass spectrometry. (+)-Geodin is only formed at pH 6.5, while monacolin L is found at the highest amount at pH 7.5.",

Chronic myocardial ischemia was induced by ameroid constrictor placement around the circumflex artery. After 6 months of the diet, myocardial perfusion was measured at rest and with demand pacing. The heart was harvested for analysis of perfusion, microvessel relaxation, protein expression, and oxidative stress.", 
    "8": "Both groups had similar endothelium-dependent microvessel relaxation to adenosine diphosphate and endothelium-independent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside. Myocardial perfusion in the ischemic territory was also not significantly different either at rest or with demand pacing. Atorvastatin treatment increased total myocardial protein oxidation and serum lipid peroxidation. However, the expression of markers of oxidative stress, including NOX2, RAC1, myeloperoxidase, and superoxide dismutase 1, 2, and 3, were not statistically different. The expression of proangiogenic proteins endothelial nitric oxide synthase, phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (Ser 1177), phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate kinase (Thr 172), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (T202, Y204), and vascular endothelial growth factor were all upregulated in the atorvastatin group.", 
    "9": "Atorvastatin increased the capillary and arteriolar density and upregulated the proangiogenic proteins endothelial nitric oxide synthase and phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase, phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate kinase, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor in a swine model of the metabolic syndrome. However, it failed to increase myocardial perfusion. Atorvastatin treatment was associated with increased myocardial and serum oxidative stress, which might contribute to the lack of collateral-dependent perfusion in the setting of angiogenesis.",

Statins enhance endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression, thereby attenuating platelet activation and thrombus formation. Our goal was to determine whether statins have eNOS-independent effects on platelet activation.", 
    "11": "Wild-type and eNOS-deficient mice were given a 14-day course of oral atorvastatin, and platelet activation was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Whereas in wild-type mice atorvastatin inhibited platelet activation in vitro in response to numerous agonists, in eNOS-deficient mice, atorvastatin inhibited only thrombin-induced and protease-activated receptor 4 agonist peptide-induced platelet activation. Consistent with an eNOS-independent effect, atorvastatin inhibited platelet activation in vivo in both wild-type and eNOS-deficient mice.",

    "13": "The endothelial response elicited by the G-protein-coupled receptor pathway involving apelin and APJ predicts an overall vasoprotective effect. As a number of downstream endothelial targets of apelin/APJ signaling are also known to be targeted by statins (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitors) as potential mediators of their known pleiotropic effects, we evaluated for the involvement of apelin/APJ signaling in statin endothelial effects.", 
    "14": "We found that disruption of apelin/APJ signaling in endothelial cells leads to significantly decreased expression of Kr\u0171ppel-like factor 2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and thrombomodulin. We found that statin-mediated induction of Kr\u0171ppel-like factor 2, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and thrombomodulin expression, as well as inhibition of monocyte-endothelial adhesion, was abrogated by concurrent apelin knockdown. Moreover, we found that statins can transcriptionally regulate APJ in a Kr\u0171ppel-like factor 2-dependent manner, demonstrating the presence of a positive-feedback loop.", 
    "15": "Our findings provide a novel mechanism by which the apelin/APJ pathway serves as a critical intermediary that links statin to its pleiotropic effects in regulating endothelial gene targets and function.", 
    "16": "Sepsis and its sequelae of multiple organ failure is one of the leading causes of death in the industrial countries. Several studies have shown that patients who are treated with low-dose acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) for secondary prevention of atherothrombosis may have a lower risk to develop organ failure in the case of critical illness. The benefit of ASA is probably due to an inhibition of platelet activation as well as an increase in the formation of anti-inflammatory lipoxin A4. On the other hand, the effect of ASA could be - at least partially - an indirect one, caused by atherosclerotic vascular diseases as the cause of ASA treatment. Atherosclerosis is considered as a moderate systemic inflammation and we hypothesise that this chronic condition could have an impact on the outcome in sepsis. To get more information on the benefit of ASA in critically ill patients and on possible interference with atherosclerotic vascular diseases, we analysed the medical records of 886 septic patients who were admitted to the surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. Logistic regression analysis indicated that patients who were treated during the ICU stay with ASA (100\u2009mg/d) had a significantly lower mortality. Odds ratios (ORs; with 95% confidential intervals) of 0.56 (0.37-0.84) and 0.57 (0.39-0.83) were calculated for ICU and hospital mortality, respectively. In contrast, statin treatment did not have significant effect on mortality. Diagnosis of atherosclerotic vascular diseases according to ICD classification did not influence ICU mortality but lowered hospital mortality (OR\u2009=\u20090.71 (0.52-0.99)). Subgroup analysis provided preliminary evidence that clopidogrel when given as only anti-platelet drug may have a similar benefit as ASA, but the combination of ASA and clopidogrel failed to improve the outcome. The time course of plasma fibrinogen and procalcitonin levels indicate that ASA seems to reduce the activation of haemostasis and increase the resolution of inflammation. It is concluded that prospective interventional studies should be done to test the use of ASA as novel therapeutic approach in critically ill patients.", 
    "17": "Current hypertension management guidelines do not recommend drug treatment in subjects with blood pressure (BP) in the high-normal range due to the risk of side effects of the currently available antihypertensive agents that overcomes the possible benefit. Nutraceuticals are free from relevant side effects and could be a valuable strategy for the treatment of these patients.", 
    "18": "The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of two nutraceutical compositions given by the combination of policosanol, red yeast rice extract, berberine, folic acid and coenzyme Q(10) with or without Orthosiphon stamineus in lowering the BP and lipid profile.", 
    "19": "Thirty patients with grade 1 essential hypertension and low cardiovascular risk were analysed. At the end of a run-in period, patients were divided into two study arms and assigned to receive the nutraceutical combination with and without Orthosiphon stamineus. All participants underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring at the end of the run-in period and of the 4-week treatment with each of the two different nutraceutical combinations.", 
    "20": "In patients treated with Orthosiphon stamineus a significant reduction of mean 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP levels compared with baseline values was registered and the smoothness index calculated for systolic and diastolic BP showed a more reliable and homogeneous effect on BP over 24 hours. In contrast, nutraceutical treatment without Orthosiphon stamineus was not associated with a significant reduction of BP.",

Laboratory data on admission revealed proteinuria (3.4 g/day), microscopic hematuria (3+), and renal dysfunction (serum creatinine 1.47 mg/dL). In the renal biopsy, all glomeruli showed mild mesangial proliferation. A few glomeruli showed mild segmental endocapillary proliferation. Crescent was not found in any glomeruli. Immunofluorescent study revealed the deposition of IgA and C3 in the mesangial area. In addition, jagged-edged angular cholesterol clefts of atheromatous emboli were seen in a small artery with tubular atrophy and fibrosis. He was diagnosed as Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis accompanied by idiopathic cholesterol crystal embolism, because he previously had not undergone any cardiac procedures (e. g., percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting) and anticoagulating therapy. Oral prednisolone (40 mg/day) effectively decreased proteinuria and improved his renal dysfunction. In this case, renal dysfunction may be related to the ischemic interstitial damage caused by cholesterol crystal embolism, as well as purpura nephritis.",

However, its effect on atherosclerosis plaque progression is certainly unknown. MicroRNAs are short non-encoding RNA molecules dynamically implicated in monocytic differentiation which is considered an essential process during atherosclerosis development. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ezetimibe on monocyte/macrophage differentiation as well as the implication of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process. THP-1 differentiation with PMA became cells adherent to the plastic surface, and induced the expression of macrophage surface markers (CD11a, CD11b and ICAM-1) and miR-155, miR-222, miR-424 and miR-503. In the presence of ezetimibe, the adhesive capacity of THP-1 cells was decreased in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05) and the expression of CD11a, CD11b and ICAM-1 was almost totally inhibited (P<0.05). The expression of miR-155, miR-222, miR-424 and miR-503 was reduced by 55%, 100%, 75% and 100%, respectively (P<0.05). Further mechanistic studies demonstrated that ezetimibe suppressed the PMA-induced phosphorylation of ERK/MAPK and inhibited the NF-\u03baB activity, which are upstream signalling molecules in the differentiation process. In conclusion, ezetimibe inhibits PMA-induced THP-1 cell differentiation into macrophage-like cells in association with the inhibition of miRNA pathways. Our study suggests that inhibition of miRNAs might form a novel mechanism of anti-atherosclerotic effect of ezetimibe.",

To evaluate possible nontraditional effects of treatment with Atrovastatin on PMNL priming, oxidative stress and inflammation in hyperlipidemia, 50 non-smoking hyperlipidemic patients were treated for 6 months with Atrovastatin and compared to age and gender-matched healthy controls. PMNL priming was assessed by the rate of superoxide release from separated, phorbol ester-stimulated PMNL and by PMNL-CD11b levels. Inflammation was reflected by blood inflammatory markers including albumin, transferrin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen levels, white blood cells (WBC), PMNL counts and PMNL apoptosis. Atrovastatin treatment showed a reduction in PMNL priming, PMNL apoptosis, fibrinogen and CRP levels concomitant with decreased lipid levels.

We conducted a case-control study examining aspirin and statin use in patients with EAC. Cancer cases were compared against age-sex-matched controls attending for diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Risk factor and drug exposure were established using standardized interviews. Logistic regression was used to compare statin exposure and correct for confounding factors. A total of 112 cases and 448 controls were enrolled.

Aspirin use was also associated with apparent protection against EAC (odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.28-0.92), and a significantly greater effect was seen with the combination of statin plus aspirin (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.05-0.67). There was a significant trend for greater risk reduction with longer duration and higher doses of statin use. Simvastatin comprised the majority of statin use, but similar effects were seen with simvastatin and non-simvastatin agents. In this observational study, patients regularly using statins or aspirin had a lower incidence of EAC. Statins may have clinically useful effects in preventing the development of EAC.",

The aim of this combined in vitro and in vivo study was to investigate the influence of the commonly used simvastatin on prostacyclin and thromboxane A2, 2 prostaglandins with different cardiovascular effects, normally in homeostatic balance in the circulatory system. Single-dose administration of simvastatin significantly decreased urinary prostacyclin excretion of healthy volunteers (P < 0.01) and increased the ratio between thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin (2-fold increase, P < 0.01), as assessed by enzyme immunoassays of the corresponding metabolites in urine. Human vascular endothelial cells, exposed to corresponding concentrations of simvastatin and assayed in the same way, reduced the release of prostacyclin about 40% (P < 0.05), altered the transcriptional expression of cyclooxygenase and prostacyclin synthase as analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and reduced the prostacyclin synthase promoter activity by 50% (P < 0.05), evaluated in a luciferase reporter system. We speculate that simvastatin shifts the balance between thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin in favor of the thromboxane pathway in vivo, and after exposure to clinically relevant concentrations in vitro. This may have pathophysiological implications by promoting a prothrombotic state in the blood vessels.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the possible toxic or activating effects of iodixanol on endothelial cells (EC) and the putative in vitro protective action of N-acetylcysteine and rosuvastatin. Morphology, oxidative status, redistribution of heat-shock protein 60 and secretion of proinflammatory products were studied in cultured human EC through confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence and immuno-enzymatic methods. EC reacted to iodixanol with shrinking and bulging, increase in intracellular oxidation and translocation of Heat Shock Protein 60 to the cell membrane. The secretion of proinflammatory products was strongly stimulated by sequential incubation of EC with iodixanol and TNF\u03b1 (p<0.00001 for all tested molecules, namely TNF\u03b1, IL-8, sVCAM-1, MCP-1, and IL-6). N-acetylcysteine prevented morphologic and oxidative derangements, and significantly reduced proinflammatory product secretion (P range<0.0001 to<0.00001 for TNF\u03b1, VCAM-1, MCP-1, and IL-6); rosuvastatin inhibited morphology and oxidative modifications only.

Concentrations of both serum glyc-apoB (glycated apoB) and SD-LDL (small dense LDL) (syn LDL3; D=1.044-1.063 g/ml) are increased in diabetes and are closely correlated. We studied whether SD-LDL is more susceptible to glycation in vitro than more buoyant LDL in statin- and non-statin-treated Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Serum SD-LDL apoB and glyc-apoB on statins was 20\u00b12 (means\u00b1S.D.) and 3.6\u00b10.41 compared with 47\u00b13 and 5.89\u00b10.68 mg/dl in those not receiving statins (P<0.001 and <0.01, respectively). There was a dose-dependent increase in glycation on incubation of LDL subfractions with glucose, which was accompanied by an increase in LPO (lipid peroxide) and electrophoretic mobility and a decrease in free amino groups. SD-LDL was more susceptible to these changes than more buoyant LDL. Both SD-LDL and more buoyant LDL from statin-treated patients were less susceptible to glycation. There were fewer free amino groups on LDL subfractions from statin-treated patients, which may contribute to this resistance. In conclusion, greater susceptibility of SD-LDL to glycation is likely to contribute to the raised levels of circulating glyc-apoB in diabetes. Statins are associated with lower levels of both SD-LDL and glyc-apoB.", 
    "80": "Atorvastatin is not only an antilipemic but also used as an anti-inflammatory medicine in heart disease. Our working hypothesis was that atorvastatin preconditioning could improve the forward blood flow in the no-reflow rats associated with inflammation. We investigated that two doses of atorvastatin preconditioning (20 and 5 mg/kg/day) could alleviate deterioration of early cardiac diastolic function in rats with inflammation detected by echocardiography and haemodynamics. This benefit was obtained from the effect of atorvastatin preconditioning on improving forward blood flow and preserving the infarct cardiomyocytes, which was estimated by Thioflavin S and TTC staining in rats with myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Subsequently, the improving of forward blood flow was ascribed to reduction of microthrombus in microvascular and myocardial fibrosis observed by MSB and Masson's trichrome staining with atorvastatin preconditioning. Ultimately, we found that atorvastatin preconditioning could reduce inflammation factor, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and fibrinogen-like protein 2, both in myocardial and in mononuclear cells, which probably attribute to microcirculation dysfunction in no-reflow rats detected by immunohistochemistry staining, western blot, and ELISA detection, respectively. In conclusion, atorvastatin preconditioning could alleviate deterioration of early cardiac diastolic function and improve the forward blood flow in the no-reflow rats attributing to reduction of TNF-\u03b1 and fgl-2 expression.",

However, it is still not known whether statin can improve autonomic remodeling to prevent AF. In the present study, using an in vivo rat myocardial infarction (MI) model, we aimed to test whether simvastatin can attenuate nerve sprouting and sympathetic hyperinnervation to prevent AF during the post-MI remodeling process. Our data demonstrate that simvastatin, delivered 3 days after MI for 4 wk, can result in significant decreases in plasma levels of both TNF-\u03b1 (239 \u00b1 23 pg/ml) and IL-1\u03b2 (123 \u00b1 11 pg/ml) compared with MI rats without therapy (TNF-\u03b1, 728 \u00b1 57 pg/ml; IL-1\u03b2, 213 \u00b1 21 pg/ml; P < 0.05), which, however, were still higher than sham-operated rats (TNF-\u03b1, 194 \u00b1 20 pg/ml; IL-1\u03b2, 75 \u00b1 8 pg/ml; P < 0.05). The similar pattern of changes in inflammation responses was also observed in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 protein expression in the left atrium free wall. The suppressed inflammation responses were associated with reduced superoxide and malondialdehyde generation in the atrium. These changes account for decreases in neural growth factor expression at levels of both mRNA (1.2 \u00b1 0.09 AU vs. MI group, 1.78 \u00b1 0.16 AU) and protein (1.57 \u00b1 0.17 AU vs. MI group, 2.24 \u00b1 0.19 AU; P < 0.05), thus resulting in reduced nerve sprouting and sympathetic hyperinnervation. Accordingly, the rate adaptation of the atrial effective refractory period also recovered, leading to the decreased inducibility of AF.

    "94": "Previously, the steroid hormone progesterone has been demonstrated to stimulate OATP2B1-mediated transport of estrone-3-sulphate (E(1)S), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) and pregnenolone sulphate (PS), which may influence the uptake of precursor molecules for steroid hormone synthesis. However, it is unclear whether OATP2B1 drug substrates like atorvastatin or glibenclamide are also affected by this phenomenon. In addition, it has not been studied so far if this stimulatory effect is specific for OATP2B1. To address these questions, we examined the influence of progesterone on OATP2B1-mediated atorvastatin and glibenclamide uptake and studied the impact of steroid hormones on the transport activity of OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Comparison of the substrate spectrum of the investigated OATPs revealed that DHEAS and atorvastatin are substrates of all transporters, while E(1)S was only significantly transported by OATP1A2, OATP2B1 and OATP1B1. Glibenclamide uptake was limited to OATP1A2, OATP1B1 and OATP2'B1. Subsequent interaction studies indicated that progesterone only increases OATP2B1-mediated E(1)S and DHEAS transport, whereas uptake of BSP, atorvastatin and glibenclamide was either inhibited or not affected. Moreover, the steroid hormone effect was specific for OATP2B1; neither OATP1B1, OATP1B3 nor OATP1A2 function was stimulated in the presence of progesterone. Similar to progesterone, the glucocorticoide dexamethasone stimulated OATP2B1-mediated transport of E(1)S and DHEAS (EC(50) for E(1)S: 10.2 \u00b1 5.6 \u03bcM and 17.9 \u00b1 15.4 \u03bcM for DHEAS). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that among the tested compounds the stimulatory effect of progesterone is specific for OATP2B1 and restricted to sulphated steroids like E(1)S and DHEAS while the OATP-mediated drug transport is not enhanced.",

The SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 axis plays a major role in cell homing to infarcted myocardium and is negatively regulated by CD26. Therefore, we studied the expression of CD26 during MI and its effects on cardiac function. Blood samples from forty-two patients who underwent a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a first ST-elevated MI were collected during primary PCI, 1 week and 3 months after MI. Soluble CD26 (sCD26) and membrane bound CD26 expression on MNCs (mncCD26) were determined. Left ventricular function and infarct size were measured within 1 day, 1 week and 3 months follow up by magnetic resonance imaging. One week post MI, sCD26 was down regulated compared to baseline, while mncCD26 was higher at baseline and 1 week compared to 3 months. Increased mncCD26 expression at 1 week after MI was associated with decreased overall recovery of left ventricular function as measured by left ventricular end systolic volume index. Furthermore, the in vitro migration capacity of MNCs to SDF-1\u03b1 was decreased 1 week post MI and the migration capacity to SDF-1\u03b1 was negatively correlated with mncCD26 expression. CD26 inhibition with sitagliptin - a drug currently used in diabetic patients - resulted in improved in vitro migration capacities of MNCs. In conclusion, our preliminary results suggest that high cellular CD26 expression decreases the migration of MNCs towards SDF-1\u03b1 and high cellular CD26 expression negatively influences cardiac function post MI. Treating patients shortly post MI with sitagliptin to inhibit CD26 may therefore increase MNC homing to the infarct area and could improve cardiac recovery and repair.",

    "101": "Osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis, the balancing acts for optimal bone health, are under the regulation of small guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins (GTPases) including Ras, Rac, Rho and Rab. The activities of GTPases require post-translational modification with mevalonate-derived prenyl pyrophosphates. Mevalonate deprivation induced by competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase (e.g., statins) prevents the activation of GTPases, suppresses the expression of the receptor for activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB) ligand (RANKL) and activation of NF\u03baB and, consequently, inhibits osteoclast differentiation and induces osteoclast apoptosis. In contrast, statin-mediated inactivation of GTPases enhances alkaline phosphatase activity and the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2, vascular epithelial growth factor, and osteocalcin in osteoblasts and induces osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. Animal studies show that statins inhibit bone resorption and increase bone formation. The anabolic effect of statins and other mevalonate pathway-suppressive pharmaceuticals resembles the anti-osteoclastogenic and bone-protective activities conferred by dietary isoprenoids, secondary products of plant mevalonate metabolism. The tocotrienols, vitamin E molecules with HMG CoA reductase-suppressive activity, induce mevalonate deprivation and concomitantly suppress the expression of RANKL and cyclooxygenase-2, the production of prostaglandin E2 and the activation of NF\u03baB. Accordingly, tocotrienols inhibit osteoclast differentiation and induce osteoclast apoptosis, impacts reminiscent of those of statins. In vivo studies confirm the bone protective activity of tocotrienols at nontoxic doses. Blends of tocotrienols, statins and isoprenoids widely found in fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs, spices, and essential oils may synergistically suppress osteoclastogenesis while promoting osteoblastogenesis, offering a novel approach to bone health that warrants clinical studies.",

Therefore, larger studies with a longer period of follow-up observing the separate effects are needed.", 
    "110": "Hesperetin-7-O-glucoside (Hes-7-G) was produced by the enzymatic conversion of hesperidin by Aspergillus sojae naringinase due to the removal of the terminal rhamnose. Extracts from orange juice and peel containing the hesperidin were so treated by this enzyme that the hesperidin could also be converted to Hes-7-G. The solubility of Hes-7-G in 10% ethanol was enhanced 55- and 88-fold over those of hesperidin and hesperetin, respectively, which may make Hes-7-G more bioavailable. Hes-7-G was 1.7- and 2.4-fold better than hesperidin and hesperetin, respectively, in the inhibition of human intestinal maltase. Hes-7-G was more potent by 2- and 4-fold than hesperidin in the inhibition of human HMG-CoA reductase. Additionally, Hes-7-G exhibited more effective inhibition of the growth of Helicobacter pylori than hesperetin, while its effectiveness was similar to that of hesperidin. Therefore, the results suggest that bioconverted Hes-7-G is more effective and bioavailable than hesperidin, as it has enhanced inhibitory and solubility properties.",

The racial/ethnic difference persisted after adjustment for age, gender, income, drug coverage, location, and health status. Patterns of adherence to statins and angiotensin-converting enzymes/angiotensin II receptor blockers were similar.

However, the SFA-induced parenchymal accumulation of plasma proteins could be prevented by co-administration of some cholesterol lowering agents.

Pravastatin, a water-soluble statin was less effective than atorvastatin (lipid-soluble). Statin effects were independent of changes in plasma lipid homeostasis. Ibuprofen, a lipid-soluble cyclooxygenase inhibitor attenuated cerebral accumulation of IgG and apo B as effectively as atorvastatin. Our findings are consistent with the drug effects being independent of plasma lipid homeostasis.",

    "123": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality within the United States and worldwide. Although targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the prevention of CVD has been shown to be effective, evidence exists to indicate that significant cardiovascular (CV) risk remains in patients receiving 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) - a risk that may be correlated with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Among the various tactics under investigation to increase HDL-C, inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) appears the most adept to raise these levels. Although torcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor, demonstrated significant beneficial changes in HDL-C and LDL-C after 12 months of therapy when coadministered with atorvastatin, patients in the torcetrapib arm experienced a rise in mortality, including increased risk of death from CV and non-CV causes as well as a significant rise in major CV events. Later studies established that the adverse effects of torcetrapib were produced from molecule-specific off-target effects and not to the mechanism of CETP inhibition. These untoward outcomes have not been detected with anacetrapib, the third of the CETP inhibitors to enter Phase III trials. Furthermore, treatment with anacetrapib revealed both a statistically significant decrease in LDL-C and increase in HDL-C over placebo. While the place in therapy of niacin and fibrates to reduce CV events is currently in question secondary to the Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL Cholesterol/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes and the Action to Control CV Risk in Diabetes trials, the ongoing large-scale, randomized-placebo, controlled-outcomes study with anacetrapib coadministered with statin treatment will not only test the hypothesis if CETP inhibition lowers residual CV risk but will also provide insight as to which patient subgroups might benefit the most from anacetrapib despite aggressive therapy with statins.",

Of all initial interventions, 182 endovascular reinterventions in 165 patients for recurrent femoropopliteal disease were identified (group SS, 70; group RS, 95). No differences were noted among the groups in gender, comorbidities, initial TASC II classification, run off, calcification scores, or statin or clopidogrel use, or both. Time to recurrence was similar in the RS and SS groups. TASC II classification, runoff score, and degree of calcification were similar between the two groups.

The area under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) for orally administered saquinavir after coadministration with 50 mg/kg ritonavir dramatically increased (325-fold). As a result, the bioavailability, Fa\u00b7Fg and Fh increased 75-, 38- and twofold, respectively.

    "166": "HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the four-electron reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate and is an enzyme of considerable biomedical relevance because of the impact of its statin inhibitors on public health. Although the reaction has been studied extensively using X-ray crystallography, there are surprisingly no computational studies that test the mechanistic hypotheses suggested for this complex reaction. Theozyme and quantum mechanical (QM)/molecular mechanical (MM) calculations up to the B3LYP/6-31g(d,p)//B3LYP/6-311++g(2d,2p) level of theory were employed to generate an atomistic description of the enzymatic reaction process and its energy profile. The models generated here predict that the catalytically important Glu83 is protonated prior to hydride transfer and that it acts as the general acid or base in the reaction. With Glu83 protonated, the activation energies calculated for the sequential hydride transfer reactions, 21.8 and 19.3 kcal/mol, are in qualitative agreement with the experimentally determined rate constant for the entire reaction (1 s(-1) to 1 min(-1)). When Glu83 is not protonated, the first hydride transfer reaction is predicted to be disfavored by >20 kcal/mol, and the activation energy is predicted to be higher by >10 kcal/mol. While not involved in the reaction as an acid or base, Lys267 is critical for stabilization of the transition state in forming an oxyanion hole with the protonated Glu83. Molecular dynamics simulations and MM/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area free energy calculations predict that the enzyme active site stabilizes the hemithioacetal intermediate better than the aldehyde intermediate. This suggests a mechanism in which cofactor exchange occurs before the breakdown of the hemithioacetal. Slowing the conversion to aldehyde would provide the enzyme with a mechanism to protect it from solvent and explain why the free aldehyde is not observed experimentally. Our results support the hypothesis that the pK(a) of an active site acidic group is modulated by the redox state of the cofactor. The oxidized cofactor and deprotonated Glu83 are closer in space after hydride transfer, indicating that indeed the cofactor may influence the pK(a) of Glu83 through an electrostatic interaction. The enzyme is able to catalyze the transfer of a hydride to the structurally and electronically distinct substrates by maintaining the general shape of the active site and adjusting the electrostatic environment through acid-base chemistry. Our results are in good agreement with the well-studied hydride transfer reactions catalyzed by liver alcohol dehydrogenase in calculated energy profile and reaction geometries despite different mechanistic functionalities.",

The aim of the study was to show whether the Rosuvastatin might be effective or not for the heart failure treatment. Twenty-one spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) aged 52 weeks with heart failure were randomly divided into three groups: two receiving Rosuvastatin at 20 and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively, and the third, placebo for comparison with seven Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) as controls. After an 8-week treatment, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and echocardiographic features were evaluated; mRNA level of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and plasma NT-proBNP concentration were measured; the heart tissues were observed under electron microscope (EM); myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) pump (SERCA-2) activity and mitochondria cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) activity were measured; the expressions of SERCA-2a, phospholamban (PLB), ryanodine receptor2 (RyR2), sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1), Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (PPI-1) were detected by Western blot and RT-qPCR; and the total and phosphorylation of protein kinase C\u03b1/\u03b2 (PKC\u03b1/\u03b2) were measured. Aged SHRs with heart failure was characterized by significantly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular fraction shortening, enhanced left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and LV Volume, accompanied by increased plasma NT-proBNP and elevated BNP gene expression. Damaged myofibrils, vacuolated mitochondria and swollen sarcoplasmic reticulum were observed by EM. Myocardium mitochondria CCO and SERCA-2 activity decreased. The expressions of PLB and NCX1 increased significantly with up-regulation of PPI-1 and down-regulation of CaMKII, whereas that of RyR2 decreased. Rosuvastatin was found to ameliorate the heart failure in aged SHRs and to improve changes in SERCA-2a, PLB, RyR2, NCX1, CaMKII and PPI-1; PKC\u03b1/\u03b22 signal pathway to be suppressed; the protective effect of Rosuvastatin to be dose dependent. In conclusion, the heart failure of aged SHRs that was developed during the end stage of hypertension could be ameliorated by Rosuvastatin.",

An electronic search for articles evaluating the influence of systemic medications on periimplant bone healing was conducted using the PubMed (MEDLINE) database. Statins, when administered locally or systemically, were found to increase bone formation and density. A reduction in bone turnover and bone-to-implant contact was observed in animal models examining the effect of glucocorticoids on periimplant bone healing. Continued use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during or after implant placement was associated with reduced bone-to-implant contact, bone area, and bone density. Evidence seems to suggest that statins improve implant osseointegration. However, glucocorticoids and NSAIDs showed conflicting results. Therefore, more randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the effect of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs on periimplant bone healing.",

An increase in cholesterol efflux through an enhancement of ABCA1 and caveolin-1 expression was also observed. In animal models of atherosclerosis, lycopene and tomato products decreased plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Aged rats and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with simvastatin in the presence and absence of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OX-LDL). Aortic \u03b2-galactosidase staining was undertaken to determine senescence, and SIRT1 protein expression was evaluated using Western blot analysis. After simvastatin therapy, arterial endothelial cell aging was significantly reduced, and SIRT1 expression was significantly increased. The OX-LDL significantly accelerated the senescence of umbilical vein endothelial cells and decreased SIRT1 expression. The OX-LDL-induced downregulation of SIRT1 was blocked by simvastatin.

Untreated Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in these patients are usually in the range 500 to 1200 mg/dL. Moreover, these patients exhibit a scarce responsiveness or even non responsiveness to oral lipid lowering agents. Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HetFH) tend to have untreated LDL-C levels of 250-500 mg/dL. Many of these patients are responsive to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGCoA-reductase) inhibitors (statins) and/or other specific drugs. Unfortunately, a significant subset of these patients (5-10%) have a severe and/or refractory form of HetFH and after current maximal oral therapy, they remain significantly far from treatment goals (The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) ATPIII guidelines). This would be defined as LDL-C levels of \u2265 190 mg/dL - prior Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or CHD equivalent - or \u2265 250 mg/dL (no prior CHD or CHD risk-equivalent). The only current therapy option for these patients is Low Density Lipoprotein-apheresis (LDL_a). While LDL_a is very effective in reducing LDL-C, many patients do not receive this extracorporeal therapy because of costs and limited availability of LDL_a centers. Recently, new potent lipid-lowering drugs have been developed and are currently under investigation. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays a critical role controlling the levels of LDL-C. Studies have demonstrated that PCSK9 acts mainly by enhancing degradation of the Low-Density Lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein in the liver. Inactivation of PCSK9 in mice reduces plasma cholesterol levels. Since the loss of a functional PCSK9 in human is not associated with apparent deleterious effects, this protease is becoming an attractive target for lowering plasma LDL-C levels either alone or in combination with statins. Mipomersen, an apolipoprotein B (ApoB) synthesis inhibitor, for lowering of LDL-C showed to be an effective therapy to reduce LDL-C concentrations in patients with HoFH who are already receiving lipid-lowering drugs, including high-dose statins. Lomitapide is a potent inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and is highly efficacious in reducing LDL-C and triglycerides (TG). Lomitapide is currently being developed for patients with HoFH at doses up to 60 mg/d. These new powerful lipid-lowering drugs might be possibly superior than available hypolipidemic agents. Their mechanisms of action, effectiveness, safety, and indication in severe, genetically determined dyslipidemias, are reviewed.",

To achieve further reduction in ASCVD events through cholesterol lowering will require new combinations with older agents and development of new drugs. The future of secondary prevention lies in testing of old and new \"add-on\" agents. Indications for statin use in primary prevention is less clear-cut. But clinical-trial experience with statins point to enormous potential for reducing ASCVD in the population. At the same time, there are dangers of overuse and turning society into a \"drug culture\". To abandon the benefits of healthy lifestyles for excessive drug intervention would be unfortunate.", 
    "215": "Insulin resistance is associated with the progression of atherosclerosis and is reported to predict cardiovascular mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Although statins exert pleiotropic effects, it is uncertain whether statin therapy improves insulin resistance in these patients. In this prospective randomized controlled trial, we aimed to evaluate the effects of statin on insulin resistance among 70 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD).", 
    "216": "Patients were randomized into a statin group (n = 35) or a control group (n = 35). The statin group received 10 mg per day of rosuvastatin for 6 months. We determined insulin resistance by homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. Serum concentrations of adipokines such as adiponectin, leptin, and resistin were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay. As inflammatory markers, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin-6 were also measured.", 
    "217": "There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. Compared to baseline value, statin treatment significantly decreased HOMA-IR index from 2.37 \u00b1 1.08 to 2.05 \u00b1 0.82 (P = 0.014). There was a concordant decrease in hsCRP levels in the statin group (2.05 \u00b1 1.57 to 1.21 \u00b1 0.84 mg/L, P < 0.001), but such improvements were not observed in the control group. When between-group differences in these parameters were compared, hsCRP levels were more decreased in the statin group than in the control group (P = 0.021 for between-group difference), whereas HOMA-IR index was not (P = 0.189 for between-group difference). During this period, statin treatment did not result in the improved adipokine profiles.", 
    "218": "This study showed that statin therapy failed to improve insulin resistance in PD patients despite a significant decline in hsCRP levels after statin treatment. Our finding suggests that reducing inflammation by statin is of limited help to fully attenuate insulin resistance in these patients.", 
    "219": "To review recent advances in our understanding of autoantibodies associated with dermatomyositis and the autoimmune necrotizing myopathies.", 
    "220": "Autoantibodies preferentially associated with dermatomyositis include those recognizing Mi-2, MDA5, TIF1\u03b3, and NXP-2. Each of these is associated with a distinct clinical phenotype. Autoantibodies found in patients with autoimmune necrotizing myopathies recognize signal recognition particle and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzime A reductase (HMG-CoA) reductase. The latter are found in patients with statin-associated autoimmune muscle disease.", 
    "221": "As these are helpful both diagnostically and prognostically, a rheumatologist should be familiar with autoantibodies found in patients with dermatomyositis and the autoimmune necrotizing myopathies.", 
    "222": "Several studies suggest that the presence of statins may be beneficial during sepsis, but this idea is controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of long-term statin treatment in the livers of septic animals, focusing on its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and metabolic properties.", 
    "223": "Male Wistar rats were treated orally with simvastatin, atorvastatin, or vehicle once a d. After 30 d, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in Control, Simvastatin-treated, and Atorvastatin-treated groups, while the Sham group underwent only laparotomy. The Basal Simvastatin and Basal Atorvastatin groups received only their respective drugs without surgery. Twenty-four h after CLP or laparotomy, samples were collected from anesthetized rats for evaluation of hepatic oxidative stress, liver histology, hepatic mitochondria enzyme activity, leukocyte counts in blood and peritoneal cavity, gene expression of hepatic superoxide dismutase and TNF-2, and plasma biochemistry.", 
    "224": "Most parameters that we tested exhibited expected changes upon sepsis induction. However, statin treatment only improved liver mitochondrial enzymatic activity. In other parameters, simvastatin and atorvastatin failed to protect the liver against injuries incurred upon the CLP-induced polymicrobial sepsis model.", 
    "225": "Pretreatment with simvastatin or atorvastatin alone before sepsis induction improved mitochondrial activity in the liver; however, this result was not reproduced in other biomarkers of liver function and leukocyte migration during sepsis. Future studies should be performed to evaluate whether statins can be combined with other drugs to increase the efficacy of sepsis therapy.", 
    "226": "Myocardial reperfusion therapy remains the most effective strategy to limit infarct size and improve clinical outcome. However, reperfusion injury is still inevitable, and a number of strategies have been developed to ameliorate its lethal outcome. The beneficial roles of ischemic postconditioning (Ipost) have regained more interest in targeting myocardial reperfusion phase to improve cardioprotection.", 
    "227": "This study was to determine whether acute or chronic treatment with atorvastatin affects cardioprotection when it was combined with Ipost.", 
    "228": "Acute or chronic atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced infarct size and recovered contractile dysfunction during reperfusion. When Ipost was combined with atorvastatin treatment, chronic, but not acute, atorvastatin therapy attenuated the cardioprotective effects of Ipost. Chronic, but not acute, atorvastatin treatment also abolished Ipost-induced phosphorylation level of Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).", 
    "229": "Chronic atorvastatin treatment could interfere with cardioprotective effects of Ipost on limiting infarct size and contractile dysfunction, possibly via inhibition of Akt and eNOS activity. This study suggests that Ipost should be used carefully when atorvastatin is taken by patients with AMI.", 
    "230": "The objective of this study was to carry out a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis of rosuvastatin compared with generic atorvastatin in the treatment of patients at high cardiovascular (CV) risk (\u2265 5% Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE]) and patients with prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Spain.", 
    "231": "The efficacy data from the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) study were used to simulate achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets with different doses of rosuvastatin and generic atorvastatin for an initial period of 1 year. A Markov model was used to estimate the number of CV complications, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and healthcare costs (lipid-lowering treatment and CV events) for up to 20 years after initial treatment. The analysis was carried out from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System, with costs (in year 2010 euros) and effects being discounted at 3% per year.", 
    "232": "Compared with generic atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was cost-effective (cost per QALY gained of less than \u20ac30,000) for the primary prevention of CV events in high-risk patients in most sub-groups analyzed. In patients with prior CVD, rosuvastatin was cost-effective in all sub-groups of men and most sub-groups of women. Key limitations of this study were the need to extrapolate data from a single trial to long-term modeled outcomes and the absence of other treatment options in the analysis.", 
    "233": "For the treatment of dyslipidemic patients with high CV risk, rosuvastatin is more effective than generic atorvastatin in terms of survival and quality-of-life adjusted survival, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios within the range generally used in Spain, in most sub-populations defined by various combinations of CV risk factors.", 
    "234": "Despite widespread statin therapy, 91% of cardiac transplant patients have hyperlipidemia within 5 years from cardiac transplantation. The implications of this are profound, particularly given that coronary allograft vasculopathy is a leading cause of death. Unfortunately the solution is not easy, with problems of toleration at higher statin doses and a lack of good quality evidence for second line agents. We review the literature and discuss some of the key issues transplant physicians are faced with when considering alternatives to statin therapy.", 
    "235": "The study aims were to test the effect of rosuvastatin on the progression of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in patients with aortic stenosis (AS), and to evaluate the use of beta-natriuretic-peptide (BNP) as a marker of diastolic dysfunction in this condition.", 
    "236": "Sixty-one hypercholesterolemic, consecutive new referrals with moderate AS were administered rosuvastatin (Crestor) 20 mg/day for 18 months, while a further 60 subjects with normal cholesterol levels remained untreated. The LV diastolic function was determined using conventional Doppler echocardiography, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI); BNP plasma levels were monitored when subjects entered the study and then assessed prospectively at six-month intervals until the study end.", 
    "237": "After an 18-month (mean 73 +/- 24 weeks) period of treatment with rosuvastatin (Tx group), patients showed a significantly better diastolic function than untreated subjects (uTx group), as indicated by an isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) (Tx 102.0 +/- 42.8 versus 97.2 +/- 19.1; p < 0.001; uTx 99.7 +/- 21.7 versus 95.2 +/- 21.8 ms; p = 0.032), E/A ratio (Tx 1.0 +/- 0.6 versus 0.9 +/- 0.3, p = 0.52; uTx 1.2 +/- 0.40 versus 0.9 +/- 0.30 versus, p = 0.006), and E/E' ratio (Tx 11.4 +/- 1.5 versus 11.4 +/- 1.8, p = 0.19; uTx 15.4 +/- 1.2 versus 12.3 +/- 1.5, p < 0.001). Similarly, at study end, plasma levels of BNP were significantly lower in the Tx group than in the uTx group [median (1st-3rd quartiles): 37.0 pg/ml (20.1-65.2 pg/ml) versus 57.1 pg/ml (46.9-98.2 pg/ml); p = 0.017].", 
    "238": "The results of this prospective follow up study of asymptomatic patients showed that rosuvastatin treatment delays the progression of diastolic dysfunction in moderate AS when assessed using hemodynamic echocardiographic parameters or by the release of plasma physiological markers. Hence, the benefits of statin treatment in AS, which are known to affect the valve endothelium, also extend to changes affecting myocardial function itself.", 
    "239": "The cardioprotective role that statin and aspirin has appears to be reduced in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This analysis aims to evaluate the impact of statin and aspirin on the outcome of patients with CKD and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).", 
    "240": "All patients who were enrolled in the IN-ACS Outcome registry, diagnosed with CKD, were included in our analysis. We divided patients into four groups, according to previous chronic therapy: neither aspirin nor statin therapy (Group 1), aspirin only therapy (Group 2), statin only therapy (Group 3) and aspirin plus statin therapy (Group 4).", 
    "241": "Of the 5483 patients enrolled that had data on glomerular filtration rate available, 1484 had CKD: These segregated into 589 patients in Group 1, 477 in Group 2, 89 in Group 3 and 329 in Group 4. Despite having a higher baseline risk profile, groups 3 and 4, as compared to the other two groups, exhibited a significantly lower in-hospital mortality (1% in Group 3, 2% in Group 4; but 8% in Group 1 and 7% in Group 2, p\u2009=\u20090.0007); while at 30 days it remained so, as it was 1% in Group 3, 4% in Group 4 (and 10% in Group 1 and 10% in Group 2 p\u2009=\u20090.0002); and at 1 year it was 11% in Group 3 and 13% in Group 4 (compared to 20% in Group 1 and 23% in Group 2, p\u2009=\u20090.0012).", 
    "242": "In a large cohort of patients with CKD and ACS, chronic treatment with statin or the combination of aspirin and statin is associated with short-term and long-term better outcomes for in-hospital mortality, as compared to those receiving no therapy or aspirin therapy alone.", 
    "243": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of symptomatic atherosclerosis that leads to a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular events, including major limb loss, myocardial infarction, stroke and death. The prevalence proportions of PAD increase dramatically with age and appear to progress more aggressively in women than in men. Several studies have indicated that the use of secondary medical prevention is generally insufficient among PAD patients. However, current national and international guidelines recommend lipid-lowering and anti-platelet therapy, supplemented with aggressive blood pressure lowering treatment. We aimed to determine whether there were age-, gender-, geography or time related differences in the use of secondary medical prevention, following primary vascular reconstruction. We also sought to describe the prognoses for the same population, according to the association between the use of ACE/ATII inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists) or beta blockers and clinical outcomes (all cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, major amputation and/or recurrent vascular surgery) in a population-based, long-term follow-up study. We established a data base by linking four population based administrative and health-care registries. All Danish patients undergoing primary vascular surgical reconstruction due to atherosclerotic disease between 1997 and 2007 were included and identified in the Danish Vascular Registry; a total of 20,761 patients were followed during a median of 582 days (range of 30 to 4,379 days). Data regarding all prescriptions filled by the study population were obtained from the Medical Registry of the Danish Medicines Agency. Study I: Age- and gender-related differences. We found moderate to low use of secondary medical prevention. However, this use has increased in recent years and the age- and gender-related differences in use have been reduced or eliminated. Study II: Geographic or time related differences. The use of evidence-based secondary medical prevention, especially lipid-lowering drugs, increased substantially over time, regardless of socio-demographic and clinical factors. No substantial differences in pharmacological use according to location of residence were observed. Study III: Use of ACE/ATII and prognosis. We found the use of ACE inhibitors to be associated with lower all cause mortality but also an increased long-term risk of recurrent vascular reconstruction and myocardial infarction. Study IV: Use of beta blockers and prognosis. We found beta blocker use to be associated with a lower risk of major amputation, but also an increased risk of new myocardial infarction and stroke. No association were found regarding all cause mortality or the risk of recurrent vascular surgery. In conclusion, the use of secondary medical prevention following primary vascular surgery (between 1996 and 2006 in Denmark) shifted towards a more evidence-based treatment, as reduction in age-, gender- and geography related differences were observed early in the study period. However, recommendations for the current clinical guidelines suggest that additional improvement can be made. The treatment of hypertension in PAD patients is complex, and our results are also complex but indicate that ACE/ATII and beta blockers are safe for use in symptomatic PAD patients.", 
    "244": "Not all patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are optimally treated with statin, and their adherence to statin treatment may be inadequate. We set out to describe changes in statin treatment adherence and cholesterol values over time.", 
    "245": "Data from two cohorts of AMI patients discharged from the Department of Cardiology, Odense University Hospital, in 2003 (n = 474, mean age 68 years, 66% males) and 2008 (n = 550, mean age 67 years, 69% males) were compared. Based on the number of tablets collected at the pharmacy, patients' adherence to statin treatment in a period of two years after discharge was analysed. Patients were considered adherent when in possession of medication \u2265 80% of the period. From the day of admission and at follow-up, cholesterol values and the relative number of patients with a total-cholesterol < 4.5 mmol/l were calculated.", 
    "246": "A significant improvement in statin adherence was noted: 42% versus 75% (p < 0.0001). The most significant difference was observed in patients \u2265 80 years, who improved from 25% to 72% (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, an overall significant reduction in follow-up cholesterol levels was observed: from 4.4 to 4.2 mmol/l (p = 0.003). More-over, an increase was observed in the proportion of patients with a follow-up cholesterol value < 4.5 mmol/l: from 57% to 67% (p = 0.001). The most significant changes were demonstrated in patients \u2265 70 years.", 
    "247": "Over the five-year period from 2003 to 2008, statin adherence and cholesterol values significantly improved. However, room for improvement remains, particularly in younger patients.",

    "250": "We investigated the effects of the use of vitamin E-coated membrane (VEM) dialyzer in comparison to simvastatin on markers of chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial cell apoptosis in ten patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD), aiming at distinguishing the different treatment effects and their time sequence on these pathogenetic routes.", 
    "251": "Ten HD patients were sequentially submitted to a 6-month treatment with the use of VEM and 10 mg of simvastatin daily, interrupted by a 3-month washout period. At baseline, at 3, and 6 months of each trial, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 and B, lipoprotein-a [Lp(a)], high-sensitivity interleukin-6 (hsIL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), soluble Fas (sFas), soluble Fas ligand (sFasL), and plasma oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL) levels were determined.", 
    "252": "VEM treatment resulted in a significant decrease in CRP, IL-6, sICAM-1 at 3 months, and oxLDL at 6 months, compared to baseline. Simvastatin resulted in a significant decrease in CRP, which correlated with decreases in both total (r = 0.87, p < 0.05) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, IL-6, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, oxLDL, and sFas at 6 months, compared to baseline. Simvastatin effects on sVCAM-1 (mean difference = 652 ng/mL; 95% CI = 294 to 2686; p < 0.05) and sFas (mean difference = 1284 pg/mL; 95% CI = 510 to 1910; p < 0.05) differed significantly from the corresponding VEM effects.", 
    "253": "The 6-month use of VEM resulted in more direct and immediate anti-inflammatory effects compared with those caused by the 6-month treatment with simvastatin. Simvastatin caused a more intense decrease in the markers of inflammation, which was in part correlated with its lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "254": "Oxidative stress has been paid increasing attention to as an important causative factor for diabetic vascular complications. Among possible various sources, accumulating evidence has indicated that NAD(P)H oxidase may be the most important source for reactive oxygen species production in diabetic vascular tissues. The mechanisms underlying activation and up-regulation of NAD(P)H oxidase has been supposed to be mediated by high glucose-induced protein kinase C (PKC) activation. In this review article, activation of local renin-angiotensin II system induced by chymase activation is also shown to amplify such a PKC-dependent activation of NAD(P)H oxidase. Additionally, human evidence showing the beneficial effect of antioxidants on diabetic vascular complications. Bilirubin has been recognized as a strong endogenous antioxidant. Here markedly lower prevalence of vascular complications is shown in diabetic patients with Gilbert syndrome, a congenital hyperbilirubinemia, as well as reduced markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Lastly, statin, angiotensin II receptor blocker, chymase inhibitor, bilirubin and biliverdin, PKC \u03b2 isoform inhibitor, and glucagon-like peptide-1 analog, are shown to serve as antioxidants and have some beneficial effect on diabetic vascular complications, via inhibiting PKC-NAD(P)H oxidase activation, supporting the notion that this mechanism may be an effective therapeutic target for preventing diabetic vascular complications."
