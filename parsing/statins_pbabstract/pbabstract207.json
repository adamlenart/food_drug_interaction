Sublethal effects (changes in glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPx), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and cholesterol (CHL) levels) and lethal effects (survival) were determined after individual exposure to the three compounds. There were no significant differences in GSH or CHL levels in fish exposed to any of the test compounds. LPx levels significantly decreased with increasing irgarol concentrations. AChE levels were significantly lower in fish exposed to simvastatin at the 1.25 mg/L concentration and significantly higher at the PBDE-47 concentration of 0.0125 mg/L. The LC50 values were 2.68, 3.22, and > 0.1 mg/L for simvastatin, irgarol and PBDE-47, respectively.",

This paper describes a special patient with SLO syndrome. Laboratory examination showed low cholesterol (2.77 mmol/L) and increased 7-dehydrocholesterol level (102 mg/L). Molecular genetic analysis revealed a compound heterozygosity c.964-1G>C/p.G366V (c.G1370T) of the proband. The p.G366V is a novel mutation of the DHCR7 gene with guanine by thymine nucleotide exchange resulting in glycin by valin amino acid exchange in the dehydrocholesterol reductase enzyme. Simvastatin (0.2 mg/kg/day) and cholesterol replacement therapy (150-250 mg/kg/day) led to significant improvement in the patient's laboratory findings (7-dehydrocholesterol, cholesterol) as well as in his behavior and gross motor function.",

    "5": "Adjusted systolic blood pressure was on average 1.8 mmHg lower in statins users than in nonusers (P = 0.05). Although statins had no significant effect among nonusers, it decreased systolic blood pressure by 3.3 mmHg among users of antihypertensive medication (interaction P = 0.02). The effect of statins on systolic blood pressure was similar in individuals with HDL-C levels above and below the median (49 mg/dl). Statins also lowered diastolic blood pressure by an average of 1.9 mmHg (P < 0.01), regardless of antihypertensive medication use. Among individuals with high HDL-C statins did not lower diastolic blood pressure, whereas in those with low HDL-C diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 3.4 mmHg. The effect of statins on systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased with higher blood pressure and changed little with adjustment for total cholesterol.",

Statins may be beneficial in preventing hypertension and may contribute to better blood pressure control in hypertensive patients.", 
    "7": "Hypertension is a major co-morbidity for type 2 diabetes, and an important modifiable risk factor for vascular events. Therefore, treatment of diabetes and its risk factors is important to minimize complications, and much progress has been made over the past 30 years. The UKPDS trial showed that intensive glycaemic and blood pressure control reduced the risk of vascular events. In the HOT study, the addition of aspirin to patients with diabetes and controlled hypertension decreased the risk of myocardial infarction. Blood pressure control with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in MICRO-HOPE also showed significant reductions in the risk of vascular complications, and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system produced substantial renal protective effects in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Statin therapy in the HPS and CARDS studies was effective in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disorders. Finally, an intensive multifactorial intervention achieved sustained reduction in the risk of vascular complications and death in patients with type 2 diabetes in the Steno-2 study. Nevertheless, the major coronary event risk remains high in type 2 diabetes patients, and the results of the ADVANCE trial provided a step forward in treatment.", 
    "8": "Carotid stenosis is a major risk factor for stroke and transient ischaemic attack. Asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenoses need to be considered separately. Carotid endarterectomy was established as the treatment of choice for recently symptomatic severe carotid stenosis by two landmark trials. The effect of surgery is much less in patients with moderate carotid stenosis and harmful in patients with stenosis of less than 50%. Suitable patients should be operated on within 2 weeks of symptoms because the benefit of endarterectomy declines rapidly with increasing time between symptom onset and treatment. The benefits of endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis shown in the randomised trials were much less. Improvements in medical treatment, especially increasing statin use after the trials were started, need to be taken into consideration when interpreting the trials, and most neurologists conclude that routine endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis is not justified. Early trials of endovascular treatment of carotid stenosis suggested that endovascular treatment might be a safe and effective alternative to carotid endarterectomy. However, subsequent trials have so far failed to provide enough evidence to justify routine carotid stenting as an alternative to endarterectomy in patients fit for surgery. More data from ongoing randomised trials of stenting versus endarterectomy are needed to determine the role of stenting in the treatment of carotid stenosis.", 
    "9": "Dyslipidemia is a recognized risk factor for coronary arterial disease, but its role as risk factor for stroke has been controversial for a long time. In the last years, much attention has been paid to lipid-lowering therapies as a key preventive measure to reduce stroke risk.",

    "11": "Data from large cohort prospective studies, case-control studies and clinical trials confirm the association between serum lipids and stroke risk. In secondary stroke prevention, atorvastatin 80 mg is effective in patients with prior transient ischemic attack and noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. Pretreatment with statins in stroke patients is associated with better outcomes. This protective effect is more evident in atherothrombotic and lacunar infarctions. Statin withdrawal during acute stroke is associated with loss of the protective effect, and statin discontinuation after an acute ischemic stroke is also associated with higher mortality at 1 year of follow-up.", 
    "12": "Dyslipidemia is a modifiable stroke risk factor. Long treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg has been associated with reduced risk of stroke recurrences and other cardiovascular events in patients with noncardioembolic transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke. Prior statin treatment is associated with lower stroke severity and better outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients. Statin treatment should never be discontinued in these patients.", 
    "13": "Besides a beneficial cardiovascular effect, it was recently suggested that statins can also exert neuroprotective actions. In a previous study, we provided in vitro evidence that lovastatin treatment abates excitotoxic cell death in primary cortical neurons. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of lovastatin in an in vivo mouse model. We found that administration of lovastatin (20 mg/kg) significantly protects cholinergic neurons and their cortical projections against N-methyl-D-aspartate (60 nmol)-induced cell death in the magnocellular nucleus basalis, a neuronal cell group that is characteristically affected in Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, lovastatin-mediated neuroprotection was shown to be dependent on protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt signaling since treatment with the PKB/Akt inhibitor LY294002 blocked the lovastatin-induced neuroprotective effect. The loss of cholinergic neurons after the lesion in the magnocellular nucleus basalis resulted in memory impairment as tested in a passive avoidance paradigm. This was reverted by pre-lesion lovastatin treatment. From these studies we conclude that treatment with lovastatin may provide protection against neuronal injury in excitotoxic conditions associated with neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "14": "Statins, used as cholesterol-lowering drugs, were reported to reduce the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these findings remain to be clarified and it is not well understood whether this beneficial effect is due to simply lowering cholesterol levels. This study was aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of simvastatin and lovastatin, lipophilic statins that can transverse the blood brain barrier, against the toxicity triggered by the AD-associated amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides and to analyze if such protection is cholesterol-independent. Using primary cultures of cortical neurons treated with Abeta1-40 peptide, we have demonstrated that pre-incubation with statins prevents the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species induced by Abeta through mechanisms independent of cholesterol reduction. The neuroprotective actions of statins were rather attributable to their ability to reduce isoprenyl intermediates levels in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway since their effect was reversed by geranyl pyrophosphate while cholesterol addition was ineffective. Consequently, statins were shown to rescue cortical neurons from Abeta-40-induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Moreover, our results revealed that simvastatin, at neuroprotective concentrations against Abeta-induced toxicity, is not able to activate Akt or ERK2, two signaling kinases with neuroprotective roles against apoptosis.",

It is unclear which risk algorithm and guidelines should be used in European populations. Using data from a population-based study in Switzerland, we first assessed 10-year CHD risk and eligibility for statins in 5,683 women and men 35 to 75 years of age without cardiovascular disease by comparing recommendations by the European Society of Cardiology without and with extrapolation of risk to age 60 years, the International Atherosclerosis Society, and the US Adult Treatment Panel III. The proportions of participants classified as high-risk for CHD were 12.5% (15.4% with extrapolation), 3.0%, and 5.8%, respectively. Proportions of participants eligible for statins were 9.2% (11.6% with extrapolation), 13.7%, and 16.7%, respectively. Assuming full compliance to each guideline, expected relative decreases in CHD deaths in Switzerland over a 10-year period would be 16.4% (17.5% with extrapolation), 18.7%, and 19.3%, respectively; the corresponding numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 CHD death would be 285 (340 with extrapolation), 380, and 440, respectively. In conclusion, the proportion of subjects classified as high risk for CHD varied over a fivefold range across recommendations. Following the International Atherosclerosis Society and the Adult Treatment Panel III recommendations might prevent more CHD deaths at the cost of higher numbers needed to treat compared with European Society of Cardiology guidelines.", 
    "23": "Previous studies have shown seasonal variation in lipids. To understand whether this variation exists in patients with acute coronary syndromes receiving statins, we examined data from the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 Study. At baseline, no significant difference in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed when stratified by season. However, a statistically significant difference in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol between winter (37 mg/dl) and summer (39 mg/dl) was observed (p <0.001) at baseline. On treatment, median LDL cholesterol was 102 mg/dl in winter versus 96 mg/dl in summer (p <0.001) for the pravastatin group and 68 mg/dl in winter versus 62 mg/dl in summer (p <0.001) for the atorvastatin group. Median high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 43 mg/dl in summer versus 41 mg/dl in winter in the pravastatin group and 42 mg/dl in summer versus 39 mg/dl in winter in the atorvastatin group (p <0.001). More patients achieved LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl in summer at 56% versus 47% in winter in the pravastatin group (p <0.001) and 89% versus 87% in winter for the atorvastatin group (p = 0.11). Achievement of LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl was also higher in summer than winter. In conclusion, this was the first evidence of seasonal variability in cholesterol in patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with statins. This variability affected achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program goals and may affect management decisions based on season of collection.", 
    "24": "Feeding rats with a high-fructose diet induced insulin resistance, leading to hypertension or metabolic disorders. Although hypertension is known to accelerate osteoporosis, it is not obvious whether insulin resistance would accelerate osteoporosis. In this study, we evaluated whether osteoporosis might accelerate in fructose-fed rats (FFR), and examined the effect of fluvastatin through a blockade of the mevalonate pathway and an antioxidant action. Stimulation of recombinant receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) ligand (RANKL) expressed by osteoblasts/ stromal cells and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) significantly increased TRAP-positive multinuclear osteoclasts and pit formation, accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species as assessed by dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF) staining. Interestingly, it was completely abolished by treatment with fluvastatin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), but not pravastatin. These actions of fluvastatin were partially abolished by co-treatment with geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), but not farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP). In the estrogen-deficient model by ovariectomy, FFR exhibited a decrease in bone mineral density, activation of osteoclasts, and an increase in urinary deoxypyridinoline. Importantly, the treatment of fluvastatin, but not pravastatin, attenuated FFR-induced osteoporosis. The present study demonstrates that fructose fed to rats induced insulin resistance and accelerated osteoporosis, while fluvastatin, but not pravastatin, significantly attenuated osteoclast differentiation and activation through a blockade of the classical mevalonate pathway and an antioxidant action, leading to prevention of osteoporosis.", 
    "25": "Breast cancer mortality is strongly related to the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells. We previously showed that an active mutant of H-Ras induced invasive phenotype of MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. Membrane anchoring of Ras requires isoprenylation which involves the activity of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, widely used for hypercholesterolemia, on H-Ras-induced invasion of MCF10A cells. Treatment of H-Ras MCF10A cells with simvastatin and lovastatin markedly decreased isoprenylated H-Ras in membrane fraction while the unprenylated H-Ras was increased in cytosol fraction, demonstrating that these statins inhibited membrane anchoring of H-Ras in MCF10A cells. Simvastatin and lovastatin significantly inhibited H-Ras-induced invasion which was reversed by farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), indicating that the inhibitory effect was related to inhibition of the biosynthesis of prenylated derivatives. Statins downregulated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and, to a lesser extent, MMP-2 in H-Ras MCF10A cells. Simvastatin and lovastatin inactivated H-Ras downstream signaling molecules, possibly by inhibiting H-Ras membrane localization and thus its function in MCF10A cells. Taken together, this study clearly demonstrated the inhibitory effect of simvastatin and lovastatin on H-Ras-induced invasion, MMP expression and signal transduction in MCF10A breast epithelial cells, providing supporting rationale for future statin trials as a therapeutic intervention to regulate breast cancer metastasis.",

This theory was tested in humans using dipyridamole-induced vasodilation as a read-out for local adenosine formation.

In addition, healthy men were randomly divided in 3 groups to receive either placebo (n=10), rosuvastatin (n=22), or rosuvastatin combined with intravenous caffeine (n=12). Subsequently, volunteers performed forearm ischemic exercise. At reperfusion, Tc-99m-labeled annexin A5 was infused intravenously and scintigraphic images were acquired, providing an early marker of cell injury. Rosuvastatin treatment significantly increased the vasodilator response to dipyridamole, which was prevented by caffeine. Rosuvastatin did not influence the response to either sodium nitroprusside or adenosine indicating a specific interaction between rosuvastatin and dipyridamole, which does not result from an effect of rosuvastatin on adenosine clearance nor adenosine-receptor affinity or efficacy. Rosuvastatin increased tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion injury, which was attenuated by caffeine.",

However, clinical application of statins has been limited by high dose toxicity. Previous studies showed that combined statin and gamma-tocotrienol treatment synergistically inhibits growth of highly malignant +SA mammary epithelial cells in culture. To investigate the mechanism mediating this growth inhibition, studies were conducted to determine the effect of combination low dose gamma-tocotrienol and statin treatment on +SA mammary tumor cell cycle progression. Treatment with 0.25 microM simvastatin, lovastatin, mevastatin, 10 microM pravastatin or 2.0 microM gamma-tocotrienol alone had no effect, while combined treatment of individual statins with gamma-tocotrienol significantly inhibited +SA cell proliferation during the 4-day culture period. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that combined treatment induced cell cycle arrest in G1. Additional studies showed that treatment with 0.25 microM simvastatin or 2 microM gamma-tocotrienol alone had no effect on the relative intracellular levels of cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6, but combined treatment caused a large reduction in cyclin D1 and CDK2 levels. Combined treatments also caused a relatively large increase in p27, but had no effect on p21 and p15 levels, and resulted in a large reduction in retinoblastoma (Rb) protein phosphorylation at ser780 and ser807/811. Similar effects were observed following combined treatment of gamma-tocotrienol with low doses of lovastatin, mevastatin and pravastatin. These findings demonstrate that combination low dose statin and gamma-tocotrienol treatment induced mammary tumor cell cycle arrest at G1, resulting from an increase in p27 expression, and a corresponding decrease in cyclin D1, CDK2, and hypophosphorylation of Rb protein. These findings suggest that combined treatment of statins with gamma-tocotrienol may provide significant health benefits in the treatment of breast cancer in women, while avoiding myotoxicity associated with high dose statin monotherapy.",

    "49": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the developed world in both men and women. Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are strong and independent vascular risk factors in both genders. Statins effectively decrease LDL-C levels, reduce vascular morbidity and mortality and are an essential component of CHD preventive strategies. However, women are less likely to be prescribed statins than men in both primary and secondary prevention settings. It was argued that there is no conclusive evidence showing that statins are beneficial for the prevention of vascular disease in women, particularly in those without established CHD. This review summarizes the evidence regarding the effects of statins in the prevention of CHD in women. Accumulating data suggest that statins are equally effective in both men and women. The lack of significant effects in some studies appears to be primarily due to the under-representation of women and the ensuing lack of statistical power. Current guidelines for the prevention of vascular disease also recommend a similar management of dyslipidemia in both men and women. Therefore, statin treatment should be implemented with the same criteria and with the same goals in both genders.", 
    "50": "The role of elevated triglyceride (TG) levels in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is controversial. Some studies suggest that TG might play a direct role in the development of vascular disease. Elevated TG levels are also associated with other vascular risk factors and may therefore represent an indirect marker of a high risk state. Another issue is that laboratory measurements of TG levels frequently show a substantial variability. Accumulating epidemiological data show that there is an independent association of TG levels with vascular risk. Some interventional studies also suggested that lowering TG levels might prevent vascular events. It appears that TG might be more important as therapeutic targets against a background of optimal low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. In this context, statins that are more effective in reducing TG levels, fibrates that can safely be combined with statins or fixed fibrate and statin combinations, as well as new, better tolerated nicotinic acid formulations might prove to be particularly beneficial.",

The incremental cost effectiveness of amlodipine-based therapy compared with atenolol-based therapy was euro 9,548 and euro 3,965 per QALY gained in the UK and Sweden, respectively. Atenolol-based therapy plus atorvastatin was eliminated through extended dominance.

Clinical examination documented both an increase in liver size and proximal muscle weakness, with difficulty in raising arms above the head. Blood tests showed the presence of renal, liver and muscle failure, with no evidence of virological, immunological or haematological diseases. Rosuvastatin treatment was stopped and blood values normalised within five days; but because of an increase in cholesterol plasma levels, rosuvastatin (10 mg/day) was restarted. Two days later, the patient returned to our observation due to the development of asthenia and muscle weakness, with an increase in creatine phosphokinase, 12,165 U/l. Rosuvastatin was discontinued and replaced with pravastatin (40 mg/day) with a complete resolution of clinical and laboratory findings in about six days.

We previously demonstrated that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) increased NCX1 expression by activating RhoB in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Conversely, fluvastatin (Flv), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, decreased NCX1 mRNA and protein expression by inhibiting RhoB. RhoB can be isoprenylated by either geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) or farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP). Here we investigated which of GGPP or FPP is involved in the NCX1-increasing effect of LPC. When LPC was added with GGPP to the Flv-treated H9c2 cells, NCX1 mRNA was increased to a level significantly higher than that in the control cells. Only GGPP, but not FPP, allowed LPC to increase NCX1 mRNA in the presence of Flv. Furthermore, geranylgeranyltransferase 1 inhibitor (GGTI), but not farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI), inhibited the LPC-induced NCX1 mRNA increase. We conclude that geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation, of RhoB mediates LPC-induced NCX1 mRNA increase in H9c2 cells.",

Although several post-hoc analyses and meta-analyses of large randomized clinical trials of statins in cardiovascular disease have provided important insights into their role in affecting the rate of renal function deterioration in CKD, no randomized clinical study has directly addressed this issue in CKD patients. In this review, we discuss the preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the beneficial or harmful effects of statins in CKD patients and propose specific recommendations regarding their use in this patient population.",

Both juices did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of either simvastatin lactone (SVL) or its active metabolite simvastatin hydroxy acid (SVA) when administered concomitantly in a dose of 20 mg/kg over 28 days. However, when administered with 80 mg/kg simvastatin concentrations were elevated up to the last day of the study with DS-GFJ and to a lesser extent with RS-GFJ. Evaluation of toxicological parameters revealed a significant decrease in body and liver weights in groups receiving 20 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg simvastatin alone as well as in groups receiving simvastatin concomitantly with either DS- or RS-GFJ. No significant differences were detected for alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) aminotranferases in all groups. Chronic treatment with simvastatin significantly decreased plasma cholesterol levels (18 % for 20 mg/kg, 19 % for 80 mg/kg, respectively) as did coadministration of 80 mg/kg simvastatin with either RS-GFJ or DS-GFJ (33 %, 16 %). Interestingly, treatment with RS- or DS-GFJ alone significantly decreased plasma cholesterol levels by 22 % and 30 %, respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest that toxic effects in rats of concomitant intake of simvastatin and GFJ over 28 days are not more pronounced than those of simvastatin alone and that dose relationships between the administration of the juice and the drug may be important in determining the magnitude of the interaction.",

    "94": "Remyelination of lesions in the central nervous system contributes to neural repair following clinical relapses in multiple sclerosis. Remyelination is initiated by recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into myelinating oligodendrocytes. Simvastatin, a blood-brain barrier-permeable statin in multiple sclerosis clinical trials, has been shown to impact the in vitro processes that have been implicated in remyelination. Animals were fed a cuprizone-supplemented diet for 6 weeks to induce localized demyelination in the corpus callosum; subsequent return to normal diet for 3 weeks stimulated remyelination. Simvastatin was injected intraperitoneally during the period of coincident demyelination and OPC maturation (weeks 4 to 6), throughout the entire period of OPC responses (weeks 4 to 9), or during the remyelination-only phase (weeks 7 to 9). Simvastatin treatment (weeks 4 to 6) caused a decrease in myelin load and both Olig2(strong) and Nkx2.2(strong) OPC numbers. Simvastatin treatment (weeks 4 to 9 and 7 to 9) caused a decrease in myelin load, which was correlated with a reduction in Nkx2.2(strong) OPCs and an increase in Olig2(strong) cells, suggesting that OPCs were maintained in an immature state (Olig2(strong)/Nkx2.2(weak)). NogoA+ oligodendrocyte numbers were decreased during all simvastatin treatment regimens. Our findings suggest that simvastatin inhibits central nervous system remyelination by blocking progenitor differentiation, indicating the need to monitor effects of systemic immunotherapies that can access the central nervous system on brain tissue-repair processes.",

    "103": "Heart failure with a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) is a common clinical problem with many unsolved questions regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy. Although the term diastolic heart failure has been abandoned, diastolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction together with combined systolic ventricular and arterial stiffening are considered to be the main pathophysiologic mechanisms in HFNEF. Current guidelines define HFNEF by symptoms or signs of heart failure in the presence of LV ejection fraction of more than 50%, but with additional evidence of LV diastolic dysfunction. Definite diagnosis of HFNEF requires exclusion of valvular heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, and several noncardiac diseases. Echocardiographic assessment of the tissue Doppler-derived filling index E/E', which is the ratio of the peak early mitral valve flow velocity to the peak early diastolic mitral annular velocity, should improve the noninvasive estimation of filling pressures in suspected HFNEF. Elevated plasma levels of natriuretic peptides may confirm HFNEF if tissue Doppler echocardiography is inconclusive. Treatment of HFNEF is symptom oriented and mainly based on pathophysiologic assumptions such as heart rate reduction, blood pressure control, and maintenance of sinus rhythm. In contrast to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, large-scale randomized controlled drug trials for HFNEF are scarce and could not demonstrate mortality reduction so far.",

We review the literature concerning the complications encountered in free flap surgery related to the ischaemia-reperfusion injury and detail the effects of statins relevant to this endothelial dysfunction. Statins, because of their pleiotropic effects such as preservation of vascular tone, anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory properties, appear to be useful in free flap surgery. This study highlights the benefits of statins in order to increase the success rate and the quality of the free flap. They should be included in the perioperative strategy, especially in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. A protocol is presented.",

Since the apo A-I mimetic peptide D-4F has been shown to inhibit atherosclerotic lesion formation and regress already existing lesions (in the presence of pravastatin) and the peptide also decreases brain arteriole inflammation, we undertook a study to evaluate the efficacy of oral D-4F co-administered with pravastatin on cognitive function and amyloid beta (A beta) burden in the hippocampus of APPSwe-PS1 Delta E9 mice. Three groups of male mice were administered D-4F and pravastatin, Scrambled D-4F (ScD-4F, a control peptide) and pravastatin in drinking water, while drinking water alone served as control. The escape latency in the Morris Water Maze test was significantly shorter for the D-4F+statin administered animals compared to the other two groups. While the hippocampal region of the brain was covered with 4.2+/-0.5 and 3.8+/-0.6% of A beta load in the control and ScD-4F+statin administered groups, in the D-4F+statin administered group A beta load was only 1.6+/-0.1%. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the number of activated microglia (p<0.05 vs the other two groups) and activated astrocytes (p<0.05 vs control) upon oral D-4F+statin treatment. Inflammatory markers TNFalpha and IL-1 beta levels were decreased significantly in the D-4F+statin group compared to the other two groups (for IL-1 beta p<0.01 vs the other two groups and for TNF-alpha p<0.001 vs control) and the expression of MCP-1 were also less in D-4F+statin administered group compared to the other two groups.

Three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in T2DM have now independently confirmed the HbA1c and LDL-C reductions with COL. In each of the primary studies, a significant mean treatment difference in HbA1c (-0.54%, -0.50%, and -0.54%) and LDL-C (-15.9%, -12.8%, and -16.7%) resulted from the addition of 3.75 grams/day of COL to existing metformin, insulin, or sulfonylurea-based therapy, respectively, in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on their current antidiabetic regimen. Here we report the results of a pooled analysis of data for the 1018 patients included in the three primary studies. By study end, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were significantly reduced with COL versus placebo. Triglyceride (TG) and ApoA-I were significantly increased in the COL group relative to placebo. HDL-C did not change in either group, and the between-group treatment difference was small and not significant. Results of this pooled analysis are consistent with results reported previously in each of the primary COL studies and indicate that the HbA1c and LDL-C-lowering effects of COL are consistent, occurring regardless of whether COL is added to metformin, insulin, or sulfonylurea-based therapy. In conclusion, COL represents a novel therapeutic option by significantly lowering both LDL-C and HbA1c in patients with T2DM, two important treatment goals to forestall vascular complications.",

Cell apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V staining and flow cytometry, as well as transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL). The mRNA and protein levels of caspase-3, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP)-1 and -2 were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting, respectively.Treatment with both low (0.05 mmol l(-1)) and high (0.3 mmol l(-1)) concentrations of Hcy induced apoptosis in HUVECs which was accompanied by an increased level of caspase-3 expression and activation, together with decreased cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 levels. Conversely, simvastatin upregulated c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 expression, while attenuating Hcy-induced apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. Hcy may induce HUVEC apoptosis through a pathway involving caspase-3. This induction can be partially antagonized by simvastatin, possibly through upregulation of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2.",

The addition of specific intermediates in the isoprenylation pathway reversed this effect, whereas specific targeting of enzymes responsible for prenylation mimicked the inhibitory effects of statins on Ag presentation by CD1d as well as MHC class II molecules.

If so, treating larger numbers of people at lower risk would yield greater reductions in CHD than treating smaller numbers at higher risk. High- and moderate-risk patients require evidence-based doses of high-potency statins, as adjuncts to dietary management and benefits to individuals are large and easily quantifiable in randomized trials. In low-risk patients, however, dietary modifications contribute to a public health benefit while that benefit to any individual is small. Thus, the hypothesis that modest dietary reductions in blood cholesterol have important public health benefits is easily quantifiable by extrapolation from existing data but impossible to test among randomized individuals, as the sample sizes and costs are prohibitively large.",

For moderaterisk individuals, those with 2 or more major risk factors for CAD and a Framingham risk score of 10% to 20%, the recommendation is to use a statin to lower LDL-C levels to less than 130 mg/dL. However, up to 40% of individuals who develop CAD have LDL-C levels lower than this cutoff. In 2004, the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines were updated to include an LDL-C goal of less than 100 mg/dL for individuals at moderately high risk of developing CAD. The guidelines identified several risk factors that when present would favor the use of pharmacological therapy to achieve this more aggressive LDL-C goal. This review evaluates the evidence supporting an LDL-C target of less than 100 mg/dL for moderately high-risk individuals and reviews those risk factors that when present help identify patients who would benefit from achieving this lower LDL-C goal.

The epidemiology of outcomes after stroke has been relatively less studied for several reasons, including the traditional study of populations in which rates of cardiac disease are higher than those of stroke, the heterogeneity of stroke, and the absence until recently of effective therapies. The importance of recurrent stroke, cardiac events, dementia, depression, and other vascular and nonvascular events will increase as the population ages and as more patients survive a first stroke. This article discusses the relative importance of recurrent stroke and other events after initial ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, and proven and potential risk factors for recurrent stroke. Based on growing evidence regarding the high rates of cardiovascular events after stroke, and the efficacy of statin therapy in reducing the risk of stroke as well as cardiac disease, it may be time to consider expanding the \"coronary risk equivalent\" category to include patients with stroke. Patients who have had a stroke are likely at high enough risk for subsequent events to warrant the same aggressive treatment, including statins and antihypertensive drugs, as would be given to patients with other forms of cardiovascular disease. Future clinical trials will better define the optimal management of patients after stroke.",

Clinical factors were analyzed by simple Chi-square and multivariate regression analysis to identify independent predictors for advanced CRC. We identified 1,309 male patients with a new diagnosis of CRC (mean age 69 +/- 1.1 (SE) years; 326 Statin Users, 983 Statin Non-Users).

A total of 174 consecutive patients with dental examination including radiography and coronary angiography in the same hospitalization were recruited (64.5 +/- 10.3 years, M/F: 94/80). A dentist assessed severity of periodontal status markers (bleeding on probing, probing depth >or=6 mm, teeth lost, alveolar bone resorption >half of root length by radiography and smoking status). We divided these patients into two groups according to whether they had CAD (CAD group, n = 99) or not (non-CAD group, n = 75) according to the results of coronary angiography. The composite periodontal risk scores calculated from periodontal status markers were higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (P = 0.02). The composite periodontal scores were higher in the CAD group of age <60 years old population (P = 0.03) and in the CAD group of patients with normal glucose tolerance (P = 0.04). However, the difference was not significant in the age >or=60 years old population or those with diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance. In all populations, hypertension, glucose tolerance, statin therapy, and composite of periodontal risk scores were associated with CAD. Multivariate analyses revealed statin therapy, glucose tolerance, and periodontal risk scores were independent and significant risk factors for CAD. Composite periodontal risk scores were independent and significant predictive factors for CAD.",

The current standard of care for treating hypercholesterolemia is the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, which block the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis. In widespread clinical use, statins have proven safe and effective for both primary prevention of CHD and secondary prevention of coronary events. Results from several recent clinical trials have demonstrated that increasingly aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy might offer additional protection against CHD compared with less aggressive treatment standards. While higher doses of current statin therapies are capable of achieving these more aggressive treatment goals, in certain cases statin-induced myalgia, the muscle pain or weakness that sometimes accompanies high-dose statin therapy, limits patient compliance with a treatment regimen. To address this limitation, efforts have been undertaken to develop highly hepatoselective statins that are capable of delivering best-in-class efficacy with minimized risk of dose-limiting myalgia.

Therefore, strategies to prevent CVD should be implemented at an early age, especially in populations at high risk for CVD. In addition to lifestyle interventions, these strategies include pharmacological treatment of dyslipidemia, a well-established risk factor for CVD in adults. Several lipid-lowering agents have been evaluated in children; however, long-term safety and efficacy data are lacking. As in adults, statins are the preferred pharmacological agents in pediatric practice due to excellent efficacy and tolerability, with few adverse safety outcomes observed to date.

Early diagnosis and treatment of subclinical atherosclerosis in asymptomatic patients who are at risk of developing clinically evident atherosclerosis may help prevent CHD and future coronary events. New understanding of the role of atherosclerotic plaque burden in predicting risk for CHD and the development of new technologies for evaluating coronary plaque have improved our ability to assess risk in asymptomatic patients who may have subclinical disease. Assessment technologies including coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, B-mode ultrasound, and electron-beam computed tomography have been used widely in clinical studies of statin treatment in patients with and without CHD. Results from these studies show that statins not only lower lipids but inhibit progression and, in some instances, lead to regression of coronary plaques.

    "151": "These studies explore the connections between simvastatin, Rac1, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways in cultured vascular endothelial cells and in arterial preparations isolated from statin-treated mice. In addition to their prominent effects on lipoprotein metabolism, statins can regulate the small GTPase Rac1, and may also affect the phosphorylation of the ubiquitous AMPK. We explored pathways of statin-modulated Rac1 and AMPK activation both in arterial preparations from statin-treated mice as well as in cultured endothelial cells. We treated adult mice with simvastatin daily for 2 weeks and then harvested and analyzed arterial preparations. Simvastatin treatment of mice led to a significant increase in AMPK and LKB1 phosphorylation and to a decrease in protein kinase A activity relative to control animals, associated with a marked increase in Rac1 activation. Exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells to simvastatin for 24 h strikingly increased GTP-bound Rac1 and led to increased phosphorylation of AMPK as well as the AMPK kinase LKB1. These responses to simvastatin were blocked by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not by farnesyl pyrophosphate. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of AMPK abrogated simvastatin-induced Rac1 activation and LKB1 phosphorylation. Importantly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the key AMPK kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta, completely blocked simvastatin-induced endothelial cell migration and also abrogated statin-promoted phosphorylation of AMPK and LKB1, as did pharmacological inhibition with the specific calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase beta inhibitor STO-609. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rac1 completely blocked simvastatin-induced LKB1 phosphorylation, but without affecting simvastatin-induced AMPK phosphorylation. These findings establish a key role for simvastatin in activation of a novel Rac1-dependent signaling pathway in the vascular wall.", 
    "152": "Statins have become the mainstay of hypercholesterolemia treatment. Despite a seemingly clear rationale behind their use, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, these compounds have been shown to elicit a variety of unanticipated and elusive effects and side effects in vivo. Among the most frequently noted side effects of statin treatment are elevations in liver enzymes. Here, we report our finding that atorvastatin, cerivastatin, and lovastatin at clinically common concentrations induce a selective, differential loss of selenoprotein expression in cultured human HepG2 hepatocytes. The primarily affected selenoprotein was glutathione peroxidase (GPx), whose biosynthesis, steady-state expression level, and catalytic activity were significantly reduced with 10 to 100 nM concentrations of the different compounds. Messenger RNA levels of GPx1 and GPx4 were unaffected by statin treatment, pointing at a post-transcriptional mechanism of selenoprotein suppression. Although statins at selenoprotein-modulatory doses were not cytotoxic by themselves, they induced a significantly increased sensitivity of the cells to peroxides, an effect that was largely reversible by supraphysiological concentrations of selenite. We conclude that statins inhibit the expression of inducible selenoproteins by preventing the mevalonate-dependent maturation of the single human selenocysteine-tRNA and may thereby evoke an increased vulnerability of the liver to secondary toxins. Selenoprotein modulation might constitute an important mechanism of statins to bring forth their clinical effects.",

Furthermore, 'pleiotropic effects' including immunomodulation have been demonstrated by statins following transplantation.

Although speculative, both of these agents could potentially offer benefits to the transplant patient by modulating important components of the adaptive immune system. CD4+ cells in particular are implicated in both CAV and rejection processes.", 
    "177": "A correlation exists between circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence from clinical trials indicates that reducing LDL-C levels can result in beneficial clinical outcomes in patients at risk of CVD and in high-risk patients with clinical symptoms of CVD. Lipid-lowering agents, of which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the most effective, protect against the vascular changes seen in the development of atherosclerotic plaque formation. Clinical trials assessing the effects of statins on coronary atherosclerosis using quantitative coronary angiography or intravascular ultrasound showed that statins can reduce progression or even cause regression of atherosclerotic plaque. This improvement of vascular structure after statin treatment is correlated with reductions in LDL-C levels. This appears to be the principal mechanism by which statin therapy reduces cardiovascular risk, with emerging evidence for statin-mediated changes in high-density lipoprotein and C-reactive protein levels contributing to modification of the atherosclerotic plaque.",

Titration schedules and time frames to attain a regimen of simvastatin 80 mg/day were available for 154 (73%) subjects. Titrations ranged from 1 to 8 and averaged 2.3 +/- 1.3 titrations per patient (median titrations = 2) over 1 month to 8.4 years. On follow-up, 47 patients experienced 80 cardiovascular-related outcomes. The average time to titration to maximum dose of statin therapy was longer for patients who experienced a cardiac event than for those who did not (3.5 +/- 2.2 vs 2.1 +/- 1.8 years; p = 0.0004). After accounting for other risk factors, the titration period was still significantly related to the presence of a cardiac event (p = 0.0060, odds ratio per month increase in the titration period 1.3, 95% CI 1.08, 1.58).",

Although HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy can reduce no-reflow, little is known about its effect on no-reflow in patients with hyperglycemia. In the present study, we investigated whether pretreatment with a statin could reduce no-reflow in patients with hyperglycemia, who underwent primary coronary intervention for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).", 
    "183": "A total of 259 consecutive patients who underwent primary angioplasty for a first AMI were studied. Blood glucose and creatinine kinase levels were measured on admission. All patients underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography and electrocardiographic analysis just after admission. No-reflow was defined as a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade <3. Hyperglycemia was defined as a blood glucose level >or=10 mmol/L. Statin administration prior to admission was determined by detailed interview or information in the medical records.",

The incidence of no-reflow was significantly greater in patients with hyperglycemia compared with no hyperglycemia. A multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that hyperglycemia on admission was an independent predictor of no-reflow. Among the 154 patients with hyperglycemia, there were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between patients who received statin pretreatment and those who did not; however, hyperlipidemia occurred in a greater number of the patients who did not receive statin pretreatment. The 40 patients with hyperglycemia who received statins before admission had a lower incidence of no-reflow than those who did not receive statin pretreatment (5% and 25.4%; p < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that absence of statin pretreatment was a significant predictor of no-reflow in patients with hyperglycemia, along with ejection fraction on admission, initial TIMI 0 flow, number of Q waves, and anterior AMI.",

Given their therapeutic efficacy, statins are believed to be the strongest class of agents in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. Moreover, besides decreasing total cholesterol and C-LDL levels, numerous fundamental and clinical researches suggest that statins also have an antiinflammatory effect. Inflammation is closely related to the production of oxygen-derived reactive species (ROS). The antioxidant effects of statins associated with their ability to block the formation and/or action of ROS may add up their therapeutic efficacy. Within this context, the present paper presents data in literature related to the effect of statins on the expression and activity of NAD(P)H oxidase, activity of the enzymes involved in the antioxidative defence (SOD, GPx, catalase, paraoxonase), and their ability to act as free radical scavengers and oxidized-LDL inhibitors. By their antioxidant properties statins may decrease the atherogenic potential of lipoproteins.",

    "207": "Vascular calcification is associated with the mortality of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) . Susceptibility to vascular calcification is genetically determined and actively regulated by diverse inducers and inhibitors. One of these inducers, hyperphosphatemia, promotes vascular calcification and is a nontraditional risk factor for CVD mortality in CKD patients. Hyperphosphatemia promotes vascular calcification in part by promoting VSMCs to undergo an osteochondrogenic phenotype change through a mechanism requiring sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporters. Recent randomized clinical trials showed that lowering serum phosphate levels with a non-calcium containing phosphate binder slows progression of vascular calcification in ESRD patients. Moreover, calcimimetics reduce arterial remodeling and calcification in rats with subtotal nephrectomy. Whether this difference will also be found in humans and will ultimately translate into less CV events in calcimimetics treated uremic patients is for a matter for speculation. Calcium and phosphate load are an important driver of vascular calcification."
