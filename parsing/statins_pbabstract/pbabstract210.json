    "0": "Statins are widely used to treat dyslipidemia. Effects of statins in addition to low-density lipoprotein lowering include altered platelet aggregation, requiring drug uptake into platelets. Possible candidates for mediating intraplatelet accumulation of statins include members of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide family such as OATP2B1 (SLCO2B1), a high-affinity uptake transporter for atorvastatin. Therefore, we analyzed OATP expression, localization, and function in human platelets. OATP2B1, but not OATP1B1, was detected in platelets and megakaryocytes on transcript and protein levels. Protein localization was almost exclusively confined to the plasma membrane. Moreover, we could demonstrate significant inhibition of estrone sulfate uptake into platelets by atorvastatin as well as direct transport of atorvastatin into platelets using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. As a consequence of OATP2B1-mediated uptake of atorvastatin, we observed significant atorvastatin-mediated reduction of thrombin-induced Ca(2+) mobilization in platelets (37.3 +/- 6.7% of control at 15 microM atorvastatin), mechanistically explainable by reduced lipid modification of signal proteins. This effect was reversed by addition of mevalonate. Finally, we demonstrated expression of HMG-CoA reductase, the primary target of atorvastatin, in platelet cytosol. In conclusion, OATP2B1 is an uptake transporter expressed in platelets and is involved in statin-mediated alteration of platelet aggregation.",

This is mainly due to cardiovascular toxicity reported in individuals with a personal history of sporadic adenomas. Aspirin and sulindac have also repeatedly demonstrated efficacy in this setting. However, due to increased risk of associated GI toxicity their benefit will have to be weighed against their risk.

Using a mouse model of recurrent spontaneous miscarriages (DBA/2-mated CBA/J mice) that shares features with human recurrent miscarriage and fetal growth restriction, we identified tissue factor (TF) as an essential participating factor in placental and fetal injury. We have previously shown that C5a releases antiangiogenic molecule sFlt-1 in monocytes that causes defective placental development and fetal death in DBA/2-mated CBA/J mice. In this study, we found that TF not only activates the coagulation pathway, but it also mediates sFlt-1 release in monocytes causing defective placental development and fetal death. Blockade of TF with a monoclonal antibody inhibited sFlt-1 release, prevented the pathological activation of the coagulation pathway, restored placental blood flow, prevented placental oxidative stress, and rescued pregnancies. We also demonstrated that pravastatin, by down-regulating TF expression on monocytes and trophoblasts, prevented placental damage and protected pregnancies in DBA/2-mated CBA/J mice. These studies indicate that TF is an important mediator in fetal death and growth restriction and that statins may be a good treatment for women with recurrent miscarriages and IUGR.",

Several cardiovascular end points were evaluated, including the occurrence of a first major coronary event (MCE; nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease death, or resuscitated cardiac arrest), the primary end point of the trial, and occurrence of any cardiovascular event (MCE, stroke, revascularization, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, and peripheral artery disease). Although there were no significant interactions between age and treatment, the magnitude of effect in favor of atorvastatin was higher in younger versus older patients (occurrence of first MCE, hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66 to 0.98; and HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.15, respectively; occurrence of any cardiovascular (CV) event, HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; and HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, respectively). These results were likely influenced by adherence, which was lower in older patients and those receiving atorvastatin compared with those receiving simvastatin. Rates of any reported serious adverse event were higher in older patients, but did not differ between the 2 statin groups. In conclusion, except for any CV events in the older group, significant reductions in primary and secondary end points were observed only in patients <65 years of age. The safety of atorvastatin (80 mg) and simvastatin (20 to 40 mg) was similar in patients aged <65 and >65 years with stable coronary disease.",

Fifty-eight individuals were treated in the year before, and 72 patients treated in the year after, the introduction of a 2week course of 40mg/day pravastatin therapy for SAH. Statins did not result in reduced TCD velocities, clinical or angiographic vasospasm, or improvements in global outcome at the time of hospital discharge.

The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are a high plasma triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentration and increased concentration of small dense LDL-cholesterol particles. The lipid changes associated with diabetes mellitus are attributed to increased free fatty acid flux secondary to insulin resistance. The availability of multiple lipid-lowering drugs and supplements provides new opportunities for patients to achieve target lipid levels. However, the variety of therapeutic options poses a challenge in the prioritization of drug therapy. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia is not increased in patients with diabetes mellitus, but mortality from coronary heart disease increases exponentially as a function of serum cholesterol levels, and lowering of cholesterol with statins reduces diabetic patients' relative cardiovascular risk. Although drug therapy for dyslipidemia must be individualized, most people with diabetes mellitus are candidates for statin therapy, and often need treatment with multiple agents to achieve therapeutic goals.",

Their proven benefit in prevention of cardiovascular events is driven by their ability to markedly reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Recent analyses have provided insight into the relationship between statin-induced reductions in LDL-C and risk of rhabdomyolysis, liver toxicity, and cancer. Risk of statin-associated elevated liver enzymes and rhabdomyolysis is not related to the magnitude of LDL-C lowering. Instead, drug- and dose-specific effects of statins are more important determinants of liver and muscle toxicity than magnitude of LDL-C lowering. Furthermore, although there is an inverse association between LDL-C and cancer risk in both statin-treated and comparable control cohorts, statin therapy, despite significantly reducing LDL-C, is not associated with an increased risk of cancer.", 
    "59": "B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac hormone, which plays a major role in body fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. Produced by cardiac ventricles, its expression is highly regulated by various mediators. Canine cardiac fibroblasts have been identified as a source of BNP. Cardiac fibroblasts are key regulators of myocardial structure and function. We treated cultured human adult cardiac fibroblasts (HACF) with 2000 U/ml tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 200 U/ml interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) or 50 ng/ml transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in the presence or absence of 500 nM fluvastatin. N-terminal pro-BNP (Nt-proBNP) concentration was determined by a competitive enzyme immunoassay. RealTime polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) was performed to investigate changes in BNP mRNA expression. Nt-proBNP peptide was present in the conditioned media of HACF and incubation with fluvastatin significantly reduced Nt-proBNP peptide levels. Treatment of HACF with TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha or TGF-beta significantly increased Nt-proBNP levels compared with untreated cells. This effect was completely abolished in the presence of fluvastatin. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed these changes at the level of mRNA expression. Our data suggest that cardiac fibroblasts are a potential source of BNP in the human heart. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, associated with ventricular dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis, seem to be major inducers of BNP production in cardiac fibroblasts. This effect can be reverted by a statin. Based on our data, we speculate that elevated plasma BNP levels might not only reflect increased myocardial stretch but also inflammatory and remodelling processes. A possible benefit of statin-induced reduction in BNP production requires further studies.", 
    "60": "Statins are commonly used drugs in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. There are many adverse effects of statins on skeletal muscle, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the effects of low dose (20 mg/kg) simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, on rat EDL muscle (extensor digitorum longus muscle) were investigated at the molecular level using FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared) spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy allows us rapid and sensitive determination of functional groups belonging to proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids simultaneously. The results revealed that simvastatin treatment induces a significant decrease in lipid, nucleic acid, protein and glycogen content. A significant increase in the lipid/protein and nucleic acid/protein ratios was also obtained with simvastatin treatment. Furthermore, an increase in lipid order and membrane fluidity was detected. A decrease in the bandwidth of the amide I band and shifting of the position of this band to higher frequency values in treated muscle indicates structural changes in proteins. Detailed secondary structure analysis of the amide I band revealed a significant increase in antiparallel and aggregated beta-sheet, random coil structure and a significant decrease in beta-sheet structure, which indicates protein denaturation.",

Increased level of products of lipid peroxidation and cholesterol-enriched lipid domains in the plasma membrane can favorthe malignant transformation of cells. An effective chemopreventive agent with hypolipaedemic effect will be worthwhile to intervene early in the process of carcinogenesis to eliminate the pre-malignant cells. Apoptotic promoting and antitumor activities of a HMG-Co A reductase inhibitor, atorvatstain were investigated. The antitumor activity was evaluated using Daltons' Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) cell line transplanted ascites tumor model in mice. Proapoptotic activity was evaluated in DLA cell line induced ascites animals after the treatment of atorvastatin (4 and 16 mg/kg, i.p). Apoptosis was analyzed morphologically by staining with giemsa and biochemically by observing the laddering of DNA in agarose gel electrophoresis. In vitro short term cytotoxic activity of atorvatstain was studied by trypan blue dye exclusion method. Doxorubicin was used as the reference standard. Atorvastatin significantly (P < 0.01) inhibited the ascites tumor growth at 16 mg/kg body wt (i.p). The percent increase in life span (%ILS) in the 16 mg/kg treated group was 41.1%. Single dose of atorvastatin (16 mg/kg body wt) was also effective to promote the apoptosis of DLA cells in the ascites tumor bearing mice that was evident from the multiple fragmentation of DNA in agarose gel electrophoresis. Further the morphological analysis of DLA cells aspirated from the atorvastatin treated ascites tumor bearing animals showed 36.34 +/- 6.78% apoptotic cells compared to the control animals (10.50 +/- 3.53%). Concentration of atorvastatin required for the 50% of the cytotoxicity was 30 +/- 2 microg/ml. Results of the study concluded that the antitumor activity of atorvastatin may be due to its proapoptotic and cytotoxic activities. These pleiotropic activities of the hypolipedaemic drug atorvastatin suggest its possible use as a cancer chemopreventive agent.",

Recently, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) were shown to activate PPARalpha and PPARgamma in various cells but no studies of their effects in GBEC have been conducted. The objective of this study was, therefore, to determine the effects of statins on PPAR and ABCA1 expression and the anti-inflammatory effect of statins in GBEC. Canine GBEC were cultured on Petri dishes. Expression of the proteins PPARalpha, PPARgamma, and ABCA1 was measured by western blotting analysis after treatment with simvastatin, pravastatin, NO-pravastatin, PPARalpha ligand, or PPARgamma ligand in the culture media. Expression of ABCA1 and LXRalpha mRNAs was estimated by RT-PCR. Expression of TNFalpha mRNA was measured by RT-PCR after 24 h pre-treatment with the statins, preceding 1 h of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) loading. Simvastatin, pravastatin, and NO-pravastatin increased expression of the proteins PPARalpha, PPARgamma, and ABCA1, and expression of the mRNA of ABCA1 and LXRalpha in GBEC. Pre-treatment with simvastatin, pravastatin, and NO-pravastatin suppressed the production of TNFalpha mRNA induced by LPS. In conclusion, statins probably contribute to the preservation of GBEC function by activation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma, which have anti-inflammatory effects by suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and ABCA1 activation mediated by LXRalpha, which prevents the accumulation of cholesterol in GBEC.", 
    "79": "Statin treatment has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer disease and decreased amyloid deposition in mouse models. No animal studies have reported effects of statins on tau aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease that correlate with dementia. We investigated the effect of statins on NFTs in a transgenic mouse tauopathy model and found the following: 1) 1-month treatment with the blood-brain barrier-permeable agent simvastatin in normocholesterolemic aged mice significantly reduced the NFT burden and decreased lectin-positive microglia; 2) simvastatin significantly decreased NFTs and improved T-maze performance in young animals treated for 8 months; 3) treatment of hypercholesterolemic mice for 5 months with blood-brain barrier-impermeable atorvastatin markedly reduced the NFT burden and decreased lectin-positive microglia; 4) nonstatin cholesterol-lowering strategies showed a modest NFT decrease compared with statin treatment; and 5) there was a positive correlation between microglial and NFT burden (r = 0.8). Together, these results suggest that statins reduce NFT burden irrespective of blood-brain barrier permeability at both early and late ages in long- and short-term treatment paradigms and under normocholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic conditions. The decrease in microglia, coupled with the limited effect of nonstatin cholesterol lowering, suggests that the anti-NFT effect of statins may be related to their anti-inflammatory and not necessarily to their cholesterol-lowering properties. Statins may provide therapy against NFTs in tauopathies, particularly when NFTs are the major neuropathologic component.",

Flow cytometric analysis after treatment showed significant decreases in total lymphocytes, and in surface antigens of CD16+56 and CD8+(CD28+) on leukocytes, CD11c on granulocytes, and a significant increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio (p<0.05). Compared to the control group, the mean baseline values of fluorescence density (FD) of CD14, CD11b, CD11c, and CD63 on monocytes, and CD11b and CD11c on granulocytes were significantly higher in patients with MS (p<0.05). Following fluvastatin treatment, there were significant decreases in the mean FD of CD3 on lymphocytes, and of CD11b and CD11c on both monocytes and granulocytes (p<0.05); of these, all FD values were similar to those in the control group (p>0.05).",

In the kidney, the major target of AII action is the glomerular mesangial cell, where its hemodynamic and proinflammatory action contributes to renal injury. AII action is mediated by several types of cell receptors. Among those, the AT1 receptor has been best studied using specific AII receptor blockers (ARBs). These agents have emerged as major new modalities in the prevention and amelioration of renal disease where the ARB renoprotective anti-inflammatory properties could be more important than previously appreciated. Like the ARBs, statins may also modulate inflammatory responses that are renoprotective and complement their cholesterol-lowering effects.", 
    "88": "The aim of this project was to (i) identify a repertoire of proinflammatory mesangial cell AII-inducible mRNAs; (ii) determine if the AII-induced proinflammatory mRNA responses depend on ambient glucose, and (iii) test the anti-inflammatory effectiveness of an ARB, valsartan, either alone or in combination with a statin, simvastatin.", 
    "89": "Using high-density microarrays and real-time PCR we identified several AII-inducible proinflammatory mesangial genes that exhibited augmented mRNA responses in high-glucose milieu. Valsartan blocked the AII-induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory genes (i.e. MCP-1, LIF and COX-2) maintained in normal and high glucose. These observations add to the mounting evidence that ARBs have anti-inflammatory effects in the kidney, a beneficial effect that may be more important in protecting renal function in diabetic patients. While simvastatin inhibited expression of some mRNAs encoding chemokines/cytokines, it enhanced expression of mRNA encoding COX-2, a key mediator of inflammation. Thus, the non-cholesterol effects of statins on inflammatory responses appear complex.",

    "93": "Administered subcutaneously, D-4F or L-4F are equally efficacious, but only D-4F is orally efficacious because of digestion of L-4F by gut proteases. Orally administering niclosamide (a chlorinated salicylanilide used as a molluscicide, antihelminthic, and lampricide) in temporal proximity to oral L-4F (but not niclosamide alone) in apoE null mice resulted in significant improvement (P < 0.001) in the HDL-inflammatory index (HII), which measures the ability of HDL to inhibit LDL-induced monocyte chemotactic activity in endothelial cell cultures. Oral administration of L-[113-122]apoJ with niclosamide also resulted in significant improvement (P < 0.001) in HII. Oral administration of niclosamide and L-4F together with pravastatin to female apoE null mice at 9.5 months of age for six months significantly reduced aortic sinus lesion area (P = 0.02), en face lesion area (P = 0.033), and macrophage lesion area (P = 0.02) compared with pretreatment, indicating lesion regression. In contrast, lesions were significantly larger in mice receiving only niclosamide and pravastatin or L-4F and pravastatin (P < 0.001). In vitro niclosamide and L-4F tightly associated rendering the peptide resistant to trypsin digestion. Niclosamide itself did not inhibit trypsin activity. The combination of niclosamide with apolipoprotein mimetic peptides appears to be a promising method for oral delivery of these peptides.", 
    "94": "Neuroblastoma cell lines are commonly used as models to study neuronal differentiation, as they retain the capacity to differentiate into a neuronal-like phenotype. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is essential for neuronal differentiation during development, and cholesterol-containing lipid-rafts are important for RTK signaling. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors of the statin family impair cholesterol biosynthesis and are in widespread clinical use for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It is of great clinical interest that statin treatment also correlates with a lower incidence of malignancies. We found that mevastatin triggered neurite outgrowth of neuroblastoma cells and examined the responsible signaling pathways. Treatment of Neuro2a cells with mevastatin for 24 hr induced neurite outgrowth associated with up-regulation of the neuronal marker protein NeuN. Interestingly, we found that mevastatin triggered phosphorylation of the key kinases epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ERK1/2, and Akt/protein kinase B. Inhibition of EGFR, PI3K, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade blocked mevastatin-induced neurite outgrowth. Moreover, add-back experiments of cell-permeable cholesterol precursors indicated that farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins play a major role in statin-induced neurite outgrowth. Taken together, our results provide the first mechanistic insight into statin-triggered signaling pathways that lead to neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells. Surprisingly, we revealed that mevastatin triggered the phosphorylation of the EGFR and that this was because of the inhibition of farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins. We propose that members of the large family of farnesylated or geranylgeranylated small GTPases (such as Rabs or Rap1) regulating the trafficking and signaling of EGFR might be responsible for the statin-induced effects on EGFR signaling.", 
    "95": "The statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) were proven to be effective antilipid agents against cardiovascular disease. Recent reports demonstrate an anticancer effect induced by the statins through inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, or inhibition of angiogenesis. These effects are due to suppression of the mevalonate pathway leading to depletion of various downstream products that play an essential role in cell cycle progression, cell signaling, and membrane integrity. Recent evidence suggests a shared genomic fingerprint between embryonic stem cells, cancer cells, and cancer stem cells. Activation targets of NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and c-MYC are more frequently overexpressed in certain tumors. In the absence of bona fide cancer stem cell lines, human embryonic stem cells, which have similar properties to cancer and cancer stem cells, have been an excellent model throwing light on the anticancer affects of various putative anticancer agents. It was shown that key cellular functions in karyotypically abnormal colorectal and ovarian cancer cells and human embryonic stem cells are inhibited by the statins and this is mediated via a suppression of this stemness pathway. The strategy for treatment of cancers may thus be the targeting of a putative cancer stem cell within the tumor with specific agents such as the statins with or without chemotherapy. The statins may thus play a dual prophylactic role as a lipid-lowering drug for the prevention of heart disease and as an anticancer agent to prevent certain cancers. This review examines the relationship between the statins, stem cells, and certain cancers.", 
    "96": "Retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) has recently been suggested as a good biomarker for insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. With this study, we wanted to investigate the effect of pioglitazone (PIO) and simvastatin (SIMVA) on insulin resistance and RBP4 plasma concentrations in nondiabetic patients with metabolic syndrome and increased risk for cardiovascular complications. The prospective, parallel, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed with 125 nondiabetic patients with increased cardiovascular risk (78 females, 47 males, age (mean+/-STD): 58.6+/-7.8 years, BMI: 30.8+/-4.2 kg/m (2)). They were randomized to either receive PIO (45 mg)+placebo, SIMVA (40 mg)+placebo, or PIO+SIMVA for 3 months. Key outcome measures were the HOMA (IR)-Score, an oral glucose tolerance test, adiponectin, hsCRP, and RBP4 at baseline and endpoint. No correlation could be detected between the HOMA (IR) values or the impaired fasting glucose tolerance status and RBP-4. Treatment with PIO alone or in combination with SIMVA resulted in a significant improvement of the HOMA (IR)-Score and the adiponectin values, while no change in HOMA (IR) and a decrease in adiponectin (p<0.05) were observed with SIMVA monotherapy. Reductions of hsCRP were seen in all three treatment arms (p<0.001). No changes of the plasma RBP4 concentrations were observed in any of the treatment groups (PIO: 35.6+/-7.2/36.3+/-8.7 ng/ml, PIO+SIMVA: 36.5+/-10.8/36.5+/-8 ng/ml, SIMVA: 36.1+/-8.1/36.6+/-11.1 ng/ml, all n.s. vs. baseline). Despite a partial or comprehensive improvement in insulin resistance and/or cardiovascular risk indicators in all treatment arms, no change in RBP4-levels could be observed. The regulation of RBP4 expression and secretion occurs through biochemical pathways independent from those influenced by pioglitazone or simvastatin.",

We aimed to investigate the effects of high doses of immunoglobulin in addition to these combinations in rats with adriamycin-induced nephrosis. The study included 40 rats allocated into five groups: control, nephrotic syndrome without treatment, dual therapy (DT) with enalapril + losartan, triple therapy (TT) with enalapril + losartan + simvastatin, and quadruple therapy (QT) with enalapril + losartan + simvastatin + a high dose of immunoglobulin. The proteinuria levels were not statistically different between DT, TT and QT groups at weeks 5, 8, 12 and 16. At week 16, serum creatinine levels in the QT group were significantly lower than those in the control, DT and TT groups. The glomerulosclerosis index in the DT group was significantly lower than in the TT and QT groups. The scores for interstitial fibrosis and TGF-beta staining were similar among treatment groups. In conclusion, we showed that quadruple therapy including immunoglobulin had a beneficial effect on renal function in the late phase, but it had no additional effects in reducing proteinuria or in glomerulosclerosis score in experimental nephrotic syndrome. Further studies with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) and immunoglobulin combinations would offer some benefits in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome.",

RT-PCR and Western blotting were employed to detect liver leptin mRNA receptor expression and P-JAK2, P-STAT3 expression levels in the liver respectively. The results showed that puerarin significantly decreased the TG, TC content in liver of the non-alcoholic fatty disease rats, ameliorated steatosis in liver, lowered liver inflammatory reaction, decreased leptin level in serum, and enhanced the expression of leptin receptor mRNA and P-JAK2/P-STAT3 level. All the results demonstrated that puerarin can exhibit therapeutic effect on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by improving leptin signal transduction through JAK2/STAT3 pathways.",

Wistar rats were fed a control (18% casein) or protein-restricted (9% casein) diet throughout pregnancy. At weaning, a subset of the protein-restricted group was given atorvastatin (10 mg/kg per day) in the drinking water. At 145 days of age, offspring were euthanized by CO(2) inhalation. Plasma samples were collected for markers of inflammation, vascular reactivity of the thoracic aorta, and small mesenteric arteries were assessed on the wire myograph, and tissues were snap frozen for molecular biology analysis. Thoracic aorta endothelial-dependent vasodilatation was attenuated in the male offspring from both protein-restricted groups compared with controls (P<0.05) but was similar in females (P value not significant). Endothelial-dependent dilatation of mesenteric arteries was attenuated in male and female protein-restricted offspring (P<0.05) and was corrected by atorvastatin. Maternal protein restriction increased plasma inflammatory markers granulocyte chemotactic protein, lipocalin-2, and beta(2)-microglobulin in male and C-reactive protein in female offspring (P<0.05). Atorvastatin had no effect on inflammatory markers in the males but restored C-reactive protein to control levels in the females (P<0.05).

The development of myopathy was not associated with the accumulation of statins in skeletal muscle. For each statin exposure was equivalent in muscles irrespective of their fibre-type sensitivity to myopathy. The low amount of each statin in skeletal muscle relative to the liver does not support a significant role for transporters in the disposition of statins in skeletal muscle.

In particular, in the present overview we focused the attention on a neglected aspect of the pleiotropic functions of some lipophilic statins, suggesting that the possible mechanism of matrix metalloproteinase downregulation arises from prolonged lowering of circulating cholesterol.

Pyloric ligation was performed for the collection of gastric juice, and gastric ulceration was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of indomethacin (30 mg/kg). Gastric juice parameters (total acid output, pepsin activity and mucin concentration) were determined. The stomachs tissues were used for determination of gastric mucosal lipid peroxides, superoxide dismutase, catalase, total nitrites and prostaglandin E(2) levels. Pretreatment with simvastatin (10 mg/kg, orally, for 2 weeks) caused significant reduction in gastric mucosal lesions and lipid peroxides associated with a significant increase in gastric juice mucin concentration. Simvastatin significantly increased the gastric mucosal total nitrite and prostaglandin E(2) levels. Additionally, simvastatin attenuated the elevations in gastric mucosal superoxide dismutase observed with indomethacin. The gastroprotective effect afforded by simvastatin was significantly augmented by coadministration with L-arginine (a nitric oxide precursor) and inhibited by coadministration with L-NAME (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor). Results confirm a gastroprotective effect for simvastatin, and indicate that the anti-ulcer effect of simvastatin is mediated by scavenging free radicals, increasing nitric oxide and prostaglandin E(2) levels, and increasing gastric juice mucin production. We conclude that simvastatin represents a more suitable antihyperlipidemic therapy for patients who are at risk of gastric ulcers that were induced by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).",

We assessed the reduction of monocyte adhesion to cultured endothelium between different-dose groups and the relationship to metabolic syndrome. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly decreased after 40-mg pravastatin treatment (-23.3% +/- 3.7%, P < .001 and -28.8% +/- 3.0%, P < .001), and the reductions were greater than those in the 10-mg group (P = .041 and P = .045, respectively). There was no significant difference in monocyte adhesion between high-dose and low-dose pravastatin treatment. When all subjects were divided into an improvement group and a no improvement group, according to the median of change percentage of monocyte adhesion after pravastatin treatment, there were significantly more subjects with metabolic syndrome in the no improvement than the improvement group (6 vs 1 person, P =.024). Using logistic regression analysis, metabolic syndrome, rather than dose effect of pravastatin, was an independent predictor of interaction between monocytes and endothelium (95% confidence interval = 0.001-0.865, P = .041).

Antecedent studies reported that statins could increase bone formation in vitro in cell lineages and primary cultured marrow stromal cells (MSCs) from juvenile mice. MSCs maintain the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages in adult life, but a decline in the stemness potential with aging has been recognized, which results in reduced osteogenesis and increased adipogenesis in the bone marrow. Thus, we assessed the effect of simvastatin on osteoblastic and adipocytic differentiation of MSCs from aging rats, 18 months of age. Simvastatin, added into culture medium with a low dose of dexamethasone, enhanced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and staining, increased the gene expression of ALP and osteocalcin (OC), and promoted mineralization in a dose-dependent fashion. Simultaneously, simvastatin also decreased Oil Red O staining and inhibited the gene expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR gamma 2) in a dose-dependent fashion. Significant effects were observed at 10(-6) M and 10(-7) M simvastatin (p < 0.05).

Nevertheless statins up-regulate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, required for HCV cell entry, and the closely related scavenger receptors SRBI and CD36; moreover they reduce class II major histocompatibility complex expression on antigen presenting cell, modulating T-cell activation. In vivo LDL levels have been identified as prognostic indicator of sustained viral response to IFN in patients with HCV infection, suggesting that lipid-lowering agents might conversely favour HCV entry into the hepatocytes and translate into higher viral replication. We evaluated the effect of fluvastatin on HCV-RNA levels, CD36 expression and T-cell homeostasis in HCV-RNA positive patients. HCV-RNA was measured at baseline and after 4 weeks in 42 HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients, randomized to receive either fluvastatin 80 mg qd or no treatment. CD36 expression and markers of T-cell activation were evaluated by means of flow cytometry. Plasma interleukin (IL)-10, IFN-gamma and IL-7 were measured by ELISA. Serum cholesterol and LDL decreased significantly in the treatment group (P = 0.0001 and 0.01, respectively). Surprisingly a significant increase of HCV-RNA levels was seen after 4 weeks of fluvastatin (P = 0.03). The percentages of naive/activated/apoptotic cells and CD36 expression remained unchanged. Fluvastatin did not inhibit HCV-RNA replication in vivo; conversely we observed a significant increase of HCV-RNA levels. CD36 expression on monocytes were not up-regulated by statins as previously reported in vitro. The correlation between HCV infectivity, oxidized-LDL receptor and statins in HCV infection need further evaluation.",

    "187": "In Western countries, chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) has a prevalence of 3-4%. The aims of treatment of chronic CAD are (1) improvement of quality of life by preventing anginal pain, by maintaining exercise capability, and by reducing anxiety; (2) decrease of cardiovascular morbidity, especially by avoiding myocardial infarction and development of heart failure; (3) reduction of mortality. These goals can be achieved by (a) cardiovascular risk reduction, especially management of risk factors, (b) optimal medical therapy, (c) coronary revascularization, (d) periods of rehabilitation, and (e) outpatient long-term observation and treatment. The patient has a good chance to improve the natural course of his disease by changing his lifestyle. In this regard, physical exercise, weight reduction and smoking cessation have to be mentioned first. Furthermore, the cardiovascular risk may significantly be diminished by adequate treatment of hyperlipoproteinemia: lowering of plasma LDL cholesterol levels in patients with chronic CAD is associated with a retarded progression of atherosclerosis as well as a decrease of cardiovascular events by 30-40% and lower mortality (by up to 34%). In patients with CAD and/or type 2 diabetes, statin therapy leads to a significant improvement of prognosis independent of the basal value of LDL cholesterol. Improved diet and adequate medical therapy may also result in diminished cardiovascular risk. By means of physical activity, mortality and morbidity of CAD can also be significantly reduced. The antianginal medication in patients with chronic CAD consists of nitrates, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In order to prevent myocardial infarction and death (secondary prevention), antiplatelet agents, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, as well as cholesterol-lowering drugs are applied. In this paper, the guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology and the NVL-KHK (German) guidelines regarding prevention, medical therapy and coronary artery revascularization procedures are summarized. Do the guidelines reflect daily practice? To answer this question, the following topics are discussed: (1) Management of risk factors with respect to available guidelines, (2) missing evidence from randomized controlled trials for medical therapy options widely used in clinical practice, (3) guideline-compliant use or underuse of diagnostic assessment, medical therapy and revascularization procedures, (4) gender bias in indications for percutaneous coronary interventions and in the use of investigations/evidence-based medical therapy, and (5) nonadherence to existing guidelines.",

Based on these guidelines, diabetes mellitus is regarded from the outset to be a cardiovascular disease, whose life-threatening complications myocardial infarction and stroke can only be avoided by an interdisciplinary concerted action. The most important information of these guidelines for the interdisciplinary cooperation of primary-care physicians, diabetologists and cardiologists are the postulations that patients with the main diagnosis diabetes mellitus with or without known CVD should, at regular intervals, be referred to a cardiologist, and patients with the main diagnosis CVD with or without diabetes mellitus should, at regular intervals, be referred to a diabetologist. Of fundamental importance is the prevention of diabetes and CVD by a comprehensive lifestyle modification including smoking cessation, regular physical activity and weight control, flanked by an evidence-based drug therapy. Within the framework of a multimodal risk management, an optimal antihypertensive therapy of a concomitant elevated blood pressure; a statin therapy in case of elevated LDL cholesterol or regardless of an elevated LDL in proven CVD; ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or beta-blockers in case of heart failure; and an anticoagulant therapy for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation all have class I recommendations. Concerning the preferred coronary revascularization procedure in diabetics, today no rigid general recommendation can be given in favor of or against coronary bypass surgery, or in favor of or against percutaneous coronary intervention. The decision for a specific revascularization procedure should, in any case, be based on a detailed analysis of the individual coronary anatomy.",

    "207": "About half of people with cancer are treated with radiation therapy; however, normal tissue toxicity still remains a dose-limiting factor for this treatment. The skin response to ionizing radiation may involve multiple inflammatory outbreaks. The endothelium is known to play a critical role in radiation-induced vascular injury. Furthermore, endothelial dysfunction reflects a decreased availability of nitric oxide. Statins have been reported to preserve endothelial function through their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, wild type and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)(-/-) mice were subjected to dorsal skin irradiation and treated with pravastatin for 28 days. We demonstrated that pravastatin has a therapeutic effect on skin lesions and abolishes radiation-induced vascular functional activation by decreasing interactions between leukocytes and endothelium. Pravastatin limits the radiation-induced increase of blood CCL2 and CXCL1 production expression of inflammatory adhesion molecules such as E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and inflammatory cell migration in tissues. Pravastatin limits the in vivo and in vitro radiation-induced downregulation of eNOS. Moreover, pravastatin has no effect in eNOS(-/-) mice, demonstrating that eNOS plays a key role in the beneficial effect of pravastatin in radiation-induced skin lesions. In conclusion, pravastatin may be a good therapeutic approach to prevent or reduce radiation-induced skin damage.",

    "213": "Statins, such as simvastatin, lower circulating cholesterol levels and are widely prescribed for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Several studies have shown unexpected effects of statins on inflammation. We studied the anti-inflammatory effect of simvastatin using a standard model of an acute local inflammation, the carrageenan-induced footpad oedema. Experimental groups (n = 6-8) were given simvastatin in a dose range 5-30 mg/kg, indomethacin 1-8 mg/kg and methylcellulose (control) per os. Footpad volume was measured with a plethysmograph and compared with the pre-injection volume of the same paw. Swelling (in microlitres) was then calculated, and in drug-treated animals, per cent inhibition was derived through comparison with the control group. Histopathological examination of the skin biopsies was performed to examine severity of paw skin lesions and to confirm the simvastatin-induced inhibition of acute inflammation. Both simvastatin and indomethacin administered orally, 1 hr before carrageenan injection, significantly reduced the extent of footpad oedema. Indomethacin dose-dependently blocked the swelling; the maximal effect was obtained with 8 mg/kg by 48.3% (P < 0.05). Simvastatin produced a comparable anti-inflammatory activity at a dose of 5 mg/kg (32%), while 10 and 30 mg/kg caused a 47.6% and 51.7% reduction, respectively, with the maximal effect observed at 20 mg/kg by 57.2% (P < 0.05). The comparison of the ED(50) of these agents on molar basis showed equipotent anti-inflammatory activity. Histopathological examination of the footpad skin biopsies revealed that simvastatin, dose-dependently and comparablly to indomethacin, reduced polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration. These data support the hypothesis that simvastatin has an acute anti-inflammatory activity.",

This prospective study investigated whether the burden of interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) was of importance for cardiovascular end points and survival. A total of 97 HD patients were studied. The end points included death (reasons given), acute myocardial infarction, or coronary vascular intervention. The extent of ultrafiltration was measured at predefined follow-up points. The IDWG was calculated as ultrafiltration/body weight given in weight%. The burden of IDWG was analyzed. End points occurred in 77 (79%) of the patients during the 5-year study period. The extent of IDWG was higher in those with end points due to cardiovascular reasons (3.77 weight% vs. 3.19 P<0.001), cardiac reasons (P<0.001), congestive heart failure (P<0.01), aortic aneurysm, and intracerebral bleeding (P<0.024).

This was a retrospective case-control pilot study conducted in 101 hemodialysis patients at a large tertiary-care, University health-science center. Sixty cases that experienced frequent VAT and 41 controls that had not experienced VAT in at least 3 years were evaluated for demographics and genotyping. These data were summarized, and univariable and multivariable regression models were constructed. Univariate VAT predictors included the NOS3 420 bp allele (P=0.03) and the presence of a central venous dialysis catheter (P<0.01). Aspirin use was protective against VAT (P=0.02). In the multivariate analysis, the dialysis access type remained a significant predictor of thrombosis (P<0.01), while aspirin use retained its protective status (P=0.01). Statin use was associated with the cases (P=0.02); however, the NOS3 420 bp allele failed to improve the model. These data confirm that central venous dialysis catheter access is associated with thrombosis, while aspirin use appears protective. The NOS3 420 bp allele may have an association with thrombosis; however, further epidemiologic data evaluating large dialysis registries are needed to confirm our observation.",

The National Kidney Foundation guidelines favour the use of statin therapy for treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with CKD. Much evidence supports statin therapy for reducing CVD and improving outcomes in the general population, but there is less evidence in patients with CKD. Consequently, prevention of CVD in CKD is based primarily on extrapolation from non-CKD trials.

Assuming all patients could have their statin titrated up to the maximum dose, the proportion of patients that would reach an LDL-C level of <2.0 mmol/L was projected. To do this, the additional LDL-C reduction patients would achieve with maximal titration of their statin was estimated based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials evaluating LDL-C responses to various statin regimens, and applied to patients' current LDL-C level.",

Because tonic activity of these neurons is directly correlated with the size of their dendritic arbor, we tested the hypothesis that statins decrease dendritic arborization in sympathetic neurons. Oral administration of atorvastatin (20 mg/kg/day for 7 days) significantly reduced dendritic arborization in vivo in sympathetic ganglia of adult male rats. In cultured sympathetic neurons, statins caused dendrite retraction and reversibly blocked bone morphogenetic protein-induced dendritic growth without altering cell survival or axonal growth. Supplementation with mevalonate or isoprenoids, but not cholesterol, attenuated the inhibitory effects of statins on dendritic growth, whereas specific inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis mimicked these statin effects. Statins blocked RhoA translocation to the membrane, an event that requires isoprenylation, and constitutively active RhoA reversed statin effects on dendrites. These observations that statins decrease dendritic arborization in sympathetic neurons by blocking RhoA activation suggest a novel mechanism by which statins decrease sympathetic activity and protect against cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.", 
    "235": "Consumption of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), a viscous dietary fiber, lowers total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, HPMC had not previously been studied in individuals receiving lipid drug therapy.", 
    "236": "This randomized, double-blind crossover trial examined the lipid effects of HPMC in subjects with hypercholesterolemia on statin therapy. Men (n=5) and women (n=8) with LDL-C> or =2.59 mmol/l after at least 4 weeks of stable-dose statin therapy, and a mean age of 58.6 years, were enrolled. Subjects received twice daily doses of either 2.5 g HPMC or control, delivered in a lemonade beverage for 4 weeks, then crossed over to receive the opposite treatment for an additional 4 weeks.", 
    "237": "Mean baseline concentrations of TC, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), LDL-C, HDL-C, triglyceride (TG), TC/HDL-C ratio and apolipoprotein (Apo) B were 4.95, 3.63, 3.03, 1.33, 1.30 and 3.89 mmol/l and 1.00 g/l, respectively. HPMC consumption resulted in significantly larger reductions (P<0.01 vs control for all) in TC (-10.9 vs -3.5%), non-HDL-C (-12.8 vs -2.9%), LDL-C (-15.7 vs -5.1%), TC/HDL-C ratio (-5.3 vs +1.3%) and Apo B (-8.7 vs -3.9%). There were no differences between treatments for changes in HDL-C (-5.2 vs -4.3%) or TG (+3.9 vs +8.9%).", 
    "238": "These results support the view that HPMC is an effective adjunct to statin therapy for further lowering atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins in men and women with primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "239": "To test the hypotheses that decreased insulin-mediated glucose disposal in muscle is associated with a reduced muscle microvascular exchange capacity (Kf) and that 6 months of high-dose statin therapy would improve microvascular function in people with central obesity.", 
    "240": "We assessed skeletal muscle microvascular function, visceral fat mass, physical activity levels, fitness, and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle in 22 female and 17 male volunteers with central obesity whose age (mean +/- SD) was 51 +/- 9 years. We tested the effect of atorvastatin (40 mg daily) on muscle microvascular function in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial lasting 6 months.", 
    "241": "Kf was negatively associated with a measure of glycemia (A1C; r = -0.44, P = 0.006) and positively associated with insulin sensitivity (the ratio of insulin-stimulated glucose effectiveness, or M value, to the mean insulin concentration, or I value; r = 0.39, P = 0.02). In regression modeling, A1C, visceral fat mass, and M:I explained 38% of the variance in Kf (in a linear regression model with Kf as the outcome [R2 = 0.38, P = 0.005]). M:I was associated with Kf independently of visceral fat mass (B coefficient 3.13 [95% CI 0.22-6.02], P = 0.036). Although 6 months' treatment with atorvastatin decreased LDL cholesterol by 51% (P < 0.001) and plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein by 75% (P = 0.02), microvascular function was unchanged.", 
    "242": "Decreased insulin-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle is associated with impaired muscle microvascular exchange capacity (Kf), independently of visceral fat mass. Muscle microvascular function is not improved by 6 months of high-dose statin treatment, despite marked statin-mediated improvements in lipid metabolism and decreased inflammation."
