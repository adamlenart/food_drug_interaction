In the randomised trials the summary odds ratio for death or acute coronary syndrome during the perioperative period with statin use was 0.26 (95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.99) and the summary odds ratio in the cohort studies was 0.70 (0.57 to 0.87). Although the pooled cohort data provided a statistically significant result, statins were not randomly allocated, results in retrospective studies were larger (odds ratio 0.65, 0.50 to 0.84) than those in the prospective cohorts (0.91, 0.65 to 1.27), and dose, duration, and safety of statin use was not reported.",

Because cholesterol synthesis may be inhibited by statins or bisphosphonates, we hypothesized that these drugs might possibly have an influence on cholinesterases. Moreover, we also evaluated if the cholesterol-lowering agents that cross the blood-brain barrier (e.g. simvastatin) should be more effective than those which do not (e.g. atorvastatin). Four groups of rats were orally administered simvastatin, atorvastatin, alendronate or vehicle for seven days. Thereafter, blood samples were taken and the basal ganglia, septum, frontal cortex, and hippocampus were isolated from brains for measurement of acetylcholinesterase activity. In the blood, activities of neither acetyl- nor butyrylcholinesterase were influenced by any of the applied drugs. In the brain, no significant changes in AChE activity were observed after administration of atorvastatin. Both simvastatin and alendronate significantly suppressed the activity of AChE in the frontal cortex. In conclusion, our results confirmed the hypothesis that cholesterol-modifying drugs modulate AChE activity and it is more reasonable to use a blood-brain barrier penetrating drug.", 
    "7": "Recent experimental and epidemiological findings suggest that infectious agents may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. We previously reported that Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) infection reduces the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy for carotid atherosclerosis and that this micro-organism may play a role in the progression of atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the possible association between hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and carotid arteriosclerosis. A total of 165 asymptomatic hypercholesterolemic patients were randomized to receive probucol (500 mg/day, n=82) or pravastatin (10 mg/day, n=83) and were followed for 2 years. The 2-year change of the maximum common carotid artery intima-media thickness (Max-IMT) was the primary endpoint, while the Max-IMT and the incidence of major cardiovascular events were secondary endpoint. All serum samples were tested for antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and all anti-HCV-positive samples were assayed for HCV RNA. Patients without HCV infection (n=25) showed a significant reduction of Max-IMT (-10.9%) (p<0.0001), while a small decrease of Max-IMT was noted in the patients with HCV infection (n=25) (-0. 3%). Significant differences in the reduction of serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were found between patients with and without HCV infection (both p<0.0001). No significant difference in therapeutic effect was noted between the probucol and the pravastatin groups. After adjustment for confounding risk factors, both C. pneumoniae infection and anti-HCV positivity were associated with a greater risk of an increase in Max-IMT (8.5635 [1.3738-15.7532], p<0.05, 9.5040 [0.2886-18.7194], p<0.05, respectively). These findings suggest that both chronic HCV infection and C. pneumoniae infection can reduce the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy for carotid atherosclerosis, and that the HCV may play a role in the progression of atherosclerosis in HCV infected patients.", 
    "8": "Diabetic patients frequently show lipid abnormalities that include qualitative changes in lipid profile. Given the greatly increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia, most principal clinical guidelines recommend aggressively lowering lipid levels in such patients. In fact, several large-scale clinical intervention trials have successfully shown that lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, could significantly reduce the CHD risk in diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia. According to our investigation on 9,000 Japanese diabetic patients, about a half had hyperlipidemia but only less than half of the hyperlipidemic patients received some lipid-lowering agents. Taken together, it should be concluded that more stringent and aggressive intervention should be recommended in the treatment of Japanese diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "9": "Diabetic macroangiopathy is known to increase with complicated hyperlipidemia. Large clinical studies indicate that statins are effective in reducing cardiovascular events in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Target goal for LDL cholesterol in type 2 diabetes is less than 100 mg/dl in the United States, whereas it is less than 120mg/dl in Japan. Aggressive lipid-lowering therapy is indicated for type 2 diabetes, especially those with high risk. Other effects than deceasing LDL of statins, i.e. pleiotropic actions, are suggested to contribute to reduction of cardiovascular events. A decrease in HDL cholesterol and an increase in triglycerides are also risk factors for cardiovascular events, but some portion of them are attributed to dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance.",

    "11": "Rats were given orally with Xuezhikang and simvastatin or vehicle for 2 weeks, and then subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 120 min using intraluminal filament model. L-NAME were injected into the lateral ventricles in half of the rats treated with Xuezhikang and simvastatin 45 min before the ischemia. The neurological deficits examinations were performed at 2, 24, 48 h after reperfusion. After the last examination the animals were sacrificed, the infarct volumes were determined by TTC staining, and MDA levels were also measured.", 
    "12": "Xuezhikang and simvastatin both significantly reduced the infarct volume and improved the functional recovery when compared to vehicle. Xuezhikang and simvastatin both significantly decreased the MDA accumulation after reperfusion. L-NAME partially inhibited the protective effect of Xuezhikang but nearly completely abolished the protective effect of simvastatin.", 
    "13": "Xuezhikang has protective effects on ischemic brain damage in rats, which the beneficial effects are partly due to the statins components. The other components in Xuezhikang may also account for the neuroprotective effects, which is worth further investigations.", 
    "14": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylglutarly coenzyme A, reductase, namely statins, exert pleiotropic actions beyond lipid-lowering effects. In ex vivo and in vitro studies, statins have antioxidative and antiinflammatory effects. Herein, we sought to determine whether treatment with fluvastatin (FV) would be beneficial in a rat model of common bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver injury. Female rats were subjected to a sham (n=10) or BDL (n=20). Obstructive jaundice was induced in rats by the ligation and division of the common bile duct. Three days after operation, rats subjected to CBDL were randomized to receive treatment with either FV (10 mg/kg) or saline every day over a 10 days experimental period. High levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma glutamyltransferase decreased significantly (P<0.05) in animals treated with FV with compared to saline-administrated BDL animals. Compared with sham-operated rats, CBDL rats showed significantly higher levels of total nitrite and nitrate, malondihaldehyde, tumor necrosis factor alpha, myeloperoxidase, and lower concentrations of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in the liver tissue (P<0.001). All of these changes were significantly attenuated (P<0.05) by treatment with FV after CBDL. CBDL was associated with increased apoptosis and nuclear factor kappa beta expression in saline-treated rats. Treatment with FV also decreased these parameters. These data support the view that FV ameliorates hepatic inflammation, lipid peroxidation, and tissue injury in rats subjected to CDBL. FV warrants further evaluation as an adjunctive treatment to ameliorate liver injury from extrahepatic biliary obstruction.", 
    "15": "A low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide detailed information on carotid atherosclerotic plaque size and composition. The purpose of this study was to correlate HDL levels with carotid plaque burden and composition by MRI. Thirty-four patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) receiving simvastatin plus niacin or placebo for both drugs for three years were randomly selected to undergo MRI of carotid arteries. Atherosclerotic plaque wall volumes (WVs) and plaque components including lipid rich/necrotic core (LR/NC), calcium, fibrous tissue, and loose matrix were measured. Mean WV or atherosclerotic burden was significantly associated with total HDL-C levels (r = -0.39, P = 0.02), HDL(2) (r = -0.36, P = 0.03), HDL(3) (r = -0.34, P = 0.04), and LDL/HDL ratio (r = 0.42, P = 0.02). Plaque lipid composition or LR/NC was significantly associated with HDL(3) (r = -0.68, P = 0.02). Patients with low HDL levels (<or=35 mg/dL) had increased WV (97 +/- 23 vs. 81 +/- 19 mm(3), P = 0.05) compared with patients with HDL levels > 35 mg/dL. Among CAD patients, low HDL-C levels were significantly associated with increased carotid atherosclerotic plaque burden and lipid content by MRI.", 
    "16": "Oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the effects of antioxidants including probucol, vitamin E, and fluvastatin, an HMG-CoA (hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitor with antioxidative property, on plasma levels of oxidized LDL (OxLDL) during the progression of atherosclerosis in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. OxLDL were measured as ligand for lectin-like OxLDL receptor-1 (LOX-1). LOX-1-ligand was higher in WHHL rabbits than in control rabbits as early as 2 months of age and was sustained throughout the experimental period. Supplementation of probucol (1%) and vitamin E (0.5%) to the diet reduced LOX-1-ligand but had little effect on total cholesterol (T-CHO). Fluvastatin (0.03%) significantly reduced both LOX-1-ligand and T-CHO. The extent of reduction in T-CHO was less prominent than in the case of LOX-1-ligand. All of the agents reduced the atherosclerotic lesion area and lipid contents of aortic arches. These parallel results indicate that oxidatively modified LDL elevated in the early stages of atherogenesis is of functional importance in the progression of the disease and can be suppressed by antioxidant treatment. Furthermore, fluvastatin may reduce the evolution of atherosclerosis, not only by lowering plasma cholesterol but also by reducing oxidative modification of LDL.", 
    "17": "We examined effects of a physiologic concentration of pitavastatin (0.01 micromol/L) on oxidant-induced apoptosis in cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Apoptosis was induced in VSMCs by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 300 micromol/L), as evidenced by in situ nick end-labeling and scanning electron microscopy. This apoptotic response was accompanied by increased activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs--ie, increases in the phosphorylated forms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), and p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK). Although pitavastatin alone did not induce VSMC death, pretreatment with pitavastatin significantly enhanced H2O2-induced apoptosis and prolonged activation of JNK and p38 MAPK (for up to 24 h) but not ERK. Expression of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) also was upregulated by H2O2, but this was not affected by pitavastatin. The apoptosis accelerating effect was observed also in simvastatin but not in pravastatin. Treating VSMCs with mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate completely blocked the statin-induced enhancement of VSMC apoptosis, suggesting that protein prenylation is critically involved. It thus appears that pitavastatin enhances H2O2-induced VSMC apoptosis, at least in part, via increases in MAPK activation and protein prenylation, but independently of MKP-1 expression, which consequently results in reduction of VSMC population.", 
    "18": "Neutrophil superoxide anion generation was measured during atorvastatin and fluvastatin therapy in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. The patients were randomly allotted into three groups. The atorvastatin group comprised 17 patients who were administered the drug orally 10 mg a day at bed time. The fluvastatin group consisted of 18 patients on an oral dose of 40 mg once daily at bed time. The control group comprised 12 healthy subjects with no drug administration. Blood samples were collected from cubital vein before and after 6-week therapy with these drugs and once in the control group. Neutrophil superoxide anion generation in whole blood without and with opsonized zymosan (OZ) stimulation was determined using superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes. In the atorvastatin group, statistically significant (P < 0.05) decrease in superoxide anion generation by nonstimulated and OZ-stimulated neutrophils was observed after 6 weeks of therapy. In fluvastatin group, no changes in neutrophil superoxide anion generation were observed after the 6-week treatment period. Our study has shown an additional nonlipid mechanism of atorvastatin used in CHD primary prevention.",

Few data exist on lipid management in rural settings. To determine the proportion of rural dyslipidemic patients achieving ATP III goals, records of 461 patients were reviewed from 4 practices. Only 54% of the patients with dyslipidemia achieved ATP III goals. Patients with diabetes or with a family history of premature coronary heart disease were less likely to achieve ATP III goals (odds ratio 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.84 and odds ratio 0.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.71, respectively). Patients taking statins were more likely to achieve goals (odds ratio 3.23; 95% confidence interval, 2.13-4.89). These results indicate that a significant proportion of patients with dyslipidemia in rural practices do not achieve management goals. Strategies to improve lipid management in rural practices are needed.", 
    "27": "The effect of Atorvastatin on transcriptional activity in murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by PLP peptide 139-151 was analyzed by DNA microarray technique in lymph nodes and spinal cord at onset (10 days), height (20 days) and first remission (30 days) of disease. Fourteen genes were selectively influenced by Atorvastatin in EAE mice. They are mainly related to immune cell functions and regulation of cell-to-cell interaction. Interestingly, seven genes were also differentially regulated in CFA-injected control mice. But qualitative and quantitative differences to EAE mice argue for a dependency of statin effects on the activation status of target cells. Differential regulation of the newly detected candidate genes of statin effects COX-1 and HSP-105 and the previously known statin-responsive genes ICAM-1 and CD86 was confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Flow cytometric analysis of lymph node cells revealed that the effect of Atorvastatin treatment in non-immunized healthy animals resembled the effect of immunization with PLP peptide regarding changes of T helper cells, activated B cells and macrophages. In EAE mice, these effects were partially reversed by Atorvastatin treatment. Monitoring of expression of the newly identified candidate genes and patterns of lymphocyte subpopulations might predict the responsiveness of multiple sclerosis patients to statin treatment.", 
    "28": "Statins have revolutionized the treatment of hypercholesterolemia due to their ability to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. Their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects and positive effects on the treatment of atherosclerosis and its complications are well known. Here, we describe the effects of statins on the treatment of presbycusis in C57BL/6J mice. In this strain with accelerated aging, we demonstrate that animals treated with atorvastatin (10mg/kg per day in chow diet) for 2 months showed larger amplitudes of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) than did the non-treated control group. This finding indicates a better survival of outer hair cell function in the inner ear of C57BL/6J mice. The observed decreased expression of intercellular and vascular adhesion molecules in the aortic wall of atorvastatin-treated animals suggests that reducing endothelial inflammatory effects may contribute to the positive effect of atorvastatin on the amplitudes of DPOAE by influencing the blood supply to the inner ear. No such beneficial effect of statins was found in apoE(-/-) mice treated with atorvastatin under the same conditions. Our results suggest that statins could also slow down the age-related deterioration of hearing in man.",

Inhibitors of 3-hyroxy-3-methylgluteryl CoA reductase (statins) can modify the composition of lipid rafts, resulting in alteration of T cell signaling. In this study, we show that atorvastatin targets the distribution of signaling molecules in T cells from SLE patients, by disrupting the colocalization of total Lck and CD45 within lipid rafts, leading to a reduction in the active form of Lck. Upon T cell activation using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 in vitro, the rapid recruitment of total Lck to the immunological synapse was inhibited by atorvastatin, whereas ERK phosphorylation, which is decreased in SLE T cells, was reconstituted. Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the production of IL-10 and IL-6 by T cells, implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE. Thus, atorvastatin reversed many of the signaling defects characteristic of SLE T cells. These findings demonstrate the potential for atorvastatin to target lipid raft-associated signaling abnormalities in autoreactive T cells and provide a rationale for its use in therapy of autoimmune disease.",

    "55": "In cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells, treatment with atorvastatin significantly increased nNOS expression, associated with activation of Akt and NF-kappaB. Inhibition of Akt by dominant-negative Akt suppressed atorvastatin-induced nNOS expression as well as Akt and NF-kappaB activation. Inhibition of NF-kappaB by dominant-negative IkappaB also attenuated atorvastatin-induced nNOS expression and NF-kappaB activation, but not Akt activation. We further examined whether atorvastatin also enhances nNOS expression in isolated mouse aorta, and if so, how much nNOS-derived NO accounts for atorvastatin-induced NOx production. In isolated aortas of wild-type mice, atorvastatin significantly increased all three NOS isoform expression and NOx production. In isolated aortas of doubly i/eNOS(-/-), n/eNOS(-/-), and n/iNOS(-/-) mice, which express only nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS, respectively, atorvastatin-induced NOx production was approximately 25%, 25%, and 50% to that of wild-type mice, respectively, suggesting that nNOS accounts for 25% of the atorvastatin-mediated NOx production.",

For validation of the method, the recovery of the free analytes was compared with that from an optimized extraction method, and the analyte stability was examined under conditions mimicking the sample storage, handling, and analysis procedures. The extraction procedure yielded extremely clean extracts with a recovery of 107.44 and 98.93% for pravastatin and IS, respectively. The intra-assay and inter-assay precisions for the samples at the LLOQ were 3.30 and 7.31% respectively. The calibration curves were linear for the dynamic range 0.5-200 ng/mL with correlation coefficient r > or = 0.9988. The intra- and inter-assay accuracy ranged from 95.87 to 112.40%.

    "58": "Factors that regulate apolipoprotein E (apoE) secretion by macrophages will have important effects on vessel wall lipid flux and atherosclerosis. Macrophages express the LDL receptor, which binds apoE with high affinity and could thereby affect the net secretion of apoE from macrophages. In these studies, we demonstrate that treatment of J774 macrophages transfected to constitutively express a human apoE3 cDNA with simvastatin, to increase LDL receptor activity, reduces the secretion of apoE. To further examine the relationship between LDL receptor expression and apoE secretion from macrophages, mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) were isolated from mice with constitutively high expression of human LDL receptor to increase overall LDL receptor expression by 2- to 3-fold. Cells with increased LDL receptor expression also showed reduced apoE secretion compared with MPMs with basal LDL receptor expression. The effect of changes in LDL receptor expression on apoE secretion was isoform-specific, with greater reduction of apoE4 compared with apoE3 secretion and no reduction of apoE2 secretion, paralleling the known affinity of each isoform for LDL receptor binding. The effect of the LDL receptor on apoE secretion for each isoform was further reflected in LDL receptor-dependent changes in apoE-mediated cholesterol efflux. These results establish a regulatory interaction between two branches of macrophage sterol homeostatic pathways that could facilitate a rapid response to changes in macrophage sterol content relative to need.",

These trials also suggest, and laboratory investigations establish, that statins possess favourable vascular effects independent of cholesterol reduction. Statins appear to interfere specifically with the pathophysiologic mechanisms implicated in atherothrombotic disease. Statins reduce vascular inflammation, improve endothelial function, stabilize VAPs, and reduce platelet aggregability and thrombus formation.

We assessed the effects of simvastatin on cultures of rat newborn and human fetal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and human adult mature oligodendrocytes (OLGs) with respect to cellular events pertaining to myelin maintenance and repair. Short-term simvastatin treatment of OPCs (1 day) induced robust process extension, enhanced differentiation to a mature phenotype, and decreased spontaneous migration. These effects were reversed by isoprenoid products and mimicked with an inhibitor of Rho kinase (ROCK), the downstream effector of the isoprenylated protein RhoA GTPase. Prolonged treatment (2 days) caused process retraction that was rescued by cholesterol, and increased cell death (4 days) partially rescued by either cholesterol or isoprenoid co-treatment. In comparison, simvastatin treatment of human mature OLGs required a longer initial time course (2 days) to induce significant process outgrowth, mimicked by inhibiting ROCK. Prolonged treatment of mature OLGs was associated with process retraction (6 days) and increased cell death (8 days). Human-derived OPCs and mature OLGs demonstrated an increased sensitivity to simvastatin relative to the rodent cells, responding to nanomolar versus micromolar concentrations.

    "79": "Recruitment of human CD34+ progenitor cells toward vascular lesions and differentiation into vascular cells has been regarded as a critical initial step in atherosclerosis. Previously we found that adherent platelets represent potential mediators of progenitor cell homing besides their role in thrombus formation. On the other hand, foam cell formation represents a key process in atherosclerotic plaque formation. To investigate whether platelets are involved in progenitor cell recruitment and differentiation into endothelial cells and foam cells, we examined the interactions of platelets and CD34+ progenitor cells. Cocultivation experiments showed that human platelets recruit CD34+ progenitor cells via the specific adhesion receptors P-selectin/PSGL-1 and beta1- and beta2-integrins. Furthermore, platelets were found to induce differentiation of CD34+ progenitor cells into mature foam cells and endothelial cells. Platelet-induced foam cell generation could be prevented partially by HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors via reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) secretion. Finally, agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and -gamma attenuated platelet-induced foam cell generation and production of MMP-9. The present study describes a potentially important mechanism of platelet-induced foam cell formation and generation of endothelium in atherogenesis and atheroprogression. The understanding and modulation of these mechanisms may offer new treatment strategies for patients at high risk for atherosclerotic diseases.",

Statins in particular have been shown to influence the biology of endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and constituents of the interstitial matrix, particularly fibroblasts. It is no wonder that concurrent therapy of dyslipidemia with statins enhances the effects of RAS inhibitors.

Advancing age is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which represents a major global healthcare problem. The clinical efficacy and safety of lipid lowering treatment (especially statins) is well established following a series of large-scale, randomised controlled trials, which mainly recruited patients under the age of 70 years. Subgroup analyses together with the findings of trials involving sufficient numbers of elderly participants, such as the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) and the Heart Protection Study (HPS) offer a basis for considering statin therapy in this population. Furthermore, since this population is at greater absolute risk of CVD, substantial benefits from adequate treatment may be anticipated. However, underevaluation and undertreatment appear to be common in the elderly. In this review, we provide a survey of potentially modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in association with old age, and discuss the relevant findings of large-scale end-point clinical studies as well as major considerations regarding lipid-lowering treatment in this population. It is concluded that the decision whether to treat hypercholesterolaemia in the elderly is currently individualised, depending upon the degree of risk, general health, willingness to receive treatment and financial concerns. Further, prospective randomised trials are required to guide physicians towards an effective management of older individuals at increased atherosclerotic risk.",

The latter possibility is supported by functional studies with promoters, higher levels of diversity in the promoters of class II than class I genes and the relatively high frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms around transcription factor binding sites.

We searched for articles from 1982 through June 2006 in MEDLINE and other databases. The main inclusion criteria were double blind, placebo controlled RCTs with a monotherapy intervention of any marketed statin and active surveillance of adverse events. We excluded studies of drug interactions, organ transplants, or exercise, or those not meeting all of the study quality criteria. The primary analysis was a statin formulation stratified fixed-effect model using Peto odds-ratios (POR). Secondary analyses explored the stability of the primary results.",

    "116": "We aimed to study the relationship between the prescribing of lipid-lowering medication, social deprivation and other general practice characteristics. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of all general practices in England, 2004-05. For each practice, the following variables were obtained: standardized cost and volume data for lipid-lowering medication, descriptors of general practices, Index of Multiple Deprivation, 2004, ethnicity data from the 2001 Census and Quality and Outcomes Framework data. A regression model was constructed which explained 34.5% of the variation in statin prescribing by general practitioners. The most powerful predictors were higher social deprivation, higher prevalence of coronary heart disease and achievement of cholesterol targets for diabetics. Negative regression coefficients were demonstrated for the proportion of elderly patients in the practice and, to a lesser extent, for the proportion of south Asian and Afro-Caribbean patients. In conclusion, contrary to previous local studies, we found that statin prescribing was higher in more deprived communities, even after adjustment for increased disease prevalence and practice variables associated with deprivation. Statin prescribing was also independently associated with success at achieving cholesterol targets in established disease (secondary prevention). However, our findings suggest under-prescribing of statins to the elderly and possibly also to ethnic minorities.", 
    "117": "Atherothrombosis results from direct interaction between the atherosclerotic plaque and arterial thrombosis, and underlies most forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The pathophysiology of atherosclerosis is now recognised to involve endothelial dysfunction and dyslipidemia with cholesterol accumulation, as well as critical immuno-inflammatory and apoptotic dimensions. Erosion or rupture of a vulnerable, lipid-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic plaque triggers the formation of a platelet-rich thrombus that may partially or completely occlude the artery, with resultant clinical scenarios including stable and unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke. Insight into the pathophysiology of atherothrombosis indicates that an integrated risk factor approach, focusing particularly on management of dyslipidaemia (with a statin) and thrombosis (with aspirin), may constitute an optimal therapeutic approach. Both agents have established roles in secondary prevention. Statin action on atherogenic lipoproteins mediates plaque stabilisation, modification of plaque morphology and attenuation of inflammation, and may lead to plaque regression, while aspirin reduces platelet activation and aggregation, decreases release of inflammatory cytokines at sites of vascular injury and attenuates vasoconstriction. Given these complementary modes of action, this combination would be a logical choice for reducing atherothrombotic risk in patients with CVD. Meta-analysis of 5 major clinical studies has demonstrated that the combination of pravastatin plus aspirin was significantly more effective than either agent alone in reducing the relative risk of key cardiovascular endpoints including MI and ischaemic stroke. This combination may therefore represent an important, cost-efficient therapeutic approach to reduction of cardiovascular risk and prevention of recurrent events in stable CVD.", 
    "118": "Recent reports have implicated osteoprotegerin (OPG) in cardiovascular disease processes. Endothelial and smooth muscle cells produce OPG and its expression in these cells is upregulated by inflammatory mediators. Statins, which besides their lipid lowering properties have various vasculoprotective effects, have been shown to regulate OPG expression in osteoblasts. We investigated whether statins affect the expression of OPG in human endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Using an ELISA we could demonstrate that statins reduce tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced OPG production in cultured human endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Atorvastatin also downregulated interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha)-induced OPG production in endothelial cells. A significant reduction of TNF-alpha-induced OPG was seen when statins were used in the nanomolar range. These results were confirmed at the level of specific mRNA expression by real-time-PCR. Using LDH leakage as a marker of cell damage we show that cell viability was not affected by statins at concentrations used in our study. The effect of statins on TNF-alpha-induced OPG production was reversed by mevalonate and geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate at the level of protein production and at the level of mRNA expression, suggesting that it was brought about by inhibition of the mevalonic acid pathway and protein prenylation. Through our results we have added OPG to the list of molecules whose TNF-alpha-induced upregulation is counteracted by statins. If such an effect is also operative in the in vivo setting, one could postulate a role for statins in the modulation of cardiovascular disease processes possibly regulated by OPG.",

Lipid abnormalities, especially hypercholesterolaemia, are important in the initiation of the valvular lesions and also in the calcification of the aortic orifice. Experimental data and retrospective clinical studies suggest, but without proof, that statins could slow th progression of the aortic stenosis.

It is possible that this pathway is a target for pleiotropic drugs such as atorvastatin. We studied therefore the effect of atorvastatin on extracellular nucleotide degradation in human endothelial cells. Atorvastatin treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) resulted in significant increase in ATP breakdown and adenosine formation both if analysed in intact cell studies and as enzyme activity in cell lysates. We conclude that one of the beneficial effects of atorvastatin may include acceleration of extracellular nucleotide breakdown.

    "135": "The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a collection of hematopoietic disorders with varying degrees of mono- to trilineage cytopenias and bone marrow dysplasia. In recent years much progress has been made in the treatment of MDS and there are now several therapeutic compounds used with varying levels of success. These compounds typically cause side effects that make them unattractive for treatment of patients in the early stages of MDS. Naturally occurring compounds that are not toxic may provide a means to treat patients in the initial stages of disease. We conducted a pilot study to test the efficacy of coenzyme Q10 (coQ10) in MDS patients with low to intermediate-2 risk disease. A variety of responses were observed in 7 of 29 patients including two trilineage and two cytogenetic responses. Sequencing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from pretreatment bone marrows showed multiple mutations, some resulting in amino acid changes, in 3/5 nonresponders, 1/4 responders and in two control samples. We conclude that coQ10 may be of clinical benefit in a subset of MDS patients, but responders cannot be easily pre-selected on the basis of either the conventional clinical and pathologic characteristics or mtDNA mutations.", 
    "136": "The newest guidelines for treating people with coronary artery disease (CAD) suggest benefit from statin-induced LDL cholesterol lowering regardless of baseline LDL cholesterol level. These guidelines were based on recent clinical trials that showed statistically significant statin-induced relative risk reductions (RRR) in cardiovascular events. However, there are proven \"non-statin\" anti-atherosclerotic treatments. This analysis was designed to allow the physician to decide which patients benefit from the various anti-atherosclerotic treatments available. Analysis is presented as absolute risk reduction (ARR) because ARR takes baseline risk into account. There was a large benefit from statin therapy in stable CAD when LDL cholesterol levels were high. There were diminishing returns, despite statistically significance, with statin treatment of people with chronic CAD and lower LDL cholesterol levels. People with chronic CAD and lower LDL cholesterol levels had at least as much and possibly twice the ARR when treated with niacin or gemfibrozil as that would occur with statin treatment. For the first year after the acute coronary syndrome, risk was higher than in stable CAD, and trials showed a benefit especially with a Mediterranean diet and also with statin therapy that reduced LDL cholesterol levels to approximately 80 mg dl(-1). The Mediterranean diet was also beneficial in chronic CAD. These results suggest that both statin and non-statin therapy are important for reducing the sequelae of atherosclerosis.", 
    "137": "Lipids, including cholesterol, are critical components of the cell membrane where they are enriched in microdomains, lipid rafts, which organize and concentrate receptors and intracellular proteins involved in signal transduction. The present study examined the effects of cholesterol depletion on serotonin (5-HT) binding and signaling via 5-hydroxytryptamine(7) (5-HT(7)) receptors in stably transfected HeLa cells. Immunohistochemical, ligand-binding and biotinylation experiments demonstrated that the studied cells expressed high levels of 5-HT(7) receptors at their surface with a pharmacological profile resembling 5-HT(7) receptors in native tissue. Depletion of cholesterol, by combined treatment with mevastatin, fumonisin B(1) and mevalonate or methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD), caused highly significant reductions in the B(max) values of [(3)H]5-HT- and [(3)H]-(R)-3-(2-(2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)-ethyl)pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl)phenol ([(3)H]SB269970)-binding to 5-HT(7) receptors. Cholesterol depletion also reduced the total level of 5-HT(7) receptor protein determined by Western blot analysis. None of the examined treatments affected the affinity of [(3)H]5-HT- or [(3)H]SB269970-binding to 5-HT(7) receptors. Treatment with serotonin caused strong inductions in the phosphorylation states of Ser(63)-ATF-1 and Ser(133)-CREB. These effects of serotonin on signal transduction were significantly counteracted by pre-treatment with cholesterol synthesis inhibitors. Altogether, the present study demonstrates that cholesterol depletion decreases binding of both agonist and antagonist radioligands to 5-HT(7) receptors and counteract 5-HT(7) receptor-mediated intracellular signaling.",

Most of the evidence supports the role of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes in many of these drug interactions. However, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux protein located in the gastrointestinal tract, placenta, kidneys, brain, and liver, may also play a role. Results of several studies with in vitro models have shown that lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin are inhibitors for P-gp and may be substrates for this transporter as well. Pravastatin and fluvastatin consistently demonstrate no significant inhibition of P-gp. Drug interaction studies involving statins and digoxin support a role for P-gp. Many additional drugs such as diltiazem, verapamil, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and cyclosporine, as well as dietary supplements such as St. John's wort and grapefruit juice, interact with statins and are modulators of both CYP3A4 and P-gp.

A minority of around 400 families worldwide can be grouped as hereditary in origin, whereas the majority of all Alzheimer cases (approx. 25 million worldwide) are sporadic in origin. In the pathophysiology of the latter type, a number of susceptibility genes contribute to the disease among which are allelic abnormalities of the apolipoprotein E4 gene pointing to a link between disturbed cholesterol metabolism and sporadic AD. Cholesterol is a main component of membrane composition enriched in microdomains and is functionally linked to the proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). In sporadic AD, a marked diminution of both membrane phospholipids and cholesterol has been found. Evidence has been provided that high plasma cholesterol may protect from AD. In contrast to these well documented abnormalities observed in AD patients, it was assumed that an elevated cholesterol concentration might favour the generation of beta-amyloid and, thus, AD. However, a series of in vitro-and in vivo-studies did not provide evidence for the assumption that an enhanced cholesterol concentration increased betaA4-production. A harsh reduction of membrane cholesterol only caused a \"beneficial\" effect of APP metabolism. However, this experimentally induced condition may not be compatible to sporadic AD. The application of statins in sporadic AD did not yield results to assume that this therapeutic strategy may prevent or treat successfully sporadic AD.",

After adjustment for differences in age distribution between the study sample and the overall population of Ravenna, the estimated excess drug costs associated with overweight and obesity in Ravenna were Euro 5,661,126.20 and Euro 6,688,099.85, respectively.", 
    "164": "In this study sample, the prevalence of overweight increased by approximately 10% and the prevalence of obesity increased by approximately 5% with each decade of age up to 60 years, after which it remained stable at approximately 40% and approximately 20%, respectively. Overweight and obesity were associated with increased drug exposure and costs in all age groups considered.",

    "167": "An economic simulation model was developed that used a Markov process to project the number of cardiovascular events and associated costs in a high-risk population in various treatment scenarios. According to the ATP III, high-risk patients are those with CHD, atherosclerosis of peripheral and/or cerebral arteries, diabetes, and/or multiple other risk factors conferring a risk of at least 20% within 10 years. Data on population characteristics and costs of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were obtained from claims data sets from employer-funded commercial and Medicare health plans in the United States. Treatment of lipid disorders was translated into CVD risk reduction based on results from the Heart Protection Study. The estimated efficacies of individual lipid-lowering drugs were based on data published in package inserts. The model generated costs at the health plan level of lipid-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and the number and total costs of cardiovascular events. Estimates were compared for scenarios representing the mix of treatments used before and after the introduction of rosuvastatin. Estimates were generated separately for commercial and Medicare health plans.", 
    "168": "For every 1 million members of a commercial health plan, an estimated 44,457 met ATP III criteria for high-risk status. Use of rosuvastatin in place of other 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") by 11 % of these patients over a period of 5 years was estimated to result in 36 fewer cardiovascular events and a net savings of US 4.03 million dollars. A Medicare plan of 1 million members with an estimated 433,268 high-risk patients and 7% rosuvastatin use was estimated to avoid 727 events and save US 34.32 million dollars.", 
    "169": "The results of this data analysis suggest that increasing the use of rosuvastatin can result in cardiovascular event reduction and cost savings. Because the impact of lipid-modifying therapy on cardiovascular risk has not been thoroughly documented in controlled clinical studies, our model assumed that incremental lipid changes had effects in proportion to the magnitude of change.",

However, the terminology and methodology used for measuring persistence varied across studies, making it difficult to compare persistence rates.",

    "173": "Thirty-one articles were identified and reviewed. Few of the studies explicitly stated the conceptual definition of persistence used. Five methods of measuring persistence were identified: anniversary models, minimum-refills models, refill-sequence models, proportion-of-days-covered models, and hybrid models. When these models were applied to data for the hypothetical patient, total persistence with drug therapy ranged from 7 days to >1 year.", 
    "174": "There continue to be inconsistencies in the definition of persistence and the methods by which it is measured.

Interacting medicines featured in 77% of reports of rhabdomyolysis associated with simvastatin and 44% of reports associated with atorvastatin. A comparison of the age profile for reports of atorvastatin- and simvastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis with that for all adverse drug reaction reports received, and for all reports of muscle disorders, suggested a trend towards an increasing risk of rhabdomyolysis with increasing age with simvastatin but not with atorvastatin. Similarly, comparing prescribed tablet strengths from Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ('statin') doses in reports of rhabdomyolysis suggested a dose-related risk with simvastatin, but a less increased risk with high-dose atorvastatin.", 
    "178": "Risk factors for rhabdomyolysis featured in nearly all of the reports of statin-associated rhabdomyolysis and the majority of reports listed multiple risk factors, although dependence on risk factors appeared to be stronger with simvastatin than atorvastatin.

    "186": "The most important risk factor for stroke is blood pressure: lowering the diastolic pressure by 5-6 mmHg or the systolic pressure by 10 mmHg will reduce the number of strokes in the general population (primary prevention) by 30-40% over 4-5 years. This effect is enhanced by the concurrent use of diuretics. The association between stroke and serum cholesterol was unclear until trials on preventing cardiovascular disease showed the introduction of statins to be clearly beneficial on strokes. In the recent 'Stroke prevention by aggressive reduction in cholesterol levels' (SPARCL) trial, high-dose statin therapy was shown to reduce the risk of fatal and non-fatal stroke in patients with a history of ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), but without manifest coronary disease (secondary prevention). A difference in LDL-cholesterol of 1.4 mmol/l was associated with a significant absolute 5-year risk reduction of fatal and non-fatal stroke of 2.2%, whereas the risk of major cardiovascular events was reduced by 3.5%. It is already known that stroke or TIA should be regarded as a 'coronary heart disease risk equivalent' for which secondary prevention guidelines apply. However, high-dose statin therapy should be given only after careful selection of the stroke patient at very high risk because of its high cost, adverse effects and a possible increase in haemorrhagic stroke.", 
    "187": "This analysis of the Ezetimibe Add-on to Statin for Effectiveness (EASE) trial examined the effectiveness and safety of ezetimibe 10 mg added to ongoing statin therapy in patients with diabetes, metabolic syndrome without diabetes, or neither disorder who had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels exceeding National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATP III) goals. After six weeks of treatment, ezetimibe added to statin reduced LDL-C in patients with diabetes by 28%, metabolic syndrome by 24%, or neither by 26%, compared with a 3% reduction for placebo for each group. In each group, more patients receiving ezetimibe plus statin reached LDL-C goal (67-74%) compared with those receiving placebo plus statin (19-22%). Other parameters demonstrating greater improvement with ezetimibe included triglycerides, apolipoprotein (Apo)B/Apo A-I ratio, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein. Ezetimibe plus statin was well tolerated in each group. Ezetimibe added to ongoing statin therapy offers a new treatment option that is consistently effective in improvement of lipid profiles and attainment of LDL-C goals in patients with without diabetes or metabolic syndrome.", 
    "188": "Interindividual variation exists in response to statin therapy. It has been hypothesized that subjects with higher baseline cholesterol synthesis rates are more sensitive to statins. To directly test this hypothesis, mice overexpressing the heterodimeric ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter G5/G8 (G5G8(Tg) mice) were treated with lovastatin because they have a compensatory increase in cholesterol biosynthesis as a result of increased cholesterol excretion into bile and feces. As expected, lovastatin treatment did not alter plasma and hepatic cholesterol levels in wild-type mice. Interestingly, this treatment significantly reduced plasma concentration and hepatic content of cholesterol by 42% and 17.3%, respectively, in the statin-treated versus untreated G5G8(Tg) mice despite a greater feedback upregulation of genes in the pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis in the lovastatin-treated G5G8(Tg) mice. The reduced plasma cholesterol concentration is unlikely to be attributed to LDL and HDL receptors because the protein levels of both receptors remained unchanged. Surprisingly, statin treatment resulted in an increase in biliary cholesterol concentration, which was associated with an upregulation in hepatic mRNA and protein levels of ABCG5 and ABCG8, and in hepatic mRNA levels of Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), a gene that is required for intestinal cholesterol absorption. In conclusion, mice with higher endogenous cholesterol synthesis rates are more sensitive to statin. A synergistic hypocholesterolemic effect could be potentially achieved in humans by simultaneously inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and promoting ABCG5/ABCG8-mediated cholesterol excretion.", 
    "189": "The number of patients taking HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors for hypercholesterolaemia is growing rapidly. Treatment with HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but may rarely cause serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The most serious ADRs of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors are musculoskeletal symptoms including myopathy and myositis, (life-threatening) rhabdomyolysis and liver failure. Furthermore, peripheral neuropathy might also occur, especially after long-term use of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors. Because of the severity and the relative rarity of HMG-CoA-reductase-induced neuropathy, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb has analysed its database of reported ADRs for reports concerning neuropathy associated with the use of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors. Until June 2005, Lareb received 17 reports of neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and polyneuropathy and in addition two reports of aggravation of existing polyneuropathy associated with the use of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors. The associations neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy and polyneuropathy and the use of hMg-CoA-reductase inhibitors are statistically significantly more often reported to Lareb. The average time to onset supports conclusions of previous studies and case reports that especially long-term exposure increases the risk for peripheral neuropathy. Considering the increasing number of patients taking HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors, health care professionals should be aware of the possible role of these drugs in neuropathy.", 
    "190": "Although the effect of apolipoprotein E gene polymorphism on the response to treatment with statins has been studied, the results are conflicting. Moreover, little is known about the possible effect of apolipoprotein E alleles on the response to treatment with fibrates. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of apolipoprotein E polymorphism on lipid-lowering response to treatment with atorvastatin and fenofibrate in patients with different types of dyslipidemia. The study population included 136 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (type IIA dyslipidemia) treated with atorvastatin (20 mg/day) and 136 patients with either primary hypertriglyceridemia (type IV dyslipidemia) or mixed hyperlipidemia (type IIB dyslipidemia) treated with micronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day). Overall, no significant associations were detected between apolipoprotein E genotype and response to treatment with atorvastatin. In patients treated with fenofibrate, significant associations were noted between apolipoprotein E genotype and changes in apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein E and triglyceride levels. Specifically, in apolipoprotein E2, apolipoprotein E3, and apolipoprotein E4 individuals, apolipoprotein B reductions were 22%, 17%, and 8%, respectively (P = .003); apolipoprotein E reductions were 45%, 20%, and 15%, respectively (P = .006); whereas triglyceride reductions reached 53%, 36%, and 33%, respectively (P = .033). In conclusion, apolipoprotein E genotype had no significant effect on the response to treatment with atorvastatin in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, but in patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia or mixed hyperlipidemia, there was a clear association between apolipoprotein E genotype and response to treatment with fenofibrate.", 
    "191": "This study examined lipid levels and the use of lipid-altering drugs in a contemporary general medical population without documented coronary heart disease (CHD) but with CHD risk equivalents. On the basis of present national guidelines, the following lipid values (in milligrams per deciliter) were considered optimal for this population: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <100, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol >or=40 in men and >or=50 in women, and non-HDL cholesterol <130 if triglycerides are >or=200. Of 44,052 active patients screened, 877 with CHD risk equivalents as defined by the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines were identified. Most patients did not meet optimal lipid targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (59%), HDL cholesterol (66%), and non-HDL cholesterol (72%). Indeed, 88% of patients did not meet >or=1 lipid goal. Statins were used in 57% of patients. In patients with low HDL cholesterol, only 4.7% were taking niacin and 4.9% fibrates. In the subgroup of patients with triglycerides >or=200 mg/dl, only 9.5% were taking fibrates and 8.2% niacin. In conclusion, the present analysis highlights the dramatic need to further improve preventive measures in a substantial proportion of high-risk patients with CHD risk equivalents.", 
    "192": "We investigated in 449 patients with severe carotid arterial disease, who did not undergo revascularization, the incidence of new stroke or new myocardial infarction (MI) or death in patients treated with statins (66%) and in patients not treated with lipid-lowering therapy (34%). Hypercholesterolemia was present in all of the 298 patients (100%) treated with statins and in 145 of 151 patients (96%) not treated with statins (p = 0.001). Follow-up was 26 +/- 18 months in patients treated with statins and 21 +/- 17 months in patients not treated with statins (p <0.0001). New stroke or new MI or death occurred in 45 of 298 patients (15%) treated with statins and in 102 of 151 patients (68%) not treated with statins (p <0.0001). Stepwise Cox regression analysis showed that significant independent prognostic factors for time to development of new stroke or new MI or death were use of statins (risk ratio 0.13, p <0.0001), smoking (risk ratio 1.45, p = 0.0329), systemic hypertension (risk ratio 1.81, p = 0.0011), diabetes mellitus (risk ratio 2.87, p <0.0001), previous stroke (risk ratio 3.18, p <0.0001), and previous MI (risk ratio 2.15, p <0.0001). In conclusion, statins decrease the incidence of new stroke or MI or death in patients with severe carotid arterial disease who do not undergo revascularization.", 
    "193": "Left ventricular (LV) remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been well described in previous studies. However, there is a paucity of data on the incidence of and risk factors for LV remodeling in modern clinical practice that incorporates widespread use of acute reperfusion strategies and almost systematic use of \"antiremodeling\" medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers. We enrolled 266 patients with anterior wall Q-wave AMI who had >or=3 segments of the infarct zone that were akinetic on echocardiography before discharge. Echocardiographic follow-up was performed 3 months and 1 year after AMI. LV volumes, ejection fraction, wall motion score index, and mitral flow velocities were determined in a blinded analysis at a core echocardiographic laboratory. Acute reperfusion was attempted in 220 patients (83%; primary angioplasty in 29% and thrombolysis in 54%). During hospitalization, 99% of patients underwent coronary angiography and 87% underwent coronary stenting of the infarct-related lesion. At 1 year, 95% of patients received an antiplatelet agent, 89% a beta blocker, 93% an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, and 93% a statin. Echocardiographic follow-up was obtained in 215 patients. There was recovery in LV systolic function as shown by a decrease in wall motion score index and an increase in ejection fraction. There was a significant increase in end-diastolic volume (EDV; 56.4 +/- 14.7 ml/m2 at baseline, 59.3 +/- 15.7 ml/m2 at 3 months, 62.8 +/- 18.7 ml/m2 at 1 year, p <0.0001). LV remodeling (>20% increase in EDV) was observed in 67 patients (31%). Peak creatine kinase level, systolic blood pressure, and wall motion score index were independently associated with changes in EDV. In conclusion, recent improvements in AMI management do not abolish LV remodeling, which remains a relatively frequent event after an initial anterior wall AMI.", 
    "194": "The effect of estrogen on neointimal formation in injured rat arteries has been reported to be a sexual dimorphic effect. Recently, it has been reported that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) exhibit vasoprotective effects, which are independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects. In this study, we examined the gender differences of atorvastatin's effect on neointimal formation in balloon-injured rat arteries. Male and female Sprague Dawley rats underwent gonadectomy and balloon injury of the carotid artery. Ovariectomized female, as well as intact and castrated male, rats exhibited marked neointimal formation. Treatment with atorvastatin significantly reduced neointimal formation at day 14 (14 days after injury) and NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production at day 2 in ovariectomy, but not in intact and castrated males. In ovariectomized rats, 7 days of atorvastatin treatment from days -3 to 3 but not from days 7 to 14 suppressed neointimal formation at day 14. In this study, we showed that atorvastatin's effect on neointimal formation was female-specific and was more marked in ovariectomized female rats. NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production may be involved in the mechanism of the sexual dimorphic response seen in response to atorvastatin treatment. Furthermore, the results suggest the importance of treatment in the early phase after vascular injury.", 
    "195": "Heart rate recovery at 1min (HRR1) is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality. The effects of statins on the autonomic nervous system may account for their beneficial effects in survival. Our aim was to determine if statin therapy improves heart rate recovery in hypercholesterolemic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thirty type 2 diabetic patients without known coronary artery disease and low density lipoprotein cholesterol>100mg/dl and 30 age and sex matched non-diabetic controls were included in a prospective study. Patients with diabetes were treated with simvastatin 40mg/day for 1 year. No lipid-lowering therapy was administered to the control group. Exercise testing with 2min cool-down period was performed at baseline, 6, 12 weeks and at 1 year. The diabetics had significantly lower HRR1 compared with non-diabetics at baseline (19.2+/-5.4bpm versus 24.2+/-4bpm, p<0.0001). Simvastatin therapy significantly improved HRR1 after 12 weeks compared to baseline (19.2+/-5.4bpm versus 24+/-5bpm, p<0.0001) and this improvement remained significant at 1 year (26+/-4.4bpm, p<0.0001 compared to baseline). HRR1 did not change in the control group (p=0.39 by ANOVA). This study demonstrates that treatment with simvastatin might improve the attenuated heart rate recovery of diabetic subjects. In patients with diabetes, the mortality benefit provided by statins might involve their effects on the autonomic nervous system.",

In a multivariate model that included all significant univariate correlates, CACS was independently associated with age (P < 0.0001), waist-hip ratio (P < 0.02), male gender (P < 0.05) and duration of diabetes (P < 0.05), but the association with homocysteine was no longer significant. The negative association between CACS and CRP remained in multivariate analysis, and was independent of statin use.",

    "201": "The fundamental mechanism of statin myopathy remains elusive but is believed to be a class effect. The most common explanation for the cause of toxic muscle injury invokes the deficiency of one of three main synthetic products in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway. Recent studies have revealed several patients with statin-induced rhabdomyolysis who also have metabolic muscle defects, indicating that statin use may unmask presymptomatic metabolic myopathies. Although statin-related myotoxicity is believed to be a noninflammatory, toxic myopathy, experimental evidence suggests that it may be triggered by an autoimmune reaction or, conversely, initiate an autoimmune process. The precise mechanism is uncertain.",

    "203": "Microvascular abnormality is a dominant feature of systemic sclerosis. There is increasing evidence that statins, developed as lipid-lowering drugs, yield profound benefits beyond their lipid-lowering effects. These 'pleiotropic' effects suggest that statins may be beneficial for treating SSc vasculopathy. This review focuses on the action of statins on endothelial functions and their potential use in treating SSc.", 
    "204": "The initial event in the pathogenesis of vascular involvement in SSc has been thought to be endothelial injury, but recent studies have led to another theory--that insufficient vascular repair due to defective vasculogenesis contributes to this process. Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis, but they also suppress the synthesis of other lipid intermediates, resulting in protection of the endothelium through improvements in endothelial function, mobilization of endothelial precursors, suppression of the inflammatory response, and inhibition of fibrosis. Only a few studies evaluating the clinical benefits of statins have been conducted in SSc patients to date, but one open-label study showed that statins might be effective in improving vascular symptoms.", 
    "205": "Statins display numerous effects that may be of potential benefit in preventing endothelial dysfunction in SSc patients. Further clinical trials of statins in SSc patients are warranted."
