    "0": "Cholesterol accumulation and removal are regulated by two different transcription factors. SREBP-2 (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-2) is best known to up-regulate genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake, whereas LXR (liver X receptor) is best known for up-regulating cholesterol efflux genes. An important cholesterol efflux gene that is regulated by LXR is the ATP-binding cassette transporter, ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter-A1). We have previously shown that statin treatment down-regulated ABCA1 expression in human macrophages, probably by inhibiting synthesis of the LXR ligand 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. However, it was subsequently reported that ABCA1 expression is down-regulated by SREBP-2 through binding of SREBP-2 to an E-box element in ABCA1's proximal promoter. As statin treatment induces SREBP-2 activation, this may provide an alternative explanation for the statin-mediated down-regulation of ABCA1. In the present study, we employed a set of CHO (Chinese-hamster ovary) mutant cell lines to investigate the role of SREBP-2 in the regulation of ABCA1. We observed increased ABCA1 mRNA levels in SREBP-2-overexpressing cells and decreased levels in cells lacking a functional SREBP-2 pathway, which were restored when the SREBP-2 pathway was reinstated. Moreover, ABCA1 gene expression was positively associated with synthesis of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol in these cell lines. In studies using a human ABCA1 promoter reporter assay, mutation of the E-box motif had a similar response as the wild-type construct to either statin treatment or addition of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. By contrast, these responses were completely ablated when the DR4 element to which LXR binds was mutated. These results support the idea that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and statin treatment influence ABCA1 transcription via supply of an LXR ligand and not through an SREBP-2/E-box-related mechanism. In addition, our results indicate a critical role of SREBP-2 as a positive regulator of ABCA1 gene expression by enabling the generation of oxysterol ligands for LXR.",

Antiarrhythmic medications have not demonstrated a survival benefit. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have been revalidated in recent studies to improve survival and reduce risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with myocardial infarction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and aldosterone antagonists should also be used in these patients. Data from randomized trials demonstrate significant survival benefit with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and indications have expanded. Patients with established ischemic cardiomyopathy do not require electrophysiologic studies for induction of tachyarrhythmias based on these trials.

In this study we evaluated two major rheological aspects (membrane fluidity and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration) in a group of young adults with AMI. We enrolled 41 AMI patients (39 men and 2 women; mean age 41.0 +/- 4.0 years), who were examined 5-10 days after AMI (T1) and 12 months later (T2). The membrane fluidity was obtained labelling granulocytes with the fluorescent probe 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) and considering the degree of fluorescence polarization, inversely correlated to the membrane lipid fluidity. The cytosolic Ca2+ content was obtained marking PMN cells with the fluorescent probe Fura-2AM and considering the ratio between the Fura 2-Ca2+ complex and the unchelated Fura 2 fluorescence intensity. Both parameters were evaluated at baseline and after in vitro activation with 4-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) at the concentration of 4.5 muM, prolonged for 5 and 15 minutes. At T1 the PMN membrane fluidity and cytosolic Ca2+ content in AMI patients were respectively decreased and increased in comparison with control group. At T2 the membrane fluidity was not any more different from control subjects, but there was also a further increase in cytosolic Ca2+ content. In vitro, PMN activation caused no significant variation of these parameters in the control group, while in AMI patients membrane fluidity significantly decreased and cytosolic Ca2+ content increased not only during the initial stage, but also after 12 months. The long-term functional alteration of PMN cells observed in young adults with AMI confirms the role of these cells in the inflammatory response following AMI. In the light of these data, the use of molecules able to modulate granulocyte activity, such as calcium channel blockers or pentoxifylline, should be reconsidered in myocardial infarction, together with the usual pharmacological treatment.",

Pravastatin (PS, 10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle were given orally for 28 days to Wistar male rats injected or not with monocrotaline (MC, 60 mg/kg intraperitonealy) and treated or not by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 15 mg/kg/day. At 4 weeks, monocrotaline-injected rats developed severe pulmonary hypertension, with an increase in right ventricular pressure (RVP) and right ventricle/left ventricle+septum weight ratio (RV/LV+S), associated with a decrease in pulmonary artery dilation induced either by acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside. Hypertensive pulmonary arteries exhibited an increase in medial thickness, medial wall area, endothelial cell apoptosis, and a decrease of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. Monocrotaline-rat lungs showed a significant decrease of eNOS expression (4080+/-27 vs 12189+/-761 arbitrary density units [ADU] for MC and control groups respectively, P<0.01) and a significant increase of cleaved caspase-3 expression by western blotting (Control=11628+/-2395 vs MC=2326+/-2243 ADU, P<0.05). A non-significant trend toward a reduced mortality was observed with pravastatin (relative risk of death = 0.33; 95% confidence interval [0.08-1.30], P= 0.12 for MC+PS vs MC groups). Pravastatine induced a protection against the development of the pulmonary hypertension (RVP in mmHg: 30+/-3 vs 45+/-4 and RV/LV+S: 0.46+/-0.04 vs 0.62+/-0.05 for MC+PS and MC groups respectively, P<0.05) and was associated with a significant reduction of MC-induced thickening (61+/-6 mum vs 81+/-3 mum for MC+PS and MC groups respectively, P= 0.01) of the medial wall of the small intrapulmonary arteries. Pravastatin partially restored acetylcholine-induced pulmonary artery vasodilation in MC rats (Emax=65+/-5% and 46+/-3% for MC+PS and MC group respectively, P<0.05) but had no effect on acetylcholine-induced pulmonary artery vasodilation in MC+L-NAME rats. It also prevented apoptosis and restored eNOS expression of pulmonary artery endothelial cells, as well as in the whole lung.

In this study, red mold rice (RMR) was added to the diet of Arbor Acres broiler chickens, and the cholesterol level in meat, as well as the concentration of triglyceride, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the serum were evaluated. Four-week-old broilers are studied and divided into four groups in that each group contains 15 subjects. A 3-week experimental feeding trial was conducted in which three groups of broilers were fed 2.0, 5.0, and 8.0% of RMR (RMR groups) within their diet, respectively, and the result was compared to the control group. The results indicated that for each RMR group, the cholesterol content was significantly lower than that of the control group; in addition, their meat products contain higher level of unsaturated fatty acids. Triglyceride and cholesterol concentration in serum was also found to be considerably lower in RMR groups when compared to control group. Finally, in RMR groups, HDL-C/LDL-C and HDL-C/cholesterol ratios were all higher than those of the control group. In short, the results demonstrated that the cholesterol levels could be lowered by adding RMR to the diet of chickens.",

Thereafter, all patients received single-blind amlodipine 5 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg for 8-weeks, followed by 12 weeks of open-label treatment where doses could be titrated to improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure control. A total of 847 patients entered the double-blind phase. At Week 8, 45% of the patients receiving amlodipine 5 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg reached both their blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals, compared with 8.3% with amlodipine (p < 0.001), 28.6% with atorvastatin (p < 0.001), and 3.5% with placebo. At 28 weeks, 67.1% of patients coadministered amlodipine and atorvastatin (mean doses, 7.6 mg and 28.4 mg, respectively) achieved both targets. Framingham estimated 10-year risk of coronary heart disease declined from baseline levels of 15.1% to 6.9% at Week 28.

    "30": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are frequently associated. Cardiovascular morbidity is a major burden in these patients. Furthermore a renal disease appears in 40% of them that may lead to chronic terminal renal failure. Whatever the stage of the renal disease, it increases the cardiovascular risk. A majority of type 2 diabetic patients will eventually died of cardiovascular complications before having reached chronic terminal renal failure. Many large clinical trials including type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension have been performed in the last 20 years with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as primary outcomes. These trials mainly evaluated the role of glycemic control, of hypertension as well as the decrease of LDL-cholesterol. Based on these trials, the prescription type of hypertensive type 2 diabetic patient should include, besides hygienic and dietary advices, antidiabetic treatment, thiazide and/or betablocker and platelet inhibitor. Statin should be prescribed for secondary prevention if serum LDL-cholesterol is above 1,3 g/l and for primary prevention depending on serum LDL-cholesterol and on the number of cardiovascular risk factors. The objectives are an HbA1c below 6,5%, a LDL-cholesterol below 1g/l and a blood pressure below 150/80 mmHg. The appearance of diabetic nephropathy alters the treatment and the therapeutic objectives. Many large trials aimed at preventing microalbuminuria (primary prevention), macroproteinuria (secondary prevention), and chronic renal failure (tertiary prevention) have been conducted. For primary prevention, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors should be prescribed in case of hypertension because they delay the appearance of microalbuminuria. For secondary prevention, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers decrease albuminuria excretion rate and delay the appearance of macroproteinuria whatever the blood pressure. Tertiary prevention is based on angiotensin-receptor blockers since they slow down the decrease of renal function. The objectives are a blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg and the regression or the reduction of albuminuria excretion rate. Intensified and target-driven interventions aimed at multiple risk factors implicated in cardiovascular and renal lesions, as successfully performed in the STENO-2 study, reduce the risk of cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. In this article, large clinical trials having the prevention of cardiovascular and renal risks as primary outcomes were analyzed.", 
    "31": "Renal dysfunction alters the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) profoundly conferring a very high-risk to the patients. Currently strategies are developed to combat CVD and clinical studies test a number of hypothesis. In this setting the results of the 4D study, comparing atorvastatin with placebo on cardiovascular outcomes in 1255 type 2 diabetic patients on maintenance hemodialysis, came as a great and unsuspected surprise. After a median follow-up of 4 years atorvastatin (20 mg/d) decreased the relative risk by 8% (95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.10; P=0.37) despite a high number of cardiovascular events and an overall 24% cardiovascular mortality. This indicates, that the risk in type 2 diabetic patients on hemodialysis origins from factors other than an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype alone. Due to non-significant effects of atorvastatin on the primary endpoint and the different quality of such endpoints in dialysis patients as well as an unexplained higher rate of fatal strokes in atorvastatin treated patients we do not recommend to initiate statin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis therapy at the present time. Statin therapy should be implemented earlier during the course of progressive vascular damage.", 
    "32": "Originally designed to target elevated lipids, the \"traditional\" cause of atherosclerosis, statins might also confer vascular benefit by directly or indirectly modulating both the inflammatory and immune responses. Statins have been shown to downregulate MHC class II and CD40 expression on activated endothelial cells (EC). In this study, we investigate the potential effect of statins on MHC class I expression and regulation in response to IFNgamma. Primary cultures of human ECs have been treated with increasing doses of fluvastatin (0.01; 0.1 and 1 microM) with or without IFNgamma for 48 hours. Surface expression of MHC class I and class II has been analyzed by flow cytometry. Our data indicate that fluvastatin increases MHC class I expression on quiescent ECs by a dose-dependent effect. Furthermore, fluvastatin potentiates the MHC class I upregulation but prevents MHC class II induction triggered by IFNgamma. These effects are reversed by mevalonate. In conclusion, our results suggest that while decreasing MHC class II expression, fluvastatin (at 0.1 and 1 microM) upregulates MHC class I expression on ECs. Functional consequences of statin-mediated modulation of MHC on ECs have still to be elucidated in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "33": "1. In the present study, we investigated the effects of chronic treatment of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) with the statin fluvastatin on vascular Rho/Rho-kinase pathway mediated contraction, which has been shown to be upregulated in hypertension. 2. Contribution of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway to noradrenaline-induced contraction of arteries from SHRSP was assessed by the inhibitory effect of Y-27632, a Rho/Rho-kinase inhibitor. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with fluvastatin (10 mg/kg per day) for 1 month. 3. Treatment with fluvastatin tended to attenuate the contraction to noradrenaline and significantly decreased the Y-27632-sensitive component of the contraction in controls compared with fluvastatin-treated rats. 4. RhoA, as assessed by western blotting, was also reduced by fluvastatin treatment. 5. These findings suggest that chronic treatment with fluvastatin reduces the contractile response associated with Rho/Rho-kinase in arteries of hypertensive rats.", 
    "34": "Aspirin, dipyridamole, cilostazol, thienopyridines and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors represent the classical examples of the established antiplatelet agents commonly used for the secondary prevention in patients after vascular events. Obviously, the era of expanding antiplatelet regimens and indications may require new agents as the substitutes, or additions to the available strategies. However, recent results of the majority of antiplatelet trials strongly suggest boarder line advantages in clinical outcomes, and higher associated bleeding risks with the novel antiplatelet agents or/and regimens. Moreover, unexpected failures, such as lack of efficacy of clopidogrel and aspirin combination for ischaemic stroke prevention (MATCH), or use of the same antiplatelet regimen for the primary vascular prevention (CHARISMA) raise legitimate concerns that the concept 'the more the better' may not be valid. Broad use of statins, angiotensin receptor blockers and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be in part responsible for the lack of impressive results with the antiplatelet therapy because each of these drug classes per se inhibits platelets. In this review, we discuss the available evidence and potential clinical significance of these findings.", 
    "35": "It is increasingly accepted that more intensive lipid-lowering treatment is associated with greater cardiovascular risk reductions in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), thus providing a rationale for more aggressive LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) targets. Ezetimibe in combination with statin therapy provides an additional approach to lipid management by utilising the additive action of two different mechanisms of LDL-C reduction. In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a total of 98 men and 55 women with CHD and primary hypercholesterolaemia, na\u00efve to statin therapy, were randomised to receive treatment for 6 weeks with either ezetimibe 10 mg-simvastatin 20 mg (n = 77) or placebo-simvastatin 20 mg (n = 75). At 6 weeks, ezetimibe 10 mg-simvastatin 20 mg provided a mean additional LDL-C reduction of 14.6% (95% CI 10.1-19.1) compared with simvastatin monotherapy (p < 0.0001). Moreover, a higher proportion of patients on ezetimibe/simvastatin achieved the National Standard Framework LDL-C standard (<3.0 mmol/l; 93% vs. 75%, p < 0.001) or the new Joint British Societies (JBS 2) goal of LDL-C < 2.0 mmol/l (49.3% vs. 11.1%, p < 0.001). On logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio of achieving target LDL-C with ezetimibe 10 mg-simvastatin 20 mg was 5.1 (95% CI 1.8-15.0) times higher than with simvastatin monotherapy (p = 0.003). Clinical chemistry profiles and proportions of adverse events were similar in both groups at baseline and follow-up. In conclusion, ezetimibe 10 mg-simvastatin 20 mg is a practical, effective and safe option for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia in CHD patients, and brings more patients to new aggressive cholesterol targets compared with simvastatin 20 mg monotherapy.",

    "40": "Dyslipdemia is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and contributes to high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of CKD patients. Experimental studies have demonstrated that lipids induce glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury and that lipid-lowering treatments ameliorate renal injury. Therapy with statins not only has the potential to lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD but also to slow progression of renal disease. Whereas the guidelines for treatment of hyperlipidaemia in nonrenal patients are based on prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled mega-trials, such data are not available for CKD patients. This review outlines the limited information currently available on the effect of statins among patients with CKD and summarizes the ongoing randomized trials designed to address this question.",

Not surprisingly, the issue of value for money and cost effectiveness arises. Whilst statin therapy has proven cost effective in patients with established cardiovascular disease this is the first economic evaluation of statin therapy for primary prevention in the Irish healthcare setting. Using economic modelling techniques the incremental cost effectiveness of statin therapy in high risk individuals i.e. 10 year risk exceeding 15% ranged from 17,900 euros per life year gained (LYG) to 33,800 euros/LYG under the GMS scheme. Corresponding figures for the Drug Payment scheme were 24,500 euros/ LYG to 48,500 euros/LYG. All the statins could be considered cost effective i.e. threshold below 50,000 euros/LYG however atorvastatin proved the most cost effective statin in this pharmacoeconomic study.",

Twenty-one cases of rhabdomyolysis confirmed by medical record review were compared to 200 individually matched controls without rhabdomyolysis. A conditional logistic regression model was applied to evaluate the effects of age, gender, comorbidities, concurrent medication use, dosage, and duration of statin use on the development of rhabdomyolysis.",

We also observed a joint effect of high statin dosage and renal disease (p = 0.022). When these two variables were added to the model with age, we obtained an OR of 5.73 for dosage (95%CI: 0.63, 52.6) and 6.26 for renal disease (95%CI: 0.46, 63.38).

    "46": "Circulating bone marrow-derived vascular progenitor cells contribute to angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, and the response to vascular injury. These vascular progenitor cells consist of two cell groups, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and smooth muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs). Although HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been reported to inhibit atherosclerosis partially by increased EPCs, the effects of statins on SMPCs are unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between EPCs and SMPCs and whether pravastatin has atheroprotective effects on SMPCs. Peripheral mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated and cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes in SMPC medium. MNCs were stained with acetylated low density lipoprotein and lectin, or alpha-smooth muscle actin, and cell numbers were counted. mRNA expression and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein synthesis of MNCs were evaluated. Pravastatin significantly increased the number of EPC and decreased the number of SMPC. mRNA expression of VEGF, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, VEGF receptor-2 (KDR), and Akt were up-regulated, and VEGF secretion was increased by pravastatin. The present study demonstrated that pravastatin has promotive effects on the differentiation from MNCs to EPC cells, while inhibitory effects to SMPC cells. Our findings suggest a previously unreported mechanism of the effect of statin therapy on vascular progenitor cells.", 
    "47": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) have been shown to be effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreasing the risk of coronary heart disease. Although safe and well tolerated by most patients, statins have also been associated with muscle-related adverse events. This article reviews statin-associated myotoxicity to clarify the definitions of muscle-related adverse events and discusses their incidences in major statin trials, case reports, and review articles through January 2006. Milder complaints (ie, myalgia) are reported by approximately 5% to 7% of patients who take statins. More severe myotoxicity, namely rhabdomyolysis, is extremely rare for all statins save cerivastatin, and most recent estimates of its incidence are between 0.44 and 0.54 cases per 10 000 person-years. The mechanism of statin-associated myotoxicity has not been satisfactorily defined and is likely due to multiple factors, including membrane instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, and defects in myocyte duplication.", 
    "48": "Prion diseases are fatal and at present there are neither cures nor palliative therapies known/available, which delay disease onset or progression. Cholesterol-lowering drugs have been reported to inhibit prion replication in infected cell cultures and to modulate inflammatory reactions. We aimed to determine whether simvastatin-treatment could delay disease onset in a murine prion model. Groups of mice were intracerebrally infected with two doses of scrapie strain 139A. Simvastatin-treatment commenced 100 days postinfection. The treatment did not affect deposition of misfolded prion protein PrP(res). However, expression of marker proteins for glia activation like major histocompatibility class II and galectin-3 was found to be affected. Analysis of brain cholesterol synthesis and metabolism revealed a mild reduction in cholesterol precursor levels, whereas levels of cholesterol and cholesterol metabolites were unchanged. Simvastatin-treatment significantly delayed disease progression and prolonged survival times in established prion infection of the CNS (p < or = 0.0003). The results suggest that modulation of glial responses and the therapeutic benefit observed in our murine prion model of simvastatin is not due to the cholesterol-lowering effect of this drug.",

All studies reported a significant reduction in perioperative cardiovascular events in statin users compared with nonusers. The safety of perioperative statin use has not yet been fully elaborated, although current evidence suggests there is no extra risk from statin-induced side effects in the perioperative period.",

The relative reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiac events, a composite endpoint comprising cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and coronary intervention procedures, with fluvastatin treatment was not significant for patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency (hazard ratio, 0.83; p=0.18); in this patient subgroup, the incidence of coronary intervention procedures was similar between treatment groups.

    "58": "Many cardiovascular disease states are associated with autonomic dysfunction, specifically sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal. Both these autonomic derangements are independently associated with adverse prognostic outcomes. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity when compared to placebo in subjects with proven coronary artery disease (CAD), including sudden presumed arrhythmic death. As autonomic dysfunction is associated with arrhythmogenesis, statins may be having a beneficial effect on autonomic function in these subjects. We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study examining the effect of rapid short-term lipid lowering with a statin on autonomic function in CAD patients. Ten subjects with proven CAD (8 male, 2 female; mean age 63.4 years) were randomised to receive either 80 mg atorvastatin or placebo over a 4 week period followed by a 4 week washout, then the alternative treatment for a further 4 weeks. Autonomic parameters assessed were plasma noradrenaline levels on recumbency and 80 degrees head-up tilt, cold pressor testing, and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. Plasma noradrenaline levels were significantly reduced (p=0.050) after 20 min rest in the recumbent position, with atorvastatin compared to placebo. A nonsignificant reduction in plasma noradrenaline with atorvastatin compared to placebo was observed in the prolonged 80 degrees head-up position (p=0.207). In addition, sympathovagal balance was shifted to greater vagal predominance with atorvastatin (low-frequency/high-frequency ratio in the HRV frequency domain) when compared to placebo, p=0.06. We found that rapid lipid lowering with atorvastatin reduces sympathetic nervous system in this pilot study of CAD patients. Larger trials are required to definitively address the effects of statins on autonomic activity in these patients.",

In a sub-group analysis of the TNT study, intensive treatment with high-dose atorvastatin significantly reduced hospitalisations for heart failure in patients with stable coronary heart disease, compared with low-dose atorvastatin; this benefit was most evident in patients with a history of heart failure at baseline. In a combined analysis of two studies of darbepoetin alfa, which included 475 patients, treatment increased and maintained haemoglobin levels and produced non-significant improvements in symptoms and morbidity in anaemic heart failure patients compared to placebo. In the FERRIC-HF study (n=35), intravenous iron sucrose therapy improved exercise capacity and symptom status in iron-deficient heart failure patients.

    "67": "The calibration of a solid-state NMR spectrometer requires setting the magic angle, setting the reference and decoupler frequencies, ensuring that the magnetic field is homogeneous across the sample volume, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio, determining the pi/2 pulse durations, and optimizing the Hartman-Hahn matching condition. Each task has one or more widely accepted standards, such as potassium bromide for setting the magic angle, adamantane for optimizing magnet homogeneity, and hexamethylbenzene or glycine for measuring the signal-to-noise ratio. We show that all of these tasks can be performed using 3-methylglutaric acid (MGA). In the case of high-powered decoupling, the CH(2) and CH carbon peaks of MGA provide an opportunity to evaluate the decoupling in a manner that is superior to any of the commonly used standard compounds. Thus, MGA can be used as a single solid-state NMR standard compound to perform all calibration steps except for magnet shimming.", 
    "68": "The impact of the supplementation of cultivation media with B-group vitamins on the biosynthesis of lovastatin (mevinolinic acid) by Aspergillus terreus ATCC20542 was investigated. A hypothesis was formulated that as the biosynthesis of lovastatin requires a high throughput of coenzymes in the cells, the application of its precursors in the form of B-group vitamins might positively influence the process. In a nitrogen-deficient medium the B-group vitamins, both single, especially nicotinamide, pyridoxine and calcium D-pantothenate, and a mixture of thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, calcium d-pantothenate and nicotinamide increased the efficiency of lovastatin biosynthesis. The vitamin supplementation also increased both volumetric and specific production rates of mevinolinic acid, especially before 80 h of the process, when no lactose limitation had been observed yet.", 
    "69": "This study investigates a proposed design of a peptide sequence that is based on a bioactive conformation of statins that act as the competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA for HMGR. To bridge these heterogeneous organic compounds, a conformational aspect relating to an analysis of the flexibility of the peptide molecules and their occupied volumes was applied to the peptide design. The design criterion was formulated in terms of a proximity parameter (Pr), reflecting the probability of an active peptide conformation to approximate the statin. Through a structure-functional analysis of previously synthesized peptides and statin molecules, nine peptides were selected for the peptide library. Comparing the calculated proximity parameters, four peptides (IAVE, YAVE, IVAE, and YVAE) from the library were selected and synthesized. In vitro assays elucidated the inhibition properties for HMGR that are exhibited by these peptides. Among all peptides, YVAE showed the highest ability to inhibit HMGR. A kinetic analysis revealed that this peptide is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA with an equilibrium constant of inhibitor binding (K(i)) of 15.2 +/- 1.4 microM. The calculated coefficient correlation (R) between log (IC(50)) and the inverse value of proximity parameter (1/Pr) was found to be 0.99, indicating a high degree of correlation and efficacy of the given approach in the peptide sequence design.", 
    "70": "Over 100 million prescriptions were filled for statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) in 2004. Statins were originally developed to lower plasma cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia and are the most effective drugs on the market in doing so. Because of the discovered pleiotropic effects of statins, the use has expanded to the treatment of many other conditions, including ventricular arrythmias, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, cancer, osteoporosis, and diabetes. The elderly population is growing. Therefore, it is estimated that the number of statin users will also increase. Fortunately, the use of statins is relatively safe with few side effects. Myopathy is the most common side effect with symptoms ranging from fatigue, weakness, and pain to symptoms associated with rhabdomyolysis which is a life-threatening condition. The development of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is rare occurring in approximately 0.1% of patients; however, the occurrence of less severe symptoms is underreported and may be 1-5% or more. Physical exercise appears to increase the likelihood for the development of myopathy in patients taking statins. It is thought that as many as 25% of statin users who exercise may experience muscle fatigue, weakness, aches, and cramping due to statin therapy and potentially dismissed by the patient and physician. The mechanisms causing statin-induced myopathy have not been elucidated; however, research efforts suggest that apoptosis of myofibers may contribute. The mitochondrion is considered a regulatory center of apoptosis, and therefore its role in the induction of apoptosis will be discussed as well as the mechanism of statin-induced apoptosis and myopathy.", 
    "71": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of bisphosphonates (BPs) and simvastatin on chondrocyte lipid peroxidation. For this purpose, a flow cytometrical method using C11-BODIPY(581/591) was developed to detect hydroperoxide-induced lipid peroxidation in chondrocytes. Tertiary butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) induced a time and concentration dependent increase in chondrocyte lipid peroxidation. Addition of a Fe2+/EDTA complex to t-BHP or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) clearly enhanced lipid peroxidation. The lipophilic simvastatin demonstrated a small inhibition in the chondrocyte lipid peroxidation. None of three tested BPs (clodronate, pamidronate, and risedronate) had an effect on chondrocyte lipid peroxidation induced by t-BHP. However, when Fe2+/EDTA complex was added to t-BHP or H2O2, BPs inhibited the lipid peroxidation process varying from 25% to 58%. This study demonstrates that BPs have antioxidant properties as iron chelators, thereby inhibiting the chondrocyte lipid peroxidation. These findings add evidence to the therapeutic potential of bisphosphonates and statins in rheumatoid arthritis.",

This study explored the time course of these two contributors' roles as tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis progressing, and evaluated the mechanisms of the protective effect of atorvastatin. Unilateral ureteral obstructive (UUO) rats were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/Kg) or vehicle. Expression of osteopontin (OPN) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) was evaluated by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry staining of ED1 was used to assess macrophage accumulation in interstitium. Histological evaluation was performed to semiquantify tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The results showed that on day 3 after UUO operation, OPN expression significantly increased and positively correlated with the number of the interstitial ED1(+) cells, while on day 10, M-CSF expression upregulated and correlated with interstitial ED1(+) cells. In atorvastatin treatment group, the increments of these two factors were attenuated significantly at the two time points, respectively. ED1(+) cell accumulation and fibrosis also ameliorated in the treatment group. For all the samples of UUO and treatment group on day 10, ED1(+) cells also correlated with interstitial fibrosis scores. The results suggest that OPN may induce the early macrophage/monocyte infiltration and M-CSF may play an important role in regulating macrophage accumulation in later stage of UUO nephropathy. Statin treatment decreases interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, and this renoprotective effect may be mediated by downregulating the expression of OPN and M-CSF.",

PAI-1 expression was analyzed by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and PAI-1 antigen measured in supernatants by ELISA. IL-1alpha increased PAI-1 secretion in a genotype-dependent manner, and higher values were observed for 4G/4G compared with both 4G/5G and 5G/5G cultures (P < 0.05). Preincubation of HUVEC with 10 microm pravastatin significantly reduced IL-1-induced PAI-1 expression in 4G/4G HUVEC compared with untreated cultures (177.5% +/- 24.5% vs. 257.9% +/- 39.0%, P < 0.05). Pravastatin also attenuated the amount of secreted PAI-1 by 4G/4G HUVEC after IL-1 stimulation (5020.6 +/- 165.7 ng mL(-1) vs. 4261.1 +/- 309.8 ng mL(-1), P < 0.05). This effect was prevented by coincubation with mevalonate, indicating a dependence on HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.",

The GFR was lower in nephrology than in diabetology and primary care (33 +/- 13 versus 47 +/- 9 and 40 +/- 12 ml/min per 1.73 m2, P < 0.0001). The prevalence of BP target (< 130/80 mmHg) was similarly low in nephrology, diabetology and primary care (14, 13 and 10%, P = 0.421) probably because of insufficient prescription of diuretics and low-salt diet. Whereas the prevalence of the triglycerides target was similar, that of total cholesterol (< 200 mg/dl) was larger in diabetology (63%) than in nephrology and primary care (59 and 46%, P = 0.003) because of greater statin prescription in hypercholesterolemic individuals (70, 50 and 41%, respectively, P = 0.002). The attainment of HbA1c less than 7% was less frequent in diabetology (32%) than in nephrology and primary care (61 and 46%, P = 0.0003) despite a more frequent prescription of insulin/oral agents in diabetology.

LDL-C operates at different levels and through various classic and non-classic mechanisms. In particular, increased or modified LDL enhances platelet function and increases sensitivity of platelets to several naturally occurring agonists. Agents that lower LDL-C in hypercholesterolemic patients have been shown to interfere with platelet function. Several studies, in fact, suggested that statins exert anti-thrombotic effects largely as a result of an anti-platelet activity. Among the other LDL-C-lowering agents those acting by interfering with cholesterol reabsorption from the gut (cholestyramine, colestipol) do not appear to interfere with platelet function, whereas peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists (such as fibrates) can inhibit platelet function. The full potential of these drugs in vascular protection is only just being realized. Further studies are still needed to elucidate the full therapeutic benefits of these agents in plaque stabilization and thrombosis.",

Recent research has identified anti-inflammatory properties of statins. Statins appear to reduce the stability of lipid raft formation with subsequent effects on immune activation and regulation, and also prevent the prenylation of signalling molecules with subsequent downregulation of gene expression. Both these effects result in reduced cytokine, chemokine, and adhesion molecule expression, with effects on cell apoptosis or proliferation. This review considers the evidence for the anti-inflammatory properties of statins in the lung, and how these effects are being applied to research into the role of statins as a novel treatment of respiratory diseases.",

In multivariable analysis, lipid-lowering drug use remained significantly associated with reduced odds of AF (odds ratio [OR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.74), and this effect was larger than that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92) or beta-blockers (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88-1.02).

A concern has been raised that atorvastatin may competitively inhibit the metabolism of the prodrug clopidogrel to its active metabolites by the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme, thereby potentially negating its antiplatelet effect. The 30-day rates of adverse cardiovascular events (composite of death, myocardial infarction, 11 unstable angina, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and repeat revascularization procedures) in unselected 12 patients prescribed clopidogrel after PCI as a function of their exposure to CYP3A4 inhibitors has not been fully resolved.",

The 31P-MRS investigation disclosed no anomaly at rest, and the aerobic function assessed during the postexercise recovery period was normal. On the contrary, the pH recovery kinetics was significantly slowed down as indicated by a reduced proton efflux, which could be ultimately linked to a failure of calcium homeostasis. Overall, our observations indicate a normal mitochondrial function and raise the possibility that statins may unmask a latent pathology involving an impairment of calcium homeostasis such as malignant hyperthermia (MH).",

TGF-beta beta 1 was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An Akt kinase assay kit was used to determine Akt activity. Akt phosphorylation was determined by Western blot.

    "122": "The results show that exposure to oxLDL increased Akt activity and phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. Stimulating with oxLDL increases the incorporation of [ 3 H]-leucine by 1.3 fold and causes a 1.6-fold increase in total protein content. Compared with that for the control group, the percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phase is 19% higher in the oxLDL group. And the secretion of TGF-beta beta 1 is increased when incubated with oxLDL. Wortmannin treatment significantly inhibits the effects induced by oxLDL, indicating that the effect of oxLDL is PI3K dependent. Fluvastatin significantly decreases Akt phosphorylation and activity in a dose-dependent manner. Incorporation of [ 3 H]-leucine, total protein content, cell cycle distribution and TGF-beta beta 1 expression are all attenuated by fluvastatin, and these effects are prevented with mevalonate.", 
    "123": "These results demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt-signaling transduction system is activated by oxLDL, and may mediate the cell hypertrophy and up-regulation of TGF-beta beta 1 expression from TECs. Fluvastatin may inhibit the activity of PI3K/Akt and prevent injury to TECs from oxLDL.",

More men were smokers and had low HDL cholesterol, but more women had elevated total and LDL cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes. More men had Q wave acute myocardial infarction, but more women had angina. Over 5 years, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia decreased substantially from 82.7 to 65%. Eighty-three percent of patients received aspirin and this percentage did not change during the study. The use of diuretics, calcium antagonists and nitrates did not change either. The reported use of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers increased significantly.",

Although the higher use of statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers is encouraging, the fact that most coronary heart disease patients are still not achieving the recommended goals remains a concern. There is real potential to reduce the very high coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality in Croatia.",

    "130": "Ten-year cardiovascular risks and treatment eligibility were determined for each individual in a population of 5603 obtained from the Health Survey of England. Using published costs and evidence of effectiveness the cost-effectiveness of treating each eligible individual was determined over a 10-year time horizon. The marginal cost-effectiveness of additional antihypertensive drugs and increasing doses of statins were determined and a sensitivity analysis was carried out.", 
    "131": "Of the 5603 individuals 27.5% (95% confidence interval, 26.3-28.7%) were eligible for at least one treatment: the majority of these were eligible for all three. Cost per cardiovascular disease event prevented is strongly determined by pretreatment cardiovascular disease risk. In three-quarters of patients eligible for all three treatments, the lowest cost per event prevented was with aspirin and in the remainder with two-drug antihypertensive treatment. The marginal costs per event prevented were highest with the addition of a fourth antihypertensive drug and statins. These findings depend on the use of low-cost antihypertensives but are otherwise robust to a wide range of assumptions.", 
    "132": "Modelling the cost-effectiveness of treatments to prevent cardiovascular disease is feasible and provides valuable information. Cost-effectiveness analysis argues for more widespread use of aspirin and two-drug antihypertensive treatment and against the use of four-drug antihypertensive treatment or statins.", 
    "133": "Recent studies have suggested that statins may play a role in the protection against renal failure which is independent of cholesterol reduction. Activation of RhoGTPases is a key step in renal tubular cells' epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which contributes to renal interstitial fibrosis. We hypothesized that statins could act by inhibiting the synthesis of the isoprenoids, such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which is essential for membrane attachment and biological activity of RhoGTPases, RhoA and Rac1.", 
    "134": "Human proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK2) were used to examine the inhibitory effect of statins on EMT induced with medium conditioned by activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.", 
    "135": "Our study demonstrates that the statins lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin inhibit HK2 cells to undergo EMT. Inhibition of EMT in HK2 cells with these statins resulted in a reduction of RhoA and Rac1 activation in both the cytoplasmic and membrane-bound forms, in preservation of the expression of the epithelial cell markers E-cadherin and cytokeratin-19, and in a decrease in Fn-EDA expression, a marker for the myofibroblast phenotype. The decreased levels of activated RhoA and Rac1 in both the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of the cells were reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and mevalonate, and thus attributable to the inhibition of isoprenylation of RhoGTPases by statins.", 
    "136": "This phenomenon could explain the beneficial effect of statins on EMT and on renal fibrosis prevention.", 
    "137": "Fifty consecutive new cardiology clinic patients who were on statin drug therapy (for an average of 28 months) on their initial visit were evaluated for possible adverse statin effects (myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, memory loss, and peripheral neuropathy). All patients discontinued statin therapy due to side effects and began supplemental CoQ(10) at an average of 240 mg/day upon initial visit. Patients have been followed for an average of 22 months with 84% of the patients followed now for more than 12 months. The prevalence of patient symptoms on initial visit and on most recent follow-up demonstrated a decrease in fatigue from 84% to 16%, myalgia from 64% to 6%, dyspnea from 58% to 12%, memory loss from 8% to 4% and peripheral neuropathy from 10% to 2%. There were two deaths from lung cancer and one death from aortic stenosis with no strokes or myocardial infarctions. Measurements of heart function either improved or remained stable in the majority of patients. We conclude that statin-related side effects, including statin cardiomyopathy, are far more common than previously published and are reversible with the combination of statin discontinuation and supplemental CoQ(10). We saw no adverse consequences from statin discontinuation.", 
    "138": "Nutrition is much more important in prevention of stroke than is appreciated by most physicians. The powerful effects of statin drugs in lowering the levels of fasting cholesterol, combined with an unbalanced focus on fasting lipids (as opposed to postprandial fat and oxidative stress), have led many physicians and patients to believe that diet is relatively unimportant. Because the statins can lower fasting lipids by &50% to 60%, and a low-fat diet only lowers fasting cholesterol by &5% to 10%, this error is perhaps understandable. However, a Cretan Mediterranean diet, which is high in beneficial oils, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and low in cholesterol and animal fat, has been shown to reduce stroke and myocardial infarction by 60% in 4 years compared with the American Heart Association diet. This effect is twice that of simvastatin in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study: a reduction of myocardial infarction by 40% in 6 years. Vitamins for lowering of homocysteine may yet be shown to be beneficial for reduction of stroke; a key issue is the high prevalence of unrecognized deficiency of vitamin B(12), requiring higher doses of vitamin B(12) than have been used in clinical trials to date. Efforts to duplicate with supplementation the evidence of benefit for vitamins E, C, and beta carotene have been largely fruitless. This may be related to the broad combination of antioxidants included in a healthy diet. A Cretan Mediterranean diet is probably more effective because it provides a wide range of antioxidants from fruits and vegetables of all colors.",

The present study consisted of a pre-specified subset of these subjects divided into patients receiving (n = 1352) and not receiving (n = 1314) preoperative statin therapy. To control for potential bias related to use of statin therapy, the study estimated propensity scores by logistic regression to determine the predicted probability of inclusion in the \"statin\" group. Multivariate, stepwise logistic regression was then performed, controlling for patient demographics, medical history, operative characteristics, and propensity score to determine whether preoperative statin therapy was independently associated with a reduction in the risk of early (DOS-POD3) cardiac death and/or nonfatal, in-hospital postoperative myocardial infarction.",

Discontinuation of statin therapy after surgery was independently associated with a significant increase in late (POD4-discharge) all-cause mortality (adjusted OR 2.64; 95% CI 1.32-5.26) compared with continuation of statin therapy (2.64% vs 0.60%; P < .01). This was true even when controlling for the postoperative discontinuation of aspirin, beta-blocker, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. Discontinuation of statin therapy after surgery was also independently associated with a significant increase in late cardiac mortality (adjusted OR 2.95; 95% CI 1.31-6.66) compared with continuation of statin therapy (1.91% vs 0.45%; P < 0.01).", 
    "142": "Preoperative statin use is associated with reduced cardiac mortality after primary, elective coronary artery bypass grafting.

    "143": "Inhibition of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase and the downstream mevalonate pathway is in part responsible for the beneficial effects that statins exert on the cardiovascular system. In this study we aimed at analysing the stabilizing effects of fluvastatin on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, using an in vitro co-culture model of ECV304 and C6, or primary bovine endothelial cells and rat astrocytes. Fluvastatin dose-dependently (1-25 micromol/l) increased barrier integrity as analysed by measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). This effect (117.4+/-2.6% at 25 micromol/l) was significantly reduced by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NMMA (300 micromol/l; P<0.01, n=4). The fluvastatin-induced increase of intracellular NO, as analysed by confocal DAF-fluorescence imaging, and the increase in TEER values were significantly reduced in the presence of the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP; 10 micromol/l), whereas farnesyl pyrophosphate had no effect. Immunofluorescent detection of phosphorylated myosin light chains (MLC) revealed a fluvastatin-induced (25 micromol/l) significant reduction of MLC phosphorylation (85.4+/-2.7% control, P<0.001, n=20). This effect was absent if the MLC phosphatase was blocked by calyculin (10 nmol/l). In conclusion, our data demonstrate a BBB stabilizing effect of fluvastatin that correlates with the NO-dependent dephosphorylation of endothelial MLC via the MLC phosphatase.",

There is speculation that a decrease in CoQ10 levels may be associated with statin-induced myopathy. The cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe increases endogenous cholesterol synthesis. The purpose of this study was to examine (i) the effects of ezetimibe and simvastatin on plasma CoQ10 levels and (ii) whether ezetimibe coadministered with simvastatin abrogates the suggested statin-induced decrease in the CoQ10 plasma levels.",

There was a correlation between the percentage change in the levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and the percentage change in CoQ10 levels in all treatment groups (correlation coefficient [R] = 0.67, p < 0.0001).

There is a significant correlation between the CoQ10 level decrease and the decrease in total and LDL-C levels in all three treatment groups, suggesting that the CoQ10 decrease may reflect the decrease in the levels of its lipoprotein carriers and might not be statin-specific. The statin-associated CoQ10 reduction is not abrogated through ezetimibe coadministration. Changes of CoQ10 levels are independent of cholesterol synthesis and absorption.", 
    "148": "Mechanism of the fibrates action is mediated by nuclear PPARalpha receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor). These receptors regulate a number of genes that are involved both in lipids and lipoproteins metabolism and other mediators (e.g. inflammatory mediatores). Due to PPARalpha activation by fibrates, triglycerides and small dense LDL concentration is decreased, HDL cholesterol is increased and both inflammation and prothrombotic status are reduced. These effects are very important in patients with metabolic syndrom.",

Due to the efficacy of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, increasing interest has been shown in establishing the safety of these drugs in NAFLD. In this study, the relationship between statin use, hepatic triglyceride content (HTGC), and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels was examined in 2,264 Dallas Heart Study participants who were using no lipid-lowering agent (n = 2,124) or using only a statin for lipid management (n = 140). Statin use was not associated with a greater frequency of hepatic steatosis (38% vs. 34%) or elevated serum ALT (15% vs. 13%) by a pair-matched analysis. Statin use was also not associated with a greater prevalence of elevated serum ALT among subjects with hepatic steatosis (n = 638). This finding persisted when controlling for possible sample bias as a result of current prescribing practices for statins. Among subjects with serum lipid abnormalities who were not using a statin, hepatic steatosis was present in 60% of those with mixed hyperlipidemia and 83% of those with both mixed hyperlipidemia and an elevated serum ALT. In conclusion, statin use was not associated with a higher frequency of hepatic steatosis or serum ALT abnormalities, even among those with hepatic steatosis. Individuals meeting criteria for statin therapy are likely to have coexistent hepatic steatosis.", 
    "150": "Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at a markedly higher risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with evidence indicating that risk-reduction pharmacotherapy can serve to attenuate cardiovascular events in these patients. Given the central role of vascular surgeons in the treatment of patients with PAD, we sought to determine their perceptions and knowledge of risk-reduction pharmacotherapy in patients with PAD. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 79 Canadian vascular surgeons who attended the 2004 annual meeting of the Canadian Society for Vascular Surgery, the largest and most representative meeting of its kind in Canada. The recommended targets of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood glucose, and blood pressure were known to 53.8%, 40.4%, and 57.7% of vascular surgeons, respectively. The majority of vascular surgeons (65.4%) reported screening for risk factors in <50% of cases. Although 90.4% of vascular surgeons would recommend antiplatelet therapy for PAD, only 5.8% would recommend angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and 19.2% would recommend lipid-lowering therapy with statins. Eighty-four percent of Canadian vascular surgeons indicated that their self-assessment of risk reduction in PAD was average to below average, yet 90.4% of them believed that risk-reduction therapy should be recommended or initiated by vascular surgeons. Canadian vascular surgeons' perceptions toward risk reduction in PAD identify knowledge and action gaps, despite the recognition that recommending and instituting therapy is important to patient care. Given the heightened risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with PAD, these data have important implications.", 
    "151": "In recent years, the process of the programmed cell death has gained much interest because it has important pathophysiological consequences contributing to the deletion of unwanted cells in the vessel wall, loss of pulmonary smooth muscle cells and therefore in reversing the pulmonary pressure. For the reason that most patients with pulmonary hypertension present with limited reversibility with vasodilators, antiremodeling approach for treatment appears to be feasible. Induction or enhancement of vascular smooth muscle cells apoptosis may be targeted to develop novel therapeutic approaches for pulmonary vascular remodeling in patients with pulmonary hypertension. This review summarizes the current mechanisms, investigate the roles and provide novel insights into the potential therapeutic value of apoptosis in the pulmonary artery remodeling of pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "152": "This study characterized immunomodulatory targets of statins in humans and their potential for treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RR MS). Statins inhibited the proliferative response of mononuclear cells. Simvastatin, the statin with the strongest antiproliferative effect, inhibited IFN-gamma-induced expression of MHC class II DR on monocytes and decreased their antigen presenting capacity. As for T lymphocytes, it inhibited their activation and expression of the Th1 lineage differentiation markers. Simvastatin inhibited IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2 secretion, as well as the expression of T-bet, a transcription factor that regulates Th1 cell differentiation.",

    "154": "ApoE genotypes were studied in a group (n = 815) of well-characterised male coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who participated in the lipid-lowering regression study 'Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS)'.", 
    "155": "There was a significant interaction between treatment (placebo/pravastatin) and APOE genotype when lipid levels were considered, APOE2 + carriers exhibited the largest improvement of HDL levels (+0.15 mmol/l) and LDL/HDL ratios (-0.60) compared with APOE3 + (+ 0.06 mmol/l, -0.043, respectively) and APOE4 + carriers (+ 0.07 mmol/l, -0.040). In contrast,APOE2 + allele carriers had the least effect in terms of angiographic parameters, although the difference was not statistically significant.",

    "157": "Beyond lipid lowering, statins have pleiotropic effects with favourable benefits against atherogenesis. Withdrawal of statin therapy has been demonstrated to abrogate vascular protective activity and even increase the incidence of thrombotic vascular events. The purpose of this study is to investigate the serial changes of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) and two adipocytokines, adiponectin and resistin, after short-term atorvastatin therapy and withdrawal in patients with hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "158": "Thirty-two patients with hypercholesterolaemia received atorvastatin 10 mg/day for 3 months. Serum lipid profiles, and levels of sCD40L, adiponectin and resistin, were assessed before and immediately after 3 months' statin therapy. Serum levels of sCD40L and adiponectin were also measured on the 3 consecutive days after statin withdrawal. After 3 months' statin therapy, levels of sCD40L (1.93 +/- 1.13 vs. 1.30 +/- 0.97 ng/mL), total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were all reduced significantly (p < 0.05). However, sCD40L level tended to increase towards baseline on the first and second days after statin withdrawal, but was not significantly elevated until the third day after withdrawal (1.89 +/- 1.28 vs. 1.30 +/- 0.97 ng/mL, p < 0.05). Total cholesterol and LDL-C levels did not increase during the 3 days of statin withdrawal. No significant changes of adiponectin and resistin levels were shown after statin therapy.",

    "160": "Progesterone receptor (PR) stimulation promotes survival in human and rat periovulatory granulosa cells. PR antagonists, Org 31710 and RU 486, both increase apoptosis and decrease cholesterol synthesis in these cells. The decrease in cholesterol synthesis also causes decreased synthesis of other products branching from the cholesterol synthesis pathway, including substrates for protein prenylation. In this study we focus on the link between apoptosis and prenylation in human periovulatory granulosa cells. A decreased cholesterol synthesis and increased apoptosis was verified in experiments with human periovulatory granulosa cells treated with the PR antagonists Org 31710 or RU 486 by measuring caspase-3/7 activity and incorporation of 14C-acetate into cholesterol and progesterone. Correspondingly, specific inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in periovulatory human granulosa cells using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin or simvastatin) increased apoptosis, measured as caspase-3/7 activity. The increase in apoptosis caused by simvastatin or Org 31710 was partially reversed by addition of the protein prenylation precursors farnesol or geranylgeraniol. In addition, the prenylation inhibitors FTI R115777 and GGTI 2147 increased apoptosis in these cells. In conclusion our data suggest that PR antagonists increase apoptosis and reduce cholesterol synthesis in periovulatory granulosa cells and that the resulting depletion of substrates for protein prenylation may contribute to the increased apoptosis sensitivity.", 
    "161": "Discrepant results have been reported on association between treatment with lipid lowering drugs and fracture risk. Several studies have failed to demonstrate an effect of statins on bone mineral density. Therefore, the epidemiological findings of a reduced fracture risk may be due to selections bias, e.g. a healthy drug user effect. If so, the reduced fracture risk is most likely independent of type of lipid lowering drug.",

Risk of hip fracture decreased with increased accumulated dose of statins. This was true in men and in women and in subjects younger and older than 65 years of age. However, fracture risk was not reduced in patients treated with pravastatin (adj. OR 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89-1.17) or non-statin lipid lowering drugs (adj. OR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.86-1.15).",

Twenty HIV-infected patients were randomly assigned to receive ezetimibe 10 mg/day or fluvastatin 80 mg/day. Patients receiving ezetimibe experienced a statistically significant (P = 0.003) 20% reduction in the concentration of LDL-cholesterol, similar to that observed with fluvastatin (24%, P between groups 0.70). We concluded that ezetimibe monotherapy effectively decreases LDL-cholesterol in HIV-infected patients.", 
    "167": "High serum cholesterol is associated with ischemic heart disease. Recent reports also indicate that cholesterol modulates amyloid beta-peptide interactions in the brain. Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the rate-limiting enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis. Statin treatment significantly reduces the levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). In the past decade, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity has been reduced by the use of statins. However, evidence from in vivo and in vitro research has indicated that statins may confer multiple effects because of the inhibition of the production of intermediates in the mevalonate pathway. The aim of this review was to discuss the biological effects of statins on regulation of processes involved in the pathogenesis of dementia.", 
    "168": "Many of the known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with cholesterol metabolism. Interestingly, it seems as if higher doses of statins, i.e. inhibitors of the cholesterol biosynthesis by blocking formation of mevalonate, might lower the progression of AD. The mechanisms, however, by which statins or cholesterol levels exert their influence are unknown. A hereditary cholesterol-storage disorder, Niemann Pick C, shows Alzheimer-like tau-pathology in youth or adolescence but with no amyloid plaques. This gives rise to the possibility that disturbances in cholesterol metabolism induce changes in tau without interposition of Abeta-protein aggregates. Experimental data suggest that manipulation of cholesterol levels may lead to changes in tau phosphorylation. These changes vary depending on how cholesterol metabolism is manipulated. Effects seem to be either mild and transient, or drastic and related to neurodegeneration, or independent of the mevalonate pathway.", 
    "169": "According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, both familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by the toxic effect of over-production and/or aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta). Recent cell and animal studies have linked the production of Abeta to high levels of cholesterol and the use of statins, compounds inhibiting the de novo synthesis of cholesterol. Epidemiological studies have also supported such linkage by showing a reduced prevalence of AD for subjects taking statins. A limited number of clinical studies have been published trying to elucidate the effect of statin treatment on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and metabolism of brain cholesterol in AD in humans and this review focuses on the current state of these clinical studies. The results are contradictory, but the overall interpretation suggests that statin treatment probably does not have a direct impact through lowering of cholesterol on the APP processing and Abeta production in humans. To confirm this, further clinical studies needs to be performed with extended treatment periods and where several parameters (lipid profile, lipoproteins, sterols, biomarkers related to AD and APP metabolites) are analyzed, both in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. The pleiotropic effects of statins should be investigated further. One approach is presented in this review.", 
    "170": "Previous studies have suggested that statin therapy may be of benefit in treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). We initiated a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized (1:1) trial with a 1-year exposure to once-daily atorvastatin calcium (80 mg; two 40 mg tablets) or placebo among individuals with mild-to-moderate AD [Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 12-28]. Stable dose use of cholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen and vitamin E was allowed, as was the use of most other medications in the treatment of co-morbidities. We demonstrated that atorvastatin treatment produced significantly (P = 0.003) improved performance on cognition and memory after 6 months of treatment (ADAS-cog) among patients with mild-to-moderate AD. This superior effect persisted at 1 year (P = 0.055). This positive effect on the ADAS-cog performance after 6 months of treatment was more prominent among individuals entering the trial with higher MMSE scores (P = 0.054). Benefit on other clinical measures was identified in the atorvastatin-treated population compared with placebo. Accordingly, atorvastatin therapy may be of benefit in the treatment of mild-to-moderately affected AD patients, but the level of benefit produced may be predicated on earlier treatment. Evidence also suggests that atorvastatin may slow the progression of mild-to-moderate AD, thereby prolonging the quality of an afflicted individual's life.", 
    "171": "This paper reviews epidemiological and clinical trials data about whether statin use reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The available information has come in three waves. The initial, mostly cross-sectional observational reports suggested that statins might prevent dementia. Next, two large clinical trials with cognitive add-on studies showed no benefit and neither did the third wave, again with observational studies. The latter were mostly longitudinal, and were critical of the first studies for not adequately addressing confounding by indication (i.e. that patients with dementia would be denied statins). Most recently, new data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging have produced a mixed result. While methodological considerations are clearly important in understanding why the reports are so variable, there might also be merit in differentiating between statins, based on their presumed - and variable - mechanisms of action in dementia prevention, before concluding that the initial reports are entirely artefactual. Still, the first reports appear to have overestimated the extent of protection, so that unless there are important effects achievable with specific statins, a more than a modest role for statins in preventing AD seems unlikely.", 
    "172": "This communication integrates the purported role of cholesterol and statins in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with recent data. Meta-analysis of association studies relevant to AD indicates that apolipoprotein (apo)E4 is the only cholesterol-related polymorphism that shows clear association with AD. This suggests that the effect of apoE4 on the pathophysiology of AD occurs via a mechanism that is not directly related to cholesterol, such as fibrillization of Abeta. Despite the lack of genetic association, cholesterol and statins clearly modulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in cell culture and animal models. Statins appear to act by a pleiotropic mechanism, involving both cholesterol (via lipid rafts) and isoprenylation. The pleiotropic mechanism of statin action clarifies conflicting data from clinical studies, where statins exert an action on Abeta and AD that might be dose dependent because of actions on both cholesterol and isoprenylation. Reduced isoprenylation can also inhibit inflammation. Our own studies of brains from Alzheimer subjects +/- statins indicate that statins inhibit inflammation in humans but might not reduce cerebral Abeta load. These results suggest that the primary action of statins in humans with AD might be to reduce inflammation rather than decrease Abeta load.",

The antinociceptive effect of atorvastatin on LPS-induced hypernociception was prevented by mevalonate co-treatment without affecting serum cholesterol levels. Hypernociception induced by PGE(2) was inhibited by atorvastatin, suggesting intracellular antinociceptive mechanisms for atorvastatin.
