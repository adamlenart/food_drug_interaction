In vivo MRI visualized thickened abdominal aortas on both T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images (T1 spin echo, 20 axial slices per animal; T2 spin echo, 28 slices per animal). Seventy-two hours after MION-47 injection, aortas exhibited lower T2 signal intensity compared with before contrast imaging (signal intensity ratio, aortic wall/muscle: before, 1.44 \u00b1 0.26 versus after, 0.95 \u00b1 0.22; 164 slices; P<0.01), whereas T1 spin echo images showed no significant change. MRI on ex vivo specimens provided similar results. Histological studies colocalized iron accumulation with immunoreactive macrophages in atheromata. The magnitude of signal intensity reduction on T2 spin echo in vivo images further correlated with macrophage areas in situ (150 slices; r=0.73). Treatment with rosuvastatin for 3 months yielded diminished macrophage content (P<0.05) and reversed T2 signal intensity changes (P<0.005). Signal changes in rosuvastatin-treated rabbits correlated with reduced macrophage burden (r=0.73). In vitro validation studies showed concentration-dependent MION-47 uptake by human primary macrophages.",

    "3": "A biodegradable porous starch foam (BPSF) was developed for the first time as a carrier in order to improve the dissolution and enhance the oral bioavailability of lovastatin - defined as a model poorly water soluble BCS type II drug. In this paper, BPSF was prepared by the solvent exchange method and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis in order to perform the morphological and structural characterization of BPSF. Lovastatin was loaded by immersion/solvent evaporation into the BPSF which provided a stable hydrophilic matrix with a nano-porous structure. The solid state properties of the loaded BPSF samples were characterized by SEM, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In vitro and in vivo drug release studies showed that when BPSF was used as a carrier it allowed immediate release of lovastatin and enhanced the dissolution rate in comparison with crystalline lovastatin and commercial capsules. These results provide important information about the mechanism of drug adsorption and release from BPSF as a carrier. Accordingly, BPSF has a promising future as a device for the oral delivery of poorly water soluble drugs.",

However, its role following cerebral ischemia is not completely understood yet. We evaluated the effect of ATV treatment on the synaptic adhesion proteins after a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) model in rats. Ischemic male Wistar rats were treated with 10 mg/kg ATV. The first dose was 6 hr after reperfusion, then every 24 hr for 3days. Our findings showed that ATV treatment produced an increase in pAkt ser473 and a decrease in pMAPK 44/42 protein levels 12 and 24 hr postischemia in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. However, p120 catenin and \u03b1N-catenin became drastically increased throughout the temporal course of postischemia treatment (12-72 hr), mainly in the hippocampus. Neurological recovery was observed at 48 and 72 hr, supported by a significant reduction of infarct volume, neuronal loss, and glial hyperreactivity after 72 hr of postischemia treatment with ATV. ATV treatment also up-regulated the association of p120(ctn) , \u03b1N-catenin to PSD-95, accompanied by a reduction of RhoA activation and the recovery of MAP2 immunoreactivity, these being significantly affected by the focal cerebral ischemia. Our findings suggested that p120(ctn) and \u03b1N-catenin synaptic adhesion proteins are crucial molecular targets in ATV-mediated neuroprotection and neuronal plasticity after focal cerebral ischemia.",

TR\u03b2 is predominant in liver and mainly responsible for effects on cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism, whereas TR\u03b1 is most important in fat, muscle, and heart. Thyroid hormone analogs (thyromimetics, tiromes) have been developed that activate TR\u03b2 and are selectively taken up and/or activated by the liver. Such compounds stimulate hepatic LDL receptors, cholesterol elimination as bile acids and cholesterol, and presumably promote reverse cholesterol transport. In animals, they retard atherosclerosis progression. In humans, eprotirome exerts favorable lipid-modulating effects while lacking thyroid hormone-related side-effects and maintaining normal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid feedback.

    "36": "Hypertension is associated with heightened cardiac sympathetic drive whilst statins reduce angiotensin II (ATII) signalling, superoxide anion production and increase nitric oxide bioavailability, events that can potentially reduce peripheral cardiac sympathetic neurotransmission. We therefore investigated whether pravastatin alters peripheral cardiac sympathetic control in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). SHRs (16-18 weeks) had significantly (p<0.05) enhanced atrial (3)H-norepinephrine ((3)H-NE) release to field stimulation compared to normotensive WKYs. 2-week pravastatin supplementation significantly reduced (3)H-NE release to levels observed in the WKY. In-vivo, pravastatin lowered resting heart rate (HR) in the SHR despite not affecting arterial blood pressure or serum cholesterol. In SHR atria/right stellate ganglion preparations, the HR response to stellate stimulation (1, 3, and 5 Hz) was also significantly reduced by pravastatin whilst the HR response to exogenous NE (0.025-5 \u03bcmol) remained similar. The nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NAME (1 mmol/l) increased (3)H-NE release by similar amounts in atria from supplemented and non-supplemented SHRs, whilst Western blotting showed no difference in protein levels of nNOS, eNOS, guanylyl cyclase, or the NADPH oxidase subunits Gp91 and P40 phox. Pravastatin significantly reduced cardiac ATII levels and angiotensin converting enzyme 1 and 2 expressions whilst protein levels of the ATII receptor (ATR(1)) remained unchanged in the SHR. Immunohistochemistry co-localised ATR(1) with tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the stellate ganglion. The ATR(1) antagonist Losartan (5 \u03bcmol) equalised release of (3)H-NE to comparable levels in supplemented and non-supplemented SHRs. These results suggest 2-week pravastatin treatment reduces cardiac ATII, and prevents its facilitatory effect on NE release thus normalising cardiac sympathetic hyper-responsiveness in SHRs.", 
    "37": "Garlic extracts have been shown to decrease drug exposure for saquinavir, a P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 3A4 substrate. In order to explore the underlying mechanisms and to study the effects of garlic on pre-systemic drug elimination, healthy volunteers were administered garlic extract for 21 days. Prior to and at the end of this period, expression of duodenal P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 3A4 protein were assayed and normalized to villin, while hepatic cytochrome P450 3A4 function and simvastatin, pravastatin and saquinavir pharmacokinetics were also evaluated. Ingestion of garlic extract increased expression of duodenal P-glycoprotein to 131% (95% CI, 105-163%), without increasing the expression of cytochrome P450 3A4 which amounted to 87% (95% CI, 67-112%), relative to baseline in both cases. For the erythromycin breath test performed, the average result was 96% (95% CI, 83-112%). Ingestion of garlic extract had no effect on drug and metabolite AUCs following a single dose of simvastatin or pravastatin, although the average area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of saquinavir decreased to 85% (95% CI, 66-109%), and changes in intestinal P-glycoprotein expression negatively correlated with this change. In conclusion, garlic extract induces intestinal expression of P-glycoprotein independent of cytochrome P450 3A4 in human intestine and liver.", 
    "38": "The mevalonate pathway accounts for conversion of acetyl-CoA to isopentenyl 5-diphosphate, the versatile precursor of polyisoprenoid metabolites and natural products. The pathway functions in most eukaryotes, archaea, and some eubacteria. Only recently has much of the functional and structural basis for this metabolism been reported. The biosynthetic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA synthase reactions rely on key amino acids that are different but are situated in active sites that are similar throughout the family of initial condensation enzymes. Both bacterial and animal HMG-CoA reductases have been extensively studied and the contrasts between these proteins and their interactions with statin inhibitors defined. The conversion of mevalonic acid to isopentenyl 5-diphosphate involves three ATP-dependent phosphorylation reactions. While bacterial enzymes responsible for these three reactions share a common protein fold, animal enzymes differ in this respect as the recently reported structure of human phosphomevalonate kinase demonstrates. There are significant contrasts between observations on metabolite inhibition of mevalonate phosphorylation in bacteria and animals. The structural basis for these contrasts has also recently been reported. Alternatives to the phosphomevalonate kinase and mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase reactions may exist in archaea. Thus, new details regarding isopentenyl diphosphate synthesis from acetyl-CoA continue to emerge.", 
    "39": "Statin therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated a LDL-independent action of these class of drugs, which appears in modulating endothelial function, inflammation and thrombosis. Periprocedural myocardial infarction and contrast-induced nephropathy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), associated with worse outcome on long-term follow-up, are both complications related to inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms. Randomized studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of short-term statin pretreatment in reducing periprocedural cardiac marker release in patients undergoing PCI. Statin therapy before elective PCI reduces periprocedural myocardial infarction in patients with stable angina. Furthermore, an acute loading with a high dose of atorvastatin prevents myocardial damage in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing early PCI (<48 h). In patients already on chronic statin therapy, a reload with high-dose statins was associated with a significant improvement on 30-day major adverse cardiac event rates. Furthermore, statin therapy at the time of PCI significantly decreased the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy. This evidence suggests an 'upstream administration' of short-term, high-dose statins in all patients undergoing PCI.",

Athymic nude mice implanted with BEL-7402 cells were given celecoxib and fluvastatin, either alone or in combination, and the effect of treatment on tumour growth was evaluated after 6 weeks. The combination of celecoxib and fluvastatin enhanced inhibition of tumour growth, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of tumour cell proliferation, and inhibition of tumour angiogenesis compared with either treatment alone. The combination of celecoxib and fluvastatin also increased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1), decreased levels of p-Akt, myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) and survivin protein, but had no effect on Akt protein levels in tumours.

Analyses of lipid molecular species by dynamic quantitative mass spectrometry and concomitant transcriptomic measurements define the lipidome and demonstrate immediate responses in fatty acid metabolism represented by increases in eicosanoid synthesis and delayed responses characterized by sphingolipid and sterol biosynthesis. Lipid remodeling of glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and prenols also take place, indicating that activation of the innate immune system by inflammatory mediators leads to alterations in a majority of mammalian lipid categories, including unanticipated effects of a statin drug. Our studies provide a systems-level view of lipid metabolism and reveal significant connections between lipid and cell signaling and biochemical pathways that contribute to innate immune responses and to pharmacological perturbations.",

Quantification was carried out using a photodiode array UV detector at 245 nm over the concentration range of 0.5-10 microg/mL for ROS and EZE. The HPTLC separation was carried out on an aluminum-backed sheet of silica gel 60F(254) layers using n-butyl acetate-chloroform-glacial acetic acid (1 + 8 + 1, v/v/v) mobile phase. Quantification was achieved with UV densitometry at 245 nm over a concentration range of 0.1-0.9 micro/spot for ROS and EZE. The analytical methods were validated according to International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. Low RSD values indicated good precision.

In the present study, the protective effects of atorvastatin on irradiated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and the possible mechanisms were explored. Cultured HUVEC were treated by atorvastatin at a final concentration of 10 \u00b5 mol/ml for 10 minutes, and then irradiated at a dose of 2 Gy or 25 Gy. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, apoptosis of HUVEC was monitored by flow cytometry, and the expression of thrombomodulin (TM) and protein C activation in HUVEC was respectively assessed by flow cytometry and spectrophotometry. After treatment with atorvastatin for 24 h, the rate of cell apoptosis decreased by 6% and 16% in cells irradiated with 2 Gy and 25 Gy, respectively. TM expression increased by 77%, 59%, and 61% in untreated cells, 2 Gy irradiation-treated cells, and 25 Gy irradiation-treated cells, respectively. The protein C levels in 2 Gy and 25 Gy irradiation-treated cells were reduced by 23% and 34% when compared with untreated cells, but up-regulated by 79% and 76% when compared with cells which were irradiated and treated with atorvastatin. In conclusion, these data indicate that atorvastatin exerts protective effects on irradiated HUVEC by reducing apoptosis by up-regulating TM expression and enhancing protein C activation in irradiated HUVEC.",

Large outcome trials designed to assess the value of combining statins with other agents to target HDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol will not be completed for a few years, but there is ample evidence for the clinician to consider combination therapy. The choices for therapies to supplement statins include niacin, fibrates, and omega-3 fatty acids. We present the argument that after therapeutic lifestyle changes, the first priority should be the maximally tolerated effective dose of a potent statin. Evidence supports the addition of niacin as the second agent. In some situations, high-dose omega-3 fatty acid therapy could be the first agent added to statins. Although fibrate monotherapy alone or in combination with non-statin low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering agents can be effective in mixed hyperlipidemia when statins are not tolerated, the combination of statin+fibrate should be considered second-line therapy until the efficacy and safety are established.",

    "88": "Relevant articles on the role of statins in acute ischemic stroke were identified via MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and by manual searches of the references of identified papers. Clinical studies (most were prospective cohort studies) assessing statin therapy for acute ischemic stroke were selected for the review. Only two randomized controlled clinical trials met the criteria to be included in the analysis. Clinical outcome was assessed based on the degree of disability determined with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel index (BI). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used to measure stroke severity. Recurrence of stroke in patients who had suffered from a previous stroke was analyzed with and without statin therapy. Incidence and severity of adverse reactions was reviewed.

    "91": "Cocktail treatment is an effective multidrug medication therapy for some diseases, such as cancer and AIDS, because of the additive or synergistic effect of each medicine and relief from adverse effects. Amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2), which is now recognized as central to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is derived from the sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases. Secretase inhibitors are one of most attractive targets for therapeutic intervention in AD. However, because \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases cleave not only APP but also other substrate proteins, strong inhibition of these secretases leads to severe adverse effects. Some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) can modify the production of A\u03b2. Here, we report that a cocktail treatment with four drugs (NSAID, statin, and \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase inhibitors) had additive effects on the reduction of A\u03b2 levels in cultured cells without competing with each other. Moreover, the four-drug cocktail treatment caused no changes in processing of the \u03b3-secretase substrate Notch. This is suggests that this cocktail treatment could be a new therapeutic approach for AD.", 
    "92": "The field of palliative care and hospice has gained accreditation, with a growing cadre of specialists being trained, but there is a dearth of robust research evidence to guide clinical practice. After 2 years of planning, a group of senior investigators convened in January 2010 to explore the possibility of forming a research cooperative group dedicated to advancing the evidence base in palliative care and hospice. The meeting launched the Palliative Care Research Cooperative (PCRC) with an initial national/international membership, and a plan for developing policies and procedures. Proof of the concept for the PCRC is being established through the design, conduct, and dissemination of a multi-site clinical trial targeting a consensually selected, clinically relevant research question: Should patients who are taking statins for primary or secondary prevention, and who have a prognosis of < 6 months, discontinue these medications? A core group of PCRC members have developed the flagship study for the PCRC, evaluating the discontinuation of statin medications in the palliative care setting. Using the proposed trial as a case study, we underscore several approaches to overcoming common research challenges in end-of-life settings, including: 1) study design, to ensure feasibility and timeliness; 2) strategies to overcome barriers to research in this population; 3) data collection and management, to reduce the burden on patients, caregivers, research personnel, and sites while maximizing quality and efficiency; and 4) agenda setting. This article describes the rationale for convening the PCRC and highlights core principles for developing the evidence base in palliative medicine.",

    "97": "Epileptogenesis is defined as the process of developing epilepsy - a disorder characterized by recurrent seizures - following an initial insult. Neuronal death, aberrant synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation play essential roles in epileptogenesis. An effective neuroprotective therapeutic agent should counteract one or, ideally, all the above-mentioned mechanisms. However, antiepileptic drugs obtainable nowadays can only suppress seizures, without antiepileptogenic effects. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a member of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family that remodels the extracellular matrix. Recently, cumulative evidence indicates that MMP-9, a key participant in neuronal death, aberrant synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation, is upregulated in experimental epilepsy models. Increased MMP-9 is also implicated in clinical epilepsy studies. Thus, we hypothesize that MMP-9 may be a novel therapeutic target for epilepsy and some agents, such as S24994, atorvastatin and minocycline, may be potential antiepileptogenic drugs.", 
    "98": "Deficits in memory function have been observed in pentylentetrazole (PTZ)-kindled rats. In the present study we examined the effects of atorvastatin ((3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitor) on PTZ kindling and related memory deficits in rats trained with the passive avoidance test. Subconvulsive PTZ doses rendered a gradual increase in seizure activity. PTZ kindling caused long-term memory to deteriorate. Atorvastatin per se and in PTZ-kindled rats improved learning and memory functions. It also prolonged latency (time to appearance of spike potentials) and diminished the amplitude and frequency of spike potentials, which indicate epileptic discharges. These novel findings suggest that the favorable effect of the atorvastatin on memory deficits provoked by PTZ kindling might be of clinical utility.", 
    "99": "Rhabdomyolysis is a known complication of statin therapy and may be triggered by a pharmacokinetic interaction between a statin and a second medication. Fatal statin-induced rhabdomyolysis has an incidence of 0.15 deaths/million prescriptions. We describe 4 cases of severe rhabdomyolysis with the common feature of atorvastatin use and coadministration of fusidic acid. All cases involved long-term therapy with atorvastatin; fusidic acid was introduced for treatment of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. Three cases occurred in the setting of diabetes mellitus, with 2 in patients with end-stage renal disease, suggesting increased susceptibility to atorvastatin-fusidic acid-induced rhabdomyolysis in these patient populations. Of the 4 patients in this series, 3 died. Fusidic acid is a unique bacteriostatic antimicrobial agent with principal antistaphylococcal activity. There have been isolated reports of rhabdomyolysis attributed to the interaction of statins and fusidic acid, the cause of which is unclear. Fusidic acid does not inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme responsible for atorvastatin metabolism; increased atorvastatin levels due to inhibition of the glucuronidation pathway may be responsible. Considering the low frequency of fusidic acid use, the appearance of 4 such cases within a short time and in a small population suggests the probability that development of this potentially fatal complication may be relatively high.", 
    "100": "A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in KIF6, a member of the KIF9 family of kinesins, is associated with differential coronary event reduction from statin therapy in four randomized controlled trials; this SNP (rs20455) is also associated with the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) in multiple prospective studies. We investigated whether other common SNPs in the KIF6 region were associated with event reduction from statin therapy. Of the 170 SNPs in the KIF6 region investigated in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial (CARE), 28 were associated with differential event reduction from statin therapy (P (interaction) < 01 in Caucasians, adjusted for age and sex) and were further investigated in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI22) and West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS). These analyses revealed that two SNPs (rs9462535 and rs9471077), in addition to rs20455, were associated with event reduction from statin therapy (P (interaction) < 0.1 in each of the three studies). The relative risk reduction ranged from 37 to 50% (P < 0.01) in carriers of the minor alleles of these SNPs and from -4 to 13% (P > 0.4) in non-carriers. These three SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium with one another (r (2) > 0.84). Functional studies of these variants may help to understand the role of KIF6 in the pathogenesis of CHD and differential response to statin therapy.", 
    "101": "In 2007, the Japan Atherosclerosis Society published the Guidelines for prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, the guidelines have several flaws with regard to the cutoff level of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). First, LDL-C level is used instead of serum total cholesterol (TC) level in the guidelines. In this case, they must show at least some basic data on the relationship between LDL-C level and mortality or morbidity from coronary heart disease (CHD). Second, it was recommended that the LDL-C level be below 140 mg/dL or 3.6 mmol/L (corresponding to a TC level of 220 mg/dL or 5.7 mmol/L, respectively). These levels are unreasonable considering that the TC levels of 240-260 mg/dL are optimal in terms of all-cause mortality for the Japanese population. Third, although there are big differences in mortality and morbidity from CHD between sexes, they discussed the matter without considering these differences. Last but not least, the conflict of interest of the editors of the guidelines has never been disclosed. The Japanese population has a lower CHD mortality and incidence than populations from other industrialized countries despite an increase in serum TC level in the former. In populations with a markedly lower coronary mortality or morbidity such as the Japanese population, it is still important to determine the optimal cutoff level of LDL-C to prevent the development of CHD and other atherosclerotic diseases.",

Rats received SV (groups: S, S-IR) or saline solution (groups: C, C-IR) intragastrically (25 mg/kg) for 21 days. Before homogenization, rat livers (C-IR, S-IR) underwent ischemia (40 min) and reperfusion (60 min). Activities of such antioxidative enzymes as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) as well as lipid peroxides (LPO) level as indicator of oxidative stress were then estimated in the homogenates. All these parameters were measured spectrophotometrically. Additionally, alanine and asparagine aminotransferase (ALT, AST) levels were estimated in the blood before and after I/R. In groups C and S all examined parameters were similar regardless of SV-treatment. I/R produced significant increases in GPx and CAT activities only in the C-IR group. Conversely, GPx activity was significantly decreased and ALT and AST increased significantly in the S-IR group. SV did not evoke any noticeable protective changes in rat livers after 3 weeks of treatment. After I/R, some of the observed properties could suggest that SV may have even made liver function and the oxidative state worse.",

Senescence markers were evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from HIV-infected patients under PI treatment. PIs induced senescence markers, prelamin A accumulation, oxidative stress, and inflammation in HCAECs. Senescence markers and prelamin A were also observed in PBMCs from HIV-infected patients under ritonavir-boosted PIs. Pravastatin, FTI-277, and antioxidants improved PI adverse effects in HCAECs.

In contrast to these marked diurnal changes in cholesterol metabolism, serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels remained stable during the diurnal cycle. Depletion of liver cholesterol by treatment with the bile acid-binding resin, cholestyramine, abolished the diurnal rhythms of both PCSK9 and lathosterol.

Also, these cells were treated with manumycin A, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor which blocks the mevalonate-dependent isoprenylation of small guanosin triphosphate binding proteins. First, mesenchymal stromal cell morphology, cytoskeleton assembly, cell cycle, survival and cytokine production were evaluated. Then, these cells were co-cultured with either T or B lymphocytes and we analyzed: 1) the inhibition of T-cell proliferation to mitogenic stimuli; 2) B-cell survival.", 
    "115": "Fluvastatin altered the assembly of actin microfilaments, inactivated RhoA guanosin triphosphate binding protein, inhibited the S-phase of the cell cycle, induced apoptosis in a small fraction of cells but preserved cytokine production. Preincubation of mesenchymal stromal cells with fluvastatin, or manumycin A, down-regulated the expression of adhesion molecules, reduced cell-to-cell interactions and prevented the inhibition exerted by these stromal cells on CD3/T-cell receptor-induced lymphocyte proliferation. Mevalonic acid could revert morphological, phenotypic and functional effects of fluvastatin. Finally, fluvastatin significantly reduced the mesenchymal stromal cells-mediated rescue of B cells in the presence of dexamethasone, although it did not function in the absence of corticosteroids.", 
    "116": "Fluvastatin-mediated effects on bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells were conceivably due to the inhibition of isoprenylation of small guanosin triphosphate binding proteins, occurring for the lack of mevalonate. Altogether these findings suggest that drugs acting on the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway can regulate mesenchymal stromal cell-induced T-cell suppression and B-lymphocyte survival.",

The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of oxidative stress in the cytotoxicity of simvastatin in murine CT26 colon carcinoma cells and B16BL6 melanoma cells. We found that CT26 cells were more sensitive to simvastatin than B16BL16 cells. Interestingly, exposure to simvastatin causes significant apoptotic cell death and perturbations in parameters indicative of oxidative stress in CT26 cells. Moreover, the increase in oxidative stress parameters and cell death were suppressed by isoprenoids including mevalonolactone, farnesyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt, and coenzyme Q10, and by antioxidants including N-acetyl cysteine, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutases (SOD), and catalase (CAT) alone or in combination, but were promoted by an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, L-buthionine-sulfoximine. The signaling pathway induced by simvastatin breaks down the antioxidant defense system by suppressing the expression of reactive oxygen species scavengers, particularly Mn-SOD, CAT, GPx1, and SESN 3, thereby inducing oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death.

The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether lovastatin reverses \"dedifferentiation\" of human NP cells during monolayer expansion. Expression of genes encoding type II collagen and transcription factor SOX9 in these cells was upregulated by lovastatin, with maximal stimulations observed at 5 \u00b5M, whereas type I collagen gene expression was suppressed by the drug, with maximal inhibitions observed at 5-10 \u00b5M.

Atorvastatin also induced autophagy that is a physiologic process involved in the turnover of intracellular organelles. Atorvastatin-induced autophagy was found to be inhibited by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) small interfering RNA. Examination of HCC patients showed the positive correlation between AMPK activity and autophagic marker (beclin-1). Atorvastatin-induced AMPK activation could induce p21 expression, which was also positively correlated with beclin-1 expression in CRC patients. AMPK/p21 signaling caused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response leading to the induction of autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy by an autophagic inhibitor bafilomycin A1 or genetic knockout of autophagy-related gene 5 enhanced atorvastatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis. In summary, activation of AMPK by atorvastatin enhances p21 expression and ER stress response, leading to autophagy, which promotes survival of cancer cells.

The statin-dependent clearance of extracellular A\u03b2 is mainly exerted by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) that is secreted in a nonconventional pathway in association with exosomes. Stimulated IDE secretion and A\u03b2 degradation were also observed in blood of mice upon peripheral treatment with lovastatin. Importantly, increased IDE secretion upon lovastatin treatment was dependent on protein isoprenylation and up-regulation of exosome secretion by fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate a novel pathway for the nonconventional secretion of IDE via exosomes. The modulation of this pathway could provide a new strategy to enhance the extracellular clearance of A\u03b2.", 
    "172": "Many myocardial infarctions and strokes occur in individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below recommended treatment thresholds. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) testing has been advocated to identify low- and intermediate-risk individuals who may benefit from statin therapy.", 
    "173": "A decision analytic Markov model was used to follow hypothetical cohorts of individuals with normal lipid levels but without coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, or diabetes mellitus. The model compared current Adult Treatment Panel III practice guidelines, a strategy of hs-CRP screening in those without an indication for statin treatment by current practice guidelines followed by treatment only in those with elevated hs-CRP levels, and a strategy of statin therapy at specified predicted risk thresholds without hs-CRP testing. Risk-based treatment without hs-CRP testing was the most cost-effective strategy, assuming that statins were equally effective regardless of hs-CRP status. However, if normal hs-CRP levels identified a subgroup with little or no benefit from statin therapy (<20% relative risk reduction), then hs-CRP screening would be the optimal strategy. If harms from statin use were greater than generally recognized, then use of current clinical guidelines would be the optimal strategy.",

    "175": "Small-dense LDL (SD-LDL) has been particularly implicated in atherosclerosis. It has previously been reported that in non-diabetic people SD-LDL is preferentially glycated. The distribution of glycated apolipoprotein B (glyc-apoB) in lipoproteins in metabolic syndrome (MS) and in type 2 diabetes has not previously been studied. Plasma apoB and glyc-apoB were determined in different apoB-containing lipoproteins including buoyant and SD-LDL in MS (n=18) and type 2 diabetes (DM) [n=48; 12 statin-untreated (DM-S) and 36 statin-treated (DM+S)]. Plasma glyc-apoB was 5.6 \u00b1 0.9, 3.5 \u00b1 0.5 and 4.0 \u00b1 0.2 mg/dl in DM-S, DM+S and MS, respectively. The glycated proportion of SD-LDL-apoB was greater than buoyant LDL in all groups. SD-LDL contributed most to plasma glyc-apoB in DM-S, because SD-LDL-apoB was higher in DM-S than in MS and DM+S (p < 0.001). Plasma glyc-apoB correlated with SD-LDL-apoB (r=0.74, p < 0.0001 in diabetes and r=0.53, p < 0.001 in MS), but not with HbA(1c). SD-LDL is preferentially glycated in type 2 diabetes and MS. Its concentration is a stronger determinant of plasma glycapoB than glycaemia. Statin-induced changes in its level may be important in decreasing apoB glycation in diabetes. These findings may explain the small effect of improving glycaemia relative to statin treatment in reducing atherosclerosis risk in type 2 diabetes and the increased risk in MS even before the onset of type 2 diabetes.",

Sample preparations were optimized by exploring various extraction solvents, derivatization reagents, and hydrolysis methods to achieve reliable and maximum sensitivity for these two different compound classes. As a result, satisfactory accuracy, precision, and sensitivity were obtained in the validation. The method was then applied to quantify urinary oxysterols and bile acids produced from liver toxicity induced by atorvastatin (250 mg/kg/day). From the results, increases in bile acid levels and decreases in the concentration ratio between cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, which are the distinguishing phenomena observed in serum or bile for liver toxicity, were also observed in urine. Additionally, the mechanism of liver toxicity was investigated with the urinary concentration ratio of product to precursor in the metabolic pathway from cholesterol to bile acids. The results indicated that enzyme activities related to the production and degradation of bile acids, not oxysterols, were significantly changed from liver toxicity. Thus, it was concluded that urinary levels of oxysterols and bile acids could be useful tools for checking liver toxicity and investigating its mechanism.",

    "194": "CALCIFIC AROTIC STENOSIS AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS: Aortic stenosis is the most frequent valvular heart disease in western world and its incidence continues to rise. Aortic sclerosis is the first characteristic lesion of the cusps, which is today considered a process similar to atherosclerosis. The progression of the disease is an active process leading to forming of bone matrix and heavily calcified stiff cusps by inflammatory cells and osteopontin. Aortic stenosis is a chronic, progressive disease which can remain asymptomatic for a long time even in the presence of severe aortic stenosis. MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR AORTIC STENOSIS: The need for alternative to aortic valve surgery is highlighted by increasing longevity of the population and new therapeutic strategies to limit disease progression are needed to delay or potentially avoid, the need for valve surgery. Currently, there are no established disease modifying treatments in regard to the progression of aortic stenosis. The first results about influence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins on aortic sclerosis and stenosis progression are promising. Statins are likely to reduce cardiovascular events rather than disease progression, but may be potentially a valuable preventive treatment in these patients. The prejudice against the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors by patients with aortic stenosis is changing. The cautious use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by patients with concomitant hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure seems appropriate. Definite evidence from large clinical trials is awaited.",

Responsible for making and maintaining the extracellular matrix, the cells of IVDs are supplied with essential nutrients by diffusion from the blood supply through mainly the cartilaginous endplates and the periphery of the annulus. Many researches have demonstrated a strong association between atherosclerosis and IVD degeneration. The plaques in the artery can disturb the blood supply to IVDs. In addition, local injection of simvastatin was preliminarily found to promote autogenous chondrogenic disc repair and retard disc degeneration. Herein we postulate that orally administered statins may not only improve nutrition supply of IVDs through decreasing the influence of plaques on disturbance of blood supply, but also may promote disc repair, which may provide an alternative strategy for disc repair in a less expensive and easily applied method.", 
    "206": "The chronic inflammatory environment of tumors is a target for novel antitumor therapeutic strategies. Besides cholesterol lowering effects, statins have been studied for their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. These pleiotropic effects result mainly from the altered post-translational modification of GTP-binding proteins which regulate many intracellular pathways involved in cell growth and survival. Although pre-clinical studies suggest that statins may be effective anticancer agents required doses that are 100 to 500 fold higher than those needed to lower cholesterol levels. Furthermore, in view of their wide-ranging effects on cellular metabolism, target site-specific delivery is preferred. In this study, we investigated tumor-specific delivery of pravastatin using small long-circulating liposomes. In vitro studies on the effects of (liposomal) pravastatin on viability and proliferation of tumor cells, endothelial cells and macrophages revealed that the latter were the most sensitive cell type towards (liposomal) pravastatin treatment. In vivo, liposome-encapsulated pravastatin (5mg/kg) inhibited murine B16F10-melanoma growth over 70% as compared to free pravastatin, which was ineffective. As expected, treatments did not influence serum cholesterol levels within the time frame of the study. At 48 h post-injection, 3 \u03bcg of pravastatin could still be recovered from the tumors of liposomal pravastatin treated mice, whereas pravastatin could not be detected in tumors of the free drug treated mice (i.e. < 20 ng). In contrast to the free drug, liposomal pravastatin treatment effectively inhibited the production of several pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic mediators involved in inflammation and angiogenesis, out of a range of a panel of 24 proteins studied. Furthermore, liposomal pravastatin treatment increased MHC class I protein expression in the tumor tissue whereas free drug showed no effect. Taken together, targeted delivery of statins can improve their tumor growth inhibiting activity by increasing local drug concentration and direct modulation of macrophage function. The antitumor activity seems to result primarily from a local inhibition of tumor inflammation and stimulation of antitumor immune response.",
