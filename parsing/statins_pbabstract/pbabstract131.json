    "0": "Cholesterol is an essential molecule for eukaryotic life and is an important precursor for a wide range of physiological processes. Biosynthesis and homoeostasis of cholesterol are complex mechanisms that are tightly regulated and interlinked with activities of a number of cytochrome P450 enzymes. These P450s play central critical roles in cholesterol metabolism. Key roles include a rate-limiting reaction in the synthesis of cholesterol itself, and in the oxidative transformations of cholesterol into steroid hormones and bile acids. However, microbial P450s also have important roles that impinge directly on human cholesterol synthesis and oxidation. Recent data reveal that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (which infects more than one-third of the world's human population) uses P450s to initiate breakdown of host cholesterol as an energy source. Microbial P450s also catalyse industrially important transformations in the synthesis of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, with clear benefits to humans. The present article reviews the various roles of P450s in human cholesterol metabolism, from endogenous P450s through to microbial oxidases that enable catabolism of human cholesterol, or facilitate production of statins that regulate cholesterol production with positive outcomes in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "1": "Single non-ionic surfactant based self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) was formulated and characterised for poor water soluble drug, Atorvastatin calcium. Capmul MCM oil showing highest solubility for Atorvastatin calcium was selected as oil phase. Self-nanoemulsifying capacity of Cremophor RH 40, Cremophor EL, Tween 20, Tween 60, Tween 80 and Labrasol were tested for the selected oil. In vitro dissolution studies were performed and were characterized by t85% and dissolution efficiency (DE). Cytotoxicity of the formulations and permeation enhancement of the drug across caco-2 cell monolayer was assessed. Capmul MCM was found to be better nanoemulsified in decreasing order of Cremophor RH 40 > Cremophor EL > Tween 20 > Tween 60 > Tween 80. Values of droplet size (range 11-83 nm), polydispersity index (range 0.07-0.65); zeta potential (range -3.97 to -19.0) and cloud point (60-85\u00b0C) before and after drug loading proves the uniformity and stability of the formulations. SNEDDS formulated with Tween 20 surfactant showed enhanced dissolution with t85% and DE values at 10 min and 78.70, respectively. None of the formulation showed cytotoxicity at the concentration tested. Tween 20 based SNEDDS enhanced permeation of the drug as compared with pure drug across cell lines. It can be concluded that SNEDDS can be formulated by using single non-ionic surfactant system for enhance dissolution and absorption of poorly soluble drug, Atorvastatin calcium.", 
    "2": "For patients with cardiovascular disease, statins belong to routine medical treatment irrespective of blood lipid levels. In primary prevention also, statins have been found to prevent cardiovascular diseases, associated deaths and decrease overall mortality. In previously healthy persons the use of statins should be based on the assessment of total risk--mere cholesterol level does not usually constitute an indication for treatment. The use of statins may lead to adverse effects, the major one being myopathy, for which an elevated risk is associated with increasing statin dosages.",

Oxidative stress, as assessed by serum Nox2 and urinary isoprostanes, and platelet activation, as assessed by platelet recruitment, platelet isoprostanes, and thromboxane A(2), platelet Nox2, Rac1, p47(phox), protein kinase C, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, nitric oxide, and phospholipase A(2), were determined at baseline and after 2, 24, and 72 hours and 7 days of follow-up. An in vitro study was also performed to see whether atorvastatin affects platelet oxidative stress and activation. The atorvastatin-assigned group showed a significant and progressive reduction of urinary isoprostanes and serum Nox2, along with inhibition of platelet recruitment, platelet isoprostanes, Nox2, Rac1, p47(phox), and protein kinase C, starting 2 hours after administration. Platelet phospholipase A(2) and thromboxane A(2) significantly decreased and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and nitric oxide increased after 24 hours. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly after 72 hours and further declined after 7 days. No changes were observed in the Mediterranean diet group. In vitro experiments demonstrated that atorvastatin dose-dependently inhibited platelet Nox2 and phospholipase A(2) activation, along with inhibition of platelet recruitment, platelet isoprostanes, and thromboxane A(2), and increased vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and nitric oxide.",

    "7": "Atorvastatin (ATV), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, is widely prescribed as a lipid-lowering drug. It also inhibits the RhoA-Rho-associated kinase pathway in vascular smooth muscle (SM) cells and critically inhibits SM function. Myocardin is a coactivator of serum response factor, which upregulates SM contractile proteins. The RhoA-Rho-associated kinase pathway, which directly triggers SM contraction, also increases myocardin gene expression. Therefore, we investigated whether ATV inhibits myocardin gene expression in SM cells. In mice injected with ATV (IP 20 \u03bcg/g per day) for 5 days, myocardin gene expression was significantly downregulated in aortic and carotid arterial tissues with decreased expression of myocardin target genes SM \u03b1-actin and SM22. Correspondingly, the contractility of aortic rings in mice treated with ATV or the Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632 was reduced in response to treatment with either KCl or phenylephrine. In cultured mouse and human aortic SM cells, KCl treatment stimulated the expression of myocardin, SM \u03b1-actin, and SM22. These stimulatory effects were prevented by ATV treatment. ATV-induced inhibition of myocardin expression was prevented by pretreatment with either mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate but not farnesylpyrophosphate. Treatment with Y-27632 mimicked ATV effects on the gene expression of myocardin, SM \u03b1-actin, and SM22, further suggesting a role for the RhoA-Rho-associated kinase pathway in ATV effects. Furthermore, ATV treatment inhibited RhoA membrane translocation and activation; these effects were prevented by pretreatment with mevalonate. We conclude that ATV inhibits myocardin gene expression in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a novel mechanism for ATV inhibition of vascular contraction.",

We investigated the effects of ox-LDL on KLF expression. Furthermore, since atorvastatin is commonly used to treat high cholesterol, we also examined the role of this drug in the regulation of KLF expression. The human umbilical vein endothelial cell line EA.hy926 was treated with atorvastatin and ox-LDL alone or in combination, and KLF expression was examined by DNA microarray, semi-quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and immuno\ufb02uorescence analyses. Atorvastatin upregulated KLF expression in EA.hy926 cells in both the quiescent and ox-LDL-induced inflammatory states, suggesting that KLFs were novel participants in the vascular endothelial dysfunction response to ox-LDL. Our study demonstrated that atorvastatin increased both the mRNA and protein levels of KLF in quiescent EA.hy926 cells. Moreover, atorvastatin counteracted the ox-LDL-induced downregulation of KLF expression.",

The risk reduction for patients on dialysis appears to be less than in pre-dialysis CKD. These findings may be due to the higher rate of non-atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease found in end-stage disease. Because of this, the role of LLT is less clear in CKD than in the general population. This review outlines the results of recent trials of LLT, particularly Ezetimibe, and implications for patients with CKD. The evidence in favour of lipid lowering in CKD comes largely from the SHARP study. This study used combined simvastatin and Ezetimibe to reduce cholesterol. Though the benefits of statins are well proven, there is no evidence that Ezetimibe independently reduces cardiovascular events in any population. Data which support the use of Ezetimibe show only that it effectively reduces cholesterol. Surrogate end-point data are contentious. Some studies suggest benefit whilst others suggest off-target effects that question the validity of Ezetimibe in the absence of quality cardiovascular outcome data.",

It may be caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, apolipoprotein B100 (Apo B100), or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) genes, with over 1,000 causative mutations described. Statin therapy in HeFH is considered effective and safe. Audit data suggest that approximately 80% of the putative HeFH population remains unidentified and, therefore, there is a need to develop a strategy for the identification of affected individuals so that early lipid-lowering treatment may be offered. There is good evidence showing the effectiveness and acceptability of HeFH screening programs in Europe. The authors describe a protocol for an all island approach to HeFH detection in the Republic of Ireland/Northern Ireland. Index cases will be identified by opportunistic screening using the Simon Broome, or Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death (MedPed) and World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Patients identified as \"definite,\" \"probable,\" or \"possible\" HeFH criteria will be offered genetic testing. The authors expect causative mutations to be identified in approximately 80% of patients with \"definite\" HeFH but in only approximately 20% of patients with \"possible\" HeFH. Cascade screening will be undertaken in first-degree relatives of the index case using genetic testing (where a causative mutation has been identified), or otherwise using LDL cholesterol concentration. The establishment of a HeFH screening program on an all-island basis will require: expansion of the existing molecular genetics diagnostic services, the establishment of a cohort of nurses/genetic counselors, a HeFH database to support cascade testing, the development of a network of lipid clinics (in a primary or secondary care setting), and an educational initiative to raise awareness of HeFH among healthcare professionals and the general population.",

We explored whether low doses of atorvastatin, losartan, and particularly their combination, possess important pleiotropic vasodilatory effects. Wistar rats were treated daily with low-dose atorvastatin (2 mg/kg, n = 15), low-dose losartan (5 mg/kg, n = 15), their combination (n = 15), or saline (n = 15). After 4, 6, or 8 weeks the animals were anesthetized, blood samples taken, and their hearts and thoracic aortas isolated. Two kinds of experiments were performed: the measurement of coronary flow rate after ischemia/reperfusion myocardial injury and endothelium-dependent relaxation of thoracic aorta. In both models, maximal vasodilation activity was obtained in rats treated for 6 weeks. In the ischemia/reperfusion myocardial injury model, coronary flow increased (atorvastatin or losartan 1.9-fold, P < 0.01; combination 2.4-fold, P < 0.001) compared with controls. In the thoracic aorta model, endothelium-dependent relaxation significantly increased only in the combination group compared with the control group (up to 1.4-fold; P < 0.01). Simultaneously, we detected increased anti-inflammatory activity and increased nitric oxide concentration, but no changes in lipids and blood pressure. In a rat model we showed important vasodilatory activity of low-dose atorvastatin, losartan, and particularly their combination. The effects of the low-dose combination were accompanied by, and probably at least partly achieved by, anti-inflammatory and nitric oxide pathways. Overall, these results could be valuable for the development of new vascular protective strategies focusing on a low-dose regimen of statins and sartans, and particularly their combination.", 
    "32": "Clinical trials have reported reduced cardiovascular events with certain antihypertensive agents at a rate that could not be predicted by changes in brachial arterial pressure alone. These findings may be explained, in part, by pleiotropic effects of these agents and modulation of central blood pressures. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which calcium channel blockers exert pleiotropic effects, both alone and in combination with statins and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. The essential role of nitric oxide (NO) in maintaining endothelial function and the relationship between NO and reactive oxygen species are discussed in the context of the etiology of hypertension. The importance of managing global cardiovascular risk is emphasized, as hypertension commonly clusters with dyslipidemia and loss of glucose control. From a mechanistic viewpoint, these risk factors contribute to endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation in a synergistic fashion. A greater understanding of the mechanisms of actions of these cardiovascular agents may lead to more effective drug combinations, to the benefit of individual patients. Furthermore, by elucidating the biological mechanisms by which cardiovascular risk factors lead to vascular injury, we may highlight common pathways and identify novel therapeutic targets.",

Moreover, numerous clinical trials have evaluated the use of nutritional supplements in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and in achievement of optimal blood pressure control. Additionally, the advent of interventional techniques, such as carotid baroreceptor stimulation and renal ablation of sympathetic nerve activity, seems to be proved effective in cases where medical management and lifestyle modifications are insufficient. Genetic technology, which has advanced tremendously over the past few years, could assist novel treatment options in hypertensive patients, such as RNA interference targeting hypertension-related genes.

    "52": "Reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin reduced the risk of major vascular events (RR 0\u00b779, 95% CI 0\u00b777-0\u00b781, per 1\u00b70 mmol/L reduction), largely irrespective of age, sex, baseline LDL cholesterol or previous vascular disease, and of vascular and all-cause mortality. The proportional reduction in major vascular events was at least as big in the two lowest risk categories as in the higher risk categories (RR per 1\u00b70 mmol/L reduction from lowest to highest risk: 0\u00b762 [99% CI 0\u00b747-0\u00b781], 0\u00b769 [99% CI 0\u00b760-0\u00b779], 0\u00b779 [99% CI 0\u00b774-0\u00b785], 0\u00b781 [99% CI 0\u00b777-0\u00b786], and 0\u00b779 [99% CI 0\u00b774-0\u00b784]; trend p=0\u00b704), which reflected significant reductions in these two lowest risk categories in major coronary events (RR 0\u00b757, 99% CI 0\u00b736-0\u00b789, p=0\u00b70012, and 0\u00b761, 99% CI 0\u00b750-0\u00b774, p<0\u00b70001) and in coronary revascularisations (RR 0\u00b752, 99% CI 0\u00b735-0\u00b775, and 0\u00b763, 99% CI 0\u00b751-0\u00b779; both p<0\u00b70001). For stroke, the reduction in risk in participants with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10% (RR per 1\u00b70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0\u00b776, 99% CI 0\u00b761-0\u00b795, p=0\u00b70012) was also similar to that seen in higher risk categories (trend p=0\u00b73). In participants without a history of vascular disease, statins reduced the risks of vascular (RR per 1\u00b70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 0\u00b785, 95% CI 0\u00b777-0\u00b795) and all-cause mortality (RR 0\u00b791, 95% CI 0\u00b785-0\u00b797), and the proportional reductions were similar by baseline risk. There was no evidence that reduction of LDL cholesterol with a statin increased cancer incidence (RR per 1\u00b70 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction 1\u00b700, 95% CI 0\u00b796-1\u00b704), cancer mortality (RR 0\u00b799, 95% CI 0\u00b793-1\u00b706), or other non-vascular mortality.", 
    "53": "In individuals with 5-year risk of major vascular events lower than 10%, each 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol produced an absolute reduction in major vascular events of about 11 per 1000 over 5 years. This benefit greatly exceeds any known hazards of statin therapy. Under present guidelines, such individuals would not typically be regarded as suitable for LDL-lowering statin therapy. The present report suggests, therefore, that these guidelines might need to be reconsidered.",

Gallstones can be one of two types - cholesterol or pigment - with cholesterol gallstones representing nearly the 80% of the total. Cholesterol and pigment gallstones have different predisposing factors: cholesterol gallstones are related to supersaturated bile in cholesterol, whereas black pigment gallstones are related to hyperbilirubinbilia factors (hemolysis, etc.); these are necessary, but not sufficient, factors to produce gallstones in vivo. Gall bladder mucosa factors (gall bladder secretion of mucin, local bile stasis and production of endogenous biliary \u03b2-glucuronidase) may coexist with the aforementioned factors and facilitate gallstone nucleation and growth. The gold-standard treatment for symptomatic gallstones is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Several studies have reported a significant reduction in the onset of symptomatic gallstones disease in patients undergoing chronic therapy with statins, which can reduce bile cholesterol saturation. Aspirin, which has been shown to reduce the local production of gall bladder mucins (mucosal or parietal factors of gallstone formation) in animal experimental models, does not appear to reduce the risk of symptomatic gallstones disease when tested alone. The new horizon of oral therapy for the prevention of symptomatic gallstone disease needs to evaluate the long-term effect of statins and chronic aspirin administration in patients with dyslipidemia and/or atherosclerosis.",

It is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Immunobullous disease is usually idiopathic but can be drug-induced. Both idiopathic and iatrogenic forms share common clinical and immunohistological features. The authors report a case of pemphigoid induced by rosuvastatin, a commonly prescribed medication. To our knowledge, there is limited report on rosuvastatin associated with pemphigoid in the literature.",

She presented with familial combined hyperlipidaemia with family history of premature coronary artery disease. After 4-week therapy of 5 mg of rosuvastatin once a week combined with 10 mg of ezetimibe daily, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was markedly decreased from 3.88 to 2.82 mmol/l (27.3% reduction). She has experienced no adverse effects after 6 month treatment. The results suggest that the combination therapy of low-dose once-weekly rosuvastatin and daily ezetimibe could be used as an effective regimen for patients with mitochondrial disease.",

Laboratory tests indicated hyperlipidemia and elevated liver enzyme levels >4 times the upper normal limit (UNL). Day 40 post-MI, the patient returned to the hospital complaining of daily chest discomfort, atypical for angina pectoris. Following an unremarkable stress test result, the patient was encouraged to proceed with CR. Patient made regular progress through CR, although continued to experience paroxysmal chest discomfort away from CR, which he denied having during exercise. On day 75, his lipid profile met recommended targets while taking atorvastatin, but with liver enzymes >38 times UNL. Atorvastatin was discontinued at day 85, to which his enzymes responded appropriately, but by day 165, hyperlipidemia had returned. Rosuvastatin was started but was discontinued (day 197), with liver enzymes 6 times UNL. He continued CR without lipid therapy but at CR completion, the lipid panel did not meet targets. However, fitness and social indices improved significantly, although he occasionally still experienced chest pain, but with lesser frequency and intensity, and never with exercise.",

    "62": "Recent evidence suggests that insulin resistance in diabetes induces postprandial dyslipidemia by increasing the enterocytic production of chylomicrons and their remnant particles, but an impaired clearance capacity is also involved. Postprandial dyslipidaemia in diabetes induces oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction and this may be compounded by dysglycaemia. New guidelines for managing hypertriglyceridaemia in diabetes have been published, first-line therapies being improved glycaemic control, treatment of other secondary causes of dyslipidaemia and statin therapy, followed by judicious use of fibrates, n-3 fatty acids or niacin. A new role for incretin-based therapies in regulating dyslipidaemia has been identified.", 
    "63": "Postprandial dyslipidaemia is a pivotal mechanism whereby diabetes can induce and accelerate atherosclerosis. Regulating the plasma concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may decrease the cardiovascular complications of diabetes. The mechanisms of action of incretin-based treatments on dyslipidaemia and endothelial dysfunction need further investigation. The efficacy of new therapies targeted at postprandial dysmetabolism in diabetes need to be confirmed, against best current levels of care, in clinical endpoint trials.",

However, the narrow therapeutic time window and the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage after tPA treatment pose major hurdles to its clinical usage. In light of the failures of neuroprotective therapies in clinical trials, emerging concepts suggest that neuroprotection alone without restoration of tissue perfusion and vascular integrity may not be adequate for treatment of acute stroke. Here we review evidence of the use of adjuvant pharmacological agents to extend the therapeutic window for tPA via targeting the neurovascular unit and the underlying mechanisms of the combination therapy in experimental stroke.",

LDL III concentration fell from 178.8 mg/dl (61.6 - 231.0) to 96.1 mg/dl (49.3 - 204.5), p = 0.05. In patients treatment altered the LDL profile so that LDLIII which was the major subfraction present at baseline was reduced from 49.9% to 29.8% (p = 0.01). Remnant lipoproteins (RLP) also fell with a mean reduction of 3.5 mg/dl in RLP-Cholesterol (95%CI 0.1 - 6.9, p = 0.05) and 12.4 mg/dl in RLP-triglyceride (95%CI 2.6 - 22.2, p = 0.03).

A tendency to an increase in LDL-C was observed but this was offset by an alteration in the distribution of the LDL profile towards lighter, larger LDL particles. We propose that treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in conjunction with a statin may be the ideal therapy in these patients.",

An autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine promoted whereas rapamycin (an autophagy enhancer) diminished H2O2-induced PARP cleavage. Simvastatin enhanced H2O2-induced LC3-II formation and simultaneously decreased PARP fragmentation. Radiography and immunohistopathology demonstrated that simvastatin reduced the number of apoptotic osteoblasts and the extension of periapical lesions in rats. The number of Beclin-1-synthesizing osteoblasts also increased markedly after simvastatin treatment.",

However, there is large variability in clinical response to statin treatment. Recent research provides evidence that genetic variation contributes to this variable response to statin treatment. Until recently, pharmacogenetic studies have used mainly candidate gene approaches to investigate these effects. Since candidate gene studies explain only a small part of the observed variation and results have often been inconsistent, genome-wide association (GWA) studies may be a better approach. In this paper the most important candidate gene studies and the first published GWA studies assessing statin response are discussed. Moreover, we describe the PHASE study, an EU-funded GWA study that will investigate the genetic variation responsible for the variation in response to pravastatin in a large randomized clinical trial.",

Typically, 2 to 6 weeks after a vascular procedure renal failure and characteristic cutaneous signs develop. Livedo reticularis and blue toes, although classic symptoms, are not pathognomonic and may be even absent. Vasculitis is an important differential diagnosis. Diagnosis can only be proven by skin, muscle or kidney biopsy. Alternatively, fundoscopy can show retinal cholesterol emboli. Therapy is mostly limited to symptomatic measures. Corticosteroids have no proven efficacy and may be harmful. Statins should be given to all patients due to their plaque stabilizing and anti-inflammatory properties.

However, despite multiple validation studies of CAC, and C-IMT, these modalities do not accurately assess plaque characteristics, and the composition and inflammatory state of the plaque determine its stability and, therefore, the risk of clinical events. [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging using positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) has been extensively studied in oncologic metabolism. Studies using animal models and immunohistochemistry in humans show that FDG-PET/CT is exquisitely sensitive for detecting macrophage activity, an important source of cellular inflammation in vessel walls. More recently, we and others have shown that FDG-PET/CT enables highly precise, novel measurements of inflammatory activity of activity of atherosclerotic plaques in large and medium-sized arteries. FDG-PET/CT studies have many advantages over other imaging modalities: 1) high contrast resolution; 2) quantification of plaque volume and metabolic activity allowing for multi-modal atherosclerotic plaque quantification; 3) dynamic, real-time, in vivo imaging; 4) minimal operator dependence. Finally, vascular inflammation detected by FDG-PET/CT has been shown to predict cardiovascular (CV) events independent of traditional risk factors and is also highly associated with overall burden of atherosclerosis. Plaque activity by FDG-PET/CT is modulated by known beneficial CV interventions such as short term (12 week) statin therapy as well as longer term therapeutic lifestyle changes (16 months). The current methodology for quantification of FDG uptake in atherosclerotic plaque involves measurement of the standardized uptake value (SUV) of an artery of interest and of the venous blood pool in order to calculate a target to background ratio (TBR), which is calculated by dividing the arterial SUV by the venous blood pool SUV. This method has shown to represent a stable, reproducible phenotype over time, has a high sensitivity for detection of vascular inflammation, and also has high inter-and intra-reader reliability. Here we present our methodology for patient preparation, image acquisition, and quantification of atherosclerotic plaque activity and vascular inflammation using SUV, TBR, and a global parameter called the metabolic volumetric product (MVP). These approaches may be applied to assess vascular inflammation in various study samples of interest in a consistent fashion as we have shown in several prior publications.",

Statin therapy has proven its efficacy in reducing CVD events in T2DM patients. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitors (gliptins), which are increasingly used to target hyperglycemia, also offer promising preliminary results regarding a possible reduction in CVD events. As most patients with T2DM may be treated with both a statin and a gliptin, dual pharmacological therapy, possibly as a fixed-dose combination (FDC), deserves further consideration.",

    "113": "Recent studies suggest that the reported protective effects of statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) against community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis in humans may be due to confounders and a healthy user-effect. To directly test whether statins are protective against Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of CAP, we examined the impact of prolonged oral simvastatin therapy at physiologically relevant doses in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia. BALB/c mice were placed on rodent chow containing 0 mg/kg (control), 12 mg/kg (low simvastatin diet [LSD]; corresponds to 1.0 mg/kg/day), or 120 mg/kg (high simvastatin diet [HSD]; corresponds to 10 mg/kg/day) simvastatin for four weeks, infected intratracheally with S. pneumoniae serotype 4 strain TIGR4, and sacrificed at 24, 36, or 42 h post-infection for assessment of lung histology, cytokine production, vascular leakage and edema, bacterial burden and bloodstream dissemination. Some mice received ampicillin at 12-h intervals beginning at 48 h post-infection and were monitored for survival. Immunoblots of homogenized lung samples was used to assess ICAM-1 production.",

HSD mice also had significantly lower bacterial titers in the blood at 36 (P = 0.007) and 42 (P = 0.03) hours post-infection versus controls. LSD had a more modest effect against S. pneumoniae but also resulted in reduced bacterial titers in the lungs and blood of mice after 42 h and a reduced number of infiltrated neutrophils. Neither LSD nor HSD mice had reduced mortality in a pneumonia model where mice received ampicillin 48 h after challenge.", 
    "115": "Prolonged oral simvastatin therapy had a strong dose-dependent effect on protection against S. pneumoniae as evidenced by reduced neutrophil infiltration, maintenance of vascular integrity, and lowered chemokine production in the lungs of mice on HSD. Statin therapy also protected through reduced bacterial burden in the lungs. Despite these protective correlates, mortality in the simvastatin-receiving cohorts was equivalent to controls. Thus, oral simvastatin at physiologically relevant doses only modestly protects against pneumococcal pneumonia.",

The effects of Blastocystis infections on human epithelial permeability are not known, and molecular mechanisms of Blastocystis-induced intestinal pathology remain unclear. This study was conducted to determine whether Blastocystis species alters human intestinal epithelial permeability, to assess whether these abnormalities are rho kinase (ROCK)-dependent, and to investigate the therapeutic potential of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Simvastatin in altered intestinal epithelial barrier function. The effect of metronidazole resistant (Mz(r)) Blastocystis isolated from a symptomatic patient on human colonic epithelial monolayers (Caco-2) was assessed. Modulation of enterocyte myosin light chain phosphorylation, transepithelial fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran fluxes, transepithelial resistance, cytoskeletal F-actin and tight junctional zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by parasite cysteine proteases were measured in the presence or absence of HMG-CoA reductase and ROCK inhibition. Blastocystis significantly decreased transepithelial resistance, increased epithelial permeability, phosphorylated myosin light chain and reorganized epithelial actin cytoskeleton and ZO-1. These alterations were abolished by inhibition of enterocyte ROCK, HMG-CoA reductase and parasite cysteine protease. Our findings suggest that cysteine proteases of Mz(r) Blastocystis induce ROCK-dependent disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier function and correlates with reorganization of cytoskeletal F-actin and tight junctional ZO-1. Simvastatin prevented parasite-induced barrier-compromise, suggesting a therapeutic potential of statins in intestinal infections.",

Although an adequate inflammatory response is necessary for the clearance of microorganisms, excessive inflammation can lead to ongoing local and systemic damage. Because of this extended inflammatory response despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, as well as increasing antibiotic resistance, adjuvant therapy for pneumonia that can favourably modify the immune response has become an increasingly relevant approach to improve prognosis. Different adjuvant treatment options for pneumonia have recently been proposed. Promising treatment options include corticosteroids, statins, macrolides and Toll-like receptor antagonists. The aim of this review is to summarize the inflammatory response during pneumonia and discuss the current knowledge and future perspectives regarding the anti-inflammatory treatment options for patients with pneumonia.",

Atorvastatin was stopped in both cases, and symptoms resolved. On the basis of family relationship between the two patients, it was possible to hypothesize a genetic basis for the myopathy. Genotyping showed the patients to be carriers of the rs4363657 polymorphism of SLCO1B1 gene.",

Statins, HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors are widely used in the primary and secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke. It has been proved that beyond their main effect on inhibition of endogenous cholesterol, they also modify the inflammatory process. Additional benefits from the use of statins result from their effect on the immune system. Increased risk of recurrent vascular episodes and risk of death after statin withdrawal in patients with vascular disorders is connected with termination of the anti-inflammatory effect of these drugs. The authors highlight that because of the anti-inflammatory effect of statins it is reasonable to use them in all patients at risk of ischaemic stroke, including those with atrial fibrillation.",

This study investigated the influence of atorvastatin treatment on circulating SAA-LDL levels among asymptomatic hypercholesterolemic patients. A total of 26 patients (mean age 63 years) received 10 mg/daily atorvastatin during a 12-week treatment period. The levels of LDL cholesterol and SAA-LDL, but not high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and SAA, were significantly reduced after the treatment. Stepwise adjusted regression analyses revealed that changes of SAA-LDL were significantly and positively correlated with those of SAA, while absolute changes were small, which warrants further investigation. The results suggest that atorvastatin may beneficially reduce SAA-LDL, and SAA-LDL may be a sensitive measure for monitoring the efficacy and antioxidant functions of atorvastatin.",

The optimum concentrations of ganghwayakssuk and glucose determined from the response surface methodology (RSM) design were 2.2% and 3.8%, respectively. By applying these conditions, the monacolin K productivity was increased to 3,007 mg/kg after 15 days of fermentation. On the other hand, other characteristics such as the total content of flavonoids and phenolic compounds, and the antioxidant activity were relatively unchanged. Therefore, Monascusfermented ganghwayakssuk is an excellent biomaterial for the development of functional foods because of its high level of monacolin K, known to lower cholesterol levels.",

In addition, osteoprotegerin (OPG) is known as an osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor. In this study, we investigated whether bisphosphonates and statins increase OPG expression and inhibit the expression of CD9, M-CSF, and RANKL in the bone marrow-derived stromal cell line ST2. We found that bisphosphonates and statins enhanced OPG mRNA expression and inhibited the expression of CD9, M-CSF, and RANKL mRNA. Futhermore, bisphosphonates and statins decreased the membrane localization of Ras and phosphorylated ERK1/2, and activated the p38MAPK. This indicates that bisphosphonates and statins enhanced OPG expression, and inhibited the expression of CD9, M-CSF, and RANKL through blocking the Ras/ERK pathway and activating p38MAPK. Accordingly, we believe that its clinical applications will be investigated in the future for the development of osteoporosis therapy.", 
    "139": "Net reclassification has become widely accepted as a method to demonstrate whether new diagnostic technologies add significantly to the discrimination of risk. However, more accurate categorization of risk does not necessarily result in a better clinical outcome. This study examined whether coronary artery calcium, a technology that improves net reclassification in patients at intermediate risk for cardiovascular events, is superior to a strategy that calls for broader intervention with statin therapy in these patients. To do so, the clinical impact and costs of 2 intervention regimens on outcome in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were calculated based on the known efficacy of statins. Intervention 1 involved treatment of all subjects at conventional intermediate risk with moderate-dose stain, whereas intervention 2 involved moderate- and high-dose statin therapy, respectively, of those remaining at intermediate risk and those reassigned to high risk after reclassification by coronary artery calcium. The 2 strategies would decrease clinical events by 23% and would produce net savings. However, these would be greater with the broad statin prevention strategy than with the coronary calcium reclassification strategy ($732,152 vs $288,336, respectively). In conclusion, even in the short term, the broad statin prevention strategy would be at least as effective in decreasing clinical events but with greater net savings than a prevention strategy using coronary calcium screening.",

Dyslipidemia is a common finding after renal transplantation and a significant risk factor in the development of coronary heart disease. Although a causal relationship with cardiovascular mortality has not been proven in the transplant population, it is reasonable to extrapolate data from the general population and aggressively treat posttransplant dyslipidemia. Statins are considered the agents of choice, though their use may be complicated by drug misadventures. Pravastatin, fluvastatin and pitavastatin are considered to be the safest statins to use in this population; however, given their low-potency, a high-potency statin, such as atorvastatin, may be necessary in patients with significant dyslipidemia. In this article, we discuss the etiology of and treatment strategies for dyslipidemia in renal transplant recipients based on a literature review of potential therapeutic adverse effects and benefits in this population.

Previous studies revealed that, by modulating membrane cholesterol content, statins could induce conformational changes in cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) tetraspanin. The aim of the presented study was to investigate the influence of statins on glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-mediated glucose uptake in tumor cells. We observed a significant concentration- and time-dependent decrease in glucose analogs' uptake in several tumor cell lines incubated with statins. This effect was reversible with restitution of cholesterol synthesis pathway with mevalonic acid as well as with supplementation of plasma membrane with exogenous cholesterol. Statins did not change overall GLUT1 expression at neither transcriptional nor protein levels. An exploratory clinical trial revealed that statin treatment decreased glucose uptake in peripheral blood leukocytes and lowered (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake by tumor masses in a mantle cell lymphoma patient. A bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the structure of human GLUT1 and to identify putative cholesterol-binding motifs in its juxtamembrane fragment. Altogether, the influence of statins on glucose uptake seems to be of clinical significance.

These results indicate that low-dose pravastatin provides a substantial beneficial effect for the prevention of CVD in Japanese patients with MetSyn without known CVD, a population at proportionally high risk in primary prevention.",

We will also introduce a new approach, the population percentile strategy, which is based on the fact that the amount of cholesterol in LDL can differ substantially. When cholesterol-depleted LDL particles are present, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) underestimates apolipoprotein B (apoB) and LDL particle number. Statins lower LDL-C and nonhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) more than they lower apoB and LDL particle number. This means that, even if LDL-C, non-HDL-C and apoB are equal markers of on-treatment risk, apoB is a better marker of the adequacy of LDL-lowering therapy.",

Gymnopilin was purified from the fruiting body of G. junonius and was reported to act on the spinal cord and depolarize motoneurons. This is the only evidence that gymnopilin has a biological effect on animals and no mechanism of the action has been determined at all. In this study, we examined effects of gymnopilin on intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+)](i)) of cultured cells isolated from the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of the rat. The cell culture consisted of neurons and non-neuronal cells. Gymnopilin increased [Ca(2+)](i) in both the types of cells. The gymnopilinevoked [Ca(2+)](i) rise in the non-neuronal cells was inhibited by cyclopiazonic acid and U-73122, inhibitors of Ca(2+)-ATPase of the intracellular Ca(2+) store and phospholipase C, respectively, but not by removal of extracellular Ca(2+). These results indicate that gymnopilin activated phospholipase C and mobilize Ca(2+) from the intracellular Ca(2+) store in non-neuronal cells from the DRG. This is the first report to show that gymnopilin directly acts on cells isolated from the mammalian nervous system.",

Statins are the principal therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases and are known to down-regulate LOX-1 expression. Whether the effect on the LOX-1 receptor is related to statin-mediated cholesterol-lowering activity is unknown. We investigate the requirement of cholesterol for LOX-1-mediated lipid particle internalization, trafficking, and processing and the role of statins as inhibitors of LOX-1 function. Disruption of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains by acute exposure of cells to methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin or chronic exposure to different statins (lovastatin and atorvastatin) led to a spatial disorganization of LOX-1 in plasma membranes and a marked loss of specific LOX-1 function in terms of ox-LDL binding and internalization. Subcellular fractionation and immunochemical studies indicate that LOX-1 is naturally present in caveolae-enriched lipid rafts and, by cholesterol reduction, the amount of LOX-1 in this fraction is highly decreased (\u226560%). In contrast, isoprenylation inhibition had no effect on the distribution and function of LOX-1 receptors. Furthermore, in primary cultures from atherosclerotic human aorta lesions, we confirm the presence of LOX-1 in caveolae-enriched lipid rafts and demonstrate that lovastatin treatment led to down-regulation of LOX-1 in lipid rafts and rescue of the ox-LDL-induced apoptotic phenotype. Taken together, our data reveal a previously unrecognized essential role of membrane cholesterol for LOX-1 receptor activity and suggest that statins protect vascular endothelium against the adverse effect of ox-LDL by disruption of membrane rafts and impairment of LOX-1 receptor function.",
