The concept of inflammation as a pathophysiologic determinant of postoperative atrial fibrillation is supported by the literature. The modulation of post-cardiopulmonary bypass systemic inflammation will probably represent a major therapeutic goal in the prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Visual analog scales were used to assess the effect of the cognitive ADRs on seven quality-of-life domains. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. To target cognitive ADRs with a probable or definite causal relationship to statins, the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale was used: 128 patients (75%) experienced cognitive ADRs determined to be probably or definitely related to statin therapy. Of 143 patients (84%) who reported stopping statin therapy, 128 (90%) reported improvement in cognitive problems, sometimes within days of statin discontinuation (median time to first-noted recovery 2.5 wks). Of interest, in some patients, a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease reportedly was reversed. Nineteen patients whose symptoms improved or resolved after they discontinued statin therapy and who underwent rechallenge with a statin exhibited cognitive problems again (multiple times in some). Within this vulnerable group, a powerful relationship was observed between potency of the statin and fraction of trials with that agent resulting in cognitive ADRs (p<0.00001). Quality of life was significantly adversely affected for each of the seven assessed domains (all p<0.00000001).",

    "44": "Miscarriages in patients with antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies have been attributed to thrombosis of placental vessels. However, we have shown that inflammation plays a crucial role in fetal injury. We identified tissue factor (TF), the major cellular activator of the coagulation cascade, as a key mediator in inflammation and fetal injury in aPL antibody-treated mice. We found that TF in maternal neutrophils was associated with fetal injury. TF expression in neutrophils contributes to the respiratory burst and subsequent trophoblast oxidative injury and pregnancy loss induced by aPL antibodies. We also analysed how TF contributes to neutrophil activation and trophoblast injury in this model. We showed that neutrophils from aPL antibody-treated mice express protease activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) and that stimulation of this receptor leads to neutrophil activation, trophoblast injury and fetal death. Mice deficient in PAR-2 and treated with aPL antibodies exhibited reduced neutrophil activation and normal pregnancies, indicating that PAR-2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of aPL antibody-induced fetal injury. In addition, we demonstrated that the statins simvastatin and pravastatin downregulate TF and PAR-2 expression in neutrophils and thus prevent pregnancy loss. In summary, this study shows that TF signaling through PAR-2 mediates neutrophil activation and fetal death in antiphospholipid syndrome, and that statins may be an appropriate treatment for women with aPL antibody-induced pregnancy complications.", 
    "45": "We recently noticed a possible triglyceride-lowering effect during dietary supplementation with L-arginine. The major limitation of prior studies on L-arginine, however, was that triglyceride levels were not the primary end point, and patients were not necessarily hypertriglyceridemic. Therefore, we conducted a 2-arm, randomized, double-blind study in 33 hypertriglyceridemic patients to investigate the hypothesis that oral L-arginine may lower serum triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridemic patients on and off statins. The study consisted of a 6-week run-in phase, 6 weeks of treatment with L-arginine (n = 22, 1.5 g bid) or placebo (n = 11), and a 6-week extension period where simvastatin (20 mg qd) was added. All patients received dietary advice during each study visit. Routine and lipid laboratory parameters were determined in the local routine clinical laboratory. Treatment with L-arginine alone had no effects on serum lipids compared to placebo. The combination of L-arginine with simvastatin led to a significantly stronger reduction in triglycerides compared to placebo plus simvastatin (-140.5 +/- 149.2 mg/dL vs -56.1 +/- 85.0 mg/dL; P = .048). In addition, we found simvastatin-induced increases in aspartate transaminase and fibrinogen to be attenuated by L-arginine as compared to placebo. We conclude from our data that L-arginine enhances the effects of simvastatin on lipid metabolism, but it has no triglyceride-lowering effects when given alone.", 
    "46": "The present work is the first to deal with the determination of cholesterol synthesis rates in primary rat hepatocytes using transient (13)C-flux analysis. The effects of statins on cholesterol biosynthesis and central carbon fluxes were quantified at a therapeutic concentration of 50 nM atorvastatin using carbon-labeled glutamine. The flux through the cholesterol pathway decreased from 0.27 to 0.08 mmol/l(cv)h in response to the administration of the hypolipidemic drug. Isotopic steady state was reached within 4h in the central carbon metabolism but not in the cholesterol pathway, regardless of whether atorvastatin was administered or not. Marked channeling was observed for the symmetrical tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, succinate and fumarate. Non-stationary (13)C-based flux identification delivers both intracellular fluxes and intermediate levels, which was for the first time utilized for investigating systems-level effects of the administered drug by quantifying the flux control of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.", 
    "47": "Statins are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the western world and play a significant role in reducing cardiovascular risk. However, concern regarding their hepatic safety profile has meant that patients with concurrent liver pathology are often denied such benefits. In this review we consider the evidence for and against the prescription of statins to patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, a group typically associated with high cardiovascular risk. Contrary to current opinion, we find that there is considerable evidence for and little evidence against the prescription of statins to this population and suggest that the guidelines advising against their use in these patients should be reviewed.", 
    "48": "Circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) contribute to endothelial replenishment. Telmisartan is an angiotensin-receptor blocker with PPARgamma-agonistic properties. PPARgamma-agonists and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to enhance EPC number and function. We focused on the effects of telmisartan alone or in combination with simvastatin on EPC. EPC were isolated from healthy human volunteers, cultured and stimulated with telmisartan, simvastatin, or the combination of telmisartan and simvastatin. Telmisartan significantly increased the number of acLDL/lectin double-positive early EPC, the number of colony forming units (EC-CFU) as well as EPC migratory capacity, inhibited TNFalpha-induced EPC apoptosis and reduced glucose-induced oxidative stress. The telmisartan effect was dose-dependent and could be inhibited by GW9662, indicating a PPARgamma-dependent mechanism. The combination of telmisartan and simvastatin led to a significant additive increase in EPC count and function. In wild-type mice, systemic treatment with either telmisartan or simvastatin elevated the number of sca-1/flk-1-positive EPC in bone marrow and peripheral blood, spleen-derived acLDL/lectin double-positive EPC, EPC migration and EC-CFU. Consistent with the in vitro findings, the combination of telmisartan and simvastatin resulted in a further enhancement of EPC counts. Re-endothelialization after carotid injury was significantly enhanced by telmisartan, simvastatin and the combination. Telmisartan increases EPC number and function mediated by a PPARgamma-dependent mechanism. This effect is further enhanced by combination with simvastatin, suggesting a synergistic activation of potentially diverse intracellular pathways.", 
    "49": "Recent evidences suggest a relationship between angiotensin 1 (AT1) receptor gene expression and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) plasma level. We enrolled 16 untreated hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients (57.4 +/- 7 years old) in a randomized, single-blind, cross-over design. All the patients were allocated to treatment with simvastatin 20 mg/day for 2 weeks, then randomly assigned to telmisartan (40-80 mg/day) or bisoprolol (5-10 mg/day). After 4 weeks the antihypertensive drugs have been withdrawn for a wash-out period of 2 weeks when they were treated with simvastatin alone, then they have been allocated to the alternative antihypertensive treatment for four additional weeks. We measured: systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), 24-h mean BP (MBP), Baseline and post-ischemia forearm blood flow (FBF) and vascular resistance (FVR), and Lipid profile. After 2 weeks of treatment with Simvastatin, baseline and post-ischemic FBF increased (both P < 0.05), while baseline and post-ischemic FVR decreased (both P < 0.05). Standing DBP and MBP were reduced more after treatment with telmisartan than with bisoprolol (P < 0.05). Basal and post-ischemic FBF were significantly increased (P < 0.05 and P < 0.005, respectively) and basal and post-ischemic FVR significantly decreased (both P < 0.005) only after treatment with telmisartan, as well as plasma triglycerides (TG) (P < 0.05). From this preliminary study carried out on hypercholesterolemic hypertensive patients it appears that the association of telmisartan and simvastatin (but not of bisoprolol and simvastatin) could exert positive effects on a large quantity of vascular functionality parameters, just after a short treatment.",

The spray-drying technology was used where Plurol Oleique CC 497 was chosen as the oil phase. Effects of carriers, surfactants, and homogenizers on the characteristics of DE containing AC were systematically investigated. The final formulation consisted of dextrin and Poloxamer 188 as carrier and surfactant, respectively, and was homogenized by a high pressure homogenizer before spray drying. The in vitro release of AC from the optimized DE was significantly higher than that of pure AC powder (76% vs. 30% at 24 hr). The in vitro intestinal absorption of AC from the DE formulation was 0.77 microg/cm(2) at 2 hr, which was a 2.33-fold increase compared to the pure unformulated AC powder. These results suggest that the oral dry emulsion formulation could improve the intestinal absorption of AC.",

To investigate effect of endogenous cholesterol on lipid rafts formation and activation of gammadeltaT cells, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated in vitro with Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens (Mtb-Ag). Lovastatin and fluvastatin, two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, were used to block endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis. The expression of ganglioside GM1 (GM1), a lipid rafts marker, and CD69, an activation marker, and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in gammadeltaT cells were measured by flow cytometry. The expression and aggregation of GM1 were also detected with laser confocal microscopy. We found that lovastatin and fluvastatin could obviously inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation and expression of GM1 and CD69 in gammadeltaT cells induced by Mtb-Ag. These results collectively indicated that HMGCR inhibitors might interfere with the formation of lipid rafts and inhibit the activation of gammadeltaT cells induced by Mtb-Ag.",

In total, 2,444 MESA subjects [597 African-Americans (AA), 627 Chinese-Americans (CHA), 612 European-Americans (EA), and 608 Hispanic-Americans (HA)] without statin use were included. Participants had measurements of blood pressure, anthropometry, and fasting blood samples. Subjects were genotyped for 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After excluding SNPs with minor allele frequency <5%, a single block was constructed. The most frequent haplotype was H1 (41-56%) in all ethnic groups except AA (H2a, 44.9%). Lower triglyceride level was associated with the H2a haplotype in AA and H2 in HA. In HA, H4 carriers had higher levels of triglyceride and small low-density lipoprotein (s-LDL), and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), while carriers with H7 or H8 had associations with these traits in the opposite direction. No significant association was discovered in both CHA and EA. The total variation for triglyceride that could be explained by H2 alone was 2.6% in HA and 1.4% in AA. In conclusion, HMGCR gene variation is associated with multiple lipid/lipoprotein traits, especially with triglyceride, s-LDL, and HDL-c. The impact of the genetic variance is modest and differs greatly among ethnicities.", 
    "68": "Residual coronary heart disease remains a significant problem even after adequate statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction as currently recommended by the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). This is particularly true for the high risk patients as defined by ATP-III that includes those patients who have a greater than 20% 10-year risk of adverse cardiac events. For such patients the current goal of a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) maintenance level of < or =100 mg/dL plasma appears to be suboptimal. Accumulating data from several recent randomized studies of more aggressive LDL-cholesterol reduction to levels below 70 mg/dL in the high risk patients favor acceptance of such a new lower target for LDL-cholesterol using more intensive statin therapy which would affect the treatment strategy for patients with coronary heart disease pre-percutaneous intervention, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.", 
    "69": "Circulating inflammatory markers may more strongly relate to risk of fatal versus nonfatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, but robust prospective evidence is lacking. We tested whether interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen more strongly associate with fatal compared to nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke.", 
    "70": "In the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER), baseline inflammatory markers in up to 5,680 men and women aged 70-82 y were related to risk for endpoints; nonfatal CVD (i.e., nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke [n = 672]), fatal CVD (n = 190), death from other CV causes (n = 38), and non-CVD mortality (n = 300), over 3.2-y follow-up. Elevations in baseline IL-6 levels were significantly (p = 0.0009; competing risks model analysis) more strongly associated with fatal CVD (hazard ratio [HR] for 1 log unit increase in IL-6 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.44-2.12) than with risk of nonfatal CVD (1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.31), in analyses adjusted for treatment allocation. The findings were consistent in a fully adjusted model. These broad trends were similar for CRP and, to a lesser extent, for fibrinogen. The results were also similar in placebo and statin recipients (i.e., no interaction). The C-statistic for fatal CVD using traditional risk factors was significantly (+0.017; p<0.0001) improved by inclusion of IL-6 but not so for nonfatal CVD events (p = 0.20).", 
    "71": "In PROSPER, inflammatory markers, in particular IL-6 and CRP, are more strongly associated with risk of fatal vascular events than nonfatal vascular events.

Patients with CAD had normal coronary flow. Coronary flow was quantified using the corrected TIMI frame count (TFC) method and serum levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase were measured. The results were compared with those of a control group consisting of 86 age- and sex-matched patients who had normal coronary arteries and normal coronary flow.", 
    "74": "The three groups were similar with respect to body mass index, presence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, lipid profiles, and fasting glucose. The use of medications was significantly more common in the CAD group (p<0.01). Compared to the control group, serum GGT activity was significantly increased in both SCF and CAD groups (p<0.01), but these two groups did not differ significantly in this respect (p=0.71). The TFCs for all the epicardial coronary arteries and the mean TFC were significantly higher in the SCF group (p<0.01). Patients with CAD and the controls had similar TFC parameters. The mean TFC showed a positive and moderate correlation with serum GGT activity (r=0.326; p<0.001). In regression analysis, serum GGT activity was found as the only independent predictor of the mean TFC (beta=0.309; p<0.001).",

    "76": "The aim of this study was to investigate the modulating effect of atorvastatin on serum paraoxonase 1 enzyme (PON1) activity in type 2 diabetic Egyptian patients with or without nephropathy. The present study was carried out on the following groups: control group, which consisted of 30 healthy persons; Group I, which consisted of 20 type 2 diabetic patients without nephropathy; and Group II, which consisted of 20 type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy. All the patients selected were under an antidiabetic regimen of insulin, and patients receiving antihypertensive agents were excluded from the follow-up study to avoid drug interaction fallacies. Twenty-two patients (15 without nephropathy and seven with nephropathy) received atorvastatin in individually adjusted oral dosage (range 10-20 mg) once per day for 12 weeks. All cases were subjected to thorough clinical examination and history taking and measurement of serum levels of PON1 activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione reductase activity, fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), urea, and creatinine. Urine samples were collected for determination of proteinuria. The obtained results showed that PON1 activity and HDL significantly decreased and fasting glucose significantly increased in Group I and Group II when compared to the control group, with significant difference in their levels between Group II and Group I. MDA, total cholesterol, and LDL levels significantly increased and glutathione reductase activity significantly decreased in Group I and Group II when compared to the control group. Urea, creatinine, and proteinuria levels showed significant increase in Group II when compared to the control group and Group I, with nonsignificant difference between control group and Group I. Atorvastatin therapy caused a significant increase in PON1 activity, and serum levels of MDA and glutathione reductase activity were significantly decreased and increased, respectively. Also, total cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly reduced with a significant increase in HDL-cholesterol levels. There was a significant modest reduction in serum urea and creatinine levels as well as in proteinuria level. Fasting glucose level was significantly reduced under the antidiabetic regimen of insulin through the follow-up period. PON1 activity showed a significant negative correlation with glucose and LDL, and a significant positive correlation with HDL in all the studied groups. It could be concluded that atorvastatin with its pleiotropic effects could provide optimal therapeutic intervention to control not only dyslipidemia, but also oxidative stress status with consequent improvement in the course of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. More specifically, restoration of PON1 activity by atorvastatin opens a window to investigate other drugs that could provide a new adjuvant therapeutic line for better control of diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Further research is also recommended to study the distribution of PON1 genetic polymorphism among the Egyptian population to explain the variability in its activity and its relationship with other factors that associate diabetes and its complications.",

These reports were received by the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb between March 2007 and August 2007. Quantitative data consisted of patient age and gender, number of received reports and characteristics of the report (most frequently reported ADRs, seriousness, drug discontinuation and outcome of the reported reaction). Open text fields in the ADR reporting form were categorized and a content analysis was carried out.", 
    "79": "Media attention led to a peak in patient reporting of ADRs but not in reporting by health professionals. There were no differences between patient and health professional reports in seriousness of the ADRs and drug cessation. Patients reported nonrecovery more often than health professionals. The TV programme is mentioned as a reason for drug discontinuation in almost 30 reports. Patients often felt that they did not receive sufficient information and that their concerns were not adequately addressed by healthcare professionals.", 
    "80": "Media attention affects drug use and ADR reporting by patients. Patient reports can provide additional information, making them a useful source of information next to health professional reports.

Because of the likely use of anacetrapib with hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, we aimed to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with simvastatin.", 
    "82": "A randomized, two-period, two-treatment, balanced, open-label, crossover study in 12 healthy subjects was performed. Subjects received simvastatin 40 mg alone or anacetrapib 150 mg co-administered with simvastatin 40 mg, once daily. Both treatments were administered following a low-fat breakfast for 14 days, separated by a wash-out period of at least 14 days.

The pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were similar with and without anacetrapib administration {AUC(0-24 h) geometric mean ratio [90% confidence interval (CI)] for simvastatin acid and simvastatin were 1.36 [1.17, 1.57] and 1.30 [1.14, 1.47], respectively} based on the prespecified comparability bounds of (0.50, 2.00). Treatment with simvastatin alone led to a mean (95% CI) % reduction from baseline in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) of -36% (-27, -46) compared with a reduction of -54% (-44, -63) for anacetrapib co-administered with simvastatin.", 
    "84": "There appears to be no clinically meaningful effect of anacetrapib on the pharmacokinetic parameters of simvastatin. When co-administered with simvastatin, anacetrapib appeared to exhibit incremental LDL-C-lowering efficacy, due to CETP inhibition. Co-administration of anacetrapib and simvastatin was well tolerated.",

All of the patients were treated with extended-release nifedipine (20 mg twice daily). Thirty (30) normotensive subjects, matched for age and gender, were selected as a control group. Conventional echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging were used to measure the left ventricle (LV) wall thickness and LV diastolic function at weeks 0, 24, and 72 during the period of observation. The serum levels of lipids, carboxy-terminal propeptide of procollagen type I (PIP), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined as well.", 
    "87": "The hypertensive patients had significantly elevated PIP and CRP levels in serum, increased LV wall thickness, and impaired LV diastolic function compared with the normotensive subjects (0.01 < p < 0.05).

Participants were categorized into four groups (roughly quartiles: < or =21; >21 to < or =25; >25 to < or =31 and >31 g/day) of energy-adjusted intake of dietary fibre. Multiple linear regression models were used to adjust for age, sex, centre, smoking, body mass index, diabetes, blood pressure, lipid levels and statin use.",

The results showed that atorvastatin at 10 microM significantly attenuated NF-kappaB activation within 24 hours while at lower doses of 0.1 and 1 microM, treatment time had to be prolonged up to 48 hours for a significant inhibition to occur. The inhibition of NF-kappaB was also observed in a cell line cotransfected with MyD88 and TLR4 suggesting that the attenuation of NF-kappaB by atorvastatin occurred in a MyD88 dependent fashion.",

The primary end point was the success rate, defined as the proportion of patients achieving appropriate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals for their given risk. The mean age of the 9955 evaluable patients was 62+/-12 years; 54% were male. Coronary disease and diabetes mellitus had been diagnosed in 30% and 31%, respectively, and 14% were current smokers. Current treatment consisted of a statin in 75%. The proportion of patients achieving LDL-C goals according to relevant national guidelines ranged from 47% to 84% across countries.

Based upon the results of previous prospective multicenter trials, effective lipid lowering therapy significantly reduces cardiovascular deaths and total morbidity. This beneficial effect correlates with the degree of the LDL-C reduction, which can be usually reached with high doses of statins. These drugs cause hepatotoxicity in 3% of the patients, when used in high doses. The authors briefly review the effects of the lipid lowering drugs and the potential mechanisms by which these drugs may provoke liver injury. They emphasize the fact, that lipid lowering drugs may be used safely in patients with elevated aminotransferase levels or even in subjects with certain definitive liver diseases. However, the clinicians should be cautious to use the appropriate dose and combination to reduce the possibility of the development of adverse events. With these, we can safely provide the beneficial effects of lipid lowering therapy to those with chronic liver disease and high cardiovascular risk.",

Treatment guidelines also identify these as additional targets of lipid-modifying intervention in patients with elevated triglycerides (TG). Even when TG are only moderately elevated, many patients on statin monotherapy who have achieved targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) fail to reach non-HDL-C treatment goals, and even fewer reach apoB goals. Combination lipid-modifying therapy is therefore indicated for comprehensive lipid management, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in whom LDL-C levels are often considered 'optimal'. Of the available options, adding either a niacin, fibrate or omega-3 fatty acids provides greater opportunity to achieve non-HDL-C and apoB targets, given complementary profiles of lipid-modifying activity and supported by evidence from clinical studies. Improvement in lipid control and reduction in atherogenic risk could be anticipated to translate to benefits in clinical outcomes.",

After that, a group was sacrificed and the rest were subjected for another extra 30 days on commercial chow alone or supplemented with coenzyme Q(10), squalene or hydroxytyrosol. Atherosclerotic rabbits had higher fibrosis and endothelial activation and lower cellularity in gingival mucosa than controls (P<0.05). Hydroxytyrosol reduced endothelial activation (P<0.05) and squalene additionally decreased fibrosis (P<0.05). Results suggest that gingival vascular changes after the atherosclerotic diet have been reversed by hydroxytyrosol and squalene, natural products from the minor fraction of virgin olive oil.",

In the cell infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, the first step is contact with the host cell by receptors and ligands on the membrane. It is known that lipids play an important role in the interaction process between pathogens and host cells with lipid rafts being highly specialized regions of the plasma membrane that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. We explored whether the treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin alone or by adding Mevinolin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis could deplete membrane cholesterol of the HEp2 cell and if this treatment could affect the trypomastigote infection into the host cell. These treatments led to a leakage of cholesterol, and concomitantly, PLAP enzyme and unidentified proteins resulting in a decrease of the invasion process. However, the GGTP enzyme was not liberated from the host cell membranes.",

Outcomes of interest were 30-day mortality, need for mechanical ventilation and inotropic support. Multivariable logistic regression was used to compare these outcomes in hypoglycaemic patients to nonhypoglycaemic patients, adjusting for diabetes mellitus, prior statin use and Pneumonia Severity Index. In total, 1,050 patients were included in the study with 5.4% classified as hypoglycaemic. Increased rates of 30-day mortality (28.1% versus 7.5%, p<0.0001), need for mechanical ventilation (29.8% versus 6.5%, p<0.0001) and need for inotropic support (21.1% versus 4.8%, p<0.0001) were observed in hypoglycaemic patients compared with nonhypoglycaemic patients. On multivariable analysis, hypoglycaemia was independently associated with increased 30-day mortality (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.1-4.7; p = 0.03), need for mechanical ventilation (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.9-7.5; p = 0.0002) and need for inotropic support (OR, 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.3; p = 0.0006).

    "123": "Cholesterol-lowering statins have been shown to inhibit growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Epidemiological studies also indicate a chemopreventive effect of statins. We have investigated the effect of statins on Akt/protein kinase B signaling. We found that atorvastatin decreased constitutive- and insulin-induced pAkt in Panc-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Statins also inhibited pAkt in combination with gemcitabine- and 5-fluorouracil, and sensitized cells to gemcitabine- and 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. In line with our previous data, it was found that the P2X7-purinergic receptor mediated the effects of statins in Panc-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. Thus, experiments employing P2X7 siRNA and inhibitors supported an involvement of P2X7. In Capan-2 cells, which expressed P2X7 in low levels, statins did not reduce pAkt levels nor did statins sensitize them to cytostatic drugs. However, statin inhibited the growth of Capan-2 cells and this correlated to inhibition of NFkappaB and Raf/MEK pathways. As shown previously, these latter effects can be explained by an inhibited protein prenylation. Our data suggest that statins primarily target a functional P2X7-Akt signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. By targeting the P2X7-Akt axis, statins can sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Our data are also in line with a role for P2X7 in the chemopreventive effect of statins on pancreatic cancer.",

Three main defense mechanisms are responsible for maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis: the regenerative production of endothelial progenitor cells, vessel wall angiogenesis, and macrophage-mediated reverse cholesterol transport. Endothelial progenitor cells can restore vessel wall function and reduce atherosclerosis. In patients with risk factors, high levels of circulating progenitor cells increase event-free survival from cardiovascular events. Mobilization of progenitor cells includes physical and pharmacological approaches, of which exercise and statin therapy have great potential. Angiogenesis is a pivotal defense mechanism to counteract hypoxia and is needed for plaque regression. However, neovessels are susceptible for intraplaque hemorrhage, particularly in diabetes mellitus. In these patients, the haptoglobin 2-2 genotype is the more affected, and may benefit from an antioxidant approach. Finally, the reverse cholesterol transport system is the main mechanism for plaque regression. In addition to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I therapies and the promotion of cholesterol efflux from macrophages by the ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporter systems hold great promise and may be available for therapeutic application in the near future.",

Significantly greater improvements in the levels of LDL cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and lipid/lipoprotein ratios resulted with ezetimibe/simvastatin compared with atorvastatin at all specified dose comparisons (p <0.001). The attainment of prespecified LDL cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was also significantly greater with ezetimibe/simvastatin than with atorvastatin at all dose comparisons (p <0.05).

The changes in triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were similar for both treatments. The incidence of liver, muscle, and gastrointestinal-, hepatitis- and allergic reaction/rash-related adverse events were low and generally similar to those in previous studies of ezetimibe/simvastatin and/or atorvastatin.

Forty-two patients received tacrolimus from the time of transplant (de novo), and 58 were initially treated with cyclosporine (switch). Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate improved in the first six months post transplant in the de novo group (66.7-84.6 mL/min/1.73 m2, p = 0.002). Conversely, it decreased in those initially treated with cyclosporine (82.1-68.8, p = 0.032), but improved after switch to tacrolimus (77.3-85.6, p = 0.006). Twenty-one percent exhibited glucose intolerance, and 2% had diabetes. Borderline or elevated fasting cholesterol levels were present in 4.4%. Hypertension was seen in 67% at the point of switch from cyclosporine, which fell to 36% at latest follow-up (p = 0.001). These results present an encouraging outlook for this cohort of patients.

    "151": "Converting drugs from the crystalline to the amorphous state has gained increasing interest in the past decades as a potential method to overcome solubility issues of poorly water soluble drugs. A variety of techniques exist to convert the crystalline state of a drug to its amorphous form, including solution based, heat based and solid - solid conversion based methods. Inherent to the amorphous state, regardless of its preparation technique, is its physical instability and tendency to recrystallize. In this study, quench-cooled and cryo-milled simvastatin were compared with regards to their configurational thermodynamic parameters (entropy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy) and mobility (relaxation times calculated using the Adam-Gibbs and Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts method). Stability studies showed quench-cooled simvastatin to be more stable than cryo-milled simvastatin. This was reflected in the calculated parameters although their absolute values did not agree with the stability behaviour. Relaxation time parameters of tau = 6.9 x 10(4) s for quench-cooled and tau = 1.7 x 10(4) s for cryo-milled simvastatin were calculated. The results from this study suggested that differences in the physical stability of amorphous forms prepared by different techniques are reflected in their mobility and thermodynamic parameters. Even though the predictive capabilities of these parameters for a set of different drugs may be limited, they can serve as a predictive tool for physical stability assessment if differently prepared amorphous forms of the same drug are investigated.", 
    "152": "Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, which converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Statins lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by causing intracellular cholesterol depletion and upregulating the expression of LDL receptors. Apart from cholesterol, mevalonate is also the substrate for the synthesis of nonsteroid isoprenoids including farnesylpyrophosphate, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (both attached to small GTP-binding proteins by protein prenyltransferases), coenzyme Q, dolichol, isopentenyladenosine, etc. Depletion of these isoprenoids results in so called \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins which are independent of cholesterol lowering. Although statins are generally well-tolerated, adverse effects may occur in some patients. These effects result from impaired protein prenylation, deficiency of coenzyme Q involved in mitochondrial electron transport and antioxidant protection, abnormal protein glycosylation due to dolichol shortage, or deficiency of selenoproteins. Myopathy is the most frequent side effect of statins and in some cases may have a form of severe rhabdomyolysis. Less common adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, impaired myocardial contractility and autoimmune diseases. The risk of these unfavorable effects is largely outweighed by great reduction of cardiovascular events in statin users.

In people in whom statins were indicated for secondary prevention, the adjusted odds ratio for risk of pneumonia in relation to current statin use was 1.25 (0.94 to 1.67); in those with no such indication, it was 0.81 (0.46 to 1.42).",

The use of a statin or a diabetic medication, alone or in combination, in addition to a PGA, made no significant difference in the need for adjunct glaucoma therapy.

    "185": "CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that are highly expressed in the liver and gut and metabolize endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. The bioavailability of statins is affected by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and glucuronidases metabolism as well as uptake and efflux transporters that affect drug disposition. CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 variants have been demonstrated to influence the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of statins. Inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 play an important role in reducing statin efficacy and increase the risk of adverse effects, respectively. Statins have been demonstrated to increase CYP3A expression in vitro, most likely because they are ligands to nuclear receptors (pregnane X receptor and constitutive androsterone receptor) that form heterodimers with retinoid X receptors and bind to responsive elements in the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 promoter regions. This special report outlines the earlier studies on variability of response to statins owing to CYP3A variants and highlights findings on the induction of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 expression by statins.", 
    "186": "This report focuses on the effects of cholesterol on the expression and function of the ATP-binding cassette (ABCB1, ABCG2 and ABCC2) and solute-linked carrier (SLCO1B1 and SLCO2B1) drug transporters with a particular focus on the potential impact of cholesterol on lipid-lowering drug disposition. Statins are the most active agents in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. However, considerable interindividual variation exists in the response to statin therapy. Therefore, it would be huge progress if factors were identified that reliably differentiate between responders and nonresponders. Many studies have suggested that plasma lipid concentrations can affect drug disposition of compounds, such as ciclosporin and amphotericin B. Both compounds are able to affect the expression and function of ABC transporters. Although still speculative, these effects might be owing to the regulation of drug transporters by plasma cholesterol levels. Studies with normo- and hyper-cholesterolemic individuals, before and after atorvastatin treatment, have demonstrated that plasma cholesterol levels are correlated with drug transporter expression, as well as being related to atorvastatin's cholesterol-lowering effect. The mechanism influencing the correlation between cholesterol levels and the expression and function of drug transporters remains unclear. Some studies provide strong evidence that nuclear receptors, such as the pregnane X receptor and the constitutive androstane receptor, mediate this effect. In the near future, pharmacogenomic studies with individuals in a pathological state should be performed in order to identify whether high plasma cholesterol levels might be a factor contributing to interindividual oral drug bioavailability.", 
    "187": "The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) has an essential role in the formation of nascent high-density lipoprotein particles and also participates in the cholesterol efflux from macrophages in the artery wall. Several substances, such as statins, or even gene variants are able to modulate ABCA1 expression. There is strong evidence that statin treatment downregulates the ABCA1 expression in nonloaded macrophages. Interestingly, in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, which are more relevant to atherogenesis, this effect is lost. We observed an inhibitory effect of atorvastatin in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of hypercholesterolemic individuals. Moreover, in these individuals, the ABCA1 -14C>T polymorphism was associated with high baseline gene-expression levels. Other studies are needed to evaluate how relevant these findings are to the formation of arterial foam cells in vivo.",

It is supposed that genetic predisposition plays an important role in these differences, but the contribution of individual polymorphisms is poorly understood.

Apolipoprotein A5 is an important determinant of plasma lipid concentrations and its genetic variation could account for some of the observed differences in the response to statin therapy. However, this has not been analyzed before.",

The study period was from 1 January 1985 to 31 December 2006, limited to males aged 13-80 years.

The mean delay of onset of ED after starting statins, known for 19 cases, was 62 days (median 29 days). In 56.9% of cases, recovery occurred after withdrawal of statin, and rechallenge was positive in five cases. The association was statistically significant for all statins (adjusted ROR [aROR] = 2.4; 95% CI 1.8, 3.3), simvastatin (aROR = 2.6; 1.6, 4.1), atorvastatin (aROR = 3.4; 2.1, 5.4) and rosuvastatin (aROR = 7.1; 2.6, 19.4) [p < 0.001 for all] but not for pravastatin and fluvastatin. We did not find any relationship between the occurrence of ED and the daily dose or the duration of exposure to statins (data not shown). Assessment of the association between drugs other than statins known to be at risk of ED confirmed a significant association for finasteride (aROR = 14.5; 95% CI 8.3, 25.4), fibrates (aROR = 3.6; 2.6, 5.1), beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (aROR = 1.5; 1.01, 2.1) and tricyclic antidepressants (aROR = 2.0; 1.2, 3.4) [all p < 0.05].",

A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the lipid response to statin treatment among APOE genetic variants (e2 carriers, e3e3 homozygotes and e4 carriers). Twenty-four studies were included in the meta-analyses. The pooled mean reduction (Delta mu) in TC from baseline was significant for all variants (e2 carriers: Delta mu=-27.7% (-32.5 to -22.8%), e3e3: Delta mu=-25.3% (-28.0 to -22.6%) and e4 carriers: Delta mu=-25.1% (-29.3 to -21.0%)). Significant changes in LDL-C, HDL-C and triglyceride levels were also noted for all genotypes, although these changes did not differ significantly among genotypic groups. There was significant heterogeneity among the studies. Given these non-significant effects of APOE genotypes on lipid responses, there is little reason to consider the use of APOE genetic testing for guiding treatment with statins.",

The spectrum of statin-related myopathy ranges from common but clinically benign myalgia to rare but life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Observational studies suggest that myalgia can occur in up to 10% of persons prescribed statins, whereas rhabdomyolysis continues to be rare. The mechanisms of statin-related myopathy are unclear. Options for managing statin myopathy include statin switching, particularly to fluvastatin or low-dose rosuvastatin; nondaily dosing regimens; nonstatin alternatives, such as ezetimibe and bile acid-binding resins; and coenzyme Q10 supplementation. Few of these strategies have high-quality evidence supporting them. Because statin-related myopathy will probably become more common with greater numbers of persons starting high-dose statin therapy and the increasing stringency of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level targets, research to better identify patients at risk for statin myopathy and to evaluate management strategies for statin-related myopathy is warranted.",

There are few data describing the impact of antihypertensive therapy on retinal vascular changes. This substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial compared the effects of an amlodipine-based regimen (373 patients) with an atenolol-based regimen (347 patients) on retinal microvascular measurements made from fundus photographs. The retinal photographs were taken at a stage in the trial when treatments were stable and blood pressure was well controlled. Amlodipine-based treatment was associated with a smaller arteriolar length:diameter ratio than atenolol-based treatment (13.32 [10.75 to 16.04] versus 14.12 [11.27 to 17.81], median [interquartile range]; P<0.01). The association remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, body mass index, smoking, and statin treatment. This effect appeared to be largely attributable to shorter retinal arteriolar segment lengths in the amlodipine-treated group and is best explained by the vasodilator effects of amlodipine causing the visible emergence of branching side vessels. Photographic assessment of the retinal vascular network may be a useful approach to evaluating microvascular structural responses in clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy.",

Actein, an active component from the herb black cohosh, has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human breast cancer cells. To conduct our assessment, we determined the molecular effects of actein on livers from Sprague-Dawley rats treated with actein at 35.7 mg/kg for 6 and 24 h. Chemogenomic analyses indicated that actein elicited stress and statin-associated responses in the liver; actein altered expression of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic genes, p53 pathway genes, CCND1 and ID3. Real-time RT-PCR validated that actein induced three time-dependent patterns of gene expression in the liver: (i) a decrease followed by a significant increase of HMGCS1, HMGCR, HSD17B7, NQO1, S100A9; (ii) a progressive increase of BZRP and CYP7A1 and (iii) a significant increase followed by a decrease of CCND1 and ID3. Consistent with actein's statin- and stress-associated responses, actein reduced free fatty acid and cholesterol content in the liver by 0.6-fold at 24 h and inhibited the growth of human HepG2 liver cancer cells. To determine the bioavailability of actein, we collected serum samples for pharmacokinetic analysis at various times up to 24 h. The serum level of actein peaked at 2.4 microg/mL at 6 h.

As such, statins seem unlikely to be ever regarded as antitumor agents. However, statins are regularly taken by many elderly cancer patients for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Owing to their pleiotropic effects in normal and tumor cells, statins interact in various ways with many antitumor treatment modalities, either potentiating or diminishing their effectiveness. Elucidation of these interactions might affect the choice of treatment to be planned in cancer patients as some combinations might be contraindicated, whereas others might elicit potentiated antitumor effects but at a cost of increased general toxicity. Some other combinations might induce either comparable or even stronger antitumor effects, but with a beneficial concomitant reduction of specific side effects.

Synovial tissues were obtained from patients with RA at the time of total knee arthroplasty. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) cultured in three passages were used for the experiments. The FLS were then cultured for 48 h in 48-well flat-bottomed plates containing various concentrations of GGA (0.1-4.0 microg/ml) and either 0.1 or 0.5 microM Fluv. We also examined the effect of GGA and Fluv in human fibroblasts from normal skin (CCD-25SK) and FLS from patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Cells demonstrating cell death were counted following trypan blue staining. In the absence of GGA, there was no apparent cell death, as evidence by trypan blue staining. Concentrations of GGA between 0.1 and 4.0 microg/ml induced cell death in RA FLS, but not in skin fibroblasts (CCD-25SK) nor OA FLS. The number of synoviocytes demonstrating cell death induced by 0.1 or 0.5 microM Fluv was significantly higher than that by the medium alone. In summary, we found that GGA induced cell death in RA FLS, suggesting that GGA may be a potential new therapeutic agent for RA as well as osteoporosis.",

Recent studies have shown statins possess pleiotropic effects, which appear to be independent from its cholesterol-lowering action. In this study, we investigated whether atorvastatin would have protective effects against hippocampal cell death promoted by quinolinic acid (QA)-induced seizures in mice. Mice were pretreated with Atorvastatin (1 or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline, 0.9%), orally, once a day for 7 days before the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) QA infusion (36.8 nmol/site). Atorvastatin treatment with 1 mg/kg/day did not significantly prevent QA-induced seizures (13.34%). However, administration of atorvastatin 10 mg/kg/day prevented the clonic and/or tonic seizures induced by QA in 29.41% of the mice. Additionally, administration of atorvastatin 10 mg/kg/day significantly prevented QA-induced cell death in the hippocampus. Atorvastatin treatment promoted an increased Akt phosphorylation, which was sustained after QA infusion in both convulsed and non-convulsed mice. Moreover, atorvastatin pretreatment prevented the reduction in glutamate uptake into hippocampal slices induced by QA i.c.v. infusion. These results show that atorvastatin attenuated QA-induced hippocampal cellular death involving the Akt pathway and glutamate transport modulation. Therefore, atorvastatin treatment might be a useful strategy in the prevention of brain injury caused by the exacerbation of glutamatergic toxicity in neurological diseases such as epilepsy.", 
    "232": "The effects of statins on platelet activation markers, chemokines and adiponectin, were investigated in 135 patients with hyperlipidemia. Of the 135 hyperlipidemic patients, 63 were allocated to the simvastatin group, treated with simvastatin at the dose of 10 mg daily, and the remaining 72 were allocated to the pitavastatin group, treated with pitavastatin at the dose of 2 mg daily. Plasma levels of platelet-derived microparticles (PDMP), cell adhesion molecules (sCD40L and sP-selectin), chemokines [monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted] and adiponectin were measured at the baseline and after 6 months of treatment in both the groups. In addition, we carried out a basic study to investigate the MCP-1-dependent induction of tissue factor expression on a histiocytic cell line (U937 cells). The plasma levels of PDMP, sCD40L, sP-selectin, regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted and MCP-1 were higher, whereas those of adiponectin were lower, in the hyperlipidemic patients than in the normolipidemic controls. Plasma PDMP and sCD40L were positively correlated, whereas plasma adiponectin was negatively correlated, with the plasma levels of MCP-1. No significant differences in the plasma levels of PDMP, sCD40L, sP-selectin, regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted and MCP-1 measured before and after treatment were observed in either the simvastatin or pitavastatin group. A significant increase of the plasma adiponectin levels was observed after 6 months of treatment with pitavastatin but not after an equal duration of treatment with simvastatin. When pitavastatin-treated patients were divided into two groups according to the adiponectin response to pitavastatin treatment, significant decreases of the plasma MCP-1, PDMP and sCD40L levels were observed after pitavastatin treatment in the responder group. In the aforementioned basic study, MCP-1 by itself did not induce the expression of tissue factor on the U937 cells. However, the recombinant sCD40L-induced expression of tissue factor on U937 was enhanced by the addition of MCP-1. These findings suggest that PDMP, sCD40L and MCP-1 may participate in the development of atherothrombosis in patients with hyperlipidemia and that pitavastatin may exert an adiponectin-dependent antiatherothrombotic effect in hyperlipidemic patients."
