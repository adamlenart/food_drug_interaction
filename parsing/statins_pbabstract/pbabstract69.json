Simvastatin was used as a model drug and loaded into DMSS and the mesoporous core without the shell (MSC) by the solvent evaporation method. The drug loading efficiency of DMSS and MSC were determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV). Characterization, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen adsorption, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) showed that simvastatin adsorbed in DMSS and MSC was in an amorphous state, and in vitro release test results demonstrated that both DMSS and MSC increased the water solubility and dissolution rate of simvastatin. The shell structure of DMSS was able to regulate the release of simvastatin compared with MSC. It is worth noting that DMSS has significant potential as a carrier for improving the dissolution of poorly water-soluble drugs and reducing the rapid release.",

The present study is aimed to assess whether a general practitioner auditing and feedback EP may improve dyslipidaemia management in a primary care setting and to evaluate patients' adherence to prescribed lipid-lowering treatment. The quality of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease prevention before and after the implementation of an EP offered to 25 general practitioners (GPs), was evaluated. Clinical and prescription data on patients receiving at least one lipid-lowering treatment was collected. To evaluate the quality of the healthcare service provided, clinical and biochemical outcomes, and drug-utilization, process indicators were set up. Adherence was evaluated before and after the EP as the \"Medication Possession Ratio\" (MPR). A correlation analysis was carried out to estimate the effect of the MPR in achieving pre-defined clinical end-points. Prescription data for lipid-lowering drugs was collected in a sample of 839 patients. While no differences in the achievement of blood lipid targets were observed, a slight but significant improvement of the MPR was registered after the EP (MPR >0.8=64.2% vs 60.6%, p=0.0426).

Atorvastatin decreased BA pool size, mainly due to less BA in the intestine. Surprisingly, atorvastatin did not alter total BAs in the serum or liver. Atorvastatin increased the ratio of 12\u03b1-OH/non12\u03b1-OH BAs. Atorvastatin increased the mRNAs of the BA-synthetic enzymes cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1) (over 10-fold) and cytochrome P450 27a1, the BA uptake transporters Na\u207a/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1b2, and the efflux transporter multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 in the liver. Noticeably, atorvastatin suppressed the expression of BA nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) target genes, namely small heterodimer partner (liver) and fibroblast growth factor 15 (ileum). Furthermore, atorvastatin increased the mRNAs of the organic cation uptake transporter 1 and cholesterol efflux transporters Abcg5 and Abcg8 in the liver. The increased expression of BA-synthetic enzymes and BA transporters appear to be a compensatory response to maintain BA homeostasis after atorvastatin treatment. The Cyp7a1 induction by atorvastatin appears to be due to suppressed FXR signaling in both the liver and intestine.",

The following two hypotheses were explored to explain the rate differences: \"effective intervention\" (changes in weight and other factors due to intensive lifestyle intervention) and \"exhaustion of susceptible\" (changes in mean genetic and diabetes risk scores). No combination of behavioral risk factors (weight, physical activity, diet, smoking, and antidepressant or statin use) explained the lower DPPOS rates of diabetes progression in the placebo and metformin groups, whereas weight gain was the factor associated with higher rates of progression in the intensive lifestyle intervention group. Different patterns in the average genetic risk score over time were consistent with exhaustion of susceptibles. Results were consistent with exhaustion of susceptibles for the change in incidence rates, but not the availability of intensive lifestyle intervention to all persons before the beginning of the DPPOS. Thus, effective intervention did not explain the lower diabetes rates in the DPPOS among subjects in the placebo and metformin groups compared with those in the DPP.",

These EMT-like changes were also observed in HPMCs treated with geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (5 \u00b5M). HG significantly increased the protein expression of RhoA and Rac1 in the membrane fractions, and these increases were ameliorated by simvastatin (p<0.05). In PD rats, E-cadherin in the peritoneum was significantly decreased, whereas \u03b1-SMA, Snail, and fibronectin expression were significantly increased (p<0.05) compared to C rats.

    "63": "In view that several studies have shown a positive correlation between high cholesterol and an increase in the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) statins have been proposed as alternative drugs for its treatment and/or prevention. However, the potential benefits of statins remain controversial. Although they have lipid-lowering properties, statins also have pleiotropic effects that are unrelated to cholesterol reduction and have a wide range of biological implications whose consequences in brain function have not been fully characterized. In this work we analyze different studies that have reported both, beneficial and toxic effects for statins in the central nervous system (CNS), and we revise the literature that claims their potential for treating AD. First, we present an overview of the cholesterol metabolism and its regulation in the brain in order to provide the framework for understanding the pathological association between altered cholesterol and AD. Then, we describe the cholesterol-lowering and pleiotropic properties of statins that have been reported in vivo and in in vitro models. We conclude that the effects of statins in the brain are broad and complex and that their use for treating several diseases including AD should be carefully analyzed given their multiple and broad effects.", 
    "64": "The cardiovascular pleiotropic effects of statins and a Rho-kinase inhibitor (fasudil) could be of interest to prevent myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury (MIRI). In the present study, we investigated whether low-dose rosuvastatin and fasudil, separately not possessing cardioprotection, express cardioprotective effects when combined. The isolated rat hearts underwent 30 min global ischemia and 120 min reperfusion. Rosuvastatin (3 microM) and fasudil (1 microM) were administered 15 min before ischemia. NG-nitro-L-arginine methylester (30 microM) (L-NAME) was given at the onset of reperfusion. Myocardial infarct size, apoptosis, myocardial nitric oxide (NO) content and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression were evaluated. The combination treatment significantly decreased infarct size and percentage of apoptosis and increased the content of NO and eNOS expression, whereas treatment with rosuvastatin and fasudil alone at the same doses did not lead to cardioprotection. Furthermore, L-NAME reversed the cardioprotective effect of rosuvastatin/fasudil combination treatment. In summary, rosuvastatin combined with fasudil treatment had synergistic protective effects against MIRI, which were mediated by increasing eNOS and NO production. This new concept could be valuable in MIRI prevention.", 
    "65": "The recent American guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults have confused the debate in comparison with the European guidelines. These US guidelines prefer the notion of intensity of reduction of blood cholesterol based on the level of cardiovascular risk rather than a LDL cholesterol level target recommended by the European guidelines. Moreover, only the use of statins is recommended without any consideration for alternative pharmacological approaches in special situations. Even if we can find some similarities between these two guidelines, it is of interest to compare them carefully in order to justify the reasons why preference should be given to European guidelines.", 
    "66": "The present work evaluated whether dietary and pharmacological interference on cholesterol synthesis were capable of inducing alterations in blood and yolk cholesterol levels and the secretion of corticosterone metabolites. Forty-five 40-day-old quails were divided into three experimental groups: vegetal fat diet, 2% beef fat (tallow) diet and vegetal fat diet with simvastatin administration (3.13 mg/kg/day). During all experiments, the animal weights and food consumption were recorded and blood and faecal samples (days 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60), as well as eggs (days 30, 45 and 60), were collected. Analysis of serum and yolk cholesterol was performed and faecal corticosterone levels were measured. No differences were observed on blood cholesterol or faecal corticosterone between all treatments, despite a tendency of increased cholesterol in the group with the animal fat diet. However, quails submitted to an animal fat diet displayed an increase in yolk cholesterol at day 30 of the treatment and the egg yolks of quails treated with simvastatin exhibited a decrease in cholesterol content by the end of the treatment at 60 days. These results improved the knowledge regarding the physiology of quails and offered support to other studies concerning the consequences of the pharmacological treatment and the dietary manipulation of cholesterol levels.",

This contains electronic medical records of the general population registered with a UK general practice. Individual CVD risks were estimated using competing risk regression models. Individual differences in the 10-year CVD risks as predicted by risk scores and competing risk models were estimated; the population was divided into 20 subgroups based on predicted risk. CVD outcomes occurred in 69,870 persons. In the subgroup with lowest risks, risk predictions by QRISK2 were similar to individual risks predicted using our competing risk model (99.9% of people had differences of less than 2%); in the subgroup with highest risks, risk predictions varied greatly (only 13.3% of people had differences of less than 2%). Larger deviations between QRISK2 and our individual predicted risks occurred with calendar year, different ethnicities, diabetes mellitus and number of records for medical events in the electronic health records in the year before the index date. A QRISK2 estimate of low 10-year CVD risk (<15%) was confirmed by Framingham, ASSIGN and our individual predicted risks in 89.8% while an estimate of high 10-year CVD risk (\u2265 20%) was confirmed in only 48.6% of people. The majority of cases occurred in people who had predicted 10-year CVD risk of less than 20%.",

The purpose of these studies was to examine the chemopreventive effects of pravastatin alone and in combination with pineal hormone melatonin in the N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary carcinogenesis model. Pravastatin was given orally (1 00 mg/kg) and melatonin was added to the water (20 \u03bcg/ml). Chemoprevention began seven days prior to carcinogen administration and subsequently continued for 15 weeks until autopsy. At autopsy, mammary tumours were removed and prepared for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Parameters of experimental carcinogenesis, mechanism of action (biomarkers of apoptosis, angiogenesis and proliferation) and side effects after long-term treatment in animals were assessed. Pravastatin alone suppressed tumour frequency by 20.5% and average tumour volume by 15% compared with controls. Combined administration of the drugs decreased tumour frequency by 69% and lengthened tumour latency by nine days compared with control animals. The ration between high and low grade carcinomas was apparently reduced in both treated groups. The analysis of carcinoma cells showed significant expression increase in caspase-3 and caspase-7 after pravastatin treatment; however, combined treatment even more pronounced increase in the expression of both caspases. Regarding VEGFR-2 expression, a small effect in carcinomas of both treated groups was found. In plasma metabolism evaluation, pravastatin alone significantly decreased levels of glucose and triacylglycerols. Our results suggest a mild anti-neoplastic effect of pravastatin in this rat mammary gland carcinoma model. Statins co-administered with other suitable drug (e.g. melatonin) should be further evaluated for tumour-preventive properties.",

Patients are randomized to receive alirocumab 75 mg via a single, subcutaneous, 1-mL injection by prefilled pen every 2 weeks (Q2W) as add-on therapy to atorvastatin (20-40 mg) or rosuvastatin (10-20 mg); or to receive ezetimibe 10 mg/d as add-on therapy to statin; or to receive statin up-titration; or to switch from atorvastatin to rosuvastatin (OPTIONS I only). At week 12, based on week 8 LDL-C levels, the alirocumab dose may be increased from 75 mg to 150 mg Q2W if LDL-C levels remain \u2265100 mg/dL or \u226570 mg/dL in patients with high or very high CV risk, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies is difference in percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24 in the alirocumab vs control arms. The studies may provide guidance to inform clinical decision-making when patients with CV risk require additional lipid-lowering therapy to further reduce LDL-C levels. The flexibility of the alirocumab dosing regimen allows for individualized therapy based on the degree of LDL-C reduction required to achieve the desired LDL-C level.",

    "84": "Statins are increasingly being recognized as anti-cancer agents against various cancers including breast cancer. To understand the molecular pathways targeted by fluvastatin and its differential sensitivity against metastatic breast cancer cells, we analyzed protein alterations in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with fluvastatin using 2-DE in combination with LC-MS/MS. Results revealed dys-regulation of 39 protein spots corresponding to 35 different proteins. To determine the relevance of altered protein profiles with breast cancer cell death, we mapped these proteins to major pathways involved in the regulation of cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cell cycle, Rho GDI and proteasomal pathways using IPA analysis. Highly interconnected sub networks showed that vimentin and ERK1/2 proteins play a central role in controlling the expression of altered proteins. Fluvastatin treatment caused proteolysis of vimentin, a marker of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. This effect of fluvastatin was reversed in the presence of mevalonate, a downstream product of HMG-CoA and caspase-3 inhibitor. Interestingly, fluvastatin neither caused an appreciable cell death nor did modulate vimentin expression in normal mammary epithelial cells. In conclusion, fluvastatin alters levels of cytoskeletal proteins, primarily targeting vimentin through increased caspase-3- mediated proteolysis, thereby suggesting a role for vimentin in statin-induced breast cancer cell death.",

Statins might carry a deleterious effect on muscle function leading to myopathy and therefore affecting functional recovery. We evaluated the relationship between statin exposure at in-hospital rehabilitation admission and functional outcome at discharge. This was a retrospective cohort study of older patients 70 years and older consecutively admitted to an in-hospital rehabilitation after an acute hospitalization. Statin exposure was measured at the time of rehabilitation admission. Functional status was defined with the Barthel Index (BI) score at the time of discharge. A multi-variable linear regression model was used to evaluate the association between statin exposure and functional status at discharge adjusting for potential confounders through a propensity score for statin exposure. A total of 2435 patients were included. The cohort had a mean age of 81.1 years. Of these 9% (n=220) were on statins at the time of admission. In the multi-variable analysis, the use of statins at the time of admission was independently associated with an improved functional status at discharge (point estimate 5.2; 95% confidence interval 1.5-8.9; p<0.01) after adjusting for relevant confounders. Patients who were receiving statins at the time of admission had a BI score 5 points higher compared to those who were not receiving statins.

The drug was proved to be miscible with Soluplus by calculation and measurements. The solubility, dissolution, thermal characteristics, interactions and physical stability of the SIM/Soluplus SDs were investigated. The crystal state of simvastatin in the SD was found to change from crystalline to amorphous form during the HME process and also hydrogen bonds were observed between SIM and the extruded Soluplus. The phase solubility showed the solubilization effect of Soluplus was strong and spontaneous. The equilibrium solubility illustrated that Soluplus/SIM SDs gained much higher solubility than its corresponding physical mixtures (PMs). Both of the dissolution profiles and in-vivo performance showed that the SIM/Soluplus SD obtained a marked enhancement, compared with the PM. There was a little change in the SIM/Soluplus SD during a 3-month storage period (40\u2009\u00b0C, 75%), indicating the good physicochemical stability.

We report that statins upregulate mir-148b and 152, and affect HLA-G expression in an rs1063320-dependent fashion. In addition, we found that individuals who carried the G minor allele of rs1063320 had reduced asthma-related exacerbations (emergency department visits, hospitalizations or oral steroid use) compared with non-carriers (P=0.03) in statin users ascertained in the Personalized Medicine Research Project at the Marshfield Clinic (n=421).

Besides, the effect of above drugs on the cells viability was estimated by MTT test. After 6, 12 or 24 h of simultaneous incubation of GMK cells with methotrexate (5.5 micromol/L) and simvastatin (100 micromol/L) the cytotoxicity (about 10%) of the drugs was found in LDH test. Cytotoxicity of combination: methotrexate (5.5 micromol/L) with simvastatin (300 micromol/L) after 6 or 12 h of incubation with GMK cells was similar (about 10%), but after 24 h of incubation, cytotoxicity increased to 21%. The significant increase of the cytotoxicity (about 30%) was found after 24 h incubation of GMK cells with methotrexate (16.5 micromol/L) and simvastatin (100 micromol/L).

The patients were divided in two groups with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min (n = 31) and = > 60 ml/min. The former were given 20 mg atorvastatin/day. Arterial pressure (AP): systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP), and pulse (PAP) pressure, plasma lipid profile, uricemia, HbA(1c) and GFR were measured at admission and 6 months after the onset of therapy. The use of atorvastatin in combined therapy of CRD of non-diabetic genesis resulted in a significant decrease of the levels of atherogenic lipids, HbA(1c), uricemia, lipid peroxidation, SAP and PAP (by 4-5 mm Hg) while the initially low GFR (< 60 ml/min) increased.

Nevertheless, it is important to remember certain characteristics in older persons, such as biological and metabolic changes or the higher incidence of atherogenic dyslipidemia, which will affect them. Moreover, quality of life and maintaining independence rather than mere survival are especially important in older individuals, as demonstrated by various surveys.

Notably, this effect was accompanied by disruption of RAS membrane localization and ERK downregulation. In addition, the apoptotic effect of this combination was associated with downregulation of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 protein and activation of the caspase cascade.

The most direct way to correct for differences in transporter abundance between cell-lines and tissue is by using absolute protein quantification. In the present study, the performance of this strategy to predict human hepatic uptake transport was investigated and compared with traditional scaling from primary human hepatocytes. Rosuvastatin was used as a model compound. The uptake activity was measured in HEK293 cell-lines stably overexpressing OATP1B1(\u2217)1a, OATP1B3 or OATP2B1, the major transporters involved in human hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin, or expressing OATP1B1(\u2217)15, associated with reduced hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin. The abundance of these transporter proteins in the outer membranes of HEK293-cells, in human primary hepatocytes and in human liver tissue was determined by LC-MS/MS. The measured activity, corrected for protein abundance and scaled to the whole liver, gave a very accurate prediction of the hepatic intrinsic clearance observed in vivo. Embedded in a PBPK model describing the hepatic disposition and enterohepatic circulation, the collective in vitro data resulted in a good explanation of the observed oral and intravenous pharmacokinetic profiles of rosuvastatin. The model allowed simulation of the effect of polymorphic variants of OATP1B1 on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics. These results encourage a larger scale validation. This approach may facilitate prediction of drug-drug interactions, scaling of transporter processes across subpopulations (children, diseased patients), and may be extended to tissues for which primary cells may be more difficult to obtain.",

Since inflammation in the central nervous system was highly related to morphine tolerance, we sought to investigate whether statins could affect morphine tolerance by mediating glia-derived proinflammatory cytokines secretion. We have undertaken two separate studies: Firstly, we determined the effect of rosuvastatin on na\u00efve rats during induction of morphine tolerance. Secondly, we investigated whether rosuvastation could attenuate the morphine analgesic tolerance in rats that the morphine tolerance established previously. Results demonstrated that peroral rosuvastatin not only delays, but also partially reverses the tolerance to morphine analgesia in rats. The administration of rosuvastatin during induction of morphine tolerance attenuated the activation of ERK and the release of proinflammatory cytokines in the lumbar spinal cord. Similar outcomes were observed in rats were morphine tolerance was established previously. Moreover, our study also found that repeated administration of morphine could activate the astrocytes in the spinal cord while rosuvastation succeeds in suppressing the activation of astrocytes. Our results support the idea that targeting glia-derived proinflammatory effects during morphine treatment is a novel and clinically promising method for enhancing analgesic effects of morphine. We identify a potential new application of statins in the treatment of morphine analgesic tolerance.",

In this study, we tested whether a new therapeutic approach consisting of low-dose treatment with a statin and sartan combination could prevent atherogenic diet-induced impairment of the arterial wall in guinea pigs. Twenty-five Dunkin-Hartley guinea pigs were randomly assigned to five experimental groups: 1) normal diet; 2) atherogenic diet (AD); 3) AD + a low-dose atorvastatin and valsartan combination (5mg/kg/day and 2.4mg/kg/day, respectively); 4) AD + low-dose atorvastatin (5mg/kg/day); 5) AD + low-dose valsartan (2.4mg/kg/day). After 8 weeks of treatment, the animals were killed, blood samples collected and thoracic and abdominal aortas isolated. The atherogenic diet significantly impaired maximal thoracic aorta endothelium-dependent relaxation by 40.1% relative to the normal diet. The low-dose combination, compared to the separate drugs, completely preserved thoracic aorta endothelium-dependent relaxation at the level of the group receiving normal diet. This substantial effect was associated with a significant change in the expression of NOS3 (R=0.93; P=0.0002) and IL1b (R=-0.79; P=0.003) genes. In addition, treatment with the low-dose combination or the separate drugs also prevented atherosclerotic plaque formation.

The results demonstrate the widespread applicability of the QCEIMS method for the unbiased computation of EI mass spectra even for larger molecules. Its strengths compared to standard (static) or database driven approaches in such cases are highlighted.

The exact mechanism of statin-induced autoimmune reactions is unclear. Statins, as proapoptotic agents, release nuclear antigen into the circulation and may induce the production of pathogenic autoantibodies.

We hypothesize that lovastatin, as a disease-modifying drug, would counterweigh the absence of FMRP and improve behavior. Here we report a phase I study to assess the safety and efficacy of lovastatin in individuals with FXS. A total of 15 patients (13 males, 6-31 years old) were treated with escalating doses of lovastatin (up to 40\u2009mg) for three months. Their behavior were assessed before and after treatment using the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist--Community (ABC-C) total score (primary outcome), as well as domains of the FXS validated version of the ABC-C (secondary outcomes). The treatment was well tolerated and minimal side effects were reported. Significant improvement in the primary outcome (P<0.005), as well as in secondary outcomes, were observed in the majority of the subjects (12/15). We think that long-term sustained treatment with diseased-modifying drugs would be necessary in order to improve behavior and ultimately learning. Lovastatin, well known for its long-term security profile, would be a good candidate for that purposes. Our study showing reassuring safety data along with potential functional benefit emphasizes the need of a placebo-controlled trial to ascertain lovastatin efficacy in FXS individuals.",

Although treatment with apheresis and lipid-lowering drugs has improved event-free survival of HoFH patients, the condition is still associated with early onset cardiovascular disease and death due to residual high cholesterol levels. Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins are powerful cholesterol-lowering agents, but HoFH patients are often inadequately controlled on statins alone; therefore, a variety of other medications, including the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants and niacin, have been used to try to achieve recommended LDL-C goals. However, even in patients with access to the best available treatments, HoFH has continued to be associated with extreme rates of morbidity and premature mortality. The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor lomitapide has recently received regulatory approval in the European Union and the United States of America for use in patients with HoFH and a number of other agents are currently in development, including apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotides (approved in the US), and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors.

Although no established applications of personalized genomics in cardiovascular medicine yet exist, there are at least two emerging applications that may ultimately become everyday practice. In the first application, DNA sequence variants that have been found to be associated with cardiovascular disease may be incorporated in risk-prediction algorithms to more accurately forecast whether patients will develop disease. In the second application, known as pharmacogenomics, DNA sequence variants that have been found to be associated with either beneficial effects or adverse effects of a medication may be used to help decide which medications or dosages of medications to prescribe to patients.

She was initiated on the acute coronary syndrome protocol and underwent emergency left heart catheterisation on the day of admission. The coronary angiogram revealed large aneurysmal dilations in the right coronary artery and left main stem. A ventriculogram showed poor left ventricular (LV) systolic function in line with subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram, which revealed her to have an left ventricular ejection-fraction (LVEF) of approximately 20%. It was agreed with the cardiothoracic surgeons to treat the aneurysms non-operatively and start low-molecular weight heparin. Furthermore the underlying biventricular impairment was treated with ACE-inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers and diuretic therapy (loop and potassium-sparing). The strategy was to prevent further thrombus formation with the aneurysmal vessels and to achieve this the patient was initiated on lifelong warfarin.

If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10\u00a0years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.",

These lipid changes represent the major link between diabetes and the increased cardiovascular risk of diabetic patients. The underlying pathophysiology is only partially understood. Alterations of insulin sensitive pathways, increased concentrations of free fatty acids and low grade inflammation all play a role and result in an overproduction and decreased catabolism of triglyceride rich lipoproteins of intestinal and hepatic origin. The observed changes in HDL and LDL are mostly sequence to this. Lifestyle modification and glucose control may improve the lipid profile but statin therapy mediates the biggest benefit with respect to cardiovascular risk reduction. Therefore most diabetic patients should receive statin therapy. The role of other lipid lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, niacin and bile acid sequestrants is less well defined as they are characterized by largely negative outcome trials. This review examines the pathophysiology of diabetic dyslipidemia and its relationship to cardiovascular diseases. Management approaches will also be discussed.",

Atorvastatin supplementation prevented these changes and resulted in an increase in autophagy as indicated by a decrease in autophagy flux marker P62. In the ischemic myocardium, atorvastatin had the opposite effect, with a decrease in autophagy flux as indicated by an increase in p62 and an accumulation of light chain 3B-I, light chain B-II, and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2.", 
    "214": "Atorvastatin administration has differential effects on autophagy in ischemic and nonischemic myocardia. In the setting of metabolic syndrome, atorvastatin stimulates autophagy in nonischemic myocardium while partly inhibiting autophagy in ischemic myocardium. The differential regulation on autophagy may, in part, explain the cardioprotective effect of statins in both ischemic and nonischemic myocardia, and these findings may have implications in the setting of cardiac surgery.",

The treatment groups did not differ significantly in change from baseline of percent atheroma volume (PAV) or total atheroma volume (TAV) on intravascular ultrasound, nor in safety or clinical outcomes.", 
    "218": "Compared with men (n = 765), women (n = 274) were older (p < 0.001) and more likely to have hypertension (p < 0.001), diabetes (p = 0.002), and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p = 0.01), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.004) levels. At follow-up, women had higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001) and CRP (p < 0.001), but similar LDL-C (p = 0.46) levels compared with men. Compared with men, women had lower baseline PAV (34.0 \u00b1 8.0% vs. 37.2 \u00b1 8.2%, p < 0.001) and TAV (122.4 \u00b1 55 mm(3) vs. 151.9 \u00b1 63 mm(3), p < 0.001), yet demonstrated greater PAV regression (-1.52 \u00b1 0.18% vs. -1.07 \u00b1 0.10%, p = 0.03) and TAV regression (-8.27 \u00b1 0.9 mm(3) vs. -6.59 \u00b1 0.50 mm(3), p = 0.11) following treatment. Greater PAV regression in women versus men occurred with rosuvastatin (p = 0.004), those with diabetes (p = 0.01), stable coronary disease (p = 0.01), higher baseline LDL-C (p = 0.02), and higher CRP (p = 0.04) levels. On multivariable analysis, female sex was independently associated with PAV regression (p = 0.01), and a sex-treatment interaction was found (p = 0.036). For participants with on-treatment LDL-C levels <70 mg/dl, women achieved greater PAV regression (-1.81 \u00b1 0.22% vs. -1.12 \u00b1 0.13%, p = 0.007) and TAV regression (-10.1 \u00b1 1.1 mm(3) vs. -7.16 \u00b1 0.65 mm(3), p = 0.023) than men, whereas PAV and TAV regression did not differ by sex, with LDL-C levels \u226570 mg/dl.",

    "220": "It is well accepted that \u03b21 integrin plays a key role in maintaining normal podocytes form and functions; however, its mechanism of the potential protective effect remains unclear. Furthermore, the investigation and understanding of the non-lipid-dependent renal protection of Statins in addition to well-known lipid-lowering effect may provide the therapeutic utility and ultimately improve clinical outcome for patients with renal diseases. In the present study, we investigated the effect and mechanism of fluvastatin (FLV) on the expression of \u03b21 integrin in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-treated podocytes in vitro. Cultured human podocytes were treated with PAN, and/or different concentrations of FLV (1 \u00d7 10(-8)-1 \u00d7 10(-5 )mol/l), superoxide dismutase (SOD), or H2O2, respectively. The expression of \u03b21 integrin and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human podocytes under each experimental condition was evaluated by western blot, RT-PCR, and 2'7'-dichlorofluorescein 3'6'-diacetate, respectively. The viability of podocytes was also assessed by MTT colorimetry in the present study. The expression of \u03b21 integrin was significantly decreased, and the synthesis of ROS was significantly increased in podocytes following either PAN or H2O2 treatment (p < 0.05). The up-regulation of \u03b21 integrin and down-regulation of ROS were also observed in PAN-treated podocytes following lower concentrations of FLV or SOD treatment (p < 0.05, respectively). The cytotoxicity data derived from MTT assay revealed that lower podocyte viability was found in the presence of higher concentrations of FLV, PAN, or H2O2. Lower concentration of FLV or SOD can protect podocytes from being impaired by PAN treatment. FLV attenuated the podocyte injury induced by PAN and increased the production of \u03b21 integrin in human podocytes in vitro. This underlying mechanism of FLV may be through inhibiting the activity of ROS in human podocytes.", 
    "221": "Obesity, metabolic syndrome (MS) and dyslipidemia are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Bariatric surgery is increasingly recognized as an effective intervention for improving each of these risk factors. There are sparse data on the long-term durability of metabolic changes associated with bariatric surgery, in particular with laparoscopic gastric banding (LGB). Our objective was to evaluate the durability of metabolic changes associated with LGB in nonmorbid obesity.",

    "223": "Forty-seven patients (45 female, mean age 43.8 years) completed four years follow-up (46 completed five years). Baseline BMI was 35.1 \u00b1 2.6. Subjects exhibited mean weight loss of 22.3 \u00b1 7.9 kg (22.9 \u00b1 7.4%) at year one and maintained this (19.8 \u00b1 10.2%) over five years. At baseline, 43% (20/47) of subjects met criteria for MS. This was reduced to 15% (7/47) at year one and remained reduced over five years (13%, 6/46) (p < 0.001). There were reductions in triglycerides (p < 0.001) and increases in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C, p < 0.001) and HDL particle concentration (p = 0.02), with a trend toward increased HDL particle size (p = 0.06) at year five. Changes in triglycerides and HDL-C were more prominent in patients with MS at baseline, but unassociated with weight loss or waist circumference. Changes in HDL particle size and concentration were not associated with MS status, weight loss, waist circumference, or statin use.",
