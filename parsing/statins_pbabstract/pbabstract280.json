The recent studies were devoted to the phenomenon of modification of atherosclerosis development by statins. The aim of the study was evaluation of three statins: simvastatin, atorvastatin and pravastatin on plasma lipidogram and fluidity of erythrocytes membranes in patients (pts) with hyperlipidemia (hlp) type II.", 
    "1": "the study comprised 114 pts, including 94 pts with hlp type II without concomitant chronic diseases and 20 healthy volunteers. Pts were qualified to treatment with statins if their LDL-cholesterol concentration (LDL-C) was above 170 mg/dL (4,1 mmol/L), total cholesterol (TC) > 250 mg/dL (6,5 mmol/L) and triglicerydes (TG) < 400 mg/dL (4,5 mmol/L). Pts were randomised to three groups: group I-n = 31 pts treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/d); group Il-n = 31 with simvastatin (20 mg/d), group III-n = 32 with pravastatin (20 mg/d).", 
    "2": "after 4 and 12 weeks of active treatment the following parameters were determined: TC, HDL-C, TG (by enzymatic method using BioMerieux tests); LDL-C was calculated from the Friedewald formula and erythrocyte membranes fluidity by electron paramagnetic resonance with two spin labels (5-DSA, 16-DSA).", 
    "3": "During statin therapy significant decrease of TC, LDL-C, TG was observed, both after 4 and 12 weeks, as compared with initial values. All statins after 4 weeks of therapy caused a significant increase of membrane fluidity in its surface layer at carbon 5 depth. The values of parameter S after 12 weeks did not differ significantly from the values in the control group. The percent decrease of membrane microviscosity at carbon 5 depth did not correlate significantly with percent changes plasma TC and LDL-C. Atorvastatin appeared to be the strongest drug liquidizing erythrocytes membranes. There were no significant changes in fluidity of membrane in its deeper layers (at carbon 16 level).", 
    "4": "Statins therapy was beneficial not only for modification of plasma lipids but caused the increase of erythrocytes membrane fluidity in the surface layer.", 
    "5": "A specific and accurate reversed-phase HPLC with UV detection was developed for the assay of atorvastatin in beagle dog plasma. Indomethacin was used as the internal standard. Atorvastatin was extracted by protein precipitation, the extracts were injected into a Kromasil C8 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) with UV wavelength set at 270 nm. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile:0.1 mol/L ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) (65:35% v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The column was at ambient temperature (25 degrees C). The injection volume was 25 microl. The blank plasma did not interfere with the determination of atorvastatin and indomethacin. A good linear relationship was obtained between the peak area ratio of atorvastatin to indomethacin and the concentration of atorvastatin over the range of 0.05 to 2.5 microg/mL. The limit of quantification was 25 ng/mL, the limit of detection was 8 ng/ml. The total chromatographic analysis time was within 9 min. The method is accurate, precise and fast for the assay of atorvastatin in plasma following oral administration of an atorvastatin SMEDDS to healthy beagle dogs.", 
    "6": "Statin-mediated lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is regarded as the foundation of lipid-modifying therapy. However, the residual cardiovascular risk for statin-treated patients remains high, indicating the need for therapeutic intervention against other lipid targets as well as non-lipid risk factors. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are established as a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Intervention studies have also demonstrated clinical benefits associated with HDL-C raising. Although lifestyle modification does play an important role in raising HDL-C, most patients with a low HDL-C and at high risk of coronary events also require pharmacological treatment to achieve the target. Of the available treatment options, nicotinic acid is the most potent agent for raising HDL-C (by 26% at clinically recommended doses), while substantially lowering triglycerides and LDL-C. The addition of nicotinic acid to primary statin therapy is a logical approach to dyslipidaemia management, given their complementary mechanism of action, and is supported by recent clinical trials such as the Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing cholesterol (ARBITER) 2 study. Raising HDL-C will increasingly become an important secondary focus of dyslipidaemia management.",

    "8": "The Pr\u00e9diction du Risque Musculaire en Observationnel (Prediction of Muscular Risk in Observational conditions, PRIMO) survey was an observational study of muscular symptoms in an unselected population of 7924 hyperlipidemic patients receiving high-dosage statin therapy in a usual care, outpatient setting in France. Information on patient demographics, treatment history and muscular symptoms was obtained by questionnaires.", 
    "9": "Multivariate analysis revealed the strongest predictors for muscular symptoms to be a personal history of muscle pain during lipid-lowering therapy (odds ratio, OR, 10.12, 95% CI 8.23-12.45; P < 0.0001), unexplained cramps (OR 4.14; 95% CI 3.46-4.95; P < 0.0001) and a history of creatine kinase (CK) elevation (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.55-2.68; P < 0.0001). Overall, muscular symptoms were reported by 832 patients (10.5%), with a median time of onset of 1 month following initiation of statin therapy. Muscular pain prevented even moderate exertion during everyday activities in 315 patients (38%), while 31 (4%) were confined to bed or unable to work. Fluvastatin XL was associated with the lowest rate of muscular symptoms (5.1%) among individual statins.", 
    "10": "PRIMO demonstrated that mild to moderate muscular symptoms with high-dosage statin therapy may be more common and exert a greater impact on everyday lives than previously thought. Knowledge of the risk factors for muscular symptoms will allow identification and improved management of high-risk patients. The risk of muscular symptoms with fluvastatin XL treatment may be lower than with high dosages of other statins.", 
    "11": "Although cholesterol is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), compared with other cellular membranes, ER membrane has low cholesterol (3-6%). Most of the molecular machinery that regulates cellular cholesterol homeostasis also resides in the ER. Little is known about how cholesterol itself affects the ER membrane. Here, we demonstrate that acute cholesterol depletion in ER membranes impairs ER-to-Golgi transport of secretory membrane proteins. Cholesterol depletion is achieved by a brief inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with statins in cells grown in cholesterol-depleted medium. We provide evidence that secretory membrane proteins vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein and scavenger receptor A failed to be efficiently transported from the ER upon cholesterol depletion. Fluorescence photobleaching recovery experiments indicated that cholesterol depletion by statins leads to a severe loss of lateral mobility on the ER membrane of these transmembrane proteins, but not loss of mobility of proteins in the ER lumen. This impaired lateral mobility is correlated with impaired ER-to-Golgi transport. These results provide evidence for the first time that cholesterol is required in the ER membrane to maintain mobility of membrane proteins and thus protein secretion.", 
    "12": "Statins have been reported to confer renoprotection in several experimental models of renal disease through pleiotropic actions. The roles of statins in glomerular podocytes have not been explored. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of fluvastatin on podocyte and tubulointerstitial injury in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrosis. PAN induced massive proteinuria and serum creatinine elevation on day 7, which were significantly suppressed by fluvastatin. Immunofluorescence studies of podocyte-associated proteins nephrin and podocin revealed diminished and discontinuous staining patterns in rats with PAN nephrosis, indicating severe podocyte injury. Fluvastatin treatment dramatically mitigated the abnormal staining profiles. Reduction of nephrin expression by PAN and its reversal by fluvastatin were confirmed by quantitative analyses. By electron microscopy, effacement of foot processes was ameliorated in fluvastatin-treated rats. Fluvastatin also mitigated tubulointerstitial damage in PAN nephrosis, with the repression of PAN-induced NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 activation in the kidneys. In addition, expression of activated membrane-bound small GTPase RhoA was markedly increased in the glomeruli of PAN nephrosis, which was inhibited by fluvastatin treatment. In cultured podocytes, fluvastatin suppressed PAN-evoked activation of RhoA and actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Furthermore, fasudil, a specific Rho-kinase inhibitor, successfully ameliorated PAN-induced podocyte damage and proteinuria. In summary, fluvastatin alleviated podocyte and tubulointerstitial injury in PAN nephrosis. The beneficial effects of fluvastatin on podocytes can be attributable to direct modulation of excessive RhoA activity. Our data suggest a therapeutic role for statins in clinical conditions that are relevant to podocyte injury.", 
    "13": "The potential of microbore high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for the sensitive detection of rosuvastatin (Crestor) in human plasma was investigated. Three microbore HPLC columns with internal diameters (i.d.) of 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mm were evaluated for column efficiency and mass sensitivity, and compared to a conventional 4.6 mm i.d. column. The 2.0 and 1.0 mm i.d. columns performed very well while the 0.5 mm i.d. column was slightly less efficient, this is probably due to a lower packing density. Good results with respect to gains in mass sensitivity compared to the conventional analytical column were achieved with the 2.0 and 1.0 mm columns. Thus, the 2.0 mm i.d. column had an improved signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of 16 whilst the 1.0 mm i.d. column had an improved S/N ratio of greater than 70. Experiments with the 1.0 mm i.d. HPLC column were performed to determine the robustness of the microbore method for human plasma extracts after sample preparation using solid-phase extraction (SPE). A number of problems were encountered with extracts including high backgrounds, the blocking of the column and a rapid deterioration in column performance. The blocking of the column by particulates was solved by off-line filtration of the sample extracts. Peak tailing of the analytes and high background, both of which were due to endogenous interferences in the extracts, were eliminated using gradient elution. Using these approaches over 500 injections of plasma extracts were achieved without significant deterioration in assay performance. Quantities of rosuvastatin of 0.3 pg on-column could be detected and cross-validation experiments demonstrated that the conventional and the microbore HPLC-MS/MS methods provided similar information on the concentration of rosuvastatin but with greatly reduced sample consumption using the microbore method.", 
    "14": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) has been associated with risk factors for atherosclerosis. Medications used for atherosclerosis have also been implicated in ED. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship of erectile function to cardiovascular risk factors and specific drug therapies before and after 6 months of statin therapy. In this prospective observational study, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores were measured in 93 men attending cardiovascular risk clinics. Cardiovascular risk factors and drug therapies were assessed prior to initiation and after 6 months of statin therapy. Prior to statin therapy, the median IIEF score was 21 (range 0-25), and 57% had impairment of erectile function. After statin therapy, IIEF scores were reduced to 6.5 (range 0-25) (p < 0.001), and 22% experienced new onset ED. Before statin therapy no correlation was observed between IIEF score and any individual cardiovascular risk factor. After 6 months of statin therapy, correlations were observed between lower IIEF scores (r = 0.62; p < 0.001) and age and diabetes and weakly with smoking. Differences in dose, relative efficacy or relative lipophilicity of statin prescribed showed no correlation with change in IIEF score. This study suggests ED following statin therapy is more likely in patients with severe endothelial dysfunction due to established cardiovascular risk factors including age, smoking and diabetes.", 
    "15": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in patients with hyperlipidaemia and those with coronary artery disease. However, evidence for statin treatment in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) remains a subject of debate. Patients with heart failure were generally excluded in the existing trials and a different patient population with a distinct pattern of morbidity and treatment was studied. In addition, no safety data are available for statins in patients with heart failure, where there are potential concerns about coenzyme Q10 depletion and excessive low-density lipoprotein reduction. This review summarises the clinical and preclinical evidence for potential beneficial effects of statins in CHF. In experimental systems, statins have been shown to improve cardiac function through antioxidative and anti-inflammatory action. Statins improve endothelial function, may reduce neurohormonal activation, and stimulate endothelial progenitor cells. Some of these effects occur independently of cholesterol lowering and can be explained by inhibition of isoprenylation of signal transducing proteins of the family of Rho guanosine triphosphatases. Two ongoing controlled randomised trials (CORONA [Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Study in Heart Failure] and GISSI-HF [Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico--Heart Failure]) will help us to assess whether the described beneficial effects of statins in heart failure outweigh the potential negative effects and translate into the reduction of clinical endpoints.", 
    "16": "The pharmacologic management of the patient post myocardial infarction (MI) aims to achieve several goals. Chief among these is to prevent subsequent events, which include death, reinfarction, and rehospitalization. Secondary goals include preventing arrhythmias, minimizing left ventricular (LV) remodeling, and preventing progression to heart failure. This review describes practical algorithms for use in the pharmacologic management of the patient post MI based on American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines. The intensity of drug treatment is determined guided by the degree of LV dysfunction and the presence or absence of ischemia and arrhythmic risk markers. All patients post MI require an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and antiplatelet therapy, usually with aspirin. In individuals who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is an adequate substitute. Numerous studies document the efficacy of ACE inhibitors, which decrease mortality and the risk of heart failure and stroke. Aldosterone blockade is recommended long-term for patients post MI with an LV ejection fraction < or = 40% and either symptomatic heart failure or diabetes. Use of a beta blocker is an important addition to most post-MI drug regimens. Beta blockers decrease mortality and are especially effective in patients with impaired LV function. Among the beta blockers, carvedilol, which also has alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking activity, was found to decrease mortality significantly in patients with low ejection fractions and heart failure. Another drug therapy of value in post-MI treatment is use of calcium-channel blockers. These are restricted to patients with conserved LV function in whom congestion is absent and in whom beta blockers are contraindicated. Current guidelines also recommend that patients post MI with elevated cholesterol levels should be prescribed lipid therapy with a statin at hospital discharge.", 
    "17": "Current guidelines define the standard of care for patients after myocardial infarction (MI), with particular focus on patients with significant ventricular dysfunction. Inherent in these recommendations are assumptions about the relative risks and benefits, as well as the costs, of the available options. This review will consider strategies to prevent sudden death and heart failure post-MI by utilization of pharmacologic therapies--angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), aldosterone antagonists, statins, and beta-blockers--in parallel with the approaches reviewed elsewhere in this supplement. A patient-centric approach necessitates that drugs in each class be compared for efficacy within this patient population. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of several drugs, such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, in patients post-MI, yet these benefits do not seem to be reflected in the epidemiologic data. This may reflect underutilization of these therapies or, alternatively, support the notion that efficacy in clinical trials does not assure effectiveness in clinical practice. The latter point is a subject of ongoing investigation, while the former is being addressed through quality-of-care initiatives. In clinical practice, aggressiveness is key, starting with patient education. If patients understand their risks better, compliance and adoption of a more ideal lifestyle seem more likely. However, even with educational programs, human nature teaches us that marked change in behavior is difficult and therefore, to minimize risks, particularly of sudden death and heart failure post infarction, an optimized pharmacologic regimen serves as a powerful tool.", 
    "18": "Early hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) trials provided the first evidence of the benefits of statin therapy in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). Outcomes data from more recent trials involving atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin, have since expanded the patient population shown to benefit from statin therapy. Current studies are evaluating the benefits of lowering lipid levels with statins to below current goals, as well as examining benefits in special patient populations and evaluating the value of surrogate markers of CHD. Early trials provided a solid foundation of knowledge on the efficacy and safety of statins. Recent and ongoing trials generate new data to resolve remaining questions in the fields of CHD prevention and lipidology.", 
    "19": "Human malignant mesothelioma (HMM) is resistant to many anticancer drugs, including doxorubicin. Mevastatin and simvastatin, 2 inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase, potentiated the intracellular accumulation and the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin in HMM cells constitutively expressing P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein 3. This effect of statins was nitric oxide (NO)-dependent, since it was reverted by either an NO synthase inhibitor or an NO scavenging system. The NO synthase up-regulation in HMM and other cells is known to be associated with the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB: in HMM cells statins increased the NF-kappaB translocation into the nucleus, decreased the level of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkBalpha and increased the phosphorylation/activation of IkB kinase alpha (IKKalpha). IKKalpha is under the negative control exerted by RhoA in its prenylated (active) form: incubation of HMM cells with statins lowered the amount of active RhoA and the level of Rho-associated kinase activity. All statins' effects were reverted by mevalonic acid, thus suggesting that they were mediated by the inhibition of HMGCoA reductase and were likely to be subsequent to the reduced availability of precursor molecules for RhoA prenylation. Both the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 and the RhoA inhibitor toxin B (from Clostridium difficile) mimicked the statins' effects, enhancing doxorubicin accumulation, NO synthesis and IKKalpha phosphorylation and decreasing the amount of IkBalpha in HMM cells. Simvastatin, Y27632 and toxin B elicited tyrosine nitration in the P-glycoprotein, thus providing a likely mechanism by which NO reverts the doxorubicin resistance in HMM cells.",

    "25": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of mortality in the United States, and is associated with significant health care costs. Current evidence overwhelmingly confirms the role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and the risk of CHD events. The approach to the management of hyperlipidemia has evolved dramatically over the past decade. Randomized clinical trails have provided strong evidence that lowering plasma cholesterol with statins reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, particularly in high-risk patients, irrespective of baseline cholesterol levels. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) report was released in July 2004. The report examined the results of recently concluded clinical trials and provided consensus recommendations on the management of hyperlipidemia. The report expands on the core content of the previously published guidelines. However, it is by far the most aggressive approach to date for reducing CHD risk. A focal element of the report is the modification of LDL-C goal in high-risk patients to <70 mg/dL. This goal is provided as a therapeutic option and is based on findings of recently concluded clinical trials. The more aggressive recommendations add challenges to the health care system, as the number of patients requiring drug therapy is likely to increase. In spite of the challenges, there are ample opportunities for improving the management of hyperlipidemia. Adherence to the recommendations will vastly reduce morbidity and mortality associated with CHD.",

Antiplatelet and statin therapies were used significantly less in women than in men, both at initial assessment and at 1 year, even in those in whom coronary disease had been confirmed. Women with confirmed coronary disease were less likely to be revascularized than their male counterparts and were twice as likely to suffer death or nonfatal myocardial infarction during the 1-year follow-up period (hazard ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.13 to 3.85), even after multivariable adjustment for age, abnormal ventricular function, severity of coronary disease, and diabetes.",

However, striking effects observed in experimental models support the concept that atherosclerosis can regress. This is often accompanied by changes in plaque composition favouring stability and decreased likelihood of rupture. Large clinical trials have established the value of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with statin treatment, although this may prevent no more than 30% of all cardiovascular events, and the magnitude of effect on plaque regression seems relatively modest. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is well recognised as an important and independent protective factor, although treatment options to increase HDL-C have until now been limited. The recent emergence of new treatments will probably establish increased HDL-C as another important strategy in antiatherosclerosis treatment. Beyond HDL-C increases, further appreciation of mechanisms of cellular lipid homoeostasis and regulation of gene transcription have revealed new targets for atherosclerosis treatment. This review considers emerging approaches to plaque regression together with some of the parallel developments in imaging technology that will improve our appreciation of response to treatment.",

We found that pretreatment with simvastatin significantly inhibited HG- and ANG II-induced collagen IV production, JAK2 activation, and phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in GMC. We also found that the activation of JAK2 by HG and ANG II was dependent on the Rho family of GTPases. Consistent with these in vitro results, both albumin protein excretion and phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT1, and STAT3 were attenuated in renal glomeruli by administration of simvastatin in a streptozotocin-induced rat model of HG diabetes.

    "50": "Fluvastatin, but not pravastatin, induced apoptosis in RA synoviocytes in a concentration-dependent (1-10 microM) and time-dependent (48-96 hours) manner. Another lipophilic statin, pitavastatin, displayed almost the same effects as fluvastatin. In sharp contrast, lipophilic statins did not significantly increase apoptosis in synoviocytes from patients with osteoarthropathy. Apoptosis induced by fluvastatin was mitochondrial- and caspase 3-dependent and was abrogated by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by farnesyl pyrophosphate. In addition, the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-298 mimicked the effect of fluvastatin on RA synoviocytes. Treatment of RA synoviocytes with the RhoA kinase inhibitor Y-27632 caused apoptosis. Fluvastatin decreased the amount of RhoA protein in the membrane fraction, but increased the amount in the cytosolic fraction.", 
    "51": "Fluvastatin induced apoptosis in RA synoviocytes through a mitochondrial- and caspase 3-dependent pathway and by the blockage of mevalonate pathways, particularly through the inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation and RhoA/RhoA kinase pathways. These findings suggest that lipophilic statins have potential as novel therapeutic agents for RA.", 
    "52": "Dermatomyositis is a rare inflammatory dermatosis for which an iatrogenic origin has been described in very few cases. We report a case of dermatomyositis occurring after fluvastatin intake.", 
    "53": "A 76-year-old male patient sought medical attention for a photodistributed rash and considerable muscular weakness present for one month. Two months earlier, fluvastatin had been introduced following the discovery of dyslipidemia. Serum creatine phosphokinase levels were elevated. Histological examination of a muscle biopsy was consistent with a diagnosis of dermatomyositis. Investigation for neoplasia and associated autoimmune disease proved negative. All clinical and laboratory abnormalities diminished spontaneously without recourse to corticosteroids within one month of the final intake of fluvastatin. After a follow-up period of three years, no recurrence was observed and no signs of neoplasia or connectivitis were found.", 
    "54": "Iatrogenic dermatomyositis has only been reported in rare cases. Certain drugs have been incriminated, notably D-penicillamine. Six cases of drug-induced dermatomyositis have been described with statins: simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin and lovastatin. Of these cases, only one resolved spontaneously after withdrawal of the drug alone without use of corticosteroids. Our case concerns intake of fluvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with rare though well-known muscular side effects: elevated serum CPK, myalgia and rhabdomyolysis. Six cases of polymyositis have also been reported. Ours is the first case of dermatomyositis described with this category of statins. It is also the second reported case showing improvement after withdrawal of the lipid-lowering agent and without corticosteroids. Thus in cases of dermatomyositis, this iatrogenic picture should be sought routinely.", 
    "55": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a genetic syndrome caused by mutations in the 3beta-hydroxysterol Delta(7)-reductase gene (DHCR7). SLOS patients have decreased cholesterol and increased 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) levels. Dietary cholesterol supplementation improves systemic biochemical abnormalities; however, because of the blood-brain barrier, the central nervous system (CNS) is not treated. Simvastatin therapy has been proposed as a means to treat the CNS. Mice homozygous for a null disruption of Dhcr7, Dhcr7(Delta3-5/Delta3-5), die soon after birth, thus they cannot be used to study postnatal development or therapy. To circumvent this problem, we produced a hypomorphic SLOS mouse model by introducing a mutation corresponding to DHCR7(T93M). Both Dhcr7(T93M/T93M) and Dhcr7(Delta3-5/T93M) mice are viable. Phenotypic findings in Dhcr7(T93M/Delta3-5) mice include CNS ventricular dilatation and two to three syndactyly. Biochemically, both Dhcr7(T93M/T93M) and Dhcr7(T93M/Delta3-5) mice have elevated tissue 7-DHC levels; however, the biochemical defect improved with age. This has not been observed in human patients, and is due to elevated Dhcr7 expression in mouse tissues. Dietary cholesterol therapy improved sterol profiles in peripheral, but not CNS tissues. However, treatment of Dhcr7(T93M/Delta3-5) mice with simvastatin decreased 7-DHC levels in both peripheral and brain tissues. Expression of Dhcr7 increased in Dhcr7(T93M/Delta3-5) tissues after simvastatin therapy, consistent with the hypothesis that simvastatin therapy improves the biochemical phenotype by increasing the expression of a Dhcr7 allele with residual enzymatic activity. We conclude that simvastatin treatment is efficacious in improving the SLOS-associated sterol abnormality found in the brain, and thus has the potential to be an effective therapeutic intervention for behavioral and learning problems associated with SLOS.", 
    "56": "Statin treatment promotes survival after cardiac transplantation by reducing cholesterol levels, allograft rejection, and transplant coronary artery disease. Analysis of data from 114 heart transplant recipients (including 86 treated with statins for < or =1 year post-transplantation) revealed that statins were associated with shortened corrected QT intervals (QTc), reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduced transplant coronary artery disease incidence at 1 year and improved survival at 5 years. Statin-associated QTc shortening thus appears to be a favorable prognostic sign after transplantation.", 
    "57": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of bile acid synthesis, caused by impaired hydroxylation of cholesterol side chains due to deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), leading to accumulation of cholestanol and cholesterol in brain and other tissues. Elevated plasma cholestanol serves as a key marker for the clinical diagnosis of CTX. In the present report we describe a young man with CTX who was on high dose steroids for a misdiagnosed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and had normal level of serum cholestanol. When steroids were discontinued, markedly elevated serum cholestanol was measured concomitant with marked clinical worsening. This observation may imply that steroids can lower plasma cholestanol, possibly by directly inducing residual CYP27A1 activity or by inducing alternative pathways for cholestanol elimination.", 
    "58": "C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, was linked to coronary heart disease (CHD) in the Reykjavik study cohort. Recent genetic studies have shown that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele is associated with lower CRP levels. Statin treatment has also been shown to lower CRP levels. In the Age Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study, we examined the association of APOE genotypes with CRP accounting for the effect of statin treatment, previous CHD and a mid-life measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), an inflammatory marker associated with risk in this cohort.", 
    "59": "The first 2296 participants (mean age 76+/-6 years, 42% men) in the AGES-Reykjavik Study were genotyped for APOE CRP concentration was measured with a high sensitivity method. A general linear model was used to evaluate the association of APOE genotype to CRP levels. The frequencies of the APOE alleles are epsilon2=0.06, epsilon3=0.78 and epsilon4=0.16. CRP levels ranged from 0.2 to 56.6 mg/L, median 1.9 mg/L. Participants carrying one or two epsilon4 alleles have significantly lower CRP levels than non-carriers and this effect was observed in a dose-dependent manner. This trend is the same in users and non-users of statin treatment.", 
    "60": "This study suggests that the contribution of the epsilon4 allele towards lowering CRP levels is independent and may be by a different mechanism than how statins affect inflammation.", 
    "61": "Elevated plasma concentrations of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are found in various clinical settings, including renal failure, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and pre-eclampsia. In healthy people acute infusion of ADMA promotes vascular dysfunction, and in mice chronic infusion of ADMA promotes progression of atherosclerosis. Thus, ADMA may not only be a marker but also an active player in cardiovascular disease, which makes it a potential target for therapeutic interventions. This review provides a summary and critical discussion of the presently available data concerning the effects on plasma ADMA levels of cardiovascular drugs, hypoglycemic agents, hormone replacement therapy, antioxidants, and vitamin supplementation. We assess the evidence that the beneficial effects of drug therapies on vascular function can be attributed to modification of ADMA levels. To develop more specific ADMA-lowering therapies, mechanisms leading to elevation of plasma ADMA concentrations in cardiovascular disease need to be better understood. ADMA is formed endogenously by degradation of proteins containing arginine residues that have been methylated by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases (PRMTs). There are two major routes of elimination: renal excretion and enzymatic degradation by the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAH-1 and -2). Oxidative stress causing upregulation of PRMT expression and/or attenuation of DDAH activity has been suggested as a mechanism and possible drug target in clinical conditions associated with elevation of ADMA. As impairment of DDAH activity or capacity is associated with substantial increases in plasma ADMA concentrations, DDAH is likely to emerge as a prime target for specific therapeutic interventions.", 
    "62": "Atheromatous embolization is a multisystem disease complicating advanced atherosclerosis. It occurs most often as a complication of angiography, an endovascular procedure or cardiovascular surgery. Atheromatous embolization can present in a subtle manner where it is often under-recognized, or with catastrophic results including myocardial infarction, strake or acute renal failure. It may mimic other disease processes and often goes underdiagnosed and undertreated. A high clinical suspicion is the key to diagnosis. Atheromatous embolization results in significant morbidity and mortality; therefore, early recognition followed by aggressive management may help to prevent end-organ damage and improve overall clinical outcomes. Management strategies should include risk factor modification, prevention of further insults by discontinuing or avoiding predisposing factors, supportive treatment and interventional or surgical approaches to remove the atheroembolic source. Atheromatous embolization is expected to increase as our population ages and the epidemics of diabetes mellitus and obesity increase.", 
    "63": "Hyperlipidaemia is a well-established risk factor of the progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). Statins such as atorvastatin, as lipid-lowering agents, can not only normalise serum lipid levels, but also may improve endothelial function, reduce vascular inflammation and enhance plaque stability.", 
    "64": "To evaluate the efficacy of a low-dose atorvastatin regimen (10 mg daily) in patients with CAD.", 
    "65": "Seventy-nine patients with stable angina of II or III functional class and angiographically significant stenosis of coronary arteries (>70%) entered a 12-week treatment period with atorvastatin 10 mg/day. Lipid profile, which included total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) were assessed at baseline and after treatment at week 12. In addition, flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and nitrate-induced dilation (NID) of the brachial artery were measured before and after treatment.", 
    "66": "Among 79 patients included in the study, in 54 (68%) the target TC value <5.0 mmol/l, and in 51 (65%) the LDL-C level <3.0 mmol/l were achieved. Atorvastatin decreased TC level by 31% (p<0.01), LDL-C level by 35% (p<0.01), TG level by 23% (p<0.01) and increased HDL-C level by 8% (p<0.01). FMD was increased by 61 % (p<0.01) and normalised in 88% of patients after 3-month therapy of atorvastatin. NID was increased by 16% (p<0.05).", 
    "67": "Low-dose treatment with atorvastatin (10 mg daily) is effective in reducing blood lipids and is associated with the improvement of endothelial function in patients with CAD.", 
    "68": "The present study has been designed to investigate the effect of fasudil (Rho-kinase inhibitor) in diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperhomocyteinemia (HHcy) induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED). Streptozotocin (55 mg kg(-1), i.v., once only) and methionine (1.7% w/w, p.o., daily for 4 weeks) were administered to rats to produce DM (serum glucose >140 mg dl(-1)) and HHcy (serum homocysteine >10 microM) respectively. VED was assessed using isolated aortic ring, electron microscopy of thoracic aorta, and serum concentration of nitrite/nitrate. Serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration was estimated to assess oxidative stress. Atorvastatin has been employed in the present study as standard agent to improve vascular endothelial dysfunction. Fasudil (15 mg kg(-1) and 30 mg kg(-1), p.o., daily) and atorvastatin (30 mg kg(-1), p.o., daily) treatments significantly attenuated increase in serum glucose and homocysteine but their concentrations remained markedly higher than sham control value. Fasudil and atorvastatin treatments markedly prevented DM and HHcy-induced (i) attenuation of acetylcholine induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, (ii) impairment of vascular endothelial lining, (iii) decrease in serum nitrite/nitrate concentration, and (iv) increase in serum TBARS. It may be concluded that fasudil prevented DM and HHcy-induced VED partially by decreasing serum glucose and homocysteine concentration due to inhibition of Rho-kinase. Moreover, inhibition of Rho-kinase by fasudil and consequent prevention of oxidative stress may have directly improved VED in diabetic and hyperhomocysteinemic rats. The Rho-kinase appears to be a pivotal target site involved in DM and HHcy-induced VED.", 
    "69": "Some studies have suggested that lipid lowering with statins exerts favorable effects on the progression of chronic kidney disease. Therefore, the authors assessed the effects of short-term atorvastatin treatment on biochemical markers of renal function and evaluated duplex indices of renal blood flow (RBF) in patients with peripheral arterial disease. Hyperlipidemic claudicants (n = 18), aged 44-85 years, were treated for 8 weeks with 20 mg/day atorvastatin. Blood tests at baseline and after 8 weeks included serum fasting lipids, creatinine, urate, and cystatin C (a sensitive indicator of renal function) levels. RBF was also assessed (n = 9) by measuring pulsatile and resistance duplex indices. As expected, there was a significant improvement in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. There was also a significant (p < 0.0001) fall in serum creatinine from 89 (58-125) to 79 micromol/L (54-119) and an increase in calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) from 72 (40-129) to 80 mL/minute (47-138; p < 0.0001). Serum cystatin C values decreased significantly (p = 0.0002) from 1.04 (0.57-1.56) to 0.90 mg/L (0.47-1.47). There were no detectable changes in the RBF duplex indices. Treatment of stable claudicants with atorvastatin for 8 weeks was associated with improved renal function (as assessed by serum creatinine, cystatin C, and calculated CrCl) without changes in RBF. Further studies are required to identify the mechanisms involved in this phenomenon.", 
    "70": "The evidence has indicated that rapid reduction of inflammatory marker, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) could be achieved by administration of a statin. However, limited information is available in evaluating the short-term time course of CRP reduction in patients with coronary artery disease by use of a statin. Forty-two patients with stable angina were randomly assigned to 20 mg/d or 40 mg/d group of pravastatin. Blood samples were drawn at days 0, 1, and 14 for measuring lipid profile, CRP levels, and hepatic enzymes in all patients. The results showed that both doses of pravastatin induced significant reductions in median CRP levels and in mean CRP levels, respectively, at day 1 (20% in the 20 mg/d group and 17.6% in the 40 mg/d group; 15% in the 20 mg/d group and 10% in the 40 mg/d group) as well as at day 14 (28.6% in the 20 mg/d group and 33.3% in the 40 mg/d group; 25% in the 20 mg/d group and 22.8% in the 40 mg/d group) compared with baseline data without a dose-dependent manner. In addition, no changes were found at day 1 regarding lipid profile; however, both doses of pravastatin induced significant reductions in total cholesterol (TC, 22% and 30%), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (30% and 40%) compared with baseline at 14 days. The higher dose of pravastatin resulted in significantly greater reductions in TC and LDL cholesterol compared with the 20 mg/d dose (p = 0.05, p = 0.01, respectively). A less significant reduction was observed in triglycerides level (16% and 24%) compared with TC and LDL cholesterol. There was no significant difference in mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels compared with baseline in both groups. These data suggested that a common daily dose of pravastatin resulted in rapid reduction of CRP within 24 hours and of lipid profile within 2 weeks, and the benefit to the vascular endothelium might occur quickly by reduction of CRP levels, which may be clinically important for patients in a high-risk subgroup, such as acute coronary artery disease.", 
    "71": "Statins may have favorable effects on endothelial barrier function, possibly through reduction of oxidative stress and modulation of expression of vasoactive proteins. The permeability of human umbilical endothelial cells in culture to a group of fluorescein isothiocyanate dextrans of different molecular weights were studied under various experimental conditions. Superoxide anion production was measured with an ethidium bromide fluorescence method. Cellular endothelin 1 mRNA and endothelin 1 in culture media were measured with Northern blots and enzyme immunoassays, respectively. Rosuvastatin (10 nmol/l) normalized the 500 mg/dl dextrose-induced permeability changes. Superoxide anion production induced by 500 mg/dl dextrose was inhibited by therapeutic concentrations of rosuvastatin or simvastatin (10 nmol/l), whereas the increased levels of cellular endothelin 1 mRNA and endothelin 1 in culture media was inhibited by supratherapeutic concentrations of statins (> or =0.1 micromol/l). In conclusion, 1) endothelial cell barrier dysfunction occurs in cells treated with high concentrations of dextrose, 2) statin treatment of endothelial cells normalizes barrier permeability, and 3) the favorable effects of statins may be attributed to the inhibition of the dextrose-induced increase in superoxide anions, whereas inhibition of endothelin expression was observed only at supratherapeutic concentrations.", 
    "72": "In addition to lipid lowering effects, statins appear to have pleiotropic immunomodulatory properties. As they particularly affect monocyte functions, we tested the influence of statin treatment on the monocyte activating toll-like receptors (TLR) 4 and 2 in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in vivo. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 healthy, male subjects were randomized to receive either simvastatin (80 mg/day) or placebo for 4 days before intravenous LPS administration (20 IU/kg). Simvastatin did not influence the increase in TLR transcripts after LPS administration measured in mRNA isolated from whole blood by quantitative RT-PCR. In contrast, the parallel upregulation of TLR4 and TLR2 on the surface of monocytes determined by flow cytometry was attenuated by more than half after LPS challenge (P<0.02). Suppressed TLR4 and TLR2 expression was associated with diminished circulating concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In conclusion, high-dose simvastatin pretreatment blunted TLR4 and TLR2 expression on monocytes in a human endotoxemia model on a posttranscriptional level. This suppressive effect of statins on key receptors of the innate immunity which was associated with a reduction of effector cytokines reveals a potential mechanism for their beneficial effects in sepsis and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "73": "The most important action of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) is their ability to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Statins have proved highly effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in both primary and secondary prevention studies. However, the magnitude of risk reduction associated with statins is greater than that predicted on the basis of LDL cholesterol lowering alone. A likely explanation for this effect is the anti-inflammatory action of statins. Following the observation that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular events, investigators in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) and Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) trials demonstrated that the magnitude of risk reduction associated with statin therapy was higher among those with elevated hs-CRP levels. In addition, there is accumulating evidence that statins lower plasma levels of hs-CRP in a manner largely independent of LDL cholesterol lowering. In contrast, little benefit has been demonstrated for statin therapy in the absence of both hyperlipidemia and inflammation. Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) is a large multinational, long-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial designed to assess directly whether statin therapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg/day) should be given to apparently healthy individuals with low LDL cholesterol levels but elevated hs-CRP levels--a critical issue for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Support for the concept behind the JUPITER trial is also now available from several recent trials comparing different intensities of statin therapy on disease progression as well as clinical end points. These studies indicate that the hs-CRP level achieved after initiation of statin therapy may be as important as the LDL cholesterol level achieved. All of these data raise the possibility that hs-CRP could be used to target high-risk patients who may benefit from early statin use. Ongoing work will determine whether hs-CRP reduction, independent of LDL cholesterol reduction, results in a net clinical benefit.", 
    "74": "Inflammation is a component of the major modifiable risk factors in renal disease. Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels have been shown to predict all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients dependent on dialysis and to predict worsening renal function in subjects without overt renal disease. Levels of hs-CRP are also predictive of hypertension, a major risk factor for renal disease, across all levels of blood pressure in subjects without initial hypertension. Many of the treatments used in patients with renal disease exert anti-inflammatory activities that constitute or contribute to their therapeutic effects. A number of studies have indicated that statin therapy exerts a renoprotective effect that is possibly mediated by anti-inflammatory activities.", 
    "75": "Although moderate drinking has been associated with lower mortality among patients after myocardial infarction, its relationship with prognosis and graft obstruction among patients with coronary artery bypass grafts is unknown.", 
    "76": "We studied 1351 patients enrolled in the Post-CABG trial, who had undergone coronary bypass surgery 1 to 11 years before entry. Participants were randomly assigned to lovastatin in low or high doses and to low-dose warfarin or placebo in a factorial design. Participants underwent coronary angiography at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 4.3 years and were followed up for a composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, bypass surgery, or angioplasty. We categorized reported weekly alcohol intake as abstention (<1 drink), light (1-6 drinks), moderate (7-13 drinks), and heavier (> or =14 drinks).", 
    "77": "During follow-up, 238 participants sustained a clinical event. Moderate drinking was associated with a trend toward both fewer clinical events (hazard ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.1) and less angiographic progression (odds ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.5-1.1), although neither of these effects were statistically significant. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol appeared to account for one third of the trend toward lower risk among moderate drinkers.", 
    "78": "We did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in prognosis according to alcohol intake in this study, although there were inverse trends between moderate drinking and both morbidity and graft progression of a magnitude similar to studies in other populations. Larger studies of alcohol intake among patients with coronary artery bypass grafts are needed.",

A systematic literature search between 1980 and 2004 was conducted. Randomized placebo-controlled trials of the 3 statins, which studied cardiovascular diseases or death as the outcome, enrolled > or = 1000 participants, and had > or = 1-year follow-up, were included. Trials were grouped according to the statin under study. A pooled relative risk (RR) was derived from each set of trials using a random-effects model.

All trials had a similar degree of lipid reduction. Graphical and statistical assessments showed minimal heterogeneity in the trials' effect sizes. Adjusted indirect comparisons did not reveal a statistically significant difference between statins in reducing fatal coronary heart disease and nonfatal myocardial infarctions (simvastatin vs pravastatin: RR 0.93 [95% CI 0.84-1.03]; atorvastatin vs simvastatin: RR 0.84 [95% CI 0.66-1.08]; atorvastatin vs pravastatin: RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.61-1.02]). We were unable to detect differences either in outcomes for fatal and nonfatal strokes, all cardiovascular deaths, and all-cause mortality.",

    "83": "The objective of this study was to show that plant sterols in tablet form provide additional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering for patients on statin therapy. Dispersible phytosterol tablets were tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel clinical trial. Twenty-six patients who were following the American Heart Association Heart Healthy Diet and on long-term statin therapy were studied for 9 weeks. After 3 weeks of placebo treatment, the subjects were randomized to receive either 1.8 g of soy stanols or placebo for 6 weeks in addition to their usual statin regimen. Stanol tablets reduced LDL cholesterol 9.1% (p = 0.007) or 12.2 mg/dl. Total cholesterol was reduced by 12.9 mg/dl (p = 0.03). A strong inverse correlation (r(s) = -0.82, p = 0.0007) was found between the baseline LDL cholesterol and the percent change in LDL cholesterol observed after stanol treatment. The additional LDL cholesterol lowering with stanol/lecithin tablets provided a potential adjunctive therapy for patients who have not reached their target LDL cholesterol goal during statin therapy.",

This study compared the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin treatment for 6 weeks in hypercholesterolemic African-American adults. In the African American Rosuvastatin Investigation of Efficacy and Safety (ARIES) trial (4522US/0002), 774 adult African-Americans with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol > or = 160 and < or = 300 mg/dl and triglycerides < 400 mg/dl were randomized to receive open-label rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg or atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg for 6 weeks. At week 6, significantly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B concentrations, as well as lipoprotein and apolipoprotein ratios, were seen with rosuvastatin versus milligram-equivalent atorvastatin doses (analysis of variance with Bonferroni-adjusted critical p < 0.017 for all comparisons). Rosuvastatin 10 mg also increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin 20 mg (p < 0.017). Although statistical comparisons were not performed, larger proportions of rosuvastatin-treated patients than atorvastatin-treated patients achieved National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. The median high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were significantly reduced statistically from baseline with rosuvastatin 20 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg among all patients and with rosuvastatin 10 and 20 mg and atorvastatin 20 mg in those patients with a baseline C-reactive protein level > 2.0 mg/L. The 2 study medications were well tolerated during the 6-week study period. In conclusion, rosuvastatin 10 and 20 mg improved the overall lipid profile of hypercholesterolemic African-Americans better than did milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin.", 
    "86": "Despite the excellent benefit/risk profile of statins, their use is limited by a dose-related risk of adverse events, particularly those related to muscle toxicity. Ezetimibe/simvastatin (Vytorin) is a cholesterol-lowering therapy that inhibits the intestinal absorption (ezetimibe) and synthesis (simvastatin) of cholesterol. This analysis compared the muscle safety profiles of ezetimibe/simvastatin and simvastatin monotherapy. We reviewed muscle-related adverse event (AE) data from 17 randomized, blinded clinical trials (13 base and 4 extension studies), in which ezetimibe and simvastatin were either co-administered as separate entities or given as a combination tablet to 4,558 patients. The following AE categories were summarized: incidence of musculoskeletal or connective-tissue AEs (all and drug related); discontinuations due to musculoskeletal or connective-tissue AEs (all and drug related); incidence of AEs reported under the term \"myalgia\" (all and drug related); discontinuation due to myalgia (all and drug related); incidence of \"myopathy\" (all and drug related); increases in creatine kinase to 3 to < 5, 5 to < 10, and > or = 10 times the upper limit of normal. For all AE categories examined, the incidence of muscle-related clinical and laboratory AEs or discontinuations due to muscle-related AEs was no more common in patients taking ezetimibe/simvastatin than in those taking simvastatin alone. Thus, the clinical trial experience with ezetimibe/simvastatin suggests that ezetimibe does not enhance or aggravate the muscle effects of simvastatin.", 
    "87": "Clinical studies have shown the benefit of statin use after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, it is uncertain how this benefit relates to the timing of statin initiation after AMI. We created a retrospective cohort (from 1996 to 2001) using health care databases in Quebec, Canada, to study patients (> or =65 years of age) who had AMI and differed in time of statin initiation within the first 90 days after discharge. Rates of recurrent AMI and mortality were compared between patients who initiated statins at discharge (early group) and those who initiated statins 1 month later and up to 90 days after discharge (delayed group). A multivariate Cox's regression model was used in the comparison. We used prescription time distribution matching to control for survival difference between groups. The early and delayed groups consisted of 3,075 and 1,187 patients, respectively. During the 1-year follow-up, there was no evidence to suggest a difference in outcome between groups. Adjusted hazard ratios for early versus delayed initiation were 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.56 to 1.87) at 3 months and 1.24 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.62) at 1 year. Analyses that were restricted to first-time statin users or excluded patients who had severe co-morbidity or were > or =85 years old did not change the results. Our findings were not affected by changing the definition of delayed use within the 90-day period. In conclusion, delay of statin initiation up to 30 to 90 days after discharge after AMI does not appear to lead to a difference in the rates of recurrent AMI and mortality compared with statin initiation at discharge.", 
    "88": "It has been speculated that the use of hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) is associated with the risk of malignant diseases. Considering their immunosuppressive activities, malignant diseases that are associated with an immunosuppressive status seem feasible to examine the association. We therefore examined the association between statin use and development of lymphoid malignancies in a case-control study. Cases were 221 consecutive incident cases with histopathologically proven lymphoid malignancies (lymphoma and myeloma), hospitalized in the Department of Hematology of Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between 1995 and 2001. Two independent control groups, comprising 442 and 437 inpatients without malignancies from the Departments of Orthopedics and Otorhinolaryngology of the same hospital, were selected to test for consistency of association. Controls were matched individually with cases for age, sex and year of admission. Subject information, including statin use, was abstracted from medical records at the time of hospitalization. Strength of association was evaluated as an adjusted odds ratios (aOR) using a conditional logistic regression model. A higher frequency of statin use was found among patients with lymphoid malignancies in comparison with both orthopedic (aOR 2.11, 95% CI 1.20-3.69, P = 0.009) and otorhinolaryngology patients (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.45-4.65, P = 0.001), the significance being maintained when the two control groups were combined (aOR 2.24, 95% CI 1.37-3.66, P = 0.001). In conclusion, we observed an elevated risk of lymphoid malignancy with statin use among Japanese patients. Further evaluations in different populations are required to draw conclusions as to the carcinogenicity of lymphoid malignancies with statin use.", 
    "89": "Pleiotropic features are attributed to statins and fibrates, and effects on laboratory markers of HIV disease progression have been claimed. To assess whether statins/fibrates have long-term effects on the immune recovery of patients on virologically effective HAART, a prospective, comparative study was conducted on 267 dyslipidemic patients treated with either statins, fibrates, or on a dietary exercise programme only. Quarterly assessment of CD4 cell counts showed no differences between groups, thus excluding in-vivo negative immunological effects during effective HAART.", 
    "90": "Chronic inflammation in atherosclerosis is responsible for plaque instability through alterations in extracellular matrix. Previously, we demonstrated that major histocompatibility class II (MHC II) transactivator (CIITA) in a complex with regulatory factor for X box 5 (RFX5) is a crucial protein mediating interferon (IFN)-gamma-induced repression of collagen type I gene transcription in fibroblasts. This article demonstrates that, in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), IFN-gamma dramatically increases the expression of CIITA isoforms III and IV, with no increase in expression of CIITA isoform I. Expression of CIITA III and IV correlates with decreased collagen type I and increased MHC II gene expression. Exogenous expression of CIITA I, III, and IV, in transiently transfected SMCs, represses collagen type I promoters (COL1A1 and COL1A2) and activates MHC II promoter. Levels of CIITA and RFX5 increase in the nucleus of cells treated with IFN-gamma. Moreover, simvastatin lowers the IFN-gamma-induced expression of RFX5 and MHC II in addition to repressing collagen expression. However, simvastatin does not block the IFN-gamma-induced expression of CIITA III and IV, suggesting a CIITA-independent mechanism. This first demonstration that RFX5 and CIITA isoforms are expressed in SMCs after IFN-gamma stimulation suggest that CIITA could be a key factor in plaque stability in atherosclerosis.", 
    "91": "Lipoprotein associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) modulates low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation by hydrolysing oxidised phospholipids present on particle surfaces. We investigated whether Lp-PLA2 activity and PLA2G7 A379V genotype were related to mediators of atherosclerosis in a diabetic study. Plasma Lp-PLA2 activity (taken in men only) and A379V genotype were investigated with regards to metabolic syndrome (MS), UKPDS risk score, and oxidised LDL (oxLDL/LDL), in a cohort of Caucasian men and women (n=783, age 62.5+/-13.7 years). After adjustment for type of diabetes, CHD status, and statin use, those individuals with features defining the MS (WHO guidelines) had higher Lp-PLA2 activity (35.6+/-11.9 nmol/min/ml) compared to those without (33.0+/-10.8 nmol/min/ml) (p=0.02). Quartiles of UKPDS coronary heart disease (CHD) risk score were also positively associated with Lp-PLA2 activity (p=0.006, p=0.004 linear trend). Those men in the highest quartile of oxLDL/LDL level had the lowest Lp-PLA2 activity (31.3+/-10.5 nmol/min/ml) when compared to the middle two (32.3+/-9.8 and 35.9+/-10.9 nmol/min/ml, respectively) and lowest quartile (35.6 +/-12.5 nmol/min/ml; p=0.03, p=0.004 linear trend). There was no significant association between A379V genotype and Lp-PLA2 enzyme activity (p=0.34) or oxLDL/LDL (p=0.32). Lp-PLA2 activity is an independent predictor of CHD risk and MS in a sample of subjects with diabetes mellitus. The association of Lp-PLA2 activity with oxLDL/LDL suggests that Lp-PLA2 may be a modulating factor in the process of atherosclerosis.", 
    "92": "Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) are increasingly common conditions that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The strongest predictor of recurrent stroke risk is an initial stroke or TIA; in fact, nearly 30% of all strokes are recurrent events. It is often the emergency department (ED) physician who, while treating the initial event, has the first opportunity to initiate effective preventive strategies, including pharmacotherapy and behavior modification. Evidence- and consensus-based guidelines are well established for the use of antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants, and antihypertensives for prevention of secondary stroke. Recent evidence suggests that the use of statins may be associated with improved clinical outcomes after ischemic stroke. In addition, behavioral interventions, such as smoking cessation, exercise, diet, and stroke education, can help patients avoid stroke recurrence. By initiating prevention therapies during the acute stroke or TIA encounter, EPs convey the message to patients that these therapies are important for the prevention of recurrent events and are an essential part of the treatment.", 
    "93": "Statins are inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, a key enzyme in mevalonic acid (MVA)-dependent signaling.

The effects of both statins were dose-dependent. Moreover, both statins, and to a lesser degree lovastatin, were found to inhibit the SCF-induced differentiation of MCs from their progenitors. The other statins tested (simvastatin, pravastatin) did not affect mediator release or growth of MCs.",

    "98": "Sixty-one consecutive hypercholesterolaemic patients whose lipid profiles had been well controlled by regular simvastatin (20 mg day(-1)) treatment for more than 6 months were enrolled. Statin was discontinued after their lipid profiles reached the treatment goal of the ATP-III guideline. The lipid profiles, serum MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of MMP and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were measured on the day of simvastatin withdrawal and 120 days later. A further 50 hyperlipidaemia patients who had never received statin treatment (positive control group) and 28 healthy patients with normal lipid profiles (negative control group) were also studied as control groups.", 
    "99": "While the lipid profiles had been normalized, the levels of serum inflammatory markers were still higher in hypercholesterolaemic patients than in the healthy subjects. Up to 120 days after statin withdrawal there was no coronary event, but the lipid profiles and serum hsCRP levels had significantly rebounded in study patients. However, serum MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels remained unchanged and the MMP-3 level was even further reduced after statin withdrawal (115.04 +/- 84.54 vs. 92.71 +/- 66.71 ng mL(-1), P = 0.022). Moreover, the amplitudes of variation (%) of each parameter including MMPs, TIMP, hsCRP and lipid profiles after statin withdrawal were inversely correlated to their respective baseline levels before withdrawal (r = -0.702 to -0.284; P < 0.005).", 
    "100": "The effects of short-term discontinuation of statin were different on serum hsCRP and MMPs levels in hypercholesterolaemic patients. While lipid profiles and serum hsCRP level had rebounded the serum MMPs levels were still unchanged, or even reduced, suggesting the prolonged effect of statin treatment, especially on serum MMP-3 level up to 120 days after simvastatin withdrawal. Further work is required to clarify the situation both in terms of these serum markers and clinical effects.", 
    "101": "Using a retrospective study in general medicine, we observed the rates of achieving targets for LDL-cholesterol as recommended by the French Agency for the Safety of Health care Products (AFSSAPS) in 2000, according to the types of statin prescribed and the dosages used. Out of 64 961 individuals treated with a statin between 31 July 2001 and 1 August 2002, we identified 22 065 patients treated with monotherapy, having had an LDL-cholesterol level performed at least 6 weeks after starting treatment or after changing statin or dosage, and no longer than 6 months before the start of our study in the other cases. In primary prevention, 81.9% of patients attained their objectives. The success rates became less impressive with increasing levels of cardiovascular risk: 95.6%, 86.9%, 72.0% and 56.3% for 0, 1, 2 and 3 or more risk factors respectively (p < 0.0001). For secondary prevention, the targets were only met for 62.8% of patients. In total, only 77.8% of the entire sample met their targets. For each type of statin, higher doses were used for patients with higher cardiovascular risk, but the percentage of patients reaching their LDL-cholesterol targets diminished. In conclusion, under the current conditions of managing lipid risk, the LDL-cholesterol targets are not sufficiently met. Extrapolating from the data obtained in this study, about 300 000 patients in France require better management than recommended in the 2000 AFSSAPS guidelines.",

Being well-informed about statin increased the likelihood of being on continuous statin therapy after median of 15 months by 1.977 folds. Concerning targets, 64.7% of those in Group 1 reached the targets, whereas, 43% of those in Group 2 reached the targets (p = 0.002).

ATV was administered orally for 3 days. SL was administered intraperitoneally 18 h before surgery and 1400W intravenously 15 min before surgery.

ATV-1 + SL-0.7 (9 +/- 1%) reduced IS more than SL-0.7 alone (p = 0.012). 1400W abrogated the protective effect of ATV-10 (35 +/- 3%) and ATV-1 + SL-0.7 (34 +/- 1%). SL-0.7 and ATV-10 increased phosphorylated endothelial (P-eNOS; 210 +/- 2.5% and 220 +/- 8%) and inducible (iNOS; 151 +/- 1% and 154 +/- 1%) NOS expression, whereas ATV-1 did not. These changes were significantly enhanced by ATV-1 + SL-0.7 (P-eNOS, 256 +/- 2%, iNOS 195 +/- 1%). SL-1 increased P-eNOS (311 +/- 22%) and iNOS (185 +/- 1%) concentrations.",

    "110": "The aim of this study was to examine the clinical profile of statin-induced myalgia in patients with no apparent predisposing factors. Patients who reported muscle complaints that limited daily functioning during statin use were prospectively identified among the patients of Kuusankoski District Hospital and its catchment area, a population of about 100,000, between January 2003 and July 2004. Twenty patients in whom the muscle complaints were probably attributable to the use of a statin were included in this series. There were no cases of severe myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, and the highest creatine kinase value observed was only about 1900 U/l. Of the 18 patients that were evaluable for creatine kinase level, 5 (28%) did not exhibit elevation of creatine kinase and 6 (33%) showed a minor increase only. Following discontinuation of the statin, resolution of symptoms and normalisation of creatine kinase occurred in 11 of the 13 patients with elevated creatine kinase value as well as muscle complaints. Statins may cause clinically important muscle symptoms without inducing a marked creatine kinase elevation.", 
    "111": "We investigated prospectively the efficacy of ezetimibe in addition to statin therapy in stable renal transplant patients in whom hypercholesterolemia was not sufficiently treated. Eighteen renal transplant patients received 10 mg ezetimibe once daily in addition to high-dose statin therapy for uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, Tacrolimus (Tac)- and Cyclosporine A (CsA) blood levels, creatinine, urea, liver enzymes, electrolytes and creatinkinase (CK) were measured before initiation of ezetimibe therapy, after 7 days, 6 weeks and 3 months. Cholesterol concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.005) from 264 +/- 46 mg/dL at baseline to 205 +/- 48 mg/dL after 1 week to 202 +/- 48 mg/dL after 6 weeks and 212 +/- 40 mg/dL after 3 months (reduction after 3 months 21 +/- 10%). LDL-concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.005) from 178 +/- 41 mg/dL at baseline to 129 +/- 35 mg/dL after 1 week to 123 +/- 25 after 6 weeks and to 117 +/- 40 mg/dL after 3 months (reduction after 3 months 37 +/- 14%). Two patients stopped ezetimibe therapy due to nausea and muscle pain without CK elevation. Significant changes of CsA and Tac blood levels, liver and muscle enzymes were not observed. Ezetimibe seems to be an effective therapy for uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia in renal transplant patients when combined with high-dose statin therapy.", 
    "112": "Medication-attributed adverse effects are a frequent reason for poor compliance in practice and in clinical studies and are also common in patients receiving placebo. The occurrence of adverse effects in placebo groups can clarify the assessment of adverse event reporting. We analyzed data from randomized, placebo-controlled trials of statin drugs published since 1992 with sample sizes larger than 100 subjects. Reports of adverse effects and discontinuation rates in placebo groups were evaluated. We compared data on adverse effect profiles in placebo groups between trials and with expected rates from population-based studies. We also sought to determine the range of adverse effect ascertainment methods used in different studies. Methods of ascertainment of adverse events varied widely across studies. Overall, 4% to 26% of patients in the control groups of large trials of statin drugs discontinued placebo use because of perceived adverse effects. The symptom rate in placebo groups varied substantially across trials (up to a ratio of 13:1 for possibly drug-related symptoms, eg, headache, 0.2%-2.7%, or abdominal pain, 0.9%-3.9%) and were often markedly lower than those found in the general population (eg, fatigue, 1.9%-3.4%) in trials of statin drugs vs 17.7% in the general population. In conclusion, the widely varying rates of adverse effects reported by patients taking placebo and the high prevalence of such symptoms in the general population should be considered by both trialists and clinicians. In addition, variability of adverse effect ascertainment is considerable and suggests the need for better standardization in research.",

Study outcomes were outpatient use of beta-blockers, statins, and ACE inhibitors and/or ARBs within 90 days after MI. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess predictors of such use. Multivariate Cox regression was applied to test for associations between beta-blocker, statin, and ACE-inhibitor and/or ARB use and 1-year mortality.",

    "117": "Recent evidence suggests that statins improve the status of patients with coronary artery disease not only by reducing cholesterol levels, but also by acting at the level of the endothelium-smooth muscle unit. Previous results from our laboratory showed that these drugs interact with the vascular wall by partially inhibiting calcium-dependent, agonist-induced contractions in rat aortas. To evaluate whether this effect is also extended to the coronary vasculature, we assessed the effect of statins on serotonin (5-HT) induced contractions of left and right coronary arteries of swine. Concentration-response curves for the 5-HT-induced contractions (from 0.1 nmol/l to 100 micromol/l) were calculated on rings from both coronaries in the presence and absence of either (5 micromol/l) pravastatin, mevastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin. After a 45-min incubation period, all statins significantly reduced the Emax for the 5-HT-induced contractions, ranging from 51.9 +/- 1.9% (simvastatin) to 15.9 +/- 2.0% (pravastatin) in the left coronary artery and from 48.8 +/- 2.0% (simvastatin) to 17.8 +/- 2.5% (pravastatin) in the right coronary artery. The EC50 values for the 5-HT-induced contractions were 0.150 +/- 0.005 micromol/l for the left coronary artery and 0.171 +/- 0.010 micromol/l for the right coronary artery. These values significantly changed after incubation with statins, ranging from 1.240 +/- 0.101 micromol/l (for simvastatin) to 0.081+/- 0.008 micromol/l (for pravastatin) in the left coronary artery and from 1.410 +/- 0.075 micromol/l (for simvastatin) to 0.084 +/- 0.008 micromol/l (for pravastatin) in the right coronary artery. This evidence supports the possibility that, beyond their lipid-lowering properties, statins may provide a beneficial effect in atherosclerotic patients by reducing the tone in the coronary vasculature, facilitating blood flow to the myocardium.", 
    "118": "Relative changes in lumen size during progression and regression of coronary atherosclerosis remain largely unknown. We assessed these changes using serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). From the baseline IVUS interrogations of the Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) trial, 210 focal coronary lesions with <50% angiographic stenosis were identified. Lesions were matched to the follow-up IVUS, performed after 18 months of treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg/day or pravastatin 40 mg/day. Changes in external elastic membrane (EEM) and lumen areas of lesions demonstrating progression and regression (i.e. increased and decreased atheroma area) were examined. In progressors (n=128), there was 1.34 mm(2) increase in EEM area for every 1mm(2) increase in atheroma area (r=0.72, p<0.0001). This resulted in 0.34 mm(2) increase in lumen area for every 1mm(2) increase in atheroma area (r=0.25, p=0.004). In contrast, there was no significant change in lumen area with regression of disease (n=82, r=-0.06, p=0.59). Progression of coronary atherosclerosis can be associated with a paradoxical increase in lumen cross-sectional area, whereas regression is not associated with any change in lumen area. Measurement of changes in lumen size may not be an accurate method to study progression and regression of atherosclerotic lesions with <50% stenosis.", 
    "119": "Pericytes, which surround endothelial cells in precapillary arterioles, capillaries, and postcapillary venules, are important for the development, maturation, and maintenance of the vascular system. Pericytes are also pluripotent cells that can differentiate into a variety of mesenchymal cells including smooth muscle cells and osteoblasts. Possibly because of their vasculature regulating activities and ability to differentiate in situ, pericytes are implicated in several diseases with vascular complications, including diabetic retinopathy, as well as Reynaud's Syndrome, central nervous system dementias, and vascular calcification among others. Statin drugs, which block the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, are known to have apoptotic and growth inhibitory effects on cells in vitro and complex pleiotropic effects on cells and tissues in vivo. Recently, evidence has emerged that statin drug use in human patients results in a significant 20% reduction in cancer incidence. It is not known whether these results are due to direct statin action on normal tissue, growth inhibitory/pro-apoptotic effects on tumor cells, and/or effects on angiogenesis. Because of the role of pericytes in angiogenesis and the effects of statins on cancer incidence, we tested the direct effects of statins on pericytes. Specifically, we demonstrate that 3 statins, simvastatin, lovastatin, and mevastatin induce dose-dependent apoptosis in the TR-PCT1 pericyte cell line, that simvastatin (empirically shown to be the most potent of the 3 statins) induces similar levels of apoptosis in freshly isolated pericytes, and that simvastatin-induced apoptosis in pericytes is cholesterol, caspase-3, and caspase-7 mediated.", 
    "120": "The annual meeting of the Heart Failure Association of ESC in Lisbon, in June 2005, was exceptionally successful. There were many very interesting presentations and workshops with the unique title: Statins in heart failure- Cholesterol-lowering is not the only goal. Heart failure (HF) is a progressive disease with coronary artery disease (CAD) as the most often underlying etiology. Treatment to prevent progression of heart failure has been targeted to reverse the consequences of HF and to a less extent the cause - the atherosclerotic plaque itself. On the average 50% of patients with heart failure are treated with lipid intervention. Lipid-lowering treatment with statins clearly reduces morbidity and mortality of patients with documented CAD. Since the prevalent etiology of heart failure is CAD, its prevention may reduce heart failure progression. However, recent studies suggest that pleiotropic effects of statins are more important than the influence related to their cholesterol lowering mechanism. Furthermore it is suggested that low levels of circulating lipoproteins and cholesterol may be independent predictors of impaired outcome in patients with heart failure. There are some possible explanations for this finding. High levels of cholesterol can be beneficial to heart failure patients; cholesterol-rich serum lipoproteins are able to modulate inflammatory immune function because they bind and detoxify bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a very strong stimulator of the release of proinflammatory cytokines that promote heart failure progression and death. So current recommendations strongly emphasize that the aim of treatment of HF is not to lower cholesterol.", 
    "121": "The mevalonate pathway is relevant in bone cells. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the key enzyme of this route, stimulating osteoblast differentiation and activity. Pravastatin increases bone formation markers in postmenopausal women and bone density in diabetics. D-003 is a mixture of high-molecular-weight acids purified from sugarcane wax which inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis through HMG-CoA reductase regulation, preventing bone loss in osteoporosis induced with ovariectomy and prednisolone in rats. We investigated the effects of D-003 (50 mg/kg) and pravastatin (20 mg/kg) orally administered for 12 weeks to ovariectomized rats. Female rats were randomized in four groups (10 rats/group): two control groups treated with the vehicle, one false-operated (sham) and another ovariectomized (positive control), while two other groups received D-003 or pravastatin. Bone resorption and formation was studied through histomorphometry and apoptosis through immunohistochemistry. D-003 and pravastatin significantly (p < 0.001) prevented the changes of trabecular bone versus ovariectomized rats and (p < 0.001) the increase of the surface and number of osteoclasts versus ovariectomized controls. D-003 and pravastatin, however, did not modify osteoblast surfaces, a bone formation marker D-003 and pravastatin increased osteoclast apoptosis and reduced (p < 0.05) osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis versus ovariectomized controls; D-003 was more effective (p < 0.05) than pravastatin. In conclusion, D-003 (50 mg/kg) orally administered for 12 weeks prevented bone loss and bone resorption in ovariectomized rats, increasing osteoclast apoptosis. The preventive effects of D-003 on bone loss and resorption in ovariectomized rats are comparable to those of pravastatin. Both drugs inhibited osteoblast apoptosis but failed to change osteoblast surface. The effects of D-003 on bone cell apoptosis were greater than those of pravastatin. Therefore, D-003 could be used to prevent or treat bone loss in postmenopausal women, but further animal studies and clinical trials are required to confirm the clinical relevance of this potential effect.", 
    "122": "The study comprised 35 patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors (overweight or obesity, low physical activity, family history). Seventeen patients were administered atorvastatin in a dose of 10 mg and 18 -fluvastatin in a dose of 40 mg once daily at bed time for 6 weeks. The control group consisted of 12 clinically healthy subjects with no CHD risk factors. Blood samples for testing were collected from cubital vein of patients after hypolipaemic diet prior to and 6 weeks after drugs application and once in control group. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in erythrocytes and plasma were determined by the method of Placer et al. MDA concentrations in erythrocytes and plasma were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients than in healthy subjects. After 6-week atorvastatin therapy MDA concentrations in erythrocytes and plasma decreased to the values observed in healthy subjects.

Atorvastatin, contrary to fluvastatin, decreases lipid peroxidation in CHD risk patients.", 
    "123": "Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (protein phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome ten) predispose to heritable breast cancer. The transcription factor PPARgamma has also been implicated as a tumor suppressor pertinent to a range of neoplasias, including breast cancer. A putative PPARgamma binding site in the PTEN promoter indicates that PPARgamma may regulate PTEN expression. We show here that the PPARgamma agonist Rosiglitazone, along with Lovastatin, induce PTEN in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Lovastatin- or Rosiglitazone-induced PTEN expression was accompanied by a decrease in phosphorylated-AKT and phosphorylated-MAPK and an increase in G1 arrest. We demonstrate that the mechanism of Lovastatin- and Rosiglitazone-associated PTEN expression was a result of an increase in PTEN mRNA, suggesting that this increase was transcriptionally-mediated. Compound-66, an inactive form of Rosiglitazone, which is incapable of activating PPARgamma, was unable to elicit the same response as Rosiglitazone, signifying that the Rosiglitazone response is PPARgamma-mediated. To support this, we show, using reporter assays including dominant-negative constructs of PPARgamma, that both Lovastatin and Rosiglitazone specifically mediate PPARgamma activation. Additionally, we demonstrated that cells lacking PTEN or PPARgamma were unable to induce PTEN mediated cellular events in the presence of Lovastatin or Rosiglitazone. These data are the first to demonstrate that Lovastatin can signal through PPARgamma and directly demonstrate that PPARgamma can upregulate PTEN at the transcriptional level. Since PTEN is constitutively active, our data indicates it may be worthwhile to examine Rosiglitazone and Lovastatin stimulation as mechanisms to increase PTEN expression for therapeutic and preventative strategies including cancer, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "124": "We investigated the pleiotropic effects of a calcium antagonist (amlodipine) on early atherosclerosis development in the presence and absence of an HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor (atorvastatin) in apolipoprotein E*3-Leiden/human C-reactive protein (E3L/CRP) transgenic mice. Male E3L/CRP transgenic mice were fed a cholesterol-containing diet either with or without amlodipine and/or atorvastatin. After 31 weeks, atherosclerosis in the aortic root area was quantified. Treatment with amlodipine did not significantly lower blood pressure, but resulted in a 43% reduction (P < 0.03) of lesion area as compared with the untreated group. Treatment with atorvastatin resulted in an 80% reduction of lesion area as compared with the untreated group (P < 0.001). Combined treatment with amlodipine and atorvastatin decreased the lesion area by 93%, significantly more than either treatment alone (P < 0.008). Plasma C-reactive protein levels were mildly elevated, on average 10 +/- 6 mg/L, and did not differ between groups, neither on baseline nor during treatment. Treatment with amlodipine, independently of blood pressure lowering, reduced atherosclerosis development in E3L/CRP mice. Atorvastatin had a strong anti-atherosclerotic effect, whereas co-treatment with amlodipine enhanced this effect significantly. Plasma C-reactive protein levels were not affected by any of the three treatments.", 
    "125": "Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the product of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), acts through its receptors (EPs) and induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, which may favor the instability of atherosclerotic plaques. The effect of statins on EPs expression has not been previously studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of atorvastatin (ATV, 80 mg/d, for one month) on EP expression in plaques and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with carotid atherosclerosis. In addition, we studied the mechanisms by which statins could modulate EPs expression on cultured monocytic cells (THP-1) stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha). Patients treated with atorvastatin showed reduced EP-1 (14 +/- 1.8% versus 26 +/- 2%; P < 0.01), EP-3 (10 +/- 1.5% versus 26 +/- 1.5%; P < 0.05), and EP-4 expression (10 +/- 4.1% versus 26.6 +/- 4.9%; P < 0.05) in atherosclerotic plaques (immunohistochemistry), and EP-3 and EP-4 mRNA expression in PBMC (real time PCR) in relation to non-treated patients. In cultured monocytic cells, atorvastatin (10 micromol/L) reduced EP-1/-3/-4 expression, along with COX-2, mPGES-1, MMP-9, and PGE2 levels elicited by IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Similar results were noted with aspirin (100 micromol/L), dexamethasone (1 micromol/L), and the Rho kinase inhibitors Y-27632 and fasudil (10 micromol/L both). The effect of atorvastatin was reversed by mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. On the whole, we have shown that atorvastatin reduces EPs expression in atherosclerotic plaques and blood mononuclear cells of patients with carotid stenosis and in cultured monocytic cells. The inhibition of EP receptors could explain, at least in part, some of the mechanisms by which statins could modulate the COX-2/mPGES-1 proinflammatory pathway and favor plaque stabilization in humans.", 
    "126": "Vascular endothelial growth factor plays a pivotal role in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and causes instability of atherosclerotic plaques by inducing neoangiogenesis inside the current plaque. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL-) 6 induces vascular endothelial growth factor in smooth muscle cells (SMC). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), display beside their lipid-lowering potency various pleiotropic effects. Such pleiotropic effects include improvement of endothelial dysfunction, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory responses, and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. In this study we investigate the influence of statin treatment on the serum levels of VEGF in hypercholesterolemic patients. One hundred and seven hypercholesterolemic patients were treated with 20 (n = 52) or 40 mg (n = 55) simvastatin daily. Six weeks of treatment resulted in a significant decrease of VEGF from 1017.1 +/- 297.8 pg/mL at baseline to 543.5 +/- 317.4 pg/mL after 6 weeks (-47.7%) and to 211.8 +/- 155.3 pg/mL after 6 months (-79.7%; all P < 0.001). IL-6 induced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in human SMC as analyzed by rt-PCR and flow cytometry. Statins decreased the stimulatory effect of IL-6 on mRNA and protein levels. This effect could be inhibited by co-incubation with mevalonate acid. This study contributes in understanding the pleiotropic effects of statins particularly with regard to their use in treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

    "130": "Isoprenoid inhibitors are being evaluated as agents for the treatment of cancer. Their antitumor activity is attributed to inhibition of post-translational modification of Ras, which is crucial for its translocation and attachment to the plasma membrane, and ultimate involvement in signal transduction. However, whether blocking of Ras is solely responsible for the observed antitumor activity is unresolved. In this report, we propose an alternate mechanism. Using breast tumor models, we show that agents possessing a lactone moiety, including statins (such as lovastatin) and the isoprenoid inhibitors (such as FTI-277 and GGTI-298), mediate their cell cycle inhibitory activities by blocking the chymotrypsin activity of the proteasome in vitro. This results in the accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 with subsequent G(1) arrest. Cells devoid of p21 were refractory to the growth-inhibitory activity of lovastatin, FTI-277, and GGTI-298. However, in these p21 null cells, isoprenylation of key substrates of farnesyl transferase (such as Ras) and of geranylgeranyl transferase (such as RAP-1) were inhibited by FTI-277 and GGTI-298, respectively, suggesting that although both these isoprenoid inhibitors reached and inhibited their intended targets, inhibition of the isoprenylation of Ras and RAP-1A are not sufficient to mediate G(1) arrest. We also show that the cell cycle effects can be attributed to the functional lactone moiety of the aforementioned agents. Collectively, our data suggest that FTI and GGTI and other agents containing an active lactone moiety mediate G(1) arrest via inhibition of the proteasome and up-regulation of p21, independent of the inhibition of isoprenylation of Ras or RAP-1.",

We discuss three promising novel therapies studied in animal models and human tissue. All three therapies appear to prevent and reduce pulmonary arterial medial hyperplasia through their anti-proliferative and/or pro-apoptotic effects: serotonin transporter inhibitors by blocking serotonin uptake; dichloroacetate by activating voltage-gated potassium channels; and simvastatin by preventing activation of small GTPases.",

    "137": "The key 'statin trials' focussed on the beneficial effect of lowering the circulating concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL). However, epidemiological surveys, mainly based on healthy populations, indicate that other lipid-related variables, such as high-density cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides (TG), dense LDL subfraction distribution, and possibly lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), are also predictors of vascular events. Furthermore, TG and HDL levels influenced outcome within some of the statin trials. Plasma fibrinogen levels have also been shown to be powerful predictors of vascular risk in healthy subjects and patients with established ischaemic heart disease. The fibrates exert beneficial effects on all these variables that predict vascular events. The results from recent trials, the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) study and the Veterans Administration HDL Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) have revived our interest in fibrates. These trials involved bezafibrate and gemfibrozil that have a relatively poor LDL-lowering capacity. Therefore, the benefits reported in BIP and VA-HIT must be attributed to actions on variables other than a reduction in LDL quantity. Ciprofibrate and fenofibrate have significantly greater LDL-lowering capacity than bezafibrate or gemfibrozil. This advantage may render them more effective, especially since they retain the additional beneficial actions associated with this class of lipid-lowering drugs.",

For example endothelial dysfunction precedes clinical symptoms of atherothrombosis, such as acute coronary syndrome, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease or diabetic microangiopathies e.g. retinopathy and nephropathy. Accordingly, pharmacological reversal of endothelial dysfunction may represent a new approach in preventing the aforementioned vasculopathies. In modern cardiovascular pharmacology, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-I) or inhibitors of HydroxyMethylGlutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (statins) are among the most widely used cardiovascular drugs. Originally, ACE-I and statins were introduced to clinical medicine to lower arterial blood pressure or to lower blood LDL cholesterol levels, respectively. They were respectively targeted to inhibit ACE in blood or to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase in the liver. Surprisingly, these two classes of drugs apart from their classic mechanisms of action exert pleiotropic endothelial actions, which involve the inhibition of ACE or HMG-CoA reductase within the endothelium, as well as other less understood endothelial mechanisms. Typically, therapeutic effectiveness of ACE-I by far exceeds the benefits expected from their hypotensive effect or as the matter of fact of other hypotensive drugs. Similarly, statins offer cardiovascular protection irrespective of initial LDL cholesterol levels in patients. In our view, it is the endothelial action of ACE-I or statins that contributes significantly to their anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and vasculoprotective actions. Importantly, actions of ACE-I or statins are not limited to the correction of functioning of a single endothelial mediator, but they do possess a broader spectrum of endotheliotropic properties that proved efficient in preventing atherothrombosis and other vasculopathies. Quite surprisingly, the history of ACE-I and statins has a major impact for the future development in pharmacology of endothelium.",
