    "2": "There were no age-dependent differences in arteriolar responses to A23187 applied over a concentration range that dilated arterioles from 9 +/- 2 to 74 +/- 8% of maximum, and L-NMMA attenuated these responses by the same amount in both age groups. In juveniles, arterioles dilated up to 39+/-5% of maximum in response to VEGF, and up to 83 +/- 6% of maximum in response to simvastatin, with L-NMMA greatly reducing the responses to both agonists. In contrast, arterioles in weanlings did not dilate in response to either agonist.", 
    "3": "These findings suggest that some Ca2+-independent signaling pathways for endothelial NO release may not initially be operational in the arteriolar network, but quickly become established during juvenile growth. This is consistent with the idea that microvascular control mechanisms are not fixed at birth, but rather undergo progressive changes in concert with microvascular network growth and changes in tissue metabolic requirements.", 
    "4": "Id proteins (inhibitors of differentiation), which are involved in the control of cell cycle progression, can delay cellular differentiation and senescence and have been implicated in angiogenesis. The regulation of Id proteins in endothelial cells (ECs) by proangiogenic statins has not been investigated yet and remains unresolved. In this study, human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) were stimulated with fluvastatin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and serum in vitro. The regulation of Id1, Id3, p21, p27, and p53 and the phosphorylation of AKT was investigated by Western blotting. Id1 was up-regulated by fluvastatin and serum, but not by VEGF and HGF. Fluvastatin did not regulate p21 and p27, but down-regulated Id3 and p53 slightly. In contrast to VEGF and HGF, fluvastatin did not result in AKT phosphorylation, indicating that this pathway is not involved in the control of endothelial Id1 expression. These experiments demonstrate for the first time that Id1 can be up-regulated and p53 down-regulated by a statin in HDMECs. Regulation of these proteins in ECs may account for the proangiogenic effect of statins.",

CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 are the major enzymes responsible for the metabolism of cerivastatin, and a transporter, OATP2, contributes to uptake of cerivastatin to the liver. In this study, the patient's DNA was sequenced in order to identify a variant that would lead to the adverse effect of cerivastatin. Three nucleotide variants, 475delA, G874C, and T1551C, were found in the exons of CYP2C8. The patient was homozygous for 475delA variant that leads to frameshift and premature termination. Accordingly, the patient is most likely lacking the enzyme activity. The patient's children were both heterozygous for the mutation. The patient had three nucleotide variants in exon 4 (A388G) and exon 5 (C571T and C597T) of OATP2 that were all heterozygous. No nucleotide variation in the exons of CYP3A4 was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that the adverse effect of cerivastatin might be caused by the genetic variant of CYP2C8.", 
    "23": "Inflammatory responses involving microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, are thought to contribute importantly to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders. The present study tested whether the mevalonate-isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway, which affects inflammation in many types of tissues, tonically regulates microglial activation. This question takes on added significance given the potential use of statins, drugs that block the rate-limiting step (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase)) in mevalonate and cholesterol synthesis, in AD treatment. Both mevastatin and simvastatin caused a concentration- and time-dependent activation of microglia in cultured rat hippocampal slices. This response consisted of a transformation of the cells from a typical resting configuration to an amoeboid, macrophage-like morphology, increased expression of a macrophage antigen, and up-regulation of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Evidence for proliferation was also obtained. Statin-induced microglial changes were blocked by mevalonate but not by cholesterol, indicating that they were probably due to suppression of isoprenoid synthesis. In accord with this, the statin effects were absent in slices co-incubated with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, a mevalonate product that provides for the prenylation of Rho GTPases. Finally, PD98089, a compound that blocks activation of extracellularly regulated kinases1/2, suppressed statin-induced up-regulation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha but had little effect on microglial transformation. These results suggest that 1) the mevalonate-isoprenoid pathway is involved in regulating microglial morphology and in controlling expression of certain cytokines and 2) statins have the potential for enhancing a component of AD with uncertain relationships to other features of the disease.",

Patients were classified into 2 groups: patients receiving preoperative statin therapy (n=943) and patients not receiving preoperative antihyperlipidemic therapy (n=720). To determine if preoperative statin therapy was independently associated with a reduction in the risk of adverse postoperative outcomes, multivariate stepwise logistic regression was performed controlling for patient demographics, medical history, and preoperative medications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that preoperative statin therapy was independently associated with a significant reduction ( approximately 50%) in the risk of 30-day all-cause mortality (3.75% versus 1.80%; P<0.05). The adjusted odds ratio for early mortality in patients receiving preoperative statin therapy compared with patients not receiving antihyperlipidemic agents was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.28 to 0.99). Statin therapy was not independently associated with a reduced risk of postoperative MI, cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, or renal dysfunction. In an attempt to further control for selection bias related to the choice of therapy, multivariate analysis of a propensity-matched cohort of 1362 patients revealed that preoperative statin therapy was independently associated with a significant reduction in the composite endpoint of 30-day all-cause mortality and stroke (7.1% versus 4.6%; P<0.05).",

Moderate CKD was independently associated with an increased risk of the primary outcome (adjusted HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.49) compared with those with normal renal function. Among the 4491 subjects with moderate CKD, pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of the primary outcome (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.86), similar to the effect of pravastatin on the primary outcome in subjects with normal kidney function (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94).

    "30": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to block leukocyte-endothelial interaction independently of their cholesterol-lowering properties. The effects of statins are generally attributed to a decrease in mevalonate caused by inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, which results in an increase of nitric oxide (NO). However, a recent in vitro study demonstrated a novel effect which depended on the lipophilicity of statin and appeared to be unrelated to HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the proposed mechanism actually operates in vivo. We examined the effects of simvastatin (lipophilic) and pravastatin (hydrophilic) on leukocyte behavior in a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced leukocyte recruitment model. Leukocyte adhesion and rolling were examined in pial venules of rat brain by using confocal laser scanning microscopy after labeling leukocytes with rhodamine 6G. Experiments were conducted 4h after TNFalpha injection (0.5microg) in six groups: control, TNFalpha alone, TNFalpha + vehicle of simvastatin, TNFalpha + simvastatin (20mg/kg, 2ml/kg), TNFalpha + vehicle of pravastatin, and TNFalpha + pravastatin (40mg/kg, 2ml/kg). Statins and vehicles were injected subcutaneously for 3 days. TNFalpha caused a marked increase in rolling and adhered leukocytes. The number of adhered leukocytes in the simvastatin group was significantly less than in the vehicle group (276 +/- 38 cells/mm(2) versus 1155 +/- 89 cells/mm(2), P < 0.01), whereas pravastatin had little effect. Both simvastatin and pravastatin showed a tendency to decrease the number of rolling leukocytes, but there were no significant differences among TNFalpha-treated groups. Up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA or increased expression of P-selectin or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was not observed, and therefore cannot account for the simvastatin-induced reduction of adhered leukocytes. Markedly different effect on leukocyte adhesion between simvastatin and pravastatin under comparable level of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor was demonstrated in in vivo as was shown in in vitro study.", 
    "31": "Atherosclerosis is a complex process with multiple mechanisms and factors contributing to its initiation and progression. Detection and quantification of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores with electron beam tomography has been shown to correlate with obstructive and nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Pathogen-triggered calcification could play a role in CAD. Recent reports suggest that infectious blood nanobacteria (NB) emerge to be such a trigger. So far, minimal or no reversal of atherosclerosis has been claimed by therapies with iv ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA), antibiotics, or other regimens, and therapies for atherosclerosis remain non-curative. We have now combined EDTA with antibiotic tetracycline (comET), an in vitro proven nanobacteriocidal treatment, and tested comET therapy in patients with documented CAD. Three hypotheses were probed: (1) Are NB present in patients with CAD?; (2) Does treatment with comET affect blood NB antigen and serology?; (3) Does a comET decrease CAC scores? One hundred patients with stable CAD and positive CAC scores were enrolled into a 4 month study of comET therapy. ComET therapy is composed of (1) Nutraceutical Powder (Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, Niacin, Folic Acid, Selenium, EDTA, l-Arginine, l-Lysine, l-Ornithine, Bromelain, Trypsin, CoQ10, Grapeseed Extract, Hawthorn Berry, Papain) 5cm(3) taken orally every evening; (2) Tetracycline HCl 500mg taken orally every evening; (3) EDTA 1500mg taken in a rectal suppository base every evening. CAC scoring was repeated at 4 months and serum samples were analyzed for NB antigen and serology at baseline, 2 and 4 months. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, liver function, C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and lipids were analyzed at baseline and 4 months. Seventy-seven patients completed the study and all patients were positive for NB serology, antigen or both. Responders (n = 44; 57%) had significant decreases in total CAC scores (P = 0.001), the average decrease being 14%. Non-responders (n = 33; 44%) had no change or had increases in CAC scores. Angina was decreased or ablated in 16 of 19 patients (84%). Lipid profiles improved to non-atherogenic direction significantly (P = 0.001), a remarkable finding in a patient group where 86% were on continuous statin medication already before the trial. No adverse physiologic effects were seen in renal, hepatic, or hematopoetic systems. In conclusion, CAC scores decreased during ComET therapy trial in most CAD patients inferring regression of calcified coronary artery plaque volume. The patients tolerated the therapy well and their angina and lipid profiles improved. Further treatment trials for long term therapy with matched controls are warranted.", 
    "32": "Statins have cholesterol-independent effects including an increased vascular nitric oxide (NO) activity and are commonly used by patients with cardiovascular disease. Such patients frequently have erectile dysfunction, which may be treated with sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5. Since statins and sildenafil can activate the NO-cGMP pathway, we investigated whether pre-treatment with atorvastatin (0, 5 and 30 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks affects sildenafil (1 pM-100 mM)-induced relaxation of aortic rings isolated from Wistar rats. We also examined the hemodynamic consequences of this interaction in Wistar rats. Plasma nitrite/nitrate (NOx) concentrations were determined using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay. While pre-treatment with atorvastatin increased the potency of sildenafil-induced vasorelaxation (P<0.01), no differences were observed in the maximum sildenafil-induced relaxation. Pre-incubation of aortic rings with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) reversed atorvastatin-induced increase in the potency of sildenafil relaxation. In addition, pre-treatment with atorvastatin enhanced plasma NOx concentrations and sildenafil-induced hypotension and tachycardia (all P<0.05). These results suggest that atorvastatin increases the vascular sensitivity to sildenafil through NO-mediated mechanisms.",

This paper considers the distribution of the residence times for stochastic multi-compartment models, especially systems with non-exponential lifetime distributions. The paper first derives the moment generating function of the bivariate residence time distribution for the two-compartment model with general lifetimes and approximates the density of the residence time using the saddlepoint approximation. Then, it extends the distributional approach to the residence time for multi-compartment semi-Markov models combining the cofactor rule for a single destination and the analytic approach to the two-compartment model. This approach provides a complete specification of the residence time distribution based on the moment generating function and thus facilitates an easier calculation of high-order moments than the approach using the coefficient matrix. Applications to drug kinetics demonstrate the simplicity and usefulness of this approach.",

Recent studies have shown that short-term use of statins can reduce BP significantly. To determine the long-term effects of statins on BP and aortic stiffness, a single-blind randomized prospective study was performed on 85 hyperlipidaemic hypertensive patients whose BP was insufficiently controlled by antihypertensive therapy. Every 3 months, aortic stiffness was assessed by measuring pulse wave velocity (PWV). Patients were randomly allocated to groups treated with pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, or a nonstatin antihyperlipidaemic drug. No significant differences in patient characteristics, kinds of antihypertensive drugs, BP, ankle brachial index, PWV, or serum lipid, creatinine, or C-reactive protein levels were found between the four groups at the start of the study. During the 12-month treatment period, PWV did not change in the pravastatin group or nonstatin group, but it was transiently reduced in the simvastatin group and significantly decreased in the fluvastatin group, even though the doses of the statins used in this study were lower than the usually prescribed dose. All four antihyperlipidaemic drugs significantly decreased serum cholesterol levels without affecting BP, ankle brachial index, or serum triglyceride levels. The C-reactive protein serum levels decreased significantly in the three statin groups but not in the nonstatin group. These results suggest that long-term use of fluvastatin by hyperlipidaemic hypertensive patients is associated with a significant reduction in aortic stiffness without any effect on BP.", 
    "44": "We describe the design and implementation of a clinical decision support system for ambulatory hyperlipidemia management. Despite readily available and evidence-based guidelines, cholesterol control remains persistently sub-optimal in clinical practice. \"FastTrack\" is an integrated, multi-faceted informatics tool to reduce barriers to effective cholesterol management by proactively integrating pertinent clinical information, evidence-based decision support and a simple means to act via a single FastTrack e-mail. We tested the intervention in a randomized, controlled trial involving 14 physicians and 276 patients. In an interim analysis, we found that physicians on average were able to review and act upon 9 patient e-mails in less than 15 minutes. Significantly more intervention patients were initiated on a statin therapy or had their dose increased (15.3% vs. 2.3%, p < 0.001). Impact of the intervention on LDL levels will be assessed at trial completion.",

    "46": "Patients with a serum total cholesterol concentration of between 180 and 219 mg/dL at baseline were randomly assigned to two groups: the pravastatin group (n=54) and the group that did not receive cholesterol-lowering drugs (no-pravastatin group, n=66). A cost-minimization analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis were then performed from the perspective of a health insurance company, using insurance information obtained from the subjects. In the cost-minimization analysis, the expected costs associated with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and the pravastatin prescription were compared; the total medication costs between the two groups were also compared. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the estimated savings per event-free year were calculated.", 
    "47": "The median cost of a PTCA procedure was 1,323,492 yen. The expected insurance cost for two years was 182,532 yen per patient in the pravastatin group and 224,444 yen per patient in the no-pravastatin group. The cost-minimization analysis showed that the cost of healthcare for the no-pravastatin group was higher than that for the pravastatin group. The mean total cost of medication was 729,849 yen per patient in the pravastatin group and 989,606 yen per patient in the no-pravastatin group. The cost-effectiveness ratio for coronary heart disease was 2,766,994 yen.",

We suspect that disrupted drug metabolism, resulting from interactions with cytochrome P450 enzymes, rapidly elevated drug plasma levels, which then led to muscle toxicity. Clinicians who pharmacologically treat medical comorbidities in patients receiving atypical antipsychotics must be proactive in anticipating potential drug-drug interactions.", 
    "50": "Statins have been reported to lower the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease; however, the mechanism of this potentially important neuroprotective action is not understood. Lowering cholesterol levels does not appear to be the primary mechanism. Statins have pleiotropic effects in addition to lowering cholesterol, and statins may act on several different pathways involving distinct gene expression patterns that would be difficult to determine by focusing on a few genes or their products in a single study. In addition, gene expression patterns may be specific to a particular statin. To understand the molecular targets of statins in brain, DNA microarrays were used to identify gene expression patterns in the cerebral cortex of mice chronically treated with lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. Furthermore, brain statin levels were determined using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. These studies revealed 15 genes involved in cell growth and signaling and trafficking that were similarly changed by all three statins. Overall, simvastatin had the greatest influence on expression as demonstrated by its ability to modify the expression of 23 genes in addition to those changed by all three drugs. Of particular interest was the expression of genes associated with apoptotic pathways that were altered by simvastatin. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments confirmed the microarray findings. All three drugs were detected in the cerebral cortex, and acute experiments revealed that statins are relatively rapidly removed from the brain. These results provide new insight into possible mechanisms for the potential efficacy of statins in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease and lay the foundation for future studies.", 
    "51": "ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) is responsible in vivo for the formation of HDL by promoting the lipidation of apoprotein A-I (apoA-I) via cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from the liver. Treatment of patients with statins produces an increase in HDL plasma level, but the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. In this work we investigated the ability of pitavastatin to modulate ABCA1-mediated efflux from Fu5AH rat hepatoma cells, that here we demonstrate to express functional ABCA1 upon treatment with 22OH/cRA. In both basal and ABCA1 expressing cells pitavastatin 0.1-50microM induced a dose-dependent increase in cholesterol efflux to apoA-I; this effect was reversed by mevalonate or geranyl geraniol. A stimulatory effect was also observed on phospholipid efflux. Similar results were obtained with compactin, suggesting a class-related effect of statins. These results indicate a potential mechanism for the improvement in HDL plasma profile observed in patients treated with statins.", 
    "52": "The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued an evidence-based set of guidelines on cholesterol management in 2001. Since the publication of ATP III, 5 major clinical trials of statin therapy with clinical end points have been published. These trials addressed issues that were not examined in previous clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The present document reviews the results of these recent trials and assesses their implications for cholesterol management. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) remain an essential modality in clinical management. The trials confirm the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk patients and support the ATP III treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <100 mg/dL. They support the inclusion of patients with diabetes in the high-risk category and confirm the benefits of LDL-lowering therapy in these patients. They further confirm that older persons benefit from therapeutic lowering of LDL-C. The major recommendations for modifications to footnote the ATP III treatment algorithm are the following. In high-risk persons, the recommended LDL-C goal is <100 mg/dL, but when risk is very high, an LDL-C goal of <70 mg/dL is a therapeutic option, ie, a reasonable clinical strategy, on the basis of available clinical trial evidence. This therapeutic option extends also to patients at very high risk who have a baseline LDL-C < 100 mg/dL. Moreover, when a high-risk patient has high triglycerides or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2+ risk factors and 10-year risk 10% to 20%), the recommended LDL-C goal is <130 mg/dL, but an LDL-C goal <100 mg/dL is a therapeutic option on the basis of recent trial evidence. The latter option extends also to moderately high-risk persons with a baseline LDL-C of 100 to 129 mg/dL. When LDL-lowering drug therapy is employed in high-risk or moderately high-risk persons, it is advised that intensity of therapy be sufficient to achieve at least a 30% to 40% reduction in LDL-C levels. Moreover, any person at high risk or moderately high risk who has lifestyle-related risk factors (eg, obesity, physical inactivity, elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, or metabolic syndrome) is a candidate for TLC to modify these risk factors regardless of LDL-C level. Finally, for people in lower-risk categories, recent clinical trials do not modify the goals and cutpoints of therapy.", 
    "53": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare condition but associated with 90% mortality if left untreated. The diagnosis is usually made when there is thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, although the full pentad also includes fever, renal impairment, and neurological dysfunction. A variety of underlying causes have been implicated in acquired TTP including bacterial and viral infections, bone marrow and organ transplantation, pregnancy, immune disorders, and certain drugs. To date there is just one case report of TTP associated with statin treatment. The clinical course of a patient who presented with TTP after being started on simvastatin, a HMG-CoA inhibitor, is described.", 
    "54": "Lipid profile is often performed on heparinized-plasma because nothing in particular is explained in the technical data sheet about anticoagulant and because few data (mainly with EDTA anticoagulant) are available in literature. In order to evaluate heparinized-plasma vs serum differences, 50 normo- or hyperlipidemic samples were collected and assayed in 3 clinical laboratories in Lyon on Hitachi analysers with Roche Diagnostic reagents. Lipid values are lower in plasma than in serum; the average negative bias for cholesterol levels is 2 to 4,5% and for triglycerides about 3%, depending on the laboratory; the effect on HDL-cholesterol values is not significant. These results were confirmed by manual procedure on 28 samples with Roche Diagnostic reagent and two similar other reagents (Biomerieux and Randox). A negative bias of 4% on total cholesterol and triglycerides levels is not very important for clinical diagnosis but it is more serious for LDL-cholesterol estimated with Friedewald equation; LDL-cholesterol value needs accuracy because it is a therapeutic goal with statin therapy and an high negative bias (until 0,70 g/L in our results) is unacceptable; moreover, there is a real risk of providing false total cholesterol results. Therefore it is essential to collect blood for lipid profile without any anticoagulant.", 
    "55": "Oxidized phospholipids (OxPL) are present within atherosclerotic plaques and bound by lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] in plasma. This study evaluated the impact of atorvastatin on oxidized LDL (OxLDL) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS).", 
    "56": "OxLDL-E06 (OxPL content on apolipoprotein B-100 [apoB] detected by antibody E06), apoB-100 immune complexes (apoB-IC), OxLDL autoantibodies, and Lp(a) levels were measured in 2341 patients at baseline and after 16 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg/d or placebo. The OxLDL-E06 and apoB-IC data are reported per apoB-100 particle (OxPL/apoB, IC/apoB) and as total levels on all apoB-100 particles (total apoB-OxPL and total apoB-IC [eg, OxPL/apoB or IC/apoBxapoB-100 levels]). Compared with baseline values, atorvastatin reduced apoB-100 (-33%), total apoB-OxPL (-29.7%), total apoB-IC IgG (-29.5%), and IgM (-25.7%) (P<0.0001 for all), whereas no change or an increase was observed with placebo. When normalized per apoB-100, compared with placebo, atorvastatin increased OxPL/apoB (9.5% versus -3.9%, P<0.0001) and Lp(a) (8.8% versus -0.7%, (P<0.0001). A strong correlation was noted between OxPL/apoB and Lp(a) (R=0.85, P<0.0001), consistent with previous data that Lp(a) binds OxPL.", 
    "57": "After atorvastatin treatment, total OxPL on all apoB-100 particles was decreased. However, there was enrichment of OxPL on a smaller pool of apoB-100 particles, in parallel with similar increases in Lp(a), suggesting binding by Lp(a). These data support the hypothesis that atorvastatin promotes mobilization and clearance of proinflammatory OxPL, which may contribute to a reduction in ischemic events after ACS.", 
    "58": "Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality in the United States despite the use of new pharmacologic therapy, lifestyle modifications, and different coronary interventions. Atherosclerosis represents a wide variety of pathologic lesions with different clinical impacts. In this review, we address the current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the development of atherosclerosis. We define atherosclerosis as a multifactorial process representing a series of molecular and cellular mechanisms and involving multiple interactions between lipid metabolism, monocyte activation, endothelial cells, cytokines and/or other intracellular metabolic pathways. We also imply that control of atherosclerosis could be achieved through therapeutic interventions at different sites of the inflammatory process. Therapeutic targets could include cytokine pathways, growth factors, transcription factors, defective genes and other intracellular metabolic pathways.", 
    "59": "Peroxisomes are ubiquitous subcellular organelles and abnormality in their biogenesis and specific gene defects leads to fatal demyelinating disorders. We report that neuroinflammatory disease in brain of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rats decreased the peroxisomal functions. Degradation of very long chain fatty acids decreased by 47% and resulted in its accumulation (C26:0, 40%). Decreased activity (66% of control) of dihydroxyacetonephosphate acyltransferase (DHAP-AT), first enzyme in plasmalogens biosynthesis, resulted in decreased levels of plasmalogens (16-30%). Catalase activity, a peroxisomal enzyme, was also reduced (37%). Gene microarray analysis of EAE spinal cord showed significant decrease in transcripts encoding peroxisomal proteins including catalase (folds 3.2; p<0.001) and DHAP-AT (folds 2.6; p<0.001). These changes were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, suggesting that decrease of peroxisomal functions in the central nervous system will have negative consequences for myelin integrity and repair because these lipids are major constituents of myelin. However, lovastatin (a cholesterol lowering and anti-inflammatory drug) administered during EAE induction provided protection against loss/down-regulation of peroxisomal functions. Attenuation of induction of neuroinflammatory mediators by statins in cultured brain cells [J. Clin. Invest. 100 (1997) 2671-2679], and in central nervous system of EAE animals and thus the EAE disease [J. Neurosci. Res. 66 (2001) 155-162] and the studies described here indicate that inflammatory mediators have a marked negative effect on peroxisomal functions and thus on myelin assembly and that these effects can be prevented by treatment with statins. These observations are of importance because statins are presently being tested as therapeutic agents against a number of neuroinflammatory demyelinating diseases.", 
    "60": "A 41-year old male patient presented with yellowish papules on the elbows, upper arms, back and the buttocks, as well as yellow streaks in the palmar creases. Laboratory examination revealed Fredrickson type IIb hyperlipidemia. Histologic changes were consistent with eruptive xanthomas. Treatment was started with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and dietary measures were taken to lower serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Hyperlipidemia is the cause of eruptive xanthomas and strongly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "61": "Statins inhibit platelet reactivity and reduce blood thrombogenicity. The effectiveness of clopidogrel in inhibiting platelet reactivity was suggested to be reduced in the presence of atorvastatin due to shared enzymes in metabolism. Healthy individuals, 17 pretreated with atorvastatin (20 mg/d for 3 days) and 17 without pretreatment, as well as 15 patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and concurrent atorvastatin therapy were started on clopidogrel (loading dose 300 mg, then 75 mg/d). P-selectin on platelet surface after stimulation with ADP or Thrombin Receptor Activating Peptide (TRAP) was flow cytometrically measured before and during clopidogrel administration. Whole blood platelet agglutination was tested by a platelet function assay.TRAP and - in trend - ADP induced p-selectin exposure was reduced by the atorvastatin pretreatment before clopidogrel was added. Combining clopidogrel with atorvastatin in the healthy individuals led to a further reduction in ADP-induced platelet p-selectin exposure. Clopidogrel also reduced platelet reactivity in CAD patients with concurrent atorvastatin medication. We conclude that pretreatment with atorvastatin reduces platelet reactivity before administration of clopidgrel. No drug interaction was seen, however, platelet inhibitory effects were observed during the treatment with clopidogrel and atorvastatin.",

    "63": "Mevastatin and pravastatin activated serine/threonine kinase Akt in neonatal cardiomyocytes dose and time dependently with maximal activation at 15 min/10 microM. Caspase-3 activity was induced 2.73 +/- 0.29-fold by 6 h of hypoxia followed by 18 h of reoxygenation. Pravastatin added at the beginning of the reoxygenation period reduced caspase-3 activation to 1.26 +/- 0.06-fold compared to control cells (P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained for mevastatin (decreased to 1.98 +/- 0.45-fold, P < 0.05). TUNEL staining of neonatal cardiomyocytes after 24 h reoxygenation and 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining of adult rat cardiomyocytes after 6 h H(2)O(2) showed reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the presence of statin. Analysis of signaling pathways downstream of Akt revealed phosphorylation of GSK3beta. Transcription factor cAMP-responsive element binding (CREB) protein showed weak phosphorylation at serine 133; transcription factor NF-kappaB was not significantly activated after statin treatment as evaluated by EMSA. The GSK3beta target protein beta-catenin was stabilized at 3 h after statin treatment both in neonatal as well as adult rat cardiomyocytes. Transfection with constitutive active GSK3betaS9A sensitized neonatal cardiomyocytes to hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced apoptosis as measured by annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Furthermore, myocardial protein extracts of mice revealed GSK3beta inactivation after administration of pravastatin intraperitoneally.",

    "65": "The effects of metabolic inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis on the trafficking of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) to the cell membrane were studied in living CHO-K1/A5, a Chinese hamster ovary clonal line that heterologously expresses adult alpha2betadeltaepsilon mouse AChR. To this end, we submitted CHO-K1/A5 cells to long-term cholesterol deprivation, elicited by Mevinolin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase and applied a combination of biochemical, pharmacological and fluorescence microscopy techniques to follow the fate of the AChR. When CHO-K1/A5 cells were grown for 48 h in lipid-deficient medium supplemented with 0.5 microM Mevinolin, total cholesterol was significantly reduced (40%). Concomitantly, the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of the cell-surface AChR for the competitive antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin was reduced from 647+/-30 to 352+/-34 fmol/mg protein, i.e. by 46%. The apparent dissociation constant (Kdapp) for alpha-bungarotoxin of the AChRs remaining at the cell surface was not modified by cholesterol depletion. Similarly, the half-concentration inhibiting the specific binding of the radioligand (IC50) for another competitive antagonist, d-tubocurarine, did not differ from that in control cells. The decrease in cell-surface AChR was paralleled by an increase in intracellular AChR levels, which rose from 44+/-2.1% in control cells to 74+/-3.3% in Mevinolin-treated cells. When analyzed by wide-field fluorescence microscopy, the fluorescence signal arising from alpha-bungarotoxin labeled cell-surface AChRs was reduced by approximately 70% in Mevinolin-treated cells. The distribution of intracellular AChR also changed: Alexa594-alpha-bungarotoxin-labeled AChR exhibited a highly compartmentalized pattern, concentrating at the perinuclear and Golgi-like regions. Temperature-arrest of protein trafficking magnified this effect, emphasizing the Golgi localization of the AChR. Colocalization studies using the transiently expressed fluorescent trans-Golgi/trans-Golgi network marker pEYFP/human beta1,4-galactosyltransferase and the trans-Golgi network marker syntaxin 6 provided additional support for the Golgi localization of intracellular AChRs. The low AChR cell-surface expression and the increase in intracellular AChR pools in cholesterol-depleted cells raise the possibility that cholesterol participates in the trafficking of the receptor protein to the plasmalemma and its stability at this surface location.",

Patients were evaluated for clinical risk factors (age>70 years, histories of MI, angina, diabetes mellitus, stroke, renal failure, heart failure and pulmonary disease), DSE, statin and beta-blocker use. The main outcome was a composite of perioperative mortality and MI within 30 days of surgery.", 
    "69": "Perioperative mortality or MI occurred in 51 (8.9%) patients.

After correcting for other covariates, the association between statin use and reduced incidence of the composite endpoint remained unchanged (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.10-0.70; p=0.01). Beta-blocker use was also associated with a significant reduction in the composite endpoint (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.11-0.54).

Unfortunately, less than a third of patients with both conditions are identified, and fewer than one in ten reach the treatment goals for both factors. Adherence to treatment is notably improved when therapy is initiated simultaneously. Combination therapy of amlodipine besylate (Norvasc, Pfizer Ltd) with atorvastatin calcium (Lipitor, Pfizer Ltd), marketed as Caduet (Pfizer Ltd) is the first dual-therapy compound designed to treat hypertension and/or angina and dyslipidemia concurrently with a single daily pill in the full range of dosing combinations.

    "72": "Cardiovascular diseases due to atherosclerosis are the leading causes of mortality in the Western world. Cholesterol-lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme Areductase inhibitors (statins) has demonstrated a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diverse populations. Fluvastatin (Lescol, Novartis Pharmaceuticals) was the first totally synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor on the market and has recently become available in an extended-release formulation (Lescol XL, Novartis Pharmaceuticals). Data from several clinical outcome trials have shown substantial benefits from fluvastatin treatment in diverse populations. Fluvastatin exists primarily in its acid form and as inactive metabolites in vivo, while active metabolites as well as the lactone form are only present in small amounts. The demonstration of the safe use of fluvastatin in a wide range of patients may be associated with the predominant acid form of the drug in vivo, as well as its predominant metabolism via the cytochrome P450 2C9 pathway.", 
    "73": "Since they share a common mode of action and certain structural features, all statins exhibit the same broad pharmacological effects. Nevertheless, important differences exist between the statins in terms of LDL cholesterol-lowering, endpoint reduction, pleiotropic effects and toxicity. For this reason, it is incorrect to view all statins as being interchangeable as lipid-lowering therapy. In addition, it should be remembered that perhaps the main difficulty in clinical practice today does not concern details of the differences between statins but rather the fact that in many studies long-term compliance has been shown to be only around 30%.", 
    "74": "We investigated the in vivo effect of atorvastatin on bone mineral density (BMD) in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Eight-week-old female rats underwent either a sham operation or ovariectomy, and treatments with vehicle, atorvastatin, 17beta-estradiol (E2) and human parathyroid hormone(1-34) [hPTH(1-34)] were initiated 6 wk after the surgery. E2 (10 microg/kg) treatment for 12 wk significantly increased lumbar BMD (L2-L4), whereas atorvastatin did not affect lumbar BMD. The combination of atorvastatin (2 mg/kg) and E2 significantly enhanced the BMD of lumbar vertebrae (L2-L4) and femoral metaphyseal area (2/10-4/10 segments from the most proximal point) compared to that of either E2 or atorvastatin alone. A low dose 1 micro g/kg of hPTH (1-34) did not alter lumbar or femoral BMD, whereas a high dose 17.5 micro g/kg of the peptide significantly increased BMD. Concomitant injections of atorvastatin (2 mg/kg) with hPTH(1-34) (1 microg/kg) for 8 wk significantly enhanced the BMD of lumbar vertebrae and the metaphyseal area of the femur in OVX rats. These findings demonstrate that chronic administration of atorvastatin appears to modestly enhance the BMD of the lumbar vertebrae and femoral metaphysis of OVX rats treated with submaximal doses of E2 and hPTH(1-34).",

    "81": "We examined the effects of statins on phagocytosis of antibody-coated red blood cells by cultured human monocytes and mouse peritoneal macrophages. Lovastatin, simvastatin, and zaragozic acid, a squalene synthase inhibitor, blocked Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis by cultured human monocytes and mouse peritoneal macrophages. The inhibitory effect of lovastatin on Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis was prevented completely by addition of mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, LDL, or cholesterol to the culture medium. The inhibitory effect of zaragozic acid was reversed by addition of LDL, but not by the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, to the medium. In addition, the effect of lovastatin on phagocytosis is a function of cell activation because treatment of cells with tumor necrosis factor-alpha or lipopolysaccharide prevented inhibition of phagocytosis by lovastatin.",

    "83": "To gain a better understanding of the metabolic stability and transport of pitavastatin (CAS 147526-32-7), a new and potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, experiments were conducted using human hepatocytes and oocytes of Xenopus laevis expressing human organic anion transporting polypeptide-2 (OATP2), respectively. Almost the entire radioactivity was from the unchanged substance or lactone form in human hepatocytes, and the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism of pitavastatin was negligible. The results suggested that CYPs are not critically involved in determining the metabolic fate of pitavastatin. The hepatic uptake of pitavastatin reached saturation with a Km of 2.99 +/- 0.79 micromol/L. Also, the uptake of pitavastatin was mediated by OATP2 expressed in oocytes with a Km of 5.53 +/- 1.70 micromol/L. These results indicated that OATP2 plays a major role in the distribution of pitavastatin in liver. Furthermore, to elucidate the increase in the plasma concentration of pitavastatin in a clinical setting, the inhibitory effect of ciclosporin (cyclosporin A, CAS 59865-13-3) on the uptake of pitavastatin was examined. The uptake of pitavastatin was inhibited in the presence of cyclosporin A and the apparent IC50 value was 2.91 +/- 0.78 micromol/L. This result may at least partly explain the drug-drug interaction between pitavastatin and cyclosporin A. In conclusion, the characterization of transporters needs to be taken into account to avoid transporter-mediated drug-drug interaction.", 
    "84": "Possible mechanisms for the cholesterol-lowering effects of plant stanol esters were addressed by feeding hamsters diets containing stanol esters, cholesterol, or cholestyramine/lovastatin. ABCA1, ATP binding cassette G1 (ABCG1), ABCG5, ABCG8, and Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) mRNA levels were then estimated in duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Plasma cholesterol was decreased by 36% and 94% in animals fed stanol esters and cholestyramine/lovastatin, respectively. Cholesterol feeding increased plasma cholesterol by 2.5-fold. Plasma plant sterols were unchanged by stanol ester feeding but became undetectable by feeding cholestyramine/lovastatin. Cholesterol and stanols accumulated in enterocytes of animals fed cholesterol and stanol esters, respectively. ABCG5 and ABCG8 mRNA levels were decreased by stanol esters and cholestyramine/lovastatin. Cholesterol feeding markedly increased ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression and modestly increased ABCG5/ABCG8. NPC1L1 mRNA was not significantly altered by any of the diets. ABCG1, ABCG5, ABCG8, and NPC1L1 mRNAs were highest in cells of the upper villus, whereas ABCA1 mRNA was highest in cells of the lower villus. The results suggest that cholesterol lowering effect of stanol esters is unrelated to changes in mRNA levels of intestinal ABC sterol transporters or NPC1L1. Cholesterol flux regulates ABC expression but not NPC1L1. The different localization of ABCA1 suggests a different function for this protein than for ABCG1, ABCG5, ABCG8, and NPC1L1.",

This clinical entity has been considered to be a distinct disease process referred to as 'diabetic cardiomyopathy'. Experimental studies suggest that extensive metabolic perturbations may underlie both functional and structural alterations of the diabetic myocardium. Translational studies are, however, limited and only partly explain why diabetic patients are at increased risk of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Although a range of diagnostic methods may help to characterize alterations in cardiac function in general, none are specific for the alterations in diabetes. Treatment paradigms are very much limited to interpretation and translation from the results of interventions in non-diabetic patients with heart failure. This suggests that there is an urgent need to conduct pathogenetic, diagnostic and therapeutic studies specifically in diabetic patients with cardiomyopathy to better understand the factors which initiate and progress diabetic cardiomyopathy and to develop more effective treatments.", 
    "88": "Elderly patients are significantly less likely to receive statins than younger patients possibly because of doubts regarding compliance or concerns regarding the increased likelihood of adverse events and drug interactions. Poor compliance can be expected especially in patients suffering from dementia or depression as well as those whose stage of cardiovascular disease exhibits few symptoms. On the other hand, the clinical significance of CHD events is high in the elderly, and 80% of coronary deaths occur in patients aged over 65 years. The average statistical life expectancy of elderly and old patients is often underestimated. The HPS and PROSPER studies showed that statins reduce mortality and morbidity even in very elderly individuals with a high global cardiovascular risk and/or CAD. Patients up to the age of 79 years should be treated according to the same guidelines as younger patients. Statin therapy should only be considered for patients aged 80 years and older who are at a very high risk for cardiovascular events.",

Platelet aggregation decreased only in atorvastatin 40 mg/day group (p<0.05) and CRP decreased in combined atorvastatin group (p<0.05). Most pronounced relationship existed between changes of lipid levels and vWF. Lowering of total and LDL CH correlated positively with decreases of vWF (r=0.25, p=0.018, and r=0.23, p=0.032, respectively) and quartile analysis showed that vWF decreased only in patients with marked LDL CH lowering (quartiles 3, 4). Negative correlation was found between changes of total CH and those of TAT (r=-0.22, p=0.039), and between changes of CRP and HDL CH (r=-0.24, p=0.03).

Favorable pleiotropic effects of atorvastatin such as normalization of endothelial function, antiinflammatory, antithrombotic and antioxidant activity contribute to stabilization of atheromatous plaques.

    "94": "HLA class I ligation on graft endothelial cells (EC) has been shown to promote graft arteriosclerosis and chronic allograft nephropathy. This study investigated transcriptional and functional changes mediated by anti-HLA antibodies (Ab), developed by transplant recipient, on vascular renal EC. For mimicking interactions that occur between alloantibodies and graft endothelium, HLA-typed primary cultures of human EC were incubated in vitro in the presence of monomorphic or polymorphic anti-HLA class I Ab. Gene expression analysis identified the upregulation of several molecules involved in cell signaling and proliferation, including the GTP-binding protein RhoA. It was demonstrated further that HLA class I ligation on EC induced a rapid translocation of RhoA to the cell membrane associated with F-actin stress fiber formation and cytoskeleton reorganization. Western blot analysis showed that anti-HLA class I Ab induced, in addition to RhoA, the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, reflected by the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and GSK3beta (Ser9), in EC. C3 exoenzyme, an inhibitor of RhoA, inhibited RhoA translocation in response to HLA class I ligation and reduced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation. EC proliferation and cell cycle progression, examined by 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining, demonstrated that anti-HLA-induced EC proliferation was efficiently prevented by the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (0.1 micromol/L) through inhibition of RhoA geranylgeranylation. Taken together, these findings support the conclusion that RhoA is a key mediator of signaling pathways that lead to cytoskeletal reorganization and EC proliferation in response to alloantibodies that bind to HLA class I and demonstrate the specific and potent inhibitory effect of simvastatin on allostimulated EC growth.", 
    "95": "Renal proximal tubule cells are responsible for the reabsorption of proteins that are present in the tubular lumen. This occurs by receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process that has a requirement for some GTP-binding proteins. Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase used for the therapeutic reduction of cholesterol-containing plasma lipoproteins. However, they can also reduce intracellular levels of isoprenoid pyrophosphates that are derived from the product of the enzyme, mevalonate, and are required for the prenylation and normal function of GTP-binding proteins. The hypothesis that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in renal proximal tubule cells could reduce receptor mediated-endocytosis was therefore tested. Five different statins inhibited the uptake of FITC-labeled albumin by the proximal tubule-derived opossum kidney cell line in a dose-dependent manner and in the absence of cytotoxicity. The reduction in albumin uptake was related to the degree of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Simvastatin (e.g., statin) inhibited receptor-mediated endocytosis of both FITC-albumin and FITC-beta(2)-microglobulin to similar extents but without altering the binding of albumin to the cell surface. The effect on albumin endocytosis was prevented by mevalonate and by the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not by cholesterol. Finally, evidence that the inhibitory effect of statins on endocytosis of proteins may be caused by reduced prenylation and thereby decreased function of one or more GTP-binding proteins is provided. These data establish the possibility in principle that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins in proximal tubule cells may reduce tubular protein reabsorption.", 
    "96": "The proximal tubular cells of the kidney are responsible for reabsorption of proteins from the tubular lumen. In a study using Opossum kidney (OK) cells, receptor-mediated protein endocytosis was reduced by statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, which are widely used for therapeutic reduction of plasma cholesterol levels. To explore the possible clinical relevance of the observations in OK cells, protein endocytosis in human kidney tubular cells was investigated in the presence and absence of statins. The uptake of FITC-labeled albumin in these cultures of human kidney tubular cells was investigated by microscopy, flow cytometry and spectrofluorometry. Protein uptake occurred selectively into proximal tubular cells while it was absent in distal tubular/collecting duct cells. Three statins (simvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) significantly inhibited the uptake of protein in a concentration-dependent way. This inhibitory effect of statins could be prevented by the co-addition of mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase. This effect was not the result of a statin-induced cytotoxicity since cell-viability was unaffected. Finally, it was demonstrated that statins strongly inhibited cholesterol synthesis in the human kidney tubular cells. These data suggest that statins have the potential to inhibit albumin uptake by the human proximal nephron as a result of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the proximal tubule cells. Taken into account the data of the accompanying manuscript this inhibitory effect most probably results from a reduced prenylation of some proteins critically involved in endocytosis. It is suggested that these data help to explain the occurrence of proteinuria in some patients treated with high statin doses.",

In this study, we examined its neuroprotective effects against hippocampal CA1 neuronal damage following transient cerebral ischemia in gerbils. Forebrain ischemia was induced by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries for 5 min. Pitavastatin, at a dose of 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, was administered orally twice a day for 5 consecutive days and transient cerebral ischemia was induced in mice 1 h after the last treatment with pitavastatin. Histopathological observations showed that neuronal damage to the hippocampal CA1 neurons, which was observed 5 days after ischemia in animals, was prevented by pitavastatin treatment. Immunohistochemical staining for copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) and manganese SOD decreased in the hippocampal CA1 sector of gerbils 2 days after ischemia when histological neuronal destruction was not yet found, but was clearly observed in pitavastatin-treated animals. These results indicate that pitavastatin can protect dose-dependently against ischemia-induced neuronal damage and that the mechanism of the neuroprotection may be related to the preservation of SODs, especially copper/zinc-SOD. This in part explains how pitavastatin therapy, which targets free radicals, has beneficial effects against disorders including ischemic stroke.", 
    "102": "Statins are drugs widely used in humans to treat hypercholesterolemia. Statins act by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis resulting in the activation of the transcription factor sterol-responsive element-binding protein-2 that controls the expression of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Statin therapy also decreases plasma triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid levels, but the mechanism behind this effect remains more elusive. Liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) plays a role in the influx of long-chain fatty acids into hepatocytes. Here we show that L-FABP is a target for statins. In rat hepatocytes, simvastatin treatment induced L-FABP mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, L-FABP promoter activity was induced by statin treatment. Progressive 5'-deletion analysis revealed that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-responsive element located at position -67/-55 was responsible for the statin-mediated transactivation of the rat L-FABP promoter. Moreover, treatment with simvastatin and the PPARalpha agonist Wy14,649 resulted in a synergistic induction of L-FABP expression (mRNA and protein) in rat Fao hepatoma cells. This effect was also observed in vivo in wild-type mice but not in PPARalpha-null animals demonstrating the direct implication of PPARalpha in L-FABP regulation by statin treatment. Statin treatment resulted in a rise in PPARalpha mRNA levels both in vitro and in vivo and activated the mouse PPARalpha promoter in a reporter assay. Altogether, these data demonstrate that L-FABP expression is up-regulated by statins through a mechanism involving PPARalpha. Moreover, PPARalpha might be a statin target gene. These effects might contribute to the triglyceride/non-esterified fatty acid-lowering properties of statins.",

Although metabolic syndrome is not yet recognized as a CHD risk equivalent and use of Framingham risk scoring may not place some patients with the syndrome in the highest risk category, there is accumulating evidence that these patients are at very elevated risk and should be treated aggressively. Particular problems in risk assessment arise in immigrant groups such as South Asians, in whom traditional risk assessment may be inaccurate. In this article, Dr Deedwania examines the clinical evidence regarding cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes and metabolic syndrome and discusses current therapeutic options. Two case reports are presented, followed by roundtable discussions among the contributors to this Special Report.", 
    "127": "The currently recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal of < 100 mg/dL in high-risk patients is a reasonable target of lipid-lowering therapy. Indeed, recent studies have suggested that the optimal level of LDL-C level may be < 70 mg/dL. However, there is considerable evidence that lipid measures other than LDL-C may be more accurate predictors of cardiovascular risk and thus may be useful in addition to LDL-C in guiding treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk. Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) provides a measure of all atherogenic, apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins and can be calculated from a standard lipid panel. Baseline non-HDL-C level has been found to be superior to LDL-C level in predicting cardiovascular risk. Currently, non-HDL-C is recommended as a secondary target of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with elevated triglycerides. Apo B may also be useful in risk assessment and determining optimal therapy; apo B level and apo B/apo A-I ratio on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (\"statin\") therapy have been found to be strong predictors of risk of acute vascular events. Available data indicate that optimal apo B levels may not be achieved even with what has been considered intensive lipid-lowering therapy. Identification of optimal lipid targets and increased efforts to achieve those targets may help reduce the cardiovascular risk that remains despite lipid-lowering therapy that is currently considered adequate or even aggressive.", 
    "128": "Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). We evaluated the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin in patients with dyslipidemia associated with CRF who were undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Thirty-five patients who were receiving HD were given atorvastatin (10 mg/d) for 3 months. Chylomicron (CM), light and dense very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and light and dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were separated by ultracentrifugation. Apolipoprotein (apo) B was measured by electroimmunoassay. Mean LDL particle diameter was measured by gradient gel electrophoresis. Atorvastatin therapy reduced LDL-cholesterol (C) by 36% and remnant-like particle (RLP)-C by 58%. Atorvastatin significantly reduced apo B, apo CIII, and apo E in VLDL by 40% to 46% and IDL-apo B by 66%. Atorvastatin also significantly reduced cholesterol in CM, light VLDL, and dense VLDL without consistently affecting triglyceride (TG) in these lipoproteins. Atorvastatin similarly reduced both light and dense LDL-apo B by 38%. LDL particle size in the HD patients significantly increased during atorvastatin treatment from 25.7 +/- 0.4 to 26.2 +/- 0.6 nm. High sensitive C-reactive protein (HS-CRP) was halved by atorvastatin decreasing from 0.08 +/- 0.05 to 0.04 +/- 0.03 mg/dL. Atorvastatin treatment did not affect the creatinine kinase level, and no classical adverse effects were observed during the study. These results suggest that atorvastatin is safe and effective for the management of dyslipidemia in patients with CFR who are receiving HD, which may help to suppress the development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "129": "Statins are the preferred drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and fibrates for hypertriglyceridemia. In patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, monotherapy with one of these agents may not be effective and combined treatment may be preferable.", 
    "130": "To compare retrospectively the efficacy and safety of combined statin-fibrate treatment in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia in whom previous monotherapy with one of these agents occurred ineffective.", 
    "131": "The initial study group consisted of 327 patients who received micronised fenofibrate and 93 patients who received simvastatin for 12 months. Both agents caused significant changes in lipid profile. Following fibrate therapy, total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels decreased by 27.9%, 28.2% and 58%, respectively, and following simvastatin therapy by 33.6%, 42.8% and 37.5%, respectively. The HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) level increased after fenofibrate by 14.8% and remained unchanged following simvastatin therapy. The TC/HDL-C ratio decreased following fenofibrate by 35.6%, and following simvastatin by 35.3%. In some patients the required reduction in lipid parameters was not achieved fenofibrate or simvastatin. Subsequently, 93 patients underwent combined therapy by adding a second agent (simvastatin in a dose of 20 mg/day or fenofibrate in a dose of 200 mg per day) which was continued for another 12 months. The addition of simvastatin to fenofibrate decreased TC, LDL-C and TG levels by 35.5%, 42.1% and 59.6%, respectively in comparison to before treatment volumes. HDL-C level was increased by 11.1%, and TC/HDL-C ratio decreased by 45.3%. The addition of fenofibrate to simvastatin decreased TC, LDL-C and TG levels by 39.3%, 48.9% and 51,6%, respectively. HDL-C level was increased by 13.4%, and TC/HDL-C ratio decreased by 49.3%. No clinical side effects nor an increase in the transaminase levels, requiring termination of the treatment, were observed.", 
    "132": "Combined therapy with 20 mg of simvastatin and 200 mg of micronised fenofibrate is highly effective and safe in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.", 
    "133": "C-reactive protein is considered a risk factor for coronary artery disease. In addition to its lipid-lowering properties, statin decreases the level of C-reactive protein. Abrupt cessation of statin therapy during treatment could increase the incidence of cardiac events in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease. The changes of C-reactive protein after withdrawal of statin therapy are still unknown.", 
    "134": "Twenty patients with hyperlipidemia received statin (atorvastatin, 10 mg/day) therapy for 3 months. The levels of lipid profiles and C-reactive protein were assessed before receiving the statin therapy, immediately after 3 months of therapy, and on the 3 consecutive days after withdrawal of statin treatment.", 
    "135": "After 3 months of statin therapy, the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol), and C-reactive protein were significantly reduced (264.94 +/- 16.23 vs. 183.44 +/- 16.34 mg/dl, 183.17 +/- 34.56 vs. 122.00 +/- 17.66 mg/dl, and 2,309.00 +/- 437.85 vs. 1,257.95 +/- 207.99 ng/ml, respectively). The level of C-reactive protein increased on the second day after withdrawal of statin therapy (2,590.14 +/- 1,045.05 vs. 1,257.95 +/- 207.99 ng/ml); however, the total cholesterol and LDL-chol did not increase during the 3-day period after withdrawal of statin therapy.", 
    "136": "The increase in the level of C-reactive protein after withdrawal of statin therapy may be a contributing factor to the increased incidence of cardiac events in patients who have abruptly stopped statin therapy.", 
    "137": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of three hypolipidemic agents in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease associated with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "138": "Patients with dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIb), asymptomatic persistent transaminasemia lasting 24 weeks, and evidence of hepatic fat infiltration on ultrasonography and liver biopsy were studied. Those with predominant hypertriglyceridemia received omega-3 fatty acids (5 mL thrice daily) (Group A), those with predominant hypercholesterolemia received atorvastatin 20 mg/daily (Group B), and overweight patients received orlistat 120 mg thrice daily before meals (Group C). After 24 weeks of treatment, serum transaminase and lipid levels and liver ultrasonography were repeated.", 
    "139": "Serum transaminase levels decreased significantly (p< 0.001) in all groups but the decrease was more marked in Group C (AST 75 [16] to 31 [7] IU/L; ALT 120 [38] to 41 [10] IU/L) than in Group A (AST 70 [14] to 41 [6]; ALT 110 [20] to 68 [12]) or Group B (AST 68 [13] to 46 [9]; ALT 115 [22] to 76.6 [13]). After treatment, ultrasonography showed resolution of fatty liver in 35% of patients in Group A, 61% in Group B, and in 86% in Group C (p< 0.001, Group C vs. A).", 
    "140": "A decline in transaminase levels and normalization of ultrasonographic evidence of fatty liver were observed on treatment with omega-3 fatty acids in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, with atorvastatin in those with hypercholesterolemia, and orlistat in overweight patients with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "141": "To prospectively assess the 4-year progression rate of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in patients with clinically stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with multi-detector row computed tomography (CT).", 
    "142": "The study group consisted of 382 consecutive patients. All underwent baseline dual-sector spiral CT, and CT was repeated at 2 and 4 years later. Progression of CAC was assessed with measurement of the increase in total calcium score (TCS) and with repeated-measures analysis and multivariate linear regression models. Logistic regression model was used to predict incidence of new lesions.", 
    "143": "Eighty-seven percent (333 of 382) of the study group were men, with mean age of 65 years +/- 11, and 13% (49 of 382) were women, with mean age of 68 years +/- 11. The average TCS increased after 4 years by sixfold from baseline in the 1st quartile, and by four-, two- and 1.5-fold in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quartiles of baseline TCS (P <.01), respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis included age; sex; natural logarithm of baseline TCS; history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, current smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and lipid-lowering therapy with cholesterol synthesis enzyme inhibitor (statin); and family history of premature CAD. Results demonstrated that natural logarithm of baseline TCS and history of current smoking were independent predictors of the 4th-year natural logarithm of TCS levels (R(2) = 0.85, P <.001). New lesions were diagnosed in 56 (15%) patients. History of statin therapy (odds ratio = 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16, 0.77; P <.01), age with an increment of 5 years (odds ratio = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.90; P =.01), and natural logarithm of baseline TCS (odds ratio = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.86; P <.01) were independent predictors for new calcific lesions during 4 years.", 
    "144": "Accelerated progression of CAC during 4 years was found in clinically stable patients with CAD.", 
    "145": "An 82 year old woman was admitted with worsening dyspnoea. Arterial blood gases were taken on air and revealed a pH of 7.39, with a partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) of 1.2 kPa, pO2 of 19.3 kPa, HCO3 of 13.8 mmol/litre, and base excess of -16.3 mmol/litre: a compensated metabolic acidosis with hyperventilation induced hypocapnia, which is known to be a feature of lactic acidosis. There was also an increased anion gap ((Na140 + K4.0) - (Cl 106 + HCO3 13.8) = 24.2 mEq/litre (reference range, 7-16)), consistent with unmeasured cation. Lactate was measured and found to be raised at 3.33 mmol/litre (reference range, 0.9-1.7). After exclusion of common causes of lactic acidosis Atorvastatin was stopped and her acid-base balance returned to normal. Subsequently, thiamine was also shown to be deficient. The acidosis was thought to have been the result of a mitochondrial defect caused by a deficiency of two cofactors, namely: ubiquinone (as a result of inhibition by statin) and thiamine (as a result of dietary deficiency).", 
    "146": "Mechanisms of thrombosis induced by antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies include up-regulation of tissue factor (TF) expression on endothelial cells (ECs). Statins have been shown to reduce levels of TF induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on ECs. In a recent study, fluvastatin inhibited thrombogenic and proinflammatory properties of aPL antibodies in in vivo models. The aim of this study was to determine whether fluvastatin has an effect on aPL-induced expression of TF on ECs.", 
    "147": "IgGs were purified from four patients with APS (IgG-APS) and from control sera (IgG-NHS). Cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with IgG-APS or IgG-NHS or with medium alone or with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), as a positive control. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with fluvastatin (2.5, 5 or 10 micro m) with and without mevalonate (100 micro m). TF expression on HUVECs was measured by ELISA.", 
    "148": "PMA and the four IgG-APS preparations increased the expression of TF on EC significantly (4.9-, 2.4-, 4.2-, 3.5- and 3.1-fold, respectively), in a dose-dependent fashion. Fluvastatin (10 micro m) inhibited the effects of PMA and the four IgG-APS on TF expression by 70, 47, 65, 22 and 68%, respectively, and this effect was dose-dependent. Mevalonate (100 micro m) completely abrogated the inhibitory effects of fluvastatin on TF expression induced by aPL.", 
    "149": "Because of the suggested pathogenic role of aPL on induction of TF on ECs, our data provide a rationale for using statins as a therapeutic tool in treatment of thrombosis in APS.", 
    "150": "Cyclophosphamide has transformed the outcome of ANCA-associated vasculitis, but it is highly toxic. Recent studies have suggested that pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide (pCyc) is an effective alternative with less complications, but may lead to an increased rate of relapse. However, these studies used relatively short courses of treatment with cyclophosphamide. In this study we used a prolonged course of low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide for 18-24 months for ANCA-associated vasculitis, evaluated the effectiveness of pCyc and analysed the outcome of a prolonged treatment on the rate of relapse.", 
    "151": "A retrospective analysis of all the patients treated with pCyc from 1995 to 2002 was performed.", 
    "152": "Thirty-seven patients were followed for an average of 38 months. Thirty-four of 37 patients (91.9%) achieved complete remission at 3 months. Eight (21%) episodes of relapse occurred in 7 patients. The cyclophosphamide was well tolerated with a low rate of infections (18.9%) and 1 death (2.7%) due to sepsis whilst on cyclophosphamide.", 
    "153": "In this study, pCyc was effective in achieving rapid remission and had a low complication rate. If prolonged, this treatment may reduce the rate of relapse.", 
    "154": "Accumulating evidence suggests that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors have many biological effects beyond reducing cholesterol synthesis. In a mouse model of renal interstitial fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction, fluvastatin, one of the lipophilic hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, was shown to ameliorate fibrosis.", 
    "155": "In the present study, we examined the direct effects of fluvastatin on proliferation, matrix and growth factor production by rat kidney fibroblasts (NRK-49F cells).", 
    "156": "Treatment with fluvastatin reduced proliferation of NRK-49F cells in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not farnesyl pyrophosphate to the culture medium almost completely abolished the effect of fluvastatin. Moreover, fluvastatin treatment decreased the expression of activated Rho in NRK-49F cells suggesting that fluvastatin may decrease cell growth through blocking the activation of Rho. The majority of fluvastatin-treated cells were arrested at the G1 phase, associated with down-regulation of cyclin A and up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1, indicating that cell cycle modulation is an important mechanism. Fluvastatin significantly decreased messenger RNA expression of type III collagen and connective tissue growth factor.", 
    "157": "Taken together, it is suggested that fluvastatin may prevent tubulointerstitial fibrosis in a variety of progressive renal diseases by inhibiting proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts and their matrix synthesis.", 
    "158": "To compare the cholesterol-lowering efficacy and other metabolic effects of plant sterol and stanol esters, both of which are commonly used in the dietary management of hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "159": "The cholesterol-lowering efficacy of equivalent intakes of sterol and stanol esters and of different intakes of stanol esters were compared at 1 and 2 months, both in normal subjects and treated patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Systemic effects were assessed by measuring serum levels of plant sterols and of lathosterol and 7alpha-hydroxy-cholestenone, indices of sterol absorption and of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis respectively. There were no significant differences during the study between 1.6g daily of sterol and stanol esters in reducing total cholesterol (by 3-7%) or low density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 4-8%), nor between 1.6 and 2.6 g daily of stanol. However, the cholesterol-lowering effect of plant sterol esters was attenuated between 1 and 2 months. This was accompanied by increased serum plant sterols and decreased levels of 7alpha-hydroxy-cholestenone, especially in statin-treated hypercholesterolaemic patients not taking bile acid sequestrants.", 
    "160": "These findings suggest that absorption of dietary plant sterols suppressed bile acid synthesis, thereby diminishing their cholesterol-lowering efficacy. In contrast, plant stanols reduced plant sterol absorption and maintained their cholesterol-lowering efficacy."
