This update was based on a systematic review of the evidence and replaces the previous guidelines from 2002 that were widely accepted and implemented in clinical practice. The new cholesterol treatment guideline emphasizes matching the intensity of statin treatment to the level of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and replaces the old paradigm of pursuing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The new guideline also emphasizes the primacy of the evidence base for statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction and lists several patient groups that will not benefit from statin treatment despite their high cardiovascular risk, such as those with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV) and patients undergoing hemodialysis. The guideline has been received with mixed reviews and significant controversy. Because of the evidence-based nature of the guideline, there is room for several questions and uncertainties on when and how to use lipid-lowering therapy in clinical practice. The goal of the Mayo Clinic Task Force in the assessment, interpretation, and expansion of the ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guideline is to address gaps in information and some of the controversial aspects of the newly released cholesterol management guideline using additional sources of evidence and expert opinion as needed to guide clinicians on key aspects of ASCVD risk reduction.", 
    "1": "The recently published American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for cardiovascular risk assessment provide equations to estimate the 10-year and lifetime atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in African Americans and non-Hispanic whites, include stroke as an adverse cardiovascular outcome, and emphasize shared decision making. The guidelines provide a valuable framework that can be adapted on the basis of clinical judgment and individual/institutional expertise. In this review, we provide a perspective on the new guidelines, highlighting what is new, what is controversial, and potential adaptations. We recommend obtaining family history of ASCVD at the time of estimating ASCVD risk and consideration of imaging to assess subclinical disease burden in patients at intermediate risk. In addition to the adjuncts for ASCVD risk estimation recommended in the guidelines, measures that may be useful in refining risk estimates include carotid ultrasonography, aortic pulse wave velocity, and serum lipoprotein(a) levels. Finally, we stress the need for research efforts to improve assessment of ASCVD risk given the suboptimal performance of available risk algorithms and suggest potential future directions in this regard.",

    "3": "In the study, 60 patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective noncardiac surgery were randomly divided into intensive lipid modulation group (n = 30) and conventional group (n = 30). In intensive lipid modulation group, the patients were given atorvastatin 40 mg every night before surgery, 80 mg 12 h before surgery, and 40 mg 2 h before surgery, and 40 mg every night after noncardiac surgery. In conventional group, the patients were given atorvastatin 20 mg every night before surgery and also after the surgery. The occurrence of perioperative major adverse cardiac events (including sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, unplanned revascularization) were compared in the two groups. Preoperative and 48 h postoperative changes of lipid levels and inflammatory markers were also compared in the two groups.", 
    "4": "In conventional group, one patient suffered myocardial infarction with acute anterior ST-segment elevation and was given emergency left anterior descending artery interventional reperfusion therapy, and 7 patients suffered asymptomatic myocardial infarction. In intensive lipid modulation group, one patient suffered asymptomatic myocardial infarction, and the incidence rate of perioperative acute myocardial infarction reduced significantly compared with conventional group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in preoperative and postoperative changes of lipid levels in the two groups (P > 0.05), and compared with conventional group, there was significantly lower levels of inflammatory markers in intensive lipid modulation group (P < 0.05).", 
    "5": "The intensive lipid modulation group significantly reduced the incidence of perioperative major adverse cardiac events especially asymptomatic myocardial infarction, and the inhibition of the inflammatory response may be one of the protective mechanisms, which still needs to be further confirmed by large multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials.",

The influence of lovastatin on miR-21 under normal and pro-inflammatory conditions was tested after being added to the cell culture mixture for 24 hours. Conditional gene function of two predicted cardiovascular system relevant downstream targets of miR-21, protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3A (PPP1R3A) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), were analyzed with immunoblotting.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of short-term intensive atorvastatin (IA) therapy on vascular endothelial function and explore the possible mechanisms that may help to explain the clinical benefits from short-term intensive statin therapy.", 
    "15": "After exposure to high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks, the animals were, respectively, treated with IA or low-dose atorvastatin (LA) for 5 days. Blood lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation function were, respectively, measured. mRNA and protein expression of CRP, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) were also evaluated in pericarotid adipose tissue (PCAT) and cultured adipocytes.", 
    "16": "HFD increased serum inflammatory factor levels; induced significant hyperlipidemia and endothelial dysfunction, including imbalance between NO and ET-1; enhanced inflammatory factors and 5-LO expression; and promoted macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue. Five-day IA therapy could significantly decrease serum inflammatory factor levels and their expression in PCAT; restore the balance between NO and ET-1; and improve endothelial function and macrophage infiltration without significant changes in blood lipids. However, all of the above were not observed in LA therapy. In vitro experiment found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced the expression of inflammatory factors and 5-LO in cultured adipocytes, which could be attenuated by short-time (6 hours) treatment of high-dose (5 \u00b5mol/L) but not low-dose (0.5 \u00b5mol/L) atorvastatin. In addition, inhibiting 5-LO by Cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-\u03b1-cyanocinnamate (CDC, a potent and direct 5-LO inhibitor) could significantly downregulate the above-mentioned gene expression in LPS-treated adipocytes.",

    "18": "Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is a frequent disorder associated with premature coronary artery disease. It is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, although there is not a unique gene involved. The diagnosis is performed using clinical criteria, and variability in lipid phenotype and family history of hyperlipidemia are necessaries. Frequently, the disorder is associated with type2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and central obesity. Patients with FCH are considered as high cardiovascular risk and the lipid target is an LDL-cholesterol <100mg/dL, and <70mg/dL if cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes are present. Patients with FCH require lipid lowering treatment using potent statins and sometimes, combined lipid-lowering treatment. Identification and management of other cardiovascular risk factors as type 2 diabetes and hypertension are fundamental to reduce cardiovascular disease burden. This document gives recommendations for the diagnosis and global treatment of patients with FCH directed to specialists and general practitioners.", 
    "19": "The administration of statins seems to be a promising new avenue in the treatment of patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), though patients suffering from severe MDD remain unstudied in this respect. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate, in a randomized double-blind clinical trial, the influence of adjuvant atorvastatin on symptoms of depression in patients with MDD.", 
    "20": "A total of 60 patients suffering from MDD (mean age: 32.25 years; 53% males) received a standard medication of 40 mg/d citalopram. Next, patients were randomly assigned either to the atorvastatin group (20 mg/d) or to the placebo group. Blood lipid values were assessed at baseline and on completion of the study 12 weeks later. Experts rated depressive symptoms via Hamilton Depression Rating Scales (HDRS) at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 weeks later.", 
    "21": "HDRS scores decreased over time; the significant Time by Group interaction showed that symptoms of depression decreased more in the atorvastatin than in the placebo group. Compared to the placebo group, in the atorvastatin group cholesterol, triglyceride, and Low Density Lipids (LDL) significantly decreased, and High Density Lipids (HDL) significantly increased over time. HDRS scores and blood lipid values were generally not associated.", 
    "22": "The pattern of results suggests that adjuvant atorvastatin favorably influences symptoms of depression among patients with severe MDD. Given that after 12 weeks of monotherapy and adjuvant atorvastatin patients were still moderately to severely depressed, more powerful treatment algorithms such as augmentation and change of medication are highly recommended.",

    "24": "65 elderly patients with symptomatic severe stenosis of internal carotid artery were recruited into 2 groups: the pharmacotherapy group (n=29) and the CAS group (n=36). Before surgery and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery, Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) was used for the evaluation of cognition and WHOQOL-BREF was used for the assessment of quality of life.", 
    "25": "At 12 months after surgery, total MoCA score and WHOQOL-BREF score in the pharmacotherapy group was significantly reduced when compared with those before surgery (P<0.05). In the CAS group, the total MoCA score, scores of attention and delayed recall, and WHOQOL-BREF score increased significantly at different time points after surgery when compared with those before surgery (P<0.05). Moreover, in CAS group, the MoCA score and WHOQOL-BREF markedly increased gradually over time (P<0.05). Compared with the pharmacotherapy group, cognition and quality of life in the CAS group were improved dramatically during the follow-up period (P<0.05).",

Recommendations without a direct empirical clinical trial basis tend to be controversial. Recommendations with and without a direct empirical clinical trial basis are mixed in the same text - while at the same time (rightfully) rejecting previous recommendations, also without a direct empirical clinical trial basis.", 
    "28": "The atomic electrostatic potentials calculated by the CHELPG method have been shown to be sensitive indicators of the gas phase and solution properties of the statins. Solvation free energies in water, n-octanol and n-octane have been determined using the SMD solvent model. The percentage hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (or lipophilicity) of the statins in solution have been determined using (a) the differences in solvation free energies between n-octanol and n-octane as a measure of hydrophilicity, and the solvation energy in octane as a measure of hydrophobicity (b) the sum of the atomic electrostatic charges on the hydrogen bonding and polar bonding nuclei of the common pharmacophore combined with a solvent measure of hydrophobicity, and (c) using the buried surface areas after statin binding to HMGCR to calculate the hydrophobicity of the bound statins. The data suggests that clinical definitions of statins as either \"hydrophilic\" or \"lipophilic\" based on experimental partition coefficients are misleading. An estimate of the binding energy between rosuvastatin and HMGCR has been made using: (a) a coulombic electrostatic interaction model, (b) the calculated desolvation and resolvation of the statin in water, and (c) the first shell transfer solvation energy as a proxy for the restructuring of the water molecules immediately adjacent to the active binding site of HMGCR prior to binding. Desolvation and resolvation of the statins before and after binding to HMGCR are major determinants of the energetics of the binding process. An analysis of the amphiphilic nature of lovastatin anion, acid and lactone and fluvastatin anion and their abilities to cross the blood brain barrier has indicated that this process may be dominated by desolvation and resolvation effects, rather than the statin molecular size or statin-lipid interactions within the bilayer. The ionization energy and electron affinity of the statins are sensitive physical indicators of the ease that the various statins can undergo endogenous oxidative metabolism. The absolute chemical hardness is also an indicator of the stability of the statins, and may be a useful indicator for drug design.", 
    "29": "Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is considered to be caused by the binding of NMO-IgG to aquaporin 4 (AQP4) on astrocytes, which initiates complement-dependent cytotoxicity. AQP4 has two isoforms, i.e., M1 and M23. AQP4 is considered to form heterotetramers containing both isoforms in vivo. Most of the previous studies were performed using either one of the isoforms expressing cell lines. In this study, we generated a fluorescent epitope-tagged AQP4 M1 and M23 co-expressing astrocyte cell line and examined the subcellular targeting of AQP4. In this cell line, AQP4 was targeted mostly to membrane lipid rafts fraction evidenced by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation followed by Western blotting with anti-AQP4 antibody. Cholesterol depletion with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin or simvastatin resulted in the dislocation (relocation) of AQP4 from lipid rafts to non-rafts fraction of the membrane and AQP4 was not internalized intracellularly. This change in the localization of AQP4 on membrane significantly reduced complement-dependent cytotoxic effects of NMO-IgG obtained from patients with NMO without affecting AQP4 orthogonal arrays. Thus, these data strongly suggest that the targeting of AQP4 in the lipid rafts is closely related to the pathogenic effects of NMO-IgG.", 
    "30": "The kidney is a homeostatic organ required for waste excretion and reabsorption of water, salts and other macromolecules. To this end, a complex series of developmental steps ensures the formation of a correctly patterned and properly proportioned organ. While previous studies have mainly focused on the individual signaling pathways, the formation of higher order receptor complexes in lipid rafts is an equally important aspect. These membrane platforms are characterized by differences in local lipid and protein compositions. Indeed, the cells in the Xenopus pronephric kidney were positive for the lipid raft markers ganglioside GM1 and Caveolin-1. To specifically interfere with lipid raft function in vivo, we focused on the Sterol Carrier Protein 2 (scp2), a multifunctional protein that is an important player in remodeling lipid raft composition. In Xenopus, scp2 mRNA was strongly expressed in differentiated epithelial structures of the pronephric kidney. Knockdown of scp2 did not interfere with the patterning of the kidney along its proximo-distal axis, but dramatically decreased the size of the kidney, in particular the proximal tubules. This phenotype was accompanied by a reduction of lipid rafts, but was independent of the peroxisomal or transcriptional activities of scp2. Finally, disrupting lipid micro-domains by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis using Mevinolin phenocopied the defects seen in scp2 morphants. Together these data underscore the importance for localized signaling platforms in the proper formation of the Xenopus kidney.",

The primary endpoint was the occurrence of an ischemic event (any SCA, stroke or transient ischemic attack), heart failure, or death. A clinical risk scale derived from the LIPID study significantly predicted the development of the primary endpoint, with an area under the ROC curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic) of 0.642 (0.579 to 0.705); P<0.001. A composite score was developed by adding the scores of the LIPID and scale decile levels of MCP -1, galectin -3 and NT-proBNP. The predictive value improved with an area under the curve of 0.744 (0.684 to 0.805); P<0.001 (P=0.022 for comparison).

Statins have also been shown to abrogate telomere-attributed cardiovascular risk. The goal of our study was to explore a potential effect of atorvastatin on telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and T-lymphocytes (T cells).", 
    "36": "Treatment with pharmacologically relevant concentrations (0.1-0.3\u00a0\u03bcM) of atorvastatin resulted in a 6-fold increase of telomerase activity (TA) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in human and mouse PBMCs and CD4 T cells, translating into moderate proliferation of T lymphocytes. In contrast, high doses of atorvastatin (2-5\u00a0\u03bcM) or the addition of LDL cholesterol completely inhibited proliferation, thereby abrogating telomerase activity. The proliferative effect of atorvastatin was ablated by the absense of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). Using transgenic GFP-mTert reporter mice, we observed a decrease in telomerase-positive lymphocytes from 30% to 15% during the first 5 months of age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). This suggests that the decrease in immune cell turnover during normal development and maturation is mirrored by a reduction in telomerase activity in lymphocytes in-vivo.",

    "38": "For a number of years, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was known for its key role in mitochondrial bioenergetics; later studies demonstrated its presence in other subcellular fractions and in blood plasma, and extensively investigated its antioxidant role. These 2 functions constitute the basis for supporting the clinical use of CoQ10. Also, at the inner mitochondrial membrane level, CoQ10 is recognized as an obligatory cofactor for the function of uncoupling proteins and a modulator of the mitochondrial transition pore. Furthermore, recent data indicate that CoQ10 affects the expression of genes involved in human cell signaling, metabolism and transport, and some of the effects of CoQ10 supplementation may be due to this property. CoQ10 deficiencies are due to autosomal recessive mutations, mitochondrial diseases, aging-related oxidative stress and carcinogenesis processes, and also statin treatment. Many neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cancer, and muscular and cardiovascular diseases have been associated with low CoQ10 levels as well as different ataxias and encephalomyopathies. CoQ10 treatment does not cause serious adverse effects in humans and new formulations have been developed that increase CoQ10 absorption and tissue distribution. Oral administration of CoQ10 is a frequent antioxidant strategy in many diseases that may provide a significant symptomatic benefit.", 
    "39": "Reduced coronary flow reserve (CFR), an indicator of coronary microvascular dysfunction, is seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and predicts cardiac mortality. Since aldosterone plays a key role in vascular injury, the aim of this study was to determine whether mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade improves CFR in individuals with T2DM. Sixty-four men and women with well-controlled diabetes on chronic ACE inhibition (enalapril 20 mg/day) were randomized to add-on therapy of spironolactone 25 mg, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg, or placebo for 6 months. CFR was assessed by cardiac positron emission tomography at baseline and at the end of treatment. There were significant and similar decreases in systolic blood pressure with spironolactone and HCTZ but not with placebo. CFR improved with treatment in the spironolactone group as compared with the HCTZ group and with the combined HCTZ and placebo groups. The increase in CFR with spironolactone remained significant after controlling for baseline CFR, change in BMI, race, and statin use. Treatment with spironolactone improved coronary microvascular function, raising the possibility that MR blockade could have beneficial effects in preventing cardiovascular disease in patients with T2DM.",

To determine the effects of pravastatin on endothelial function, high-frequency ultrasound was performed before the start of the study and 6 months after pravastatin therapy. The parameters measured were brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), non-flow mediated dilation (NMD), and carotid artery stiffness index (SI).

Prior to PCI, 8023 (33.9%) patients were receiving OMT, 11 891 (50.2%) were on suboptimal therapy, and 3766 (15.9%) were not prescribed any medications of interest. There was significant improvement in medical therapy following PCI (OMT: 11 149 [47.1%], suboptimal therapy: 11 591 [48.9%], and none: 940 [4.0%], P<0.001). Utilization rate of OMT reduced significantly after the publication of COURAGE (34.9% before versus 32.8% after, P<0.001). Similarly, the rate of OMT following PCI was lower in the period after publication of COURAGE (47.3% before versus 46.9% after, P<0.001).",

Docetaxel modestly increases survival, yet results in frequent occurrence of side effects and resistant disease. An alternate chemotherapy with greater efficacy and minimal side effects is needed. Acquisition of metabolic aberrations promoting increased survival and metastasis in CRPC cells includes constitutive activation of Akt, loss of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity due to Ser-485/491 phosphorylation, and overexpression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR). We report that combination of simvastatin and metformin, within pharmacologic dose range (500 nmol/L to 4 \u03bcmol/L simvastatin and 250 \u03bcmol/L to 2 mmol/L metformin), significantly and synergistically reduces C4-2B3/B4 CRPC cell viability and metastatic properties, with minimal adverse effects on normal prostate epithelial cells. Combination of simvastatin and metformin decreased Akt Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation and AMPK\u03b1 Ser-485/491 phosphorylation; increased Thr-172 phosphorylation and AMPK\u03b1 activity, as assessed by increased Ser-79 and Ser-872 phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase and HMG-CoAR, respectively; decreased HMG-CoAR activity; and reduced total cellular cholesterol and its synthesis in both cell lines. Studies of C4-2B4 orthotopic NCr-nu/nu mice further demonstrated that combination of simvastatin and metformin (3.5-7.0 \u03bcg/g body weight simvastatin and 175-350 \u03bcg/g body weight metformin) daily by oral gavage over a 9-week period significantly inhibited primary ventral prostate tumor formation, cachexia, bone metastasis, and biochemical failure more effectively than 24 \u03bcg/g body weight docetaxel intraperitoneally injected every 3 weeks, 7.0 \u03bcg/g/day simvastatin, or 350 \u03bcg/g/day metformin treatment alone, with significantly less toxicity and mortality than docetaxel, establishing combination of simvastatin and metformin as a promising chemotherapeutic alternative for metastatic CRPC.", 
    "63": "The chemical structure of lipoprotein (a) is similar to that of LDL, from which it differs due to the presence of apolipoprotein (a) bound to apo B100 via one disulfide bridge. Lipoprotein (a) is synthesized in the liver and its plasma concentration, which can be determined by use of monoclonal antibody-based methods, ranges from < 1 mg to > 1,000 mg/dL. Lipoprotein (a) levels over 20-30 mg/dL are associated with a two-fold risk of developing coronary artery disease. Usually, black subjects have higher lipoprotein (a) levels that, differently from Caucasians and Orientals, are not related to coronary artery disease. However, the risk of black subjects must be considered. Sex and age have little influence on lipoprotein (a) levels. Lipoprotein (a) homology with plasminogen might lead to interference with the fibrinolytic cascade, accounting for an atherogenic mechanism of that lipoprotein. Nevertheless, direct deposition of lipoprotein (a) on arterial wall is also a possible mechanism, lipoprotein (a) being more prone to oxidation than LDL. Most prospective studies have confirmed lipoprotein (a) as a predisposing factor to atherosclerosis. Statin treatment does not lower lipoprotein (a) levels, differently from niacin and ezetimibe, which tend to reduce lipoprotein (a), although confirmation of ezetimibe effects is pending. The reduction in lipoprotein (a) concentrations has not been demonstrated to reduce the risk for coronary artery disease. Whenever higher lipoprotein (a) concentrations are found, and in the absence of more effective and well-tolerated drugs, a more strict and vigorous control of the other coronary artery disease risk factors should be sought.",

After adjustment for covariates, baseline levels of TC and LDL-C influenced more than 30% of the efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy (p < 0.001), regardless of sex. Myalgia [with or without changes in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels] occurred more frequently in women (25.9%; p = 0.002), whereas an increase in CPK and/or abnormal liver function was more frequent in in men (17.9%; p = 0.017).",

Amongst non-diabetics with <5% risk at baseline, 35% reached or exceeded 5% risk in five years (5% reached or exceed the 7.5% risk) with No Change and 9% reached or exceeded 5% risk in five years (none reached 7.5% risk) with Reduced Risk Profile; furthermore, 94% of the non-diabetic cohort with baseline risk between 3.5%-5% would exceed the 5% and/or 7.5% boundary limit with No Change.

    "88": "Chronic inflammation in the kidneys and vascular wall is a major contributor to hypertension. However, the stimuli and cellular mechanisms responsible for such inflammatory responses remain poorly defined. Inflammasomes are crucial initiators of sterile inflammation in other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout. These pattern recognition receptors detect host-derived danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as microcrystals and reactive oxygen species, and respond by inducing activation of caspase-1. Caspase-1 then processes the cytokines pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into their active forms thus triggering inflammation. While IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are known to be elevated in hypertensive patients, no studies have examined whether this occurs downstream of inflammasome activation or whether inhibition of inflammasome and/or IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 signalling prevents hypertension. In this review, we will discuss some known actions of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 on leukocyte and vessel wall function that could potentially underlie a prohypertensive role for these cytokines. We will describe the major classes of inflammasome-activating DAMPs and present evidence that at least some of these are elevated in the setting of hypertension. Finally, we will provide information on drugs that are currently used to inhibit inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 signalling and how these might ultimately be used as therapeutic agents for the clinical management of hypertension.",

The reduction in Hcy levels in carriers of the T allele was -20.3% compared with -9.4% in patients with the CC genotype. Importantly, before treatment, nitrite levels were significantly higher in patients with the CC genotype compared with T allele carriers, whereas after treatment these levels were similar between groups.

We tested the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of atorvastatin may be partly mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (PI3K/Akt/Nrf 2) pathway via the attenuation of DC maturation, thus reducing the inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. This study showed that angiotensin 2 (Ang 2) induced the maturation of DCs, stimulated CD83, CD40, CD80, and CD86 expression, and increased the secretion of IL-12p70, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1. These effects were suppressed by atorvastatin. Atorvastatin also lowered the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), counteracting their initial increases in response to Ang 2 stimulation. Atorvastatin activated Nrf 2 via the PI3K/Akt pathway and thereby promoted Nrf 2 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), a process that was reversed by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Therefore, the regulation of Nrf 2 expression by the PI3K/Akt pathway plays an important role in the regulation of the statin-mediated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses in DCs.",

Blockade of GGylation enhanced phosphorylation of Mst1/2 and Lats1, and inhibited YAP and TAZ activity and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway-dependent transcription. The effect of GGylation blockade on inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation and migration is dependent on the Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling, in which YAP appears to regulate cell proliferation and TAZ to regulate cell migration. Furthermore, GGylation-dependent cell proliferation is correlated with the activity of YAP/TAZ in breast cancer cells. Finally, G\u03b3 and RhoA are the GGylated proteins that may transduce GGylation signals to the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway.

A pravastatin pharmacokinetic model was constructed and the simulated hepatic pravastatin concentration was used to modulate the reaction rate constant of hepatic free cholesterol synthesis in the PBK model. The integrated model was then used to predict plasma cholesterol concentrations as a function of pravastatin dose. Predicted versus observed values at 40 mg/d pravastatin were 15 versus 22 % reduction of total plasma cholesterol, and 10 versus 5.6 % increase of HDL cholesterol. A population of 7,609 virtual subjects was generated using a Monte Carlo approach, and the response to a 40 mg/d pravastatin dose was simulated for each subject. Linear regression analysis of the pravastatin response in this virtual population showed that hepatic and peripheral cholesterol synthesis had the largest regression coefficients for the non-HDL-C response. However, the modeling also showed that these processes alone did not suffice to predict non-HDL-C response to pravastatin, contradicting the hypothesis that people with high cholesterol synthesis rates are good statin responders.

Finally, (3)H-cholesteryl oleate-HDL was intravenously injected into all groups, blood samples were taken, and the count of (3)H-cholesterol was analyzed. Plasma (3)H-cholesteryl oleate-HDL changed similarly, and no differences in fractional catabolic rates were observed.",

    "180": "The American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on Practice Guidelines recently issued the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults. This new guideline endorses a paradigm shift in strategies for reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events by lowering blood cholesterol. Whereas previous guidelines focused on therapy to decrease low-density lipoprotein and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to specific target levels, the new guideline instead proposes implementation of cholesterol-lowering treatment using evidenced-based intensity of statin therapy without such targets. The guideline also provides a new risk estimator for primary prevention decisions, including stroke outcomes and data on African Americans, which will significantly increase the number of patients recommended for outcome-related benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The first section of this paper reviews the process by which the task force developed the new evidence-based guideline, the major findings and recommendations, and their implications. The second section primarily focuses on the question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered and on additional considerations in risk assessment.", 
    "181": "Low statin adherence and discontinuation of statins are common in patients with coronary heart disease. We hypothesized that low antihypertensive medication adherence would be associated with future statin discontinuation and low adherence in patients initiating statins. Using a 5% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries, we conducted a cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries initiating statins after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Antihypertensive medication adherence, defined using the average proportion of days covered across 5 classes during the 365 days before hospitalization, was categorized as \u226580% (high), 50% to <80% (medium), and <50% (low). Statin discontinuation was defined as failure to refill a statin within 365 days of hospital discharge, and low adherence was defined as proportion of days covered for statins <80%. In 2,695 Medicare beneficiaries who initiated statins after hospital discharge, 6.0%, 8.4%, and 14.5% with high, medium, and low antihypertensive medication adherence discontinued statins. After multivariable adjustment, the risk ratios (95% confidence interval) for statin discontinuation were 1.38 (0.98 to 1.95) and 2.41 (1.51 to 3.87) for beneficiaries with medium and low versus high antihypertensive medication adherence, respectively. In beneficiaries who did not discontinue statins, 36.2% had low statin adherence. Compared with high adherence, medium and low antihypertensive medication adherences were associated with multivariable adjusted risk ratios (95% confidence interval) for low statin adherence of 1.33 (1.14 to 1.55) and 1.62 (1.25 to 2.10), respectively. In conclusion, low antihypertensive medication adherence before initiating statins is associated with future statin discontinuation and low statin adherence.", 
    "182": "The molecular pharmacological effects of cytoflavin in patients with hypertensive encephalopathy (HE) and isolated systolic arterial hypertension (ISAH) have been investigated using the following methods: assessment of complaints, 24-hour arterial pressure monitoring, ultrasound diagnostics including echocardiography, measurement of lipid profiles and coagulograms, and molecular phenotyping by MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS. A combination of cytoflavin administration with standard therapy of HE and ISAH led to the most expressed return development of clinical symptoms, restoration of the hemodynamic, structural, and geometrical parameters of cardiovascular system, and normalization of the indices of lipid profiles and coagulograms in comparison to patients with HE and ISAH, which accepted only standard therapy. Molecular mechanisms of cytoflavin action have been revealed, which include control of the activity of cellular signaling pathways by means of intermolecular interactions. The optimized therapy of HE and ISAH is recommended for clinical application, which assumes a combined use of standard therapy and cytoflavin and provides a geroprotective action upon the cardiovascular system.",

Statin users of three years or more and serum cholesterol levels (SC) were assessed in 2408 men scheduled for prostate biopsy. SC was classified as normal (NSC: <200 mg/dL) or high (HSC: >200 mg/dL). High-grade PCa (HGPCa) was considered if the Gleason score was greater than 7. Statin users comprised 30.9% of those studied. The PCa detection rate was 31.2% of men on statins and 37% of non-statin users (p<0.006). The PCa detection rate was 26.3% in men with NSC and 40.6% in those with HSC (p<0.001). In the subset of NSC men, the PCa rate was 26.5% for statin users and 26.2% for non-users (p=0.939), while in men with HSC, the PCa rate was 36.4% for statin users and 42.0% for non-statin users (p=0.063). The HGPCa rate was 41.8% for statin users and 32.5% for non-users (p=0.012). NSC men had a 53.8% rate of HGPCa, while the rate was only 27.6% in HSC men (p<0.001). NSC men on statins had an HGPCa rate of 70.2%, while non-statin users had a rate of 41.2% (p<0.001). The HGPCa rate for HSC men on statins was 18.8%, while the rate was 30.0% (p=0.011) for non-users. Logistic regression analysis suggested that serum cholesterol levels could serve as an independent predictor of PCa risk, OR 1.87 (95% CI 1.56-2.24) and HGPCa risk, OR 0.31 (95% CI 0.23-0.44), while statin usage could not. Statin treatment may prevent PCa detection through serum cholesterol-mediated mechanisms. A disturbing increase in the HGPCa rate was observed in statin users who normalized their serum cholesterol.", 
    "184": "Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a major feature of chronic kidney disease. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in rodents leads to the development of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis consistent with histopathological changes observed in advanced chronic kidney disease in humans. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of inhibiting angiotensin II receptors or Ras activation on early renal fibrotic changes induced by UUO. Animals either received angiotensin II or underwent UUO. UUO animals received either losartan, atorvastatin, and farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) L-744,832, or chaetomellic acid A (ChA). Levels of activated Ras, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-Akt, fibronectin, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin were subsequently quantified in renal tissue by ELISA, Western blot, and/or immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrate that administration of angiotensin II induces activation of the small GTPase Ras/Erk/Akt signaling system, suggesting an involvement of angiotensin II in the early obstruction-induced activation of renal Ras. Furthermore, upstream inhibition of Ras signalling by blocking either angiotensin AT1 type receptor or by inhibiting Ras prenylation (atorvastatin, FTI o ChA) reduced the activation of the Ras/Erk/Akt signaling system and decreased the early fibrotic response in the obstructed kidney. This study points out that pharmacological inhibition of Ras activation may hold promise as a future strategy in the prevention of renal fibrosis.",

Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors used primarily for hyperlidpidemia, have been studied for their antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. However, the effects of simvastatin on pemetrexed-induced apoptosis have not been investigated. In this study, we investigated whether combination treatment with pemetrexed and simvastatin potentiates the apoptotic activity above that is seen with either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC cells. We found that the combination of pemetrexed and simvastatin induced more extensive caspase-dependent apoptosis than either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma cells (MSTO-211) or NSCLC cells (A549). In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cells treated with both pemetrexed and simvastatin was markedly increased compared to cells treated with either pemetrexed or simvastatin alone. Combination treatment also increased the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increased cytosolic release of cytochrome\u00a0c, and altered expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) families of apoptosis related proteins. On the other hand, pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) prevented apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction by pemetrexed and simvastatin. In addition, Bim siRNA conferred protection against apoptosis induced by pemetrexed and simvastatin. These results suggest that combination of pemetrexed and simvastatin potentiates their apoptotic activity beyond that of either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer cells. This activity is mediated through ROS-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and Bim induction.",

Since statins can cause myalgias and myopathies, they could affect the duration or intensity of an exercise regimen. To determine the impact of statin use in adult masters swimmers, a survey was distributed to examine the association between swimming performance and statin usage in adult swimmers (\u226535 years). After excluding those with chronic diseases or taking drugs that reduce physical capacity, 749 swimmers (118 taking statins, 73 not taking statins to control elevated cholesterol and 558 controls) were included in a regression model to determine the factors significantly affecting the duration and intensity of swimming workouts. Age and gender were significantly (P \u2264 0.001) associated with the distance swam per 60 min. Younger, male swimmers completed more yards per 60-min workout. Use of statins was not significantly associated with yards swam per 60-min workout. Nor did statin usage affect the number of swim sessions per month or the length of swim session. Evidently, statins do not cause enough fatigue or pain in masters swimmers to require a decrease in the duration or intensity of workouts.",

Similarly, early pharmacological management can modulate the pathophysiological alterations after cardiac surgery, leading to an improvement in the early and long-term outcome. In this review, we will present recent advances in postcardiac surgery management, focusing on the pathophysiology of the perioperative period and on recent evidences in pharmacological and rehabilitative strategies.",

The most at-risk are a relatively well-defined population who were exposed as a consequence of their occupations. Although preventative agents investigated so far have not been promising, discovery of such an agent would have a significant benefit world-wide on healthcare costs and personal suffering. Statins are widely used for management of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular risk; they can induce apoptosis in mesothelioma cells and epidemiological data has linked their use to a lower incidence of cancer. We hypothesised that statins would inhibit the development of asbestos-induced mesothelioma in mice and humans. An autochthonous murine model of asbestos-induced mesothelioma was used to test this by providing atorvastatin daily in the feed at 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg. Continuous administration of atorvastatin did not alter the rate of disease development nor increase the length of time that mice survived. Latency to first symptoms of disease and disease progression were also unaffected. In a parallel study, the relationship between the use of statins and development of mesothelioma was investigated in asbestos-exposed humans. In a cohort of 1,738 asbestos exposed people living or working at a crocidolite mine site in Wittenoom, Western Australia, individuals who reported use of statins did not have a lower incidence of mesothelioma (HR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.44-2.29, p = 0.99). Some individuals reported use of both statins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors, and these people also did not have an altered risk of mesothelioma development (HR = 1.01; 95% CI = 0.61-1.67, p = 0.97).

Intraperitoneal injection was much better than oral administration in delaying glioblastoma growth. Following statin treatment, tumour cells were rescued by adding mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.

Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63-75, white females aged 71-75, African American males aged 66-75, and African American females aged 70-75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having \"statin deficiency,\" a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency \"statinopause.\" After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention.
