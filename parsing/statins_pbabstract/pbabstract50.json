    "0": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease that binds to low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDL-Rs), leading to their accelerated degradation and increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Therefore, PCSK9 levels play a critical role in cholesterol metabolism by reducing LDL-R levels and thus increasing levels of plasma LDL-C. Recently, investigational agents inhibiting PCSK9 have been shown to lower LDL-C and also, potentially, an important secondary target, lipoprotein(a). Therefore, several pharmaceutical companies have initiated drug-development programs that target PCSK9 and are built on a solid foundation of basic science, genetic studies, and epidemiological observations. PCSK9 inhibition with monoclonal antibodies demonstrated LDL-C lowering of up to 57% when the PCSK9 antibodies are used as monotherapy and up to 73% when added to background lipid-lowering therapy. In addition, long-term cardiovascular outcome studies are currently under way to confirm the longer term safety and efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors and to determine whether PCSK9 inhibition lowers the incidence of major cardiovascular events. PCSK9 inhibitors may provide safe and effective lipid-lowering therapy, especially for patients with inadequate LDL-C lowering on lipid-lowering treatments, those who are statin intolerant or have contraindications to statin therapy, and those with hereditary hypercholesterolemia/familial hypercholesterolemia and severely elevated LDL-C.", 
    "1": "Statin therapy improves lipid profiles and reduces vascular inflammation, but its effects on central arterial stiffness in type 2 diabetes are unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether statin therapy reduces central arterial stiffness, in a dose-dependent manner, in male patients with type 2 diabetes. Fifty-one patients ceased statin therapy for 6 weeks, followed by randomisation to either 10 or 80 mg of atorvastatin. At randomization, 3 and 12 months, central arterial stiffness was measured via carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), along with serum markers of vascular inflammation including high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). PWV decreased from 10.37 \u00b1 1.30 to 9.68 \u00b1 1.19 m/sec (p < 0.01 from baseline) at 3 months and 9.10 \u00b1 1.17 m/sec (p < 0.001 from baseline) at 12 months. hsCRP and OPG decreased significantly at 3 and 12 months. Reductions in PWV did not differ significantly between the groups. Baseline PWV and OPG values correlated strongly (r = 0.48, p < 0.01), as did their response to atorvastatin over 12 months (r = 0.36 delta-OPG and delta-PWV, p < 0.01). Atorvastatin therapy appeared to reduce central arterial stiffness in male type 2 diabetes, with no dose-dependent effect observed. The correlation observed between reductions in PWV and OPG suggests that atorvastatin reduces PWV via direct anti-inflammatory effects on the vasculature.", 
    "2": "Statins are widely used drugs to lower cholesterol levels and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, it has been reported that statins are associated with adverse side effects of skeletal myopathy. Statin treatment can impair mitochondrial function and induce apoptosis in skeletal muscle in both human and animal models. Ubiquinone plays an essential role in transferring electrons in the mitochondrial electron transfer chain for oxidative phosphorylation. However, statin treatment reduces ubiquinone levels in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, which may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis induced by statins may provide cellular and molecular mechanisms in skeletal myopathy. Exercise is the most effective therapy to prevent metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. However, whether exercise provides a benefit to or exacerbation of statin-induced myopathy in skeletal muscle remains poorly investigated. This review will briefly provide a comprehensive summary regarding the effects of statins on skeletal myopathy, and discuss the potential mechanisms of statin-induced myopathy and the role of exercise in statin-induced myopathy in skeletal muscle.",

Previous drug therapies and hospital admissions for cardiovascular reasons in the 12 months before hospitalization for MI, statin treatment and lipid levels during hospitalization, indication for statin treatment at hospital discharge, and adherence to statin treatment in the following 24 months using an integrated analysis of administrative databases and hospital case records were evaluated. Also, factors associated either positively or negatively with consistent acute and long-term use of this efficacy-proven therapy were evaluated.",

Of the 2,629 patients persistent with treatment during the follow-up, only 1,431 had an adherence to statins >80%. Either during the hospitalization or during the follow-up, the use of statins was negatively associated with older age and the presence of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Lipid levels were significantly higher in treated than in untreated patients, but did not contribute to adherence to treatment. An important factor in long-term adherence to statin treatment was a statin prescription at the time of hospital discharge.",

    "7": "Regulatory T cells play an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. GARP is a newly biological membrane molecule existed on activated Tregs, which is related to the release of TGF-\u03b2. The antiatherosclerosis effects of statins partly depend on their multiple immune modulatory potencies. In this paper, we present that atorvastatin could upregulate the expression of GARP and TGF-\u03b2 in CD4+ T cells and increase the numbers of CD4+LAP+ and CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in ApoE-/- mice. Also, we indicate that atorvastatin promotes the aggregation of GARP+ and Foxp3+ cells and secretory of the TGF-\u03b21 in atherosclerotic plaques. Furthermore, we prove that atorvastatin could delay the procession of atherosclerosis and improve the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. Interestingly, we report that inhibition of GARP distinctly inhibits the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin. We conclude that atorvastatin improves the inflammatory response in atherosclerosis partly by upregulating the expression of GARP on regulatory T cells.", 
    "8": "Simvastatin, which is widely used in the prevention and treatment of hyperlipidemia-associated diseases, has been reported to enhance the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in a model of retinal ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. However, the underlying mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effects of simvastatin on the retina have yet to be elucidated. In the present study, rats were treated with simvastatin or saline for 7 days prior to IR via ligation of the right cephalic artery. The results showed that simvastatin prevented the apoptosis of RGCs and cells in the inner nuclear layer. Furthermore, simvastatin regulated the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins. The expression levels of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2 were upregulated 4 and 24 h after IR in the simvastatin/IR group compared to those in the saline/IR group. Conversely, the levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax were downregulated in the simvastatin/IR group compared to those in the saline/IR group. Furthermore, the results of the present study showed for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that simvastatin decreased IR injury-induced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) expression in the retina. These findings strongly suggested that simvastatin inhibits apoptosis following IR-induced retinal injury by inhibition of the TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB pathway. The present study also provided a rationale for developing therapeutic methods to treat IR-induced retinal injury in the clinic.",

We investigated the prognostic value of statins in a large, pure cohort of prospectively recruited patients with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation, and being followed up in a dedicated cardiac clinic. We prospectively collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, and pharmacological data on 423 consecutive ESRD patients on hemodialysis awaiting renal transplantation. Survival analysis was performed as a function of statin therapy. The baseline characteristics were as follows: age 57\u2009\u00b1\u200911 years, males 64%, diabetes mellitus in 68%, known coronary artery disease in 30%, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction 61\u2009\u00b1\u200911%. Over a mean follow-up of 2 years, there were 43 deaths. Adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, smoking, and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, \u03b2 blocker, and antiplatelet medications, statin use was a predictor of lower mortality (hazard ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.11-0.79, p\u2009=\u20090.01). This beneficial effect of statin was supported by propensity score analysis (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and was consistent across all clinical subgroups.

After treatment for eight weeks, telmisartan could significantly enhance the therapeutic\u00a0efficacy of\u00a0pitavastatin by extremely reducing body weight gain, weight of adipose tissue and adipocyte size. However, telmisartan/pitavastatin combinations could not further improve lipid levels on the basis of pitavastain, though single telmisartan markedly decreased triglyceride (TG) and slightly increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Moreover, telmisartan/pitavastatin combinations significantly upregulated the gene expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b4, but no effects on the expression of PPAR-\u03b1/\u03b3, leptin and adiponectin compared to monotherapy.

However, the causal relationship must be clarified and confirmed in animal experiments. Therefore, we mimicked hypercholesterolemia by feeding rabbits a high-cholesterol diet (HCD) and performed 16 weeks of atorvastatin administration to investigate the effect of statin on glucose metabolism. The intravenous glucose tolerance test showed that plasma glucose levels in the statin-treated rabbits were consistently higher and that there was a slower rate of glucose clearance from the blood than in HCD rabbits. The incremental area under the curve for glucose in the statin-treated rabbits was also significantly larger than in the HCD rabbits. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the intravenous insulin tolerance test. The glucose-lowering ability of exogenous insulin was not impaired by statin treatment in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. The administration of a single dose of statin did not affect glucose metabolism in normal rabbits. The statin also significantly increased the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate transaminase and decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the hypercholesterolemic rabbits, whereas it did not affect plasma levels of glucose and insulin. The current results showed that atorvastatin treatment resulted in a significant delay of glucose clearance in hypercholesterolemic rabbits, and this rabbit model could be suitable for studying the effects of statin on glucose metabolism.",

    "58": "Panitumumab has proven efficacy in patients with metastatic or locally advanced colorectal cancer patients, provided that they have no activating KRAS mutation in their tumour. Simvastatin blocks the mevalonate pathway and thereby interferes with the post-translational modification of KRAS. We hypothesize that the activity of the RAS-induced pathway in patients with a KRAS mutation might be inhibited by simvastatin. This would theoretically result in increased sensitivity to panitumumab, potentially comparable with tumours with wild-type KRAS. A Simon two-stage design single-arm, phase II study was designed to test the safety and efficacy of the addition of simvastatin to panitumumab in colorectal cancer patients with a KRAS mutation after failing fluoropyrimidine-based, oxaliplatin-based and irinotecan-based therapy. The primary endpoint of this study was the proportion of patients alive and free from progression 11 weeks after the first administration of panitumumab, aiming for at least 40%, which is comparable with, although slightly lower than, that in KRAS wild-type patients in this setting. If this 40% was reached, then the study would continue into the second step up to 46 patients. Explorative correlative analysis for mutations in the KRAS and related pathways was carried out. One of 14 patients was free from progression at the primary endpoint time. The median progression-free survival was 8.4 weeks and the median overall survival status was 19.6 weeks. We conclude that the concept of mutant KRAS phenotype expression modulation with simvastatin was not applicable in the clinic.", 
    "59": "We develop a Bayesian multinomial network meta-analysis model for unordered (nominal) categorical outcomes that allows for partially observed data in which exact event counts may not be known for each category. This model properly accounts for correlations of counts in mutually exclusive categories and enables proper comparison and ranking of treatment effects across multiple treatments and multiple outcome categories. We apply the model to analyze 17 trials, each of which compares two of three treatments (high and low dose statins and standard care/control) for three outcomes for which data are complete: cardiovascular death, non-cardiovascular death and no death. We also analyze the cardiovascular death category divided into the three subcategories (coronary heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases) that are not completely observed. The multinomial and network representations show that high dose statins are effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "60": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. It is associated with an important mortality rate and the incidence is increasing. Patients showing metabolic syndrome seem to have higher incidence and mortality rates from hepatocellular carcinoma than healthy subjects, especially those with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Thus, metformin and statins, both to treat features of metabolic syndrome, have been proposed to decrease the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Otherwise, liver cancer is the result of a complex process which impairs several signaling cascades, such as RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Metformin (through 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase pathway activation) and statins (through 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibition) show anti-tumoral properties modifying several steps of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling cascades. On the other hand, metformin and statins have been found to reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma up to 50% and 60%, respectively. Furthermore, both drugs have shown a dose-dependent protective effect. However, information about chemopreventive role of metformin and statins is mainly obtained of observational studies, which could not take into account some bias. In conclusion, given the rising of incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and the important morbidity and mortality rates associated with this cancer, looking for chemopreventive strategies is an essential task. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the definite role of metformin and statins on the prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma.", 
    "61": "The practice of outpatient general internal medicine requires a diverse and evolving knowledge base. General internists must identify practice-changing shifts in the literature and reflect on their impact. Accordingly, we conducted a review of practice-changing articles published in outpatient general internal medicine in 2014. To identify high-quality, clinically relevant publications, we reviewed all titles and abstracts published in the following primary data sources in 2014: New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), Annals of Internal Medicine, JAMA Internal Medicine, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. All 2014 primary data summaries from Journal Watch-General Internal Medicine and ACP JournalWise also were reviewed. The authors used a modified Delphi method to reach consensus on inclusion of 8 articles using the following criteria: clinical relevance to outpatient internal medicine, potential for practice change, and strength of evidence. Clusters of important articles around one clinical question were considered as a single-candidate series. The article merits were debated until consensus was reached on the final 8, spanning a variety of topics commonly encountered in outpatient general internal medicine.",

In hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) selectively impairs survival and neurite growth of newborn neurons in the 2(nd) week after birth. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of SV on the impairment of neurogenesis and the spatial cognitive deficits in A\u03b225-35 (3\u00a0nmol)-injected (i.c.v.) mice (A\u03b225-35-mice). Herein, we reported that the SV-treatment (20\u00a0mg/kg) on days 2-14 after BrdU-injection could dose-dependently protect the survival and neurite growth of newborn neurons, which was blocked by the \u03b17nAChR antagonist MLA or the farnesol (FOH) that can convert to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), but not the \u03b14\u03b22nAChR antagonist DH\u03b2E. The SV-treatment in A\u03b225-35-mice rescued the decline of Akt phosphorylation and increased the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in hippocampus, which was sensitive to MLA and FOH. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 could abolish the SV-protected neurogenesis in A\u03b225-35-mice, but the MEK inhibitor U0126 had no effects. The SV-treatment could correct the decline of hippocampal BDNF concentration in A\u03b225-35-mice, which was blocked by MLA and FOH. Using Morris water maze and Y-maze tasks, we further observed that the SV-treatment in A\u03b225-35-mice could improve their spatial cognitive deficits, which was sensitive to the application of FOH. The results indicate that the SV-treatment in A\u03b225-35-mice via reduction of FPP can protect neurogenesis through \u03b17nAChR-cascading PI3K-Akt and increasing BDNF, which may improve spatial cognitive function.", 
    "64": "Atorvastatin (ATO), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, is used widely for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Application of this drug has now been made somehow limited because of ATO associated several acute and chronic side effects. The present study has been carried out to investigate the dose-dependent hepatic tissue toxicity in ATO induced oxidative impairment and cell death in mice. Administration of ATO enhanced ALT, ALP level, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and altered the pro oxidant-antioxidant status of liver by reducing intracellular GSH level, anti-oxidant enzymes activities and increasing intracellular lipid peroxidation. Our experimental evidence suggests that ATO markedly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, disturbed the Bcl-2 family protein balance, enhanced cytochrome c release in the cytosol, increased the levels of Apaf1, caspase-9, -3, cleaved PARP protein and ultimately led to apoptotic cell death. Besides, ATO distinctly increased the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK MAPKs, enhanced Caspase12 and calpain level. Histological studies also support the dose-dependent toxic effect of ATO in these organs pathophysiology. These results reveal that ATO induces hepatic tissue toxicity via MAPKs, mitochondria and ER dependent signaling pathway, in which calcium ions and ROS act as the pivotal mediators of the apoptotic signaling.",

Fifty seven male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: I - rats with diabetes mellitus and glycemic variability treated with Simvastatin (20 mg/kg body weight, intragastral during 8 weeks); II - placebo-treated rats with DM and glycemic variability; III - placebo treated rats with DM and IV - nondiabetic control rats. DM was induced by feeding rats with high-fat diet (61%) during five weeks and low-dose of Streptozotocin (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Daily glucose excursions were stimulated by feeding animals twice a day. We measured fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin and HOMAIR was calculated. Higher insulin resistance in diabetic rats is related to greater daily glycemic variability. In our study was installed significant increasing HOMAIR in diabetics rats with glycemic excursions comparison with the control. Our results showed that the simvastatin-treatment decreases the indices glycemic variability and HOMA in diabetic rats with glycemic excursions.",

Therefore, alleviation of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) by a reliable drug remains a matter of interest in experimental research. The aim of this study was to explore the structural alterations in the myocardium induced by atorvastatin (ATOR) in DCM, induced by streptozotocin (STZ), along with the associated changes occurring in apoptosis and oxidative stress markers. Thirty-two rats were divided into four groups; group A (control), group B (non-diabetic, received ATOR, orally, 50 mg/kg daily), group C (DCM, received STZ 70 mg/kg, single i.p. injection) and group D (DCM + ATOR). After 6 weeks, left ventricle (LV) specimens were prepared for histological and immunohistochemical study by hematoxlyin and eosin, Masson`s trichrome, anti-cleaved caspase-3 stains as well as for assays of oxidative stress markers. All data were measured morphometrically and statistically analyzed. The DCM group showed disorganization of the cardiomyocytes, interstitial edema, numerous fibroblasts, significant increases in the collagen volume fraction (p < 0.001), cleaved caspase-3 expression % area (p < 0.001) and, malondialdehyde in blood (p < 0.001), in LV (p < 0.05) compared with DCM + ATOR group. The latter has LV wall thickness, relative heart weight and antioxidant activities nearly similar to the control, independent from ATOR lipid-lowering effect. Therefore, ATOR can preserve myocardial structure in DCM nearly similar to normal. This may be achieved by suppressing apoptosis that parallels the correction of the antioxidant markers, which can be considered as non-lipid lowering benefit of statins.",

It is unknown whether they have the same effect against migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induced by Hcy. In this study, it was investigated whether and how atorvastatin could inhibit the Hcy-induced migration in cultured VSMCs and revealed the possible redox mechanism. VSMCs were isolated from the thoracic aortas of Sprague-Dawley rats. The migration of VSMCs was examined using a transwell technique and cell viability was determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using the fluoroprobe 2'7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. The activity of NADPH oxidase was assessed by lucigenin enhanced chemiluminescence. Expressions of Nox1 mRNA and p-p38MAPK protein were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. The results showed that atorvastatin inhibited the migration of VSMCs induced by Hcy, which was reversed by the mevalonate. In addition, pretreatment with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI, the free radical scavenger NAC and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 blocked Hcy-induced VSMCs migration. Furthermore, atorvastatin suppressed Hcy-induced activation of NADPH oxidase and ROS, attenuated Hcy-induced overexpression of Nox1mRNA. Similar effects occurred with VSMCs transfected with Nox1 siRNA. Moreover, atorvastatin other than DPI, NAC, SB203580 and Nox1 siRNA transfection blocked Hcy-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which was also reversed by the mevalonate. The data demonstrates that atorvastatin inhibits Hcy-induced VSMCs migration in a mevalonate pathway. Furthermore, a part of the biological effect of atorvastatin involves a decrease in the levels of Nox1-dependent ROS generation and p38 MAPK activation.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether inhibition of HMGCR by atovastatin would significantly affect Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) infection and immunological reaction in BALB/c mice. The results showed atovastatin significantly stimulated PCV2 replication in vivo. Immunological reaction in atovastatin-treated mice was also significantly enhanced during PCV2 infection.

    "120": "The mevalonate pathway is responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol, coenzyme Q, and prenyl groups essential for small GTPase modification and function, and for the production of dolichols important for protein glycosylation. Statins, i.e., cholesterol-lowering drugs that inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, HMG-CoA reductase, are lethal to Caenorhabditis elegans even though this animal lacks the branch of the mevalonate pathway that leads to cholesterol synthesis. To better understand the effects of statins that are not related to cholesterol, we have adopted the strategy of isolating statin-resistant C. elegans mutants. Previously, we showed that such mutants often have gain-of-function mutations in ATFS-1, a protein that activates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Here, we describe the isolation of a statin-resistant mutant allele of the NDUF-7 protein, which is a component of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The novel nduf-7(et19) mutant also exhibits constitutive and ATFS-1-dependent activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR(mt)) and prolonged life span, both of which are mediated through production of ROS. Additionally, lifespan extension, but not activation, of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response was dependent on the pro-apoptotic gene ced-4. We conclude that the nduf-7(et19) mutant allele causes an increase in reactive oxygen species that activate ATFS-1, hence UPR(mt)-mediated statin resistance, and extends life span via CED-4.",

Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant study had institutional review board approval, and written informed consent was obtained. Two hundred two subjects were recruited to an ongoing prospective study designed to evaluate the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on atherosclerosis. Eligible subjects were asymptomatic individuals older than 55 years who were eligible for statin therapy. Coronary CT angiography was performed by using a 320-detector row scanner. Coronary wall thickness and plaque were evaluated in all epicardial coronary arteries greater than 2 mm in diameter. Images were analyzed by using dedicated software involving an adaptive lumen attenuation algorithm. Total plaque index (calcified plus noncalcified plaque) was defined as plaque volume divided by vessel length. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between risk factors and plaque indexes. Results The mean age of the subjects was 65.5 years \u00b1 6.9 (standard deviation) (36% women), and the median coronary artery calcium (CAC) score was 73 (interquartile range, 1-434). The total coronary plaque index was higher in men than in women (42.06 mm(2) \u00b1 9.22 vs 34.33 mm(2) \u00b1 8.35; P < .001). In multivariable analysis controlling for all risk factors, total plaque index remained higher in men than in women (by 5.01 mm(2); P = .03) and in those with higher simvastatin doses (by 0.44 mm(2)/10 mg simvastatin dose equivalent; P = .02).

The use of immunomodulatory agents such as statins to target host inflammatory responses in influenza virus infection has been suggested as an adjunct treatment, especially during pandemics, when antiviral quantities are limited or vaccine production can be delayed. Methods. \u2003We used population-based, influenza hospitalization surveillance data, propensity score-matched analysis, and Cox regression to determine whether there was an association between mortality (within 30 days of a positive influenza test) and statin treatment among hospitalized cohorts from 2 influenza seasons (October 1, 2007 to April 30, 2008 and September 1, 2009 to April 31, 2010).

In this study, we assayed plasma concentrations of three typical anionic UTs, indoxyl sulfate (IS), 3-indoleacetic acid (IA), and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid (CMPF), in 20 hemodialysis patients and 5 healthy volunteers. Moreover, the effects of these anionic UTs on the binding of pravastatin to human serum albumin (HSA) were also evaluated. CMPF concentrations in the plasma of patients were unchanged before and after dialysis (63.0 \u00b1 6.3 \u03bcM and 65.1 \u00b1 6.7 \u03bcM, respectively), and these values were about 5-fold greater compared with those in healthy volunteers. Although dialysis decreased the plasma IS concentration from 157.9 \u00b1 19.9 \u03bcM to 103.8 \u00b1 13.3 \u03bcM, the value after hemodialysis was still ca. 27-fold greater than that in healthy volunteers. IA concentrations before and after hemodialysis were almost identical to those in healthy volunteers. There were no significant differences in the plasma concentrations of the three anionic UTs between male and female patients. The magnitude of protein binding was in the order CMPF>IS>IA, indicating that hemodialysis clearance of these anionic UTs was dependent on their protein binding capacities. The ability of IS to reduce pravastatin binding to HSA was much greater than that of CMPF. The present results suggest that statins bind to site II on HSA, and that their binding is modulated by IS when elevated in hemodialysis patients.", 
    "170": "Individual taste sensitivity affects one's eating habits, and could thus play a role in the development of lifestyle-related diseases, such as obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia. However, only a handful of studies have been conducted to investigate these associations. Therefore, we performed taste sensitivity tests on approximately 250 patients with lifestyle-related diseases who were undergoing outpatient treatment at the Department of Internal Medicine, or received a health check-up in order to examine the associations of individual taste sensitivity with their eating habits and lifestyle-related diseases. Our findings showed that sensitivity to sweet or salt taste was significantly lower in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and sensitivity to umami taste was significantly lower in obese patients. These findings suggest that taste sensitivity disorders may be linked not only to eating habits and lifestyle-related diseases, but also to the onset of cardiovascular diseases. Many of the drugs used in the treatment of lifestyle-related diseases and cardiovascular diseases, including antihypertensive agents, statins, fibrates, and allopurinol, are known to form zinc chelates and thereby possibly cause drug-induced taste disorders.

Each of Atorvastatin and Ezetimibe can be determined independent of the other when scanned at \u0394\u03bb=100\u2009nm and 40\u2009nm, respectively. The relative fluorescence intensity-concentration plots at two wavelengths, 272 (\u0394\u03bb=100\u2009nm) and 266\u2009nm (\u0394\u03bb=40\u2009nm) were rectilinear over the range of 0.4-8\u2009\u00b5g/mL (for Atorvastatin) and 0.6-8\u2009\u00b5g/mL (for Ezetimibe), respectively. The second method is based on the technique of simultaneous equations (Vierodt's method), in which two equations are solved simultaneously after using a single excitation wavelength of 273\u2009nm and \u03bbEm1=380\u2009nm of Atorvastatin and \u03bbEm2=301\u2009nm of Ezetimibe. Under the optimum conditions, linear relationships were found between the relative fluorescence intensity and the concentrations of the investigated drugs in the range of 0.4-8\u2009\u00b5g/mL (for Atorvastatin) 0.6-8\u2009\u00b5g/mL (for Ezetimibe). The different experimental parameters affecting the fluorescence intensities of the two drugs were carefully studied and optimized. The proposed methods were successfully applied for the determination of the investigated drugs in pure form, dosage form and in synthetic mixtures with good recovery and the results obtained were favorably compared to those obtained with a reference method.",

The solubility of both drugs was determined in excipient screening studies. Ternary-phase diagrams were drawn for 27 systems composed of different surfactants, cosurfactants, and oils at different surfactant-to-cosurfactant (S/CoS) ratios, and the system exhibiting the largest percentage area of the self-microemulsifying region was selected. The optimum oil ratio in the SMEDDS was selected by evaluating the mean droplet size of the resultant microemulsions. The underlying mechanism of the lower ATR loading capacity compared with EZT was elucidated by measurement of the zeta potential and UV absorption analysis. The results implied that ATR was located exclusively in the surfactant-cosurfactant layer, whereas EZT was located both in the microemulsion core and the surfactant-cosurfactant layer. In vitro dissolution studies showed that the SMEDDS had higher initial dissolution rates for both drugs when compared with marketed products. More importantly, EZT had a significantly increased dissolution profile in distilled water and pH 4.0 acetate buffer, implying enhanced bioavailability.",

Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been identified as the key lipid parameter in both genders whereas HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides have been more closely associated, in some studies, with cardiovascular risk in women. Menopause has been shown to be associated with an increase in total and LDL-cholesterol and a decrease in HDL-cholesterol (predominantly in the HDL2 subfraction). Despite its beneficial effects on the lipid profile, hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women. The latest meta-analysis of statin trials with gender-specific outcomes showed a similar benefit in women and men. The addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin in patients with acute coronary syndromes showed a further reduction of the primary endpoint in both genders. While there are no gender-related differences in drug treatment of dyslipidemia, current guidelines, to avoid overtreatment, strongly suggest risk estimation before initiating lipid-lowering treatment in women without manifest cardiovascular disease.",

Despite the adoption of a wide variety of therapeutics, the mortality from community-acquired pneumonia has remained relatively constant. Although viral and fungal acute airway infections can result in pneumonia, bacteria are the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in nearly 50% of cases. Pneumolysin is a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin or pore-forming toxin produced by Streptococcus pneumonia and has been shown to play a critical role in bacterial pathogenesis. Airway epithelium is the initial site of many bacterial contacts and its barrier and mucosal immunity functions are central to infectious lung diseases. In our studies, we have shown that the prior exposure to statins confers significant resistance of airway epithelial cells to the cytotoxicity of pneumolysin. We decided to take this study one step further, assessing changes in both the transcriptome and lipidome of human airway epithelial cells exposed to toxin, statin or both. Our current work provides the first global view in human airway epithelial cells of both the transcriptome and the lipid interactions that result in cellular protection from pneumolysin.",

ESA hyporesponsiveness contributes to the morbidity, mortality and health-care economic burden of ESRD patients. The most common causes of ESA resistance are absolute or functional iron deficiency and inflammation. Maintaining adequate iron stores is clearly accepted as the most important strategy for reducing the ESA requirement and for enhancing ESA efficacy. Recent clinical studies have shown that iron administration to ESRD patients is associated with an increased risk of infection and atherosclerosis. ESA hyporesponsiveness due to chronic inflammation in ESRD patients has been reported to be improved by a number of interventions, including the use of biocompatible hemodialysis membranes, ultrapure dialysate, ascorbic acid therapy, vitamin E supplementation, and statin therapy. Other causes of ESA hyporesponsiveness include inadequate dialysis, hyperparathyroidism, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, primary bone marrow disorders, myelosuppressive agents, hemoglobinopathies, hemolysis, and hypersplenism.

Several studies have explored a possible protective effect of statins to reduce the morbidity and mortality of many infectious diseases. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the main pathogens implicated in nosocomial infections; its ability to form biofilms makes treatment difficult. The present study observed the MIC of atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin against S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis. Simvastatin was the only agent with activity against clinical isolates and reference strains of methicilin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Thus, the effects of simvastatin on the growth, viability and biofilm formation of S. aureus were tested. In addition, a possible synergistic effect between simvastatin and vancomycin was evaluated. Simvastatin's MIC was 15.65 \u00b5g/mL for S. aureus 29213 and 31.25 \u00b5g/mL for the other strains of S. aureus. The effect of simvastatin was bactericidal at 4xMIC and bacteriostatic at the MIC concentration. No synergistic effect was found between simvastatin and vancomycin. However, the results obtained against S. aureus biofilms showed that, in addition to inhibiting adhesion and biofilm formation at concentrations from 1/16xMIC to 4xMIC, simvastatin was also able to act against mature biofilms, reducing cell viability and extra-polysaccharide production. In conclusion, simvastatin showed pronounced antimicrobial activity against S. aureus biofilms, reducing their formation and viability.",

Adiponectin was also positively correlated with severity of DR in patients with nonproliferative DR (P < .0003), significant also after all covariate adjustments (P = .018). When the proliferative DR group was included, this relationship was attenuated by adjustments, possibly an influence of estimated glomerular filtration rate reduction in the proliferative DR group. HOMA-IR was not different in the DR and non-DR groups. Although elevated, adiponectin retained a typical inverse relationship with HOMA-IR in DR, similar to that seen in the non-DR group.",

    "217": "One serious side effect of statin drugs is skeletal muscle myopathy. Although the mechanism(s) responsible for statin myopathy remains to be fully determined, an increase in muscle atrophy gene expression and changes in mitochondrial content and/or function have been proposed to play a role. In this study, we examined the relationship between statin-induced expression of muscle atrophy genes, regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, and markers of mitochondrial content in slow- (ST) and fast-twitch (FT) rat skeletal muscles. Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with simvastatin (60 or 80 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) or vehicle control via oral gavage for 14 days. In the absence of overt muscle damage, simvastatin treatment induced an increase in atrogin-1, MuRF1 and myostatin mRNA expression; however, these were not associated with changes in peroxisome proliferator gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) protein or markers of mitochondrial content. Simvastatin did, however, increase neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS) and AMPK \u03b1-subunit protein expression, and tended to increase total NOS activity, in FT but not ST muscles. Furthermore, simvastatin induced a decrease in \u03b2-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (\u03b2-HAD) activity only in FT muscles. These findings suggest that the statin-induced activation of muscle atrophy genes occurs independent of changes in PGC-1\u03b1 protein and mitochondrial content. Moreover, muscle-specific increases in NOS expression and possibly NO production, and decreases in fatty acid oxidation, could contribute to the previously reported development of overt statin-induced muscle damage in FT muscles.", 
    "218": "The interleukin (IL)-6 inhibits the growth of early-stage melanoma cells, but not metastatic cells. Metastatic melanoma cells are susceptible to statin-induced apoptosis, but this is not clear for early-stage melanoma cells. This study aimed to investigate the IL-6 susceptibility of melanoma cells from different stages in the presence of simvastatin to overcome loss of growth arrest. ELISA was used to detect secreted IL-6 in human melanoma cells. The effects of IL-6 were measured by western blots for STAT3 and Bcl-2 family proteins. Apoptosis and proliferation were measured by caspase 3 activity, Annexin V staining, cell cycle analysis, and a wound-healing assay. Human metastatic melanoma cells A375 and 518A2 secrete high amounts of IL-6, in contrast to early-stage WM35 cells. Canonical IL-6 signaling is intact in these cells, documented by transient phosphorylation of STAT3. Although WM35 cells are highly resistant to simvastatin-induced apoptosis, coadministration with IL-6 enhanced the susceptibility to undergo apoptosis. This proapoptotic effect of IL-6 might be explained by a downregulation of Bcl-XL, observed only in WM35 cells. Furthermore, the IL-6 receptor blocking antibody tocilizumab was coadministered and unmasked an IL-6-sensitive proportion in the simvastatin-induced caspase 3 activity of metastatic melanoma cells. These results confirm that simvastatin facilitates apoptosis in combination with IL-6. Although endogenous IL-6 secretion is sufficient in metastatic melanoma cells, exogenously added IL-6 is needed for WM35 cells. This effect may explain the failure of simvastatin to reduce melanoma incidence in clinical trials and meta-analyses.", 
    "219": "Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1, encoded by SLCO1B1 gene) is a hepatic uptake transporter, and its genetic variability is associated with pharmacokinetics and muscle toxicity risk of simvastatin. We examined the possible effects of variations in the SLCO1B1 gene on the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin in a prospective genotype panel study.", 
    "220": "Seven healthy volunteers with the SLCO1B1*1B/*1B genotype, five with the SLCO1B1*5/*15 or *15/*15 genotype, and 15 with the SLCO1B1*1A/*1A genotype (controls) were recruited. Each study participant ingested a single 40-mg dose of lovastatin. Plasma concentrations of lovastatin (inactive lactone) and its active metabolite lovastatin acid were measured up to 24\u2009h.", 
    "221": "In the SLCO1B1*5/*15 or *15/*15 genotype group, the geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-24 of lovastatin acid were 340 and 286% of the corresponding values in the SLCO1B1*1A/*1A (reference) genotype group (P<0.005). In contrast, the AUC0-24 of lovastatin acid in the SLCO1B1*1B/*1B genotype group was only 68% of that in the reference genotype group (P=0.03). No statistically significant association was observed between the SLCO1B1 genotype and the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin lactone.", 
    "222": "SLCO1B1*5/*15 and *15/*15 genotypes markedly increase the exposure to active lovastatin acid, but have no significant effect on lovastatin lactone, similar to their effects on simvastatin and simvastatin acid. Accordingly, it is probable that the risk of muscle toxicity during lovastatin treatment is increased in individuals carrying the SLCO1B1*5 or *15 allele. The SLCO1B1*1B/*1B genotype is associated with reduced lovastatin acid concentrations, consistent with enhanced hepatic uptake."
