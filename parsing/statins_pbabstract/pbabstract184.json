The objective of this study was to perform solid state characterization of commercial crystalline and amorphous ATC drug samples available in the Indian market. Six samples each of crystalline and amorphous ATC were characterized using X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis, Karl Fisher titrimetry, microscopy (hot stage microscopy, scanning electron microscopy), contact angle, and intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR). All crystalline ATC samples were found to be stable form I, however one sample possessed polymorphic impurity, evidenced in XRPD and DSC analysis. Amongst the amorphous ATC samples, XRPD demonstrated five samples to be amorphous 'form 27', while, one matched amorphous 'form 23'. Thermal behavior of amorphous ATC samples was compared to amorphous ATC generated by melt quenching in DSC. ATC was found to be an excellent glass former with T(g)/T(m) of 0.95. Residual crystallinity was detected in two of the amorphous samples by complementary use of conventional and modulated DSC techniques. The wettability and IDR of all amorphous samples was found to be higher than the crystalline samples. In conclusion, commercial ATC samples exhibited diverse solid state behavior that can impact the performance and stability of the dosage forms.", 
    "1": "Inflammation, vascular proliferation. and apoptosis contribute to the process of atherosclerosis. Clopidogrel has been used to treat atherosclerosis; however, the mechanism is not entirely known. Compared with those of atorvastatin, we determined effects of clopidogrel on inflammatory factors, vascular proliferation, and apoptosis in an atherosclerosis rabbit model. New Zealand white rabbits were fed a normal diet or a high cholesterol diet for 7 weeks. The right iliac artery of animals except those in the negative control group were balloon-injured 1 week after initiation of the diet, and groups of animals were treated with clopidogrel (4 mg/kg per day), atorvastatin (2.5 mg/kg per day), or placebo (positive control group) for 6 weeks. We found that the placebo group had significant progression of atherosclerosis compared with the negative control group. In contrast, clopidogrel- or atorvastatin-treated rabbits showed a significant reduction in progression of atherosclerosis, including a low expression of high sensitivity C-reactive protein and platelet-derived growth factor, a reduced intima thickness, and reduced ratio of bcl-2/bax in the vascular wall. These results suggest that clopidogrel can retard the progression of established lesions that is related to inhibiting inflammation, cell proliferation, and promotion of cell apoptosis.",

Here, we show that expression of HuR in human umbilical vein endothelial cells is regulated by shear stress and statin treatment; HuR, in turn, regulates other stress-sensitive genes such as Kruppel-like factor 2 (Klf2), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP-4). We found that siRNA knockdown of HuR-inhibited inflammatory responses in endothelial cells, including ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 up-regulation, NFkappaB phosphorylation, and adhesion of monocytes. Tissue staining of the mouse aorta revealed increased HuR expression in the lesser curvature region of the arch that is exposed to disturbed flow, consistent with our in vitro data.

This study investigated the effect of the imidazoline I(1)-receptor/alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist moxonidine, as compared to the lipid lowering drug simvastatin, on abnormalities induced by cigarette smoke (CS) in renovascular reactivity. Six rat groups were used: control, CS (twice a day for 6weeks), simvastatin, moxonidine, CS+simvastatin, and CS+moxonidine. CS exposure increased plasma urea and creatinine and reduced plasma and renal nitrate/nitrite (NOx). In isolated perfused phenylephrine-preconstricted kidneys of CS rats, vasodilator responses to carbachol or isoprenaline, but not papaverine, were attenuated. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) reduced carbachol vasodilations in control but not CS kidneys, suggesting the impairment of NOS activity by CS. Simultaneous administration of moxonidine or simvastatin abolished CS-induced abnormalities in indices of renal function, NOx, and vasodilations caused by carbachol or isoprenaline. The possibility whether alterations in antioxidant or lipid profiles contributed to the interaction was investigated. CS increased renal malondialdyde and decreased glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Further, CS reduced plasma HDL and increased cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL. Simvastatin or moxonidine abolished the deleterious CS effects on antioxidant activity; the lipid profile was normalized by simvastatin only. These findings highlight that renovascular dysfunction caused by CS and the underlying oxidative damage is evenly attenuated by moxonidine and simvastatin.",

Statin therapy may have beneficial effects on the clinical outcome in patients with heart failure (HF). HF is associated with lipoprotein components. A recent study suggested that lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were the strongest predictor of worsening HF. In addition, serum total cholesterol (TC) is a prognostic factor for patients with HF. Although the levels of HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I, triglyceride, TC, and LDL cholesterol may be associated with the onset of HF and/or an adverse prognosis in patients with HF, it is not yet clear which lipoprotein plays the most important role in this context. Among these lipoproteins, HDL protects against cardiovascular events by mediating the enhancement of reverse cholesterol transport. Moreover, HDL also has pleiotropic effects, such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic properties. An increase in HDL cholesterol or ApoA-I, the principal Apo of HDL, may be a therapeutic target in HF. Therefore, we discuss here the usefulness of statins and lipoprotein metabolism for preventing HF.",

After the experiments, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and levels of glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were determined, and histopathological changes were examined in all rat ovarian tissue. Ischemia and I/R increased the LPO level and MPO activity while decreasing the SOD activity and GSH level significantly in comparison to the sham group. The 5- and 10-mg/kg doses of atorvastatin before ischemia and I/R reversed the trend in LPO level and MPO activity. The levels of SOD and GSH were decreased by ischemia and I/R. The administration of atorvastatin before ischemia and I/R treatments also reversed the trend in the SOD and GSH levels. In the I/R plus atorvastatin groups, although minimal vascular dilation in the ovary stoma and some degenerative cell clusters were seen, most of the cellular structures showed no pathological changes. Administration of atorvastatin is effective in reversing tissue damage induced by ischemia and/or I/R in ovaries.",

MLC-6 cells expressed BMP type-I and -II receptors and Smads as well as osteoclast markers including TRAP, RANK, cathepsin-K, M-CSF receptor, MMP-9 and calcitonin receptor. Treatment with RANKL and BMP-2 acted synergistically to stimulate RANK, TRAP and cathepsin-K expression in MLC-6 cells. Simvastatin suppressed osteoclastic activity shown by increases in RANK, TRAP and cathepsin-K expression induced by RANKL and BMP-2. In contrast simvastatin alone had no effects on the osteoclastic markers in MLC-6 cells. Simvastatin activated ERK, SAPK/JNK and AKT pathways and inactivated Ras in MLC-6 cells. Simvastatin had no effect on BMP-induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation regardless of RANKL stimulation. Since chemical inhibition of ERK, SAPK/JNK and AKT increased TRAP and cathepsin-K expression induced by BMP-2 and RANKL, these pathways are functionally involved in inhibition of osteoclastic activity. In addition, Src phosphorylation induced by RANKL, which is involved in osteoclast differentiation, was suppressed by simvastatin. We further confirmed an inhibitory mechanism of simvastatin on osteoclast differentiation using human osteoclast precursor cells which express BMP receptor and Smad signaling machinery. Simvastatin also activated ERK pathways and inactivated Src phosphorylation in human osteoclasts differentiated by M-CSF and RANKL treatments. The inhibition of TRAP and RANK expression by simvastatin was reversed by ERK inhibition, whereas Src inhibitor enhanced simvastatin-induced suppression of osteoclast markers. Collectively, our data show that simvastatin inhibits osteoclastic differentiation through inhibiting Src as well as enhancing MAPK/AKT pathways.",

We questioned whether racial disparity existed in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. We examined the Veterans' Integrated Service Network (VISN 16) database with regard to the prescription rates for 4 cardiovascular agents-aspirin, beta blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The database, encompassing 474,565 patients (117,071 blacks and 357,494 whites), was analyzed. Cardioprotective drugs were prescribed significantly less often to black patients than compared to white patients (beta blockers 19.7% vs 24.8%, odds ratio [OR] 0.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.75; statins 20.5% vs 30.2%, OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.55; and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 27.7% vs 30.0%, OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.96; all p <0.0001, after adjustment for all covariates used in the analysis). Nonetheless, the prescription rates for aspirin were greater among the black patients than among the white patients (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.35, p <0.001) after adjustment. The black patients received coronary artery bypass grafting less often than did the white patients (0.4% vs 1.21%, OR 0.40% to 0.48%, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.42, p <0.001).

The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of moderate (40 mg) to high (80 mg) simvastatin doses on asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine levels in patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia (after target LDL-C levels, \u22642.6 mmol/L, are reached). The study included 120 adult patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol \u22657.5 mmol/L and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol \u22654.9 mmol/L). Asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, total homocysteine-by a high-performance liquid chromatographic method. There was a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein-B levels as well as in the apolipoprotein-B/apolipoprotein-A1 index after a 1-month therapy with 40 mg simvastatin (P <0.001). Asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine levels were also decreased but the difference did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.571; P= 0.569).

Asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine levels were lowered significantly with 80 mg simvastatin (P <0.001; P= 0.038). In conclusion, optimizing the target values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a moderate dose (40 mg) of simvastatin has no effect on asymmetric dimethylarginine and total homocysteine in contrast to a high dose (80 mg) after target LDL-C levels are reached (\u22642.6 mmol/L) in patients with newly detected severe hypercholesterolemia.",

These appear to occur mainly in patients with combined fibrate/statin therapy and possibly in those with low baseline HDL-C. Reports on HDL-C reductions after fenofibrate are possibly supported by the disappointing results in terms of HDL-C responses from the recent FIELD study. A survey on 581 patients treated for 1 year or longer was carried out in our Clinical Center. This indicated that paradoxical HDL-C reductions are a relatively uncommon phenomenon. Not more than 15.3% of the present series showed an HDL-C reduction, mostly of a modest degree. Further, reductions of HDL-C appear to occur mainly in individuals with significant HDL-C elevations (>50 mg/dL), almost never in patients with low HDL-C. Otherwise, there seems to be no impact of a previous diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension on the HDL-C changes. From a very recent pharmacogenomic study on the apo A1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster, genetic influences appear only to reduce the positive impact of fenofibrate on HDL-C, but do not indicate any risk of occurrence of HDL-C reductions. Also based on our very long experience with this drug, it appears that fenofibrate raises HDL-C levels in the vast majority of treated patients, with a particularly dramatic effect in individuals with low HDL-C and hypertriglyceridemia.",

Even for individuals surviving beyond the initial presentation and intervention for aneurysmal SAH, the occurrence of cerebral vasospasm has the potential to induce a second tier of complications that can be just as devastating as the inciting event. However, despite numerous studies and some initial advancements in management, therapeutic modalities are limited to help prevent or treat this complex entity. Historically, the mainstay of treatment for cerebral vasospasm has been a combination of hypervolemia, hemodilution, and hypertension. In addition, other systemic therapies such as oral nimodipine, statins, and intravenous magnesium, as well as intensive glucose control, appear to have some promise, although they are limited at times by adverse effects. To avoid these adverse consequences and perhaps gain some modicum of efficacy, attempts have been made to use endovascular techniques to physically dilate vessels or to administer drugs directly to the site of action and thus avoid many of the untoward effects of systemic pharmacotherapy. Controversy still remains over the success of intraarterial therapy, the drugs or techniques to be used, and the best timing of this therapy. Based on the currently available literature, it is impossible to assess the most effective intraarterial therapy. Randomized controlled trials that can control for baseline factors and technical expertise are needed to provide more conclusive data. Clinical pharmacists should be actively involved in assisting interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons in providing safe and appropriate pharmacotherapy in this promising but controversial arena of intraarterial drug delivery.",

The T/R ratio for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) was within 80-125% for atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, ramipril, ramiprilat and dose-normalized salicylic acid. However, for simvastatin, the T/R point estimates for C(max), AUC(t) and AUC(infinity) for Ln-transformed data were significantly lower ( approximately 3-4%) than the lower bound of 80%. For its active metabolite, simvastatin acid, these estimates were significantly higher ( approximately 25-35%) than the higher bound of 125%. Thus, the increased bioavailability of active simvastatin acid appeared to compensate for the loss of bioavailability of simvastatin.",

Overexpression of Nox4 increased basal level of ROS generation, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF expression in RCECs. In contrast, blockade of Nox4 activity using adenovirus-expressing dominant-negative Nox4 abolished hypoxia- and high-glucose-induced ROS production and VEGF expression. Moreover, inhibition of Nox4 attenuated hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF-1alpha and high-glucose-elicited phosphorylation of STAT3.

The effects of terutroban were compared with those of aspirin, another antiplatelet agent, and rosuvastatin, known to exert end-organ protection in SHRSP. Salt-loaded male SHRSP were treated orally once a day with vehicle, terutroban (30 mg/kg/day), aspirin (60 mg/kg/day), or rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day). Compared with vehicle, and regardless of any effect on blood pressure or serum thromboxane B(2) levels, terutroban significantly increased survival (p < 0.001) as a consequence of a delayed brain lesion occurrence monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (p < 0.001), and a delayed increase of proteinuria (p < 0.001). Terutroban decreased cerebral mRNA transcription of interleukin-1beta, transforming growth factor-beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 after 6 weeks of dietary treatment. Terutroban also prevented the accumulation of urinary acute-phase proteins at high molecular weight, identified as markers of systemic inflammation, and assessed longitudinally by one-dimensional electrophoresis. Terutroban also has protective effects on the vasculature as suggested by the preservation of endothelial function and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase expression in isolated carotid arteries. These effects are similar to those obtained with rosuvastatin, and superior to those of aspirin. Terutroban increases survival in SHRSP by reducing systemic inflammation as well as preserving endothelial function. These data support clinical development of terutroban in the prevention of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular complications of atherothrombosis.",

To achieve our goal, eight formulations (F(1)-F(8)) of SLNs were prepared by solvent injection technique and optimized by 2(3) full-factorial design. The design was validated by extra design checkpoint formulation (F(9)), and the possible interactions between independent variables were studied.

    "112": "Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO) is a paracrine factor that controls vascular tone, inhibits platelet function, prevents adhesion of leukocytes, and reduces proliferation of the intima. An enhanced inactivation and/or reduced synthesis of NO is seen in conjunction with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This condition, referred to as endothelial dysfunction, can promote vasospasm, thrombosis, vascular inflammation, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Vascular oxidative stress with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) contributes to mechanisms of vascular dysfunction. Oxidative stress is mainly caused by an imbalance between the activity of endogenous pro-oxidative enzymes (such as NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, or the mitochondrial respiratory chain) and anti-oxidative enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, heme oxygenase, thioredoxin peroxidase/peroxiredoxin, catalase, and paraoxonase) in favor of the former. Also, small molecular weight antioxidants may play a role in the defense against oxidative stress. Increased ROS concentrations reduce the amount of bioactive NO by chemical inactivation to form toxic peroxynitrite. Peroxynitrite-in turn-can \"uncouple\" endothelial NO synthase to become a dysfunctional superoxide-generating enzyme that contributes to vascular oxidative stress. Oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction can promote atherogenesis. Therapeutically, drugs in clinical use such as ACE inhibitors, AT(1) receptor blockers, and statins have pleiotropic actions that can improve endothelial function. Also, dietary polyphenolic antioxidants can reduce oxidative stress, whereas clinical trials with antioxidant vitamins C and E failed to show an improved cardiovascular outcome.",

Recently, we described that a metabolically stable anandamide analog, 2-methyl-2'-F-anandamide, by activation of CB1 receptors significantly inhibited cell proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines. In this study, we observed that the activation of the CB1 receptor, in two human mammary carcinoma cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF7, caused the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity due to a reduction of HMG-CoA reductase transcript levels. The decrease of HMG-CoA reductase activity induced the inhibition of the prenylation of proteins, in particular of the farnesylation of Ras oncogenic protein involved in cell proliferation of these cell lines. We suggest that the inhibitory effect of anandamide analog on tumor cell proliferation could be related to the inhibition of Ras farnesylation.", 
    "122": "The pathogenesis of hypertension and its mode of progression are complex, multifactoral and incompletely understood. However, there is accumulating evidence from humans and animal models of hypertension indicating that excessive central sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) plays a pathogenic role in triggering and sustaining the essential hypertensive state (the so-called 'neuroadrenergic hypothesis'). Importantly, augmented central sympathetic outflow has also been implicated in the initiation and progression of a plethora of pathophysiological processes independent of any increase in blood pressure, such as left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, the sympathetic nervous system constitutes an important putative drug target in hypertension. However, traditional pharmacological approaches for the management of essential hypertension appear ineffective in reducing central sympathetic outflow. Recently, several new and promising therapeutic strategies targeting neurogenic hypertension have been developed. The present report will provide a brief update of this topic with a particular emphasis on human studies examining the efficacy of novel pharmacological approaches (central sympatholytics and statins), lifestyle modification (aerobic exercise training, weight loss and stress reduction) and surgical intervention (renal denervation, chronic carotid baroreflex stimulation and deep brain stimulation) in reducing excessive central sympathetic activation in hypertension.", 
    "123": "Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been repeatedly described as a safe and efficacious procedure to provide a stroke-risk reduction benefit in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. Contemporary outcomes are acceptable using the large-scale randomized trials as a metric of success. Class I and II data can be applied to improve the care process of patients undergoing CEA. Myocardial infarction remains the most significant nonstroke complication; however, there is no significant benefit to noninvasive stress testing in patients with clinically stable disease. Perioperative beta-blockade may offer up to a 10-fold reduction in the rate of perioperative myocardial infarction, but deleterious effects are attributable to high-dose regimens. Angiotensin blockade has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in patients with atherosclerosis by up to 25%, although few studies have examined these agents directly in carotid surgery patients. Statins are beneficial to patients undergoing CEA with trials demonstrating up to a 3% absolute reduction in the incidence of stroke following CEA. Aspirin therapy is associated with an up to 7% absolute reduction in early stroke following CEA; however, the efficacy of combination or high-dose antiplatelet therapy remains ill-defined. A treatment strategy that involves perioperative medical optimization is likely to improve surgical outcomes and long-term cardiovascular risk for patients undergoing CEA.",

There were more patients with coronary artery disease, hypertension, and renal insufficiency in the DM group than non-DM, with the INS group having the highest incidence of renal insufficiency/dialysis (46%/20%). Gangrene and foot sepsis were significantly more frequent in patients in OM+INS (45%/3%) and INS (50%/6%) than non-DM (15%/0.2%) and D-OM groups (25%/1%; P < .001). More patients in the INS group (14%) and OM+INS (9%) had primary amputation than non-DM (4%) and D-OM (4%; P < .01). Mean follow-up was 26.3 +/- 20.7 months. Overall survival following revascularization was similar in D-OM and non-DM and OM+INS and INS, the latter being significantly worse (P < .001). The LS rate in D-OM and non-DM was also identical, whereas OM-INS and INS had significantly worse LS, with OM-INS marginally better than INS (P = .094). Primary patency (PP) was worse in endovascular-treated patients on insulin than non-DM and D-OM patients (P < .001), whereas PP was similar between groups in open-treated patients. Multivariate analysis showed that coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, indication for intervention, insulin use, nonambulatory status, and statin drug non-use were independently associated with decreased survival, whereas insulin use, presence of gangrene, need for infrapopliteal interventions, and nonambulatory status were independently associated with limb loss.

Managing dyslipidemia must be considered early in the HIV treatment process because certain antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, particularly those containing ritonavir, may exacerbate dyslipidemia risk. Statins are the most common medications used to treat dyslipidemia; however, because of drug-drug interactions, some are contraindicated with certain ART drugs. Other statins can be used but require dose adjustments when used with certain ART medications. Non-statin medications such as fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil) can be used to manage lipids and are discussed. Nurse clinicians should be prepared to discuss with the health care team potential alternative drug regimens for concurrent treatment of HIV infection and dyslipidemia.",

But, in spite of the overall decrease in LDL-cholesterol in the general population over the last 20 years and treatments with statins, the persistence of a high residual vascular risk is observed in some patients. This residual risk is observed mainly in patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia with low HDL-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides and a preponderance of small and dense LDL-cholesterol particles, a profile frequently found in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), obesity or metabolic syndrome and which has been called the \"lipid triad\". The frank increase in the prevalence of these metabolic abnormalities in populations worldwide casts doubt on the benefits acquired over the last few years in cardiovascular prevention. Not only does it appear essential to improve the treatment of all risk factors (hypertension, smoking, etc.), but it now seems necessary to manage all lipid parameters by decreasing LDL and also triglycerides and by increasing HDL. The development of new pathways of research and the introduction of novel compounds, which have demonstrated their clinical effectiveness, with regard to HDL in particular, are awaited.", 
    "142": "Pre\u03b2-1 high-density lipoprotein (HDL) is an acceptor of peripheral free cholesterol and thus a participant in reverse cholesterol transport. Because patients with diabetes may have defects in reverse cholesterol transport, we hypothesized that (1) pre\u03b2-1 HDL might be decreased in diabetes and (2) because niacin improves reverse cholesterol transport and may stimulate pre\u03b2-1 HDL maturation, niacin would further decrease steady-state levels of pre\u03b2-1 HDL in diabetes. Absolute levels of pre\u03b2-1 HDL mass were measured using an isotopic dilution-ultrafiltration assay that measures apolipoprotein (apo) A-I after physically isolating pre\u03b2-1. Plasma apo A-I concentration and routine lipids were also evaluated in 11 diabetic patients. Diabetic subjects have a nearly 50% reduction of circulating levels of pre\u03b2-1 HDL to 36 \u00b1 22 (1\u00a0SD) \u03bcg/mL compared with our previously published values of 73 \u00b1 44 \u03bcg/mL in 136 healthy subjects. After niacin therapy, there was a further 17% reduction of pre\u03b2-1 HDL levels to 30 \u00b1 26 \u03bcg/mL (P < .026) compared with baseline. The percentage of pre\u03b2-1 HDL in diabetic patients, as a percentage of total apo A-I, was about half of the normal value of 6.1% \u00b1 3.6%; after niacin in diabetic patients, the percentage further decreased from 3.3% \u00b1 2.1% to 2.3% \u00b1 1.9% (P < .003). Absolute levels of apo A-I were similar in diabetic patients (1.14 \u00b1 0.29) and healthy subjects (1.24 \u00b1 0.24), and were unchanged by niacin in diabetic patients. We conclude with the novel observations that diabetes is associated with significantly reduced levels of pre\u03b2-1 HDL and that, after niacin treatment, a further lowering of pre\u03b2-1 HDL levels occur. Several altered mechanisms of RCT in diabetes are consistent with low levels of pre\u03b2-1 HDL both before and after niacin treatment.",

However, this difference was not statistically significant after consideration of propensity scores (p=0.43). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated that the incidence of ESRD was significantly greater in the no-treatment group (HR=2.21, 95% CI 1.45-3.81, p=0.0007).

The tablets were prepared by direct compression method. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) K 30, Pluronic(R) F 127, and magnesium oxide were used to improve tablet properties. Magnesium stearate, talc, and lactose were used to aid the compression of tablets. The tablets were found to have good appearance, uniform thickness, diameter, weight, pH, and drug content. A 2(3) full factorial design was employed to study the effect of independent variables viz. levels of carrageenan gum, Pluronic F 127 and PVP K30, which significantly influenced characteristics like in vitro mucoadhesive strength, in vitro drug release, swelling index, and in vitro residence time. The tablet was coated with an impermeable backing layer of ethyl cellulose to ensure unidirectional drug release. Different penetration enhancers were tried to improve the permeation of pravastatin sodium through buccal mucosa. Formulation containing 1% sodium lauryl sulfate showed good permeation of pravastatin sodium through mucosa. Histopathological studies revealed no buccal mucosal damage.

Serum cortisol and serum lipid levels were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits and serum mevalonic acid (MVA) levels were measured using validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Rosuvastatin produced a statistically significant (P < 0.05) decrease in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. However, the increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease in cortisol and MVA were not statistically significant when compared to the placebo-treated group.

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of pitavastatin as an antioxidant to prevent intermittent hypoxia-induced left ventricular (LV) remodeling in mice without hypercholesterolemia. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (n=35) were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (30 s exposure to 5% oxygen, followed by 30 s exposure to 21% oxygen) for 8 h per day during the daytime or maintained under normoxic conditions; in addition, they were either treated with pitavastatin (3 mg kg(-1) per day) or vehicle for 10 days. After cardiac catheterization and blood sampling, the LV myocardium was examined. The systemic blood pressure and plasma level of total cholesterol were similar among the four groups. Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased the expression levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) proteins, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta mRNA, and also the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin end labeling (TUNEL)-positive myocardial cells in the LV myocardium. In addition, enhanced hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes, perivascular fibrosis and histological degeneration were observed in the mice exposed to hypoxic stress. Treatment with pitavastatin significantly suppressed the expression levels of the 4-HNE proteins, cytokines, superoxide production and TUNEL-positive myocardial cells in the LV myocardium, consequently attenuating the hypoxia-induced histological changes. Pitavastatin preserved, at least partially, the morphological structure of the LV myocardium in lean mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia, through its antioxidant effect.",

We demonstrated that needle-/plate-shaped lipid crystals in advanced plaques had undergone a phase shift to the solid state with increased protein contents, implying that lipid modification had occurred beforehand. The validity of lipid-selective multiplex CARS imaging was supported by comparative results from oil red O staining and whole-mount immunohistochemistry. By spatial CARS analysis of atherosclerosis progression, we found greater accumulation of lipid crystals in both the lesser curvature of the aortic arch and the innominate artery.

    "208": "Current lipid management guidelines are focused on decreasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) levels as the primary target for reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Yet, many recent studies suggest that low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) are a major independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. According to several clinical trials, a 1% increase in HDL-C is associated with a 0.7%-3% decrease in CHD events. The direct link between high levels of triglycerides (TG) and CHD, on the other hand, is less well defined. A large reduction in TG is needed to show a difference in CHD events, especially in men. Evidence for a shift in lipid management toward targeting both LDL-C and HDL-C as primary targets for therapy is presented. Currently, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) have proven to significantly decrease LDL-C levels, reduce CHD morbidity/mortality and improve overall survival. However, improvement of survival with statins may be due to other pleiotropic effects beyond LDL-C lowering. Fibric acid derivatives and niacin are primarily used to increase HDL-C levels, although with side effects. Future therapies targeting HDL-C may have profound results on reducing CHD morbidity and mortality. This article highlights existing and future targets in lipid management and is based on available clinical data. There is an urgent need for new treatments using a combination of drugs targeting both LDL-C and HDL-C.

EPCs were cultured from mononuclear cells of blood donors and isolated according to three protocols: CFU-EC (colony forming units-endothelial cells), early (or 'monocytic') EPCs and late outgrown EPCs. Rosuvastatin (0.1-100 nM) was added at the beginning of culture (T0) or after the initial adhesion step (T1). Polarization of monocytic EPCs was assessed as expression of proinflammatory M1 markers (CD68 and CCR2) or anti-inflammatory M2 markers (CX3CR1, CD163, CD206). We found that 1 nM rosuvastatin increased the number of CFU-EC and late EPCs by about 3-fold, while lower concentrations had no significant effects. Rosuvastatin (0.1 nM) increased AcLDL+Lectin+ early EPCs by about 60%, while higher concentrations exerted inhibitory effects on early EPCs. Addition of rosuvastatin at T0 was more effective in stimulating CFU-EC and early EPCs, while addition at T1 was more effective in stimulating late EPCs. Rosuvastatin had no effects on proliferation rate of CFU-EC, early EPCs and late EPCs. We also found that 0.1 nM rosuvastatin reduced the M1/M2 ratio in early EPCs, which retain monocytic features. In conclusion, we show that rosuvastatin had significant stimulatory effects on EPCs irrespective of the culture protocol. Rosuvastatin also induced anti-inflammatory polarization of monocytic EPCs.",

Renal anemia is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic heart failure and higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients et risk for CKD should be more often monitored for early detection of anemia so they could start with treatment on time. Recent studies show that erythropoeisis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are effective in predialysis especially if used with antihypertensive agents and statin. Correcting anemia in early stage kidney disease may delay progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESRD) and prolong time to start dialysis. Improved cardiac function in those patients reduce morbidity and mortality risk and improve quality of life (QoL) in patients with CKD."
