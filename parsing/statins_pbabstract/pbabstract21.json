Fourteen days after monocrotaline injection (60 mg/kg), male rats were treated orally for another 14 days with fasudil (15 mg/kg per day), or with a combination of fasudil + rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg per day).", 
    "2": "The drug combination reversed the MCT-induced increase in right ventricle pressure (RVP) and reduced right ventricular hypertrophy (RV/LV + S ratio) more than Rho kinase inhibitor alone. The simultaneous administration of fasudil and rosuvastatin caused a further decrease of RhoA kinase activity in isolated lung tissues as compared to fasudil alone.",

All patients received lipid-lowering medications (statin, niacin, and/or ezetimibe) and lifestyle modification. All patients underwent at least one follow-up CIMT measurement after starting their regimen. Annual biomarker, CIMT, and plaque measurements were analyzed for associations with CVD risk reduction treatment.",

Plaque composition changes occurred, including a decrease in lipid-rich plaques of 78.4% within the first 2 years (p < 0.001). After the first 2 years, CIMT and lipid-rich plaques continued to decline at reduced rates.",

The lipid effects of two different prescription omega-3 fatty acid therapies are described in a 55-year-old statin- and niacin-treated female with severe dyslipidemia and high CV risk. The patient was initially treated with omega-3-acid ethyl esters (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid) 4 g/day. Due to persistently elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), she was switched to icosapent ethyl (high-purity EPA ethyl ester) 4 g/day. Approximately 28 months after switching to icosapent ethyl, her LDL-C decreased by 69% to 52 mg/dL, triglycerides decreased by 35% to 119 mg/dL, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) decreased by 63% to 76 mg/dL, total cholesterol decreased by 44% to 137 mg/dL, and HDL-C increased by 45% to 61 mg/dL.

    "9": "Capsular fibrosis and contracture occurs in most breast reconstruction patients who undergo radiotherapy, and there is no definitive solution for its prevention. Simvastatin was effective at reducing fibrosis in various models. Peri-implant capsular formation is the result of tissue fibrosis development in irradiated breasts. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of simvastatin on peri-implant fibrosis in rats. Eighteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to an experimental group (9 rats, 18 implants) or a control group (9 rats, 18 implants). Two hemispherical silicone implants, 10 mm in diameter, were inserted in subpanniculus pockets in each rat. The next day, 10-Gy of radiation from a clinical accelerator was targeted at the implants. Simvastatin (15 mg/kg/day) was administered by oral gavage in the experimental group, while animals in the control group received water. At 12 weeks post-implantation, peri-implant capsules were harvested and examined histologically and by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The average capsular thickness was 371.2 \u03bcm in the simvastatin group and 491.2 \u03bcm in the control group. The fibrosis ratio was significantly different, with 32.33% in the simvastatin group and 58.44% in the control group (P < 0.001). Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 gene expression decreased significantly in the simvastatin group compared to the control group (P < 0.001). This study shows that simvastatin reduces radiation-induced capsular fibrosis around silicone implants in rats. This finding offers an alternative therapeutic strategy for reducing capsular fibrosis and contracture after implant-based breast reconstruction.", 
    "10": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal co-dominant genetic disorder characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease. It is under-diagnosed, yet early detection and treatment are critical to limit premature atherosclerotic disease. High-intensity statins are the mainstay of treatment, which should be started as early as possible in homozygous FH and as soon as the diagnosis of heterozygous FH is made in adults. Combination therapy is often necessary in FH patients and can include the addition of ezetimibe and bile acid sequestrants. Lipoprotein apheresis is used when pharmacotherapy is inadequate, especially for those with homozygous FH and some patients with severe heterozygous FH. Mipomersen and lomitapide are also indicated for patients with homozygous FH. The recently approved PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, are a promising treatment and outcome studies are ongoing. This article reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of FH.",

Smaller relative effects on major vascular events were observed as eGFR declined (p=0\u00b7008 for trend; RR 0\u00b778, 99% CI 0\u00b775-0\u00b782 for eGFR \u226560 mL/min per 1\u00b773 m(2); 0\u00b776, 0\u00b770-0\u00b781 for eGFR 45 to <60 mL/min per 1\u00b773 m(2); 0\u00b785, 0\u00b775-0\u00b796 for eGFR 30 to <45 mL/min per 1\u00b773 m(2); 0\u00b785, 0\u00b771-1\u00b702 for eGFR <30 mL/min per 1\u00b773 m(2) and not on dialysis; and 0\u00b794, 0\u00b779-1\u00b711 for patients on dialysis). Analogous trends by baseline renal function were seen for major coronary events (p=0\u00b701 for trend) and vascular mortality (p=0\u00b703 for trend), but there was no significant trend for coronary revascularisation (p=0\u00b790). Reducing LDL cholesterol with statin-based therapy had no effect on non-vascular mortality, irrespective of eGFR.", 
    "14": "Even after allowing for the smaller reductions in LDL cholesterol achieved by patients with more advanced chronic kidney disease, and for differences in outcome definitions between dialysis trials, the relative reductions in major vascular events observed with statin-based treatment became smaller as eGFR declined, with little evidence of benefit in patients on dialysis. In patients with chronic kidney disease, statin-based regimens should be chosen to maximise the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol to achieve the largest treatment benefits.",

Despite the reduction in cardiovascular events and mortality achieved by statin therapy, significant residual risk remains, especially in severe hereditary hypercholesterolemia, such as familial hypercholesterolemia. Some new strategies to achieve even lower LDL levels are now available, including the addition of cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe, and the recently available Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibodies.

    "17": "Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor used as a first-line treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it has shown modest to low response rates. The characteristic tumour hypoxia of advanced HCC maybe a major factor underlying hypoxia-mediated treatment failure. Thus, it is urgent to elucidate the mechanisms of hypoxia-mediated sorafenib resistance in HCC. In this study, we found that hypoxia induced the nuclear translocation of Yes associate-Protein (YAP) and the subsequent transactivation of target genes that promote cell survival and escape apoptosis, thereby leading to sorafenib resistance. Statins, the inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, could ameliorate hypoxia-induced nuclear translocation of YAP and suppress mRNA levels of YAP target genes both in vivo and in vitro. Combined treatment of statins with sorafenib greatly rescued the loss of anti-proliferative effects of sorafenib under hypoxia and improved the inhibitory effects on HepG2 xenograft tumour growth, accompanied by enhanced apoptosis as evidenced by the increased sub-G1 population and PARP cleavage. The expression levels of YAP and its target genes were highly correlated with poor prognosis and predicted a high risk of HCC patients. These findings collectively suggest that statins utilization maybe a promising new strategy to counteract hypoxia-mediated resistance to sorafenib in HCC patients.",

This study was conducted to assess the prices and pharmaceutical quality of innovator atorvastatin 20 mg with its locally available generics in Palestine and to assess the suitability of their interchangeability. The prices of innovator and generic atorvastatin 20 mg were determined and compared. Innovator atorvastatin and four generic products were tested for their pharmaceutical quality. Tablets were tested for their drug contents, weight uniformity, hardness, disintegration and dissolution. Three out of four generics were less expensive than the innovator. Pharmaceutical quality assessments were satisfactory and within limits for all atorvastatin tested products. The average weight ranged from 206.6 \u00b1 8.40 to 330 \u00b1 3.92 mg and the %RSDs were within the permitted limits as per USP. Tablet hardness ranged from 102 \u00b1 1.41 to 197.4 \u00b1 6.88 kg and drug contents ranged from 92.2% to 105.3%. All products disintegrated within permitted time limits and showed very rapid dissolution. Products released more than 85% of their drug contents in less than 15 min. Our results showed that all tested innovator and generic atorvastatin products were of good pharmaceutical quality. Despite the lack of in vivo evaluation, our results indicate that these products are equivalent in vitro. Considering the in vitro release characteristics, these products might be used interchangeably. However, regulatory authorities permit the use of in vitro data in establishing similarity between immediate release oral dosage forms containing biopharmaceutical classification system class I and III drugs only.",

Some statins, such as simvastatin (simvastatin), have been shown to have anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory effects, reducing cartilage degradation in osteoarthritic rabbits in vivo. However, the regulatory mechanisms undergirding simvastatin mediated chondrocyte differentiation have not been well elucidated. Thus, we investigated the action and mechanism of simvastatin on differentiation of rabbit articular chondrocytes through western blot analyses, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Simvastatin treatment was found to induce type II collagen expression and sulfated-proteoglycan synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Indeed, RT-PCR revealed increased expression of type II collagen on treatment with simvastatin. Both IHC and IF staining indicated differentiation of chondrocytes. Simvastatin treatment reduced activation of ERK-1/2 and stimulated activation of p38 kinase. Inhibition of ERK-1/2 with PD98059 enhanced simvastatin induced differentiation, whereas inhibition of p38 kinase with SB203580 inhibited simvastatin induced differentiation. Simvastatin treatment also inhibits loss of type II collagen in serial monolayer culture. Collectively, our results indicate that ERK-1/2 and p38 kinase regulate simvastatin-induced differentiation of chondrocytes in opposing manners. Thus, these findings suggest that simvastatin may be a potential therapeutic drug for osteoarthritis.",

    "53": "Efferocytosis (the phagocytosis of apoptotic self cells) is a key mechanism in the resolution of inflammatory processes such as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Efferocytosis therefore represents a modifiable target for therapy aimed at enhancing intrinsic recovery mechanisms. It is currently not known which patients recovering from CAP would mostly benefit from a strategy aimed at enhancing efferocytosis.", 
    "54": "We recruited a cohort of patients with CAP admitted to a hospital in Liverpool. One month into recovery, subjects were invited for research bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. An ex vivo efferocytosis assay was performed by challenging alveolar macrophages with autologous, apoptotic neutrophils. The percentage of alveolar macrophages that had undergone efferocytosis was determined by flow cytometry. We conducted a multivariable regression using a linear mixed effects model to determine which clinical parameters were most closely associated with efferocytosis.", 
    "55": "We observed high rates of comorbidity among this CAP cohort. Efferocytosis was measured in 22 subjects. We assessed multiple combinations of clinical parameters for association with efferocytosis and found the best-fitting model included an interaction between smoking status and prior statin use-smoking being associated with decreased efferocytosis and statin use with increased efferocytosis. These effects were modified by an association between efferocytosis and body mass index (BMI), such that as BMI increased so did efferocytosis.", 
    "56": "This is the first study to measure efferocytosis in patients recovering from CAP. The results suggest that smokers with low BMI have impaired efferocytosis and may benefit from a statin to boost recovery.", 
    "57": "The development of diabetic nephropathy (DN) relays mainly on control of blood glucose and restrains hyperglycemic-induced oxidative stress. Hence, the effect administration of resveratrol (RSV) (5mg/kg) alone or in combination with rosuvastatin (RSU) (10mg/kg) on development and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) was evaluated. Oral treatment of diabetic rats with RSV alone or co-administered with RSU improved renal dysfunction indicated by a significant decrease in serum creatinine, urinary protein and urinary TGF-\u03b21 when compared with diabetic control rats. Also, a significant increase in body weight, relative kidney weight with a significant decrease in serum glucose and glycated hemoglobin in diabetic treated groups when compared with diabetic control group. Hyperglycemic-induced oxidative stress in diabetic control rats indicated by a significant decrease in renal activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione level with a significant increase in malondialdehyde levels. However, oral treatment of diabetic rats with RSV alone or co-administered with RSU improved the antioxidant status back to control values. Similarly, mRNA analysis of quantitative real time-PCR substantiated that RSV with RSU notably normalizes the renal expression of TGF-\u03b21, fibronectin, NF-\u03baB/p65, Nrf2, Sirt1 and FoxO1 in the diabetic group of rats. The histopathological observations of the combined treated diabetic rats effectively protect the kidneys from hyperglycemic-induced oxidative damage. These findings confirmed the renoprotective effects of RSV with RSU treatment through improving glycemic control and attenuating oxidative stress damage in renal tissues of diabetic rats.",

Moreover, Bay (a NF-\u03baB inhibitor) treatment greatly suppressed the expression of NLRP3, the cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2 in PMA-induced THP-1 cells, suggesting that the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway takes part in regulating the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, atorvastatin markedly inhibited the up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and the activation of nuclear factor kappa b (NF-\u03baB) in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells.",

Results showed newly deranged liver function and creatine kinase (CK) of >24\u2005000. Prior medical history includes previous myocardial infarction and recurrent urinary tract infection. 4 days prior to symptom onset, the patient developed typical urinary tract infection symptoms, treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient had been taking simvastatin (40\u2005mg nocte) for 13\u2005years and had never previously taken ciprofloxacin. Initial management included intravenous crystalloid fluids and discontinuation of simvastatin. CK level fell, liver function slowly improved and renal function remained stable. Muscle weakness improved and the patient became independently able to perform activities of daily living. While the interactions between statins and other antibiotics are well documented, the interaction between statins and ciprofloxacin is less so. The consequences of this interaction can have potentially serious outcomes.",

Multinomial regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between exposure to fine particulate matter <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide on coronary artery disease severity at baseline and risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or all-cause mortality over 3\u00a0years of follow-up. Among participants with coronary artery disease, exposure to PM2.5 levels was associated with increased likelihood of having coronary atherosclerosis that was mild (odds ratio 1.43, 95% CI 1.11-1.83, P=0.005) and severe (odds ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.26-2.11, P<0.0001), with the effect on severe coronary artery disease being significantly increased compared with mild disease (Ptrend=0.03). Exposure to higher PM2.5 levels was also significantly associated with increased risk of incident myocardial infarction (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.73, P=0.03) but not stroke or all-cause mortality. The association of PM2.5 with incident myocardial infarction was not affected after adjustment for Framingham Adult Treatment Panel\u00a0III (ATP III) risk score or statin therapy. In comparison, there were no significant associations between nitrogen dioxide levels and all-cause mortality or risk of stroke after adjustment for Framingham ATP III risk score.",

    "66": "The beneficial effects of statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is not merely explained by the lipid-modulating effects. Although adipokines levels have been associated with cardiometabolic disorders, a few studies have explored the effect of statin on resistin and visfatin. We aimed to evaluate the impact of statin therapy on levels of resistin and visfatin through a meta-analysis of published studies. A systematic literature search in Medline and SCOPUS databases was conducted up to January 2015 to identify controlled trials assessing changes in plasma concentrations of visfatin and resistin during treatment with statins. Quantitative data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model, with weighed mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as summary statistics. 12 eligible studies with 14 treatment arms were included. Overall, 844 participants were studied. No significant change in plasma resistin concentrations was observed following statin therapy (WMD: -0.11ng/mL, CI: -1.94,1.73, p=0.909). This effect was robust and not affected by statin type, treatment duration and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. With respect to visfatin concentrations, there was a marginally significant reduction following statin therapy (WMD: -2.40ng/mL, CI: -4.79,-0.002, p=0.050). However, this effect size was weak and sensitive to three of the trials included in the analysis. This meta-analysis did not suggest any effect of statin therapy on plasma resistin levels, while a slight reduction in visfatin levels was found. The effect of statins on visfatin levels may represent a novel pleiotropic characteristic of these drugs.", 
    "67": "Statins are a class of molecules that inhibit HMG CoA reductase. They are usually prescribed as a lipid lowering medication. However, there is accumulating evidence that statins have multiple secondary effects both related and unrelated to their lipid-lowering effect. This narrative review of the literature aims to provide the reader with information from clinical studies related to the effect of statin and statins' potential use in patients with liver diseases. In patients with advanced liver disease due to any etiology, statins exhibit an antifibrotic effect possibly through the prevention of hepatic sinusoidal microthrombosis. Two randomized controlled trials confirmed that statins decrease hepatic vein pressure gradient in patients with portal hypertension and improve the survival of patients after variceal bleeding. Lower rates of infections were observed in patients with cirrhosis who received statin treatment. Statins decrease the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with advanced liver disease in general but particularly in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. Statins in patients with chronic hepatitis C likely increase the virological response to the treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and have the potential to decrease the rate of fibrosis. Finally, data from randomized controlled trials also confirmed that the addition of statin prolongs the survival of patients with advanced HCC even more than sorafenib. Statins are a very promising group of drugs especially in patients with liver disease, where therapeutic options can often be limited. Some indications, such as the prevention of re-bleeding from esophageal varices and the palliative treatment of HCC have been proven through randomized controlled trials, while additional indications still need to be confirmed through prospective studies.", 
    "68": "Atorvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering statin that has been shown to exert several pleiotropic effects in the nervous system as a neuroprotective and antidepressant-like agent. Antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin in mice is mediated by glutamatergic and serotoninergic receptors, although the precise intracellular signaling pathways involved are unknown. PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2/mTOR signaling pathway has been associated to neurobiology of depression and seems to be modulated by some pharmacological antidepressant strategies. The present study investigated the participation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2/mTOR signaling pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of an acute atorvastatin treatment in mice. Atorvastatin sub-effective (0.01\u00a0mg/kg) or effective (0.1\u00a0mg/kg) doses in the tail suspension test (TST) was administered orally alone or in combination with PI3K, GSK-3\u03b2 or mTOR inhibitors. The administration of PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (10\u00a0nmol/site, i.c.v) completely prevented the antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin (0.1\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.). The participation of GSK-3\u03b2 in the antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin was demonstrated by co-administration of a sub-effective dose of atorvastatin (0.01\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) with AR-A014418 (0.01\u00a0\u03bcg/site, i.c.v., a selective GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor) or with lithium chloride (10\u00a0mg/kg, p.o., a non-selective GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitor). The mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (0.2\u00a0nmol/site, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent atorvastatin (0.1\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) antidepressant-like effect. These behavioral findings were supported by neurochemical observations, as atorvastatin treatment increased the immunocontent of the phosphorylated isoforms of Akt, GSK-3\u03b2 and mTOR in the hippocampus of mice. Taken together, our results suggest an involvement of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2/mTOR signaling pathway in the antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin in mice.", 
    "69": "Twenty castrated Boer crossbred goats were used in the present study with two treatments to examine the effect of dietary replacement of ordinary rice with red yeast rice on nutrient utilization, enteric methane emission and ruminal archaea structure and composition. Two treatment diets contained (DM basis) 70.0% of forage, 21.8% of concentrates and 8.2% of either ordinary rice (control) or red yeast rice (RYR). Nutrient utilization was measured and enteric methane emissions were determined in respiration chambers. Results showed that RYR had significantly lower digestibility of N and organic matter compared to control group. However, feeding red yeast rice did not affect N retention as g/d or a proportion of N intake, and reduced heat production as MJ/d or as a proportion of metabolizable energy intake, thus leading to a higher proportion of metabolizable energy intake to be retained in body tissue. RYR also had significantly lower methane emissions either as g/d, or as a proportion of feed intake. Although feeding red yeast rice had no negative effect on any rumen fermentation variables, it decreased serum contents of total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. In the present study, 75616 archaeal sequences were generated and clustered into 2364 Operational Taxonomic Units. At the genus level, the predominant archaea in the rumen of goats was Methanobrevibacter, which was significantly inhibited with the supplementation of red yeast rice. In conclusion, red yeast rice is a potential feed ingredient for mitigation of enteric methane emissions of goats. However, caution should be taken when it is used because it may inhibit the digestibility of some nutrients. Further studies are required to evaluate its potential with different diets and animal species, as well as its effects on animal health and food safety.",

    "77": "Many drugs and other xenobiotics may reach systemic concentrations where they interact not only with the proteins that are their therapeutic targets but also modify the physicochemical properties of the cell membrane, which may lead to altered function of many transmembrane proteins beyond the intended targets. These changes in bilayer properties may contribute to nonspecific, promiscuous changes in membrane protein and cell function because membrane proteins are energetically coupled to their host lipid bilayer. It is thus important, for both pharmaceutical and biophysical reasons, to understand the bilayer-modifying effect of amphiphiles (including therapeutic agents). Here we use atomic force microscopy topography imaging and nanomechanical mapping to monitor the effect of statins, a family of hypolipidemic drugs, on synthetic lipid membranes. Our results reveal that statins alter the nanomechanical stability of the bilayers and increase their elastic moduli depending on the lipid bilayer order. Our results also suggest that statins increase bilayer heterogeneity, which may indicate that statins form nanometer-sized aggregates in the membrane. This is further evidence that changes in bilayer nanoscale mechanical properties may be a signature of lipid bilayer-mediated effects of amphiphilic drugs.",

Diabetic hyperlipemic group demonstrated significant hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and increased inflammation, oxidative stress, calcification, and finally atherogenesis progression. Treatment of diabetic hyperlipemic rats with, policosanol, omega-3 fatty acids (natural products) and atorvastatin for eight weeks significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Vitamin D, decreased aortic vacuoles number, and inhibited calcification process. Policosanol induced more remarkable reduction in the density and number of foam cells and improved the intimal lesions of the aorta as compared to atorvastatin.

Patients were included in the guideline implementation cohort if they had a medical claim with an ICD-9-CM diagnosis of ASCVD in the year before the November 2013 ACC/AHA guideline release. The index date was defined as the first outpatient medical claim with an ICD-9-CM for ASCVD in the first 6 months after the guideline was released. Patients were required to have continuous enrollment for \u2265 1 year before and after the index date. These same criteria were applied to patients exactly 4 years earlier to identify a historical control group. Patients meeting these criteria formed the antihyperlipidemic treatment patterns cohort. Of these, patients who also had \u22651 pharmacy claim for a statin in the 1-year pre- and post-index periods were included in the statin adherence cohort. Antihyperlipidemic treatment patterns were assessed using pharmacy claims for antihyperlipidemic medications in the 1-year pre- and post-index periods. Antihyperlipidemic medication claims were classified as a nonstatin cholesterol medication, low-intensity statin, moderate-intensity statin, or high-intensity statin. To address differences in pre-index antihyperlipidemic medications between the guideline implementation and historical control groups, patients were randomly matched 1:1 based on pre-index classification in a post hoc analysis. Post-index antihyperlipidemic classifications were compared between groups using a Stuart-Maxwell test.

In the matched cohort, there was a significant difference in the post-index antihyperlipidemic classification (P < 0.001), which appeared to be a result of the difference in nonstatin cholesterol medications (guideline 6.9% vs. historical 13.0%) and high-intensity statins (guideline 23.7% vs. historical 16.3%). Of the 1,841 patients in the antihyperlipidemic treatment patterns cohort, 919 patients met inclusion criteria for the statin adherence analysis.

    "120": "BACKGROUND Is the timing of dosing for amlodipine and atorvastatin important with regard to therapeutic efficacy? To answer this question, we designed an outpatient, practice-based, case-control study lasting 8 weeks. MATERIAL AND METHODS Two hundred patients were divided into 2 groups: in Group I, patients were provided with a single pill containing amlodipine/atorvastatin (5/20 mg) to be taken each night at 10 pm, and in Group II, patients were taking amlodipine (5 mg) and atorvastatin (20 mg) each morning at 7 am. RESULTS Our results indicated no obvious difference in blood pressure control between the 2 groups. Taking amlodipine at night not only lowered blood pressure, but it also provided better control during the peak blood pressure in the morning. Hypercholesterolemia control in the 2 groups was also not significantly different, taking atorvastatin in the morning was as effective as dosing at night in patients with hypercholesterolemia. While the carotid IMT, hs-CRP, and LVMI were significantly lower after treatment, no differences were found between the 2 groups. Although no obvious difference was found in adverse drug reactions between the 2 groups, compliance was much better in the single-pill group than in patients taking the 2 medications separately. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, single-pill amlodipine-atorvastatin taken at night can lower blood pressure and reduce the morning peak blood pressure levels the next day. Additionally, this dosing method could improve patient adherence to the therapy.", 
    "121": "Fusidic acid (FA), which was approved in the 1960s in many European and Asian countries, has gained renewed interest due to its continued effectiveness against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus As rhabdomyolysis has been reported upon coadministration of FA with statins, we aimed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to FA-statin drug-drug interactions. Because of the association between rhabdomyolysis and increased exposure to statins, we investigated if cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and transporters involved in the disposition of various statins are inhibited by FA. FA was found to inhibit BCRP and OATP1B1 but not P-gp. In overexpressing cell systems, FA inhibited BCRP-mediated efflux (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50], \u223c50 to 110 \u03bcM) and OATP1B1-mediated uptake (IC50, \u223c4 to 35 \u03bcM) of statins at clinically relevant concentrations achievable in the intestine and liver (based on a 550-mg oral dose of FA, the expected maximum theoretical gastrointestinal concentration is \u223c4 mM, and the maximum total or unbound concentration in the inlet to the liver was reported to be up to 223 \u03bcM or 11 \u03bcM, respectively, upon multiple dosing). Similarly, FA inhibited metabolism of statins in human liver microsomes (IC50, \u223c17 to 195 \u03bcM). These data suggest that FA inhibits at least 3 major dispositional pathways (BCRP, OATP1B1, and CYP3A) and thus affects the clearance of several statins. We confirmed that FA is eliminated via phase 1 metabolism (primarily via CYP3A); however, there is also some phase 2 metabolism (mediated primarily by UGT1A1). Taken together, these data provide evidence for molecular mechanisms that may explain the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis when FA is administered with statins.", 
    "122": "There is sufficient evidence that statins have a protective role against breast cancer proliferation and recurrence, but treatment predictive biomarkers are lacking. Breast cancer cell lines displaying diverse sensitivity to atorvastatin were subjected to global transcriptional profiling and genes significantly altered by statin treatment were identified. Atorvastatin treatment strongly inhibited proliferation in estrogen receptor (ER) negative cell lines and a commensurate response was also evident on the genome-wide transcriptional scale, with ER negative cells displaying a robust deregulation of genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Interestingly, atorvastatin upregulated genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in all cell lines, irrespective of sensitivity to statin treatment. However, the level of pathway induction; measured as the fold change in transcript levels, was inversely correlated to the effect of statin treatment on cell growth. High expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes before treatment was associated with resistance to statin therapy in cell lines and clinical biopsies. Furthermore, high expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes was independently prognostic for a shorter recurrence-free and overall survival, especially among ER positive tumors. Dysregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis is therefore predictive for both sensitivity to anti-cancer statin therapy and prognosis following primary breast cancer diagnosis.", 
    "123": "The use of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering medications has led to a significant reduction of cardiovascular risk in both primary and secondary prevention. Statin therapy, one of the cornerstones for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), has been demonstrated to be effective in lowering LDL-C levels and in reducing the risk for CVD and is generally well-tolerated. However, compliance with statins remains suboptimal. One of the main reasons is limitations by adverse events, notably myopathies, which can lead to non-compliance with the prescribed statin regimen. Reducing the burden of elevated LDL-C levels is critical in patients with CVD as well as in patients with very high baseline levels of LDL-C (e.g. patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia), as statin therapy is insufficient for optimally reducing LDL-C below target values. In this review, we discuss alternative treatment options after maximally tolerated doses of statin therapy, including ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors. Difficult-to-treat patients may benefit from combination therapy with ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor (evolocumab or alirocumab, which are now available). Updates of treatment guidelines are needed to guide the management of patients who will best benefit from these new treatments.",

The present study proposed a simple and effective therapeutic strategy for diabetic skin ulcers-in situ up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and NO synthesis by statin-loaded tissue engineering scaffold (TES). In vitro experiments on human umbilical vein endothelial cells indicated that the statin-loaded TES relieved the high-glucose induced decrease in cell viability and promoted NO synthesis under high-glucose conditions. In a rat model of diabetes, the statin-loaded TES promoted eNOS expression and NO synthesis in/around the regenerated tissues. Subsequently, accelerated vascularization and elevated blood supply were observed, followed by rapid wound healing. These findings suggest that the in situ up-regulation of eNOS/NO by a statin-loaded TES may be a useful therapeutic method for intractable diabetic skin wounds.",

The cellular mechanisms behind the development of diabetes by statins are elusive. Here we have treated mice on normal diet (ND) and high fat diet (HFD) with rosuvastatin. Under ND rosuvastatin lowered blood glucose through improved insulin sensitivity and increased glucose uptake in adipose tissue. In vitro rosuvastatin reduced insulin secretion and insulin content in islets. In the beta cell Ca(2+) signaling was impaired and the density of granules at the plasma membrane was increased by rosuvastatin treatment. HFD mice developed insulin resistance and increased insulin secretion prior to administration of rosuvastatin. Treatment with rosuvastatin decreased the compensatory insulin secretion and increased glucose uptake. In conclusion, our data shows dual effects on glucose homeostasis by rosuvastatin where insulin sensitivity is improved, but beta cell function is impaired.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS Two cross-sectional surveys of the random samples of the Polish population\u00a0were performed in the years 2003-2005 (WOBASZ) and 2013-2014 (WOBASZ II). Interviews were carried\u00a0out according to a standard questionnaire. Blood lipid levels were determined in a single laboratory\u00a0in frozen samples using the enzymatic colorimetric method. RESULTS The analysis included 14151 participants aged 20-74 years (WOBASZ) and 5947 participants\u00a0aged 20-99 years (WOBASZ II). In the 2013-2014 survey, hypercholesterolemia was found in 70.3% of\u00a0men and 64.3% of women. Isolated hypertriglyceridemia was found in 5.6% of men and 2.4% of women.\u00a0Isolated low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were found in 5.1% of men and in\u00a07.3% of women. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia did not change significantly with regards to\u00a0the 2003-2005 survey. An increase in the prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia was found in men (relative\u00a0ratio [RR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.55), and an increase in the prevalence of low\u00a0HDL-C levels was observed in both sexes (men: RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.77-2.88; women: RR, 1.94; 95% CI,\u00a01.61-2.33). There was an increase in the proportion of persons receiving high- or moderate-intensity\u00a0statin therapy. However, 60,6% of persons with hypercholesterolemia were not aware of their condition,\u00a0and only 6% were treated and achieved the treatment target.\u00a0 CONCLUSIONS There is an urgent need for more effective strategies for the prevention and management\u00a0of dyslipidemias.",

It is important to understand the impact of processes such as membrane permeability, partitioning, and active transport on intracellular drug concentrations. The present study aimed to predict intracellular unbound atorvastatin concentrations and characterize the effect of enzyme-transporter interplay on these concentrations. Single-pass liver perfusion studies were conducted in rats using atorvastatin (ATV, 1 \u00b5M) alone at 4\u00b0C and at 37\u00b0C in presence of rifampin (RIF, 20 \u00b5M) and 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT, 1 mM), separately and in combination. The unbound intracellular ATV concentration was predicted with a five-compartment explicit membrane model using the parameterized diffusional influx clearance, active basolateral uptake clearance, and metabolic clearance. Chemical inhibition of uptake and metabolism at 37\u00b0C proved to be better controls relative to studies at 4\u00b0C. The predicted unbound intracellular concentration at the end of the 50-minute perfusion in the +ABT , +ABT+RIF, and the ATV-only groups was 6.5 \u00b5M, 0.58 \u00b5M, and 5.14 \u00b5M, respectively. The predicted total liver concentrations and amount recovered in bile were within 0.94-1.3 fold of the observed value in all groups. The fold difference in total liver concentration did not always extrapolate to the fold difference in predicted unbound concentration across groups. Together, these results support the use of compartmental modeling to predict intracellular concentrations in dynamic organ-based systems. These predictions can provide insight into the role of uptake transporters and metabolizing enzymes in determining drug tissue concentrations.",

In this study, we demonstrated the oncogenic role of HMGR in colorectal cancer (CRC) by disclosing increased HMGR activity in CRC patients and its enhancement of anti-apoptosis and stemness. Our previous studies showed that statins containing carboxylic acid chains possessed activity against histone deacetylases (HDACs), and strengthened their anti-HDAC activity through designing HMGR-HDAC dual inhibitors, JMF compounds. These compounds exerted anti-cancer effect in CRC cells as well as in AOM-DSS and Apc(Min/+) CRC mouse models. JMF mostly regulated the genes related to apoptosis and inflammation through genome-wide ChIP-on-chip analysis, and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) predicted their respective regulation by NR3C1 and NF-\u03baB. Furthermore, JMF inhibited metastasis, angiogenesis and cancer stemness, and potentiated the effect of oxaliplatin in CRC mouse models.

In the present study, the expression levels of egfl7 and that of ICAM-1 as a marker of endothelium activation, were evaluated in peritumoral vessels of human breast cancer samples. Breast cancer samples (174 invasive and 30 in situ) from 204 patients treated in 2005 were immunostained for CD31, ICAM-1 and stained for egfl7 using in situ hybridization. The expression levels of ICAM-1 and egfl7 were assessed in peritumoral areas using semi-quantitative scales. There was a strong and significant inverse correlation between the expression of ICAM-1 and that of egfl7 in CD31(+) blood vessels. When the ICAM-1 score increased, the egfl7 score reduced significantly (P=0.004), and vice-versa (Cuzick's test for trend across ordered groups). In order to determine which gene influenced the other gene between egfl7 and ICAM-1, the expression levels of either gene were modulated in endothelial cells. Egfl7 regulated ICAM-1 expression while ICAM-1 had no effects on egfl7 expression in the same conditions. Altogether, these results provide further results that egfl7 serves a regulatory role in endothelial cell activation in relation to immune infiltration and that it is a potential therapeutic target to consider for improving anticancer immunotherapies.",

The impact of replacing the PCE with either the modified Framingham Risk Score (FRS) or the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) on assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment and statin eligibility remains unknown. We assessed the comparative benefits of using the PCE, FRS, and SCORE for ASCVD risk assessment in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Of 6,815 participants, 654 (mean age 61.4 \u00b1 10.3; 47.1% men; 37.1% whites; 27.2% blacks; 22.3% Hispanics; 12.0% Chinese-Americans) were included in analysis.

Several studies have shown that the reduction in cardiovascular (CV) events is proportional to the absolute LDL-C lowering achieved with statins. In the quest for further reduction in LDL-C and CV events, new drugs that mainly support statin action have emerged. Since 2003, with the discovery of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which is a key factor in the LDL clearance pathway, new modalities, mainly in the form of monoclonal antibodies that block this protein (PCSK9 inhibitors), have reached phase III of clinical development with very promising efficacy and safety data. With a mean further reduction of LDL-C levels of \u223c60% beyond that achieved with statins, the PCSK9 inhibitors set the bar even lower in terms of LDL-C levels. This review manuscript addresses important questions about the efficacy, safety and clinical use of PCSK9 inhibitors to evaluate the role of these agents in reducing CV risk.", 
    "167": "The cholesterol synthesis inhibitor simvastatin, which is used to treat cardiovascular diseases, has severe collateral effects. We decided to comprehensively study the effects of simvastatin in zebrafish development and in myogenesis, because zebrafish has been used as a model to human diseases, due to its handling easiness, the optical clarity of its embryos, and the availability of physiological and structural methodologies. Furthermore, muscle is an important target of the drug. We used several simvastatin concentrations at different zebrafish developmental stages and studied survival rate, morphology, and physiology of the embryos. Our results show that high levels of simvastatin induce structural damage whereas low doses induce minor structural changes, impaired movements, and reduced heart beating. Morphological alterations include changes in embryo and somite size and septa shape. Physiological changes include movement reduction and slower heartbeat. These effects could be reversed by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. Moreover, we quantified the total cell number during zebrafish development and demonstrated a large reduction in cell number after statin treatment. Since we could classify the alterations induced by simvastatin in three distinct phenotypes, we speculate that simvastatin acts through more than one mechanism and could affect both cell replication and/or cell death and muscle function. Our data can contribute to the understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of the mechanisms of action of simvastatin.",

Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is a component of TRLs that elevates plasma triglycerides (TGs) through delaying the lipolysis of TGs and the catabolism of TRL remnants. Recent human genetics approaches have shown that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in APOC3, the gene encoding apoC-III, lower plasma TGs and protect from CAD. This observation has spawned new interest in therapeutic efforts to target apoC-III. Here, we briefly review both currently available as well as developing therapies for reducing apoC-III levels and function to lower TGs and cardiovascular risk. These therapies include existing options including statins, fibrates, thiazolidinediones, omega-3-fatty acids, and niacin, as well as an antisense oligonucleotide targeting APOC3 currently in clinical development.

We previously reported that 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and reduces PI3K/Akt phosphorylation. This study investigated the mechanism underlying the downregulatory effects of 3-MC on nitric oxide (NO) production occurring through the AhR/RhoA/Akt-mediated mechanism. The mechanism underlying the effects of 3-MC on eNOS activity and blood pressure was examined in vitro and in vivo through genetic and pharmacological approaches. Results indicated that 3-MC modified heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), caveolin-1, dynein, and eNOS mRNA and protein expression through the AhR/RhoA-dependent mechanism in mouse cerebral vascular endothelial cells (MCVECs) and that 3-MC reduced eNOS phosphorylation through the AhR/RhoA-mediated inactivation of Akt1. The upregulation of dynein expression was associated with decreased eNOS dimer formation (eNOS dimer; an activated form of the enzyme). Coimmunoprecipitation assay results indicated that 3-MC significantly reduced the interaction between eNOS and its regulatory proteins, including Akt1 and HSP90, but increased the interaction between eNOS and caveolin-1. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis revealed that 3-MC reduced the amount of membrane-bound activated eNOS, and a modified Griess assay revealed that 3-MC concomitantly reduced NO production. However, simvastatin reduced 3-MC-mediated murine hypertension. Our study results indicate that AhR, RhoA, and eNOS have major roles in blood pressure regulation.

Sprague Dawley rats were Ovx or sham-operated (Sham) and kept sedentary for 8 weeks under a standard diet. Thereafter, rats were transferred for three weeks in running wheel cages for Tr or kept sedentary (Sed) with or without Ros treatment (5mg/kg/day). Six groups were formed: Sham-Sed treated with saline (Sal) or Ros (Sham-Sed-Sal; Sham-Sed-Ros), Ovx-Sed treated with Sal or Ros (Ovx-Sed-Sal; Ovx-Sed-Ros), Ovx trained treated with Sal or Ros (Ovx-Tr-Sal; Ovx-Tr-Ros). Ovx-Sed-Sal rats depicted higher (P < 0.05) body weight, plasma total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C, and liver TC content compared to Sham-Sed-Sal rats. In contrast, mRNA levels of liver PCSK9, LDLR, LRP-1 as well as plasma PCSK9 concentrations and protein levels of LRP-1 were reduced (P < 0.01) in Ovx-Sed-Sal compared to Sham-Sed-Sal rats. However, protein levels of LDLR increased (P < 0.05) in Ovx-Sed-Sal compared to Sham-Sed-Sal rats. Treatment of Ovx rats with Ros increased (P < 0.05) mRNA and protein levels of LRP-1 and PCSK9 but not mRNA levels of LDLR, while its protein abundance was reduced at the level of Sham rats. As a result, plasma LDL-C was not reduced. Exercise alone did not affect the expression of any of these markers in Ovx rats. Overall, Ros treatment corrected Ovx-induced decrease in gene expression of markers of cholesterol metabolism in liver of Ovx rats, but without reducing plasma LDL-C concentrations. Increased plasma PCSK9 levels could be responsible for the reduction of liver LDLR protein abundance and the absence of reduction of plasma LDL-C after Ros treatment.",

Eighty nine subjects with full or partial remission of multiple myeloma were enrolled in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on whether or not statins were included in their treatment: a statin group (n=43) and a no statin group (n=46). Among the 43 patients in the statin group, 31 patients received 20mg/day atorvastatin and 12 patients received 40-mg/day atorvastatin. None of the patients had received any lipid-modulating medications, including statins or fibrates, before enrollment. Observation period was up to 1 year. Blood samples for biomarkers measurements were collected. ELISA method for measurements of circulating level of galectin-3, interleukin-6 and NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide were used. Lipid lowering effect in statin user was associates with declined serum Gal-3 level, whereas in not statin users similar response was not appeared.

Antibody arrays indicated high levels of chemokine (C motif) ligand (XCL1) secretion by cocultured WJ-MSCs and XCL1 protein treatment resulted in complete inhibition of apoptosis in serum-starved C2C12 cells. Apoptosis of C2C12 cells and loss of differentiated C2C12 myotubes induced by lovastatin, another muscle cell death inducer, was also inhibited by XCL1 treatment. However, XCL1 treatment did not inhibit apoptosis of cell lines other than C2C12. When XCL1-siRNA pretreated WJ-MSCs were cocultured with serum-starved C2C12 cells, apoptosis was not inhibited, thus confirming that XCL1 is a key factor in preventing C2C12 cell apoptosis. We demonstrated the therapeutic effect of XCL1 on the zebrafish myopathy model, generated by knock down of a causative gene ADSSL1. Furthermore, the treatment of XCL1 resulted in significant recovery of the zebrafish skeletal muscle defects.

Cholesterol synthesis was pharmacologically (fluvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin treatment) and genetically (HMGCR\u2011RNAi) inhibited, in uninfected and DENV2\u2011infected hepatoma Huh\u20117 cells. The cholesterol levels, DENV titer and cellular antiviral expression profile were evaluated. A reduction in the DENV titer, measured as plaque forming units, was observed in DENV\u2011infected cells following 48\u00a0h treatment with 10\u00a0\u00b5M fluvastatin, 10\u00a0\u00b5M atorvastatin, 20\u00a0\u00b5M lovastatin and 20\u00a0\u00b5M simvastatin, which achieved 70, 70, 65 and 55% DENV2 inhibition, respectively, compared with the untreated cells. In addition, the cytopathic effect was reduced in the statin\u2011treated DENV\u2011infected cells. Statins simultaneously reduced cholesterol levels at 48\u00a0h, with the exception of DENV2 infected cells. Genetic inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was performed using RNA interference for 3\u2011hydroxy\u20113\u2011methylglutaryl\u2011CoA reductase (HMGCR\u2011siRNA), which indicated a slight reduction in DENV2 titer at 48\u00a0h post\u2011infection, however, with no significant reduction in cholesterol levels. In addition, DENV2 infection was observed to augment the intracellular cholesterol levels in all experimental conditions. Comparison between the cellular antiviral response triggered by DENV2 infection, statin treatment and HMGCR\u2011siRNA in infected, uninfected, treated and untreated Huh7 cells, showed different expression profiles for the antiviral genes evaluated. All downregulating cholesterol agents evaluated reduced the expression of genes associated with cellular immune and pro\u2011inflammatory responses. These results indicate that statin-mediated downregulation of DENV2 infectious particles number is independent of cholesterol levels and it is partially mediated by the modulation of the cellular antiviral profile.",

    "238": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase (HL) deficiency is characterized by tissue accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric (HMG), and 3-methylglutaric (MGA) acids. Affected patients present cardiomyopathy, whose pathomechanisms are not yet established. We investigated the effects of HMG and MGA on energy and redox homeostasis in rat heart using in vivo and in vitro models. In vivo experiments showed that intraperitoneal administration of HMG and MGA decreased the activities of the respiratory chain complex II and creatine kinase (CK), whereas HMG also decreased the activity of complex II-III. Furthermore, HMG and MGA injection increased reactive species production and carbonyl formation, and decreased glutathione concentrations. Regarding the enzymatic antioxidant defenses, HMG and MGA increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, while only MGA diminished the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, as well as the protein content of SOD1. Pre-treatment with melatonin (MEL) prevented MGA-induced decrease of CK activity and SOD1 levels. In vitro results demonstrated that HMG and MGA increased reactive species formation, induced lipid peroxidation and decreased glutathione. We also verified that reactive species overproduction and glutathione decrease provoked by HMG and MGA were abrogated by MEL and lipoic acid (LA), while only MEL prevented HMG- and MGA-induced lipoperoxidation. Allopurinol (ALP) also prevented reactive species overproduction caused by both metabolites. Our data provide solid evidence that bioenergetics dysfunction and oxidative stress are induced by HMG and MGA in heart, which may explain the cardiac dysfunction observed in HL deficiency, and also suggest that antioxidant supplementation could be considered as adjuvant therapy for affected patients.",

    "240": "A 70-year-old woman received atorvastatin for hyperlipidaemia without any problem for 4 years. When intravenous fluconazole was added for treating a fungal infection, rhabdomyolysis developed 2 weeks later. Removal of atorvastatin led to the resolution of her rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "241": "Our case demonstrates that in some subjects even a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor such as fluconazole may lead to rhabdomyolysis in subjects receiving a statin.", 
    "242": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of 12\u2005weeks of atorvastatin treatment on myocardial fibrosis in patients with hypertension with atherosclerosis. 15 statin-na\u00efve participants (11 males; mean age 67\u00b110\u2005years) with atherosclerosis were given atorvastatin (40\u2005mg/day) for 12\u2005weeks and underwent echocardiography including ultrasonic tissue characterization by cyclic variation of integrated backscatter (CVIBS). Serum galectin-3 and fibrosis markers including aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), matrix metalloproteinase-2, metalloproteinase-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) were also analyzed. After 12\u2005weeks of atorvastatin (40\u2005mg/day) treatment, serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased significantly (204\u00b131 to 140\u00b124\u2005mg/dL and 133\u00b126 to 69\u00b117\u2005ng/mL, respectively, both p<0.001). In myocardial fibrosis analysis, CVIBS increased significantly (6.6\u00b11.9 to 8.5\u00b12.7\u2005dB, p=0.024). In addition, the circulating fibrosis markers serum PIIINP and TIMP-1 decreased significantly (9.5\u00b12.7 to 6.4\u00b11.4\u2005ng/mL, p=0.012 and 299\u00b165 to 250\u00b145\u2005ng/mL, p=0.024, respectively). 12\u2005weeks of medium dose atorvastatin treatment resulted in a significant reduction in myocardial fibrosis as evaluated by morphofunctional parameters and plasma markers of tissue fibrosis.",
