Obese individuals may have higher levels of serum transaminases than their lean counterparts. The main purpose of this study was to examine the effects of statins and fibrates on liver enzymes in obese patients and to compare them with their effects on patients with various body mass indexes (BMI). Two hundred and sixty-three hyperlipidemic patients of both sexes aged 31-74 years were studied for 24 weeks. One hundred and three patients received fluvastatin (40 mg/day), 62 atorvastatin (10-20 mg/day), 45 micronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day), 44 ciprofibrate (100 mg/day) and nine patients received gemfibrozil (900 mg/day). Laboratory determinations were performed at baseline, after 8 weeks of treatment and at the end of the follow-up period. At baseline, obese patients tended to exhibit elevated liver enzymes more frequently than their lean counterparts (12 of 105 vs. 5 of 67). At the end of the study period, 11 obese, seven overweight and six lean subjects exhibited elevated liver enzymes. Twelve patients who experienced a moderate elevation of serum liver enzymes at baseline had their liver enzyme profile normalized at the end of the study. Furthermore, in 12 patients who had normal serum liver enzyme levels at baseline, abnormal levels of at least one enzyme were observed after 24 weeks of treatment. Fibrates and statins are safe drugs for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in obese patients as well as in those with moderately increased liver enzymes.", 
    "1": "We previously reported that treatment of rats with a diet containing 0.1% pravastatin and 5% cholestyramine markedly increased mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MPD) activity in liver crude extracts compared with nontreated rats. In this study, we examined the change in the protein level of MPD in the tissues of mice administered pravastatin. When MPD content in the tissues of nontreated mice was analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting, a single protein band with an apparent molecular weight of 46 kDa was detected in all tissues and the specific protein content of MPD in liver and kidney was markedly higher than that in other tissues. When MPD content in the tissues of pravastatin-treated mice was analyzed by immunoblotting, MPD was markedly increased (9-fold) only in the liver compared with nontreated mice. Next, when MPD activity was measured in the liver between nontreated and pravastatin-treated mice, MPD activity as well as protein levels were markedly increased (11-fold) in the liver of pravastatin-treated mice compared with nontreated mice. These data suggest that a marked induction of MPD in the liver by pravastatin is responsible for the tissue-specific effect of pravastatin.",

Levels of fibrinogen, VWF, tissue-type plasminogen activator and FVIIa were not influenced by atorvastatin.

    "17": "Midazolam is a commonly used anaesthetic agent and is metabolised by the 3A4 isoform of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Atorvastatin is also metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 and, in vitro, atorvastatin inhibits the cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated metabolism of mexazolam. We hypothesised that concurrent administration of atorvastatin and midazolam would result in altered midazolam pharmacokinetics. Fourteen patients scheduled to undergo general anaesthesia for elective surgery were recruited in a matched pair design to receive intravenous midazolam (0.15 mg.kg-1). Of these patients, seven were taking long-term atorvastatin. Atorvastatin patients demonstrated a greater area under the curve (889.4 (standard deviation 388.6) ng-h.ml-1) vs. control patients (629.1 (standard deviation 197.2) ng-h.ml-1) (p < 0.05). Patients taking atorvastatin also demonstrated a decreased clearance (0.18 (standard deviation 0.08) l-kg. h-1) vs. control patients (0.27 (standard deviation 0.08) l-kg.h-1) (p < 0.05). This study suggests that chronically administered atorvastatin decreases the clearance of intravenously administered midazolam.", 
    "18": "Foods with plant stanol or sterol esters lower serum cholesterol levels. We summarize the deliberations of 32 experts on the efficacy and safety of sterols and stanols. A meta-analysis of 41 trials showed that intake of 2 g/d of stanols or sterols reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by 10%; higher intakes added little. Efficacy is similar for sterols and stanols, but the food form may substantially affect LDL reduction. Effects are additive with diet or drug interventions: eating foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in stanols or sterols can reduce LDL by 20%; adding sterols or stanols to statin medication is more effective than doubling the statin dose. A meta-analysis of 10 to 15 trials per vitamin showed that plasma levels of vitamins A and D are not affected by stanols or sterols. Alpha carotene, lycopene, and vitamin E levels remained stable relative to their carrier molecule, LDL. Beta carotene levels declined, but adverse health outcomes were not expected. Sterol-enriched foods increased plasma sterol levels, and workshop participants discussed whether this would increase risk, in view of the marked increase of atherosclerosis in patients with homozygous phytosterolemia. This risk is believed to be largely hypothetical, and any increase due to the small increase in plasma plant sterols may be more than offset by the decrease in plasma LDL. There are insufficient data to suggest that plant stanols or sterols either prevent or promote colon carcinogenesis. Safety of sterols and stanols is being monitored by follow-up of samples from the general population; however, the power of such studies to pick up infrequent increases in common diseases, if any exist, is limited. A trial with clinical outcomes probably would not answer remaining questions about infrequent adverse effects. Trials with surrogate end points such as intima-media thickness might corroborate the expected efficacy in reducing atherosclerosis. However, present evidence is sufficient to promote use of sterols and stanols for lowering LDL cholesterol levels in persons at increased risk for coronary heart disease.",

    "20": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia is a frequent, inherited, monogenic disorder, associated with accelerated development of atherosclerotic disease leading to coronary artery disease. Life expectancy of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia is reduced by 15-30 years unless they are adequately treated with lipid-lowering therapy. Given the chronic nature of this disease, the selection of a therapeutic approach should be strongly based on its long-term safety and tolerability. The introduction of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of familial hypercholesterolaemia. Simvastatin 40-80 mg/day effectively reduces serum low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels. Furthermore, simvastatin reduces triglycerides and mildly raises high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. In addition to the hypolipidaemic effect, other potentially important effects, such as improvement of endothelial function and reduction of LDL oxidation and vascular inflammation, have been associated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy. Simvastatin has also been shown to abolish the progression, and even facilitate the regression, of existing human atherosclerotic lesions. The good safety and tolerability profile of simvastatin is clearly highlighted by the low rate of therapy discontinuation observed in several population-based clinical trials. The most common adverse events leading to the discontinuation of therapy are gastrointestinal upset and headache. Asymptomatic elevations in liver transaminase levels and myopathy are uncommon. The overwhelming clinical evidence regarding the long-term use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia together with the long-term safety data (particularly relating to simvastatin) provide support for the use of this drug as a first-line agent when pharmacological treatment is indicated. Early intervention with simvastatin treatment can be successfully implemented with favourable economic benefits.", 
    "21": "The efficacy of pravastatin and simvastatin was first shown several years ago in patients with coronary heart disease. Other trials have since been published. In the HPS trial, which studied patients with coronary heart disease, other cardiovascular conditions, or diabetes, simvastatin significantly reduced the risk of death, coronary events and stroke when compared with placebo. In the ALLHAT-LLT trial, in patients with treated hypertension, pravastatin did not reduce overall mortality. In the PROSPER trial, in patients aged over 70 with cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors, pravastatin reduced the incidence of coronary events relative to placebo, but did not reduce overall mortality. Pharmacovigilance studies suggest there is no difference between these four statins in terms of their potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. Taken together, these trials show that statin use can be extended to patients with levels of LDL-cholesterol over 2.4 mmol/l (0.9 g/l) if they have coronary heart disease (and no hypercholesterolaemia), a history of ischaemic stroke, or lower-limb arterial disease. Statins can also be prescribed for diabetic patients with no signs of cardiovascular disease but whose LDL-cholesterol exceeds 3.4 mmol/l (1.3 g/l). Clinical trial data support the use of pravastatin or simvastatin in these situations, at a dose of 20 or 40 mg daily. Plasma creatine phosphokinase assay should be done if muscle symptoms occur or if the patient has a particular risk of rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "22": "Sepsis and septic shock are complex inflammatory syndromes. Multiple cellular activation processes are involved, and many humoral cascades are triggered. Statins have anti-inflammatory properties. Our preliminary observations indicate that patients receiving therapy with statins may have a lower incidence of severe sepsis. We hypothesize that statins have a strong protective effect against sepsis by virtue of diverse anti-inflammatory effects that are independent of their lipid-lowering ability.", 
    "23": "Hypocholesterolemic drugs may themselves increase (cholestyramine, CS) or decrease (lovastatin, Lov) peripheral tissue de novo cholesterol biosynthesis. This will alter the abundance of prenyl groups and potentially increase (CS) or decrease (Lov) K-ras membrane localization, with possible pro- or anti-carcinogenic effects (K-ras is a proto-oncogene frequently mutated in lung cancer). Female A/J, Swiss, and C57BL/6 mice were fed 2 or 4% CS, 1% niacin, or injected with Lov three (Lov-3x) or five (Lov-5x) times per week. After three weeks, serum cholesterol and triglycerides were determined enzymatically. Total, membrane, and cytoplasmic K-ras proteins were determined in lung homogenates by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting with a K-ras specific antibody. CS feeding increased membrane K-ras as hypothesized in A/J and C57BL/6 mice, but had no effect in Swiss mice. Lov failed in all three strains to reduce membrane K-ras, and resulted in an increase in total K-ras in A/J and C57BL/6 mice, while again lacking effect in Swiss mice. Niacin had no effect on K-ras protein in any mouse strain. These results differ from our published results for male mice of the same strains, particularly for A/J mice. Increased amounts of K-ras protein in the membrane fraction of A/J females (but not males) treated with either Lov or CS imply that if K-ras were to become mutated, CS could result in increased lung tumorigenesis and Lov would be less likely to be protective in females. In the light of these data, both sexes should be included in future animal and human chemoprevention trials.", 
    "24": "This study was initiated to determine whether heart transplant recipients (HTRs) with cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) have increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and to examine whether an increase in hsCRP after heart transplantation predicts the development of CAV.

    "26": "On referral for their annual angiographic control study, 150 consecutive HTRs (mean 6.5 years since transplantation) were included. Plasma levels of hsCRP were measured before angiography and compared with patients with (n = 52) and without (n = 98) CAV. In 49 of these patients, we additionally analyzed hsCRP in blood samples stored from their six-month visit after the transplantation procedure. Furthermore, in a randomized, crossover study, hsCRP was analyzed in 17 male HTRs before and after six weeks of treatment with 20 mg pravastatin.",

Prospectively evaluated hsCRP levels from six months to follow-up were significantly higher among those who developed CAV compared with those with normal angiograms [+2.76 (1.56 to 5.00) vs. +0.07 (-0.57 to 0.41) mg/l, p < 0.001]. On multivariate analysis, the increase in hsCRP was the only significant predictor of CAV. Six weeks of treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced hsCRP levels by 25%, without any relation to changes in lipid values.",

Some purification steps (liquid-liquid extraction, solid-phase extraction, etc.) have been used before they are submitted to separation by chromatographic procedures and they are detected by various detection methods like UV, fluorescence and mass spectrometry.

    "34": "Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is crucial for cholesterol biosynthesis, and are widely used as lipid-lowering agents. These drugs greatly reduce atherosclerosis and cardiovascular morbidity, which in the past was mainly attributed to their cholesterol-lowering properties. However, recent evidence suggests that statins are also potent immunomodulators. They exerted beneficial effects on animal models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and thus have therapeutic potential for multiple sclerosis. Their exact mechanism of action is still unclear. HMG-CoA-dependent effects and a direct effect on immune receptors are conceivable and are reviewed here.", 
    "35": "The optimal drug for the prevention of venous thromboembolism is one that is efficacious, associated with minimal bleeding risk, and easy to administer. Statins fulfill the latter two criteria, but their efficacy remains unproved. By examining the association between dyslipidemia and venous thromboembolism, as well as the evidence that statins might prevent venous thromboembolism, there may be a new rationale for the use of this class of drugs. There may be a common link between arterial and venous thrombosis. Dyslipidemia may be one of the many systemic factors associated not only with arterial thrombosis, but with venous thromboembolism as well. This may occur through the effects of circulating lipid molecules on the vascular endothelium, platelet function, and coagulation factors. By impeding these mechanisms, statins may be protective against venous thrombosis, but epidemiologic studies are few in number, and no randomized clinical trials have been conducted. Better epidemiologic evidence is required to establish whether dyslipidemia is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. If future observational studies can demonstrate that statins are associated with a lower risk of venous thromboembolism, then consideration should be given to conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing statins with placebo for the prevention of venous thromboembolism. Until then, the efficacy of statins for the prevention or treatment of venous thromboembolism remains uncertain.", 
    "36": "Drug-induced muscle disorders represent a broad clinical spectrum, from asymptomatic elevated serum creatine kinase levels to life-threatening myopathies. An increasing number of drugs have been suspected or identified as myotoxic. It would be unrealistic to attempt to list them. In clinical practice, an iatrogenic origin must be discussed in any patient presenting with muscle symptoms in as much as drug-induced myopathies are usually reversible after discontinuation of the offending compound. The clinical and histopathological features depend on the causative agent and individual susceptibility to a given compound. Apart from isolated myalgias, drug-induced myopathies can be divided into five major categories: necrotising myopathies mainly due to lipid-lowering drugs; inflammatory myopathies, including polymyositis (especially associated with thiol compounds) and maphrophagic myofasciitis; mitochondrial myopathies, mainly due to antiretroviral nucleoside analogues; corticosteroid myopathy; and various forms of painless neuromyopathies. In some cases (e.g., statin-induced myopathies), risk factors have been clearly identified and preventive measures have been recommended.", 
    "37": "HIV protease inhibitors decrease mortality and improve quality of life in patients with HIV infection. However, these drugs have been associated with serum lipid elevations, which may pose an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis. Treatment of protease inhibitor-related hyperlipidaemia (PIH) is complicated by drug interactions, which significantly increase concentrations of most 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins). Although pravastatin and atorvastatin effectively lower cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in HIV-infected patients, a significant number of patients did not achieve their National Cholesterol Education Program low density lipoprotein concentration goals. Nonetheless, due to the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis with elevated statin concentrations, atorvastatin should be considered a second-line agent. The limited available PIH data supports the fact that pravastatin and atorvastatin are well-tolerated in HIV-infected individuals. More data are needed on the appropriate starting doses, maximum safe doses, role of combination statin-fibrate therapy, documentation of coronary heart disease benefit and incidence of myotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Pravastatin has an acceptable risk-benefit ratio in PIH, while theoretical toxicity concerns exist with atorvastatin.", 
    "38": "In this mini-review, the evidence for safety and efficacy of currently available statins is discussed. Large-scale, long-term clinical studies have documented an outstanding efficacy and safety profile for statin monotherapy when used at pharmacological doses. Non-life-threatening side effects may occur in up to 15% of patients receiving one statin. Sporadic reports show possible adverse effects of statins on nervous system function including mood alterations. More serious side effects may also occur but at much lower rates. Significant elevations in the activity of serum aminotransferase and creatine kinase alone or in combination with muscle pain in statin-treated patients should be taken seriously; under these conditions, monitoring the statin dose or its discontinuation must be considered. Unlike monotherapy, combination therapy is more problematic. Particularly, combination of the statins with gemfibrozil results in higher rates of drug toxicity. Co-administration of statins with other drugs, especially those which may interfere with the cytochrome P450 system, should be considered carefully. Special attention must be paid to the tolerability of the statins in elderly and transplant patients. The safety of statins in children and adolescents has not yet been well-documented, thus, statin therapy is not routinely recommended in this group of hyperlipidaemic subjects. Future clinical studies and surveillance information will warrant long-term safety of each member of this class of lipid-lowering agents.", 
    "39": "The noted myotoxicity and subsequent withdrawal of cerivastatin from the worldwide market in August 2001 has demonstrated that the safety of statins is not a class effect. The total rhabdomyolysis rate for cerivastatin was 16 - 80 times more frequent than with other statins without providing additional efficacy. Cerivastatin has a pharmacokinetic profile (high potency, bioavailability, lipophilicity and renal excretion) that is different from other statins, which may explain the high myotoxicity rate. The cerivastatin experience has also provided insights into high-risk populations (i.e., the elderly, women, those with renal impairment, co-administration of interacting drugs) that are more prone to statin-induced myopathy. Ultimately, the lessons learned from this experience may significantly improve the safety of statin use in the future.", 
    "40": "Combination lipid-altering regimens represent an emerging clinical paradigm to meet increasingly stringent consensus lipoprotein targets for coronary prevention. This practice, together with escalating prevalences of coronary artery disease in certain ageing (western industrial) populations, polypharmacy in the elderly and the recent voluntary market withdrawal of cerivastatin, warrants a re-examination of the safety profiles of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (i.e., statins). These agents are exceedingly well-tolerated in the vast majority of patients, very infrequently precipitating musculoskeletal symptoms and/or signs. Statins vary in their pharmacological profiles, leading to distinct levels of systemic exposure and capacities to penetrate skeletal myocytes. Pharmacokinetic interactions with certain agents increase the likelihood of statin-induced myopathy and, in exceedingly rare instances, potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and renal failure. As with other medical decisions, the anticipated benefits of long-term statin therapy, with or without other lipid-altering agents, need to be weighed against the prospects of clinically significant drug interactions. In clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance, the two statins that are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A4 system (fluvastatin and pravastatin) have exhibited very low propensities to elicit myopathy when combined with other agents. These agents should be considered initially when contemplating combination lipid-lowering regimens for coronary prevention.",

    "42": "Fifty-six rabbits were randomly divided into eight groups (n = 7, each). Fluvastatin was given mixed with food at daily dose of 8 mg/kg starting 5 days before catheterization. Light microscope, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscope and RT-PCR assay were applied to assess vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and apoptosis, as well as oncogene expression in vascular wall.", 
    "43": "At day 10 and day 15 after catheter induced denudation intima/media (I/M) thickness ratio was obviously higher, and also the percentage of PCNA-positive cells and TUNEL-positive cells in media was significantly higher compared with controls. The intimal hyperplasia was mostly composed of alpha-SM-actin-positive cells. In rabbits given fluvastatin I/M ratio and the percentage of these positive cells significantly decreased compared with those without fluvastatin. The overexpression of proto-oncogene H-ras mRNA and decreased expression of anti-oncogene p53 mRNA were found after vascular injury, whereas fluvastatin significantly reduced H-ras mRNA and increased p53 mRNA expression.", 
    "44": "Proliferation of VSMC in the media and the migration to the intima can be inhibited, and apoptosis of VSMC be induced by short-term use of fluvastatin after balloon catheter denudation, independent of serum lipid change. The underlying mechanism is presumably associated with the influence of fluvastatin on oncogene expression in the injured vascular wall.", 
    "45": "Squalene synthase (E.C. 2.5.1.21) is a microsomal enzyme which catalyzes the reductive dimerization of two molecules of farnesyl diphosphate to form squalene, and is involved in the first committed step in cholesterol biosynthesis. It is an attractive target for hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic strategies. We synthesized a series of 3-ethylidenequinuclidine derivatives, and evaluated their ability to inhibit squalene synthase in vitro and to lower non-HDL cholesterol levels in hamsters. 3-Ethylidenequinuclidine derivatives incorporating an unsubstituted 9H-carbazole moiety reduced plasma non-HDL cholesterol levels and did not affect plasma transaminase levels, indicating a lack of hepatotoxicity. Among the novel compounds, (Z)-2-[2-(quinuclidin-3-ylidene)ethoxy]-9H-carbazole hydrochloride 8 (YM-53579) and (E)-2-[2-fluoro-2-(quinuclidin-3-ylidene)ethoxy]-9H-carbazole hydrochloride 28 (YM-53601) were potent inhibitors of squalene synthase derived from human hepatoma cells, with IC(50) values of 160 and 79 nM, respectively.

Cardiovascular risk is independently predicted not only by high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), but also low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated triglycerides. Moreover, we now understand that LDL particle size and number are associated with differing levels of atherogenicity. Metabolic syndrome, increasingly being recognized as a marker for elevated cardiovascular risk, is associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by low HDL-C, high triglycerides, and small, dense LDL particles. Controlled clinical studies have shown that niacin therapy effectively increases HDL-C and lowers triglyceride and LDL-C levels while causing a shift toward larger, less atherogenic LDL particles. Niacin, alone or in combination, prevents progression and promotes regression of coronary atherogenic lesions and significantly reduces CHD-related morbidity and mortality. Statin monotherapy causes modest increases in HDL-C and decreases triglycerides, while more potently reducing LDL-C. Combinations of lipid-modifying agents may better address the full spectrum of lipoprotein abnormalities in some patients. Investigations have shown that combining statin therapy with niacin results in additive improvement in the major lipids and lipoproteins and improves clinical outcome. With recently broadened treatment recommendations, it seems likely that combination therapy will be increasingly deemed the appropriate choice for addressing a range of lipid abnormalities.", 
    "55": "Impaired NO-dependent vasodilation of resistance vessels is an early marker of an increased risk of atherosclerosis; utility of the examination of microcirculation, however, is far less established. We have therefore tested the hypothesis that hypercholesterolemia is associated with an impaired microvascular reactivity and that this defect is at least partially reversible by lipid-lowering treatment. Twenty-seven otherwise healthy patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (HLP) were examined at rest and then after 10 weeks of atorvastatin treatment (20 mg/day). Skin microvascular reactivity (MVR) was examined by laser-Doppler flowmetry. Baseline MVR values of the studied group were compared to healthy control subjects, HLP patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetic patients with and without diabetic retinopathy. MVR was normal in HLP subjects without CAD. On the contrary, MVR was impaired in HLP patients with CAD. There was no effect of atorvastatin on MVR, despite the profound reduction of serum lipids. MVR values did not correlate with cholesterol levels. In diabetic subjects, the MVR was substantially impaired only in patients with retinopathy. In the subjects without retinopathy, MVR was either normal (type I diabetes) or moderately impaired (type II diabetes). MVR was thus normal in HLP patients without manifest vascular disease and was not influenced by lipid lowering therapy. Impairment in the MVR was only evident in subjects with HLP and severe CAD. These results suggest that microcirculation is not involved in the early vascular dysfunction induced by HLP and that MVR rather reflects changes which appear later in the course of the atherosclerotic disease.",

Statins differ in many aspects e.g. intensity of side-effects. It is possible that some hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) therapy is associated with cataract occurrence. The purpose of these studies was to focus on the potential cataractogenic contribution of atorvastatin. The studies were carried out on white Wistar rats. The animals were given atorvastatin (Sortis--Parke-Davis, USA) in two doses: 1.14 mg/kg mg/day, and 11.4 mg/day. Lens structure was observed in stereoscopic, dark-filed and in optic microscope, the cataract was observed in the examined preparations, specially high doses administered. We concluded that lens turned out to be reacting to atorvastatin. Drug dose corresponded to increase in the number and duration of cataract episodes (changes were more significant in the experimental groups 11.4 mg/kg). Alterations in the examined lens design may be a result of atorvastatin effect.",

    "62": "3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, are competitive inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Several clinical trials have shown a marked reduction in cholesterol levels associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality in patients treated with statins. However, more recent observations have suggested that the clinical benefits of statins may be, at least in part, independent of the effect of statins on cholesterol synthesis. These so-called pleiotropic or cholesterol-independent effects of statins could be the result of reduction in the formation of intermediaries in the mevalonate pathway as statins, by inhibiting L-mevalonic acid synthesis, also prevent the production of isoprenoids in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Isoprenoids serve as important lipid attachments for the posttranslational modification of a variety of proteins such as small GTP-binding proteins of the Ras superfamily implicated in intracellular signaling. The list of different pleitropic effects of statins is still growing and includes, among others, direct effects of statins on modulating endothelial function, decreasing oxidative stress and, more recently, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions of statins. For instance, statins decrease T cell activation, the recruitment of inflammatory cells into atherosclerotic lesions, and inhibit IFN-gamma expression of MHC II on antigen-presenting cells. This review article summarizes the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of statins and thus provides a new rationale to use statins as a new class of immunosuppressive agents.",

To elucidate any potential species differences, the in vitro metabolism of pitavastatin and its lactone was studied with hepatic and renal microsomes from rats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys and humans. 2. With the addition of UDP-glucuronic acid to hepatic microsomes, pitavastatin lactone was identified as the main metabolite in several animals, including humans. 3. Metabolic clearances of pitavastatin and its lactone in monkey hepatic microsome were much greater than in humans. 4. M4, a metabolite of pitavastatin with a 3-dehydroxy structure, was converted to its lactone form in monkey hepatic microsomes in the presence of UDP-glucuronic acid as well as to pitavastatin. These results implied that lactonization is a common pathway for drugs such as 5-hydroxy pentanoic acid derivatives. 5. The acid forms were metabolized to their lactone forms because of their structural characteristics. 6.

In the guidelines, HDL-C is important in risk stratification in primary prevention, influencing the need for and intensity of treatment of LDL-C, and both HDL-C and triglyceride are defined as risk factors for the metabolic syndrome, a secondary target of therapy. Triglyceride level also determines in which individuals non-HDL-C should be a secondary target of therapy. Risk assessment that takes into account the entire lipid profile will identify more high-risk individuals than evaluating LDL-C alone. Some epidemiologic data suggest that instead of measuring the cholesterol in LDL or HDL, measuring their respective apolipoproteins, apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 and apo A-I, may improve CHD risk assessment, and in some observational and interventional studies, ratios of lipids and/or apolipoproteins have been better predictors of CHD risk than levels of any one lipid fraction. Trials of lipid-modifying therapy also suggest that apolipoproteins and ratios may provide improved targets for therapy beyond LDL-C, but optimal values have not been established. Because lipid-modifying therapy affects multiple components of the lipid profile, the effect on all lipid parameters should be considered when selecting the most appropriate agent. Therapies with beneficial effects across the lipid profile would be expected to improve CHD risk reduction.",

Likewise, the metabolic syndrome is a secondary target of treatment. Drug therapy usually starts with an LDL-C-lowering agent, such as a statin.

With the aging of the US population and trends toward increasing obesity, diabetes, and impaired fasting glucose, primary care physicians are likely to be faced with growing numbers of patients at risk for CHD.

The study of factors related to the inhibition indicated IL-6 is important. Indeed, rhIL-6 abolished pravastatin-induced growth inhibition in KMS-21BM cells which did not express IL-6. Statins may be useful in maintenance therapy for myeloma after the screening of IL-6 status.", 
    "113": "The efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering agents in elderly individuals have not been extensively assessed. This population generally takes more drugs concurrently than middle-aged patients, and are therefore at higher risk of drug-drug interactions. This large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the efficacy and safety of extended-release (XL) fluvastatin 80 mg once daily for up to 1 year in elderly patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. A total of 1229 patients (mean age, 75.5 years) were randomized. After 2 months of treatment, fluvastatin XL 80 mg significantly decreased plasma lipid levels from baseline compared with placebo; fluvastatin reduced total cholesterol by 25% compared with a decrease of 2.5% in the placebo group, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was -33% vs. -2.5%, respectively, and triglycerides were -13.3% vs. 2.9%, respectively (p<0.00001). The safety profile of fluvastatin XL was similar to that of placebo. Fluvastatin XL 80 mg once daily was well tolerated and effectively managed plasma lipid profiles in a large cohort of elderly patients. These findings are consistent with data obtained previously in younger recipients of fluvastatin XL 80 mg, and reinforce the safety of fluvastatin in a population at high risk of drug-drug interactions.", 
    "114": "This randomized open-label trial investigated whether autonomic cardiovascular control is altered in middle-aged men with combined hyperlipidemia and whether such alterations are affected by short-term, lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin and/or fenofibrate. Compared with normolipidemic subjects, untreated subjects with combined hyperlipidemia had several abnormalities of autonomic tone, indicating increased sympathetic tone and decreased baroreflex sensitivity. The alterations in autonomic cardiovascular control were partially reversible by each of the lipid-lowering drugs.", 
    "115": "The comparative effects of more versus less aggressive low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering (to </=80 vs >80 mg/dl) on calcified coronary plaque progression by electron beam tomography were evaluated in 182 consecutive asymptomatic patients after 1.2 years of treatment with statins alone or in combination with niacin. Despite the greater improvement in lipids in the </=80 versus >80 mg/dl groups, there were no differences in calcified plaque progression (9.3%/year vs 9.1%/year). We conclude that, with respect to LDL cholesterol lowering, \"lower is better\" is not supported by changes in calcified plaque progression.", 
    "116": "This report provides preliminary evidence that statins may lower C-reactive protein levels by interfering with the generation and/or release of C-reactive protein in the liver rather than by modulating inflammatory processes in the vessel wall.", 
    "117": "In this randomized trial, C-reactive protein increased during the first 5 days of an acute coronary syndrome in patients treated with placebo, but this phenomenon was not observed in those randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg/day. This suggests that short-term statin therapy inhibits inflammation in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "118": "In clinical practice, we found no significant difference between atorvastatin therapy or other statin therapies in the clinical outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes receiving clopidogrel therapy. In patients receiving atorvastatin therapy, clopidogrel therapy was associated with a significant decrease in mortality and stroke during univariate analysis and a moderate trend of reduced mortality and stroke without statistical significance in the multivariate analysis.", 
    "119": "Chronic heart failure is associated with inflammation and neurohormonal imbalance. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, exert anti-inflammatory and vascular protective effects. We hypothesized that short-term statin therapy may have beneficial effects in patients with nonischemic heart failure.", 
    "120": "Sixty-three patients with symptomatic, nonischemic, dilated cardiomyopathy were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group received simvastatin (n=24), and the other group received placebo (n=27). The initial dose of simvastatin was 5 mg/d, which was increased to 10 mg/d after 4 weeks. After 14 weeks, patients receiving simvastatin exhibited a modest reduction in serum cholesterol level compared with patients receiving placebo (130+/-13 versus 148+/-18, P<0.05). Patients treated with simvastatin had a lower New York Heart Association functional class compared with patients receiving placebo (2.04+/-0.06 versus 2.32+/-0.05, P<0.01). This corresponded to improved left ventricular ejection fraction in the simvastatin group (34+/-3 to 41+/-4%, P<0.05) but not in the placebo group. Furthermore, plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and brain natriuretic peptide were significantly lower in the simvastatin group compared with the placebo group.", 
    "121": "Short-term statin therapy improves cardiac function, neurohormonal imbalance, and symptoms associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. These findings suggest that statins may have therapeutic benefits in patients with heart failure irrespective of serum cholesterol levels or atherosclerotic heart disease.", 
    "122": "A recent clinical study showed that statins, which are inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, reduced the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Animal studies that have employed high cholesterol diet indicate significant relationship between cholesterol level and senile plaque deposition. Here, we investigated the effects of lovastatin on beta-amyloid production and senile plaque deposition in an animal model of AD (Tg2576 mice). As expected, lovastatin treatment reduced plasma cholesterol level in both male and female mice. However, lovastatin enhanced the amounts of beta-amyloid and other beta-secretase derived peptides in females, but not in males. Likewise, lovastatin increased the number of plaques in the hippocampus and cortex of females, but not in males. Lovastatin did not change the amounts of full-length or alpha-secretase processed amyloid precursor protein (APP), or presenilin 1 (PS1) in either sex. Thus, lovastatin lowers cholesterol level in both genders, but enhances beta-amyloid production and senile plaque deposition only in brains of female Tg2576 mice. Our results suggest that low plasma cholesterol levels might be a risk factor for AD in females.",

    "124": "We searched the MedWatch drug surveillance system of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from November 1997-February 2002 for reports of statin-associated memory loss. We also reviewed the published literature (using MEDLINE) and prescribing information for these drugs.", 
    "125": "Of the 60 patients identified who had memory loss associated with statins, 36 received simvastatin, 23 atorvastatin, and 1 pravastatin. About 50% of the patients noted cognitive adverse effects within 2 months of therapy. Fourteen (56%) of 25 patients noted improvement when the statin was discontinued. Memory loss recurred in four patients who were rechallenged with the drug. None of the 60 reported cognitive test results. Two placebo-controlled trials found no benefits for statins on cognition or disability. One randomized controlled trial of simvastatin found no effects on cerebrospinal amyloid levels. In one small, randomized study, patients receiving statins showed a trend toward lower cognitive performance than those receiving placebo. Five observational studies found a lower risk of dementia among patients receiving statins.", 
    "126": "Current literature is conflicting with regard to the effects of statins on memory loss. Experimental studies support links between cholesterol intake and amyloid synthesis; observational studies indicate that patients receiving statins have a reduced risk of dementia. However, available prospective studies show no cognitive or antiamyloid benefits for any statin. In addition, case reports raise the possibility that statins, in rare cases, may be associated with cognitive impairment, though causality is not certain.", 
    "127": "The Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III) provides an evidence-based approach to the diagnosis of dyslipidemia and the management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). This article provides a brief overview of the ATP III therapeutic approach (therapeutic lifestyle changes alone or in combination with a pharmacologic agent) in which the patient's level of risk for coronary heart disease guides the intensity of intervention to lower LDL-C concentrations. Because statins have been found to effectively help patients reach ATP III target LDL-C levels to reduce their risk of coronary events, they tend to be the treatment of choice when initial therapy with therapeutic lifestyle changes alone fails to achieve the target level. Discussion includes a summary of the beneficial properties of statins beyond lipid lowering.", 
    "128": "This review of lipid-lowering trials looks at both the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. It also introduces evidence pointing toward the emerging importance of nonlipid risk factors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This review is designed to enhance the primary care physician's working knowledge of the evidence supporting the importance of LDL-C reduction and the central role of statin therapy in the reduction of the risk of coronary heart disease, as well as provide a greater understanding of emerging risk factors.", 
    "129": "The guideline for hyperlipidemia was first discussed at the meeting of the Japan Atherosclerosis Society in 1987 and further discussed and published for the first time by the Society in 1997. Thereafter, a new guideline \"Japan Atherosclerosis Society(JAS) Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases\" was released in September 2002 taking the results of J-LIT study and others into consideration. The diagnostic values of TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG for hyperlipidemia are > or = 220 mg/dl, > or = 140 mg/dl, < 40 mg/dl, and > or = 150 mg/dl, respectively, the same figures as those of a previous guideline in 1997. Other criteria were made as management goals for patients with coronary heart disease in each category, classified by the number of risk factors. According to the criteria, the recommended level of TC is < 240 mg/dl in males aged less than 45 with no risk factors. If any result is abnormal, treatment by life style and dietary modification should be started first and drug therapy should be a second choice. It should be noted that this guideline helps to inform, not replace, the physician's clinical judgement, which must ultimately determine the appropriate treatment for each individual.", 
    "130": "This review describes the role of statins in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and the clinical benefit of therapy with statins in different forms of coronary artery disease (stable, unstable and myocardial infarction). Presented clinical trials have provided data that statins not only reduce plasma total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels but also reduce major coronary event rate and all-cause mortality. Treatment with statins is usually well tolerated. The mean total cost of care to reach LDL-cholesterol target is significantly lower with atorvastatin than with the other statins.", 
    "131": "Anecdotal evidence indicates that significant lowering of LDL-cholesterol by means of LDL apheresis may reduce the level of microalbuminuria in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. We therefore examined whether treatment with the most potent LDL-lowering drug available (atorvastatin) has a similar effect on the level of microalbuminuria.", 
    "132": "In a case series, 100 patients with familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia were started on 10 mg atorvastatin. 62 patients were switched to 40 mg atorvastatin once in the evening when the LDL-cholesterol treatment goals were not reached within 1 month.", 
    "133": "Baseline serum creatinine clearance significantly improved after 1, 3 and 6 months, while serum urea and serum creatinine were unchanged. Blood pressure exhibited a lowering trend. After one month of treatment, the mean level of microalbuminuria was significantly improved in both dose regimens, showing further improvement after 3 months and stabilizing thereafter.", 
    "134": "These data indicate that significant lowering of LDL-cholesterol with atorvastatin may favorably affect kidney function, in particular microalbuminuria as a measure of endothelial function. It remains to be seen whether this effect can be attributed to lipid lowering alone.", 
    "135": "The authors investigated the effect of atorvastatin (40 mg qd) on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle distribution in patients with dyslipidemias of type IIA (n = 55) and IIB (n = 21). Atorvastatin therapy induced a significant decrease in total and LDL cholesterol in both patient groups. A significant reduction in triglyceride values, which was more profound in type IIB patients, was also observed. In type IIA patients, LDL-3 was the predominant subfraction. Atorvastatin therapy induced a significant reduction in total LDL mass in this group of patients that was mainly due to the reduction in large and intermediate subspecies (LDL-1 to LDL-3), whereas the mass of dense LDL particles (LDL-4 and LDL-5) remained unchanged. As a consequence, the percentage contribution of dense subfractions to the total LDL mass increased significantly after atorvastatin therapy. The dense LDL-4 subfraction was the predominant one in type IIB patients. In this group, atorvastatin therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the total LDL mass, which was due to the reduction in all LDL subfractions. Thus, the percentage mass distribution of LDL particles remained unaffected. These results suggest that the effect of atorvastatin on LDL subfractions is affected by the underlying genetic defect.", 
    "136": "Apolipoprotein (apo) E and C-I are plasma apolipoproteins that have been implicated in the etiology of atherosclerosis and obesity, respectively. Both proteins are synthesized and secreted by macrophages, though pharmacological regulation of their production is poorly understood. The authors compared the effect of 2 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, atorvastatin and cerivastatin, on the synthesis and secretion of apoE and apoC-I by THP-1 macrophages. Atorvastatin reduced medium apoE and cellular apoE mRNA of PMA-activated THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (-24% and -22%, respectively, at 1-micromol/L, P < 0.01). ApoC-I in the medium was also reduced by atorvastatin in a dose-dependent manner, though to a lesser extent (-15% at 1-micromol/L, P < 0.05). Cerivastatin similarly reduced medium apoE (-20% at 1-micromol/L, P < 0.05) and cellular apoE mRNA (-31% at 1-micromol/L, P < 0.05), and significantly lowered cellular apoC-I mRNA (-15%, P < 0.05), but not apoC-I in the medium. In experiments with THP-1 macrophages loaded with cholesterol (ie, 24-hour incubation with acetyl-LDL), atorvastatin and cerivastatin (1-micromol/L) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced both medium apoE (-30% and -25%, respectively) and cellular apoE mRNA (-25% and -17%, respectively). A lower and less consistent effect was observed on medium apoC-I (-6% and -18%, respectively) and cellular apoC-I mRNA (-13% and -19%, respectively). These data demonstrate that statins have the capacity to reduce the synthesis and secretion of both apoE and apoC-I in THP-1 macrophages loaded or unloaded with cholesterol.", 
    "137": "Blood pressure, plasma NO(2) and NO(3) level, heart weight index, antioxidant enzyme activity, and vascular reactivity in rat intact aortic rings were assessed to investigate the effects of 8-week treatment with the hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin (1 mg/kg per day) on endothelial dysfunction induced by chronic Nomega-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME 70 mg/kg per day). Results were compared with those obtained in rats receiving l-NAME, simvastatin or control animals. Coadministration of simvastatin did not restore l-NAME-increased blood pressure but normalized heart weight index (P < 0.05), endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (P < 0.001), and plasma NO(2) and NO(3) concentration (P < 0.001) without affecting relaxation to sodium nitroprusside. Endothelium-dependent relaxation in these animals was abolished by acute incubation with l-NAME, unaffected by thromboxane synthetase inhibitor and TXA(2)/PGH(2) receptor antagonist, ridogrel, and decreased by indomethacin. Simvastatin treatment also increased plasma NO(2)+NO(3) without affecting endothelial function, heart weight index, and blood pressure of control rats. The presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase improved endothelial relaxation only in l-NAME-treated rats, but O(2)- generated by hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase inhibited the relaxant effect in both l-NAME and simvastatin plus l-NAME-treated rats. SOD activity was increased in all groups receiving simvastatin. Long-term treatment with simvastatin restored l-NAME-induced endothelial dysfunction, probably by preventing nitric oxide decrease. Other effects of simvastatin, including release of compensating vasodilatory cyclo-oxygenase products and increased SOD activity, could also be involved.",

To meet this, the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease (DoH, 2000) set out a plan to ensure agreed standards of care are available to everyone. One focus is to prevent illness through secondary prevention.", 
    "139": "Increased serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentrations are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Xuezhikang, an extract of cholestin, effectively lowers fasting cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. We studied whether xuezhikang lowered Lp(a) and hsCRP concentrations.", 
    "140": "We randomly divided 60 CHD patients into two groups to receive xuezhikang (1200 mg daily) or placebo for 6 weeks. The fasting hsCRP concentration and the postprandial changes of serum lipid concentrations at 2, 4, and 6 h after a high-fat meal (800 calories; 50 g of fat) were measured before and after the 6-week protocol.", 
    "141": "The two groups had similar baseline fasting lipid and hsCRP concentrations. The postprandial triglyceride and Lp(a) concentrations were significantly increased (P <0.05). After 6 weeks, the fasting and postprandial lipid concentrations decreased significantly in the xuezhikang group, accompanied by a significant reduction in fasting hsCRP concentration (P <0.001). The placebo group had no significant change in lipid concentrations, whereas the fasting serum hsCRP concentration was reduced significantly (P <0.05). The reduction in hsCRP was closely related to the changes in fasting Lp(a) concentration (r = 0.402; P <0.05) and triglyceride area under the curve (r = 0.441; P <0.001).",

    "143": "The study assessed the biochemical differences between right hemispheric dominant and left hemispheric dominant individuals. The HMG CoA reductase activity, isoprenoid metabolites--serum digoxin--serum magnesium, and RBC membrane Na+-K+ ATPase activity were also studied. The results showed that right hemispheric chemically dominant individuals had increased (i) HMG CoA reductase activity, elevated digoxin levels, (ii) reduced RBC membrane Na+-K+ ATPase activity and serum magnesium levels. Left hemispheric chemically dominant individuals had the opposite patterns. Right hemispheric chemical dominance represents a hyperdigoxinemic/hypomagnesemic state with membrane sodium-potassium ATPase inhibition. Left hemispheric chemical dominance represents the reverse pattern with hypodigoxinemia/hypermagnesemia and membrane sodium-potassium ATPase stimulation. Cerebral chemical dominance can regulate calcium/magnesium metabolism.", 
    "144": "The study assessed the biochemical differences between right hemispheric dominant and left hemispheric dominant individuals detected by handedness and the dichotic listening test. The isoprenoid metabolites--digoxin, dolichol, and ubiquinone, glycoconjugate metabolism, free radical metabolism, and the RBC membrane composition were studied in individuals with differing hemispheric dominance. The results showed that all right hemispheric dominant individuals and 50% of left hemispheric dominant individuals had increased HMG CoA reductase activity, elevated digoxin and dolichol levels. The serum magnesium, RBC membrane Na+-K+ ATPase activity and serum ubiquinone levels were reduced in all right hemispheric dominant individuals and 50% of left hemispheric dominant individuals. The tryptophan-derived neurotransmitters--serotonin, quinolinic acid, strychnine, and nicotine--were increased while the tyrosine derived neurotransmitters--dopamine, noradrenaline, and morphine--were reduced in all right hemispheric dominant individuals and 50% of left hemispheric dominant individuals. The other 50% of left hemispheric dominant individuals had decreased HMG CoA reductase activity, reduced digoxin, and dolichol levels. The serum magnesium, RBC membrane Na+-K+ ATPase activity, and serum ubiquinone levels were increased in this group. The tryptophan derived neurotransmitters--serotonin, quinolinic acid, strychnine, and nicotine were reduced, while the tyrosine-derived neurotransmitters--dopamine, noradrenaline, and morphine-- were increased in the rest (50% of left hemispheric dominant individuals). Hemispheric dominance detected by the dichotic listening test and handedness has no correlation with cerebral chemical dominance.", 
    "145": "Vascular defects contribute substantially to neuropathic changes associated with metabolic abnormalities in diabetes. Statins appear to exert beneficial effects on vascular function independent of cholesterol lowering. In studies of the streptozotocin-induced diabetes rat model, rosuvastatin treatment was shown to correct sciatic motor and saphenous sensory nerve conduction velocity deficits (large fiber defects), thermal hyperalgesia (small fiber defects) and deficits in sciatic nerve and superior cervical ganglion blood flow. Rosuvastatin reversed deficits in nitrergic nerve-mediated vasodilation in the corpus cavernosum and corrected deficits in endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor-mediated vasodilation in mesenteric vessels. Rosuvastatin did not alter plasma cholesterol in diabetic animals (a characteristic effect in this model), but significantly lowered triglycerides at high doses. Treatment with mevalonate reversed the beneficial effects of rosuvastatin on nerve function and blood flow, suggesting that the effects are mediated by inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in the absence of cholesterol reduction. Thus, rosuvastatin has wide-ranging neurovascular actions in diabetic rats that may be independent of lipid-lowering activity.", 
    "146": "Efforts to reduce the burden of coronary heart disease (CHD) associated with type 2 diabetes should include increased emphasis on preventing progression to diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. Recent large-scale studies have shown that lifestyle intervention can reduce progression to diabetes by nearly 60%. Dyslipidaemia is a risk factor for CHD in diabetic patients. Accumulation of evidence indicating significant reductions in CHD risk with statin treatment to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol has led to the recommendation that reduction of LDL-cholesterol be considered the highest priority in treating diabetic dyslipidaemia; additional aims of treatment include raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and reducing triglyceride levels. In a recent trial of rosuvastatin alone or combined with fenofibrate in diabetic patients with combined hyperlipidaemia, rosuvastatin 40 mg monotherapy produced marked beneficial changes in LDL-cholesterol (-47%), HDL-cholesterol (+6%) and triglycerides (-30%), with the combination of lower-dose rosuvastatin (10 mg) and fenofibrate producing a significantly greater triglyceride reduction (-47%) and comparable changes in other lipid measures. Combination therapies for dyslipidaemia may be the key to optimizing CHD risk reduction in type 2 diabetes.", 
    "147": "Tamoxifen is a potent antagonist of estrogen, and hepatic steatosis is a frequent complication in adjuvant tamoxifen for breast cancer. Impaired hepatic FA beta-oxidation in peroxisomes, microsomes, and mitochondria results in progression of massive hepatic steatosis in estrogen deficiency. This impairment, although latent, is potentially serious: About 3% of the general population in the United States is now suffering from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis associated with obesity and hyperlipidemia. Therefore, in the present study we tried to restore impaired hepatic FA beta-oxidation by administering a novel statin, pitavastatin, to aromatase-deficient (Ar-/-) mice defective in intrinsic estrogen synthesis. Northern blot analysis of Ar-/- mice liver revealed a significant restoration of mRNA expression of essential enzymes involved in FA beta-oxidation such as very long fatty acyl-CoA synthetase in peroxisome, peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Severe hepatic steatosis observed in Ar-/- mice substantially regressed. Consistent findings were obtained in the in vitro assays of FA beta-oxidation activity. These findings demonstrate that pitavastatin is capable of restoring impaired FA beta-oxidation in vivo via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha-mediated signaling pathway and is potent enough to ameliorate severe hepatic steatosis in mice deficient in intrinsic estrogen.", 
    "148": "Dyslipidemic conditions and their cardiovascular related complications are common. Effective primary and secondary prevention strategies include therapies to lower LDL and total cholesterol and to increase HDL. Further, it seems that there is a need for therapeutic reduction in triglycerides as it emerges as an independent risk factor for CVD. Many clinical trials have been designed to evaluate pharmacologic compounds in the treatment of the dyslipidemias and they seem to have shown a safe profile, both in the experiment phases and in post-marketing observation studies. Nevertheless, sporadic reports of hepatotoxicity with statins and niacin still arise (Table 2). Although routine hepatic biochemical test monitoring is recommended, the cost-effectiveness is questionable because often these reactions are idiosyncratic and may not be identified by this routine screening. The risk/benefit ratio is in favor of using these medications in individuals at risk. There is no evidence to suggest intrinsic hepatotoxic activity as such. Drugs that lower triglycerides such as fibrates, have been observed to improve hepatic biochemical tests, although in small series. This leads to speculation whether treatment with fibrates would be beneficial for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition that is emerging as one of enormous magnitude.", 
    "149": "In the time of evidenced-based medicine results of randomised controlled trials with statins mostly are presented in terms of relative risk reduction and commonly declare this treatment to be \"lifesaving\". The way, how research data are presented, however, influences health care decisions and can greatly affect a physicians perception of treatment benefits and his willingness to prescribe. In addition, arguments for a lifesaving by statins are not supported by the underlying data, but show that in real terms the effect of the treatment is reduced to a relative short gain in lifetime depending also on age. E.g. the expected lifetime gain of a 45 year old high-risk patient due to therapy with statins is 2.3 years and only 0.7 years of a 70 year old patient. The lifetime gain is even much smaller in low risk patients (month only). From this point of view it is of note that lifelong treatment with statins must focus not only on risk reduction but also on the welfare of the patient in a comprehensive fashion. Therefore a small gain in lifespan may be sacrificed if the \"price\" gets too high (e.g. side effects of the drug, risks, troubles with compliance, reduced quality of life).", 
    "150": "Two recent observational studies have demonstrated a 60-73% reduction in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in patients treated with statins. In two further studies a polymorphism in the CYP46 gene encoding the cholesterol-24 hydroxylase was found to be associated with a significant increase in the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The question arises whether or not statins may exert a prophylactic effect on the incidence of Alzheimer's disease. Statins pass the blood-brain-barrier to a different degree and may reduce the cerebral cholesterol turnover. Statins may also influence the CSF concentration of tau protein, and, to a minor extent, that of A beta. Further studies are warranted to find out which statins are most suitable for reducing cerebral amyloid metabolism and whether statins may also lower the severity of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "151": "The statins do not only lower cholesterol. They may have also many other positive effects. The effects beyond lipid reduction are called pleiotropic effects. One of the most interesting points is the relationship between the statins and osteoporosis. They may stimulate bone formation and as a consequence they may reduce the risk of fracture. In the past years several studies were published concerning this topic. A number of observational studies found a decreased incidence of fractures among patients who take statins, but other studies did not. Prospective randomized controlled studies are necessary to exclude the possibility of unmeasured confounding variables. At the moment we have not enough data to give an answer to the question, if statins are a usefull opportunity in the treatment of osteoporosis. What we know now is, that the statins may be an interesting drug in the future for the treatment of osteoporosis, although many things are unclear, such as the right dose or the duration of treatment.", 
    "152": "Because of fatal cases of rhabdomyolysis the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor cerivastatin had to be withdrawn from the global market in 2001. The high frequency and severity of cerivastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis caused concerns about the safety of the entire class of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins). Still, the frequency of deadly incidents of rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin was 16 to 80 times higher than with other statins. This seems to be due to a combination of several pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of cerivastatin. Cerivastatin shows the highest oral bioavailability within its class. Interactions with other drugs like gemfibrocil may cause further elevation of cerivastatin plasma levels, thereby leading to higher frequencies of side effects in peripheral organs. With approximately 1 pM cerivastatin shows the lowest IC50 for inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase of all statins. The combination of high systemic drug levels and high intrinsic activity potentially leads to apoptosis and energy-depletion of skeletal-muscle cells. Therefore cerivastatin-associated fatal rhabdomyolysis seems to be based on specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of cerivastatin, and is not a general characteristic of all members of this drug-class. The experiences with cerivastatin support the importance of clinical studies even about well established drugs, and underline the relevance of precise reporting of adverse events by each physician.", 
    "153": "Hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase-inhibitors (HMG-CoA [statins]) are currently the most effective method to pharmacologically decrease total plasma cholesterol levels. A number of multicenter studies have demonstrated, that statins administered for several years lead to a significant reduction of cardiovascular events and mortality compared with placebo. Apart from the well known LDL- and cholesterol lowering effect, statins have been postulated to exert beneficial effects on mortality due to so called 'non-lipid effects'. There is circumstantial evidence from a number of experimental studies that statins can improve endothelial function, exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, stabilize arteriosclerotic plaque and inhibit proliferation and activation of smooth muscle cells. However, the clinical implications of these beneficial 'non-lipid effects' are unclear, but appear to exert only a minor role in comparison to the lowering effect of statins on total plasma cholesterol levels.", 
    "154": "The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes is a major problem for healthcare providers globally, since it is associated with serious microvascular and macrovascular complications. Although microvascular complications can be largely reduced with strict glycemic control, prevention of macrovascular disease involves a multifaceted approach that addresses all major risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin insensitivity. In particular, the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia is a major challenge for diabetologists and cardiologists, as it is characterized by an array of lipid abnormalities. The management of diabetic dyslipidemia should initially include lifestyle approaches such as improved nutrition and weight reduction; however, the majority of patients require the addition of pharmacotherapy. Whilst insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic drugs are generally prescribed for the treatment of hyperglycemia, the addition of lipid-lowering drugs may be necessary for the control of diabetic dyslipidemia. The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as a first priority. Hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are recommended for first-line therapy in diabetic patients, since these agents are effective at reducing LDL-C levels. Whilst statins provide effective control of dyslipidemia in the majority of patients, more efficacious treatment regimens would provide greater benefit to more patients. Combination therapies may provide one solution to obtaining maximal lipid profile modifications, although the introduction of new, more efficacious agents for use as monotherapy may provide a more acceptable option, as drug combinations are often associated with poor tolerability and patient compliance."
