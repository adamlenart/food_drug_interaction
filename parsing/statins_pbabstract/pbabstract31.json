We term the pathological UPR that causes fatty liver disease a \"stressed UPR.\" Here we investigate the mechanism of stressed UPR activation in zebrafish bearing a mutation in thetrappc11gene, which encodes a component of the transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex.trappc11mutants are characterized by secretory pathway defects, reflecting disruption of the TRAPP complex. In addition, we uncover a defect in protein glycosylation intrappc11mutants that is associated with reduced levels of lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) and compensatory up-regulation of genes in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway that produces the LLO anchor dolichol. Treating wild-type larvae with terpenoid or LLO synthesis inhibitors phenocopies the stressed UPR seen intrappc11mutants and is synthetically lethal withtrappc11mutation. We propose that reduced LLO level causing hypoglycosylation is a mechanism of stressed UPR induction intrappc11mutants. Of importance, in human cells, depletion of TRAPPC11, but not other TRAPP components, causes protein hypoglycosylation, and lipid droplets accumulate in fibroblasts from patients with theTRAPPC11mutation.

Objective Very little is known about the potential efficacy of combination of these two agents to potentiate TNF-induced apoptosis in human chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). Materials and methods In the present study, we investigated whether SV combined with BGM mediates its effect through suppression of NF-\u03baB-signalling pathway. Results We found that the combination treatment enhanced cytotoxicity and potentiated the apoptosis induced by TNF as indicated by intracellular esterase activity, Annexin V staining and caspase activation. This effect of co-treatment correlated with down-regulation of various gene products that mediate cell proliferation (cyclin D1), cell survival (cIAP-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Survivin), invasion (MMP-9) and angiogenesis (VEGF); all known to be regulated by NF-\u03baB. SV combined with BGM also produced TNF-induced cell-cycle arrest in S-phase and this arrest correlated with a concomitant increase in the levels of cyclin-dependent inhibitor p21 and p27. The combination therapy inhibited TNF-induced NF-\u03baB activation, I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation and p65 translocation to the nucleus as compared with the treatment with individual agents alone. Besides, SV combined with BGM did not significantly potentiate apoptotic effect induced by TNF in p65(-)(/)(-) cells, as compared with wild-type fibroblasts.

HIPPO signaling regulates specification of the trophectoderm lineage of the mouse blastocyst by controlling the nuclear localization of YAP. In human cell lines, the mevalonate pathway regulates YAP to mediate self-renewal and survival through geranylgeranylation of RHO proteins. These studies suggest that in preimplantation development, statins may act through HIPPO pathway to interfere with trophectoderm specification and thereby inhibit blastocyst formation.",

Efficiency of blastocyst formation was assessed based on gross morphology and the measurement of the cavity size using an image analysis software. Effects on cell lineages and HIPPO signaling were analyzed using immunohistochemistry with confocal microscopy based on the expression patterns of the lineage-specific markers and the nuclear accumulation of YAP.

These results indicate that HMG-CoA reductase activity is required for blastocyst formation mainly through the production of GGPP but not cholesterol. Inhibition of RHO proteins, known targets of geranylgeranylation, impaired blastocyst formation, which was not reversed by GGPP supplementation. Nuclear localization of YAP was diminished by statin treatment but fully restored by supplementation of MVA (P < 0.01) or GGPP (P < 0.01). This suggests that HIPPO signaling is regulated by GGPP-dependent mechanisms, possibly geranylgeranylation of RHO, to enable trophectoderm formation.

Thirty-six-week-old male SHRs were randomly divided into four groups: 1) SHR control group; 2) amlodipine alone (10\u2009mg/kg/d) group, 3) atorvastatin alone (10\u2009mg/kg/d) group, 4) combination of amlodinpine and atorvastatin (10\u2009mg/kg/d for each) group. Same gender, weight, and age of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with normal blood pressure were used as normal control. Drugs were administered by oral gavage over 12 weeks. The thicknesses of left ventricle walls, left ventricle weight, and cardiac function were measured by transthoracic echocardiography. Left ventricular pressure and function were assessed by hemodynamic examination. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen accumulation in cardiac tissue were measured by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Masson staining, respectively. The hydroxyproline content of cardiac tissue was examined by biochemistry technique. RANKL, RANK and OPG mRNA, protein expression and tissue localization were studied by RT-PCR, Immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Treatment with amlodipine or atorvastatin alone significantly decreased left ventricular mass index, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and interstitial fibrosis in SHR (each P\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, combined amlodipine and atorvastatin treatment induced significant reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy and decreased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and interstitial fibrosis in SHR to a greater extent than each agent alone (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Compared with WKY rats, the myocardial expression of RANKL, RANK, and OPG was increased. Both amlodipine and atorvastatin reduced RANKL, RANK, and OPG expression, with the best effects seen with the combination.

In agreement with this finding, the AUC of rosuvastatin (RSV) in cynomolgus monkeys increased when OATP1B inhibitors were coadministered. In Oatp1a/1b gene cluster knockout mice (Oatp1a/1b(-/-)), CPs in plasma and urine were significantly increased compared with wild-type animals (7.1- to 18.4-fold; P < 0.001), which were also in agreement with the changes in plasma RSV exposure (14.6-fold increase).

Hepatic and systemic hemodynamics, liver injury (AST, ALT, LDH), endothelial function (vasodilatation in response to acetylcholine), KLF2 and nitric oxide pathways, oxidative stress, inflammation (neutrophil and macrophage infiltration) and cell death were evaluated. Profound microcirculatory dysfunction occurred rapidly following WIR. This was evidenced by down-regulation of the KLF2 vasoprotective pathway, impaired vasodilatory capability and endothelial activation, altogether leading to increased hepatic vascular resistance and liver inflammation, with significant leukocyte infiltration, oxidative stress and cell death. Simvastatin preserved the hepatic endothelial phenotype, and blunted the detrimental effects of WIR on liver hemodynamics and organ integrity. In conclusion, WIR-induced injury to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells is mitigated by pre-treatment with Simvastatin probably through a KLF2-dependent mechanism.",

In this brief report, additional details for the studies included in the analysis, and further supporting data, including mean of the maximum CCA/cIMT changes and subgroup data (mean and maximum CCA/cIMT) are provided. For the analysis, study-level data was extracted from 17 statin cIMT trials conducted during 1988-2006, selected on the basis of having at least one statin monotherapy arm in the absence of mixed therapy, and baseline- and study-end values for mean mean and mean maximum CCA/cIMT endpoints. The baseline mean CCA/cIMT, maximum mean CCA/cIMT and LDL-C levels, and annualized cIMT changes were estimated for the overall studies, those conducted before/after 2000, and in risk-based subgroups. Interestingly, all 8 studies conducted before 2000 were significant for cIMT change in which patients did not receive prior LLT; whereas after 2000, the results were more variable and in 4 of 6 trials that did not show a significant cIMT change, patients had received prior treatment. Baseline mean maximum cIMT and LDL-C levels, and annualized changes in studies conducted before 2000 were higher than those conducted after 2000, similar to the results reported in the original article for the mean mean cIMT endpoint. These findings were consistent across study populations of patients with CHD risk versus those without, and in studies with greater LDL-C reductions and with thickened baseline cIMT at study entry for both mean and maximum cIMT changes.

It is thought to play an important role in the etiology of multiple myeloma and osteolysis. Thus, inhibiting MIP-1\u03b1 expression may be useful in developing therapeutic treatments for multiple myeloma-induced osteolysis. In this study, we investigated the potential of statins to inhibit mRNA expression and secretion of MIP-1\u03b1 in mouse myeloma cells (MOPC-31C). We found that statins inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced MIP-1\u03b1 mRNA expression and protein secretion in MOPC-31C cells. This inhibition was reversed when farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), intermediates of the mevalonate pathway, were combined with statins. Furthermore, statins reduced the GTP form of Ras, a phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and phosphorylated Akt. Our results indicate that statins inhibit biosynthesis of FPP and GGPP and thereby down regulate signal transduction of Ras/ERK and Ras/Akt pathways. The net effect suppresses LPS-induced MIP-1\u03b1 mRNA expression and protein secretion in MOPC-31C cells. Thus, statins hold great promise for developing effective therapies against myeloma-induced osteolysis.",

Hypocholesterolaemic drugs such as statins are among the most prescribed human pharmaceuticals in western European countries. In vertebrates, this therapeutic class disrupts the cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), responsible for the limiting step in the mevalonate pathway. Recently, functional studies have shown that statins competitively inhibit HMGR in vertebrates and arthropods, two taxa that have diverged over 450 million years ago. Importantly, chronic simvastatin exposure disrupts crustacean reproduction and development at environmentally relevant concentrations. Hence, a fundamental question emerges: what is the taxonomic scope of statins-induced HMGR inhibition across metazoans? Here, we address this central question in a large sampling of metazoans using comparative genomics, homology modelling and molecular docking. Sequence alignment of metazoan HMGRs allowed the annotation of highly conserved catalytic, co-factor and substrate binding sites, including residues highjacked for statin binding. Furthermore, molecular docking shows that the catalytic domains of metazoan HMGRs are highly conserved regarding interactions, not only with HMG-CoA, but also with both simvastatin and atorvastatin, the top prescribed statins in Europe and USA. Hence, the data indicates that both statins are expected to competitively inhibit metazoan's HMGRs, and therefore all metazoan taxa might be at risk. The environmental relevance of these findings are discussed and research priorities established. We believe that the conceptual framework used in this study can be applied to other emerging pollutants and assist in the design of toxicity testing and risk assessment.",

Aberrant glycosylation on surface proteins is associated with different cellular statuses and disease progression. However, it is extraordinarily challenging to comprehensively and site-specifically analyze glycoproteins located only on the cell surface. Currently mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics provides the possibility to analyze the N-glycoproteome, but effective separation and enrichment methods are required for the analysis of surface glycoproteins prior to MS measurement. The introduction of bio-orthogonal groups into proteins accelerates research in the robust visualization, identification, and quantification of proteins. Here we have comprehensively evaluated different sugar analogs in the analysis of cell-surface N-glycoproteins by combining copper-free click chemistry and MS-based proteomics. Comparison of three sugar analogs, N-azidoacetylgalactosamine (GalNAz), N-azidoacetylglucosamine (GlcNAz), and N-azidoacetylmannosamine (ManNAz), showed that metabolic labeling with GalNAz resulted in the greatest number of glycoproteins and glycosylation sites in biological duplicate experiments. GalNAz was then employed for the quantification experiment in statin-treated HepG2 liver cells, and 280 unique N-glycosylated sites were quantified from 168 surface proteins. The quantification results demonstrated that many glycosylation sites on surface proteins were down-regulated in statin-treated cells compared to untreated cells because statin prevents the synthesis of dolichol, which is essential for the formation of dolichol-linked precursor oligosaccharides. Several glycosylation sites in proteins that participate in the Alzheimer's disease pathway were down-regulated. This method can be extensively applied for the global analysis of the cell-surface N-glycoproteome.", 
    "208": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation, is a cytoprotective enzyme upregulated in the vasculature by increased flow and inflammatory stimuli. Human genetic data suggest that a diminished HO-1 expression may predispose one to abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. In addition, heme is known to strongly induce HO-1 expression. Utilizing the porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) model of AAA induction in HO-1 heterozygous (HO-1+/-, HO-1 Het) mice, we found that a deficiency in HO-1 leads to augmented AAA development. Peritoneal macrophages from HO-1+/- mice showed increased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including MCP-1, TNF-alpha, IL-1-beta, and IL-6, but decreased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta. Furthermore, treatment with heme returned AAA progression in HO-1 Het mice to a wild-type profile. Using a second murine AAA model (Ang II-ApoE-/-), we showed that low doses of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin can induce HO-1 expression in aortic tissue and suppress AAA progression in the absence of lipid lowering. Our results support those studies that suggest that pleiotropic statin effects might be beneficial in AAA, possibly through the upregulation of HO-1. Specific targeted therapies designed to induce HO-1 could become an adjunctive therapeutic strategy for the prevention of AAA disease.",

After a long dry period, the field of therapeutics targeted to lipids and atherosclerosis has entered a renaissance. Moreover, the demonstration of clinical benefits from the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy in subjects with acute coronary syndromes has renewed the enthusiasm for the cholesterol hypothesis and the hope that additional agents that lower low-density lipoprotein will decrease risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Drugs in the orphan disease category are now available for patients with the most extreme hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, discovery and rapid translation of a novel biological pathway has given rise to a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin-9 inhibitors. Trials of niacin added to statin have failed to demonstrate cardiac benefits, and 3 cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors have also failed to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, despite producing substantial increases in HDL levels. Although the utility of triglyceride-lowering therapies remains uncertain, 2 large clinical trials are testing the influence of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on atherosclerotic events in hypertriglyceridemia. Novel antisense therapies targeting apolipoprotein C-III (for triglyceride reduction) and apo(a) (for lipoprotein(a) reduction) are showing a promising trajectory.

Furthermore, a total of 202 independent signals in 109 loci have achieved a false discovery rate (q<0.05) and together explain 28% of the estimated heritability of CAD. These data have been used successfully to create genetic risk scores that can improve risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors and identify those individuals who will benefit most from statin therapy. Such information also has important applications in clinical medicine and drug discovery by using a Mendelian randomization approach to interrogate the causal nature of many factors found to associate with CAD risk in epidemiological studies. In contrast to genome-wide association studies, whole-exome sequencing has provided valuable information directly relevant to genes with known roles in plasma lipoprotein metabolism but has, thus far, failed to identify other rare coding variants linked to CAD. Overall, recent studies have led to a broader understanding of the genetic architecture of CAD and demonstrate that it largely derives from the cumulative effect of multiple common risk alleles individually of small effect size rather than rare variants with large effects on CAD risk. Despite this success, there has been limited progress in understanding the function of the novel loci; the majority of which are in noncoding regions of the genome.",

This modality is highly useful for cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification among individuals without known coronary heart disease (CHD), especially for those at intermediate risk. The presence of CAC is associated with up to a 10-fold higher risk of adverse CV events, even after fully adjusting for the standard CV risk factors. In fact, the CAC score is among the strongest clinically available predictors of future risk of adverse CV events among primary prevention patients. Additionally, the absence of CAC in asymptomatic individuals confers a very low risk of CV events. Even in the presence of a benign CV risk factor profile and normal cardiac stress test, a very high CAC score portends a high risk of adverse CV events. On the other hand, a CAC score of zero is associated with a low CHD risk despite significant CV risk factor profiles. CAC scoring is a quick, low-cost screening tool to help risk-stratify patients and identify those likely to benefit from aggressive preventive treatments (such as high-intensity statin therapy, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, and aspirin) and to identify those likely who warrant close monitoring. Moreover, individuals with a zero CAC score may be at low enough risk to avoid or defer daily aspirin therapy and pharmacological therapy for cholesterol management, and instead work on therapeutic lifestyle changes.

Determination of its side effects on different tissues is mandatory to improve safe use of this drug. In the present study, the effects of simvastatin on molecular composition and structure of healthy rat livers were investigated by Fourier transform infrared and Raman imaging. Simvastatin-treated groups received 50 mg/kg/day simvastatin for 30 days. The ratio of the area and/or intensity of the bands assigned to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids were calculated to get information about the drug-induced changes in tissues. Loss of unsaturation, accumulation of end products of lipid peroxidation, and alterations in lipid-to-protein ratio were observed in the treated group. Protein secondary structure studies revealed significant decrease in \u03b1-helix and increase in random coil, while native \u03b2-sheet decreases and aggregated \u03b2-sheet increases in treated group implying simvastatin-induced protein denaturation. Moreover, groups were successfully discriminated using principal component analysis.

Using the Electronically Retrieved Cohort of HCV Infected Veterans (ERCHIVES) database, we identified all subjects initiated on HCV antibody (anti-HCV) therapy from 2001 to 2014, and all incident cases of cirrhosis and HCC. Statin use was measured using cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD). Multivariable Cox's proportional hazard regression models were used to examine the relationship between statin use and development of cirrhosis and HCC. Among 9,135 eligible subjects, 1,649 developed cirrhosis and 239 developed incident HCC. Statin use was associated with a 44% reduction in development of cirrhosis (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53, 0.68). The adjusted HRs (95% CI) of fibrosis progression with statin cDDD 28-89, 89-180, and >180 were 0.74 (0.59, 0.93), 0.71 (0.59, 0.88), and 0.6 (0.53, 0.68), respectively.

    "250": "Autophagy has recently emerged as an important cellular process for the maintenance of skeletal muscle health and function. Excessive autophagy can trigger muscle catabolism, leading to atrophy. In contrast, reduced autophagic flux is a characteristic of several muscle diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common and severe inherited muscle disorder. Recent evidence demonstrates that enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by CYBB/NOX2 impairs autophagy in muscles from the dmd/mdx mouse, a genetic model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Statins decrease CYBB/NOX2 expression and activity and stimulate autophagy in skeletal muscle. Therefore, we treated dmd/mdx mice with simvastatin and showed decreased CYBB/NOX2-mediated oxidative stress and enhanced autophagy induction. This was accompanied by reduced muscle damage, inflammation and fibrosis, and increased muscle force production. Our data suggest that increased autophagy may be a potential mechanism by which simvastatin improves skeletal muscle health and function in muscular dystrophy.",

Among matched patients (n\u2009=\u200951,764), women initially treated with LLT were significantly less likely to receive a prescription for a higher potency LLT. Even among those with LDL-C levels above 160\u2009mg/dL, women were more likely to discontinue LLT, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.8 (1.2-2.3). Female gender and older age were significant predictors of discontinuation, and the potency of the index medication was the strongest predictor of dose titration. Initially untreated women were less likely to initiate LLT treatment than men, irrespective of index LDL-C levels (p\u2009<\u20090.0001).",

Because adverse effects with statins are usually the result of drug-drug interactions, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of FA against human CYP3A4 and clinically relevant drug transporters such as organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, multidrug resistant protein 1, and breast cancer resistance protein, which are involved in the oral absorption and/or systemic clearance of statins including atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. FA was a weak reversible (IC50= 295 \u00b1 1.0\u03bcM) and time-dependent (KI= 216 \u00b1 41\u03bcM and kinact= 0.0179 \u00b1 0.001 min(-1)) inhibitor of CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam-1'-hydroxylase activity in human liver microsomes. FA demonstrated inhibition of multidrug resistant protein 1-mediated digoxin transport with an IC50 value of 157 \u00b1 1.0\u03bcM and was devoid of breast cancer resistance protein inhibition (IC50> 500\u03bcM). In contrast, FA showed potent inhibition of OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-specific rosuvastatin transport with IC50 values of 1.59\u03bcM and 2.47\u03bcM, respectively. Furthermore, coadministration of oral rosuvastatin and FA to rats led to an approximately 19.3-fold and 24.6-fold increase in the rosuvastatin maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve, respectively, which could be potentially mediated through inhibitory effects of FA on rat Oatp1a4 (IC50= 2.26\u03bcM) and Oatp1b2 (IC50= 4.38\u03bcM) transporters, which are responsible for rosuvastatin uptake in rat liver. The potent inhibition of human OATP1B1/OATP1B3 by FA could attenuate hepatic uptake of statins, resulting in increased blood and tissue concentrations, potentially manifesting in musculoskeletal toxicity.",

TEBVs with 400-800 \u03bcM diameters were made by embedding human neonatal dermal fibroblasts or human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in dense collagen gel. TEBVs were mechanically strong enough to allow endothelialization and perfusion at physiological shear stresses within 3 hours after fabrication. After 1 week of perfusion, TEBVs exhibited endothelial release of nitric oxide, phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction, and acetylcholine-induced vasodilation, all of which were maintained up to 5 weeks in culture. Vasodilation was blocked with the addition of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-N(G)-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME). TEBVs elicited reversible activation to acute inflammatory stimulation by TNF-\u03b1 which had a transient effect upon acetylcholine-induced relaxation, and exhibited dose-dependent vasodilation in response to caffeine and theophylline. Treatment of TEBVs with 1 \u03bcM lovastatin for three days prior to addition of Tumor necrosis factor - \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) blocked the injury response and maintained vasodilation.

This study intends to compare the association between lipid profile and serum PON1 levels in renal failure (RF) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum lipids, HDL-subclasses and PON1 concentration were evaluated in 90 patients with CKD, divided into groups: RF (n\u2009=\u200946) and HD (n\u2009=\u200944), and in 30 normal individuals (control group). The results showed that PON1 was significantly lower in HD patients than in RF and controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In RF patients under statin therapy, PON1 did not differ from that of patients without statins. In HD patients without statins, PON1 was considerably low, whereas in HD with statins (30.42\u2009\u00b1\u200912.62\u2009\u03bcg/mL) was lower than RF with statins (49.31\u2009\u00b1\u200914.94, p\u2009<\u20090.001). PON1 concentration was significantly and positively associated with HDL-C, HDL3-C and Apo A1 in all groups. Additionally, in HD patients PON1 was negatively associated with LDL-C. Multiple regression analysis revealed that LDL-C and statin treatment were independently related to PON1 concentration in HD patients (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009-0.331, p\u2009=\u20090.026 and \u03b2\u2009=\u20090.344, p\u2009=\u20090.020, respectively).

    "271": "Cholesterol is detrimental to human health in excess but is also essential for normal embryogenesis. Hence, enzymes involved in its synthesis possess many layers of regulation to achieve balanced cholesterol levels. 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) is the terminal enzyme of cholesterol synthesis in the Kandutsch-Russell pathway, converting 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to cholesterol. In the absence of functional DHCR7, accumulation of 7DHC and a lack of cholesterol production leads to the devastating developmental disorder, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. This study identifies that statin treatment can ameliorate the low DHCR7 expression seen with common Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome mutations. Furthermore, we show that wild-type DHCR7 is also relatively labile. In an example of end-product inhibition, cholesterol accelerates the proteasomal degradation of DHCR7, resulting in decreased protein levels and activity. The loss of enzymatic activity results in the accumulation of the substrate 7DHC, which leads to an increased production of vitamin D. Thus, these findings highlight DHCR7 as an important regulatory switch between cholesterol and vitamin D synthesis."
