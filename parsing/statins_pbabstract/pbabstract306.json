First, the limited data available suggest a halt in the declining incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the United States since 1990, raising concerns about our current strategies to promote primary prevention of CAD. Data from the 1970s and 1980s support a key role for population-wide cholesterol lowering as a strategy to reduce CAD. Second, large and carefully performed surveys support no further reductions in serum cholesterol levels in the US population since 1990. Is this observation and that of stagnating declines of CAD incidence a coincidence? Interestingly, the lack of cholesterol level reduction occurred in the setting of increased use of prescription cholesterol-lowering drugs, suggesting that drug treatment of the highest-risk persons alone will not shift the population curve. Third, the treatment gap persists, with recent population-wide data suggesting that half of all people with hypercholesterolemia (>/=200 mg/dL) are unaware of their condition, only half of those persons aware are treated, and only half of those treated are controlled. Finally, the moderate-risk population (10% to 20% risk of CAD over 10 years) is sizable in the ages recommended for over-the-counter statin use (>/=45 years in men, >/=55 years in women). Risk reduction in this group, which contributes a significant portion of CAD cases, should be part of any program to reduce the population burden of CAD.",

Many recipients have preexisting cardiovascular disease at the time of transplantation, and immunosuppressive therapy may aggravate existing risk factors or promote development of new risk factors, notably hyperlipidemia and hypertension. Fluvastatin is one of the statins, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, which has been shown to be effective in lowering cholesterol levels.

Thirty-three recipients were ABO-compatible, seven recipients had minor mismatches, and five recipients were ABO-incompatible. The dose of fluvastatin was 20 mg per day. Levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), serum creatinine (s-Cr), ALT, ALP, uric acid (UA), hematocrit (Ht), CPK, and blood pressure were examined in all recipients before treatment as well as 1, 3, and 6 months after Fluvastatin administration.",

    "11": "Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins) are first-line treatments for hypercholesterolemia. Although exceedingly well tolerated, treatment with statins incurs a small risk of myopathy or potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, particularly when coadministered with medications that increase their systemic exposure. Studies compared the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic interaction profiles of pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin when coadministered with 4 inhibitors of cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzymes in healthy subjects. Compared with pravastatin alone, coadministration of verapamil, mibefradil, or itraconazole with pravastatin was associated with no significant changes in pravastatin pharmacokinetics. However, concomitant verapamil increased the simvastatin area under the concentration:time curve (AUC) approximately fourfold, the maximum serum concentration (C(max)) fivefold, and the active metabolite simvastatin acid AUC and C(max) approximately four- and threefold, respectively (all comparisons p <0.001). Similar (greater than fourfold) important increases in these parameters and a >60% increase in the serum half-life (p = 0.03) of atorvastatin were observed when coadministered with mibefradil. The half-life of atorvastatin also increased by approximately 60% (p = 0.052) when coadministered with itraconazole, which elicited a 2.4-fold increase in the C(max) of atorvastatin and a 47% increase in the AUC (p <0.001 for C(max) and AUC). Clarithromycin significantly (p <0.001) increased the AUC (and C(max)) of all 3 statins, most markedly simvastatin ( approximately 10-fold increase in AUC) and simvastatin acid (12-fold), followed by atorvastatin (greater than fourfold) and then pravastatin (almost twofold). Pravastatin has a neutral drug interaction profile relative to cytochrome P450-3A4 inhibitors, but these substrates markedly increase systemic exposure to simvastatin and atorvastatin.", 
    "12": "Statins improve survival in patients with coronary artery disease, especially those with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Although some randomized studies have shown a delay in statin-related survival advantage of up to 2 years, recent studies demonstrated early (<2 months) survival benefit in certain patient groups. We hypothesized that this early benefit relates to baseline CRP concentration. Patients (n = 2,924) with significant, angiographically defined coronary artery disease (>/=70% stenosis in >/=1 coronary artery) were followed for an average of 2.4 years after discharged on a statin prescription. CRP was divided into tertiles (<1.2, 1.2 to 1.7, >1.7 mg/dl), and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to determine timing of statin benefit in both the overall population and a propensity score-matched subgroup. Cox regressions (multivariable and propensity score approaches) were used to predict mortality. Statins were prescribed for 28.4% of patients. In the first CRP tertile, no early statin benefit was observed (adjusted hazard ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30 to 1.6, p = 0.39), and survival curves separated after >2 years. However, in the second and the third tertiles, statin survival curves separated much earlier ( approximately 3 months and 1 week, respectively) and statins predicted improved survival (second tertile: hazard ratio 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.2, p = 0.17; third tertile: hazard ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.67, p = 0.002). Propensity score analysis confirmed both statin benefit and early timing. Thus, statin use in patients with high CRP provides not only a larger but also a significantly earlier absolute survival benefit than statin use in patients with lower CRP. This provides further evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect of statins.",

    "15": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a catheter-based technique which provides high-resolution cross-sectional images of both, coronary lumen and vessel wall. Various scientific studies recently established IVUS as a valuable tool for the assessment of the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis and the effect of different pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on progression-regression of atherosclerosis. Novel technical approaches that use IVUS radiofrequency data may provide further interesting information on vessel wall characteristics but require further validation. In addition, numerous trials applied IVUS to assess the short- and long-term outcome of different percutaneous coronary interventions, including the implantation of drug-eluting stents. Besides the importance of IVUS in the field of scientific trials, IVUS can be clinically helpful for the evaluation of angiographically ambiguous lesions, guidance of catheter-based interventions, and management of complications. Settings in which IVUS may be particular useful are: ostial and bifurcation lesions; the presence of diffuse atherosclerotic disease; severely calcified or very tight lesions; relatively small vessels; diabetic patients; and if multiple, long or novel stents are implanted. This article gives an overview on the value of IVUS for the assessment of coronary atherosclerosis and percutaneous coronary interventions. In this context, we reviewed a selection of recently published IVUS studies which provide interesting new information in this field.", 
    "16": "Soy intake reduces cholesterol levels. However, both the identity of the soy component or components that contribute to this reduction and the cellular mechanism producing this reduction are unknown. Soy consists of protein, lipids, fiber, and phytochemicals including isoflavones. We propose that the isoflavone component of soy mediates this effect, at least in part, by affecting cellular sterol homeostasis. We investigated the effects of an isoflavone-containing soy extract and the individual isoflavones on the maturation of the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP) and the expression of SRE-regulated genes controlling lipid metabolism. We found a corresponding increase in the mature form of SREBP-2 in both soy extract- and isoflavone-treated HepG2 cells, whereas there was no significant change in the levels of SREBP-1. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase protein and HMG CoA synthase mRNA levels also increased. When HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with HMG CoA synthase and LDL receptor reporter plasmids there was an increase in expression in response to soy extract or isoflavone treatment from both of these promoters, but this induction was blunted in the presence of sterols (P < 0.05). The mechanism responsible for this effect may be via a statin-like inhibition of HMG CoA reductase enzyme activity or by enhanced SREBP processing via the SREBP cleavage activating protein. We hypothesize that maturation of SREBP and induction of SRE-regulated genes produce an increase in surface LDL receptor expression that increases the clearance of plasma cholesterol, thus decreasing plasma cholesterol levels.",

We investigated the effect of statins on LXR target gene expression and cholesterol efflux from human macrophages.", 
    "18": "In human macrophages (THP-1 cell line and primary cells), the archetypal statin, compactin, greatly reduced mRNA levels of 2 LXR target genes, ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA, as well as decreased cholesterol efflux. Commonly prescribed statins also downregulated LXR target gene expression in THP-1 cells. We provide several lines of evidence indicating that statins decrease expression of LXR target genes by inhibiting the synthesis of an oxysterol ligand for LXR, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. When THP-1 cells were cholesterol-loaded via incubation with acetylated low-density lipoprotein, synthesis of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol was greatly reduced and the downregulatory effect of compactin on ABCA1 mRNA levels and cholesterol efflux was lost.",

Subsequently, HC diet feeding was continued or mice received HC supplemented with 0.002% (w/w) atorvastatin (HC+A), resulting in 19% plasma cholesterol lowering, or mice received a low-cholesterol (LC) diet to establish a plasma cholesterol level similar to that achieved in the HC+A group. HC+A and LC diet reduced, significantly and to the same extent, lesion progression and complication in the aortic root, as assessed by measuring total atherosclerotic lesion area, lesion severity, and macrophage and smooth muscle cell area. In the aortic arch, HC+A but not LC blocked lesion progression. HC+A and LC reduced vascular inflammation (ie, expression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor , plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, matrix metalloproteinase-9), but HC+A additionally suppressed vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression and, in parallel, monocyte adhesion. In contrast, low-dose atorvastatin showed no antiinflammatory action toward hepatic inflammation markers (serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein [CRP]) in apoE*3-Leiden mice and human CRP transgenic mice.",

The relative risk reduction for stroke was 21% (odds ratio [OR], 0.79 [0.73 to 0.85]), with no heterogeneity between trials. Fatal strokes were reduced but not significantly: by 9% (OR, 0.91 [0.76 to 1.10]). There was no increase in hemorrhagic strokes (OR, 0.90 [0.65 to 1.22]). Statin size effect was closely associated with LDL-C reduction. Each 10% reduction in LDL-C was estimated to reduce the risk of all strokes by 15.6% (95% CI, 6.7 to 23.6) and carotid IMT by 0.73% per year (95% CI, 0.27 to 1.19).",

In presented work the influence of acetylsalicylic acid, metoprolol, simvastatin, isosorbide mononitrate and molsidomine on total activity of adenosine deaminase and its isoenzymes--ADA1 and ADA2 in vivo was studied. We have affirmed that simvastatin decreased of tADA activity by 50%, acetylsalicylic acid by 34%, metoprolol by 29.1% and isosorbide mononitrate by 19.3%. Only after molsidomine administration were no significant changes in ADA activity observed. The result showed that the decline of ADA activity was mainly due to marked decrease in ADA2 isoenzyme.",

CRF-induced dyslipidemia is marked by hypertriglyceridemia and a shift in plasma cholesterol from HDL to the ApoB-containing lipoproteins. Several studies have demonstrated a favorable response to administration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in CRF. This study was intended to explore the effect of statin therapy on key enzymes and receptors involved in cholesterol metabolism. Accordingly, CRF (5/6 nephrectomized) and sham-operated rats were randomized to untreated and statin-treated (rosuvastatin 20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) groups and observed for 6 wk. The untreated CRF rats exhibited increased total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, diminished plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and the hepatic LDL receptor, elevated hepatic acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), and no change in hepatic HMG-CoA reductase, cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, or HDL receptor (SRB-1). Statin administration lowered HMG-CoA reductase activity, normalized plasma LCAT, total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, and hepatic LDL receptor but did not significantly change either plasma total cholesterol, hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, total ACAT activity, or SRB-1 in the CRF animals. Statin administration to the normal control rats led to significant increases in plasma LCAT and hepatic LDL receptor, significant reductions of total cholesterol-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity, and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase abundance with virtually no change in plasma cholesterol concentration. Thus administration of rosuvastatin reversed LCAT and LDL receptor deficiencies and promoted a shift in plasma cholesterol from ApoB-containing lipoproteins to HDL in CRF rats.",

Statins were the first lipid-lowering agents, which, within a framework of a clinical trial, actually extended life by mechanisms that probably go beyond cholesterol alone. Their benefits are so impressive that some enthusiasts have been emboldened to write that they 'are to atherosclerosis what penicillin was to infectious disease'. But is Nature as easily tamed as we might imagine? Some individuals show a modest or even poor response to statin therapy. The recent discovery of ezetimibe, a highly efficient and precise cholesterol absorption inhibitor, has proven to be a very effective cholesterol lowering alternative for them and combining statins with ezetimibe, thereby inhibiting cholesterol absorption and endogenous synthesis, takes us to realms of cholesterol lowering capability that could not have been dreamt of a decade ago.",

To better understand the mechanism of statin-induced myopathy, we examined the ability of structurally distinct statins to induce apoptosis in an optimized rat myotube model. Compound A (a lactone) and Cerivastatin (an open acid) induced apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL and active caspase 3 staining, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, an epimer of Compound A (Compound B) exhibited a much weaker apoptotic response. Statin-induced apoptosis was completely prevented by mevalonate or geranylgeraniol, but not by farnesol. Zaragozic acid A, a squalene synthase inhibitor, caused no apoptosis on its own and had no effect on Compound-A-induced myotoxicity, suggesting the apoptosis was not a result of cholesterol synthesis inhibition. The geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors GGTI-2133 and GGTI-2147 caused apoptosis in myotubes; the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277 exhibited a much weaker effect. In addition, the prenylation of rap1a, a geranylgeranylated protein, was inhibited by Compound A in myotubes at concentrations that induced apoptosis. A similar statin-induced apoptosis profile was seen in human myotube cultures but primary rat hepatocytes were about 200-fold more resistant to statin-induced apoptosis. Although the statin-induced hepatotoxicity could be attenuated with mevalonate, no effect was found with either geranylgeraniol or farnesol. In studies assessing ubiquinone levels after statin treatment in rat and human myotubes, there was no correlation between ubiquinone levels and apoptosis. Taken together, these observations suggest that statins cause apoptosis in myotube cultures in part by inhibiting the geranylgeranylation of proteins, but not by suppressing ubiquinone concentration. Furthermore, the data from primary hepatocytes suggests a cell-type differential sensitivity to statin-induced toxicity.",

To support the development of these agents (statins) as potential hypocholesterolemic drugs, a variety of preclinical studies were conducted in several animal species. Not unexpectedly due to the central role played by mevalonic acid and its products including cholesterol in development and maintenance of cellular homeostasis, administration of high dosage levels of these agents led to the expression of a broad variety of adverse effects in many different tissues. Using the tools of toxicologic pathology and classical risk assessment, these varied toxicities were evaluated by many groups relative to the conditions of use in human therapy and a perspective was developed on potential human risk. These approaches of mechanism-based risk assessment predicted that most of the adverse effects observed in animals would not be seen under conditions of human use and supported the successful introduction of one of the most important classes of human medicines.",

However, it is unclear whether the vascular NAD(P)H oxidase is involved in the endothelial dysfunction of congestive heart failure (CHF) and whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) exert their vasoprotective effects in CHF. The present study examined both the involvement of vascular NAD(P)H oxidase in endothelial dysfunction in dogs with tachycardia-induced CHF and the therapeutic effect of a statin (pitavastatin).",

Vascular O(2)- production, NAD(P)H oxidase activity and Nox4 and p47phox expression were significantly elevated in CHF compared with the normal group. The elevated O(2)-production in the CHF group was suppressed by the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, apocynin, to the normal level. In contrast, neither the gene expression nor the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) differed significantly between the normal and CHF groups. However, pitavastatin significantly suppressed O(2)- production, NAD(P)H oxidase activity and Nox4 and p47phox expression and increased eNOS expression and activity compared with the CHF group.",

The mRNA levels of apo A-I, PPAR alpha, CYP7A1, and FXR similarly increased with increasing doses of pitavastatin. Coincubation of mevalonate (4 mmol/L) with pitavastatin (5 micromol/L) reversed the inductive effects of pitavastatin on the mRNA levels of these genes, indicating that the inductive effects of pitavastatin were related to its inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.",

Although highly efficacious, this new statin has generated considerable controversy regarding its safety. Rosuvastatin was approved for clinical use based on the largest pre-approval database for all statins prior to commercial use. In this database, rosuvastatin had a similar safety profile to other approved statins up to the highest approval dose of 40 mg. As with all statins, there is a marked increase in adverse effects when the dose is titrated from 40 to 80 mg, and rosuvastatin demonstrates a similar dose/toxicity relationship. In the pre-approval data trials on 80 mg, there was a 1.0% (n = 16) incidence of myopathy and 7 patients developed rhabdomyolysis. However the <or= 40 mg doses had a myopathy rate similar to other statins. In the post-marketing surveillance for rosuvastatin, there have been reports of rhabdomyolysis, but the incidence rate, when corrected for prescription utilisation, is similar to other statins following initial approval.",

Lipid-altering drugs are likely to to be a fast-developing area for novel treatments as possible synergies exist between new and established compounds for the treatment of atherosclerosis. New agents will have to show significant advantage in tolerability or efficacy over existing agents and have the potential to be used in combination therapy as is well established for bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid or fibrates and statins. Any new drugs will also have to be assessed in clinical end-point trials against current compounds with proven outcome benefits.", 
    "60": "(1) Simvastatin and pravastatin are the drugs of choice for secondary or primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Both these statins have proven clinical efficacy. If statin therapy is inadequate, the dose can be increased or a drug combination can be tried, while keeping a lookout for adverse effects. (2) Ezetimibe is a cholesterol-lowering drug that is said to inhibit intestinal absorption of cholesterol and related phytosterols, while not affecting the uptake of other nutrients (unlike resins). (3) The clinical evaluation dossier contains no data from trials with relevant morbidity or mortality endpoints. Primary and secondary prevention were not studied separately. (4) In patients with hypercholesterolaemia, two placebo-controlled trials show that ezetimibe reduces total cholesterol concentration (by about 13%), and LDL-cholesterol (by about 18%). Its effects on HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels are at best moderate. It is not known whether these effects reduce mortality or prevent cardiovascular events. (5) Four trials tested initial combination therapy with a statin plus ezetimibe, in comparison with statin alone and ezetimibe alone. They showed an additive effect of the two drugs on LDL-cholesterol levels. Ezetimibe alone was no better than statin monotherapy. (6) A trial in patients who did not respond adequately to statin monotherapy showed that adding ezetimibe increased the number of patients whose LDL cholesterol level fell to a predetermined cutoff point. But the clinical relevance of this result is unknown. Two other trials have shown that, in this setting, adding ezetimibe to simvastatin or to atorvastatin increased the number of patients who reached the LDL-cholesterol cutoff relative to continued statin monotherapy at a higher dose. (7) In homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, high-dose statin and ezetimibe combination therapy reduced the LDL-cholesterol more effectively than high-dose statin alone. It is not known whether adding ezetimibe is more effective than LDL apheresis alone. (8) In homozygous familial sitosterolaemia, a very rare disorder due to increased absorption of dietary cholesterol and phytosterols, a placebo-controlled trial showed that ezetimibe had no significant impact on the absolute sitosterol value. (9) Comparative trials reported no major adverse effects associated with ezetimibe, but their duration (maximum three months) is too short to rule out long-term adverse effects. Initial pharmacovigilance reports cases of muscular and hepatic adverse effects. (10) In practice, ezetimibe has discernible effects in the laboratory. But the absence of data based on clinical endpoints and trials versus other cholesterol-lowering drugs with proven clinical benefits, together with the lack of information on possible long-term adverse effects, means ezetimibe must be evaluated more thoroughly before it can be recommended for routine use.", 
    "61": "Several lines of evidence indicate that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exert anti-atherogenic effects in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we determined the effect of members of the above classes of drugs on the uptake of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by U937 cells (human monocytic cell line), a key event in the progression of atherosclerosis. U937 cells were treated with drugs and subsequently the uptake of fluorescent acetylated LDL was assessed by flow cytometry. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, atorvastatin and simvastatin (1-30 mumol/l), but not calcium channel blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, inhibited the uptake of modified LDL by monocytes. Therefore, atorvastatin and simvastatin may slow down the progression of atherosclerosis by inhibiting the formation of foam cells.",

Inhibition studies did not show the same trend as the transport studies with SV and AVA inhibiting P-gp (IC50 -25-50 microM) but SVA not showing any inhibition of P-gp.",

A bioequivalence study was carried out in 24 healthy male volunteers who received four 10 mg tablets of the test formulation (Kolestor) and the same dose of the originator product. The trial was performed according to an open, crossover design with a wash-out period of 7 days in one study center. Blood samples were taken up to 48 h post dose, the plasma was separated and the concentrations of atorvastatin were determined by HPLC-MS-MS method. The mean Cmax were 16.37 ng/mL and 17.05 ng/mL, while the mean AUC0-t were 103.61 ng x h/mL and 102.55 ng x h/mL for the test and reference formulations, respectively. The mean AUC0-inf were 118.10 ng x h/mL and 117.13 ng x h/mL for the test and reference formulations, respectively. The median tmax was 0.67 h for both the test tablet and the reference product. The mean t(1/2 el) was 11.85 h for the test formulation and 13.28 h for the reference formulation. No significant differences of pharmacokinetic parameters between the two studied formulations were found. The 90% confidence intervals for the primary target parameters, intra-individual ratios of AUC0-t and Cmax of atorvastatin, were between 0.85 and 1.05 (AUC0-t) and between 0.84 and 1.23 (Cmax), respectively, and thus within the acceptance ranges. Concerning the secondary parameter tmax the 90% confidence interval for the intra-individual differences was between -0.17 and 0.17 h. In the light of the present study it can be concluded that the two evaluated atorvastatin formulations, i.e. test formulation of atorvastatin and reference preparation are bioequivalent in terms of the rate and extent of absorption.",

    "75": "A novel and unique approach was used for retention modelling in the separation of simvastatin and six impurities by liquid chromatographic using a microemulsion as mobile phase. A microemulsion is a modification of a micellar system where a lipophilic organic solvent is dissolved in the micelles; for that reason, microemulsions are usually treated as solvent-modified micellar solutions. When microemulsions are used as eluents in HPLC separations, solutes partition between the charged oil droplets and the aqueous buffer phase. The complexity of the composition of the microemulsion permits extensive manipulations to be made during method development in order to achieve acceptable resolution of such a complex mixture of substances. In order to avoid a laborious \"trial and error\" procedure, a 2(3) full factorial design was applied for choosing an optimal microemulsion composition to obtain good separation in a reasonable run time. Organic solvent, sodium dodecyl sulphate, and n-butanol content were varied within defined experimental domain. Optimal conditions for the separation of simvastatin and its six impurities were obtained using an X Terra 50 x 4.6 mm, 3.5 microm particle size column at 30 degrees C. The mobile phase consisted of 0.9% w/w of diisopropyl ether, 2.2% w/w of sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), 7.0% w/w of co-surfactant such as n-butanol, and 89.9% w/w of aqueous 25 mM disodium phosphate pH 7.0.",

    "83": "In the past 15 years statins have gained recognition as one of the successful drugs in cardiovascular therapy and are now regarded as important as the beta blocking agents and ACE inhibitors. Since the publication of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study in 1994, the clinical application of statins has become increasingly widespread. Numerous large-scale clinical end-point trials have demonstrated that statin therapy reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Their beneficial therapeutic effects, besides their lipid lowering role, have been attributed to their non-lipid modifying ability, called the pleiotropic effect. The clinical consequences of the latter are not well understood, simply because differentiating between their lipid modifying and pleiotropic effects is not possible in vivo. In this article the authors summarize the evidence of the pleiotropic effects based on results of the latest in vitro experiments. They describe the influence of statins on endothelial dysfunction and thrombus formation, their anti-inflammatory, plaque-stabilizing and antioxidant effects, as well as their CRP and angiogenesis modifying non-lipid effects. The authors further discuss the effects of these drugs on tumors, osteoporosis and dementia. Although all members of the statin family inhibit the same enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase), their various pharmacokinetic properties, and tissue selectivity (lipophilicity and hydrophilicity) are responsible for their different pleiotropic effects.", 
    "84": "A mutation of the CD36 gene that encodes a fatty acid transporter has been reported to play a role in insulin resistance in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Statins reduce circulating cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. The objective of this study was to determine the role of CD36 and the significance of statin therapy in insulin-resistance syndromes. We determined the isometric relaxation induced by acetylcholine or lecithinized superoxide dismutase (SOD) in aortas obtained from Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, a model of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia, and normal control (Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka; LETO) rats with or without cerivastatin treatment. We also determined the effect of cerivastatin on aortic expression of CD36 and PPARgamma. The CD36 genotype and microsatellite markers on chromosome 4 were also determined. The relaxation induced by acetylcholine and lecithinized SOD were attenuated in OLETF rats but restored by a low dose of cerivastatin without significant changes in serum cholesterol. These relaxations were also restored by a high dose of cerivastatin with significant reductions in serum cholesterol and triglyceride. Cerivastatin increased the aortic expression of CD36 and PPARgamma mRNA in both LETO and OLETF rats. However, the basal level of CD36 mRNA and the increase in CD36 mRNA in response to cerivastatin were significantly lower in OLETF rats than in LETO rats. Although the abnormal CD36 genotype reported in SHR was not found in OLETF rats, the microsatellite markers of D4Rat151 and D4Rat115 differed between OLETF and LETO rats. In conclusion, insulin resistance in OLETF rats may be partially due to an altered expression of CD36. Increased aortic expression of CD36 in response to cerivastatin could explain the reduction in serum triglyceride concentrations with statin therapy and may have pronounced beneficial effects in insulin-resistance syndromes.",

Moreover, mRNA expression levels of both CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) alpha and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, the key adipogenic transcription factors, were markedly decreased by RE. RE also inhibited the expression of PPARgamma at protein levels. RE decreased significantly gene expression of adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (aP2) and leptin, which are adipogenic marker proteins and C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma target genes.

The fasting respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of post-myositis patients off statins was abnormally increased (P=0.00001) as was their S1-slope (P=0.023). Controls demonstrated a significant increase in their RER while taking statins consistent with decreased lipid oxidation (P <0.00001). These findings suggest that abnormal lipid oxidation in certain patients may predispose them to the myotoxicity caused by lipid-lowering therapies.",

    "106": "Two lipid-lowering regimens were taken for 8 weeks. One set of patients (n=45, 26 men, average 50 +/- 2 years of age) was subjected to atorvastatin treatment (20-40 mg/day), plus diet recommendation. Another set of patients (n=23, 12 men, average 53 +/- 3 years of age) went through diet recommendation alone. Both groups were recommended to perform standard physical activity. Plasma samples were collected after overnight fasting at baseline and after 8 weeks for ELISA. The use of atorvastatin when compared to diet alone, resulted in significant (P <0.0001) reductions for: LDL-cholesterol (39.9% versus 4.4%), TNF (21.4% versus 2.9%), IL-6 (22.1% versus 2.0%), IL-1 (16.4% versus 2.7%) and sICAM-1 (9.6% versus 0.1%), respectively. The percentage of patients with CRP levels >3 mg/dL in the atorvastatin group fell from 25.0 to 6.7% (P <0.0001) while in the diet group the reduction was not significant.", 
    "107": "In hypercholesterolemic patients, atorvastatin, compared to diet alone resulted in significant reductions in levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1 and IL-6) as well as in sICAM-1 and CRP. Thus, statin-induced inhibition of inflammatory markers may play an important role in the pharmacological and clinical effects of statins seen in cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "108": "Because the mechanisms of the biological effects of statin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapies differ, we studied the vascular responses to these therapies in hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary artery disease. We administered simvastatin 20 mg and placebo or ramipril 10 mg daily during 2 months with washout 2 months to 32 hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary artery disease. This study was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover in design. Simvastatin alone or combined with ramipril significantly changed lipoproteins, and improved the percent flow-mediated dilator response to hyperemia relative to baseline measurements by 33 +/- 6% and by 50 +/- 14%, respectively (both P <0.001) and reduced plasma levels of nitrate relative to baseline measurements (P=0.413 and 0.037, respectively), the plasma MDA levels relative to baseline measurements by 8 +/- 8% and by 18 +/- 9% (P=0.039 and P <0.001, respectively) and MCP-1 relative to baseline measurements by 7 +/- 4% and by 13 +/- 3%, respectively (P=0.019 and P <0.001, respectively), and CRP from 0.22 to 0.14 mg/dl and from 0.22 to 0.15 mg/dl, respectively (P=0.124 and 0.002, respectively), and PAI-1 antigen relative to baseline measurements (P=0.690 and 0.018, respectively). However, simvastatin combined with ramipril changed to greater but statistically insignificant extent the percent flow-mediated dilator response to hyperemia and plasma levels of nitrate, MDA, MCP-1, and PAI-1 antigen than simvastatin alone. Simvastatin alone or combined with ramipril showed significant beneficial effects on endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic patients with coronary artery disease. However, simvastatin combined with ramipril did not significantly change, compared with simvastatin alone.",

Ninety-four women aged 50-65 were selected. All have received dietary counseling (4 weeks), placebo (4 weeks), and drug therapy (12 weeks): 17-beta estradiol 2mg/day (E) (n=17); E + norethisterone acetate 1mg/day (P) (n=18); Atorvastatin 10mg/day (A) (n=20); E + A (n=21) and E + P + A (n=18). All treatment modalities have significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC) (E=8.8%, E + P=10.1%, A=27.9%, A + E=29.4% and E + P + A=35.7%) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) levels (E + P + A=46.6%, E + A=45.9%, A=40.2%, E=20.3%, and E + P=12.1%). As concerns HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), Groups E and E + A had increases of 15.5% and 13.1%, respectively. The addition of a progesterone compound reduced its concentration (Group E + P=-9.1%, and Group E + P + A=-9.5%). By random, approximately half of the patients in each group were designated to the endothelial function evaluation (brachial artery ultrasound). We observed that in Group A (n=10), in Group E (n=10) and with the association (Group E + A) (n=7), there was a significant increase in the flow-mediated vasodilatation as compared to basal measurements. The addition of a progestin has annulled these benefits.",

This study has two aims: (1) to compare select inflammatory mediators in non-smoking, normoglycemic male subjects with and without the atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia (ADL), and (2) to determine the effects of statin therapy on select inflammatory mediators. ADL subjects had higher levels of insulin (16.7 +/- 7.5 versus 11.6 +/- 5.9 microIU/mL, P=0.008), soluble TNF receptor superfamily 1B (sTNFRSF1B) (3.3 +/- 0.7 versus 2.7 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, P=0.005), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (2.6 +/- 2.2 versus 1.3 +/- 1.8 pg/mL, P=0.006) as compared to those of the non-ADL subjects. After adjustment for age, sTNFRSF1B (P=0.003) was more predictive of ADL than high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (P=0.047). Statin therapy did not change sTNFRSF1B, TNF-alpha, IL-6, hs-CRP, whereas soluble TNF receptor superfamily 1A (sTNFRSF1A) increased slightly (P=0.048). A high level of sTNFRSF1B is a strong marker of the pro-inflammatory state in this sample of male ADL subjects.", 
    "112": "The lipid-lowering drugs, statins, induce apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells. Here we investigated the apoptotic effect of the lipophilic statin, simvastatin, in C6 glioma cells and the underlying effects on intracellular signal transduction. Simvastatin inhibited cell proliferation totally after 20h of treatment as shown by the decrease in proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression in the nucleus. Subsequently, simvastatin caused apoptotic cell death by shrinkage of cytoplasm and condensation of chromatin, and DNA fragmentation. The features of apoptosis were visible only after 48 h of treatment, possibly reflecting a requirement for cell commitment to growth arrest. In immunocytochemical and immunoblotting experiments we have shown that simvastatin markedly increased the phosphorylation of ATF-2 and c-jun in the nucleus of the C6 glioma cells at early time points which was preserved even 24 h after treatment. In contrast, activities of protein kinases Erk1/2 and AKT in the cell survival pathway remained unchanged throughout the treatment. Selective inhibitor of JNK, but not p38 kinase, reduced simvastatin-induced cell death and ATF-2 and c-jun phosphorylation suggesting that JNK-dependent activation of ATF-2 and c-jun may play an important role in simvastatin-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in C6 glioma cells. These observations suggest that statins may have clinical significance in the prevention of glial tumors beyond their cholesterol-lowering effect and JNK may be a rational target for sensitizing glioma cells to chemotherapeutic agents.",

Additionally, DOPPS has reported on the associations between vascular access outcomes and related medications.", 
    "115": "Prescription of statins varied widely across countries, with the highest use in the United States. Patients prescribed statins had lower risk of cardiac and noncardiac causes of mortality than those who were not prescribed statins. DOPPS data also show that statins are underprescribed relative to recent Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. No guidelines have been established for analgesic use, but high pain levels self-reported by hemodialysis patients suggest opportunities for improved pain management strategies. Guidelines for analgesic use in dialysis patients may help balance improved quality of life against potential side effects of analgesics. Medical and patient questionnaires show that depression in hemodialysis patients is common, frequently underdiagnosed, usually untreated, and associated with increased rates of mortality and hospitalization. Calcium channel blockers were associated with improved primary graft patency, aspirin with improved secondary graft patency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with improved secondary fistula patency. All 3 medications were associated with significantly decreased relative risk for access failure. There is large country variation in multivitamin use, with significantly higher use in the United States compared with Europe and Japan. Patients taking multivitamins had lower mortality risk than patients not taking multivitamins.",

    "117": "Strain improvement through random mutagenesis, screening and selection has provided us with spontaneous mutants which could produce more ML-236B than the original isolate, Penicillium citrinum SANK18767. The objective of the present study is to clarify how a high-producing mutant No. 41520 acquired the ability to produce 500 times more ML-236B than the original isolate on a molecular basis. Southern blot analysis and sequence comparison revealed that amplification of the ML-236B biosynthetic gene cluster and alteration of nucleotides within the loci had not occurred in the genome of No. 41520. On the other hand, a differential hybridization and Northern blot analysis showed that expression levels of the nine biosynthetic genes mlcA to mlcH and mlcR in No. 41520 increased greatly as compared to those in the original isolate. These data suggested that the increase in ML-236B production was partly due to increased expression of genes involved in ML-236B biosynthesis. Morphological differences and higher consumption of carbon source would also affect ML-236B production in No. 41520. Functional analysis revealed that a gene, orf1 next to mlcR, was not involved in the ML-236B biosynthesis, but it was involved in the transcriptional activation of genes along with the ML-236B gene cluster. Titer enhanced mutations might have occurred in the regulation system for transcription activation of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes in the mutants of P. citrinum.", 
    "118": "The human scavenger receptor class B type I (Cla-1) plays a key role in cellular cholesterol movement in facilitating transport of cholesterol between cells and lipoproteins. Indirect evidence has suggested that Cla-1 gene expression is under the feedback control of cellular cholesterol content. To define the molecular mechanisms underlying such putative regulation, we evaluated whether Cla-1 is a target gene of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factor family.", 
    "119": "Transient transfections demonstrated that SREBP factors induce Cla-1 promoter activity and that SREBP-2 is a more potent inducer than the SREBP-1a isoform. The 5'-deletion analysis of 3 kb of the 5'-flanking sequence of the Cla-1 gene, combined with site-directed mutagenesis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, allowed identification of a unique sterol responsive element. SREBP-mediated Cla-1 regulation was confirmed in stably transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the active form of SREBP-2 at incremental levels. In these cell lines, Cla-1 mRNA and protein levels were increased in direct proportion to the level of SREBP-2 expression.",

    "121": "Epidemiological studies showed that hypercholesterolemia is associated with higher left ventricular mass. Endothelin signaling is activated in hyperlipidemic animals and may contribute to progressive ventricular hypertrophy. Simvastatin has been shown to inhibit endothelin-1. However, the behavior of simvastatin on ventricular hypertrophy in hyperlipidemic animals is not well understood. In this study, we evaluated the hemodynamic, biochemical, and morphological responses to simvastatin in cholesterol-fed (1%) rabbits. The left ventricular weight increased 8 wk after cholesterol feeding compared with that in normocholesterolemic rabbits. Simvastatin at a clinical therapeutic dose (1.2 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) significantly decreased left ventricular weight by 14% and left ventricular myocyte sizes by 14% as isolated by enzymatic dissociation. Hypercholesterolemia upregulated ventricular preproendothelin-1 mRNA as assessed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and elevated production of cardiac endothelin-1 concentration. The increased endothelin-1 responses can be inhibited after simvastatin administration. Left ventricular mass indexed by body weight positively correlated with tissue endothelin-1 levels (P = 0.0003). In Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, hyperlipidemia led to significant QT prolongation compared with normocholesterolemia, which can be reversed by administering simvastatin. In contrast, simvastatin-induced beneficial effects were reversed by the addition of mevalonate. The addition of bosentan, a nonspecific endothelin receptor blocker, improved the response in hypercholesterolemic rabbits and did not have additional beneficial effects in simvastatin-treated rabbits. The results of the present study suggest that the antihypertropic and electrocardiographic effects of simvastatin at a clinical therapeutic dose are mediated through inhibition of tissue endothelin-1 expression, which is linked to mevalonate metabolism, and result in an amelioration of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy development by an atherogenic diet.",

    "123": "We used MOLT-4 cells, which do not express estrogen receptors and require important amounts of cholesterol for proliferation. We firstly confirmed that tamoxifen reduced cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting sterol Delta(8,7)-isomerase and Delta(24)-reductase activities, which resulted in the accumulation of zymosterol. In cells incubated in the presence of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (120 microg cholesterol/ml), tamoxifen stimulated LDL receptor activity and expression in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanineperchlorate (DiI)-labeled LDL uptake, LDL receptor expression on the cell surface and LDL receptor mRNA levels. Furthermore, tamoxifen, but not lovastatin, inhibited the egress of LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes, as ascertained by filipin staining in both MOLT-4 and HepG2 cells. When studied in combination, especially at relatively high LDL concentrations in the medium, tamoxifen and lovastatin stimulated LDL receptor activity synergistically, which is attributed to the different mechanism of action these drugs exhibit.", 
    "124": "The present study demonstrates the stimulation of the LDL receptor by tamoxifen. These results explain the long-known hypolipidemic effect of tamoxifen and support its use, or that of other intracellular cholesterol trafficking inhibitors, in combination with statins for the reduction of plasma LDL cholesterol levels.",

Statins may exert vascular protective effects, independent of the lowering of plasma cholesterol levels. We investigated the impact of statins on mRNA expression of the age-suppressor gene, klotho in mIMCD3 cells.", 
    "126": "Klotho mRNA levels were evaluated with real-time RT-PCR. Atorvastatin and pitavastatin increased the expression of klotho mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. This stimulatory effect was abolished by the addition of mevalonate, GGPP and FPP, essential molecules for isoprenylation of the small GTPase Rho. As was the case with the statin treatment, inhibition of Rho-kinase by Y27632 up-regulated klotho mRNA. In contrast to the statin treatment, stimulation with angiotensin II down-regulated klotho mRNA expression without obvious morphological changes. Furthermore, pretreatment with atorvastatin blunted the angiotensin II-induced response and ameliorated the decrease in klotho mRNA expression towards basal levels. RhoA activity was further evaluated by detection of its translocation. Angiotensin II activated RhoA, whereas statins potently inactivated RhoA and blocked RhoA activation by angiotensin II.",

Although these observations are important and have resulted in the adoption of standard of care approaches to the management of CVD risk, they do not tell the whole story. When reviewing these landmark trials it is clear that on average two thirds of events are not prevented. This leads to the evaluation of risk beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This review focuses on the association of low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and increased CVD risk, the published trials that study the effect of raising HDL cholesterol on CVD outcomes, and the novel approaches toward HDL cholesterol raising that are on the horizon.", 
    "129": "Ezetimibe is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved novel drug that targets the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine. The identification of this drug has also led to the elucidation of the dietary cholesterol receptor. Ezetimibe is efficacious as a plasma cholesterol-lowering agent as monotherapy, but its greatest utility seems to be as a combination with a low-dose statin, where it results in cholesterol lowering that is equivalent to using maximum-dose statins. It has a very favorable side-effect profile, as well as a lack of drug-drug interactions. In addition, it prevents the absorption of noncholesterol sterols, such as plant sterols. In clinical studies, it has been shown to be highly efficacious in lowering plant sterols in a rare genetic disorder, sitosterolemia. Both the disease, as well as this therapeutic agent, have led to the concept that ezetimibe may be also useful in dissecting the role of these noncholesterol sterols in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.", 
    "130": "Over the past two decades, cholesterol-lowering drugs have proven to be effective and have been found to significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, diet and lifestyle factors are still recognized as the first line of intervention for CHD risk reduction by the National Cholesterol Education Program and the American Heart Association, which now advocate use of viscous fibers and plant sterols, and soy protein and nuts, respectively. In a series of metabolically controlled studies, we have combined these four cholesterol-lowering dietary components in the same diet (ie, a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods) in an attempt to maximize low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. We have found that the portfolio diet reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by approximately 30% and produced clinically significant reductions in CHD risk. These reductions were the same as found with a starting dose of a first-generation statin drug.",

Sequencing analysis of the LDLR and apoB-100 genes were negative, whilst a splice acceptor mutation in intron 1 (IVS 1 -1G>C) was detected in the ARH gene. The patient was homozygous for the mutation, whilst the parents were heterozygous. These findings were in agreement with a diagnosis of ARH.", 
    "134": "Monthly LDL apheresis and atorvastatin 120 mg daily reduced LDL cholesterol preapheresis level to 4.8 mmol L(-1). When ezetimibe was given 10 mg day(-1) in combination with rosuvastatin 80 mg day(-1), LDL cholesterol was further lowered to 1.6 mmol L(-1), which made apheresis unnecessary. Cutaneous and tendon xanthomas disappeared completely and the intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries decreased. At age 23 he developed a small myocardial infarction.", 
    "135": "ARH should be considered in cases of severe hypercholesterolaemia with a pattern of recessive inheritance. Combination therapy with high-dose statin and ezetimibe seems to be the treatment of choice in ARH and may reduce or eliminate the need for LDL apheresis treatment.",

T lymphocytes were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers, cell proliferation and the activation markers expression were examined by flow cytometric analysis. Cytokine secretion was assayed by ELISA. LDH-release assay was used to detect activity of killer cells. NFAT activation was evaluated by TransAM ELISA kit. Results were as following. (1) Whereas no modification in CD25 expression was seen, fluvastatin at 5 microM caused a lower level of CD69 expression, accompanied by an essential suppression on proliferation, IL-2 production and cytotoxicity development in PHA-stimulated T cells. However, the level of secreted IL-10 had no change, and the level of IL-4 even experienced a significant increase. (2) Combined with cyclosporine A (CsA), fluvastatin would further repress CD69 expression, cells proliferation and activity of killer cells, meanwhile significantly induced the secretion of IL-4 and IL-10. (3) Fluvastatin treatment also resulted in a strong inhibition of NFAT activation. In conclusion, partly involving the blockage of activation of NFAT, fluvastatin exhibited an immunosuppressive effect in vitro.",

In addition, recent evidence from trials among patients with vascular disease or diabetes suggests that statin therapy may delay progressive loss of renal function. However, there remains substantial uncertainty regarding the effects of statin therapy among patients with established chronic kidney disease (pre-dialysis or dialysis patients). In particular, there does not appear to be a strongly positive relationship between blood cholesterol and cardiovascular events in such patients. This may be because uraemic cardiomyopathy and arteriosclerosis, which cause the majority of these events in chronic kidney disease patients, do not depend strongly on blood cholesterol.",

One potentially modifiable risk factor for CVD in patients with CKD is dyslipidemia. In the current manuscript we review observational and trial data assessing dyslipidemia and its treatment in this patient population.", 
    "141": "Observational studies have noted a \"reverse epidemiology\" in patients with CKD such that low total cholesterol levels are associated with a higher mortality rate. The complex lipid profile of patients with CKD also raises questions as to whether lipid-lowering therapy will be beneficial in this patient population. Although there are only a few trials assessing the relationship between lipid-lowering therapy and CVD outcomes in CKD patients, many lipid-lowering medications are both safe and effective. In addition, there is suggestive evidence that statin therapy, in particular, also may reduce inflammation and slow the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients during the earlier stages of CKD.", 
    "142": "Because of the high rate of CVD in patients with CKD and the overall safety of most medical therapies for dyslipidemia in CKD, current guidelines from the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative recommend aggressive therapy of dyslipidemia. These guidelines do, however, acknowledge the paucity of trial data in this patient population. There are 3 ongoing randomized controlled trials that are assessing the effect of statin therapy on CVD outcomes. These studies will hopefully provide definitive answers as to the appropriate treatment of dyslipidemia in CKD.", 
    "143": "The treatment of coronary artery disease has reached many milestones - from balloon angioplasty to drug-eluting stents. The last decade witnessed the revolution of bare metal stents with new designs, alloys and strut thicknesses. Yet restenosis, the aphorismic 'Achilles heel', remains to be conquered. The restenosis rates with balloon angioplasty alone are 30-40% and are reduced to 20-30% with stents. Although intravascular brachytherapy proved to be a durable and safely used technique to treat in-stent restenosis, clinical event rates were not reduced to single digits.Drug-eluting stents are showing positive results in this direction, but it is too early to predict their efficacy in various subsets of lesions. With the increased usage of these stents, there are reports of problems such as late stent malapposition, subacute and late thromboses, and aneurysm formations due to the vessel toxicity associated with this method of treatment. Furthermore, when multivessel stenting is considered, the cost of drug-eluting stents is a significant problem given the fact that these are no longer 'zero restenosis' devices. There is a definite need for a simple, safe and durable solution to restenosis. Oral agents are an alternative delivery strategy that can target multiple coronary lesions, which are targets for catheter-based revascularisation with any approved metal stent and with potentially lower cost. Although oral agents have been an interesting option to treat restenosis and several agents have been tested in trials since the 1980s, the results were disappointing. The development of devices such as intravascular ultrasound has led to a greater understanding of restenosis mechanisms, and the focus on pathophysiological mechanisms, which centred mainly on platelets, growth factors and lipids, has changed to inflammation, endothelium and smooth muscle cell proliferation.Accordingly, the targets of pharmaceutical agents have shifted from platelets to cell cycle inhibition, smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, synthesis of extra cellular matrix, and inflammatory mediators. Initial encouraging results with oral drugs such as cilostazol, sirolimus (rapamycin) and thiazolidinediones indicate a definite place for this strategy to reduce restenosis. A desirable oral agent would be anti-inflammatory, inhibit smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, promote endothelial growth, and be well tolerated and free from significant adverse effects. It may be useful to start with a high loading dose before stent implantation and then follow with a short-term lower maintenance dose. Future trials should be aimed at finding an ideal agent, effective loading dose, maintenance dose and optimum duration of therapy.",

At baseline, 24% of the patients were receiving statin therapy, increasing to 61% at 2 years. There were no significant changes in creatinine phosphokinase, trough cyclosporine levels, or total cyclosporine dose. Alkaline phosphatase levels increased (166.1+/-3.6-184.6+/-6.1 mmol/L, P=0.009), but remained within the normal clinical range; creatinine clearance increased (58.6+/-1.0-61.0+/-1.2 mL/min, P=0.05). For patients followed concurrently in two units without the algorithm, serum cholesterol measurements decreased from 5.57 mmol/L and 5.34 mmol/L to 5.31 mmol/L and 5.27 mmol/L, respectively (P=0.05), both higher than that achieved contemporaneously at St. James's.

We tested the ability of statins to diminish HIV-1 replication, based on the idea that these compounds have been shown to block ICAM-1-LFA-1 interactions. Our data indicate that statins diminish HIV-1 attachment to target cells by suppressing ICAM-1-LFA-1 interactions.

    "152": "Thirty-one patients completed the study. The proportion of patients at the LDL-C goal was not statistically different between enrollment and week 12 (87% vs 68%; p = 0.068). The mean LDL-C value +/- SD at weeks 6 and 12 increased compared with enrollment (112 +/-20, 111 +/-17, and 97 +/- 17 mg/dL, respectively; p < 0.001). Three (10%) patients reported nonadherence to the twice-weekly regimen. Seventeen (55%) patients reported that both regimens were equally convenient or preferred the twice-weekly regimen. Estimated cost-savings at our institution associated with this regimen would be $32 000 per 1000 patients per year.", 
    "153": "The twice-weekly regimen safely maintained most of the patients at their LDL-C goal level, and over half the patients found this regimen to be the same or easier to follow than a daily regimen. Large outcome studies evaluating this approach are needed.", 
    "154": "As part of the acute phase reaction, lipid metabolism is significantly altered in patients with unstable coronary syndromes. The clinical relevance and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are discussed in this article. Cholesterol reduction takes place in the first hours of an acute coronary event; thus, plasma levels determined at this point should be interpreted with caution. This reduction may be just a consequence of the inflammatory response, or it may be also related to an increase in cellular uptake of cholesterol for tissue repair and hormonal synthesis. A synergistic effect between this predisposition to cholesterol reduction and statin therapy appears to exist during acute coronary syndromes. Triglyceride changes are variable during acute coronary syndromes, and recent data indicate that the pattern of triglyceride variation is a potential risk marker in those patients, possibly because it reflects neurohumoral changes related to the acute phase.", 
    "155": "Since the first secondary prevention trials were published in 1998, the prospect of hormone replacement therapy to prevent atherosclerotic heart disease in postmenopausal women has changed dramatically. Early harmful effects of hormone replacement therapy and lack of beneficial effects on coronary heart disease event rates in high-risk women have challenged the beneficial results gleaned from observational studies in the past. In this article, the effects of estrogens on lipids, hemostatic parameters, inflammation, and the vascular wall are described. The discrepancies that have arisen between the previous observational studies and recent randomized clinical trials are discussed: The current available data indicate that estrogens are beneficial to healthy endothelium but are harmful once atherosclerotic disease has developed.", 
    "156": "Concept of sequence and time of appearance of various effects of statins is presented. Apart from hypolipidemic action due to inhibition of HMG CoA reductase activity statins exert multiple pleiotropic effects. Combination of these effects makes statins a unique instrument for solution of global tasks of prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis and its consequences (ischemic heart disease etc.). Manifestations of various pleiotropic effects of statins appear after different time intervals and in most cases are not related to suppression of cholesterol synthesis in the body. First 3-4 months (first level of the statin cascade) are characterized mainly by activity of pleiotropic properties aimed at restoration of endothelial function. These properties are responsible for enhanced eNOS expression, antiischemic, antithrombotic and antiatherogenic effects. During same period of time stabilization of unstable atheromas takes place. Manifestations of second level of the cascade of statin action appear after 2 years of treatment. They are represented by retardation of progression and even partial regression of atheromatosis of coronary and peripheral arteries. Third level is signified by achievement of strategic aims of therapy with statins (in 4-5 years) -- lowering of total and cardiac mortality, reduction of number of cardiac complications. Forth level of the cascade is represented by beneficial influences on nonatherogenic cardiological phenomena and comprise hypotensive, antiarrhythmic and cardiotonic effects. And finally some other important properties of statins constitute the fifth level of the therapeutic cascade. These properties are responsible for effects directed at noncardiac pathology (prevention of diabetes, dementia, including dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, fractures). Immunodepression, ability to reduce saturation of bile with cholesterol belong to this group of effects.",

    "158": "Achievement rates for the eight program goals at time of discharge were compared in all patients discharged from a university hospital-based stroke service with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke or TIA during a 1-year period after implementation of the PROTECT Program vs rates obtained from a comparable group of patients admitted to the same service during the preceding year.", 
    "159": "Demographic and medical features were comparable in the baseline and intervention cohorts for all patients with cerebral ischemia presumed due to large-vessel atherosclerosis or small-vessel disease (baseline year n = 117, intervention n = 130). Implementation rates in patients without specific contraindications increased for all four medication goals: 97 to 100% for antithrombotic agents, 68 to 97% for statins, 42 to 90% for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 14 to 70% for diuretics. Although data were not collected on baseline lifestyle instruction rates, instruction in the program's four lifestyle interventions was achieved by discharge in 100% of the intervention cohort.",

    "161": "Some, but not all, post hoc analyses have suggested that the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel are inhibited by atorvastatin. We sought to address this issue prospectively by performing serial measurements of 19 platelet characteristics using conventional aggregometry, rapid analyzers, and flow cytometry.", 
    "162": "The Interaction of Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel Study (Interaction Study) was designed for patients undergoing coronary stenting. All patients (n = 75) received 325 mg of aspirin daily for at least 1 week and 300 mg of clopidogrel immediately prior to stent implantation. They had been taking atorvastatin (n = 25), any other statin (n = 25), or no statin (n = 25) for at least 30 days prior to stenting. The main outcome measure was comparison of platelet biomarkers 4 and 24 hours after clopidogrel administration between study groups.", 
    "163": "At baseline, patients from both statin groups exhibited diminished platelet aggregation and reduced platelet expression of G-protein-coupled protease-activated thrombin receptor (PAR)-1. There were no significant differences in measured platelet characteristics among the study groups 4 and 24 hours after clopidogrel intake, with the exception of a lower collagen-induced aggregation at 24 hours and a constantly diminished expression of PAR-1 in patients treated with any statin.", 
    "164": "Statins in general, and atorvastatin in particular, do not affect the ability of clopidogrel to inhibit platelet function in patients undergoing coronary stenting. These prospective data also suggest that statins may inhibit platelets directly via yet unknown mechanism(s) possibly related to the regulation of the PAR-1 thrombin receptors.", 
    "165": "For a variety of reasons, many patients abruptly discontinue statin therapy. The present analysis was conducted to determine whether the risk of cardiovascular outcomes increases after withdrawal of statin therapy in a stable cardiac population.", 
    "166": "In the Treating to New Target (TNT) study, 2 doses of atorvastatin (10 and 80 mg once daily) are being used in a double-blind parallel-group design. Of the 18,468 patients screened for study participation, 16,619 entered a dietary lead-in/drug-washout period, and of these, 15,432 eligible participants began treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/d on an open-label basis. Of the subjects who entered the dietary lead-in/drug-washout period, 57% were receiving prior statin therapy. During the 6-week drug-washout period, there were 24 primary events (defined as coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or nonfatal stroke); throughout the subsequent 8-week open-label period, there were 31 primary events. This equated to monthly Kaplan-Meier event rates of 0.20% during washout and 0.26% in the open-label phase. Event rates were therefore similar during the 2 phases.", 
    "167": "The present analysis demonstrates that short-term discontinuation of statin therapy in stable cardiac patients apparently does not lead to a clinically important increased risk of acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "168": "There is evidence for a role of oxidant stress and inflammation in atrial fibrillation (AF). Statins have both antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. We compared the effects of simvastatin with those of antioxidant vitamins on AF promotion by atrial tachycardia in dogs.", 
    "169": "We studied dogs subjected to atrial tachypacing (ATP) at 400 bpm in the absence and presence of treatment with simvastatin, vitamin C, and combined vitamins C and E. Serial closed-chest electrophysiological studies were performed in each dog at baseline and 2, 4, and 7 days after tachypacing onset. Atrioventricular block was performed to control ventricular rate. Mean duration of induced AF was increased from 42+/-18 to 1079+/-341 seconds at terminal open-chest study after tachypacing alone (P<0.01), and atrial effective refractory period (ERP) at a cycle length of 300 ms was decreased from 117+/-5 to 76+/-6 ms (P<0.01). Tachypacing-induced ERP shortening and AF promotion were unaffected by vitamin C or vitamins C and E; however, simvastatin suppressed tachypacing-induced remodeling effects significantly, with AF duration and ERP averaging 41+/-15 seconds and 103+/-4 ms, respectively, after tachypacing with simvastatin therapy. Tachypacing downregulated L-type Ca2+-channel alpha-subunit expression (Western blot), an effect that was unaltered by antioxidant vitamins but greatly attenuated by simvastatin.",

    "171": "Statin therapy reduces adverse outcomes, with a minimal decrease in vessel stenosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) noninvasively detects atherosclerotic plaque (AP) reduction. We hypothesized that statin-induced AP regression can be monitored by MRI and detected earlier than previously reported and is significantly associated with its lipid-lowering effect.", 
    "172": "APs in thoracic aorta were measured by combined surface/transesophageal MRI in 27 patients (treated with simvastatin 20 to 80 mg daily) before and after 6 months of therapy. AP volume and luminal dimensions were measured from 6 cross sections used to construct a 2.4-cm 3D volume of the aorta that included plaque and lumen. Method reproducibility was studied in 10 patients imaged twice, 1 week apart. AP volume was reduced from 3.3+/-0.1.4 to 2.9+/-1.4 cm3 at 6 months (P<0.02), whereas luminal volume increase was less accentuated (from 12.0+/-3.9 to 12.2+/-3.7 cm3, P<0.06). LDL cholesterol decreased by 23% (from 125+/-32 to 97+/-27 mg/dL, P<0.05) in 6 months. AP regression (plaque volume/area reduction) was significantly related to LDL cholesterol reduction (P<0.02 and P<0.005, respectively), and luminal volume increase was inversely related to LDL cholesterol reduction (P<0.04). Plaque volume measurement was highly reproducible (intraclass correlation R=0.98 and variability=4.8%). Intraobserver (0.91) and interobserver (0.81) concordances were documented for plaque volume assessment.", 
    "173": "AP regression and reverse remodeling can be detected accurately by MRI 6 months after statin therapy initiation, and it is strongly associated with LDL cholesterol reduction.", 
    "174": "Statins have anti-inflammatory effects, modify endothelial function and improve peripheral insulin resistance. We hypothesized that statins influence the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus in renal transplant recipients. The records of all previously non-diabetic adults who received an allograft in Toronto between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2001 were reviewed with follow-up through December 31, 2002. All patients receiving cyclosporine or tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone were included. New-onset diabetes was diagnosed by the Canadian Diabetic Association criteria: fasting plasma glucose > or =7.0 mmol/L or 2-h postprandial glucose > or =11.1 mmol/L on more than two occasions. Statin use prior to diabetes development was recorded along with other variables. Cox proportional hazards models analyzing statin use as a time-dependent covariate were performed. Three hundred fourteen recipients met study criteria, of whom 129 received statins. New-onset diabetes incidence was 16% (n = 49). Statins (p = 0.0004, HR 0.238[0.109-0.524]) and ACE inhibitors/ARB (p = 0.01, HR 0.309[0.127-0.750]) were associated with decreased risk. Prednisone dose (p = 0.0001, HR 1.007[1.003-1.010] per 1 mg/d at 3 months), weight at transplant (p = 0.02, HR 1.022[1.003-1.042] per 1 kg), black ethnicity (p = 0.02, HR 1.230[1.023-1.480]) and age > or =45 years (p = 0.01, HR 2.226[1.162-4.261]) were associated with increased diabetes. Statin use is associated with reduced new-onset diabetes development after renal transplantation.", 
    "175": "Long-term pretreatment with statins reduces myocardial injury after acute ischemia and reperfusion by increasing the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). We hypothesized that statins may act rapidly enough to protect the myocardium from ischemia/reperfusion injury when given right at the beginning of the reperfusion period and tried to delineate the role of PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway in early eNOS activation. Activated simvastatin was given intravenously 3 minutes before starting the reperfusion after temporary coronary artery occlusion (CAO) in anaesthetized rats. Simvastatin significantly increased myocardial PI 3-kinase activity, AktSer473, and eNOSSer1177 phosphorylation and reduced infarct size by 42%. Infarct size reduction as well as activation of PI 3-kinase/Akt/eNOS pathway were not observed in rats co-treated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Contribution of eNOS was further delineated using the NOS inhibitor L-NAME, which could completely block cardioprotection by the statin. In summary, simvastatin acutely reduces the extent of myocardial necrosis in normocholesterolemic rats in an NO- dependent manner by activating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. This is the first study demonstrating short-term cardioprotective effects of simvastatin in an in vivo model of ischemia/reperfusion.",

Twenty-three patients were enrolled, and 19 patients completed the study protocol. AGE 4 ml or the equivalent amount of placebo was given to subjects. Duration of the study was 1 year. S-allylcysteine (SAC), one of the active compound of AGE, was measured in the blood as a compliance marker.", 
    "179": "The mean change of the calcium score (volumetric method) for the AGE group (n = 9) was 7.5 +/- 9.4% over 1 year. The placebo group (n = 10) demonstrated an average increase in calcium scores of 22.2 +/- 18.5%, significantly greater than the treated cohort (P = 0.046). There were no significant differences in individual cholesterol parameters or C reactive protein between the groups. In patients randomized to AGE, there was a nonsignificant trend for improving cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein ratio (P = 0.07) and homocysteine level (P = 0.08).", 
    "180": "This small pilot study indicates the potential ability of AGE to inhibit the rate of progression of coronary calcification, as compared to placebo over 1 year. Should these findings be extended and confirmed in larger studies, garlic may prove useful for patients who are at high risk of future cardiovascular events."
