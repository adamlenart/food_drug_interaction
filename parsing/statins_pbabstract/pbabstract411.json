    "0": "The effects of a 7-day infusion with mevinolin, a potent competitive inhibitor of hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on the adrenal zona fasciculata were examined in normal and dexamethasone/ACTH-treated rats. In both groups of animals, the drug caused a lowering in plasma and intra-adrenal cholesterol concentrations, as well as a slight decrease in the blood level of corticosterone. Morphometry of zona fasciculata cells showed that specific mevinolin-induced changes (i.e. those occurring in both groups of rats and therefore not due to enhanced release of ACTH following decrease in circulating corticosterone) are severe lipid-droplet depletion and a conspicuous increase in smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and peroxisomes. The hypothesis is discussed that these morphological changes express a compensatory response of zona fasciculata cells to counteract the mevinolin-induced inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in both liver and adrenal cortex.", 
    "1": "Previous studies have established that under normal conditions, adrenal HMG-CoA reductase activity is higher in hamsters than in rats and humans. The hamster reductase activity follows a diurnal rhythm corresponding to that of plasma ACTH and glucocorticoids [Endocrinology 107 (1980) 215] but not to that of aldosterone. ACTH treatments to hamsters increased reductase activity after a latency of 60 min; this enhancement was prevented by cycloheximide [J. steroid Biochem. 24 (1986) 325]. Immunotitration and immunoblotting studies confirmed that ACTH caused an increase in reductase protein synthesis. In rats, long-term (1-9 days) and short-term (3 h) treatments with ACTH also induced increase in adrenal HMG-CoA reductase activity and reductase protein. In the presence of iodoacetamide and inhibitors of proteolytic enzyme, a main specific band of enzyme was evinced in the area of 102 +/- 6 kDaMr, by Western blotting, for both hamster homogenate and microsomal preparations (Endocrinology, 120 (1987]. Similarly Mr values were found with rat adrenal preparations. The concentration of mRNA, analyzed using the c-DNA pRed-10 coding for the Chinese hamster ovary reductase, was increased in adrenals of hamsters treated with ACTH. The reductase mRNA levels also fluctuated during the day in parallel with those of reductase activity and reductase protein. In conclusion, these results indicate that ACTH and other conditions inducing a change in hamster adrenal HMG-CoA reductase activity provoke parallel changes in reductase mRNA and reductase protein content. ACTH acts on the adrenal reductase of species synthesizing large as well as small quantities of cholesterol, thus indicating the general importance of this hormonal control.", 
    "2": "A female infant, born to first cousin parents, lapsed into coma with severe metabolic acidosis on day three of life. The gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric urinary organic acid profile showed marked elevation of the leucine metabolites 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-methylglutaconic, 3-methylglutaric and 3-hydroxy-isovaleric acids. Less than 5% of the normal activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA lyase was detected in cultured skin fibroblasts. The patient's total and free carnitine was initially low but rose to normal levels after placing her on DL-carnitine (100 mg kg-1 d-1). On a diet providing 87 mg kg-1 d-1 of leucine and only 25% of total calories as fat and 2 g kg-1 d-1 protein, the concentration of the urinary organic acids fell markedly. She is now 15 months old with normal growth and development. This regimen appears effective in the early treatment of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria.", 
    "3": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase was purified to homogeneity from rat liver cytoplasm. The active enzyme is a dimer composed of identical subunits of Mr = 53,000. The amino acid composition and the NH2-terminal sequence are presented. Partial cDNA clones for the enzyme were isolated by screening of a rat liver lambda gt11 expression library with antibodies raised against the purified protein. The identity of the clones was confirmed by hybrid selection and translation. When rats were fed diets supplemented with cholesterol, cholestyramine, or cholestyramine plus mevinolin, the hepatic protein mass of cytoplasmic synthase, as determined by immunoblotting, was 25, 160, and 1100%, respectively, of the mass observed in rats fed normal chow. Comparable changes in enzyme activity were observed. Approximately 9-fold increases in both HMG-CoA synthase mRNA mass and synthase mRNA activity were observed when control diets were supplemented with cholestyramine and mevinolin. When rats were fed these two drugs and then given mevalonolactone by stomach intubation, there was a 5-fold decrease of synthase mRNA within 3 h. These results indicate that cytoplasmic synthase regulation occurs primarily at the level of mRNA. This regulation is rapid and coordinate with that observed for HMG-CoA reductase. The chromosomal localization of human HMG-CoA synthase was determined by examining a panel of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids with the rat cDNA probe. Interestingly, the synthase gene resides on human chromosome 5, which has previously been shown to contain the gene for HMG-CoA reductase. Regional mapping, performed by examination of a series of chromosome 5 deletion mutants and by in situ hybridization to human chromosomes indicates that the two genes are not tightly clustered.", 
    "4": "Monacolin M, a new specific inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis structurally related to monacolin K (mevinolin), was isolated from cultures of a strain of Monascus ruber. The structure of monacolin M was determined to be beta-hydroxybutyryl ester of monacolin J by a combination of physical techniques. It was suggested that monacolin M is derived from monacolin J via a synthetic pathway distinct from that for the synthesis of monacolin K, alpha-methylbutyryl ester of monacolin J. The inhibitory effect of monacolin M on beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase was slightly lower than that of monacolin K.", 
    "5": "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia produce no normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, and as a result, LDL accumulates in plasma, causing severe premature atherosclerosis. Two years ago, liver transplantation was performed in a child with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, restoring LDL receptor activity to about 60% of normal and reducing the LDL cholesterol level by 81%. However, the patient's lipoprotein levels remained significantly elevated for her age and sex. Treatment with lovastatin (mevinolin) one year after transplantation produced a marked improvement in the patient's lipoprotein profile. The total and LDL cholesterol levels fell 40% and 49%, respectively, to values within the normal range. The level of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol fell 41%, and the level of total triglycerides declined 28%. While lovastatin therapy decreased the production rate of LDL by 35%, it did not affect the LDL fractional clearance rate. Thus, the combination of liver transplantation and lovastatin restored total and LDL cholesterol levels to normal in this patient with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "6": "Lovastatin (mevinolin), a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of 101 patients with nonfamilial primary hypercholesterolemia. Dosages varied from 10 to 80 mg/d in single or divided doses. Patients receiving 40 mg twice a day experienced mean total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions of 32% and 39%, respectively. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels tended to rise slightly and plasma triglyceride levels were moderately decreased. Adverse effects attributable to lovastatin were infrequent and no patient was withdrawn from therapy. In this study, lovastatin was a well tolerated and effective agent for the treatment of nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "7": "S-(4-Bromo-2,3-dioxobutyl)-coenzyme A inactivates both yeast and rat liver beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. The inactivation is irreversible, complete in 15 s, and proportional to the concentration of the reagent. beta-Hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA provides protection against inactivation, whereas NADPH does not. Inactivation is attributed to reaction with an essential cysteine at the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA binding site. Experiments with other active site-directed reagents confirm the involvement of a cysteine and support the presence of an active-site histidine, but rule out the participation of arginine or serine.", 
    "8": "Cultured hepatocytes isolated from livers of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol-treated rats were used to investigate the change of lipid metabolism induced by administration of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol. Treatment with 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol caused a decrease of rat plasma lipids (free cholesterol, cholesterol ester, triacylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine). No difference in the ability of urea nitrogen synthesis could be demonstrated between cultured hepatocytes isolated from livers of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol-treated rats and propylene glycol-treated rats (control). Total cholesterol and cholesterol ester contents of cultured hepatocytes isolated from livers of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol-treated rats were increased in comparison with those of the control. Triacylglycerol content of cultured hepatocytes was not affected by 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol treatment. There was no difference in the composition of lipid content between liver tissues and cultured hepatocytes. These results suggest that hepatocytes isolated from livers maintain the character of livers treated with 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol or livers treated with propylene glycol. Free cholesterol and cholesterol ester synthesis from [14C]acetic acid by cultured hepatocytes isolated from livers of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol-treated rats were decreased to about 30% of the control. Triacylglycerol and polar lipid (phospholipid) synthesis from [14C]acetic acid were not affected by 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol treatment. Microsomal hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity of rat liver treated with 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol was decreased to about 50% of control. The secretions of free cholesterol, cholesterol ester, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, apolipoprotein BL and BS by cultured hepatocytes isolated from livers of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol treated rats were not decreased when compared with the control. Because lipid and apolipoprotein secretions from cultured hepatocytes treated with 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol were not decreased and cholesterol contents of liver tissues and cultured hepatocytes treated with 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol were increased and hepatic microsomal hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity was decreased by 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol treatment, it is suggested that the liver plays an important role in hypolipidemia induced by 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol by increasing the plasma lipid uptake mediated by an increased amount of lipoprotein receptors of liver membranes.", 
    "9": "Approximately 1,600 fungal strains were tested for ability to convert compactin (ML-236B) to ML-236A and Emericella unguis IFO 8087 was found to be the most active. E. unguis converted ML-236B to ML-236A with a yield of over 90%.", 
    "10": "Statin, a protein of 57,000 D, is present in the nuclei of quiescent or senescent fibroblasts (Wang, E, J cell biol 100 (1985) 545), but is absent in their young replicating counterparts. Immunohistochemical survey of a variety of tissues demonstrates that the presence of statin is a marker for cells that are no longer involved in proliferation, i.e. those cells that are terminally differentiated. Statin expression was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy in serum-starved cultures whose replication had been reinitiated by raising the serum concentration from 0.5 to 10%. Prior to serum addition, more than 85% of the cells stained positively for statin. After stimulation with serum, the expression of statin disappeared rapidly within the first 12-14 h. On the other hand, an increase in the level of DNA synthesis, signifying entry into S phase, was observed initially at 18 h after serum stimulation, and reached maximal levels 6 h later. Immunoprecipitation of statin derived from cells harvested at different intervals after serum stimulation revealed that the level of statin synthesis was reduced by 4 h and was hardly detectable at 8 h. These results demonstrate that the synthesis of statin occurs primarily when cells are in a quiescent state, and declines rapidly when cells are induced to proliferate; this decline precedes the transition from G1 to S phase.", 
    "11": "Pure glutathione reductase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyzed under anaerobic conditions the enzymatic reduction of GSSG using electrochemically reduced methyl viologen as electron donor. The new assay was completely dependent on the amount of active enzyme present, and involved the formation of 1 mol GSH per mole of reduced methyl viologen consumed. The enzyme followed a standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics; a Km = 230 microM for reduced methyl viologen and a turnover number of 969 mumol GSSG reduced per minute per micromole enzyme were determined. The enzymatic activity seemed to depend on the redox potential, showing half-maximal activity at -0.407 V. The enzyme was quite specific: the activity using reduced benzyl viologen as electron donor was just 1.5% of that obtained with reduced methyl viologen at the same concentration and potential. Glutathione reductase was totally inactivated after a brief anaerobic exposure with reduced methyl viologen in the absence of GSSG; a partial reactivation was observed following addition of glutathione disulfide. No inhibition of the methyl viologen-dependent activity was observed in the presence of 2',5'-ADP or 2'-P-5'-ADP-ribose, two NADP(H) analogs, at concentrations which drastically inhibited the NADPH-dependent activity, thus suggesting that the reduced viologen does not interact with the pyridine nucleotide-binding site.", 
    "12": "Through the use of a quantitative solution hybridization assay with 32P-labeled cDNA probes, we found that mevinolin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, elevates the level of mRNA for the low density lipoprotein receptor in livers of hamsters and rabbits. In hamsters the maximal effect (3-fold increase) occurred at 0.1% mevinolin in the diet for 10 days. The same dose produced a maximal induction (10-fold) of mRNA levels for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, and a maximal decrease (80%) in plasma cholesterol. The drug lowered the level of all cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins in plasma. In normal rabbits, mevinolin produced a 90% reduction in plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, which was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA levels. A similar induction of receptor mRNA occurred in livers of Watanabe-heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits, although the plasma cholesterol was not reduced to normal, presumably because the receptors produced by the mutant mRNA function poorly. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that mevinolin and other inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase lower plasma cholesterol levels in part by stimulating production of mRNA for the low density lipoprotein receptor in liver.", 
    "13": "The effects of synvinolin (MK-733), a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, were investigated in 43 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study. Synvinolin was given in doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 80 mg per day for 4 weeks. 8 patients received placebo. Low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol fell on average by 18% on 2.5 mg/day and 42% on 80 mg/day. The drug was as effective whether it was given once or twice daily. Serum high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol tended to increase and serum triglycerides to decrease on the higher doses. The drug was tolerated well. Except for a slight rise in alanine aminotransferase in 3 patients no objective side-effects were observed.", 
    "14": "Oral dosing of rats with cyclohexanol and methylcyclohexanols resulted in the inhibition of hepatic HMGCoA reductase. Neither cyclohexane or cyclohexane diols exerted any effects. Inhibition was not due to alcohol dehydrogenase mediated changes in redox state since 3,3',5-trimethylcyclohexanol (TMC), a non substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase, was a potent inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase. Following a single dose of TMC there was no alteration in total hepatic HMGCoA reductase activity for more than 6 hr after which the enzyme activity was depressed in a dose-dependent manner. The normal diurnal rhythm of HMGCoA reductase was reduced in amplitude following TMC administration but the phase was unaltered and the t 1/2 for activity decay following the peak of activity was unaffected. Prior to the inhibitory effect of a TMC dose becoming apparent in total HMGCoA reductase activity we found that the expressed activity of the enzyme (after isolation in F- medium to suppress endogenous protein phosphatase) was depressed by 43%. The inhibitory effect of TMC on total HMGCoA reductase activity seen 8 hr or more after dosing was reflected by inhibition of sterol synthesis in liver measured in vivo after [3H]-H2O administration.", 
    "15": "Mevinolin (MK803), a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) (Ki, 30 X 10(-9) M), depressed de novo synthesis of cholesterol in 11-day chicken embryonic cardiac cells cultured in lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS). Cardiac cells exposed to different concentrations of mevinolin for 1-3 days presented different electrophysiological and mechanical properties: The resting membrane potential, the rate of increase, and the shape of the action potential and contractile properties were changed at concentrations as low as 0.1 microM mevinolin. At a concentration of 1 microM mevinolin, the cardiac cells became quiescent and electrical stimulation induced action potentials of short duration without contraction. Isoproterenol and Bay K8644 were unable to restore excitability and contraction. Although the number of receptors for the tritiated Ca2+ channel blocker nitrendipine was the same in control and in mevinolin-treated cells, voltage-clamp data on isolated cardiac cells and 45Ca2+ flux experiments on monolayers showed that most of the slow Ca2+ channel activity was lost in mevinolin-treated cells. These results suggest that the disappearance of Ca2+ channel activity is most probably at the origin of the loss of cardiac contractility.", 
    "16": "Rat liver slices were pulse labeled for 6 min with [3H]mevalonolactone and then chased for 90 min with unlabeled mevalonolactone in order to study the mechanism of dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis. The cholesterol pathway was also monitored and served to verify the pulse-chase. Under conditions in which radioactivity in the methyl sterol fraction chased to cholesterol, radioactivity in alpha-unsaturated polyprenyl (pyro)-phosphate chased almost exclusively into dolichyl (pyro)phosphate. Lesser amounts of radioactivity appeared in alpha-unsaturated polyprenol and dolichol, and neither exhibited significant decline after 90 min of incubation. The relative rates of cholesterol versus dolichyl phosphate biosynthesis were studied in rat liver under four different nutritional conditions using labeled acetate, while the absolute rates of cholesterol synthesis were determined using 3H2O. From these determinations, the absolute rates of dolichyl phosphate synthesis were calculated. The absolute rates of cholesterol synthesis were found to vary 42-fold while the absolute rates of dolichyl phosphate synthesis were unchanged. To determine the basis for this effect, the rates of synthesis of cholesterol and dolichyl phosphate were quantitated as a function of [3H]mevalonolactone concentration. Plots of nanomoles incorporated into the two lipids were nearly parallel, yielding Km values on the order of 1 mM. In addition, increasing concentrations of mevinolin yielded parallel inhibition of incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol and dolichyl phosphate. The specific activity of squalene synthase in liver microsomes from rats having the highest rate of cholesterol synthesis was only 2-fold greater than in microsomes from rats having the lowest rate. Taken together, the results suggest that the maintenance of constant dolichyl phosphate synthesis under conditions of enhanced cholesterogenesis is not due to saturation of the dolichyl phosphate pathway by either farnesyl pyrophosphate or isopentenyl pyrophosphate but coordinate regulation of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and a reaction on the pathway from farnesyl pyrophosphate to cholesterol.", 
    "17": "Studies have demonstrated that ketoconazole and related imidazoles block gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis in humans by inhibiting several cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that cholesterol production in humans is also affected by ketoconazole. In the present experiments cultured normal human fibroblasts have been used to explore the effects of ketoconazole on cholesterol synthesis. Ketoconazole inhibited cholesterol synthesis (greater than 90% suppression in 1 hr) rapidly by blocking the conversion of methyl sterols to cholesterol. Dihydrolanosterol was the major methyl sterol which accumulated with ketoconazole. At high concentrations of ketoconazole, the conversion of squalene to methyl sterols was also inhibited. The inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was dose-dependent with an IC50 approximately 2.8 X 10(-8) M. In parallel to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, there was a reciprocal increase in methyl sterol production. The related imidazole antimycotic, clotrimazole, had similar effects, whereas the imidazole anesthetic, etomidate, had little effect on cholesterol synthesis. Confluent cells exposed to ketoconazole had a 90% fall in the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase that declined with a T1/2 approximately 3.7 hr. In conclusion, ketoconazole has multiple effects on cholesterol synthesis, directly inhibiting late steps by blocking the conversion of methyl sterols to cholesterol and indirectly suppressing total sterol synthesis via feedback inhibition by sterol intermediates of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity.", 
    "18": "We have reported that the exogenous addition of dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) enhances the colony-forming capacities of early erythroid progenitors (BFU-E), late erythroid progenitors (CFU-E), and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) in adult mouse bone marrow, and that dolichol (Dol) enhances that of only CFU-E (Int. J. Cell Cloning 3:313, 1985). Compactin (2.5-10 microM), a specific inhibitor of mevalonate biosynthesis that causes a decrease of endogenous Dol biosynthesis, inhibited colony formation of CFU-GM. Exogenous addition of Dol-P partially prevented this inhibition, but Dol and the other mevalonate metabolites, such as cholesterol, coenzyme Q10, and isopentenyladenine, could not. In addition, we have found that the colony-forming capacity of CFU-E in fetal mouse liver was not enhanced by exogenous Dol or Dol-P. But the decrease of colony formation or DNA synthesis of fetal CFU-E in the presence of compactin was prevented by the exogenous addition of Dol or Dol-P.", 
    "19": "Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, is an effective hypocholesterolemic agent in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia when given in a twice-daily regimen. The present study compares the hypocholesterolemic effects of mevinolin given in a twice-daily dosage regimen with the same total dosage given either once in the morning or once in the evening in 12 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Ten patients took a total daily dose of 40 mg of mevinolin and two took 20 mg. On the twice-daily dosage regimen, plasma concentrations of total cholesterol decreased 29.5% and 35.9% as compared with 21.4% and 26.9% with mevinolin given once in the morning and 27% and 32.2% with the drug given once in the evening. These values are all significantly different from baseline, but differences between the three treatment regimens do not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07 for the twice-daily versus once-in-the-morning dosage regimens). We conclude that once-daily administration of mevinolin, particularly in the evening, is an effective hypocholesterolemic regimen in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "20": "Purification of the oily, nonpolar fraction of high protein barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flour by high pressure liquid chromatography yielded 10 major components, two (I, II) of which were potent inhibitors of cholesterogenesis in vivo and in vitro. The addition of purified inhibitor I (2.5-20 ppm) to chick diets significantly decreased hepatic cholesterogenesis and serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and concomitantly increased lipogenic activity. The high resolution mass spectrometric analysis and measurement of different peaks of inhibitor I gave a molecular ion at m/e 424 (C29H44O2) and main peaks at m/e 205, 203, and 165 corresponding to C13H17O2, C13H15O2, and C10H13O2 moieties, respectively. which are characteristic of d-alpha-tocotrienol. This identification was confirmed against synthetic samples. The tocotrienols are widely distributed in the plant kingdom and differ from tocopherols (vitamin E) only in three double bonds in the isoprenoid chain which appear to be essential for the inhibition of cholesterogenesis.", 
    "21": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the in vitro activation of microsomal hepatic hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase by dephosphorylation is inhibited by HMG CoA or NADPH, the substrates of HMG CoA reductase (13). In the present study the effect of three competitive inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase on the activation of HMG CoA reductase was investigated. Adenosine-2'-monophospho-5'-diphosphoribose, a competitive inhibitor for the NADPH binding site, blocked the phosphatase-mediated activation of HMG CoA reductase. By contrast, neither compactin nor mevinolin, competitive inhibitors for the HMG CoA binding site, altered the activation of HMG CoA reductase. Moreover, the HMG CoA-mediated inhibition of the activation of HMG CoA reductase was not blocked even by very high concentrations of either compactin or mevinolin. These observations suggest that HMG CoA can bind to two sites on HMG CoA reductase. One site of HMG CoA binding serves as a catalytic site and is competitively blocked by compactin or mevinolin, and the second binding site is an allosteric site to which only HMG CoA is capable of binding. The binding of HMG CoA to this second site inhibits the activation of HMG CoA reductase by phosphatases.", 
    "22": "Our previous studies (Watson, J. A., Havel, C. M., Lobos, D. V., Baker, F. C., and Morrow, C. J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 14083-14091) suggested that a matabolite, distal to isopentenyl 1-pyrophospate (IPP), served as a regulatory signal for sterol-independent modulation of Kc cell 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. This report summarizes efforts to localize the potential source of the post-IPP regulatory signal molecule. We found no direct correlation between mevalonate-mediated suppression of Kc cell HMG-CoA reductase activity and the rates of [1-14C]-, [3-14C]-, [5-14C]-, or [5-3H]mevalonate incorporation into either carbon dioxide, neutral lipids, water, or water-soluble isopentenoid pyrophosphate esters. [1-14C]Mevalonate's rate of conversion to 14CO2 (a measure of total isopentenyl 1-pyrophosphate synthesis) was minimally 5-fold greater than that for neutral isopentenoid lipid synthesis (measured with either [5-3H]-, [3-14C]-, or [5-14C]mevalonate). However, [5-3H]mevalonate's rate of conversion into [3H]H2O (measure of shunted mevalonate carbon) was equivalent or greater than that measured for neutral isopentenoid lipid synthesis. [5-14C]Mevalonate radioactivity was incorporated into macromolecules and n-fatty acids. Kc cell extracts (100,000 X g supernatant fluid) readily oxidized alcohols with the following activity sequence: geraniol = nerol greater than farnesol = dimethylallyl alcohol greater than geranylgeraniol, isopentenyl alcohol, and allyl alcohol. Oxidation required NAD, and ethanol was not a substrate. We conclude that (a) Kc cells shunted a significant fraction (greater than or equal to 40%) of their post-IPP carbon to prenols for oxidative catabolism and (b) that shunted mevalonate carbon may play a significant role in the mevalonate-mediated regulation of Kc cell HMG-CoA reductase activity.", 
    "23": "Adenosine 2'-monophospho-5'-diphosphoribose (P-ADP-Rib) is a structural analog of NADPH which was reported to competitively inhibit (Kiapp = 21.7 microM) solubilized rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (Tanazawa, K., and A. Endo. 1979. Eur. J. Biochem. 98: 195-201). However, microsomal HMG-CoA reductase, which at low thiol concentrations exhibits allosteric properties, is only poorly inhibited by P-ADP-Rib (Kiapp = 550 microM at 4.5 mM GSH). Gradual shift of the microsomal reductase towards a non-allosteric form by increasing glutathione (GSH) concentrations resulted in a higher inhibition by P-ADP-Rib. Under these conditions, Ki values for P-ADP-Rib were 165 microM and 53 microM at 9 mM and 27 mM GSH, respectively. The largest change in the degree of inhibition by P-ADP-Rib was observed within the 10 mM range of GSH. By contrast, freeze-thaw solubilized HMG-CoA reductase, which does not display allosteric properties, is readily inhibited by P-ADP-Rib, even when assayed at a low concentration of GSH (Kiapp = 50 microM at 4.5 mM GSH). Assaying the solubilized reductase in the presence of increased thiol concentration results in a minor decrease in the apparent Ki for P-ADP-Rib (22 microM at 27 mM GSH). Microsomal HMG-CoA reductase is allosterically activated by various nucleotides. When activated by NADH, the enzyme is effectively inhibited by P-ADP-Rib even at a 4.5-mM GSH concentration (Kiapp = 175 microM in the presence of 300 microM NADH).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "Mevinolin, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, was used as a therapeutic adjuvant in patients with refractory familial hypercholesterolaemia for an average period of 13 months. Sustained decreases in serum cholesterol of 23 and 31 per cent were achieved by doses of 20 mg and 40 mg/day respectively in 13 heterozygotes already on cholestyramine or after partial ileal bypass. Administration of 80 mg/day to three patients undergoing plasma exchange reduced peak serum cholesterol levels by 11.5 per cent in two homozygotes and by 17 per cent in a double heterozygote for familial hypercholesterolaemia and type III hyperlipoproteinaemia. The decrease in cholesterol was largely confined to low-density lipoprotein and no significant changes occurred in serum triglyceride or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Mevinolin was well-tolerated except in one patient who developed myositic symptoms; asymptomatic, transient elevations of serum enzymes were observed in five others. Short and long Synacthen tests showed no evidence that the drug impaired adrenocortical response to ACTH. These results indicate that mevinolin provides a safe and highly effective means of reducing LDL levels in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia refractory to conventional treatment but is less useful in homozygotes.", 
    "25": "We have isolated two genes from yeast encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase [hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (NADPH); HMG-CoA reductase; EC 1.1.1.34], the rate-limiting enzyme of sterol biosynthesis. These genes, HMG1 and HMG2, were identified by hybridization to a cDNA clone encoding hamster HMG-CoA reductase. DNA sequence analysis reveals homology between the amino acid sequence of the proteins encoded by the two yeast genes and the carboxyl-terminal half of the hamster protein. Cells containing mutant alleles of both HMG1 and HMG2 are unable to undergo spore germination and vegetative growth. However, cells containing a mutant allele of either HMG1 or HMG2 are viable but are more sensitive to compactin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, than are wild-type cells. Assays of HMG-CoA reductase activity in extracts from hmg1- and hmg2- mutants indicate that HMG1 contributes at least 83% of the activity found in wild-type cells.",

The mean total serum cholesterol level decreased by 18.6% in the CS-514 group, whereas it increased by 7.4% in the placebo group and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P less than 0.01). LDL cholesterol and LDL apo B values were reduced by 22.6% and 23.2%, respectively. Serum triglyceride level did not change significantly. No clinical or laboratory abnormalities were observed.", 
    "27": "The effects of mevinolin on cytosolic acetoacetyl CoA thiolase activity were studied in wild type Chinese hamster ovary fibroblasts and in CHO cells adapted to growth in high levels of mevinolin. Acetoacetyl CoA thiolase, HMG CoA synthase and HMG CoA reductase activities were elevated in the mevinolin resistant line, KH 2.0. Thiolase activity was also increased when wild type cells were incubated for 5 days with 1 micron mevinolin. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the regulation of the first three enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is mediated at least in part via a common mechanism.", 
    "28": "1H-NMR spectroscopy has been applied to identify components in the urine of subjects with a deficiency of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase. One-dimensional spectra of samples from a pair of non-identical twins with this disorder were very similar and are probably diagnostic. The most intense signals were from singlets. Complete assignment of these major components was made possible by the use of 2-dimensional chemical shift correlated spectroscopy since several long-range couplings were detected. 2-dimensional spectroscopic techniques may therefore be of value in the identification of singlets in multicomponent systems.", 
    "29": "Fifty-one patients with familial hypercholesterolemia were treated for 2 to 4 years with probucol, cholestyramine, clofibrate and compactin in various combinations. Mean baseline serum cholesterol was 359 +/- 10 mg/dl in the heterozygote, and 582 +/- 52 mg/dl in the homozygote patients. We found that a combination of probucol, cholestyramine and compactin decreased serum cholesterol to normal or near normal in most of the heterozygote patients. In 3 severely affected heterozygote and all 8 homozygote patients, adequate cholesterol reduction was only possible with plasmapheresis plus a hypolipidemic agent. Measurement of the Achilles tendon after 12 to 16 months of treatment showed that reductions in thickness occurred in all patients taking probucol, even in a single-drug regimen, in those undergoing plasmapheresis, especially if probucol was used and in those receiving a combination of cholestyramine and compactin. Probucol was most effective in patients who experienced the greatest decreases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, whereas the cholestyramine-compactin combination worked without decreasing HDL concentrations. Combined clofibrate-cholestyramine therapy, by contrast, led to increased tendon thickness in all but 1 patient. It is believed that probucol exerts its positive effect on xanthomata regression by reducing the size of HDL particles, as was shown in this study. It has already been reported that smaller HDL particles are more active in reverse cholesterol transport. The direct peripheral action of probucol may have aided regression as well.", 
    "30": "Cholesterol transport in the plasma involves several lipoprotein families. The process is remarkably ordered and is driven vectorily by apolipoproteins, which activate appropriate enzymes or serve as recognition sites for lipoprotein receptors. Of the lipoproteins in plasma, low density lipoprotein (LDL) contains most of the cholesterol and has the greatest atherogenic potential. Its plasma concentration is determined by LDL receptor activity, which serves to regulate intracellular cholesterol concentrations. LDL receptor activity in the body is not fixed, but can be stimulated by drugs that affect hepatic cholesterol content, such as inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase or bile acid sequestrants. By stimulating LDL receptor activity, these drugs increase the fractional catabolic rate of apoLDL. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also appear to reduce the apoLDL synthetic rate. As a consequence, LDL cholesterol levels are reduced while high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels remain stable or increase. Probucol is a drug that lowers both LDL and HDL cholesterol levels. It appears to lower LDL cholesterol levels by affecting LDL structure rather than by stimulating LDL receptor activity. It has no consistent effect on LDL synthetic rates. Probucol lowers plasma HDL cholesterol levels by decreasing the synthetic rates of the major HDL apolipoproteins. The biologic significance of these probucol-induced changes in HDL metabolism is unknown.", 
    "31": "The effects of ketoconazole, a lanosterol demethylase and cytochrome P450 inhibitor, on the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34, reductase) activity and sterol biosynthesis were studied in rat intestinal epithelial cell cultures (IEC-6). Incubation of cells with 0.15-2 microM ketoconazole resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of reductase activity. As the drug concentration approached 15 microM, the reductase activity returned to control values, and at 30 microM ketoconazole, a stimulation of enzyme activity was observed. The drug had no effect on reductase activity in homogenates of IEC-6 cells. Ketoconazole (0.15-30 microM) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the incorporation of [3H] mevalonolactone into cholesterol with a concomitant accumulation of radioactivity in methyl sterols; e.g. lanosterol and 24,25-epoxylanosterol. Interestingly, the incorporation of radioactivity into polar sterols showed a biphasic response which was inversely proportional to the biphasic response of reductase activity. Thus, incorporation of [3H]mevalonolactone into polar sterols increased at low concentrations of ketoconazole (0.15-2 microM) and decreased to control values at high concentrations of the drug. Treatment of cells with ketoconazole (30 microM) and [3H]mevalonolactone followed by removal of the drug and radiolabel resulted in an inhibition of reductase activity and a redistribution of radioactivity from lanosterol and 24,25-epoxylanosterol to cholesterol and polar sterols. These results suggested that the inhibition of reductase activity at low concentrations of ketoconazole (less than 2 microM) was due to a formation of regulatory polar sterols generated from the methyl sterols. At high concentrations of ketoconazole (30 microM) where no suppression in reductase activity was observed, the conversion of exogenously added [3H]24(S),25-epoxylanosterol to polar sterols was prevented. Exogenously added 24,25-epoxylanosterol inhibited reductase activity in a dose-dependent fashion, and ketoconazole (30 microM) prevented the inhibition caused by low concentrations of epoxylanosterol. The drug, however, was unable to prevent the dose-dependent suppression of reductase activity by 25-hydroxylanosterol, a reduced form of 24,25-epoxylanosterol. These results indicated that 24,25-epoxylanosterol per se was not an inhibitor of reductase activity but could be metabolized to regulatory polar sterols through a cytochrome P-450 dependent reaction which was sensitive to ketoconazole. Treatment of cells with ketoconazole totally abolished the inhibition of reductase activity by low density lipoprotein (LDL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "32": "CS-514 is a tissue-selective inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. For the microsomal enzyme from rat liver, the mode of inhibition is competitive with respect to hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, and the Ki value is 2.3 X 10(-9) M. CS-514 also strongly inhibited the sterol synthesis from [14C]acetate in cell-free enzyme systems from rat liver and in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes; the concentrations required for 50% inhibition were 0.8 ng/ml and 2.2 ng/ml, respectively. On the other hand, the inhibition by CS-514 was much less in the cells from nonhepatic tissues such as freshly isolated rat spleen cells, and cultured mouse L cells and human skin fibroblasts. In addition, the cellular uptake of 14C-labeled CS-514 by isolated rat spleen cells or mouse L cells was less than one-tenth of that by isolated hepatocytes. These differences between hepatic and nonhepatic cells were further confirmed by the fact that CS-514 orally administered to rats inhibited sterol synthesis selectively in liver and intestine, the major sites of cholesterogenesis. CS-514 markedly reduced serum cholesterol levels in dogs, monkeys and rabbits, including Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, an animal model for familial hypercholesterolemia in man, but did not reduce those in rats and mice. In the former case, preferential lowering of atherogenic lipoproteins was observed in all of the animals tested. The biliary neutral sterols significantly decreased, whereas the amount of biliary bile acids was not affected by administration of the drug to dogs.", 
    "33": "The effect of treatment of rats with the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, mevinolin, on 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol was studied. Treatment with 0.1% mevinolin in diet for 3 days was found to have an inhibitory effect on 7 alpha-hydroxylation of cholesterol (about 35%). Treatment with cholestyramine increased 7 alpha-hydroxylation of both exogenously added and endogenous microsomal cholesterol 3-4-fold. Combined treatment with both cholestyramine and mevinolin decreased this stimulation to 2-2.5-fold. Treatment with 2% cholesterol in diet increased 7 alpha-hydroxylation of exogenous cholesterol about 2-fold and 7 alpha-hydroxylation of endogenous cholesterol about 3.5-fold. The stimulatory effect of cholesterol was reduced or abolished when 0.1% mevinolin was added to the cholesterol-containing diet. With the exception of the experiments with cholesterol in the diet, all experiments including mevinolin gave a marked stimulation (up to 60-fold) of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity under the in vitro conditions employed. The concentration of free cholesterol in the liver microsomes was not significantly changed in any of these experiments. It is concluded that there is no coupling between induction of synthesis of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase protein and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. The inhibitory effect of mevinolin on cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity under experimental conditions where most of the effect of mevinolin on hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase was abolished by treatment with cholesterol suggest that the effect of mevinolin on the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase may be independent of its effect on cholesterol synthesis. The over-all results do not favour the hypothesis that cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol availability are the most important determinants for the regulation of the cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase.", 
    "34": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in microsomes isolated from cultured lymphoid (IM-9) cells or freshly isolated human leukocytes was markedly decreased by either ascorbic acid or its oxidized derivative, dehydroascorbate. Inhibition of IM-9 leukocyte HMG-CoA reductase activity was log linear between 0.01 and 10 mM ascorbic acid (25 and 81% inhibition, respectively) and 0.1 and 10 mM dehydroascorbate (5 and 75% inhibition, respectively). Inhibition was noncompetitive with respect to HMG-CoA (Km = 10.2 microM (RS); ascorbic acid, Ki = 6.4 mM; dehydroascorbate, Ki = 15 mM) and competitive with respect to NADPH (Km = 16.3 microM; acetic acid, Ki = 6.3 mM; dehydroascorbate, Ki = 3.1 mM). Ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbate are interconverted through the free radical intermediate monodehydroascorbate. Reducing agents are required to convert dehydroascorbate to monodehydroascorbate, but prevent formation of the free radical from ascorbate. In microsomes from IM-9 cells, the reducing agent, dithiothreitol, abolished HMG-CoA reductase inhibition by ascorbate but enhanced inhibition by dehydroascorbate. In addition, the concentration of monodehydroascorbate present in ascorbate solutions was directly proportional to the degree of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition by 1.0 mM ascorbate. Fifty per cent inhibition of enzyme activity occurred at a monodehydroascorbate concentration of 14 microM. These data indicate that monodehydroascorbate mediates inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by both ascorbate and dehydroascorbate. This effect does not appear to be due to free radical-induced membrane lipid modification, however, since both ascorbate and dehydroascorbate inhibited the protease-solubilized, partially purified human liver enzyme. Since inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase occurs at physiological concentrations of ascorbic acid in the human leukocyte (0.2-1.72 mM), this vitamin may be important in the regulation of endogenous cholesterol synthesis in man.", 
    "35": "Compactin is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme that catalyses the synthesis of mevalonate. In this study we have investigated the effects of compactin on DNA replication and cell cycle progression in animal cell cultures. We have examined several different cell types for cell cycle inhibitory effects of compactin, and although we can demonstrate that compactin inhibits mevalonate synthesis in BHK cells, we have observed little or no effect on the cell cycle. Similar results were obtained using different synchronization procedures and by measuring cell cycle progression by [3H]dThd labelling of DNA and with flow cytometry. We conclude that compactin has no appreciable and general effect on DNA replication in animal cells. These results are discussed in terms of the implications for mevalonate being a universal regulator of cell cycle progression in cultured animal cells.", 
    "36": "The reduction of elevated low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations in patients with Type II hyperlipoproteinemia leads to improved cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Two agents which may be of value in treating hypercholesterolemia are mevinolin and neomycin. Since these drugs lower cholesterol levels through complementary mechanisms, we evaluated the effects of mevinolin and combined mevinolin-neomycin treatment on plasma lipoprotein concentrations in 21 type II hyperlipoproteinemic patients. Mevinolin reduced total and LDL cholesterol concentrations by 24% and 31% respectively (P less than 0.001) and 81% of the patients reduced their LDL cholesterol levels to less than 200 mg/dl. Although the addition of neomycin to mevinolin treatment further lowered total (5%) and LDL (4%) cholesterol concentrations, it also reduced HDL cholesterol levels (19%) (P less than 0.05). Therefore mevinolin normalizes the plasma lipid concentrations in patients with type II hyperlipoproteinemia and combined mevinolin and neomycin treatment offers no advantage over mevinolin-only therapy. In addition, these findings emphasize the importance of determining the HDL cholesterol level to fully evaluate the effects of hypolipidemic therapy.", 
    "37": "CS-514, one of the derivatives of ML-236B which is an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, has been previously shown to effectively reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in dogs, rabbits and humans. We determined the effect of CS-514 on glucose, lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein (apo) levels in plasma of 8 hypercholesterolemic diabetics (2 males). Total and LDL cholesterol and apo B levels were significantly decreased (P less than 0.005) 3 months after CS-514 treatment. High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was increased (P less than 0.05). Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) did not change throughout the observation period. No clinically serious adverse effects were experienced by the patients. We conclude that CS-514 can be a useful drug in the treatment of hypercholesterolemic diabetics and is remarkably free of any evidence of toxicity or unwanted side effects even in diabetics.", 
    "38": "When cell extracts from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells were assayed for isopentenyl adenine content and correlation with cell growth stage by radioimmunoassay, concentrations of low statistical significance were obtained. High performance liquid chromatographic analysis of cell extracts showed undetectable levels of isopentenyl adenine or 8-hydroxy-isopentenyl adenine, a known metabolite. Thus these substances do not seem to be required for cell division in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells.", 
    "39": "A limited study was conducted to determine the biological consequences of rendering the phenyl rings of the previously reported 7-(3,5-disubstituted [1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yl)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acids coplanar. Such constraint substantially diminished intrinsic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity.", 
    "40": "Adhesive interactions between tumor cells and the endothelial cells are presumed to be an obligatory step in the metastatic process. Using an in vitro model, we have examined the role of endothelial lipids in the regulation of this interaction. The cholesterol levels of bovine aorta endothelial cell monolayers were inhibited by the addition of compactin, 25-hydroxycholesterol, or 7-ketocholesterol. Metastatic B16 melanoma cells prelabeled with 14C-amino acid mixture were then deposited on this monolayer as a suspension and, at various time intervals, the number of cells adhering to the monolayer was determined. The results indicated that inhibition of cellular cholesterol caused enhancement in cell adhesion. On the other hand, perturbations of the glycosylation in the endothelial cells were without any effect on cell adhesion. The presence of cholesterol dispersion in the growth medium partially reversed the enhancement in cell adhesion caused by the cholesterol inhibitors. Growth in the presence of retinol or dexamethasone (1 microM) also caused enhancement in the adhesiveness of the tumor cells to endothelial cells, possibly because of their effects on cholesterol synthesis. Procaine, a local anesthetic which is known to increase membrane fluidity, also increased the tumor cell-endothelial interaction, suggesting that the membrane fluidity plays an important role in the regulation of cell adhesion.", 
    "41": "Modification of the 2(S)-methylbutyryl moiety of mevinolin led to a series of side chain ester derivatives. A systematic exploration of the structure-activity relationships showed that the introduction of an additional aliphatic group on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl group increased potency. This observation led to the synthesis of compound 16, which has about 2.5 times the intrinsic inhibitory activity of mevinolin.", 
    "42": "Studies were conducted to explore the effects of mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, on the growth and morphology of normal and transformed murine fibroblasts. Mevinolin is known to block DNA synthesis and cell growth in a number of kinds of non-transformed cells. Eight cell lines were studied, including two normal fibroblast cell lines (C3H 10T 1/2 and NIH 3T3) and derivatives of these cell lines transformed by chemical carcinogens, X-irradiation or the H-ras oncogene. All of the eight cell lines displayed appreciable growth inhibition by 5 microM mevinolin and marked inhibition by 30 microM mevinolin. Mevinolin also induced a marked rounding in the morphology of all of the cell lines. These effects of mevinolin on cell growth and morphology were blocked or reversed by the addition of mevalonic acid. Thus, both normal and transformed cells require mevalonate, or an as yet unidentified metabolite of mevalonate for their growth, even though some transformed cells have become relatively autonomous of other growth factors. Whereas mevinolin acted primarily as a cytostatic agent for most of the cell lines studied, with the transformed cell line MCA/10T 1/2, which ordinarily grows to a very high cell density, prolonged exposure to mevinolin caused marked cytotoxicity. Thus mevinolin might be useful as an anti-tumor agent for specific tumors.", 
    "43": "Patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations in the top 10th percentile of the population (type II hyperlipoproteinemia [HLP]) are at increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease; however, the incidence of myocardial infarction and death can be decreased by LDL cholesterol reduction. Mevinolin, an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, has been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol concentrations in a subset of type II patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Using a double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial, the safety and efficacy of mevinolin were compared in 24 patients with type II HLP with heterozygous FH (n = 6) or without FH type II HLP (n = 18). Compared with placebo treatment, both apolipoprotein B and LDL cholesterol levels were reduced (p less than 0.01) in both FH and non-FH patients by 28 to 34% with mevinolin treatment. In addition, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly increased (p less than 0.001) in both patients with FH (16%) and those with non-FH type II HLP (14%). Patients had no serious or clinically significant adverse effects. Thus, mevinolin is a useful drug for treatment of most patients with elevated plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations.", 
    "44": "The microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the cholesterogenic pathway and was proposed to be composed in situ of 2 noncovalently linked subunits (Edwards, P.A., Kempner, E.S., Lan, S.-F., and Erickson, S.K. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10278-10282). In the present report, the activities and kinetic properties of HMG-CoA reductase in microsomes isolated from livers of rats fed on diets supplemented with either ground Amberlite XAD-2 (\"X\"), cholestyramine/mevinolin (\"CM\"), or unsupplemented, normal rat chow (\"N\"), were compared. The specific activities of HMG-CoA reductase in X and CM microsomes were, respectively, 5- and 83-fold higher than that of N microsomes. In NADPH-dependent kinetics of HMG-CoA reductase activated with 4.5 mM GSH, the concentration of NADPH required for half-maximal velocity (S0.5) was 209 +/- 23, 76 +/- 23, and 40 +/- 4 microM for the N, X, and CM microsomes, respectively. While reductase from X microsomes displays cooperative kinetics toward NADPH (Hill coefficient (nH) = 1.97 +/- 0.07), the enzyme from CM microsomes does not (nH = 1.04 +/- 0.07). Similarly to HMG-CoA reductase from CM microsomes, the freeze-thaw solubilized enzyme (\"SOL\") displays no cooperativity toward NADPH and its Km for this substrate is 34 microM. At 4.5 mM GSH, HMG-CoA reductase from X, CM, and SOL preparations has a similar Km value for [DL]-HMG-CoA, ranging between 13-16 microM, while reductase from N microsomes had a higher Km value (42 microM) for this substrate. No cooperativity towards HMG-CoA was observed in any of the tested enzyme preparations. Immunoblotting analyses of the different preparations demonstrated that the observed altered kinetics of HMG-CoA reductase in the microsomes is not due to preferential proteolytic cleavage of the native 97-100 kDa subunit of the enzyme to the noncooperative 50-55 kDa species. Moreover, it was found that the ratio enzymatic activity/immunoreactivity of the reductase increased in the order N less than X less than CM approximately equal to SOL, indicating that the activity per reductase molecule increases with the induction of the enzyme. These results are compatible with a model suggesting that dietary induction of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase may change the state of functional aggregation of its subunits.", 
    "45": "An antibody against acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase purified from rat liver was raised in rabbits. Utilizing the binding of antibody-antigen complexes to a nitrocellulose membrane, a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to estimate the enzyme concentration in rat tissues. The enzyme concentration (microgram immunoreactive protein/mg protein) in rat liver cytosol was increased about 3-, 1.8- and 7-fold by feeding rats diets containing 5% cholestyramine, 0.2% ML-236B (compactin), and 5% cholestyramine plus 0.2% ML-236B for 4 days, respectively, and decreased about 1.8-fold by fasting the animals or 1.3-fold by feeding them a diet containing 5% cholesterol. Changes in the enzyme activity were almost parallel to those in the enzyme concentration, suggesting the physiological role of this enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Immunoblotting of the hepatic cytosol also confirmed that the increase in enzyme concentration on cholestyramine and/or ML-236B feeding was due to an increase in an enzyme protein the same as the purified enzyme and not the isozymic protein. Among various rat tissues examined, the concentrations of immunologically crossreactive enzyme were higher in lipogenic tissues, such as brain, adipose tissue and liver, than in other tissues. The enzymes in these three tissues were identical in molecular weight determined by gel filtration and immunoblotting.", 
    "46": "A cell-free system assay involving cell freeze-thawing and protein fractionation by ammonium sulfate precipitation was developed to characterize a cytosol binding protein specific for oxysterols in rat embryo fibroblasts. This protein shared common characteristics with the oxysterol-binding protein described in L cells and in normal human lymphocytes: 8 S sedimentation coefficient, sterol-protein complex of Mr 160 600, saturability, high affinity (Kd in the range of 10(-9) M) and specificity for cholesterol derivatives oxidized on the side chain. These compounds were better inhibitors of DNA synthesis than the compounds oxidized on the nucleus, whereas no difference was found between sterols oxygenated either on the side chain or on the nucleus, as far as inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) was concerned. Macromolecular components capable of specifically binding 25-hydroxycholesterol were also detected in the fibroblast nucleus. The cytosol oxysterol-binding protein showed a sharp increase (5-fold) in the G2M phase of the cell cycle and in exponentially growing cells (maximal binding site number/cell: 43 500, versus 8850 in confluent cells). Neither the affinity nor the sedimentation coefficient of the protein changed in either situation. The quantitative (but not qualitative) variations of oxysterol-binding protein could be related to the inhibitory effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol on DNA synthesis, which becomes critical when this sterol is added in the G2M phase of the cell cycle.", 
    "47": "In familial hypercholesterolemia, structural and functional abnormalities of the receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lead to hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis. We have developed a simplified method to identify LDL-receptor defects in peripheral-blood lymphocytes. When lymphocytes are cultured in lipoprotein-depleted medium and endogenous sterol biosynthesis is suppressed with mevinolin, mitogen-stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes is dependent on an exogenous source of cholesterol. Whereas a small concentration of supplemental LDL cholesterol (3 to 4 micrograms per milliliter) permits a maximal response in normal lymphocytes, even high concentrations (10 to 50 micrograms per milliliter) are unable to support the proliferation of lymphocytes from patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Thus, functional LDL receptors are necessary to allow lymphocyte proliferation in these cultures. The response of lymphocytes from patients with hyperlipidemia not caused by defective LDL receptors was like that of normal cells. In contrast, the response of lymphocytes from patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was intermediate between that of homozygotes and that of normal or hyperlipidemic controls. Our method can therefore be used to identify persons who are heterozygous for abnormalities of LDL receptors.", 
    "48": "Results presented here show that when isolated rat hepatocytes are incubated with increasing concentrations of [2-14C]mevalonolactone, incorporation of the substrate into cholesterol is progressively reduced. Correspondingly, an increase of the incorporation of the substrate into precursors of cholesterol (methyl sterols and squalene) occurs. These effects and the observed inhibition of HMGCoA reductase at high mevalonolactone concentration (0.5 mM) are in agreement with those shown by others in cultured hepatocytes. Since pantethine was reported to affect cholesterol biosynthesis from mevalonate in cultured fibroblasts, effects of its addition to hepatocyte incubations at low and high mevalonolactone concentration were studied. Neither the amount of radioactivity incorporated into cholesterol and in its sterol precursors nor sterol levels were modified by pantethine when a mevalonolactone concentration (0.01 mM) that did not alter the levels of intermediates of cholesterol synthesis was used. Pantethine was shown instead to potentiate the decrease of mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol induced by high concentrations of mevalonolactone (0.5 mM). Decrease of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase activity induced by 1 mM pantethine was twice that caused by mevalonolactone alone. These results may explain the fact that both in laboratory animals and in humans pantethine administration is effective in reducing cholesterol plasma levels in hyperlipidemic conditions.", 
    "49": "Primary cultures of newborn rat brain, which are composed predominantly of astroglia, were used to examine the relationship between the sterol biosynthetic pathway and DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. Reduction of the fetal calf serum content of the culture medium from 10 to 0.1% (vol/vol) for an interval of 48 h between days 4 and 6 in culture resulted in a quiescent state characterized by inhibition of DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. When 10% fetal calf serum was returned to the medium for these quiescent cells, within 24 h DNA synthesis increased markedly. Preceding the rise in DNA synthesis was an increase in sterol synthesis, which occurred within 12 h of the return of the quiescent cells to the 10% fetal calf serum. Exposure of the quiescent cells to mevinolin, a specific inhibitor of sterol synthesis at the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase step, completely inhibited the increase in DNA synthesis that followed serum repletion. The increase in total protein synthesis that followed serum repletion was not similarly inhibited by mevinolin. When mevinolin was removed after causing the 24-h inhibition of DNA synthesis, the cultured cells underwent active DNA synthesis and proliferation. Thus, inhibition of the sterol biosynthetic pathway resulted in a specific and reversible inhibition of DNA synthesis and glial proliferation in developing glial cells. These findings establish a valuable system for the examination of glial proliferation, i.e., primary glial cultures subjected to serum depletion and subsequent repletion. Moreover, the data establish an obligatory relationship between the sterol biosynthetic pathway and DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation in developing glia.", 
    "50": "The regulation of cholesterol synthesis has been studied using a rat epithelial intestinal cell line (IRD 98) as a cellular model. As observed in other cell types, mevinolin increases the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) and concomitantly reduces the incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol. Free cholesterol is able to suppress reductase activity. In contrast, when cells are shifted from standard culture medium to lipoprotein-deficient medium, an increase in hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase specific activity (2-5-fold) is observed. The possible regulatory roles of the different classes of human lipoproteins were thus compared. The effects of a long-term exposure to LDL and HDL vary according to cell density. In actively growing cells, VLDL and LDL cause a decrease in the level of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, whereas HDL do not have a significant effect. In contrast, in subconfluent preresting cells, HDL provoke large decreases in hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity as compared to VLDL and LDL. While LDL binding is constant, the maximal binding capacity of HDL in subconfluent cells is seven times that of actively growing cells. Altogether, these results suggest an important role for HDL in the regulation of intestinal cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "51": "The LDL receptor synthesis of human skin fibroblasts in the presence of the specific calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, condensation product of N-methyl-p-methoxyphenethylamine with formaldehyde (compound 48/80) and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide) (W-7) was studied. Labelling of cells with [35S]methionine followed by immunoprecipitation of radioactive LDL receptor protein with monospecific antibodies revealed that calmodulin antagonists caused a 3-fold increase in the radioactivity of the LDL receptor protein as compared with values found in control cells. A corresponding increase of high-affinity binding and internalization of 125I-labelled LDL was observed. The drugs did not influence the overall protein synthesis or the half-life of the LDL receptor. A concomitant suppression of cholesterol synthesis from [14C]mevalonolactone was found to be an independent effect. The calmodulin antagonist-produced stimulation of LDL receptor synthesis could not be simulated by preincubation of cells with cyclic nucleotide analogues, cholera toxin or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, known as specific effectors of adenylate cyclase and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, respectively. Modulation of calcium concentration in the incubation medium had no reproducible effect on the rate of LDL receptor synthesis. The results implicate calmodulin as an intracellular suppressor of LDL receptor synthesis in human skin fibroblasts.", 
    "52": "Halobacterium halobium was evaluated as a potentially simpler biological model to study the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity (content) in response to mevalonate availability. H. halobium's HMG-CoA reductase was soluble and required NADPH as its reduced coenzyme. Maximum HMG-CoA reductase activity (4-10 nmol/min/mg of soluble protein) was obtained in buffers which contained 3.5 M KCl. Mevinolin (a) blocked growth of H. halobium, (b) was a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (Ki = 20 nM), (c) did not cause the paradoxical increase in assayable reductase activity, as reported for eukaryotic cells, and (d) caused a rapid (within 30 min) 8-12-fold accumulation of intracellular HMG-CoA. Mevalonate blocked and reversed mevinolin-mediated HMG-CoA accumulation. Although mevinolin-treated cell's growth was restored by mevalonate, HMG-CoA reductase's activity was not. Thus, H. halobium is a unique biological model which allows one to study the regulation of intracellular HMG-CoA concentration and not HMG-CoA reductase activity (content) in response to mevalonate availability.", 
    "53": "Mitogen-induced lymphocyte DNA synthesis measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation and lymphocyte proliferation assessed by counting the number of cells were reduced by greater than 95% when cells were cultured at low density in the absence of serum. Supplementation with either transferrin or lipoprotein alone only partially restored lymphocyte responses. Addition of both transferrin and lipoproteins of each major subclass permitted mitogen-induced lymphocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation equal to that observed in serum-containing medium. The degree of enhancement was dependent on the concentration of the lipoprotein added and could not be explained by the nonspecific addition of protein to the defined medium. The mechanisms of growth promotion by various lipoprotein fractions did not appear to be explained by provision of cholesterol to the cells. Neither cholesterol nor cholesteryl ester from endogenous sources or supplied exogenously was able to enhance mitogen-induced lymphocyte responses. In contrast, fatty acids, phospholipid, and triglyceride alone supported lymphocyte responses. Furthermore, lipoproteins retained the capacity to enhance lymphocyte responses following extraction of neutral lipid. Both low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein, subclass 3, increased the number of cells initially activated by mitogenic stimulation and supported the subsequent continued growth of the activated cells. Low density lipoprotein was more efficient than high density lipoprotein, subclass 3, in this latter regard. These results indicate that lipoproteins can promote maximal growth of mitogen-activated lymphocytes in transferrin-containing medium by providing growth factors other than cholesterol necessary for initial activation and required for continued lymphocyte proliferation.", 
    "54": "Cholesteryl ester accumulation in arterial wall macrophages (foam cells) is a prominent feature of atherosclerotic lesions. We have previously shown that J774 macrophages accumulate large amounts of cholesteryl ester when incubated with unmodified low density lipoprotein (LDL) and that this is related to sluggish down-regulation of the J774 LDL receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. To further explore intracellular cholesterol metabolism and regulatory events in J774 macrophages, we studied the effect of inhibitors of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) on the cells' ability to accumulate cholesterol and to down-regulate receptor and reductase. Treatment of J774 cells with LDL in the presence of ACAT inhibitor 58-035 (Sandoz) prevented both cholesteryl ester and total cholesterol accumulation. Furthermore, 58-035 markedly enhanced down-regulation of the J774 LDL receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in the presence of LDL. In dose-response studies, down-regulation of the receptor by 58-035 paralleled its inhibition of ACAT activity. Compound 58-035 also increased the down-regulation of the J774 LDL receptor in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol and acetyl-LDL but not in the presence of cholesteryl hemisuccinate, which is not an ACAT substrate. The ability of 58-035 to enhance LDL receptor down-regulation was negated when cells were simultaneously incubated with recombinant high density lipoprotein3 discs, which promote cellular cholesterol efflux. In contrast to the findings with J774 macrophages, down-regulation of the human fibroblast LDL receptor was not enhanced by 58-035. These data suggest that in J774 macrophages, but not in fibroblasts, ACAT competes for a regulatory pool of intracellular cholesterol, contributing to diminished receptor and reductase down-regulation, LDL-cholesterol accumulation, and foam cell formation.", 
    "55": "Isolated rat hepatocytes were cultured in monolayer for about 24 h. During this period the cells exhibited constant protein and lipid synthesis. When the culture medium contained compactin, a competitive inhibitor of the 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutary-coenzyme-A reductase, dolichyl-P synthesis was inhibited by 91% at the end of the incubation, as estimated by the incorporation of [3H]acetate and by 77% as estimated by the incorporation of 32Pi. These results indicate that in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes dolichyl monophosphate is mainly synthesized through a de novo process, while phosphorylation through the CTP-mediated kinase is of limited functional importance.", 
    "56": "The kinetics of cell cycle progression in continuously proliferating 3T3 fibroblasts and two tumor transformed derivatives (3T6 and SV 3T3 cells) following treatment by growth-factor deprivation (serum starvation) or 25-hydroxycholesterol were studied. Normal 3T3 cells were found to respond immediately (in the first cycle) to growth factor deprivation by leaving the cell cycle from G1, whereas the tumor transformed derivatives did not. However, all three cell types were forced to stop the progression through the beginning of G1 when treated by 25-hydroxycholesterol. It was ensured that the doses of 25-hydroxycholesterol used really induced substantial decrease of HMG CoA reductase activity. However, the effects of serum starvation on HMG CoA reductase activity varied considerably. In 3T3 cells HMG CoA reductase activity was substantially depressed, in 3T6 cells it was moderately depressed, and in SV-3T3 cells it was not depressed at all. This difference of HMG CoA reductase activity between 3T6 and SV-3T3 cells was related to the difference of growth activity in serum-free medium. The data indicate that a certain activity of HMG CoA reductase is required for the proliferation of normal as well as tumor transformed cells but also that impairment of the control of HMG CoA reductase, leading to increased enzyme activity, may result in uncontrolled growth in tumor transformed cells.", 
    "57": "The effect of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on cholesterol biosynthesis was studied using a recently developed serum-free medium for the culture of porcine granulosa cells. Both cell proliferation and progesterone production were shown to be dependent on de novo cholesterol synthesis in studies with an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Under basal conditions, mevalonate levels appeared to be rate-limiting for steroidogenesis but not for cell growth. FSH treatment increased [1-14C]acetate incorporation into sterols and the intracellular content of free and esterified cholesterol. These effect were not abolished when steroidogenesis was inhibited at the cholesterol side-chain cleavage step. Estradiol also stimulated [1-14C]acetate incorporation into sterols. Quantification of progesterone secretion after blockade of cholesterol synthesis revealed the presence of intracellular pools of precursor sterols which required depletion before progesterone secretion ceased. These pools, which were tentatively ascribed to cholesterol and pregnenolone, were increased in FSH-treated cells. Stimulation of cholesterol biosynthesis may play a fundamental role in FSH action on these cells.", 
    "58": "The effect of inhibiting lysosomal protein degradation on the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was determined using a mouse mammary cell line (TS-85) which expresses a temperature-sensitive mutation in the ubiquitin degradative pathway. Incubating cells for 18 hr in medium containing 20 mM NH4Cl did not alter total protein synthesis or cell growth, but it did inhibit the rate of total protein degradation by 19%, which is consistent with the known inhibitory effect of NH4Cl on lysosomal protein degradation. NH4Cl treatment also resulted in an increase (81% +/- 20) in HMG-CoA reductase activity. The increase in reductase activity was not correlated with changes in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme or with alteration in the relative rate of reductase synthesis. However, the basal degradation rate of the reductase was significantly inhibited, and after NH4Cl treatment, the half-life of the enzyme increased from 4.0 +/- 0.4 hr to 8.3 +/- 0.8 hr. The change in the rate of reductase degradation can account completely for the increase in reductase activity observed in NH4Cl-treated cells. The accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase induced by 25-hydroxycholesterol treatment was not affected by either NH4Cl or by inactivation of the ubiquitin degradative pathway. Therefore, two different mechanisms may be responsible for the accelerated degradation and basal degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. The latter can be inhibited by NH4Cl and may imply that under basal conditions the enzyme may be degraded in lysosomes.", 
    "59": "Alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) activity in bovine aortic endothelial cells in culture was stimulated in a synergistic manner by 10(-6) M retinol and by 10(-7) M dexamethasone. An early exposure to retinol was required for maximum stimulation and could be reproduced by the addition, during growth, of 2 micrograms/ml compactin. The induced enzyme activity in cell lysates prepared from cells treated with retinol and dexamethasone had a Vmax that was 50-fold that of the controls. The stimulatory effect of retinol could be partially reversed by the addition of sonic dispersions made from cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine. The incorporation of [14C]acetate into saponifiable and non-saponifiable cellular lipids was inhibited by 10(-6) M retinol but the activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (EC 4.1.3.5) remained unaffected. The results suggest that retinol might inhibit lipid biosynthesis through an alternate mechanism.", 
    "60": "The regulation of the LDL receptor activity in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2 was studied. In Hep G2 cells, in contrast with fibroblasts, the LDL receptor activity was increased 2.5-fold upon increasing the concentration of normal whole serum in the culture medium from 20 to 100% by volume. Incubation of the Hep G2 cells with physiological concentrations of LDL (up to 700 micrograms/ml) instead of incubation under serum-free conditions resulted in a maximum 2-fold decrease in LDL receptor activity (10-fold decrease in fibroblasts). Incubation with physiological concentrations of HDL with a density of between 1.16 and 1.20 g/ml (heavy HDL) resulted in an approximately 7-fold increase in LDL receptor activity (1.5-fold increase in fibroblasts). This increased LDL receptor activity is due to an increase in the number of LDL receptors. Furthermore, simultaneous incubation of Hep G2 cells with LDL and heavy HDL (both 200 micrograms/ml) resulted in a 3-fold stimulation of the LDL receptor activity as compared with incubation in serum-free medium. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity was also stimulated after incubation of Hep G2 with heavy HDL (up to 3-fold). The increased LDL receptor activity in Hep G2 cells after incubation with heavy HDL was independent of the action of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase during that incubation. However, previous modification of heavy HDL by lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase resulted in an enhanced ability of heavy HDL to stimulate the LDL receptor activity. Our results indicate that in Hep G2 cells the heavy HDL-mediated stimulation of the LDL receptor activity overrules the LDL-mediated down-regulation and raises the suggestion that in man the presence of heavy HDL and the action of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase in plasma may be of importance in receptor-mediated catabolism of LDL by the liver.", 
    "61": "The production of the sesquiterpenoid antibiotic pentalenolactone in the producer strain Streptomyces arenae TU 469 is controlled by the activity of the enzyme farnesylpyrophosphate cyclase. In contrast to the activity of this enzyme, the specific activities of all other enzymes of the mevalonoid pathway tested so far, proved to be not rate-limiting. Several metabolites of the pentalenolactone pathway were tested for inhibitory effects on the activity of the HMG-CoA reductase and farnesylpyrophosphate cyclase. The activity of the cyclase was inhibited by low concentrations of pentalenolactone and its derivatives, thus suggesting an end product inhibition of the starting enzyme of the pentalenolactone pathway. The activity of HMG-CoA reductase was not inhibited by pentalenene or any pentalenolactone-derivatives. According to these results, an end-product inhibition of the first enzyme which is specific for pentalenolactone synthesis seems to be a mechanism involved in the regulation of pentalenolactone biosynthesis.", 
    "62": "The syntheses of a series of 7-(3,5-disubstituted [1,1'-bephenyl]-2-yl)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acids and their lactones are reported. Intrinsic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitory activity is enhanced markedly when the biphenyl moiety is substituted by chloro or methyl groups at positions 3 and 5 and a fluoro group at position 4'. These substitutions, followed by resolution, provided compounds 100(+) and 110(+) with 2.8 times the intrinsic inhibitory activity of compactin. Compound 100(+) was shown to possess the same chirality in the lactone ring as compactin by single-crystal X-ray crystallography.",

Current data suggest that VLDL remnants can be removed by the same receptors that remove low density lipoproteins (LDL). Mevinolin has been shown to enhance clearance of LDL by LDL receptors. In this study, mevinolin markedly lowered both VLDL remnants and LDL in a patient with type 3 HLP, presumably by increasing the activity of LDL receptors.", 
    "65": "The biochemistry, etiology, and evaluation of hyperlipidemia and its management, including dietary and drug therapies, are discussed. Strong evidence supports the role of increased cholesterol concentrations as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD); however, evidence that elevated triglyceride concentrations are also an independent risk factor remains questionable. The cornerstone of the laboratory diagnosis of hyperlipidemia involves repeated measurement of serum or plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. The goals of therapy should be to reduce cholesterol or triglyceride concentrations or both to below the 75th percentile, modify co-existing risk factors, individualize the treatment, and minimize any adverse effects. Specific interventions must be determined on the basis of patient age, gender, etiology of hyperlipidemia, presence of other risk factors, and degree of lipid abnormality. The majority of patients may be managed with dietary therapy alone. The three-phase diet developed by the American Heart Association emphasizes a gradual reduction in cholesterol and fats with the substitution of polyunsaturated for saturated fats. Patients at risk for CAD with sustained elevations in plasma cholesterol concentrations above the 95th percentile or a triglyceride concentration above 500 mg/dL after an adequate dietary trial should be considered for drug therapy. The effects of cholestyramine and colestipol hydrochloride, niacin, dextrothyroxine, clofibrate, neomycin sulfate, probucol, gemfibrozil, and mevinolin and compactin on lipids and lipoproteins are reviewed. Hyperlipidemia should be managed systematically using information about the association between increased lipid concentrations and CAD, patient risk factors, and limitations of both diet and drug therapy.", 
    "66": "Because the absence of high affinity glucocorticoid receptors in lymphoid leukemia cells does not always correlate with the resistance to glucocorticoids in vitro, an effort was made to identify an alternate biochemical marker which, independently from the receptor system, would improve the reliability of the existing in vitro sensitivity assays as predictors of the patients' response to glucocorticoid therapy. Two receptor-containing lines of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, one glucocorticoid sensitive (CEM-C7) and one glucocorticoid resistant (CEM-C1), were used to study endogenous synthesis of cholesterol with [14C]-acetate as a cholesterol precursor. We found that dexamethasone inhibited cholesterol synthesis in the glucocorticoid-sensitive clone but was without effect on the resistant clone. In sensitive cells, this reduction in synthesis was paralleled by a decreased activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (EC 1.1.3.5) and was followed by a moderate decrease in cellular free cholesterol. Moreover, sonic dispersions of cholesterol in delipidized serum when added to the cultures reversed the growth-inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on CEM-C7 cells.", 
    "67": "As a class of compounds, oxysterols have demonstrated a wide variety of biological properties. Due to the general interest in these compounds, new methods of chemical synthesis have been developed to provide them for biological investigation. The specific inhibition by oxysterols of cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells has been shown to result primarily from a decrease in cellular levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. Recent evidence suggests these cellular responses may be mediated by an oxysterol binding protein found in the cytosol of many lines of cultured cells. In certain instances, oxysterols have been shown to be produced in biological systems. These results support the supposition that oxysterols may regulate sterol biosynthesis at the cellular level. Included herein are the inhibitory effects of 9 alpha, 11 alpha-epoxycholest-7-en-3 beta-ol cholest-8-en-3 beta-ol-7-one and cholest-8-en-3 beta-ol-11-one on HMG-CoA reductase activity and their relative affinities for a cytosolic binding protein.", 
    "68": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase exists in interconvertible active and inactive forms in cultured fibroblasts from normal and familial hypercholesterolemic subjects. The inactive form can be activated by endogenous or added phosphoprotein phosphatase. Active or partially active HMG-CoA reductase in cell extracts was inactivated by a ATP-Mg-dependent reductase kinase. Incubation of phosphorylated (inactive) HMG-CoA reductase with purified phosphoprotein phosphatase was associated with dephosphorylation (reactivation) and complete restoration of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Low density lipoprotein, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, and mevalonolactone suppressed HMG-CoA reductase activity by a short-term mechanism involving reversible phosphorylation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol, which enters cells without the requirement of low density lipoprotein-receptor binding, inhibited the HMG-CoA reductase activity in familial hypercholesterolemic cells by reversible phosphorylation. Measurement of the short-term effects of inhibitors on the rate of cholesterol synthesis from radiolabeled acetate revealed that HMG-CoA reductase phosphorylation was responsible for rapid suppression of sterol synthesis. Reductase kinase activity of cultured fibroblasts was also affected by reversible phosphorylation. The active (phosphorylated) reductase kinase can be inactivated by dephosphorylation with phosphatase. Inactive reductase kinase can be reactivated by phosphorylation with ATP-Mg and a second protein kinase from rat liver, designated reductase kinase kinase. Reductase kinase kinase activity has been shown to be present in the extracts of cultured fibroblasts. The combined results represent the initial demonstration of a short-term regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity and cholesterol synthesis in normal and receptor-negative cultured fibroblasts involving reversible phosphorylation of both HMG-CoA reductase and reductase kinase.", 
    "69": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria was detected in a newborn. The progress of the dietary therapy for the disorder was monitored by dual-column \"high-performance\" liquid chromatography with a computer-controlled photodiode array spectrophotometric detector. This procedure is a quick way to detect and monitor the progress of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria.", 
    "70": "Certain oxysterols are capable of suppressing the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. We have previously demonstrated that treatment of P815 cells with 1 microgram 25-hydroxycholesterol/ml culture results in a rapid influx of 45Ca, and supplemental cholesterol prevents this from occurring. In this paper, we report on investigations into the means whereby this influx of calcium takes place. Through the use of respiratory inhibitors which prevent mitochondrial retention of calcium it was determined that the large increase in slow phase (intracellular) calcium uptake caused by 25-hydroxycholesterol treatment was related to mitochondrial uptake. The effects of various inhibitors of calcium uptake into cells, including verapamil, diltiazem, quinidine, ruthenium red, Co++, Mn++, were tested. Of these only Co++ and ruthenium red had any effect on 45Ca uptake. 25-Hydroxycholesterol has been shown to be capable of membrane insertion and this could result in plasma membrane permeability changes. To test this hypothesis P815 cells were treated with 1 microgram 25-hydroxycholesterol/ml or 5 micrograms mevinolin/ml culture. Mevinolin, being a water soluble competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, should be unable to disrupt membrane architecture in a manner analogous to 25-hydroxycholesterol. While both inhibitors rapidly suppressed the synthesis of digitonin-precipitable sterols, only 25-hydroxycholesterol was able to increase 45Ca influx. The implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "71": "Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was used for treatment of 12 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia, but not classical familial hypercholesterolemia. For most patients, measurements of turnover of low density lipoprotein-apolipoprotein B (LDL-apoB) were made on placebo and during treatment with two doses of mevinolin. LDL turnover was determined after injection of autologous 125I-labeled radioiodinated LDL. Compared to placebo, a low dose of mevinolin (10 mg, twice daily (BID] caused reductions of plasma total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol averaging 15% and 20%, respectively; corresponding reductions on high doses of mevinolin (20 mg BID) were 22% and 31%, respectively. Triglyceride levels were unchanged by the drug. High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels rose significantly on the high dose, but not on the low dose. Neither dose produced a stastistically significant change in fractional catabolic rate (FCR) for LDL-apoB for the whole group, although several patients had increases in FCR on both doses. In contrast, both doses of mevinolin caused decreases in production rates of LDL-apoB. Thus, the fall in LDL levels in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia can be explained more by a reduction in the input rate of LDL-apoB than by enhanced fractional removal of LDL from the circulation.", 
    "72": "Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, stimulates neurite outgrowth and acetylcholinesterase (ACE) activity in C1300 (Neuro-2A) murine neuroblastoma cells. Sprouting of neurites began within 4-8 h, before changes in cell proliferation could be detected by [3H]thymidine incorporation or flow cytometry. In contrast, the increase in ACE activity was temporally correlated with suppression of DNA synthesis, which occurred after 8 h. The activity of the membrane marker enzyme phosphodiesterase I was not stimulated by mevinolin. Suppression of protein synthesis with cycloheximide blocked the induction of ACE activity but only partially inhibited neurite outgrowth in the mevinolin-treated cultures. When mevinolin was removed from the culture medium, most of the cells retracted their neurites within 2 h, but ACE activity did not decline until DNA synthesis began to return to control levels after 10 h. Similarly, retraction of neurites in differentiated cells exposed to colchicine was not accompanied by a decrease in ACE activity. DNA histograms suggested that mevinolin arrests neuroblastoma cells in both the G1 and G2/M compartments of the cell cycle. Other cytostatic drugs that arrest cells at different stages of the cell cycle did not cause Neuro-2A cells to form neurites such as those seen in the mevinolin-treated cultures. When incorporation of [3H]acetate into isoprenoid compounds was studied in cultures containing mevinolin in concentrations ranging from 0.25 microM to 25 microM, the labeling of cholesterol, dolichol, and ubiquinone was suppressed by 90% or more at all concentrations. However, significant growth arrest and cell differentiation were observed only at the highest concentrations of mevinolin. Supplementing the medium with 100 microM mevalonate prevented the cellular response to mevinolin, but additions of cholesterol, dolichol, ubiquinone, or isopentenyl adenine were generally ineffective. The cholesterol content of neuroblastoma cells incubated with 25 microM mevinolin for 24 h was not diminished, and protein glycosylation, measured by [3H]mannose incorporation, was decreased only after 24 h at high mevinolin concentration. These studies suggest that the stimulation of neurite outgrowth and the increase in ACE activity induced by mevinolin are independent phenomena. Whereas neurite outgrowth is not related directly to the effects of mevinolin on cell cycling, the induction of ACE is correlated with the inhibition of cell proliferation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "73": "Embryonic Drosophila cells (Kc cells) were used to further characterize sterol-independent modulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. 3-Methyl-3-5-dihydroxyvalerate (mevalonate), 3-fluoromethyl-3,5-dihydroxyvalerate (fluoromevalonate), and 3-ethyl-3,5-dihydroxyvalerate (homomevalonate) were tested as modulators. Although mevalonate caused a rapid, reversible suppression of reductase activity, fluoro- and homomevalonate increased activity; fluoromevalonate was more effective than homomevalonate. Mevalonate, added simultaneously with fluoromevalonate, blocked the analogue's effect on Kc cell reductase activity. However, mevalonate did not suppress an established fluoromevalonate increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity. Fluoromevalonate blocked [1-14C, 5-3H]mevalonate conversion to 14CO2- and 3H-labeled lipids and [3H] mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate accumulated. Neither protein nor RNA synthesis were required for mevalonate-mediated suppression of reductase activity. However, fluoromevalonate's effect on reductase activity required protein synthesis. Furthermore, in the absence of protein synthesis, fluoromevalonate-stabilized Kc cell HMG-CoA reductase activity. We have concluded that mevalonate, fluoromevalonate, homomevalonate, and compactin (mevinolin) modulated HMG-CoA reductase activity because they altered isoprenoid carbon flow to a post-isopentenyl 1-pyrophosphate regulatory, signal molecule.", 
    "74": "This study addresses whether transcriptional control of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase gene in rat liver plays a role in determining the level of reductase mRNA. Isolated rat liver nuclei were allowed to elongate nascent RNA transcripts in the presence of [alpha-32P]CTP, and radiolabeled nuclear reductase RNA was quantitated by filter hybridization. Rats fed a diet supplemented with the drugs cholestyramine and mevinolin and having 20-60-fold induced levels of reductase mRNA exhibited levels of reductase transcription which were 20-fold higher than in rats fed an unsupplemented diet. Over 90% of the transcription of the reductase gene was inhibited by concentrations of alpha-amanitin which selectively inhibit RNA polymerase II. Administration of mevalonolactone (the end product of the reaction catalyzed by reductase) to rats fed cholestyramine and mevinolin caused an 80% decrease in the rate of reductase transcription by approximately 1 h. We conclude that under these conditions changes in reductase transcription are primarily responsible for the regulation of reductase mRNA levels.", 
    "75": "A water-soluble derivative of cholesterol, methoxypolyoxyethylated (MPOE) cholesterol, has been synthesized and used to study the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the key regulatory enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. MPOE cholesterol causes a specific, rapid and linear decline in HMG-CoA reductase in cultured rat liver cells. MPOE cholesterol is not a direct allosteric inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, does not appear to regulate HMG-CoA reductase through changes in membrane environment, and does not change the phosphorylation state and level of activation of rat liver cell HMG-CoA reductase. In order to confirm our data, which were consistent with a model in which MPOE cholesterol regulates the amount of HMG-CoA reductase and not its activity, we made direct measurements of reductase mRNA levels. The decline in HMG-CoA reductase in MPOE cholesterol-treated rat liver cells is preceded by the rapid disappearance of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA. As a water-soluble cholesterol derivative, MPOE cholesterol represents a useful model compound for studies on the regulation of the level of HMG-CoA reductase and its cognate mRNA.", 
    "76": "Previously we showed that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol is formed from acetate, via squalene 2,3(S),22(S),23-dioxide and 24(S),25-oxidolanosterol, during the normal course of cholesterol biosynthesis in S10 rat liver homogenate (Nelson, J. A., Steckbeck, S. R., and Spencer, T. A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1067-1068; Nelson, J. A., Steckbeck, S. R., and Spencer, T. A. (1981) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, 6974-6975). Herein we demonstrate that the nonsaponifiable extract from human liver tissue contains 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol in an amount approximately 10(-3) relative to cholesterol. We show that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, like many other oxygenated sterols, represses hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity in cultured cells and binds to the cytosolic oxysterol-binding protein. Furthermore, we show that this epoxide is not rapidly metabolized in cultured cells. These results suggest that 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol may participate in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol metabolism in vivo.", 
    "77": "Statin, a 57,000-D protein characteristically found in nonreplicating cells, was identified by a monoclonal antibody produced by hybridomas established from mice injected with extracts of in vitro aged human fibroblasts (Wang, E., 1985, J. Cell Biol., 100:545-551). Fluorescence staining with the antibody shows that the expression of statin disappears upon reinitiation of the process for cell replication. The rapid de-expression is observed in fibroblasts involved in the in vitro wound-healing process, as well as in cells that have been subcultured after trypsinization and replated from a confluent culture. Kinetic analysis shows that 50% of the cell population lose their statin expression at 12 h after replating, before the actual events of mitosis. Immunogold labeling with highly purified antibodies localizes the protein at the nuclear envelope in nonreplicating cells, but not in their replicating counterparts. Immunoblotting analysis confirms the disappearance of statin in cells that have reentered the cycling process. Using the technique of flow cytometry to examine the large number of nonreplicating fibroblasts in confluent cultures, we have found that statin is mostly expressed in those cells showing the least amount of DNA content, whose growth is blocked at the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle. This close correlation is rapidly altered once the cells are released from the confluent state. These results suggest that the expression of statin may be regulated by a fine mechanism controlling the transition from the nonreplicating to the replicating state, and that the protein is structurally associated with the nuclear envelope.", 
    "78": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase catalyzes the formation of mevalonate, an essential precursor for isoprenoid compounds in mammalian cells. Recent studies have shown that mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of the reductase, inhibits cell proliferation and induces differentiation in cultured C1300 (Neuro-2A) murine neuroblastoma cells. We now report that mevinolin can inhibit neuroblastoma growth in vivo. The specific activity of HMG-CoA reductase in subcutaneous neuroblastomas increased more than 20-fold between the fifth and eighth days after tumor inoculation, and remained elevated for the remainder of the tumor lifetime in mice. The increase in reductase activity was correlated with a marked increase in tumor DNA content and exponential increase in tumor weight. Using an in vitro assay to monitor the ability of mouse serum to suppress sterol synthesis, we determined that mevinolin was inactivated or cleared from the circulation within 3-6 h after a single subcutaneous injection. However, by using subcutaneous osmotic pumps to deliver a constant infusion of mevinolin, we were able to maintain adequate blood levels of the drug for 7 d. Mevinolin (5 mg/kg per h) suppressed tumor growth (wet weight) significantly when treatment was carried out between day 1 and day 8 or between day 5 and day 12 after tumor inoculation. Histopathological examination of tumors from mevinolin-treated mice revealed few or no mitotic figures and marked cellular degeneration. Measurements of incorporation of (3H)acetate into neuroblastoma sterols and ubiquinones 24 h after implantation of osmotic pumps showed that mevinolin produced a marked inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis in the tumors in vivo. The data suggest that, in addition to their demonstrated utility as cholesterol-lowering drugs, competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase may have considerable potential as novel antineoplastic agents.", 
    "79": "Inactivation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase by reductase kinase and ATP-Mg needs either ADP or 5'-AMP as cofactors. 5'-AMP is a more potent activator of cytosolic reductase kinase than ADP. This capacity is expressed by increasing not only the rate of reductase inactivation, but also the rate of reductase phosphorylation from [gamma-32P]ATP. Activation constants, Ka, for 5'-AMP and ADP are 20 microM and 420 microM respectively. Neither 3'-AMP nor 2'-AMP activate reductase kinase. Other nucleoside monophosphates like UMP, CMP and GMP cannot replace 5'-AMP as activators of reductase kinase.", 
    "80": "The sigmoidal curves observed for rat liver microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase with NADPH as the varied substrate were markedly affected by feeding the animals diets containing colestipol, mevinolin and colestipol or cholesterol. Feeding of mevinolin and colestipol decreased the S0.5 for NADPH from 270 to 40 microM, while cholesterol feeding increased the value to 1.3 mM. Immuno-blotting analysis revealed that the Mr 100,000 form of HMG-CoA reductase predominated in cases where the S0.5 value was lowest, and the Mr 200,000 species was the major form where the S0.5 values were highest. Activation of HMG-CoA reductase by NADPH was not due to conversion of the Mr 200,000 form to the 100,000 form.", 
    "81": "Rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase catalyzes, in addition to its normal biosynthetic or forward reaction (HMG-CoA + 2 NADPH + 2H+----mevalonate + 2 NAD+ + CoASH), the reverse reaction (mevalonate + CoASH + 2 NADP+----HMG-CoA + 2 NADPH + 2H+) and two \"half-reactions\" that involve the presumed intermediate mevaldate (mevaldate + CoASH + NADP+----HMG-CoA + NADPH + H+ and mevaldate + NADPH + H+----mevalonate + NADP+). These reactions were studied using both enzyme solubilized by the traditional freeze-thaw method and enzyme solubilized with a nonionic detergent in the presence of inhibitors of proteolysis. All four reactions were inhibited by mevinolin, a known inhibitor of the forward (biosynthetic) reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. When the enzyme was inactivated by ATP and a cytosolic, ADP-dependent HMG-CoA reductase kinase, the rates of both the forward reaction and the half-reactions decreased to comparable extents. Although coenzyme A is not a stoichiometric participant in the second half-reaction (mevaldate + NADPH + H+----mevalonate + NADP+), it was required as an activator of this reaction. This observation implies that coenzyme A may remain bound to the enzyme throughout the normal catalytic cycle of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "82": "Previous studies established that following simultaneous injection of 125I-labeled homologous very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and 131I-labeled homologous low density lipoproteins (LDL) into miniature pigs, a large proportion of LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB) was synthesized directly, independent of VLDL or intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) apoB catabolism. The possibility that cholestyramine alone (a bile acid sequestrant) or in combination with mevinolin (a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor) could regulate the direct LDL apoB synthetic pathway was investigated. 125I-labeled VLDL and 131I-labeled LDL were injected into miniature pigs (n = 8) during a control period and following 18 days of cholestyramine treatment (1.0 g kg-1d-1) or following 18 days of treatment with cholestyramine and mevinolin (1.2 mg kg-1d-1). ApoB in each lipoprotein fraction was selectively precipitated using isopropanol in order to calculate specific activity. In control experiments, LDL apoB specific activity curves reached their peak values well before crossing the VLDL or IDL apoB curves. However, cholestyramine treatment resulted in LDL apoB curves reaching maximal values much closer to the point of intersection with the VLDL or IDL curves. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that cholestyramine reduced total LDL apoB flux by 33%, which was due entirely to inhibition of the LDL apoB direct synthesis pathway since VLDL-derived apoB was unaffected. In addition, the LDL apoB pool size was reduced by 30% and the fractional catabolic rate of LDL apoB was increased by 16% with cholestyramine treatment. The combination of mevinolin and cholestyramine resulted in an even more marked inhibition of the direct LDL apoB synthesis pathway (by 90%), and in two animals this pathway was completely abolished. This inhibition was selective as VLDL-derived LDL apoB synthesis was not significantly different. LDL apoB pool size was reduced by 60% due primarily to the reduced synthesis as well as a 40% greater fractional removal rate. These results are consistent with the idea that cholestyramine and mevinolin increase LDL catabolism by inducing hepatic apoB, E receptors. We have now shown that the direct synthesis of LDL apoB is selectively inhibited by these two drugs.", 
    "83": "The consequence of blocking the de novo synthesis of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) on mitochondrial ubiquinone content and respiratory function was studied in cultured C1300 (Neuro 2A) murine neuroblastoma cells. Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was used to suppress the synthesis of mevalonate, an essential precursor for the isoprenoid side chain of ubiquinone. At a concentration of 25 microM, mevinolin completely inhibited the incorporation of [3H]acetate into ubiquinone, isolated from cell extracts by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. Similar results were obtained when [14C]tyrosine was used as a precursor for the quinone ring. Through the use of reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography, it was established that the principal product of the ubiquinone pathway in murine neuroblastoma cells was ubiquinone-9. Inhibition of ubiquinone synthesis for 24h in cells cultured in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (which contains 0.14 nmol of ubiquinone/ml of serum) resulted in a 40-57% decline in the concentration of ubiquinone in the mitochondria. However, the activities of succinate-cytochrome c reductase and succinate dehydrogenase in whole-cell homogenates or mitochondria were not inhibited. The state 3 and uncoupled rates of respiration, determined by polarographic measurements of oxygen consumption in homogenates and mitochondria, were elevated slightly in the mevinolin-treated cells. The data demonstrate that, although mevalonate synthesis is important for the maintenance of the intramitochondrial ubiquinone pool in cultured cells, major changes in the ubiquinone content of the mitochondria can occur in intact cells without perturbation of respiratory function. However, the coincidence of decreased mitochondrial ubiquinone concentration and the inhibition of cell cycling previously observed in mevinolin-treated cells (Maltese, W.A. (1984) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 120, 454-460) suggests that the availability of ubiquinone may play a role in the regulation of mitochondrial and cellular proliferation.", 
    "84": "The activity of the microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase was assayed with a procedure based on the extraction of the product mevalonolactone in a benzene phase. Diamide is an uncompetitive inhibitor of the reaction, while coenzyme A disulfide and tetraethylthiouram disulfide act as non-competitive inhibitors. Diamide inhibition cooperatively increases with the inhibitor concentration. HMG produces a decrease in enzyme activity that combines with that of coenzyme A disulfide. Both CoASH and coenzyme A esters strongly inhibit the reductase activity. Three new synthetic compounds with either thio-ether or thio-ester groups also show inhibitory effect on the enzyme activity.", 
    "85": "The effect of fenofibrate treatment on serum cholesterol levels was studied in relation to the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in mononuclear cells from patients with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa and IIb. When patients who had received fenofibrate (300 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks were given placebo during a subsequent 2-months period, both serum cholesterol concentration and mononuclear cell HMGR increased significantly in both types IIa and IIb. After reinstitution of fenofibrate treatment both parameters gradually declined and returned close to the initial level after another 28 weeks. It is concluded that a part of the lipid-lowering action of fenofibrate may be due to an inhibition of cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "86": "Although both inhibitory and stimulatory actions of estradiol on swine granulosa cells have been described, the bases for these inconsistent effects are not clear. We have tested properties of ovarian follicles and in vitro culture conditions that result in consistently stimulatory effects of estradiol on progesterone biosynthesis. Stimulatory actions of estradiol (in contrast to inhibitory effects) were critically dependent upon the density of granulosa cells in culture and the size and maturational status of the parent Graafian follicles. Granulosa cells isolated from small, rather than medium or large sized, swine follicles exhibited the greatest peak response to estradiol, although half-maximally stimulatory concentrations (ED50) of estradiol were similar (mean, 81 ng/ml). Granulosa cells from atretic follicles also secreted increased quantities of progesterone in response to estradiol, but the ED50 for estrogen stimulation was significantly higher (ED50 = 322 ng/ml estradiol) than that of comparable healthy follicles (ED50 = 109 ng/ml). This estrogen-responsive system was used to test the mechanisms subserving estrogen's trophic actions on granulosa cells. Estradiol significantly enhanced the activity of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with consequently increased production of progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxypregn-4-en-3-one. Estrogen also augmented functional cholesterol side-chain cleavage activity in a dose- and time-dependent fashion with a resultant increase in pregnenolone biosynthesis. Moreover, parallel observations documented concordant dose responses for the synthesis of all three major progestins by pig granulosa cells. The trophic actions of estrogen on the steroidogenic pathway were associated with enhanced hydrolysis of endogenous cholesteryl ester stores but were not significantly antagonized by inhibition of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis. We conclude that suitable follicle selection and appropriate in vitro culture conditions provide a consistently estrogen-responsive granulosa-cell system, in which estradiol modulates certain key aspects of progestin and cholesterol metabolism. These trophic actions of estrogen are likely to prepare granulosa cells for the increased rates of progesterone biosynthesis ultimately required by fully differentiated luteal cells.", 
    "87": "Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have a 50% deficiency of receptors for plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) that induces a marked increase in plasma LDL levels. Two therapeutic measures that seem to increase the synthesis of LDL receptors are interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids with either bile-acid sequestrants or the ileal-exclusion operation, and competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase with mevinolin or compactin. To determine the effectiveness of this combination and the mechanisms of lowering LDL levels, we measured turnover rates of LDL apoprotein (apo-LDL) before and during treatment with mevinolin and colestipol in eight patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy reduced LDL cholesterol levels by an average of 52%; this response was due to a 40% increase in fractional catabolic rate of apo-LDL and a 26% decrease in its production rate. A similar response was obtained in two patients who had previously had an ileal-exclusion operation for severe hypercholesterolemia and who were treated with mevinolin."
