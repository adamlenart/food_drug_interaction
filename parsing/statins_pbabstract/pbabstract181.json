    "0": "Contrary to the decline in the prevalence of several risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and smoking, diabetes is an expanding health burden in the Western world. Because of the proatherosclerotic, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic states associated with diabetes, diabetic patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are at high risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. However, they derive at the same time greater benefit from evidence-based therapy than the non-diabetic individuals. The two mainstays of acute ACS therapy for diabetic patients are an aggressive platelet inhibition and an early invasive strategy. Aspirin should be administered in all patients and prasugrel is to be considered superior to clopidogrel in this setting. While the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in the diabetic ACS population has been associated with a mortality reduction, the role of these agents in the prasugrel era remains to be elucidated. Importantly, the aggressiveness of anti-thrombotic therapy should be balanced in each individual patient with the risk of bleeding. The benefit of early coronary angiography and, if needed, revascularization, in the setting of non-ST-segment elevation ACS is more pronounced in diabetic than in non-diabetic individuals. All patients, diabetics and non-diabetics, qualify for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as the therapy of choice for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. In order to reduce hemorrhagic complications related to vascular access for PCI, the radial approach should be favored. Additional important secondary preventive measures include high-dose statin therapy, ACE-Inhibition/angiotensin II receptor blockade, and adequate glucose metabolism control. Despite the documented efficacy, diabetic patients with ACS receive evidence-based treatments less frequently than non-diabetic individuals.",

    "3": "Women were older, had higher SBP, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but were less frequently smokers or diabetics, and had a lower DBP and incidence of coronary artery disease. A greater incidence of primary endpoint, a composite of cardiovascular events, occurred in men versus women [hazard ratio 1.37 (95% CI 1.02-1.85)]. Men in the valsartan group had a significant reduction in the primary endpoint [hazard ratio 0.6 (95% CI 0.44-0.82), P = 0.001], whereas a nonsignificant effect was found in women [hazard ratio 0.64 (95% CI 0.39-1.06), P = 0.075]. However, statistical heterogeneity of this valsartan effect was not found between sexes, and women of at least 55 years of age, mostly after menopause, in the valsartan group showed a significant risk reduction for the primary endpoint [hazard ratio 0.60 (95% CI 0.36-0.99)].",

Over the course of nearly a century of investigation, scientists have developed several lines of evidence that establish the causal connection between blood cholesterol, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease. Building on that knowledge, scientists and the pharmaceutical industry have successfully developed a remarkably effective class of drugs--the statins--that lower cholesterol levels in blood and reduce the frequency of heart attacks.",

The levels of LDL-C in the statin (-) group were similar in categories I, II and III according to the Japan Atherosclerosis Society (JAS) Guidelines 2007, whereas the levels of HDL-C significantly decreased and LDL-C/HDL-C significantly increased as the category number increased. In the statin (-) group, the prevalence of CAD in categories I, II and III was 0, 16 and 33%, respectively (p=0.0018 for trend), in patients with good control of LDL-C levels according to the Guidelines. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was per-formed to examine the association between the presence of CAD and 11 possible factors. Age and HDL-C in the statin (-) group, and HDL-C in the statin (+) group were identified as significant independent variables that correlated with the presence of CAD. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis in the statin (-) and statin (+) groups showed a higher area under the curve for HDL-C than for LDL-C, non-HDL-C or LDL-C/HDL-C. In particular, the cut-off levels of HDL-C with the greatest sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CAD in the statin (+) group were 55 mg/dL (sensitivity 0.816, specificity 0.510).",

    "16": "Epidemiologic studies showed that men treated with statins appear to have a lower incidence of sudden death than men without statins. However, the specific factor for this remained disappointingly elusive. We assessed whether pravastatin enhanced connexin43 expression after myocardial infarction through attenuation of endothelin-1. Twenty-four hours after ligation of the anterior descending artery, male Wistar rats were randomized to vehicle, pravastatin, mevalonate, bosentan, or a combination of pravastatin and mevalonate or pravastatin and bosentan for 4 wk. Myocardial endothelin-1 levels were significantly elevated in vehicle-treated rats at the border zone compared with sham-operated rats. Myocardial connexin43 expression at the border zone was significantly decreased in vehicle-treated infarcted rats compared with sham-operated rats. Attenuated connexin43 expression was blunted after administration of pravastatin, as assessed by immunofluorescence analysis, Western blotting, and real-time quantitative RT-PCR of connexin43. Bosentan enhanced connexin43 amount in infarcted rats and did not have additional beneficial effects on pravastatin-treated rats. Arrhythmic scores during programmed stimulation in vehicle-treated rats were significantly higher than scores in those treated with pravastatin. In contrast, the beneficial effects of pravastatin-induced connexin43 were abolished by the addition of mevalonate and a protein kinase C inducer. In addition, the amount of connexin43 showed significant increase after addition of bisindolylmaleimide, implicating that protein kinase C is a relevant target in endothelin-1-mediated connexin43 expression. Thus chronic use of pravastatin after infarction, resulting in enhanced connexin43 amount by attenuation of mevalonate-dependent endothelin-1 through a protein kinase C-dependent pathway, may attenuate the arrhythmogenic response to programmed electrical stimulation.",

The aetiologies of CKD included diabetes (53%), hypertension (10%) and glomerulonephritis (GN) (19%). At baseline, process engineering analyses were conducted on resource use and workflows within the clinics.

During the post-maturation phase, pitavastatin prevented excessive triglyceride accumulation, which was associated with attenuated glucose transporter-4 expression, and dose-dependently upregulated hormone-sensitive lipase expression. Decrements in the adiponectin/plasminogen activator-1 ratio were also dose-dependently inhibited. In KKAy mice, Coulter counter analyses revealed that pitavastatin treatment significantly decreased (by 16.8%) the frequency of hypertrophic adipocytes (>150 microm in diameter) in parametrial adipose pads, of which total weight remained unaltered. Correspondingly, plasma adiponectin was significantly higher in pitavastatin-treated KKAy mice than in the untreated KKAy mice (12.5+/-3.8 microg/ml vs. 8.3+/-1.5 microg/ml, p<0.05). Moreover, the area under the time-glucose curve after intraperitoneal insulin was decreased by 16% in pitavastatin-treated KKAy mice (p<0.05 vs. untreated controls).", 
    "24": "Pitavastatin did not impair differentiation/maturation of preadipocytes and prevented their deterioration with hypertrophy after maturation at clinical concentrations in vitro. These effects likely contributed to improved insulin sensitivity, in an obese model, via prevention of adipocyte hypertrophy and adipocytokine dysregulation.", 
    "25": "Exercise training is advocated in insulin resistance and statins are used to treat hyperlipidaemia, two cardiometabolic risk factors often presenting concurrently. Statin intake may blunt mitochondrial function and the adaptive response to exercise training. Thus combining exercise training with statin administration may have adverse effects. We examined whether improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function mediated by progressive exercise training are affected by statin use. A group of 14 obese elderly males on statins (ST) and 22 matched control subjects (C) were examined. Results on in vivo mitochondrial function [MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy)], mitochondrial density (Western blotting), insulin sensitivity (clamp) and metabolic flexibility (indirect calorimetry) were compared before and after a 12-week combined progressive exercise training programme (3 x per week; 45 min per session). Except for LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, all pre-training values were comparable between statin users and control subjects. In vivo mitochondrial function and mitochondrial density improved by training in both groups. Interestingly, blood-lipid profile, insulin sensitivity (+72%), non-oxidative and oxidative glucose disposal (+38% and +112%) and insulin-mediated suppression of fat oxidation (-62%) improved only in the ST group. We conclude that statin treatment did not impede exercise performance or tolerance, mitochondrial function or mass. In addition, training-induced improvements in glucose homoeostasis were preserved in the ST group. Strikingly, the insulin-sensitizing effect of training was more prominent in the ST group than in the C group. The combined prescription of statins along with exercise training is safe and should be considered for subjects prone to develop insulin resistance.",

Despite 70% increases in HDL-C, development of the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib was halted due to excess mortality, attributed largely to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system resulting in hypertensive effects. Development of the CETP inhibitors dalcetrapib and anacetrapib is ongoing. Dalcetrapib has a unique chemical structure and induces a conformational change in CETP rather than forming a non-productive CETP/HDL-C complex as do the other CETP inhibitors. Although dalcetrapib is the least potent CETP inhibitor of the three in terms of CETP activity, the 900-mg dose did not increase blood pressure or raise aldosterone levels over 48 weeks of follow-up. The 600-mg dose of dalcetrapib is moving forward and raises HDL-C by 25 - 30% when used alone or in combination with a statin, with little effect on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.",

All five were conducted in ambulatory care: three in primary clinical care and two in specialised care. Four of the studies targeted physicians only and one targeted nurses only. In only two of the five RCTs was a statistically significant effect size associated with the intervention to have healthcare professionals adopt SDM. The first of these two studies compared a single intervention (a patient-mediated intervention: the Statin Choice decision aid) to another single intervention (also patient-mediated: a standard Mayo patient education pamphlet). In this study, the Statin Choice decision aid group performed better than the standard Mayo patient education pamphlet group (standard effect size = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.62 to 1.50). The other study compared a multifaceted intervention (distribution of educational material, educational meeting and audit and feedback) to usual care (control group) (standard effect size = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.30 to 2.90). This study was the only one to report an assessment of barriers prior to the elaboration of its multifaceted intervention.",

Healthcare professional training may be important, as may the implementation of patient-mediated interventions such as decision aids. Given the paucity of evidence, however, those motivated by the ethical impetus to increase SDM in clinical practice will need to weigh the costs and potential benefits of interventions. Subsequent research should involve well-designed studies with adequate power and procedures to minimise bias so that they may improve estimates of the effects of interventions on healthcare professionals' adoption of SDM. From a measurement perspective, consensus on how to assess professionals' adoption of SDM is desirable to facilitate cross-study comparisons.",

Medical doctors / angiologists treated more women (n = 109) than men (n = 34), (p = 0.002) and documented smoking and diabetes mellitus more often (p < 0.001) than vascular surgeons. Besides, patients had similar cardiovascular risk profiles and concomitant diseases, vascular surgeons prescribed 5.47 +/- 2.26 drugs, medical doctors / angiologists 6.37 +/- 2.67 (p = 0.005). Overall, 239 (90.5 %) patients were on aspirin, 180 (68.2 %) on clopidogrel, and 18 (6.9 %) on oral anticoagulants.

Recently, statin-induced apoptosis has been associated with down-regulation of survivin expression in cancer cells. However, the mechanism of deregulated survivin by simvastatin on lung cancer is still unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that simvastatin induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in A549 lung cancer cells. Simvastatin also resulted in a decrease in the expression of phosphorylated Akt. In addition, simvastatin effectively down-regulated survivin mRNA and protein, but not cIAP-1 and cIAP-2. The combination of simvastatin and 10 \u03bcM LY294002 (non-toxic dose) augmented apoptosis significantly, as evidenced by cleavage of PARP. The immunoreactive band of survivin was markedly decreased in cells treated with 50 \u03bcM LY294002 (toxic dose) as well as by the combination of simvastatin and 10 \u03bcM LY294002. Moreover, survivin down-regulation by RNA interference induced apoptosis accompanied by an increase in hypodiploid DNA content. Taken together, these data suggest that the anti-cancer effect of simvastatin via induction of apoptosis is related to Akt signaling dependent down-regulation of survivin in lung cancer A549 cells.", 
    "42": "Contemporary clinical decision making is well supported by a wide variety of information sources, including clinical practice guidelines, position papers, and insights from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Much of our fundamental understanding of cardiovascular risk factors is based on multiple observations from major epidemiologic studies, such as The Seven Country Studies and the US-based Framingham Heart Study. These studies provided the framework for the development of clinical practice guidelines, including the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel series. The objective of this article is to highlight the value of observational studies as a complement to clinical trial data for clinical decision making in real-world practice. Although RCTs are still the benchmark for assessing clinical efficacy and safety of a specific therapeutic approach, they may be of limited utility to practitioners who must then adapt the lessons learned from the trial into the patient care environment. The use of well-structured observational studies can improve our understanding of the translation of clinical trials into clinical practice, as demonstrated here with the example of statins. Although such studies have their own limitations, improved techniques for design and analysis have reduced the impact of bias and confounders. The introduction of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines has provided more uniformity for such studies. When used together with RCTs, observational studies can enhance our understanding of effectiveness and utility in real-world clinical practice. In the examples of statin observational studies, the results suggest that relative effectiveness of different statins and potential impact of switching statins should be carefully considered in treating individual patients by practicing physicians.",

The incidence of obesity and other components of the metabolic syndrome is now at epidemic proportions, and current lifestyle trends suggest that it will continue to increase worldwide. In order to avert a major health crisis, physicians must take immediate steps to recognize and treat the metabolic syndrome and its components. Early diagnosis and therapeutic lifestyle changes should go hand-in-hand with individual and composite therapy for metabolic syndrome components to reduce CVD risk in affected individuals. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the diagnosis and treatment of the metabolic syndrome with a particular emphasis on reducing CVD risk.", 
    "44": "Smooth muscle cells promote fibroproliferative airway remodeling in asthma, and transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) is a key inductive signal. Statins are widely used to treat hyperlipidemia. Growing evidence indicates they also exert a positive impact on lung health, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We assessed the effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methlyglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition with simvastatin on the fibrotic function of primary cultured human airway smooth muscle cells. Simvastatin blocked de novo cholesterol synthesis, but total myocyte cholesterol content was unaffected. Simvastatin also abrogated TGF\u03b21-induced collagen I and fibronectin expression, and prevented collagen I secretion. The depletion of mevalonate cascade intermediates downstream from HMG-CoA underpinned the effects of simvastatin, because co-incubation with mevalonate, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, or farnesylpyrophosphate prevented the inhibition of matrix protein expression. We also showed that human airway myocytes express both geranylgeranyl transferase 1 (GGT1) and farnesyltransferase (FT), and the inhibition of GGT1 (GGTI inhibitor-286, 10 \u03bcM), but not FT (FTI inhibitor-277, 10 \u03bcM), mirrored the suppressive effects of simvastatin on collagen I and fibronectin expression and collagen I secretion. Moreover, simvastatin and GGTI-286 both prevented TGF\u03b21-induced membrane association of RhoA, a downstream target of GGT1. Our findings suggest that simvastatin and GGTI-286 inhibit synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins by human airway smooth muscle cells by suppressing GGT1-mediated posttranslational modification of signaling molecules such as RhoA. These findings reveal mechanisms related to evidence for the positive impact of statins on pulmonary health.", 
    "45": "Statins decrease apoB-100-containing lipoproteins by increasing their fractional catabolic rates through LDL receptor-mediated uptake. Their influence on hepatic secretion of these lipoproteins is controversial. The objective of the study was to examine the influence of simvastatin on the secretion of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins in fasting non-obese subjects. Turnover of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins was investigated using stable isotope-labeled tracers. Multicompartmental modeling was used to derive kinetic parameters. Eight male subjects (BMI 25 +/- 3 kg/m(2)) with mild hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol 135 +/- 30 mg/dL) and normal triglycerides (111 +/- 44 mg/dL) were examined under no treatment (A), under chronic treatment with simvastatin 40 mg/day (B) and after an acute-on-chronic dosage of 80 mg simvastatin under chronic simvastatin treatment (C). Lipoprotein concentrations changed as expected under 40 mg/day simvastatin. Fractional catabolic rates increased in IDL and LDL but not in VLDL fractions versus control [VLDL +35% in B (n.s.) and +21% in C (n.s.); IDL +169% in B (P = 0.08) and +187% in C (P = 0.032); LDL +87% in B (P = 0.025) and +133% in C (P = 0.025)]. Chronic (B) and acute-on-chronic simvastatin treatment (C) did not affect lipoprotein production rates [VLDL -8 and -13%, IDL +47 and +38%, and LDL +19 and +30% in B and C, respectively (all comparisons n.s.)]. The data indicate that simvastatin does not influence the secretion of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins in non-obese subjects with near-normal LDL cholesterol concentrations.", 
    "46": "Statins are effective drugs for treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Besides their lipid-lowering properties, statins act through multiple pleiotropic effects including vasoprotective mechanisms, effects on coagulation, anti-inflammatory properties and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. In recent years many studies have investigated the effects of statins administered to patients in the perioperative period. Results indicate that the perioperative use of statins is beneficial, most of all for patients with a high cardiovascular risk profile. However, most study designs are retrospective and vulnerable to systematic bias. The number of randomized controlled trials is very limited and include only low numbers of patients. Currently it is not known when perioperative treatment with statin should be started and how long it should be continued postoperatively to reach optimal protective effects. A pre-existing statin therapy should be continued perioperatively because discontinuation leads to a higher rate of complications in the perioperative period. Larger randomized controlled trials are therefore necessary to evaluate the efficiency and the safety of perioperative statin use, especially for patients with a low or intermediate cardiovascular risk profile.",

These have rarely been analyzed simultaneously in the same experimental setting, with virtually no studies of primary human hepatocytes. This study analyzed the efficacy of rosuvastatin in the coordinated regulation of a number of genes implicated in cholesterol metabolism in primary human hepatocytes. Expression of five cholesterol-related genes were significantly upregulated, notably the Niemann-Pick C1 like 1 protein, for whom functional studies have been essentially limited to the intestine. Two genes were significantly downregulated, including sterol recognition element binding protein-1 gene that is implicated in control of hepatic lipogenesis. The results show the coordinated regulation of several genes implicated in hepatic cholesterol homeostasis and suggest therapeutic targets that could complement that clinical action of statins.",

Many severe ADRs appear to be idiosyncratic and unpredictable. Genetic factors may underlie susceptibility to severe ADRs, and identification of predisposing genotypes may improve drug therapy by facilitating prescreening of carriers for specific genetic biomarkers. In this review, we clarify the current status of ADRs in Japan from open ADR data sources. Then, we introduce recent progress in the field of pharmacogenetic biomarkers for severe cutaneous ADRs, liver injury, and statin-induced myopathy.

Psoriasis severity was evaluated with PASI scale, quality of life with DLQI, PDI and SF 36 questionnaires. Degree of systemic inflammation (IL 10, TNF , hsCRP) and local (TNF , rc TNF , LFA 1) systemic immune inflammation was also assessed. Patients were randomized into either atorvastatin group (20 mg/day, n=48) or standard therapy group (n=15). Initially there was no significant difference between groups in psoriasis severity (PASI 22.2 [13.3; 24.6]) and 22.6 [19.3; 23.6], respectively). Six months of therapy with atorvastatin resulted in significant lowering of PASI (3.6 [1.6;4.8]) compared with 17.0 [15.0; 20.1] in control group, p0.01]); 47.9% of patients achieved PASI -50% in 3 weeks and 95.8% - after 6 months of therapy (0% and 13.3% in control group); 81.3% of patients achieved level of PASI -75% by 6th month of treatment. Positive dynamics of therapy was accompanied with significant improvement of quality of life according to data of PDI and DLQI. After 3 weeks of therapy significant lowering of TNF (from 1.45 [0.6; 1.8] to 1.0 [0.6; 1.4], p<0.05) and hs-CRP (from 5.4 [2.4; 7.1] to 3.3 [2.9; 5.5], p<0.05) took place in atorvastatin group.

The animals were sacrificed after 30 or 60 days. The skulls were removed, and radiographic densitometry and histometric analyses of the bone defect area were performed. Local crust formation was clinically verified in SIM-1 and SIM-2 animals. After statistical analysis (p<0.05) of bone area data, we observed no significant differences among the groups after 30 days. After 60 days, however, there was less bone formation in the CAR and SIM-2 groups. The SIM-2 group also presented with lower radiographic densities after 60 days.

This study investigated whether lovastatin perturbs cytoskeletons and cell morphology by RhoA suppression in peritoneal Met5A cells. Subcellular distributions of RhoA protein and actin were assessed by immunocytochemical staining. Exposure to lovastatin caused actin filament reorganisation, decrease in the active (membrane-bound) form of RhoA and subsequently cellular shrinkage in Met5A cells. These lovastatin-induced changes were significantly overcome by the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (downstream intermediate of HMG-CoA pathway). A RhoA protein inhibitor C3 transferase mimicked the effects of lovastatin on the Met5A cells. The effects of lovastatin on cytoskeleton alterations were correlated well with inhibition of the membrane localisation of RhoA. These results suggest that lovastatin induced reversible cytoskeleton reorganisation and cellular retraction through the reduction of RhoA geranylgeranylation, which in turn suppressed RhoA signalling-associated cellular events.",

    "88": "When cholesterol levels remain high despite appropriate lifestyle measures, the choice of lipid-lowering drug should focus on products that have been shown to prevent fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. On this basis, simvastatin and pravastatin, unlike sustained-release nicotinic acid, are first-line options. A fixed-dose combination of nicotinic acid and laropiprant is authorised in the European Union for the treatment of lipid disorders, either alone or together with a statin. The role of laropiprant, a type 1 prostaglandin D2 receptor antagonist, is to prevent the flushing caused by nicotinic acid. The nicotinic acid + laropiprant combination, used alone or simultaneously with a statin, has only been tested for its effect on surrogate lipid endpoints, not for its ability to prevent cardiovascular events. Three comparative trials in a total of about 4000 patients showed that laropiprant partly prevented the flushing due to sustained-release nicotinic acid. However, about one in three patients still had at least moderately intense flushing at the outset of treatment, while about half the patients subsequently had flushing on up to 3 days a week. Compared with sustained-release nicotinic acid alone, laropiprant + nicotinic acid combination therapy provokes more gastrointestinal disorders, more hypersensitivity reactions, and more transaminase and creatine phosphokinase elevations. Through its effect on prostaglandin D2 and thromboxane A2, laropiprant also has effects on blood coagulation, with uncertain clinical consequences. Animal and human data argue against the use of the nicotinic acid + laropiprant combination during pregnancy and breast-feeding. In practice, patients with hypercholesterolaemia need drugs with well-documented clinical efficacy, and this excludes the nicotinic acid + laropiprant combination.",

We evaluated the effect of in-hospital initiation of LLT on the clinical outcomes of patients with stroke. The Taiwan Stroke Registry prospectively collected data from patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. By July 31, 2008, 16,704 adult patients without previous LLT had been admitted and survived to discharge. The study end point was the composite outcome of recurrent stroke, ischemic heart disease, and all-cause death. We examined the effect of LLT at discharge on the clinical outcomes of these patients. A propensity analysis was done to adjust for selection biases in the prescription of LLT. At discharge, 4,032 patients (24%) had received LLT. At 6 months, 206 patients (5.1%) in the LLT group and 964 patients (7.6%) in the non-LLT group had developed > or =1 component of the composite end point (p <0.0001).

    "114": "Obesity and hypertension are associated with left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Whether an increased body mass index (BMI) affects LV hypertrophy in patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis independent of hypertension is not known. We used the clinical blood pressure, BMI, and echocardiographic findings recorded at baseline of 1,703 patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) participating in the Simvastatin Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study. The patient population was divided into 3 BMI classes: normal BMI, 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m(2); overweight, BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m(2); and obese, BMI > or =30.0 kg/m(2). For the total study population, the average blood pressure was 145/82 +/- 20/10 mm Hg, age 67 +/- 10 years, BMI 26.9 +/- 4.3 kg/m(2), and peak transaortic velocity 3.1 +/- 0.5 m/s. The prevalence of hypertension increased with increasing BMI class (43% vs 51% and 63%, p <0.01). The LV mass and prevalence of LV hypertrophy increased with an increasing BMI (22% in normal, 38% in overweight, and 54% in obese patients). The LV ejection fraction and stress-corrected mid-wall fractional shortening decreased (p <0.01 vs normal-weight group). On multiple logistic regression analysis, the presence of LV hypertrophy was associated with a greater BMI (odds ratio 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.18), independent of a history of hypertension, the severity of AS, older age, systolic blood pressure, and lower LV ejection fraction (all p <0.05).

Subjects (n = 256 randomized) received double-blind P-OM3 4 g/day or placebo for 8 weeks combined with diet and open-label simvastatin 40 mg/day. The percentage of changes from baseline (with diet plus simvastatin) in lipids was evaluated by tertiles of baseline LDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. The baseline LDL cholesterol tertile was a significant predictor of the LDL cholesterol response (p = 0.022 for the treatment by baseline tertile interaction). The median LDL cholesterol response in the P-OM3 group was +9.5% (first tertile, <80.4 mg/dl), -0.9% (second tertile), and -6.4% (third tertile, > or =99.0 mg/dl). Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride responses did not vary significantly by baseline LDL cholesterol tertile. The reductions in very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were greater than the increases in LDL cholesterol, where present, resulting in a net decrease in the concentration of cholesterol carried by atherogenic particles (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) in all baseline LDL cholesterol tertiles. In conclusion, these results suggest that the increase in LDL cholesterol that occurred with the addition of P-OM3 to simvastatin therapy in subjects with mixed dyslipidemia was confined predominantly to those with low LDL cholesterol levels while receiving simvastatin monotherapy.", 
    "116": "Numerous epidemiological and prospective studies have shown a direct relationship between total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular disease (cardiovascular morbidity and mortality). In many intervention studies with more than 100,000 subjects, statins have shown a powerful and significant reduction of cardiovascular events and a decrease in cardiovascular and overall mortality, far superior to those produced by any other lipid-lowering group. Consequently statins are considered to be safe and well tolerated and are the first choice in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and in cardiovascular disease prevention. If targets are not reached, other pharmacological groups must be associated (resins, nicotinic acid, ezetimibe, fibrates, etc.). Moreover, when hypercholesterolemia is associated with low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and high triglyceride levels, the association of statins with nicotinic acid, fibrates or omega-3 should be considered. Some questions remain to be answered: what LDL-C levels are desirable in secondary prevention? Which individuals might benefit from treatment in primary prevention? Which lipid-lowering drug is the most suitable to combine with statins and diminish cardiovascular risk in each situation? The present article reviews these important points.", 
    "117": "Simple, accurate and precise colorimetric method for the determination of simvastatin and lovastatin in tablets is described. The method is based on the reaction of simvastatin or lovastatin with hydroxylamine in alkaline medium to form the corresponding hydroxamic acid derivatives which, on treatment with ferric ion in acid medium, yield highly colored ferric-chelate complex with maximum absorption at 513nm. Beer's law is obeyed in the concentration ranges 0.04-0.4mgml(-1) for both simvastatin and lovastatin, respectively. Molar absorptivity values, as calculated from Beer's law data, were found to be 1.15x10(3) and 1.09x10(3)lmol(-1)cm(-1) for simvastatin and lovastatin, respectively. Optimal experimental parameters for the reaction have been studied. The validity of the described procedures was assessed.

Adult male rats were subjected to 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and treated with or without Niaspan alone, Simvastatin alone and combination Niaspan and Simvastatin starting 24 h after MCAo and daily for 14 days. Neurological functional tests were performed. Axonal damage and density were evaluated by Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and Bielschowsky silver, respectively. Nogo66 Receptor (NgR) expression and immunoreactive microglia (Iba-1) were also measured in the ischemic brain. Niaspan and Simvastatin monotherapy and combination treatment significantly promote functional outcome after stroke (p<0.05) compared to MCAo control animals. Combination treatment with Niaspan and Simvastatin induces additive but not synergetic effects when compared to Niaspan or Simvastatin monotherapy groups. Combination treatment significantly decreased APP expression and increased Bielschowsky silver expression. NGR and Iba-1 expression were significantly decreased in the ischemic brain. These data suggest that treatment of experimental stroke with combination of Niaspan and Simvastatin significantly improves functional outcome, reduces axonal damage and increases axonal density. Decreased expression of the NGR and reduced activated microglia may contribute to functional recovery after stroke.", 
    "119": "Prospective studies of coronary heart disease patients with disorders of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), have shown that these patients usually display high levels of low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL-P) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein particles (HDL-P). In multiple prospective studies, high levels of LDL-P are more predictive of CHD risk than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The conventional goal of lipid lowering treatment is to lower LDL-C levels; however LDL-C is unrelated to the severity of insulin resistance. Among high cardiometabolic risk patients with LDL-C <100 mg/dL, about two-thirds of patients have a high LDL-P (>1000 nmol/L) despite this \"optimal\" level of LDL-C. For high cardiometabolic risk patients, LDL-P should be considered a primary goal of therapy due to its stronger association with cardiovascular risk. Further, we propose that certain lipid-altering therapies may be particularly useful in reducing cardiovascular events in statin-treated patients, not simply due to their improvement in LDL-C goal attainment, but due to their effects on lowering the number of low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL-P).",

This paper reviews major interactions between statins and dietary compounds. Consumption of pectin or oat bran together with Lovastatin reduces absorption of the drug, while alcohol intake does not appear to affect the efficacy and safety of Fluvastatin treatment. Grapefruit juice components inhibit cytochrome P-4503A4, reducing the presystemic metabolism of drugs such as Simvastatin, Lovastatin and Atorvastatin. Follow-up studies on the therapeutic effect of statins in patients consuming a Mediterranean-style diet are necessary to assure the correct prescription because the oil-statin and minor oil compound-statin possible interactions have been only briefly studied. Preliminary study suggests that olive oil can increase the hypolipaemiant effect of Simvastatin with respect sunflower oil. The consumption of polyunsaturated rich oils, throughout the cytochrome P- 450 activation could decrease the half-life of some statins and therefore their hypolipaemic effects. The statins and n-3 fatty acids combined therapy gives rise to pharmacodinamic interaction that improves the lipid profile and leads greater cardioprotection. Although statins are more effective in high endogenous cholesterol production subjects and plant sterols are more effective in high cholesterol absorption efficacy subjects, plant esterols-statins combined therapy generates very positive complementary effects. This review ends suggesting possible diet-stain interactions that require further investigations (e.g. types of olive oils, fruit juices other than grapefruit, fibre or consumption of alcoholic beverages rich in polyphenols or ethanol).",

This article explores the evidence for statins as novel therapy in community acquired pneumonia. Experimental and animal studies suggest statins attenuate acute lung injury by modulating neutrophil function, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release and reducing vascular leak. Statins reduce endothelial dysfunction and have anti-thrombotic effects that improve outcome from pneumonia and sepsis in animal models. Clinical studies have provided conflicting results, but many suggest that statins may have a role in preventing pneumonia, or improving prognosis in hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia.",

Other effects, including reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP), also contribute to treatment response. Metabolomics provides powerful tools to map pathways implicated in variation in response to statin treatment. This could lead to mechanistic hypotheses that provide insight into the underlying basis for individual variation in drug response. Using a targeted lipidomics platform, we defined lipid changes in blood samples from the upper and lower tails of the LDL-C response distribution in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics study. Metabolic changes in responders are more comprehensive than those seen in non-responders. Baseline cholesterol ester and phospholipid metabolites correlated with LDL-C response to treatment. CRP response to therapy correlated with baseline plasmalogens, lipids involved in inflammation. There was no overlap of lipids whose changes correlated with LDL-C or CRP responses to simvastatin suggesting that distinct metabolic pathways govern statin effects on these two biomarkers.

Collaboration is in the best interests of patients and society if it accelerates the translation of basic science discoveries to new medicines that address unmet medical needs.", 
    "149": "Myopathy occurs in approximately 10% of statin-treated patients and is most commonly manifested by myalgias with or without plasma creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Predisposition exists in patients treated with high doses of potent statins and those who are older, female, have a genetic predisposition, and when statins are coadministered with drugs that compete with or inhibit drug metabolism. In symptomatic patients, CK levels may assist in guiding management. If less than five times the upper limit of normal, the existing statin should be titrated to achieve cholesterol goals and the CK repeated when symptoms appear or worsen. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms and any patient with CK elevated to more than 5-fold the upper limit of normal, the statin should be stopped. Once asymptomatic and CK is reduced (if elevated previously), cholesterol goals can be approached by: 1) a different statin (e.g. fluvastatin or pravastatin), starting with a low dose and titrating up; 2) an alternate daily or weekly more potent statin (e.g. rosuvastatin or atorvastatin); or 3) the combination of the lowest tolerated statin with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) and/or bile acid sequestrant. Over-the-counter preparations, e.g. red yeast rice, containing natural statin-like agents, or plant sterols can also lower cholesterol. These, however, have limited efficacy to achieve targeted cholesterol levels for most patients. In patients without CK elevations and symptoms, progress can be followed clinically, but in patients who show CK elevations, CK should be monitored. At present, the superiority of one approach has not been demonstrated, and the need for clinical trials in well-characterized patients with statin intolerance cannot be dismissed.",

Individual texture features were compared to the previously determined changes in VW volume (VWV) using the distance between classes, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and accuracy of the classifiers. Texture features that resulted in maximal classification accuracy from each texture technique were selected using Pudil's sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) as a method of ranking each technique.

Diabetic nephropathy results from complex interactions between genetic, metabolic and hemodynamic factors. Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrosis associated with diabetic kidney disease have led to the identification of several novel targets for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Albuminuria is a useful clinical marker of diabetic nephropathy, as it can be used to predict a decline in renal function. A reduction in albuminuria might not, however, be reflective of a protective effect of therapies focused on ameliorating renal fibrosis. Although new strategies for slowing down the progression of several types of renal disease have emerged, the challenge of arresting the relentless progression of diabetic nephropathy remains. In this Review, we discuss novel pharmacological approaches that aim to improve the renal outcomes of diabetic nephropathy, including the use of direct renin inhibitors and statins. We also discuss the promise of using antifibrotic agents to treat diabetic nephropathy. The need for novel biomarkers of diabetic nephropathy is also highlighted.",

    "173": "The transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is required for the quiescent and migratory properties of naive T cells. Statins, a class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, display pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects that are independent of their lipid-lowering capacity and may be beneficial as therapeutic agents for T cell-mediated inflammatory diseases. Statins upregulate KLF2 expression in endothelial cells, and this activity is associated with an antiinflammatory phenotype. We therefore hypothesized that the immunomodulatory effects of statins are due, in part, to their direct effects on T cell KLF2 gene expression. Here we report that lipophilic statin treatment of mouse and human T cells increased expression of KLF2 through a HMG-CoA/prenylation-dependent pathway. Statins also diminished T cell proliferation and IFN-gamma expression. shRNA blockade of KLF2 expression in human T cells increased IFN-gamma expression and prevented statin-induced IFN-gamma reduction. In a mouse model of myocarditis induced by heart antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, both statin treatment of the T cells and retrovirally mediated overexpression of KLF2 in the T cells had similar ameliorating effects on disease induction. We conclude that statins reduce inflammatory functions and pathogenic activity of T cells through KLF2-dependent mechanisms, and this pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases.",

MACE decreased from 7.02% events per patient per year at the start of lipid apheresis to 1.17% during lipid apheresis and the rate of myocardial revascularization decreased from 22.8% to 3.8% per patient per year. Classical (diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and smoking history), as well as novel risk factors (cGFR < 60 mL/min, statin withdrawal, mixed hyperlipoproteinemia, and elevated lipoprotein (a)) were associated with an elevated risk for MACE. All applied methods had comparable effects. All lipid apheresis methods proved to be safe and suitable for long-term treatment.

The mean age at coronary angiography was 52.5+/-7.9 yr with a mean prior transplant duration of 118.1+/-58.8 months. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated a positive correlation of MGI with transplant duration before coronary angiography and chronic allograft nephropathy, whereas an inverse correlation was demonstrated with ejection fraction and statin use. On subsequent multivariate linear regression analysis, transplant duration before coronary angiography, statin use, and ejection fraction were independently associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in long-term kidney transplant patients. In summary, our study demonstrates that statin use, ejection fraction, and transplant duration before coronary angiography are independent parameters associated with the severity of coronary atherosclerosis in long-term kidney transplant patients.

The in situ intestinal absorption indicated that the absorption of SLNs was greatly improved compared with that of free SV, and the absorption was changed with the site of the intestinal segments. SLNs could be uptaken into the enterocytes through both clathrin and caveolae mediated endocytosis pathways. The oral bioavailability of SV after its incorporation into the lipid nanoparticles was improved by 3.37-fold for SLNs I and 2.55-fold for SLNs II compared with that from free SV in rats, and that of the SVA was significantly enhanced as well. As a result, lipid nanoparticles could be a promising delivery system to enhance the oral bioavailability of simvastatin."
