Statin is one of the most widely used medications for hypercholesterolemia. Several meta-analyses have failed to determine the relationship between statins and gastric cancer.", 
    "1": "A meta-analysis of case control studies is conducted to evaluate the association of statin exposure and risk of gastric cancer.", 
    "2": "Eight electronic databases (The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 12, 2012), PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Knowledge, CNKI, CBM, CSJD and Wanfang Database) were searched for relevant publications through September 2013. Two reviewers determined the eligibility of articles and abstracted the data independently. RevMan 5.2 software was used for statistical analysis.", 
    "3": "146 items were retrieved from the databases and 6 studies were identified in this meta-analysis, which included 5,993 cases and 54,800 matched controls. RESULTS from the meta-analysis demonstrated that statins were inversely related to the risk of gastric cancer (RR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.35-0.90). There was no significant difference for cumulative duration of statin exposure and gastric cancer, nor participants from Asia, Europe, or USA.", 
    "4": "This meta-analysis suggests that statins have favorable effects on gastric cancer, rigorously designed and executed observational studies and randomized control trials with longer duration of follow-up are warranted to determine effects in clinical practice.", 
    "5": "As inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, statins are an important first-line treatment for hypercholesterolemia. However, a recognized side-effect of statin therapy is myopathy, which in severe cases can present as potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis. This represents an important impediment to successful statin therapy, and despite decades of research the molecular mechanisms underlying this side-effect remain unclear. Current evidence supports a role for reduced levels of mevalonate pathway intermediates, with the most accepted hypothesis being a reduction in isoprenoids formation, leading to faulty post-translational modifications of membrane-associated proteins. We have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the impact of nine statins on two human cell lines; Huh7 hepatoma and RD rhabdomyosarcoma. In both cell lines, concentration-dependent inhibition of prenylation was observed for cerivastatin and simvastatin, which could be rescued with the pathway intermediate mevalonate; in general, muscle cells were more sensitive to this effect, as measured by the levels of unprenylated Rap1A, a marker for prenylation by geranylgeranyl transferase I. Concentration-dependent toxicity was observed in both cell lines, with muscle cells again being more sensitive. Importantly, there was no correlation between inhibition of prenylation and cell toxicity, suggesting they are not causally linked. The lack of a causal relationship was confirmed by the absence of cytotoxicity in all cell lines following exposure to specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferases I and II, and farnesyl transferase. As such, we provide strong evidence against the commonly accepted hypothesis linking inhibition of prenylation and statin-mediated toxicity, with the two processes likely to be simultaneous but independent.",

    "14": "Although statins, or hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-Co A) reductase inhibitors, are generally used to decrease levels of circulating cholesterol, they have also been reported to have neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms. However, recent results have indicated that they may be harmful in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this study, we investigate whether atorvastatin protects motor neuron-like cells (NSC-34D) from oxidative stress. To evaluate the effects of atorvastatin or hydrogen peroxide or both on NSC-34D cells, the cells were treated with various combinations of these agents. To evaluate the viability of the cells, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and trypan blue staining were performed. Levels of free radicals and intracellular signaling proteins were evaluated using the fluorescent probe 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and Western blotting, respectively. Atorvastatin protected NSC-34D cells against oxidative stress in a concentration-dependent manner. This neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin was blocked by LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor and by FR180204, a selective extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) inhibitor. Atorvastatin treatment increased the expression levels of p85\u03b1PI3K, phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2, phosphorylated ERK, and Bcl-2, which are proteins related to survival. Furthermore, atorvastatin decreased the levels of cytosolic cytochrome C, Bax, cleaved caspase-9, and cleaved caspase-3, which are associated with death in oxidative stress-injured NSC-34D cells. We conclude that atorvastatin has a protective effect against oxidative stress in motor neurons by activating the PI3K and ERK pathways as well as by scavenging free radicals. These findings indicate that statins could help protect motor neurons from oxidative stress.",

However, as medical technology evolves, health outcomes for a number of obesity-related illnesses improve. This article examines whether medical innovation can mitigate the adverse health and spending associated with obesity, using statins as a case study. Because of the relationship between obesity and hypercholesterolaemia, statins play an important role in the medical management of obese individuals and the prevention of costly obesity-related sequelae.", 
    "16": "Using well-recognized estimates of the health impact of statins and the Future Elderly Model (FEM)-an established dynamic microsimulation model of the health of Americans aged over 50\u00a0years-we estimate the changes in life expectancy, functional status and health care costs of obesity due to the introduction and widespread use of statins.", 
    "17": "Life expectancy gains of statins are estimated to be 5-6\u00a0% greater for obese individuals than for healthy-weight individuals, but most of these additional gains are associated with some level of disability. Considering both medical spending and the value of quality-adjusted life-years, statins do not significantly alter the costs of class 1 and\u00a02 obesity (body mass index [BMI] \u226530 and \u226535\u00a0kg/m(2), respectively) and they increase the costs of class\u00a03 obesity (BMI \u226540\u00a0kg/m(2)) by 1.2\u00a0%.",

    "20": "We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL through December 2012, and reviewed published systematic reviews of statin treatment. We sought RCTs that compared statin treatment versus placebo or standard care, and reported at least one cognitive outcome (frequency of adverse cognitive events or measurements using standard neuropsychological cognitive test scores). Studies reporting sufficient information to calculate effect sizes were included in meta-analyses. Standardized and unstandardized mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes for global cognition and for pre-specified cognitive domains. The main outcome was change in cognition measured by neuropsychological tests; an outcome of secondary interest was the frequency of adverse cognitive events observed during follow-up.", 
    "21": "We identified 25 RCTs (all placebo-controlled) reporting cognitive outcomes in 46,836 subjects, of which 23 RCTs reported cognitive test results in 29,012 participants. Adverse cognitive outcomes attributable to statins were rarely reported in trials involving cognitively normal or impaired subjects. Furthermore, meta-analysis of cognitive test data (14 studies; 27,643 participants) failed to show significant adverse effects of statins on all tests of cognition in either cognitively normal subjects (standardized mean difference 0.01, 95% confidence interval, CI, -0.01 to 0.03, p\u2009=\u20090.42) or Alzheimer's disease subjects (standardized mean difference -0.05, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10, p\u2009=\u20090.38).",

    "23": "In heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction, randomized trials of statins did not demonstrate improved outcomes. However, randomized trials may not always be generalizable. The aim was to determine whether statins are associated with improved outcomes in an unselected nationwide population of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction overall and in relation to ischemic heart disease (IHD).", 
    "24": "In the Swedish Heart Failure Registry, 21\u2009864 patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (age \u00b1 SD, 72\u00b112 years; 29% women), of whom 10\u2009345 (47%) were treated with statins, were studied. Propensity scores for statin use were derived from 42 baseline variables. The associations between statin use and outcomes were assessed with Cox regressions in a population matched 1:1 based on propensity score and age and in the overall population with adjustment for propensity score and age. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality; HF hospitalization; and combined all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization. Survival at 1 year in the matched population was 83% for statin-treated versus 79% for untreated patients (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.86; P<0.001). In the unmatched population, 1-year survival was 85% for statin-treated versus 79% for untreated patients, hazard ratio after adjustment for propensity score and age was 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.89; P<0.001). No examined baseline variables interacted with statin use except for IHD (P=0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.82, P<0.001) with IHD and 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.07; P=0.430 without IHD. Statin use was also associated with reduced risk for all 3 secondary outcomes.", 
    "25": "In an unselected nationwide population of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, statins were associated with improved outcomes, specifically in the presence of IHD. This contrasts with previous randomized controlled trials. Additional randomized controlled trials with more generalized inclusion or focused on IHD may be warranted.", 
    "26": "Statins represent the elective lipid-lowering strategy in hyperlipidemic and high cardiovascular-risk patients. Despite excellent safety and tolerability, reversible muscle-related and dose-dependent adverse events may decrease a patient's compliance. Large meta-analyses, post-hoc and genetic studies showed that statins might increase the risk of new-onset diabetes (NOD), particularly in insulin-resistant, obese, old patients. Race, gender, concomitant medication, dose and treatment duration may also contribute to this effect. Based on this evidence, to warn against the possibility of statin-induced NOD or worsening glycemic control in patients with already established diabetes, FDA and EMA changed the labels of all the available statins in the USA and Europe. Recent meta-analyses and retrospective studies demonstrated that statins' diabetogenicity is a dose-related class effect, but the mechanism(s) is not understood. Among statins, only pravastatin and pitavastatin do not deteriorate glycemic parameters in patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, available data, obtained in small-scale, retrospective or single-center clinical studies, document that pitavastatin, while ameliorating lipid profile, seems protective against NOD. Beyond differences in pharmacokinetics between pitavastatin and the other statins (higher oral bioavailability, lower hepatic uptake), its consistent increases in plasma adiponectin documented in clinical studies may be causally connected with its effect on glucose metabolism. Adiponectin is a protein with antiatherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory and antidiabetogenic properties exerted on liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and pancreatic beta cells. Further studies are required to confirm this unique property of pitavastatin and to understand the mechanism(s) leading to this effect.", 
    "27": "This retrospective study was designed to assess statin effects on T-cell activation from HIV-infected individuals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from antiretroviral therapy suppressed HIV-infected individuals receiving atorvastatin or pravastatin were evaluated for T-cell activation, exhaustion and function. Atorvastatin was associated with a significant reduction in CD8 T-cell activation (HLA-DR, CD38/HLA-DR) and exhaustion (TIM-3, TIM-3/PD-1) whereas pravastatin had no effect. In contrast, pravastatin increased antigen specific interferon \u03b3 production. These results suggest a differential effect of statins on immune activation and function.",

While median suPAR level was not significantly different in patients with different cardiovascular risk factors, patients on statin therapy had significantly higher suPAR level (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). SuPAR correlated negatively with CFR and, after multivariate adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors, medications profiles and hs-CRP, suPAR remained an independent predictor of CFR (B\u00a0=\u00a0-0.30, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), indicating an independent association between suPAR level and coronary microvascular function.",

Adults hospitalised for laboratory-confirmed influenza (prospectively diagnosed) during 2008-2011 were studied. The primary outcome measure was 30-day survival. Multivariate Cox regression models (time-fixed and time-dependent) were used. Patients had high morbidity (respiratory/nonrespiratory complications in 68.4%, respiratory failure in 48.6%, pneumonia in 40.8% and bacterial superinfections in 10.8%) and mortality (5.9% at 30\u2005days and 6.9% at 60\u2005days). 75.2% received neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) (73.8% received oseltamivir and 1.4% received peramivir/zanamivir; 44.5% of patients received NAI \u22642\u2005days and 65.5% \u22645\u2005days after onset of illness); 23.1% received systemic corticosteroids. There were fewer deaths among NAI-treated patients (5.3% versus 7.6%; p=0.032). NAI treatment was independently associated with survival (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.43), adjusted for treatment-propensity score and patient characteristics. Superinfections increased (adjusted HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.52-3.11) and chronic statin use decreased (adjusted HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.23-0.84) death risks. Best survival was shown when treatment started within \u22642\u2005days (adjusted HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.12-0.32), but there was benefit with treatment within 3-5\u2005days (adjusted HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.21-0.58). Time-dependent analysis showed consistent results of NAI treatment (adjusted HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.27-0.57). Corticosteroids increased superinfection (9.7% versus 2.7%) and deaths when controlled for indications (adjusted HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.14-2.62). Early NAI treatment was associated with shorter length of stay in a subanalysis. NAI treatment may improve survival of hospitalised influenza patients; benefit is greatest from, but not limited to, treatment started within 2\u2005days of illness. Superinfections and corticosteroids increase mortality. Antiviral and non-antiviral management strategies should be considered.",

When co-administered with simvastatin, clarithromycin can significantly increase simvastatin plasma concentration levels, thereby, increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. At present, pharmacokinetic data of the interaction between both drugs are available. However, they are being used for semi-quantitative application only, not for quantitative prediction. We aimed to develop a mathematical model describing a drug-drug interaction between simvastatin and clarithromycin in humans.",

The development of calibration models for each compound was based on a D-optimal experimental design consisting of 63 standard mixtures containing LPC, CHO and SIM in chloroform. For each compound, different spectral pretreatment methods were applied in association with selected spectral regions. Partial least-square regression (PLS) was performed using OPUS 6.5 software. Calibration set and cross-validation was carried out in order to select the best model to be used further. Straight line subtraction (SLS) was the best pre-treatment method for each compound, although the selected spectral regions were different. The method developed for each compound was validated in terms of linearity, trueness, precision and accuracy. Finally, the method has been successfully used for simultaneous quantification of SIM and excipients in liposomes. The encapsulation efficiency of SIM determined by this method was similar with that obtained by the use of reference HPLC method.",

This large scale population-based study aimed to investigate the effect hyperlipidemia and the use of statins in patients with lumbar spine injury. The National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan was used to identify patients with lumbar spine injury. A total of 2844 patients were grouped into three: no hyperlipidemia, hyperlipidemia using low-dose of statins (\u226490 of the defined daily dosage (DDD)), and severe hyperlipidemia using high-dose of statins (>90 DDD). A Cox multiple regression model was used to compare the incidence rates of disability among the three groups. The results showed that patients with hyperlipidemia appeared a higher risk of permanent disability (adjusted HR = 1.38, p = 0.28). In subgroup analysis, patients with severe hyperlipidemia had a higher risk of disability (adjusted HR = 3.1, p < 0.004), whereas hyperlipidemia using low-dose statins had a similar risk of permanently disability (adjusted HR = 0.83, p = 0.661). Hyperlipidemia adversely affected the neurological outcomes of lumbar spinal injury. Statins may have the potential to reverse this higher risk of disability. However, this beneficiary effect of statins only existed in patients using a lower dose (\u226490 DDD).",

    "70": "Although statins remain the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for reducing the burden of atherosclerotic vascular disease, their administration has been associated with muscle-related adverse effects, including myalgia and rhabdomyolysis. Such adverse events are probably due to reduced antioxidant defenses associated with fewer intermediate metabolites in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. We hypothesize that the concomitant inhibition of xanthine oxidase via coadministration of allopurinol with statins could diminish reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related muscle damage, which would have in turn have positive effects on both the incidence of muscle-related adverse events and cardiovascular outcomes. Accordingly, inhibition of xanthine oxidase has been previously shown to be effective for reducing biomarkers of muscle damage following exercise in professional athletes. Because of the widespread statin utilization and increasing trends in their therapeutic use in atherosclerotic vascular diseases, the proposed strategy could have important clinical implications for reducing statin-induced myalgia and rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "71": "Resistance to chemotherapy is a major problem in the treatment of urothelial bladder cancer. Several mechanisms have been identified in resistance to doxorubicin by analysis of resistant urothelial carcinoma (UC) cell lines, prominently activation of drug efflux pumps and diminished apoptosis. We have derived a new doxorubicin-resistant cell line from BFTC-905 UC cells, designated BFTC-905-DOXO-II. A doxorubicin-responsive green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter assay indicated that resistance in BFTC-905-DOXO-II was not due to increased drug efflux pump activity, whereas caspase-3/7 activation was indeed diminished. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed changes in proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes, but additionally induction of the mevalonate (cholesterol) biosynthetic pathway. Treatment with simvastatin restored sensitivity of BFTC-905-DOXO-II to doxorubicin to that of the parental cell line. Induction of the mevalonate pathway has been reported as a mechanism of chemoresistance in other cancers; this is the first observation in bladder cancer. Combinations of statins with doxorubicin-containing chemotherapy regimens may provide a therapeutic advantage in such cases.",

Besides their lipid-lowering activity, pleiotropic effects on neuronal survival, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis have been described. In view of these observations, we were interested whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in the post-acute stroke phase promotes neurological recovery, peri-lesional, and contralesional neuronal plasticity. We examined effects of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin (0.2 or 2.0\u2009mg/kg/day i.c.v.), administered starting 3\u2009days after 30\u2009min of middle cerebral artery occlusion for 30\u2009days. Here, we show that rosuvastatin treatment significantly increased the grip strength and motor coordination of animals, promoted exploration behavior, and reduced anxiety. It was associated with structural remodeling of peri-lesional brain tissue, reflected by increased neuronal survival, enhanced capillary density, and reduced striatal and corpus callosum atrophy. Increased sprouting of contralesional pyramidal tract fibers crossing the midline in order to innervate the ipsilesional red nucleus was noticed in rosuvastatin compared with vehicle-treated mice, as shown by anterograde tract tracing experiments. Western blot analysis revealed that the abundance of HMG-CoA reductase was increased in the contralesional hemisphere at 14 and 28\u2009days post-ischemia. Our data support the idea that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition promotes brain remodeling and plasticity far beyond the acute stroke phase, resulting in neurological recovery.",

In addition, the administration of combination antiretroviral therapy is associated with an increase in the incidence of metabolic risk factors (insulin resistance, lipoatrophy, dyslipidemia, and abnormalities of fat distribution in HIV patients). HIV dyslipidemia is a common problem, and associated with an increase in incidence of cardiovascular disease. Further challenges in the management of HIV dyslipidemia are the presence of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease, the risk of diabetes associated with statin administration, age and ethnicity, and early menopause in females. Dyslipidemia in patients with HIV is different from the normal population, due to the fact that HIV increases insulin resistance and HIV treatment not only may induce dyslipidemia but also may interact with lipid-lowering medication. The use of all statins (apart from simvastatin and lovastatin) is safe and effective in HIV dyslipidemia, and the addition of ezetimibe, fenofibrate, fish oil, and niacin can be used in statin-unresponsive HIV dyslipidemia. The management of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease risks associated with HIV is complex, and a certain number of patients may require management in specialist clinics run by specialist physicians in lipid disorders. Future research is needed to address best strategies in the management of hyperlipidemia with HIV infection.",

CAD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and treating these patients is challenging. The risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, or fluid retention with some diabetes medications should be considered when developing a treatment plan for individuals with a history of CAD or at risk for CAD. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are oral antihyperglycemic agents that inhibit the breakdown of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, resulting in increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon secretion. Saxagliptin is a potent and selective dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor that improves glycemic control and is generally well tolerated when used as monotherapy and as add-on therapy to other antihyperglycemic medications. This review summarizes findings from recently published post hoc analyses of saxagliptin clinical trials that have been conducted in patients with and without a history of cardiovascular disease and in patients with and without various risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The results show that saxagliptin was generally well tolerated and consistently improved glycemic control, as assessed by reductions from baseline in glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose concentration, and postprandial glucose concentration, regardless of the presence or absence of baseline cardiovascular disease, hypertension, statin use, number of cardiovascular risk factors, or high Framingham 10-year cardiovascular risk score.",

It encompasses structural alterations in the vessel wall, degenerating capillaries (string vessels), vascular fibrosis and calcification, features recapitulated in transgenic mice that overexpress transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF mice). We recently found that simvastatin rescued A\u03b2-mediated cerebrovascular and cognitive deficits in a transgenic mouse model of AD. However, whether simvastatin can counteract A\u03b2-independent deficits remains unknown. Here, we evaluated the effects of simvastatin in aged TGF mice on cerebrovascular reactivity and structure, and on cognitive performance. Simvastatin restored baseline levels of nitric oxide (NO), NO-, and KATP channel-mediated dilations and endothelin-1-induced contractions. Simvastatin significantly reduced vasculopathy with arteriogenic remodeling and string vessel pathology in TGF mice. In contrast, simvastatin did not lessen gliosis, and the cerebrovascular levels of pro-fibrotic proteins and calcification markers remained elevated after treatment. The TGF mice displayed subtle cognitive decline that was not affected by simvastatin. Our results show potent benefits of simvastatin on endothelial- and smooth muscle cell-mediated vasomotor responses, endothelial NO synthesis and in preserving capillary integrity. We conclude that simvastatin could be indicated in the treatment of cerebrovascular dysfunction associated with VaD and AD.",

The SLCO1B1*5 variant is a risk factor for statin side effects and exhibits statin-specific effects: highest with simvastatin/atorvastatin and lowest with pravastatin/rosuvastatin. The effects of SLCO1B1*5 genotype guided statin therapy (GGST) are unknown. Primary care patients (n = 58) who were nonadherent to statins and their providers received SLCO1B1*5 genotyping and guided recommendations via the electronic medical record (EMR). The primary outcome was the change in Beliefs about Medications Questionnaire, which measured patients' perceived needs for statins and concerns about adverse effects, measured before and after SLCO1B1*5 results. Concurrent controls (n = 59) were identified through the EMR to compare secondary outcomes: new statin prescriptions, statin utilization, and change in LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c). GGST patients had trends (p = 0.2) towards improved statin necessity and concerns. The largest changes were the \"need for statin to prevent sickness\" (p < 0.001) and \"concern for statin to disrupt life\" (p = 0.006).

    "93": "Hypertension causes target organ damage (TOD) that involves vasculature, heart, brain and kidneys. Complex biochemical, hormonal and hemodynamic mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of TOD. Common to all these processes is an increased bioavailability of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both in vitro and in vivo studies explored the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress as a mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of TOD in hypertension, especially focusing on atherosclerosis, heart disease, renal failure, cerebrovascular disease. Both dysfunction of mitochondrial proteins, such as uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), superoxide dismutase (SOD) 2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1-\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), calcium channels, and the interaction between mitochondria and other sources of ROS, such as NADPH oxidase, play an important role in the development of endothelial dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, renal and cerebral damage in hypertension. Commonly used anti-hypertensive drugs have shown protective effects against mitochondrial-dependent oxidative stress. Notably, few mitochondrial proteins can be considered therapeutic targets on their own. In fact, antioxidant therapies specifically targeted at mitochondria represent promising strategies to reduce mitochondrial dysfunction and related hypertensive TOD. In the present article, we discuss the role of mitochondrial oxidative stress as a contributing factor to hypertensive TOD development. We also provide an overview of mitochondria-based treatment strategies that may reveal useful to prevent TOD and reduce its progression.", 
    "94": "Recent cardiovascular prevention guidelines place a greater emphasis on randomized placebo-controlled trial data as the basis for recommendations. While such trial data are sparse for people over the age of 75 or 80 years, data demonstrate altered risk-benefit relationships in these older patients. Primary prevention strategy decisions should consider estimated life expectancy and overall function as well as cardiovascular event risks, magnitude and time to benefit or harm, potentially altered adverse effect profiles, and informed patient preferences. Data support treatment of systolic hypertension to reduce stroke, cardiovascular events, and dementia in older patients with at least a 2-year estimated lifespan with modifications in systolic blood pressure goals and a need for greater attention to non-cardiovascular side effects such as falls in the very old. Lowering of elevated cholesterol levels with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for primary prevention in people over the age of 75 years requires greater individual considerations, as benefits may not accrue for 3-5 years and there is the potential impact of adverse effects. There is a rationale for lipid-lowering treatment in the more highly functional older patient with cardiovascular (especially stroke) risk higher than side effect risks in the near term and with an estimated lifespan longer than the time to benefit. Aspirin has higher side effect risks and requires a longer time to achieve benefit. Trial data are lacking on exercise interventions, but multi-system benefits have been shown in older patients such that exercise should be part of a preventive regimen. Preventive therapy in the very old means considering not only medical issues of co-morbidities, polypharmacy, and altered risk-benefit relationship of medications but also adjusting goals and approaches across the older agespan in keeping with informed patient preferences.",

Potential candidates for cholesterol-lowering treatments included patients with diabetes or hypertension aged 40 to 75 years who were not already receiving a cholesterol-lowering medication, as well as patients receiving cholesterol-lowering therapies during the baseline period.

    "125": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria (HMGA; OMIM 246450) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, caused by the deficiency of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (4.1.3.4), which results in the accumulation of\u00a03-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric (HMG) and 3-methylglutaric (MGA) acids in tissues and biological fluids of affected individuals. Recent in vivo and in vitro animal studies have demonstrated that the accumulation of these metabolites can disturb the cellular redox homeostasis, which can contribute to the neurological manifestations presented by the patients. So, in the present work, we investigated oxidative stress parameters in plasma and urine samples from HMGA patients, obtained at the moment of diagnosis of this disorder and during therapy with low-protein diet and L-carnitine supplementation. It was verified that untreated HMGA patients presented higher levels of urinary di-tyrosine and plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBA-RS), which are markers of protein and lipid oxidative damage, respectively, as well as a reduction of the urinary antioxidant capacity. Treated HMGA patients also presented an increased protein oxidative damage, as demonstrated by their higher concentrations of plasma protein carbonyl groups and urinary di-tyrosine, as well as by the reduction of total sulfhydryl groups in plasma, in relation to controls. On the other hand, HMGA patients under therapy presented normal levels of TBA-RS and urinary antioxidant capacity, which can be related, at least in part, to the antioxidant and antiperoxidative effects exerted by L-carnitine. The results of this work are the first report showing that a redox imbalance occurs in patients with HMGA what reinforces the importance of the antioxidant therapy in this disorder.",

Contrary to this expectation, a paradoxical decrease in HDL-C levels after statin therapy is seen in some patients. We evaluated 724 patients who newly started treatment with statins after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). These patients were divided into 2 groups according to change in HDL-C levels between baseline and 6 to 9 months after initial AMI (\u0394HDL). In total, 620 patients had increased HDL-C levels and 104 patients had decreased HDL-C levels. Both groups achieved follow-up low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels <100 mg/dl. Adverse cardiovascular events (a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) have more frequently occurred in the decreased HDL group compared with the increased HDL group (15.4% vs 7.1%, p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that decreased HDL, onset to balloon time, and multivessel disease were the independent predictors of adverse cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR] 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08 to 3.52; HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09; and HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.56, respectively).

Whether this only applies to patients at already high risk for the development of T2DM or for all patients is still a matter of debate. In the present prospective cohort study of 4,645 patients with established vascular disease without DM at baseline, 3,057 patients used statins at baseline, of whom 1,608 used intensive statin therapy, defined as statin therapy theoretically lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with \u226540%. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the risk of incident T2DM with (intensive) statin therapy. Statin therapy was associated with increased risk of incident T2DM (hazard ratio 1.63; 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.32) when adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and plasma triglyceride levels. Intensive statin therapy tended to be related to a higher risk of T2DM compared with moderate statin therapy (hazard ratio 1.22; 95% confidence interval 0.92 to 1.61, adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and plasma triglyceride levels). The increase in risk was regardless of the number of metabolic syndrome characteristics or insulin resistance but was particularly present in patients with low baseline glucose levels (<5.6 mmol/L; p for interaction 2.9 \u00d7 10(-7)). In conclusion, statin use increases the risk of incident T2DM in patients with clinically manifest vascular disease. The increase in risk was independent of the number of metabolic syndrome criteria and was even more pronounced in patients with low baseline glucose levels.",

Stroke is a type of nervous focal disorder that occurs suddenly because of acute vascular events. 113-149 out of 100000 persons (0.113-0.149%) face with stroke in Iran annually. This causes treatment costs and many disabilities. Recently, studies indicated that statins, as a class of drugs, could decrease the chance of stroke recurrence and probably disabilities after stroke onset. This paper presents the effects of previous statins consumption on NIHSS in patients hospitalized in Shahid Mohammadi Hospital of Bandar Abbas in 2014-5. Materials and methods. Based on the World Health Organization categorization, 140 patients suffered from stroke, experienced stroke once or more, and were older than 20 years old. They were studied with a simple convenience sampling in this descriptive study during 2014-5. The exclusion criteria were non-neurological vision disorders, ICH, and unwillingness of the patients to participate in the research. The patients were classified into two teams, one taking statin before the stroke onset (group A) and other taking no statins before stroke onset (group B). Patients were initially examined with the help of NIHSS rate measurement (using NIHSS rating standard questionnaire), type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), and other demographic data. Then the data were inserted into SPSS 22 and descriptive statistical tests (median, mean and standard deviation), Spearman and Mann-Whitney tests, were used due to the abnormal distribution of the data. Results. 140 patients suffered from stroke (95 men (67.85%) and 45 women (32.14%)) with an average age of 67.9 years old, being studied in two groups (A and B). A direct correlation was seen between age and NIHSS (sig = 0.057) but it was not notable (P > 0.05). There was no clear relationship among sex, number of prior stroke onsets, type of stroke, lipid profile (TG, Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL), blood sugar, underlying disease (diabetes, hypertension and ischemic heart diseases), drug abuse and history of hospitalization in ICI with NIHSS rate (P > 0.05). 106 patients (75.71%) have never taken any type of statin class of drugs and only 34 patients (24.28%) were taking these medications before the stroke. The difference between NIHSS rates of groups A and B was not clear and notable (P > 0.05). Conclusion. According to the findings of this research, taking statins before the onset of stroke and immediately after it showed no significant difference in the level of following dysfunction, measured with NIHSS, and further studies are necessary.",

    "145": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), a common feature of brain aging, is characterized by lacunar infarcts, microbleeds, leukoaraiosis, and a leaky blood-brain barrier. Functionally, it is associated with cognitive decline, dementia, depression, gait abnormalities, and increased risk for stroke. Cerebral arterioles in this syndrome tend to hypertrophy and lose their capacity for adaptive vasodilation. Rodent studies strongly suggest that activation of Nox2-dependent NADPH oxidase activity is a crucial driver of these structural and functional derangements of cerebral arterioles, in part owing to impairment of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. This oxidative stress may also contribute to the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier seen in SVD. Hypertension, aging, metabolic syndrome, smoking, hyperglycemia, and elevated homocysteine may promote activation of NADPH oxidase in cerebral arterioles. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase with phycocyanobilin from spirulina, as well as high-dose statin therapy, may have potential for prevention and control of SVD, and high-potassium diets merit study in this regard. Measures which support effective eNOS activity in other ways-exercise training, supplemental citrulline, certain dietary flavonoids (as in cocoa and green tea), and capsaicin, may also improve the function of cerebral arterioles. Asian epidemiology suggests that increased protein intakes may decrease risk for SVD; conceivably, arginine and/or cysteine-which boosts tissue glutathione synthesis, and can be administered as N-acetylcysteine-mediate this benefit. Ameliorating the risk factors for SVD-including hypertension, metabolic syndrome, hyperglycemia, smoking, and elevated homocysteine-also may help to prevent and control this syndrome, although few clinical trials have addressed this issue to date.",

The management of elevated serum phosphorus has been a challenge in this patient population with compromised kidney performance, as available phosphorus lowering agents possess many undesirable hazardous secondary effects and/or are very expensive. While niacin in different formulation is known to not only correct dyslipidemia but also reduce phosphorus level, but its clinical use restricted owing to side effects. The objective of present study is to evaluate such effect of niacin extended release (NER) in ischemic nephropathy. The chronic kidney disease patients fulfilling the pre-defined criteria were randomly categorized into two groups of equal size (n=60) and prescribed either atorvastatin 20 mg/day or NER 500 mg/day with the same dose of statin for four months. A control of 50 healthy characters matched was also incorporated for local reference range. Baseline and follow up phosphorus concentration was measured and means were compared using t-test at SPSS version 17 with 0.05 chosen alpha. There was no difference in the baseline levels in both groups while significant (p<0.001) hyperphosphatemia was observed in both units as compared with healthy controls. The administration of atorvastatin alone for four weeks showed an insignificant decrease in phosphorus, whereas, NER significantly reduced phosphorus (p<0.001). The mean percent change from baseline to follow up further endorsed the finding as statin alone brought -13.8 % reduction in phosphorus and NER -47 % from baseline. NER, at its lowest prescribed dose once a day was well tolerated by most of the patients and demonstrated significant goal achievement of phosphorus reduction.

The need of the administration of iron preparations is indicated in the case of anemia associated with iron deficiency or due to major bleeding. It was found that in patients with ACS even mild thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding complications and in-hospital mortality, the risk of reinfarction, cardiogenic shock and stroke. Worse prognosis in patients with ACS is also associated with a decreased platelet count on admission to hospital and with increased mean platelet volume. In patients with ACS, we deal with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenia caused by the use of antiplatelet agents. The treatment of these causes of thrombocytopenia is an important issue. Increased platelet reactivity is observed in patients with increased MPV. This results in the development of restenosis, worse blood flow after PCI, in the increase in mortality and a higher incidence of the phenomenon of \"no-reflow\". The use of abciximab in STEMI and NSTEMI was associated with a decrease in MPV. Statins also caused a significant decrease in MPV.",

This work assessed possible changes in the structural and biomechanical properties of the tendons after chronic treatment with statins. Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: treated with atorvastatin (A-20 and A-80), simvastatin (S-20 and S-80) and the group that received no treatment (C). The doses of statins were calculated using allometric scaling, based on the doses of 80\u2009mg/day and 20\u2009mg/day recommended for humans. The morphological aspect of the tendons in A-20, S-20 and S-80 presented signals consistent with degeneration. Both the groups A-80 and S-80 showed a less pronounced metachromasia in the compression region of the tendons. Measurements of birefringence showed that A-20, A-80 and S-80 groups had a lower degree of organization of the collagen fibers. In all of the groups treated with statins, the thickness of the epitenon was thinner when compared to the C group. In the biomechanical tests the tendons of the groups A-20, A-80 and S-20 were less resistant to rupture. Therefore, statins affected the organization of the collagen fibers and decreased the biomechanical strength of the tendons, making them more predisposed to ruptures.", 
    "175": "Simvastatin (SIM), a widely used anti-lipidemic drug, has been identified as a bone anabolic agent. Its poor water solubility and the lack of distribution to the skeleton, however, have limited its application in the treatment of bone metabolic diseases. In this study, an amphiphilic macromolecular prodrug of SIM was designed and synthesized to overcome these limitations. The polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based prodrug can spontaneously self-assemble to form micelles. The use of SIM trimer as the prodrug's hydrophobic segment allows easy encapsulation of additional free SIM. The in vitro studies showed that SIM/SIM-mPEG micelles were internalized by MC3T3 cells via lysosomal trafficking and consistently induced expression of both BMP2 and DKK1 mRNA, suggesting that the prodrug micelle retains the biological functions of SIM. After systemic administration, optical imaging suggests that the micelles would passively target to bone fracture sites associated with hematoma and inflammation. Furthermore, flow cytometry study revealed that SIM/SIM-mPEG micelles had preferred cellular uptake by inflammatory and resident cells within the fracture callus tissue. The treatment study using a mouse osteotomy model validated the micelles' therapeutic efficacy in promoting bone fracture healing as demonstrated by micro-CT and histological analyses. Collectively, these data suggest that the macromolecular prodrug-based micelle formulation of SIM may have great potential for clinical management of impaired fracture healing.",

Cognitive function was measured with the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT; worst score, 0; best score, 175 points) and the Visual Association Test (VAT; low performance, 0-10; high performance, 11-12 points) in an observational study that included 4,095 community-dwelling participants aged 35-82 years. Data on statin use were obtained from a computerized pharmacy database. Analysis were done for the total cohort and subsamples matched on cardiovascular risk (N\u200a=\u200a1232) or propensity score for statin use (N\u200a=\u200a3609). We found that a total of 904 participants (10%) used a statin. Statin users were older than non-users: mean age (SD) 61 (10) vs. 52 (11) years (p<0.001). The median duration of statin use was 3.8 (interquartile range, 1.6-4.5) years. Unadjusted, statin users had worse cognitive performance than non-users. The mean RFFT score (SD) in statin users and non-users was 58 (23) and 72 (26) points, respectively (p<0.001). VAT performance was high in 261 (29%) statin users and 1351 (43%) non-users (p<0.001).

Statin users with high doses or long-term use had similar cognitive performance as non-users. This was found in persons with low as well as high cardiovascular risk, and in younger as well as older subjects. Also, the mean RFFT score per quintile of propensity score for statin use was comparable for statin users and non-users. Similar results were found for the VAT score as outcome measure. In conclusion, statin use was not associated with cognitive function. This was independent of statin dose or duration of statin use.",

Pure PCL, pure PLXs (T908 and T1107 varieties) and three distinct PCL:PLX 75:25, 50:50, 25:75% w/w blends, with and without the osteogenic and angiogenic bioactive molecule simvastatin were processed at constant pressure of 20 MPa and temperature of 40 \u00b0C or 43 \u00b0C, for T1107 and T908, respectively. Obtained porous blends were characterized applying a wide range of techniques and in vitro methods. Calorimetric analysis showed that hydrophilic T908 and T1107 PLXs are miscible with PCL for all tested compositions. Prepared PCL:PLX porous blends rapidly lost mass when immersed into phosphate buffer pH 7.4 due to PLXs dissolution and then went through slow and almost constant erosion rates for the subsequent weeks due to PCL slow hydrolytic degradation, which explains the rapid initial release of simvastatin and its subsequent sustained release for longer periods of time. PCL and PCL:PLX 75:25% w/w porous blends, containing or not simvastatin, showed a high cytocompatibility with SAOS-2 cells.

However, activity of rituximab may be reduced by conformational change in CD20 by statin-induced cholesterol depletion. Conformation change in CD20 could impair the binding of rituximab and significantly decrease the killing effect of lymphoma cells. R-CHOP therapy could counteract the prognostic gap between GC type and non-GC type. We investigated whether statin use could have different clinical impacts on immunohistochemical DLBCL subtypes in the rituximab era. We analyzed data from 409 patients with de novo DLBCL who received R-CHOP therapy. During median follow-up time of 38.6 months, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the GC type were similar to those in the non-GC type (PFS, p=0.125; OS, p=0.201). Moreover, survivals were comparable between patients with statin therapy and those without the statin therapy (PFS, p=0.282; OS, p=0.273). We also analyzed whether statin therapy would have clinical significance by immunophenotypes in patients treated with R-CHOP therapy. The non-GC type with statin therapy had inferior PFS and OS compared to other groups (PFS, p=0.008; OS, p=0.006). In multivariate analysis, statin therapy had significant negative impacts on survivals of the non-GC type independent of other clinical factors (PFS, hazard ratio/HR: 1.553, 95% CI: 1.058-2.279, p=0.024; OS, HR=1.532, 95% CI: 1.041-2.255, p=0.023).

    "213": "Amelioration of both oxidative and inflammation status after cholesterol lowering treatment in CKD might be mediated by restoration of antioxidant taurine concentrations during therapy (from 51.1 \u00b1 13.3 \u03bcmol/L at baseline to 63.1 \u00b1 16.4 \u03bcmol/L, p < 0.001 by ANOVA), suggesting that improvement of both oxidative and inflammation status in CKD patients could be explained, at least partly, by the cholesterol lowering effects.", 
    "214": "The cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor clarithromycin may also inhibit liver-specific organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3). We studied whether concurrent use of clarithromycin and a statin not metabolized by CYP3A4 was associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse events.", 
    "215": "Using large health care databases, we studied a population-based cohort of older adults (mean age 74 years) who were taking a statin not metabolized by CYP3A4 (rosuvastatin [76% of prescriptions], pravastatin [21%] or fluvastatin [3%]) between 2002 and 2013 and were newly prescribed clarithromycin (n=51,523) or azithromycin (n=52,518), the latter an antibiotic that inhibits neither CYP3A4 nor OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Outcomes were hospital admission with a diagnostic code for rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia, and all-cause mortality. All outcomes were assessed within 30 days after co-prescription.", 
    "216": "Compared with the control group, patients co-prescribed clarithromycin and a statin not metabolized by CYP3A4 were at increased risk of hospital admission with acute kidney injury (adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31 to 2.09), admission with hyperkalemia (adjusted RR 2.17, 95% CI 1.22 to 3.86) and all-cause mortality (adjusted RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.76). The adjusted RR for admission with rhabdomyolysis was 2.27 (95% CI 0.86 to 5.96). The absolute increase in risk for each outcome was small and likely below 1%, even after we considered the insensitivity of some hospital database codes.", 
    "217": "Among older adults taking a statin not metabolized by CYP3A4, co-prescription of clarithromycin versus azithromycin was associated with a modest but statistically significant increase in the 30-day absolute risk of adverse outcomes.", 
    "218": "Statins are competitive inhibitors of HMGCoA reductase and are commonly used as antihypercholesterolemic agents. Experimental studies clearly demonstrate the beneficial effects of statins on bone. Tocotrienols have also been shown to have anti-osteoporotic effects on the skeletal system. This study was conducted to observe the effect of a combination of delta-tocotrienol and lovastatin on structural bone histomorphometry and bone biomechanical strength in a postmenopausal rat model at clinically tolerable doses, and to compare it with the effect of delta-tocotrienol or lovastatin.", 
    "219": "Forty-eight female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: baseline control; sham-operated control; ovariectomised control; ovariectomised+11mg/kg lovastatin; ovariectomised+60mg/kg delta-tocotrienol and ovariectomised+60mg/kg delta-tocotrienol+11mg/kg lovastatin. These treatments were given via oral gavage daily for eight weeks. After sacrificing the rats, the left and right femurs were dissected and processed for bone histomorphometric analysis and a bone biomechanical test, respectively.", 
    "220": "Delta-tocotrienol in combination with lovastatin significantly improved the trabecular volume, trabecular number, trabecular thickness and trabecular separation; and it significantly increased bone strength in oestrogen-deficient rats. Delta-tocotrienol alone enhanced bone formation and maintained bone strength in ovariectomised rats. Delta-tocotrienol plus lovastatin treatment promoted better trabecular volume and trabecular number and received higher load than delta-tocotrienol alone. Lovastatin alone was not effective.", 
    "221": "Thus, the combination of delta-tocotrienol and lovastatin has the potential to be used for anti-osteoporotic therapy in postmenopausal women.", 
    "222": "The cholesterol reducing drugs, statins, exhibit anti-tumor effects against cancer stem cells and various cancer cell lines, exert potent additivity or synergy with existing chemotherapeutics in animal models of cancer and may reduce cancer incidence and cancer related mortality in humans. However, not all tumor cell lines are sensitive to statins, and clinical trials have demonstrated mixed outcomes regarding statins as anticancer agents. Here, we show that statin-induced reduction in intracellular cholesterol levels correlate with the growth inhibition of cancer cell lines upon statin treatment. Moreover, statin sensitivity segregates with abundant cytosolic vimentin expression and absent cell surface E-cadherin expression, a pattern characteristic of mesenchymal-like cells. Exogenous expression of cell surface E-cadherin converts statin- sensitive cells to a partially resistant state implying that statin resistance is in part dependent on the tumor cells attaining an epithelial phenotype. As metastasizing tumor cells undergo epithelial to mesenchymal transition during the initiation of the metastatic cascade, statin therapy may represent an effective approach to targeting the cells most likely to disseminate.", 
    "223": "Systemic inflammation and oxidative stress are crucial in mediating blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity loss during sepsis. Simvastatin possess potent anti-inflammation and antioxidation capacity. We sought to elucidate whether an acute bolus of simvastatin could mitigate BBB integrity loss in a rodent model of polymicrobial sepsis.", 
    "224": "A total of 96 adult male rats (200-250\u00a0g) were randomized to receive cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), CLP plus simvastatin, sham operation, or sham operation plus simvastatin (n\u00a0=\u00a024 in each group). After maintaining for 24\u00a0h, BBB integrity in the surviving rats was determined.", 
    "225": "CLP significantly induced BBB integrity loss, as grading of Evans blue staining of the brains, BBB permeability to Evans blue dye, and brain edema levels in rats receiving CLP were significantly higher than those receiving sham operation. In contrast, grading of Evans blue staining (P\u00a0=\u00a00.020), BBB permeability to Evans blue dye (P\u00a0=\u00a00.031), and brain edema levels (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) in rats receiving CLP plus simvastatin were significantly lower than those receiving CLP alone. Tight junction proteins claudin-3 and claudin-5 in endothelial cells are major structural components of BBB. Our data revealed that concentrations of claudin-3 and claudin-5 in rats receiving CLP were significantly lower than those receiving CLP plus simvastatin (P\u00a0=\u00a00.010 and 0.007). Immunohistochemistry further revealed significant fragmentation of claudin-3 and claudin-5 in rats receiving CLP. Moreover, levels of claudin-3 and claudin-5 fragmentation in rats receiving CLP plus simvastatin were significantly lower than those receiving CLP.", 
    "226": "Simvastatin mitigates BBB integrity loss in a rodent model of polymicrobial sepsis.", 
    "227": "Simvastatin (SIM), which is widely used in hyperlipidemia treatment, has also attracted attention due to its anabolic effects on bones. This study is designed to investigate the effectiveness of 2\u00a0mg SIM combined with 3 different carriers as delivery systems. Bone defects were surgically created in the femoral bones of 14 New Zealand white rabbits. The carriers used were the inorganic bovine bone graft (BOS), the hydroxyapatite combined with calcium sulfate (HACS), and the collagen sponge (COS). The bone defects were divided for each time period into 7 groups, as follows: passive control group (CONT), active control groups (BOS), (HACS) and (COS) (no simvastatin), and groups (BOS\u00a0+\u00a0SIM), (HACS\u00a0+\u00a0SIM) (carrier and simvastatin combination). Animal were sacrificed at 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively, and bone defects areas were prepared for histological examination and histomorphometric evaluation. Analysis of variance demonstrated statistically significant differences between groups depending on the carrier used. At 4 weeks, the BOS\u00a0+\u00a0SIM group presented higher rates of new bone formation, whereas at 8 weeks more new bone formation was noted for the HACS\u00a0+\u00a0SIM group. This study suggests that local application of simvastatin, combined with an appropriate carrier, can promote new bone formation.", 
    "228": "People with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a 2 to 4 times higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases when compared to general population of similar age and sex. This risk remains after adjustment of other traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The dyslipidemia associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus is present in up to 60% of people with diabetes and contributes greatly to increased cardiovascular, morbidity and mortality risk in these patients. Diabetic dyslipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by an excess of triglycerides, a decrease in HDL-cholesterol and altered lipoprotein composition, consisting mainly in an excess of small, dense LDL particles. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of drug treatment of dyslipidemia (mainly statins) to prevent cardiovascular events and mortality in people with diabetes, both in primary and secondary prevention. This consensus document, developed by general practitioners, members of the Diabetes Group of the Spanish Society of Primary Care Physicians (SEMERGEN), aims to assist in the management of patients with diabetes and dyslipidemia in accordance with the most recent recommendations.", 
    "229": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis in temporomandibular joints (TMJs) is often treated with intra-articular steroid injections, which can inhibit condylar growth. The purpose of this study was to compare simvastatin (a cholesterol-lowering drug that reduces TMJ inflammation) with the steroid triamcinolone hexacetonide in experimental TMJ arthritis.", 
    "230": "Joint inflammation was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the TMJs of 40 growing Sprague Dawley rats; 4 other rats were left untreated. In the same intra-articular injection, one of the following was applied: (1) 0.5 mg of simvastatin in ethanol carrier, (2) ethanol carrier alone, (3) 0.15 mg of triamcinolone hexacetonide, (4) 0.5 mg of simvastatin and 0.15 mg of triamcinolone hexacetonide, or (5) nothing additional to the CFA. The animals were killed 28 days later, and their mandibles were evaluated morphometrically and with microcomputed tomography.", 
    "231": "The analysis showed that the TMJs subjected to CFA alone had decreased ramus height compared with those with no treatment (P <0.05). Groups that had injections containing the steroid overall had decreases in weight, ramus height, and bone surface density when compared with the CFA-alone group (P <0.0001). Groups that had injections containing simvastatin, however, had overall increases in weight (P <0.0001), ramus height (P <0.0001), condylar width (P <0.05), condylar bone surface density (P <0.05), and bone volume (P <0.0001) compared with the groups receiving the steroid injections, and they were not different from the healthy (no treatment) group.", 
    "232": "Treatment of experimentally induced arthritis in TMJs with intra-articular simvastatin preserved normal condylar bone growth.", 
    "233": "Acute graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) is a life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Most of the knowledge about the biology of GvHD is derived from mouse models of this disease and therefore a critical analysis of potential advantages and disadvantages of the murine GvHD models is important to classify and understand the findings made in these models. The central events leading up to GvHD were characterized in three phases which includes the tissue damage-phase, the T cell priming-phase and the effector-phase, when the disease becomes clinically overt. The role of individual cytokines, chemokines, transcription factor or receptors was studied in these models by using gene deficient or transgenic mice in the donor or recipient compartments. Besides, numerous studies have been performed in these models to prevent or treat GvHD. Several recent clinical trials were all based on previously reported findings from the mouse model of GvHD such as the trials on CCR5-blockade, donor statin treatment, vorinostat treatment or adoptive transfer of regulatory T cells for GvHD prevention. The different mouse models for GvHD and graft-vs-leukemia effects are critically reviewed and their impact on current clinical practice is discussed."
