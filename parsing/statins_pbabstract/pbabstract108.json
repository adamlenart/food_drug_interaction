Forty-eight male SD rats underwent 90 min of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), followed by reperfusion. Rats were orally given (1) rosuvastatin 1mg/kg, (2) rosuvastatin 10mg/kg or (3) water (vehicle) once a day from 7 days before to 1 day after induction of tMCAO. Neurological score, infarct volume, and oxidative stress-related molecules (assessed by immunohistochemistry, dihydroethidium staining, or western blotting) were estimated at 24h after reperfusion. Rosuvastatin prevented the impairment of neurological function and decreased the infarct volume, compared with the vehicle group. The increases in activated microglia, macrophage, and superoxide levels usually caused by ischemia/reperfusion were significantly ameliorated by rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin also inhibited the upregulation of gp91(phox) and p22phox, phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B, and induction of cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, compared with vehicle. The results suggest that pretreatment with rosuvastatin may be a promising therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury, through attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation.",

Herein, we investigate the effect of CP-778875 on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin acid and its metabolites in humans. 2. The study incorporated a fixed-sequence design conducted in two groups. Group A was designed to estimate the effects of multiple doses of CP-778875 on the single dose pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin. Subjects in group A (n = 26) received atorvastatin (40 mg) on days 1 and 9 and CP-778875 (1.0 mg QD) on days 5-12. Group B was designed to examine the effects of multiple doses of atorvastatin on the single dose pharmacokinetics of CP-778875. Subjects in group B (n = 29) received CP-778875 (0.3 mg) on days 1 and 9 and atorvastatin (40 mg QD) on days 5-12. 3. Mean maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve of atorvastatin were increased by 45% and 20%, respectively, upon co-administration with CP-778875. Statistically significant increases in the systemic exposure of ortho- and para-hydroxyatorvastatin were also observed upon concomitant dosing with CP-778875. CP-778875 pharmacokinetics, however, were not impacted upon concomitant dosing with atorvastatin. 4.\u2002 Inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 by CP-778875 (IC50 = 2.14 \u00b1 0.40 \u03bcM) could be the dominant cause of the pharmacokinetic interaction as CP-778875 did not exhibit significant inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4/3A5, multidrug resistant protein 1 or breast cancer resistant protein, which are also involved in the hepatobiliary disposition of atorvastatin.",

Therefore, the present study was aimed at preparing nanoemulsion (NE) of simvastatin for improving its solubility and/or dissolution rate for enhancing its bioavailability. The NEs were evaluated for particle size (PS), zeta potential, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), viscosity, in vitro release and stability studies. The optimised NE showed PS of 132\u2009\u2009\u00b1\u2009\u20099\u2009nm and zeta potential of 17.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.2\u2009mV. TEM studies demonstrated spherical shape and size of the globules. In vitro release studies showed increased dissolution rate of NE compared with plain drug (PD). Pharmacokinetic studies showed relative bioavailability of simvastatin NE was 369.0% with respect to PD suspension. Pharmacodynamic studies conducted in hyperlipidemic rats showed that significant decrease in the total cholesterol and triglyceride levels for NE as compared with PD proving improvement in bioavailability. In conclusion, NE has great potential for improving bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs like simvastatin.",

There is as yet no consensus regarding the intensity and duration of treatment and type of statins.", 
    "32": "Despite appropriate anti-malarial treatment, cerebral malaria (CM)-associated mortalities remain as high as 30%. Thus, adjunctive therapies are urgently needed to prevent or reduce such mortalities. Overproduction of CXCL10 in a subset of CM patients has been shown to be tightly associated with fatal human CM. Mice with deleted CXCL10 gene are partially protected against experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) mortality indicating the importance of CXCL10 in the pathogenesis of CM. However, the direct effect of increased CXCL10 production on brain cells is unknown. We assessed apoptotic effects of CXCL10 on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBVECs) and neuroglia cells in vitro. We tested the hypothesis that reducing overexpression of CXCL10 with a synthetic drug during CM pathogenesis will increase survival and reduce mortality. We utilized atorvastatin, a widely used synthetic blood cholesterol-lowering drug that specifically targets and reduces plasma CXCL10 levels in humans, to determine the effects of atorvastatin and artemether combination therapy on murine ECM outcome. We assessed effects of atorvastatin treatment on immune determinants of severity, survival, and parasitemia in ECM mice receiving a combination therapy from onset of ECM (day 6 through 9 post-infection) and compared results with controls. The results indicate that CXCL10 induces apoptosis in HBVECs and neuroglia cells in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that increased levels of CXCL10 in CM patients may play a role in vasculopathy, neuropathogenesis, and brain injury during CM pathogenesis. Treatment of ECM in mice with atorvastatin significantly reduced systemic and brain inflammation by reducing the levels of the anti-angiogenic and apoptotic factor (CXCL10) and increasing angiogenic factor (VEGF) production. Treatment with a combination of atorvastatin and artemether improved survival (100%) when compared with artemether monotherapy (70%), p<0.05. Thus, adjunctively reducing CXCL10 levels and inflammation by atorvastatin treatment during anti-malarial therapy may represent a novel approach to treating CM patients.", 
    "33": "Among the various hypolipidemic drugs, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (also known as \"statins\") belong to a heterogeneous class of compounds, sharing an identical hypocholesterolemic effect that develops through direct inhibition of a rate-limiting step in endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Their mechanism of action entails competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Several lines of evidence suggest that the pleiotropic effects of statins may also play a role in prevention of venous thrombosis, wherein hypercholesterolemic patients are characterized by enhanced thrombin generation, increased susceptibility to endothelial dysfunction and platelet hyperreactivity, so that limiting or counteracting the burden of one or more of these mechanisms would provide an effective means of prophylaxis. Plausible biological links can also be found between statin therapy and reduction of thrombotic risk, mainly targeting immune system, blood coagulation, endothelium, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. The earlier JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention) trial provided appealing evidence that the risk of venous thrombosis may be lowered by statins. The results of the following studies and those of recent meta-analyses have, however, questioned this assumption. Currently, it seems thereby cautious to conclude that the use of statins as part of the approach used for preventing venous thromboembolism appears unwarranted. This is due to the existence of controversial clinical evidence, to the large number of patients who would need to be treated to prevent one case of venous thrombosis, as well as to the tangible risk of side effects. More randomized and the larger studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.",

    "38": "After successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, adequate myocardial reperfusion is not achieved in up to 50% of patients. This phenomenon of no-reflow is associated with a poor in-hospital and long-term prognosis. Four main factors are thought to contribute to the occurrence of no-reflow: ischaemic injury; reperfusion injury; distal embolization; susceptibility of the microcirculation to injury. This review evaluates the literature, and in particular the clinical trials, concerned with pharmacological and physical methods for prevention and treatment of no-reflow. A number of drugs may improve no-reflow experimentally and clinically, but some have not yet been associated with conclusive improvements in clinical outcome. The complex interacting factors in no-reflow make it unlikely that any single agent will be effective for all patients. Confirmed methods known to be beneficial in the prevention of no-reflow (such as aspirin therapy, chronic statin therapy, blood glucose control, thrombus aspiration in patients with a high thrombus burden and ischaemic preconditioning) should be offered to patients as often as possible, to prevent and treat no-reflow.",

Also preoperative statin therapy resulted in a significantly lower postoperative mortality (0.72 [0.61-0.84]) irrespective of the type of surgery. There was no effect of preoperative statin therapy on the incidence of AKI in any of the sub-group of the patients.",

    "43": "It is now widely recognized that in order to optimize bone health in the later years, bone healthy behaviors should begin at a young age and continue throughout life. Prescribed orally to lower lipid levels in adults of all ages, statins have also been shown to stimulate bone formation in vitro by promoting bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) activity and to stimulate bone formation in vivo. Weight bearing exercise is well known to stimulate bone formation through a mechanism whereby mechanical loading is 'sensed' by the mechano-sensors leading to a cascade of events involving the activation of osteoblasts. For individuals with high cholesterol levels, both of these interventions are recommended throughout adult life. Since statins and exercise stimulate bone formation via different mechanisms, we hypothesized that exercise in combination with oral simvastatin synergistically increases bone mineral density and strength. Mature adult female, Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: control (n=9), statin only (n=8), exercise only (n=11), and statin plus exercise (n=11). Simvastatin was given to the two groups at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day in standard rat chow for the entire 5 week period. All rats ate the same mass of food. The two exercise groups ran on a treadmill with progressively greater speeds and time, ending on week 5 at 30 m/min for 60 min. After 5 weeks, rats were euthanized, and excised femurs were scanned for areal bone mineral density (BMD) and tested by three point bending to obtain the following performance measures: maximum force (strength), stiffness, and work-to-fracture. Only the group treated with statins and exercise showed a positive effect on the biomechanical performance of the femurs. Compared to controls, this group had increased maximum force, stiffness, moment of inertia, and BMD. Linear regression analysis revealed that the increased performance was related to increased BMD. We conclude that the combination of oral statins and appropriate exercise increases bone strength better than either individual treatment and may provide optimal protection against osteoporosis.", 
    "44": "Screening is the systematic use of a test for a health problem or risk factor when no recognized signs or symptoms would indicate the presence of that problem or risk factor. Abnormal glucose metabolism can be documented years before the onset of overt diabetes. Nowadays, prediabetes can be subdivided into impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Substantial number of subjects with either will progress to overt diabetes within years. Prediabetes bears also the increased risk of cardiovascular complications. Prehypertension is much newer term introduced by the seventh report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) published in 2003 as systolic blood pressure from 120 to 139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure from 80 to 89 mmHg in adults (not receiving blood pressure-lowering treatment). Similarly prehypertension also increased the risk of cardiovascular complications and progression to hypertension. Chronic kidney disease is also highly prevalent mainly in the elderly. It is associated with important adverse outcomes such as cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Factors associated with higher risk of chronic kidney disease include mainly hypertension, diabetes, obesity and older age. Early detection and diagnosis of chronic kidney disease may prevent the full blown disease and its end-stage requiring renal replacement therapy. The review focus on the problem of high risk population for development of diabetes, hypertension and whether time has come to focus also on the conditions predisposing to the development of chronic kidney disease.",

The finding of a residual clinical risk, despite LDL cholesterol lowering, supports the need to develop additional therapeutic strategies for CV prevention. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that targeting the protective properties of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) may be beneficial. Disappointing results from recent reports of HDL genetics and raising agents and clinical events has fueled considerable debate as to whether attempts to target HDL will be of clinical benefit or futility. This review will reflect on challenges faced in developing new effective HDL targeted therapies.", 
    "46": "The purpose of this study was to develop spray dried self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) tablets of rosuvastatin using mannitol as a carrier. SNEDDS were prepared using Capryol 90, poloxamer 407 and Transcutol P or triacetin as oil, surfactant and cosurfactants, respectively. The prepared systems were characterized and their cytotoxicity was evaluated using Caco-2 cell lines. A comparative bioavailability study was performed in human volunteers relative to the conventional commercial product. Results showed better self-nanoemulsifying ability of systems containing triacetin compared to Transcutol P. SNEDDS formed uni-modal nanoemulsion droplet size distributions with droplet size less than 50 nm and polydispersity index values ranging from 0.127 to 0.275. The solubilizing capacity of rosuvastatin was affected by both surfactant and cosurfactant concentrations. Upon spray drying, systems prepared using Transcutol P tended to be soft and tacky and were sticking to the walls of the dryer. The redispersion of rosuvastatin from solid SNEDDS was very fast (100% within 5 minutes). Optimized SNEDDS prepared with triacetin were safe with no cytotoxic effect on Caco-2 cells. The anticancer effect of rosuvastatin was enhanced when incorporated in SNEDDS (IC50 value decreased from 4 to 3 microg/ml) due to the increase in penetration of SNEDDS inside the cells. The relative bioavailability for SNEDDS tablets compared to the commercial tablets was 167%. The effective solubilization, penetration and enhancement in bioavailability of SNEDDS tablets proves their potential as a safe, and effective drug delivery system for poorly-soluble drugs.",

Simvastatin, the antihyperlipidemic agent, exhibits additional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of the present work was to investigate the protective effect of simvastatin against cadmium-induced testicular toxicity in rats. The rats received a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of cadmium chloride (2\u00a0mg/kg). Simvastatin treatment (5\u00a0mg/kg/day, i.p.) was applied for three consecutive days, starting 1\u00a0day before cadmium administration. Cadmium significantly decreased serum testosterone, and testicular reduced glutathione and catalase activity, and significantly increased testicular malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and cadmium ion levels. Simvastatin significantly ameliorated the biochemical changes induced by cadmium. Cadmium-induced testicular tissue injury observed by histopathological examination was attenuated by simvastatin. In addition, simvastatin significantly decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, nuclear factor-\u03baB, and caspase-3, and increased heme oxygenase-1 expression in testicular tissue of rats exposed to cadmium toxicity. It was concluded that simvastatin, through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, provided a significant protective effect against cadmium-induced testicular toxicity in rats. However, starting treatment with simvastatin before cadmium exposure, as done in the present work, is not clinically applicable. Therefore, other investigations are needed to assess the protective effect of simvastatin treatment following induction of cadmium testicular toxicity.",

In this randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, twelve healthy Chinese males were administered with pitavastatin 4 mg/d or the placebo for 5 d followed by repaglinide 4 mg given orally on d 5. Plasma repaglinide and glucose levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and the glucose oxidase method, respectively. Treatment with pitavastatin significantly increased the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of repaglinide (P=0.003) in SLCO1B1*1b homozygotes (P=0.015) and SLCO1B1*15 carriers (P=0.031). Treatment with pitavastatin led to a marginal increase in the area under plasma concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC0\u21d2\u221e) of repaglinide (P=0.091). There was no significant difference in pharmacokinetic parameters or hypoglycemic effects of repaglinide among SLCO1B1 genotypes in either the pitavastatin or control group. Pitavastatin increased the Cmax of the plasma concentration of repaglinide in an SLCO1B1 genotype dependent manner, but had no apparent effect on the pharmacodynamics of repaglinide in healthy volunteers.

PGC-1\u03b1 RNA levels were determined using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Mitochondrial content was determined using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. Metabolism was determined by quantification of extracellular acidification rate and oxygen consumption rate. Treatment of human rhabdomyosarcoma cells with simvastatin significantly reduced oxidative, total metabolism, and cellular ATP content in a time- and dose-dependent manner which was rescued by concurrent treatment with ubiquinol. Treatment with simvastatin significantly reduced mitochondrial content as well as cell viability which were both rescued by simultaneous treatment with ubiquinol.

The aims of this study were to examine the regulatory role of interleukin-18 (IL-18) in the connexin 43 (Cx43) and the proliferation of cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as well as to elucidate the underlying therapeutic mechanism of simvastatin. Vytorin therapy significantly alleviated high-cholesterol diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, suppressed neointimal hyperplasia, macrophage infiltration, and Cx43 and IL-18 expression in rabbit aortic walls. In vitro study using an aortic SMC line showed that IL-18 up-regulated constitutive Cx43 expression and potentiated tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1)-triggered Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. Simvastatin treatment alone reduced constitutive Cx43 levels and prevented the TNF-\u03b1-induced IL-18 up-regulation. Mechanistic investigation using kinase-specific inhibitors showed that simvastatin pretreatment attenuated TNF-\u03b1-elicited Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas PI3K and all MAPK activities were also implied in the additive effect of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-18 on Cx43 up-regulation. Proliferation assay indicated that IL-18 stimulated SMC proliferation and synergized the TNF-\u03b1-stimulated cell proliferation. Likewise, simvastatin treatment suppressed the SMC over-proliferation induced not only by TNF-\u03b1 alone, but also by simultaneous treatment with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-18. The suppression of simvastatin in SMC proliferation was not mediated through mitochondrial related pro-apoptogenesis under both scenarios. In conclusion, simvastatin attenuates the additive effects of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-18 on Cx43 up-regulation and over-proliferation of aortic SMCs, mainly through the blockade of Akt signaling pathway. These findings may fortify the rationale underlying the atheroprotective mechanism of statin therapy.",

Supplementation with eicosapentaenoic (EPA) or docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids reduced LDL particle number and/or increased LDL size in different populations, but studies in FH are scarce. We investigated cross-sectionally whether intake of EPA and DHA in the usual diet is associated with a less atherogenic lipoprotein profile in subjects with FH (n=215). Lipoprotein particle number and size distributions were assessed with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. EPA and DHA proportions in serum phosphatidylcholine, a biomarker of fish intake, were determined by gas chromatography. After adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, including fasting triglycerides, serum phosphatidylcholine EPA (but not DHA) related inversely to medium VLDL, total LDL particle number and very small LDL, resulting in a net direct association with LDL size. Additionally, EPA was directly associated with concentrations of large HDL. We conclude that increased serum phosphatidylcholine EPA derived from seafood intake with the usual diet is associated with a less atherogenic lipoprotein profile in subjects with FH.

Neonatal rat atrial cardiomyocytes (NRAM) were cultured and subjected to cyclical stretch on elastic membranes. Stretching with 1 Hz and 15% elongation for 30 min. resulted in increased expression of immediate early genes and phosphorylation of Erk and p38. A 24-hr stretch period resulted in hypertrophy-related changes including increased cell diameter, reinduction of the foetal gene program and cell death. No evidence of apoptosis was observed. Expression of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide and growth differentiation factor-15 was increased, and calcineurin signalling was activated. Expression of several potassium channels was decreased, suggesting electrical remodelling. Atrial stretch-induced change in skeletal \u03b1-actin expression was inhibited by pravastatin, but not by eplerenone or losartan. Stretch of NRAM results in elevation of stress markers, changes related to hypertrophy and dedifferentiation, electrical remodelling and cell death.

In studies including hypertensive patients, the decrease in blood pressures with statins was slightly greater (SBP, -3.07\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg; 95% CI, -4.00 to -2.15 and DBP, 1.04; 95% CI, -1.47 to -0.61). Similarly, statins effectively reduced SBP in diabetic patients. In this large meta-analysis of prospective controlled studies, the authors found a small but statistically significant reduction of SBP in patients taking statins. The decrease in blood pressure may contribute to the pleiotropic effect of statins in reducing cardiovascular risk.",

Consideration may also be given to the use of primary pharmacologic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin or oral vitamin K antagonist in patients with membranous nephropathy once the albumin level drops below 2.0-2.5 g/dL. Short-term use of pharmacologic prophylaxis during the first 6 months following diagnosis warrants further investigation.", 
    "113": "Multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2) is localized to the apical membrane of hepatocytes and played an important role in the biliary excretion of a broad range of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds and drugs, such as pravastatin. However, the effects of statins on MRP2 in the liver and the precise mechanisms of their actions have been obscure. The goal of this study was to determine the regulatory molecular mechanism for statin-induced MRP2 expression in hepatocytes. In vitro and in vivo studies suggested that pitavastatin increased MRP2 expression. Pitavastatin promoted liver X receptor (LXR) \u03b1/\u03b2 translocation from the cytosol to nuclei, resulting in LXR activation. Deletion and mutational analysis suggested that the potential sterol regulatory element (SRE) played a major role in the observed modulation of MRP2 expression by pitavastatin. Furthermore pitavastatin increased the protein-DNA complex, and when SRE was mutated, stimulation of the protein-DNA complex by pitavastatin was decreased. It was demonstrated that pitavastatin upregulated MRP2 expression by an SREBP regulatory pathway in hepatocytes and that the actions of statins may lead to improve the biliary excretion of MRP2 substrates.", 
    "114": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HL) deficiency is a genetic disorder biochemically characterized by predominant accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric (HMG) and 3-methylglutaric (MGA) acids in tissues and biological fluids of affected individuals. Clinically, the patients present neurological symptoms and basal ganglia injury, whose pathomechanisms are partially understood. In the present study, we investigated the ex vivo effects of intrastriatal administration of HMG and MGA on important parameters of oxidative stress in striatum of developing rats. Our results demonstrate that HMG and MGA induce lipid and protein oxidative damage. HMG and MGA also increased 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein oxidation, whereas only HMG elicited nitric oxide production, indicating a role for reactive oxygen (HMG and MGA) and nitrogen (HMG) species in these effects. Regarding the enzymatic antioxidant defenses, both organic acids decreased reduced glutathione concentrations and the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase and increased glutathione peroxidase activity. HMG also provoked an increase of catalase activity and a diminution of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. We finally observed that antioxidants fully prevented or attenuated HMG-induced alterations of the oxidative stress parameters, further indicating the participation of reactive species in these effects. We also observed that MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, prevented some of these effects, indicating the involvement of the NMDA receptor in HMG effects. The present data provide solid evidence that oxidative stress is induced in vivo by HMG and MGA in rat striatum and it is presumed that this pathomechanism may explain, at least in part, the cerebral alterations observed in HL deficiency.",

Studies are available for other drugs, but not so strong enough to draw definite conclusions. For now, we need prospective intervention trials specifically designed to investigate the long-term effects of a temporal approach to medical therapy.

Considering the specific capabilities of S. khuzistanica to produce highly pure carvacrol, this plant is an important potential source of carvacrol that could address the abundant consumption and increasing demand for this monoterpene in current world markets. This research was performed to better understand the process of biosynthesis and accumulation of carvacrol in S. khuzistanica. Tests were performed on shoot cultures of S. khuzistanica in Linsmaier-Skoog (LS) medium treated with different concentrations of fosmidomycin (an inhibitor of the non-mevalonate pathway) and mevinolin (an inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway) for 21 days at the following concentrations: 0, 10, 25, 50, 75 and 100 \u03bcM. The present study demonstrated that the MEP pathway is the major pathway that provides IPP for the biosynthesis of carvacrol, and the expression and activity levels of the DXR enzyme have a critical effect on carvacrol biosynthesis. Surprisingly, Mevinolin at concentrations of 75 and 100 \u03bcM increased the carvacrol content and the DXR activity and gene expression in S. khuzistanica plantlets.",

The modulation of CCL2 secretion and macrophage chemotaxis by simvastatin were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and transwell migration assay, respectively. In a rat model of induced apical periodontitis, the relation between disease progression and osteoblastic expression of Cyr61, p-FoxO3a, and CCL2 and macrophage recruitment were studied by radiographic and immunohistochemistry analyses.",

Simvastatin significantly counteracted the actions of TNF-\u03b1. Forced expression of FoxO3a reduced TNF-\u03b1-stimulated Cyr61 synthesis. Simvastatin and FoxO3a diminished TNF-\u03b1-induced CCL2 secretion and macrophage recruitment, whereas Cyr61 partially restored the stimulating action. In rat periapical lesions, simvastatin significantly attenuated bone resorption, reduced osteoblastic expressions of Cyr61, p-FoxO3a, and CCL2, and suppressed macrophage recruitment.",

These methods often suffer from several practical limitations. We propose a framework for hypothesis testing and sample size determination using Bayesian average errors. We consider rejecting the null hypothesis, in favor of the alternative, when a test statistic exceeds a cutoff. We choose the cutoff to minimize a weighted sum of Bayesian average errors and choose the sample size to bound the total error for the hypothesis test.

Incorporation of 5% \u03b1CD transforms dilute T908 solutions (as low as 2% copolymer) into gels, enhances the osteoinductive activity of T908, and provides simvastatin sustained release for more than one week, which results in higher and more prolonged alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. The performance of the intrinsically osteoinductive polypseudorotaxane scaffold can be easily tuned by modifying the concentrations of T908, \u03b1CD, and simvastatin in a certain range of values. Moreover, the use of affordable, stable materials that can be sterilized applying a conventional method make the supramolecular gels advantageous candidates as scaffolds to be applied in the critical defect using minimally invasive techniques.",

We confirm that variation in diastolic function can be attributed, in part, to aortic compliance. Our novel approach of measuring compliance throughout the cardiac cycle, isolating radial and longitudinal contributions, and evaluating previously obtained images retrospectively provides advantages over previously reported measures of aortic compliance. Speckle tracking promises new insights into ventricular function, aortic mechanics, and the interaction between these structures.",

Patient characteristics included their age and gender as well as five medical profiles that were constructed from the diagnoses obtained during consultations. These were (1) disorders of lipoprotein metabolism, (2) heart disease, (3) diabetes, (4) complex profiles and (5) profiles based on other diagnoses. Physician characteristics included their age, gender, solo or group practice, weekly workload and payment scheme.",

For instance, patients older than 76 years with a complex profile were prescribed fewer patented statins than patients aged 68-76 years old with the same medical profile (coefficient: -0.225; p = 0.0008). By contrast, regardless of the patient's age, the medical profile did not affect the probability of prescribing a patented statin except in young patients with heart diseases who were prescribed a greater number of patented statins (coefficient: 0.3992; p = 0.0007). Prescribing was also statistically influenced by physician features, e.g., older male physicians were more likely to prescribe patented statins (coefficient: 0.245; p = 0.0417) and GPs practicing in groups were more likely to prescribe multiple sourced statins (coefficient: -0.178; p = 0.0338), which is an important finding of the study. GPs with a lower workload prescribed a greater number of patented statins.",

The efficacy and safety of lowering plasma LDL-C to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and secondary event rates are now well established. What has not been established, however, is a plasma LDL-C lower threshold level of safety and efficacy. Here we review intensive plasma LDL-C-lowering with statins and argue that even further reductions of plasma LDL-C than current guideline targets is likely to safely reduce cardiovascular event rates. We discuss how to achieve very low levels of plasma LDL-C using both traditional and novel LDL-lowering therapies.",

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2) is overexpressed in GO tissues. CCN2 promotes and sustains fibrosis initiated by TGF\u03b2. Previous studies have shown that JNK and Smad3 activation is required for TGF\u03b2-induced CCN2 expressions in human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). In this study, we have found that Src is a major signaling mediator for TGF\u03b2-induced CCN2 expressions in HGFs. Pre-treatment with 2 Src kinase inhibitors (PP2, Src inhibitor-1) significantly reduced TGF\u03b21-induced CCN2 synthesis and JNK and Smad3 activation in HGFs. These results suggest that Src is an upstream signaling transducer of JNK and Smad3 with respect to TGF\u03b21-stimulated CCN2 expression in HGFs. We further found that curcumin significantly abrogated the TGF\u03b21-induced CCN2 in HGFs by inhibiting the phosphorylations of Src, JNK, and Smad3. Furthermore, curcumin inhibited TGF\u03b21-induced HGF migration and \u03b1-SMA expression. Curcumin potentially qualifies as a useful agent for the control of GO.", 
    "137": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) exert pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system, in part through a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and reduction of vascular inflammation. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects, we investigated the effect of statins on TNF-\u03b1-induced ROS production, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Exposure of HAECs to TNF-\u03b1 caused production of ROS via Rac-1 membrane translocation and activation. The Rac-1 activation and ROS liberation mediated TNF-stimulated NF-\u03baB activation and the subsequent VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression. Extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) plays a central role in inhibiting endothelial inflammation. Immune complex kinase assay of protein extracts from HAECs treated with atorvastatin revealed increased ERK5 activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In addition, pretreatment with atorvastatin inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced ROS production and VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression. Chemical or genetic inhibition of ERK5 ablated the statins inhibition of Rac-1 activation, ROS formation, NF-\u03baB, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression induced by TNF-\u03b1. Taken together, statins, via ERK5 activation, suppress TNF-stimulated Rac-1 activation, ROS generation, NF-\u03baB activation and VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression in human ECs, which provides a novel explanation for the pleiotropic effects of statins that benefit the cardiovascular system.",

Although substantive progress has been made in reducing death and cardiovascular events, questions remain regarding the optimal approach to further reduce CVD-associated death and disability. Based on current evidence, statins are the clear first-line agents for the management of hyperlipidemia in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. However, due to the failure of recent clinical trials evaluating antihyperlipidemic drugs, the most appropriate lipid management strategy in patients who cannot tolerate statin therapy or who warrant antihyperlipidemic therapies in addition to statins is a major therapeutic controversy. In this review, we summarize the clinical trial evidence evaluating the efficacy of second-line antihyperlipidemic drug classes for reducing cardiovascular risk, provide recommendations for appropriate use of nonstatin lipid-altering drugs, and identify key areas of future research to support evidence-based lipid management. Given the complexity, magnitude, and burden of CVD, opportunities to improve processes of care and identify new therapeutic options clearly exist.",

This preventive attempt is particularly challenging in cancer types, which have a long subclinical developmental phase, because of their low cellular proliferation rate and their slow pre-clinical evolution, until they become clinically detectable and therapeutically as well as prognostically relevant. Therefore, only certain specific cancer types are presently in the focus of clinical chemoprevention. Among the GI tract cancer, colorectal (CRC) as well as esophageal cancer have raised the most attention over the past decades, as they both share a long precancerous stage (the adenoma in CRC and Barrett's esophagus in the case of esophageal adenocarcinoma) which provides a window of opportunity to intervene and prevent development of cancer.In this review, we will focus on both CRC as well as esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC).", 
    "144": "Thrombomodulin (TM) is a 557-amino acid protein with a broad cell and tissue distribution consistent with its wide-ranging physiological roles. When expressed on the lumenal surface of vascular endothelial cells in both large vessels and capillaries, its primary function is to mediate endothelial thromboresistance. The complete integral membrane-bound protein form displays five distinct functional domains, although shorter soluble (functional) variants comprising the extracellular domains have also been reported in fluids such as serum and urine. TM-mediated binding of thrombin is known to enhance the specificity of the latter serine protease toward both protein C and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), increasing their proteolytic activation rate by almost three orders of magnitude with concomitant anticoagulant, antifibrinolytic, and anti-inflammatory benefits to the vascular wall. Recent years have seen an abundance of research into the cellular mechanisms governing endothelial TM production, processing, and regulation (including flow-mediated mechanoregulation)--from transcriptional and posttranscriptional (miRNA) regulation of TM gene expression, to posttranslational processing and release of the expressed protein--facilitating greater exploitation of its therapeutic potential. The goal of the present paper is to comprehensively review the endothelial/TM system from these regulatory perspectives and draw some fresh conclusions. This paper will conclude with a timely examination of the current status of TM's growing therapeutic appeal, from novel strategies to improve the clinical efficacy of recombinant TM analogs for resolution of vascular disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), to an examination of the complex pleiotropic relationship between statin treatment and TM expression.",

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the efficacy of adding statins to IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C. Studies with data pertinent to the effect of statins on chronic hepatitis C were reviewed, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of the addition of statins to IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin were included in meta-analysis. The primary outcome measure was SVR. Secondary outcome measures were rapid virological response (RVR) and early virological response (EVR). The literature was systematically searched through October 2012. After screening of the 1724 non-duplicated entries, 54 potentially relevant studies were fully reviewed. Of those, 18 studies were relevant and 5 RCTs met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. In comparison with IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin therapy, the addition of statins significantly increased SVR (OR=2.02, 95% CI: 1.38-2.94), RVR (OR=3.51, 95% CI: 1.08-11.42) and EVR (OR=1.89, 95% CI: 1.20-2.98). The SVR increase remained significant for HCV genotype 1 (OR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.40-3.18). There were no significant increases in adverse events and withdrawals with the addition of statins. In conclusion, the addition of statins to IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin improves SVR, RVR, and EVR without additional adverse events and thus may be considered as adjuvant to IFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C.

AFM data also showed the ability for A\u03b2 to increase cell stiffness and adhesion probability in bEND3 cells. On the contrary, A\u03b2 lowered the overall force of membrane tether formation (Fmtf ), and produced a bimodal population of Fmtf , suggesting subcellular mechanical alterations in membrane tethering. The lower Fmtf population was similar to the results obtained from cells treated with an F-actin-disrupting drug, latrunculin A. Indeed, AFM results also showed that both A\u03b2 and latrunculin A decreased membrane stiffness, suggesting a lower membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion, a factor resulting in lower Fmtf . In addition, these cerebral endothelial alterations induced by A\u03b2 were abrogated by lovastatin, consistent with its anti-inflammatory effects. In sum, these results demonstrated the ability for A\u03b2 to enhance p-selectin expression at the CEC surface and induce cytoskeleton reorganization, which in turn, resulted in changes in membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion and membrane tethering, mechanical factors important in transmigration of monocytes through the BBB.",

Endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR), aortic lesion development, and quantification in thoracic aortas were measured during these two phase studies.", 
    "219": "Compared to the model group, the lipid and vWF plasma levels were significantly lower, the plasma nitrite levels were significantly higher, the fatty streaks of aortic lesions were significantly lower, and the endothelium dependent relaxation was significantly higher after both phase studies (P < 0.05). The DFMG supplementation led to significant plasma nitrite increment in all groups after both phase studies (P < 0.05). There were significantly decreased fatty streaks of aortic lesions in DFMG-prevented and DFMG-treated mice (P < 0.05). There was a significant increase in EDR in all prophylactic treatment groups and treatment groups (P < 0.05). We further demonstrated that the preventative effect was more obvious than the therapeutic effect.", 
    "220": "Our results suggest that DFMG could work in prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for atherosclerosis development.", 
    "221": "Several studies have reported a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or in patients with stable ischemic heart disease with the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Based on these findings, current guidelines recommend the use of statin therapy before hospital discharge for all patients with ACS regardless of the baseline low-density lipoprotein level. Statins are also recommended to patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Statins have been introduced in the clinical arena to reduce the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level that is associated with coronary atherosclerosis; however, a growing body of evidence suggests that other mechanisms of action beyond the modification of the lipid profile may come into action. In particular, statins exert antiinflammatory effects, modulate endothelial function, and inhibit the thrombotic signaling cascade. All together the non-LDL cholesterol-lowering effects of statins are called pleiotropic effects. In this article we will review the evidence supporting the use of high-dose statins in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, and we will also attempt to highlight the possible mechanisms of action.", 
    "222": "To explore whether long-term adherence to preventive statin therapy depends on socioeconomic position (SEP).", 
    "223": "A cohort of individuals without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes initiating preventive statin therapy during 2002-2005 was followed in the individual-level Danish registries for 4 years or until censoring events (death, emigration, CVD or diabetes). Only individuals aged 40-84 years for whom information was available on the SEP indicators, education and income were included (N = 76,038). Two different aspects of poor adherence were applied as outcome measures: (1) Proportion of days covered (PDC) with medication below 80 %, assuming a daily dose of one tablet (continuity); (2) Discontinuation defined as a gap between two consecutive prescriptions exceeding 365 days (persistence). Stratum-specific logistic regression analyses were applied to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for PDC <80 % across SEP, adjusting for age and hypertension. Hazard ratio (HR) for discontinuation was estimated by Cox regression analyses.", 
    "224": "Adjusting mutually for income and education, the OR for PDC <80 % decreased with increasing income. Comparing the highest income quintile with the lowest, the OR were 0.64 (95 % Confidence Interval 0.64-0.65) and 0.73 (0.73-0.74) in men aged 40-64 and 65-84 years, respectively; in women, the figures were 0.79 (0.79-0.79) and 0.95 (0.94-0.95), respectively. While observed increases in adherence with longer education in unadjusted analyses were attenuated after adjustment for income among men, the potential inverse relationship between length of education and adherence was enhanced among women. Applying discontinuation as outcome, analogous differences were demonstrated.", 
    "225": "Adherence to preventive statin therapy in Denmark decreases with decreasing income-especially in men aged 40-64\u00a0years."
