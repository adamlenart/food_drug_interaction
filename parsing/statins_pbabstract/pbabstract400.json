    "0": "Pravastatin sodium (pravastatin) is a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and was found to be highly effective in animals and humans, in lowering the plasma cholesterol level by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis selectively in the liver. In the present study the disposition and metabolism of pravastatin was studied in rats, dogs and monkeys using [14C]-labelled compound. The extent of absorption was approximately 70% in rats and 50% in dogs. Tissue distribution examined by both whole-body autoradiography and radioactivity measurement demonstrated that the drug was selectively taken up by the liver, a target organ of the drug, and excreted via bile mainly in unchanged form. Since pravastatin excreted by the bile was reabsorbed, the enterohepatic circulation maintained the presence of unchanged pravastatin in the target organ. The profiles of metabolites were studied in various tissues and excreta and a metabolic pathway of pravastatin was proposed.", 
    "1": "The efficacy, tolerability and safety of simvastatin in the treatment of hyperlipemia in uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis were evaluated in 6 patients; a further 6 patients were treated with placebo and represented the control group. All patients treated completed the study. No clinical or laboratory side-effects were noted during the entire period of observation. Simvastatin caused a significant 26% reduction in total cholesterol, a 36% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 28% reduction in triglycerides; HDL cholesterol and Apolipoprotein A increased by 19% and 12% respectively.", 
    "2": "A patient with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria was diagnosed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The patient had severe metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia and hyperammonemia and excreted abnormal amounts of 3-methylglutaconic, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 3-methylglutaric, 3-hydroxyisovaleric and glutaric acids in the urine. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid appeared as two peaks on the chromatogram after trimethylsilylation. One was a tri-trimethylsilyl and the other a di-trimethylsilyl derivative. 3-Methylglutaconic acid appeared as three peaks: cis-, trans- and cyclic cis-isomers. The structure of these derivatives was elucidated by deuterium-labeled trimethylsilyl derivatization. The di-trimethylsilyl derivative of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid and the cyclic cis-isomer of 3-methylglutaconic acid do not appear to have been previously described. After treatment with leucine restriction milk, the excretion of leucine catabolites decreased but 3-methylglutaconic and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acids continued to be excreted at abnormally high levels. It is concluded that these two metabolites are necessary for the chemical diagnosis of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency. This patient is the first case of HMG-CoA lyase deficiency to be reported in Japan.", 
    "3": "The sources of cholesterol for steroid hormone production were examined using bovine adrenocortical (BAC) cells in primary culture. The experiments were designed to determine the effects of lipoproteins on cortisol production and the level of BAC cell 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Most studies on BAC cell lipoprotein requirements have been conducted using human low-density lipoprotein (hHDL); none have used the homologous bovine lipoproteins. BAC cells treated with corticotropin (ACTH) in a medium devoid of lipoproteins increased and maintained cortisol production 7- to 20-fold above basal levels. Under such conditions ACTH also increased the rate of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase with mevinolin inhibited cortisol production by 85%, indicating that the cells were using cholesterol synthesized de novo for steroid production. Cortisol production was increased almost 40-fold above basal levels if hLDL (100 micrograms/ml) was included in the incubation medium. Human LDL also suppressed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase in a concentration-dependent fashion. Human HDL was without effect on either BAC cell steroidogenesis of HMG-CoA reductase. Addition of bovine LDL (bLDL) to the incubation medium also caused an increase in cortisol production and inhibited cholesterol synthesis. By contrast to hHDL, bHDL (100 micrograms/ml) increased the ability of BAC cells to produce cortisol production. Bovine HDL (bHDL) also was able to decrease HMG-CoA reductase, but not to the extent caused by hLDL or bLDL. These data demonstrate that bovine adrenal cells can use bHDL as a source of cholesterol for steroid hormone production. These findings may be of particular importance when one considers that in vivo, the bHDL content of bovine serum greatly surpasses the level of bLDL.", 
    "4": "Increased cellular Na+/H+ antiport activity has been documented in various cell types from hypertensive humans and rats. This membrane abnormality may be associated with the thickening of the vascular media of resistance vessels. Such an abnormality has also been demonstrated in cells from type I diabetic patients with nephropathy, and may indicate the predisposition to essential hypertension in such patients. We now demonstrate the importance of the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol and isoprenoid synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, in determining cellular Na+/H+ antiport activity. This finding may have application in the future treatment of diabetic patients with proteinuria.", 
    "5": "A method is described for the determination of the novel hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor RP 61969 (I) and its hydrolysis product, the dihydroxy acid RP 62420 (II), in human plasma. A structural isomer of I is used as internal standard. Both I and II were extracted from acidified plasma with diethyl ether. The dried residues were reconstituted in the high-performance liquid chromatography mobile phase and chromatographed on a 5 microns ODS2 column. The mobile phase used was aqueous dipotassium phosphate +tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (both 10 mM)-acetonitrile-methanol (60:40:5, v/v). At a flow-rate of 1.5 ml min-1 and ambient temperature, the retention time of II is 3.5 min, that of the internal standard is 5 min, and that of I is 8 min. The method has been validated and applied to the assay of plasma samples resulting from a cell-plasma distribution experiment in human whole blood.", 
    "6": "On repeated thawing at room temperature of frozen preparations of heavy microsomes from rat livers, HMGCoA reductase activity was solubilized due to limited proteolysis. This soluble enzyme was partially purified by fractionation with ammonium sulfate and filtration on Sephacryl S-200 column. The active enzyme was coeluted with a major 92 kDa-protein and was identified as a 58 kDa-protein after separation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Ethoxysilatrane, a hypocholesterolemic compound, which decreased the liver-microsomal activity of HMGCoA reductase on intra-peritonial treatment of animals, showed little effect on the enzyme activity with isolated microsomes or the 50 kDa-soluble enzyme when added in the assay. But it was able to inhibit the activity of the soluble 58 kDa-enzyme in a concentration-dependent, reversible manner. Cholesterol and an oxycholesterol were without effect whereas chlorophenoxyisobutyrate and ubiquinone showed small inhibition under these conditions. The extra region that links the active site domain (50 kDa protein) to the membrane, present in the 58 kDa-protein appears to be involved in mediating the inhibition by silatrane.", 
    "7": "Both eukaryotes and archaebacteria use 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase to synthesize mevalonate, which eukaryotes employ in the production of sterols and archaebacteria need for the isoprenoid side chains of their unique and characteristic lipids. The drug mevinolin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase in eukaryotes and in the halophilic archaebacteria, and we have used a spontaneous mutation to mevinolin resistance in the construction of a selectable shuttle vector for Haloferax volcanii. Sequence analysis shows that this resistance determinant encodes an HMG-CoA reductase very like its eukaryotic homologs, but sharing with the one sequenced eubacterial HMG-CoA reductase (that of Pseudomonas mevalonii) few residues other than those common to all HMG-CoA reductases. Characterization of several spontaneous mevinolin-resistant mutants reveals that they are of two sorts: amplifications of the HMG-CoA reductase gene with varying amounts of flanking sequence, and point mutants upstream of the HMG-CoA reductase coding region. We compared sequence and expression of a mutant gene of the latter class to those of the wild-type gene. The point mutation found affects the TATA box-like \"distal promoter element,\" results (like gene amplification) in resistance through the synthesis of excess gene product, and provides the first true genetic definition of an archaebacterial promoter.", 
    "8": "Familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with hypercholesterolaemia in which an aminoacid substitution in apoprotein B-100 leads to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles which have defective binding to the LDL receptor. All known patients are heterozygous, and their plasma contains normal and poorly binding LDL particles. 12 hypercholesterolaemic patients from 10 unrelated families with FDB were treated with lovastatin. In 6 patients treated with 20 mg lovastatin daily, LDL cholesterol decreased by 21.5% from 6.23 to 4.89 mmol/l (95% confidence interval 0.74, 1.96 mmol/l), whereas it fell by 32.1%, from 6.99 to 4.81 mmol/l (95% CI 1.55, 2.70 mmol/l), in 9 patients who received 40 mg daily. These results indicate that the hypercholesterolaemia of FDB may respond to treatment with statins.", 
    "9": "We have isolated clones of an established cell line which express defects in intracellular cholesterol metabolism. Chinese hamster ovary cells were mutagenized, and clones unable to mobilize low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol to the plasma membrane were selected. Biochemical analysis of two mutant clones revealed a phenotype characteristic of the lysosomal storage disease, Niemann-Pick type C. The mutant cell lines were found to be defective in the regulatory responses elicited by LDL-derived cholesterol. LDL-mediated stimulation of cholesterol esterification was grossly defective, and LDL suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase was impaired. However, the mutants modulated these activities normally in response to 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevalonate. The LDL-specific defects were predicated by the inability of these mutants to mobilize LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes. Cell fractionation studies showed that LDL-derived, unesterified cholesterol accumulated in the lysosomes of mutant cells to significantly higher levels than normal, commensurate with defective movement of cholesterol to other cellular membranes. Characterization of cell lines defective in intracellular cholesterol transport will facilitate identification of the gene(s) required for intracellular cholesterol movement and regulation.",

    "12": "Few data are available on the relative efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin and pravastatin, two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, currently available in North America for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The recommended starting dose is 20 mg QD with the evening meal for lovastatin. The recommended starting dose is 10 mg or 20 mg once daily at bedtime for pravastatin. In a double blind, double placebo, multicenter, randomized study, we compared the changes in plasma lipids and apolipoproteins in 217 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia treated for eight weeks with lovastatin 20 mg QD to pravastatin 10 mg QD or pravastatin 20 mg QD. The reductions in total cholesterol (TC) (21%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (28%), and apolipoprotein B (apo B) (22%) were comparable for the lovastatin 20-mg and pravastatin 20-mg groups. Lovastatin 20 mg QD was significantly more effective than pravastatin 10 mg QD in lowering TC and LDL-C after four weeks of therapy and in the reduction of apo B after four and eight weeks of therapy. At the end of eight weeks of therapy, the mean reductions in TC and LDL-C were numerically greater with lovastatin 20 mg QD compared with pravastatin 10 mg QD, but the differences were not statistically significant. At the end of eight weeks, there was no difference between pravastatin 20 mg and pravastatin 10 mg in lowering TC and LDL-C. The frequency of overall side effects, including central nervous system-related symptoms and headache, was similar and low in all groups.", 
    "13": "Fourteen women and five men participated in a 20-week controlled, cross-over trial of the interaction of simvastatin, an HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, with high and low fat diets. Simvastatin was found to be just as effective at lowering LDL cholesterol whether the subjects were on a 22% fat diet or a 38% fat diet (25% and 29% falls, respectively). Nevertheless, the lowest cholesterol levels were achieved by combining simvastatin with a low fat diet, the latter adding a further 5% reduction in plasma cholesterol. Simvastatin plus a low or high fat diet increased HDL cholesterol by 10.0% and 2.9% respectively (P = 0.003 overall) and reduced triglyceride concentration by 15.9% and 19% respectively (P less than 0.001). Significant diet-drug interactions were seen in LDL and HDL3 cholesterol. Simvastatin blunted the effect of dietary fat change so that the difference in LDL cholesterol, which was 0.71 mmol/l between high and low fat in the absence of simvastatin, was only 0.22 mmol/l with simvastatin. On a high fat diet, simvastatin produced almost no rise in HDL3 cholesterol whereas on a low fat diet HDL3 cholesterol was increased by 8.8% with simvastatin. The cholesterol content of VLDL and LDL were significantly reduced by simvastatin. The effects of diet and drug on apoproteins A-I and B resembles those on HDL and LDL cholesterol. The findings show interactions between simvastatin and dietary fat which have a bearing on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "14": "Oxidized LDL, which has been discovered in vivo in areas of proximity to the atherosclerotic lesion, has been shown to enhance macrophage cholesterol accumulation. We studied the anti-oxidant potential of pravastatin, bezafibrate and cholestyramine in 18 patients with hypercholesterolemia. In addition, we examined the electrophoretic mobility and the uptake of LDL by macrophages before and after drug therapy. Pravastatin lowered plasma levels of LDL cholesterol by 57%, cholestyramine by 27% and bezafibrate by 25%. Pravastatin and bezafibrate also altered the composition of LDL as evidenced by the reduction of its cholesterol/apo B100 ratio. Pravastatin and bezafibrate reduced plasma triglyceride levels by 45% and 25%, respectively, whereas cholestyramine raised plasma triglyceride concentrations by 28%. LDL propensity for in vitro oxidation was analyzed following lipoprotein incubation with 10 microM copper ions and determination of LDL malondialdehyde (MDA), peroxides (PD) and conjugated dienes (CD) content. All drugs inhibited the susceptibility to in vitro oxidation of LDL isolated after drug therapy in comparison to LDL isolated before commencing drug therapy. Pravastatin reduced MDA content by 22%, PD by 18% and CD by 20%. Cholestyramine reduced LDL content of MDA by 41%, PD by 25% and CD by 63%. Bezafibrate reduced MDA by 41%, PD by 38% and CD by 45%. LDL vitamin E content was reduced after treatment with bezafibrate, pravastatin and cholestyramine by 49%, 36% and 8%, respectively. The electrophoretic mobility of LDL after all drug therapies was reduced in comparison to LDL obtained before therapy. Macrophage uptake of LDL assessed by either the cellular cholesterol esterification rate or by lipoprotein degradation was not affected by drug therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "The proliferative rate as well as the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase, which regulates de novo synthesis of mevalonate, was comparable in the two human breast cancer cell lines Hs578T and MDA-231 when cultured in the presence of serum. Upon treatment with mevinolin (an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor) the proliferation of the cell lines was depressed with similar dose response kinetics. A depression of the enzymatic activity to a level of 1-1.5 pmol mevalonate/min/mg protein decreased DNA-synthesis by approximately 90%. In contrast, at slightly higher enzymatic activities, ie 2-2.5 pmol/min/mg protein, there was only a mild decrease in DNA-synthesis. Addition of mevalonate to a final concentrations of 0.77 mM completely prevented the mevinolin-induced block on cell proliferation in both cell lines. Exposure to serum-free medium caused by itself a depression of HMG CoA reductase activity to 2.5-3 pmol/min/mg protein in both cell lines. Whereas the proliferation of MDA-231 was not inhibited at all by serum depletion, this treatment decreased DNA-synthesis in Hs578T by nearly 80%. Interestingly, the addition of mevalonate also prevented this growth inhibition in Hs578T, irrespective of whether mevinolin was present or not. However, this required a 30-fold increase in the mevalonate concentration (23.1 mM) as compared to MDA-231. The present data indicate that mevalonate is not only necessary for cell proliferation, but also that mevalonate is involved in the serum-dependent control of cell proliferation in serum-sensitive cells. In this respect, serum seems to affect the utilization of mevalonate in the formation of mevalonate-derived growth-regulatory molecules, rather than regulating the de novo synthesis of mevalonate.", 
    "16": "In 10 hypercholesterolemic patients with Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes, simvastatin 10-40 mg/day was compared to placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study with treatment periods of 12 weeks. Between each treatment there was a wash-out period of 4 weeks. Compared to placebo, simvastatin reduced total cholesterol by 19% (p less than 0.001) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 24% (p less than 0.001). Simvastatin therapy reduced plasma triglyceride by 8% and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 8%, but neither of these alterations was significant (p greater than 0.05). Diabetic control and daily requirement of insulin were not influenced by simvastatin. In six patients, all men, there were no alterations in the concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate, testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, luteinizing hormone or follicle-stimulating hormone, while sex hormone-binding globulin was significantly (19% (p less than 0.05)) reduced during therapy with simvastatin. Thus, in Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients, simvastatin causes significant reductions in plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol which are similar in magnitude to those observed in non-diabetics. This favourable effect can be obtained without any concomitant negative influence on glucose regulation or total gonadal steroid hormone concentrations.", 
    "17": "Under experimental conditions, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) may possess atherogenic properties, as is evidenced by its contribution to cholesterol accumulation in macrophages. LDL was oxidized in a cell-free system by predialysis of the lipoprotein against EDTA-free buffer and the addition of copper ions. Oxidation of LDL in the presence of lovastatin (10 to 1,000 mumol/L) resulted in a time- and dose-dependent reduction in thiobarbituric-acid-reactive substances (TBARS) concentration that was accompanied by increased LDL lysine-amino-group reactivity, in comparison with Ox-LDL produced in the absence of lovastatin. At 100 mumol/L, the drug reduced malondialdehyde concentration and increased amino-group reactivity by 24% and 42%, respectively. However, lovastatin's antioxidant effect was limited relative to other antioxidants, such as probucol and vitamin E. The fluidity of Ox-LDL was substantially reduced in comparison with native LDL. However, lovastatin inhibited this reduction in fluidity by 20%. Upon incubation of J-774 macrophage-like cell line with Ox-LDL, the lovastatin-treated Ox-LDL induced a reduction in the cellular cholesterol esterification rate in comparison with the effect of Ox-LDL that was produced in the absence of the drug. In four patients with hypercholesterolemia, the effect of lovastatin therapy (20 mg/d) on the sensitivity of their LDL to in vitro oxidation was studied. In all patients, Ox-LDL prepared from LDL obtained during lovastatin treatment demonstrated a reduced TBARS content, an increased trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) reactivity, an increased fluidity, and an impaired uptake by macrophages. These results were similar to those obtained by adding lovastatin in vitro.", 
    "18": "Lovastatin and simvastatin are the first licensed compounds of a potent new class of lipid lowering drugs whose mechanism of action is to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in the liver. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis leads to upregulation of LDL-receptors in the liver and subsequent increased LDL clearance. Both agents are pro-drugs (lactones) which undergo extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism to the beta-hydroxyl acid form. These drugs are liver specific and have low systemic exposure as open-acid forms (plasma concentration < 5% of oral dose). Thus, theoretically both drugs have low potential for systemic adverse events. They are potent and effective agents for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia. The adverse experiences reported for both drugs demonstrate an excellent safety profile.", 
    "19": "Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia frequently coexist and may require concomitant drug treatments. The efficacy and safety profile of lovastatin given in the presence of antihypertensive medication was evaluated using patient subgroups identified in the Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin (EXCEL) Study. The EXCEL study examined 8,245 patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia randomly assigned either to a group treated with lovastatin (20-80 mg daily) or to a group given placebo for 48 weeks. After adjustment for patient characteristics, pairwise comparisons were made between patients taking no antihypertensive agents (n = 3,772) and those taking either calcium antagonists (n = 446), selective beta 1-adrenergic receptor blockers (n = 326), nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (n = 219), potassium-sparing diuretics (n = 187), thiazide diuretics (n = 126), or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 171). The placebo-corrected dose-dependent effect of lovastatin on the percent change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not attenuated in any subgroup and was slightly enhanced in the calcium antagonist subgroup (-29% to -44%, p = 0.06) when compared with patients taking no antihypertensive agents (-24% to -40%); this difference, however, was only of borderline significance. Patterns of lovastatin-induced increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and decrease in triglycerides were not consistently different among the subgroups. Examination of mean changes in serum transaminases, mean changes in creatine kinase, and the proportion of patients discontinuing therapy for clinical adverse experiences did not indicate the presence of an interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "p21ras and several other ras-related GTP-binding proteins are modified post-translationally by addition of 15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoids to cysteines within a conserved carboxyl-terminal sequence motif, Caa(M/S/L), where a is an aliphatic amino acid. Proteins ending with M or S are substrates for farnesyltransferase, whereas those ending with L are modified preferentially by geranylgeranyltransferase. We recently reported that GTP-binding proteins encoded by rab1B (GGCC), rab2 (GGCC), and rab5 (CCSN) are modified by 20-carbon isoprenyl derivatives of [3H]mevalonate when translated in vitro, despite having carboxyl-terminal sequences distinct from the Caa(M/S/L) motif. We now show that these proteins function as specific acceptors for geranylgeranyl in vitro and are modified by 20-carbon isoprenyl groups in COS cells metabolically labeled with [3H]mevalonate. Proteins encoded by rab4 and rab6, with yet another distinct carboxyl-terminal motif (xCxC), are similarly modified by 20-carbon isoprenoids in vitro and in vivo. The geranylgeranyl modification of rab5 protein (CCSN) is catalyzed by an enzyme in brain cytosol but not by a purified geranylgeranyltransferase that modifies GTP-binding proteins with the CaaL motif. Unlike the prenylation of proteins with Caa(M/S/L) termini, the prenylation of rab5 protein is not inhibited by a synthetic peptide based on its carboxyl-terminal sequence (TRNQCCSN). When cellular isoprenoid synthesis is blocked by treatment of cells with lovastatin, rab proteins that are normally localized in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and endosomes accumulate in the cytosol. This change in rab protein localization is reversed by providing cells with mevalonate. These findings suggest that geranylgeranyl modification underlies the ability of rab GTP-binding proteins to associate with intracellular membranes, where they are postulated to function as mediators of vesicular traffic.", 
    "21": "The transport mechanism of pravastatin, a new cholesterol-lowering drug, was compared in vitro with rat hepatocyte primary culture and mouse skin fibroblasts (L-cells). The uptake of 14C-labeled pravastatin by cultured hepatocytes was temperature- and dose-dependent. The temperature-dependent uptake as a function of [14C]pravastatin concentration showed saturation kinetics with Km = 32.2 microM and a maximal uptake rate of 68 pmol/mg protein/min. The uptake of pravastatin was inhibited significantly by metabolic inhibitors such as rotenone, oligomycin A, antimycin A, 2,4-dinitrophenol and KCN. Unlabeled pravastatin as well as R-416 and R-195, structural analogues of pravastatin, effectively competed for the hepatic uptake of [14C]pravastatin at 37 degrees. These results indicate that pravastatin is taken up by the liver by an active transport. In contrast, the transport of pravastatin by L-cells was temperature-independent and non-saturable, suggesting that the uptake of pravastatin by L-cells is mediated by passive diffusion. The marked difference in the uptake mechanism of pravastatin between hepatocytes and L-cells may account for a unique feature of this drug in that the uptake and inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis occur selectively in the liver.", 
    "22": "Cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated for each of 2 plasma cholesterol-lowering drug therapies, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin and the well established cholestyramine, in comparison with a nonpreventive drug treatment alternative. The study was confined to Swedish men (aged 37 to 64 years at start of therapy) with total serum cholesterol levels above 6.2 mmol/L who were free of coronary artery disease (CAD). Costs included expected direct costs of plasma cholesterol-lowering treatment less expected savings resulting from preventing CAD. Effects were defined as changes in life expectancy. A discount rate of 5% and Swedish kronor (SEK) 1988 prices were used. The impact on CAD risks was calculated using multivariate logistic risk estimates from the Framingham Heart Study; Swedish estimates were used to calculate intervention costs and changes in healthcare costs. Over the range of cholesterol levels examined (6.2 to 9.8 mmol/L), simvastatin was consistently more cost-effective than cholestyramine.", 
    "23": "We report that the sterol-mediated suppression of the mRNA levels of three cholesterogenic enzymes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthetase is partially overcome by the calcium ionophore A23187. Addition of A23187 to the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 in the presence of fetal calf serum led to rapid increases in mRNA concentration of up to 40-fold for HMG-CoA synthase and 15-fold for HMG-CoA reductase with little or no change in FPP synthetase mRNA levels. Treatment of HepG2 cells with A23187 resulted in approximately 2-4-fold increases in the mRNA levels for these three enzymes. The increases in HMG-CoA synthase and HMG-CoA reductase mRNAs were maximal after treatment of THP-1 cells with 10 micrograms/ml A23187 for 3 h. The stimulation was blocked by actinomycin D but not by cycloheximide treatment. Ionophore treatment had no effect on the half-lives of the mRNAs for HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase. Surprisingly, the addition of A23187 to THP-1 cells incubated in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonic acid also led to significant increases in the mRNA levels for HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase. Finally, the stimulation of these mRNA levels by A23187 was reduced in cells in which protein kinase C had been inactivated by preincubation of the cells with a phorbol ester. Taken together, these data suggest that A23187 treatment results in increased transcription of HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, and, in some cell types, FPP synthetase by a mechanism that does not involve de novo protein synthesis. We speculate that A23187 treatment results in the modification of a trans-acting factor(s) which is common for the transcription of all these genes.", 
    "24": "Topical solvent treatment removes lipids from the stratum corneum leading to a marked increase in transepidermal water loss (TEWL). This disturbance stimulates a variety of metabolic changes in the epidermis leading to rapid repair of the barrier defect. Using an immersion system we explored the nature of the signal leading to barrier repair in intact mice. Initial experiments using hypotonic to hypertonic solutions showed that water transit per se was not the crucial signal. However, addition of calcium at concentrations as low as 0.01 mM inhibited barrier repair. Moreover, both verapamil and nifedipine, which block calcium transport into cells, prevented the calcium-induced inhibition of TEWL recovery. Additionally, trifluoroperazine or N-6-aminohexyl-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide, which inhibit calmodulin, prevented the calcium-induced inhibition of TEWL recovery. Although these results suggest an important role for calcium in barrier homeostasis, calcium alone was only modestly effective in inhibiting TEWL recovery. Potassium alone (10 mM) and phosphate alone (5 mM) also produced a modest inhibition of barrier repair. Together, however, calcium and potassium produced a synergistic inhibition of barrier repair (control 50% recovery vs. calcium + potassium 0-11% recovery in 2.5 h). Furthermore, in addition to inhibiting TEWL recovery, calcium and potassium also prevented the characteristic increase in 3-hydroxy-3-glutaryl CoA reductase activity that occurs after barrier disruption. Finally, the return of lipids to the stratum corneum was also blocked by calcium and potassium. These results demonstrate that the repair of the epidermal permeability barrier after solvent disruption can be prevented by calcium, potassium, and phosphate. The repair process may be signalled by a decrease in the concentrations of these ions in the upper epidermis resulting from increased water flux leading to passive loss of these ions.", 
    "25": "1. CoA-thioether analogues of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA containing an additional methyl group at positions 2, 6(methyl at C3) or 4 of the acyl residue were prepared. To probe for hydrophobic interaction, their inhibitory properties were determined with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase purified from baker's yeast. The CoA-thioethers were purely competitive inhibitors whose affinity to the reductase was near to that of the physiological substrate. 2. CoA-sulfoxides derived from the CoA-thioethers displayed affinities to the reductase superior to that of the physiological substrate (Km = 7 microM). Depending on the degree of recognition of diastereomers by the enzyme, the inhibitor constants of the two best inhibitors vary from Ki = 200 nM and Ki = 80 nM (diastereomeric mixtures) to 25 nM and 20 nM, respectively (if only one diastereomer would interact with the enzyme).", 
    "26": "This study was designed to examine the state of proliferation in the rat thyrocyte following the administration of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). An immunohistochemical technique involving the use of a monoclonal antibody to statin, a nonproliferation-specific nuclear antigen, was developed to measure the subpopulation of cells that have ceased to divide. Following the random assignment of young male Sprague-Dawley rats into various groups, the rats in the control group received a single intraperitoneal (i-p) injection of normal saline, whereas the experimental groups received single i-p injections of TSH at doses of 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 IU, respectively. All rats were subsequently sacrificed in groups of three at 1, 2, 4, and 24 hours. The statin antibody label was readily identified within the follicle cell nucleus. Results revealed a statistically significant transient decrease in the mean percent statin-positive nuclei in the TSH-treated groups. The time- and dose-dependent effect of TSH was maximal at 2 hours and no longer discernible at 24 hours. A second experiment involving the chronic administration of TSH (i-p 0.25 IU twice daily) resulted in a cumulative response with a statistically significant progressive decrease in the mean percent of statin-positive nuclei at 5 and 10 days, returning to near normal values 5 days following the cessation of treatment. Determination of the nuclear optical density of the statin reaction product by image analysis techniques revealed that a single injection of TSH resulted in a rapid disappearance of the statin nuclear protein. This result suggests that the disappearance of statin in the nucleus appears to reflect the event of cells leaving the nondividing quiescent state to resume the cell cycle traverse following the administration of TSH. The disappearance of statin appears as an early nuclear event that parallels the earliest known cytoplasmic pinocytotic response to TSH in the rat thyroid follicle cell.", 
    "27": "Recent studies have shown that increased epidermal 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase activity is crucial for the barrier recovery response that follows solvent-induced barrier perturbation. Upregulation of this enzyme leads to increased cholesterologenesis, formation and secretion of cholesterol-enriched lamellar bodies, and barrier repair. Topical lovastatin-induced inhibition of HMG CoA reductase activity both delays the acute barrier-repair response, as well as leading to a chronic barrier abnormality when applied repeatedly to intact skin. Presently, we assessed the effects of repeated topical applications of two different specific inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase on barrier function, the lamellar body-secretory system, and stratum corneum intercellular domains, with functional and morphologic parameters. Once-daily applications of lovastatin or fluindostatin (XU62-320; Sandoz) for 4-8 d to intact hairless mouse epidermis produced a progressive abnormality in barrier function (transepidermal water loss greater than 2.0-5.0 in treated versus less than 0.25 mg/cm2/h for weakly active analogues or vehicle controls). The barrier defect was preceded by alterations in lamellar body internal structure and a partial failure of lamellar body secretion into the stratum corneum interstices, further confirmed by enzyme cytochemistry. Moreover, the deposition of abnormal lamellar body contents resulted in the formation of clefts in the intercellular spaces at the stratum granulosum-stratum corneum interface, resulting in increased permeability through these domains shown by lanthanum perfusion. Applications of irritants, even when producing a barrier abnormality, did not alter the lamellar body secretory system. Co-applications of cholesterol with the inhibitors reversed both the barrier abnormality and the abnormalities in the lamellar body secretory system that occur with the inhibitor alone. Finally, membrane bilayer structures in the mid-to-outer stratum corneum of inhibitor-treated specimens appeared normal, but the intercellular domains displayed enormously expanded lacunae. However, because similar dilatations also occurred in vehicle-treated samples, they can be attributed to the vehicle alone. These studies provide further evidence that the inhibitor-induced defect in barrier function a) is initiated by inhibition of HMG CoA reductase; b) can be attributed to defects in both lamellar body structure and deposition with resultant abnormalities in intercellular membrane domains in the lower stratum corneum; and c) is further enhanced by permissive effects of the vehicle on the permeability of the outer stratum corneum.", 
    "28": "Twelve healthy male volunteers received single market-image 40-mg oral doses of lovastatin and simvastatin (both lactone prodrugs), or pravastatin (a beta-hydroxyacid) at 1 week intervals in a three-way crossover study to quantify HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in plasma. Multiple plasma samples were collected up to 24 hours after the dose and assayed for active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. After equal oral doses, higher plasma concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity after pravastatin than after either lovastatin of simvastatin (2-3 fold greater area under the concentration-time curve) suggest a greater potential availability of pravastatin-related inhibitory activity to peripheral tissues.", 
    "29": "The disposition of a single 20-mg oral dose of pravastatin was assessed in subjects with various degrees of renal function. Sixteen subjects (13 males, 3 females) with creatinine clearance values ranging from 15 to 112 mL/min/1.73 m2 completed the study. Area under the serum concentration-time curve, maximum serum concentration, time to maximum serum concentration, terminal serum elimination half-life, apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution for pravastatin were not affected by renal impairment, whereas the renal clearance of pravastatin decreased as creatinine clearance decreased (r2 = 0.697, P less than .001). The area under the serum concentration-time curve and time to maximum serum concentration of SQ 31,945 (a hepatic metabolite) increased in patients with renal impairment, whereas the terminal elimination rate constant and renal clearance of SQ 31,945 significantly decreased as a function of creatinine clearance. The renal clearance of another metabolite (SQ 31,906) also significantly declined with decreasing renal function. This single-dose study demonstrates that pravastatin pharmacokinetics were not affected in patients with renal impairment, probably because of its dual route of elimination.", 
    "30": "A methodology based on molecular modeling and chemometrics is applied to identify the geometrical pharmacophore and the stereoelectronic requirements for the activity in a series of inhibitors of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. These inhibitors present two common structural features - a 3,5-dihydroxy hepatanoic acid which mimics the active portion of the natural substrate HMG-CoA and a lipophilic region which carries both polar and bulky groups. A total of 432 minimum energy conformations of 11 homologous compounds showing different levels of biological activity are calculated by the molecular mechanics MM2 method. Five atoms are selected as representatives of the relevant fragments of these compounds and three interatomic distances, selected among 10 by means of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), are used to describe the three-dimensional disposition of these atoms. A cluster analysis procedure, performed on the whole set of conformations described by these three distances, allows the selection of one cluster whose centroid represents a geometrical model for the HMG-CoA reductase pharmacophore and the conformations included are candidates as binding conformations. To obtain a refinement of the geometrical model and to have a better insight into the requirements for the activity of these inhibitors, the Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) distributions are determined by the MNDO semiempirical method.", 
    "31": "Topical lovastatin stimulates epidermal fatty acid synthesis in vivo; therefore, studies were undertaken to examine the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on fatty acid metabolism in cultured keratinocytes. When exposed to fluindostatin or lovastatin for greater than or equal to 24 h, keratinocytes in serum-free media accumulated nile red-fluorescent lipid droplets. By 72 h, the triacylglycerol and phospholipid content were increased 2.5- and 1.3-fold, respectively. Reductase inhibitors (1-10 microM) increased fatty acid synthesis approximately 1.5-fold; increased synthesis was noted only after greater than 15 h exposure and was distributed among phospholipids and triacylglycerols. Oxidation of [14C]palmitate to CO2 was decreased greater than 50% in inhibitor-treated cultures, and label accumulated in triacylglycerols. Inhibitor-treated keratinocytes exhibited increased numbers of peroxisomes, using diaminobenzidene ultracytochemistry. Peroxisomal hyperplasia was also demonstrated by increased catalase activity (1.5- to 2.5-fold), increased dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase activity (1.4-fold) and increased peroxisomal (KCN-insensitive) fatty acid oxidation (1.4-fold) in inhibitor-treated cultures. Thus HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors increase fatty acid synthesis, induce triacylglycol and phospholipid accumulation, and induce peroxisomes in cultured keratinocytes. Coincubations with either low density lipoproteins or 25-hydroxycholesterol prevented both the peroxisomal hyperplasia and increased fatty acid synthesis, suggesting that these effects of reductase inhibitors may be linked to their effects on the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.",

    "36": "In 43 patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) associated with hypercholesterolemia, the effect of pravastatin, a potent HMG CoA-reductase inhibitor, on serum lipids, apolipoproteins and lipoprotein (a) was examined. After 1 to 3 months administration of 10 mg per day of pravastatin, the serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were significantly decreased, while the serum level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was significantly increased in patients with NIDDM. The levels of apolipoproteins B (apo B) and E were significantly decreased, while apolipoprotein AI (apo A-I) was not changed by the administration of pravastatin. The atherogenic indices (LDL-C/HDL-C and apo B/apo A-I) were significantly decreased by the administration of this drug. The serum lipoprotein (a), which was increased in the diabetic patients, was not affected by the pravastatin treatment. Plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were not affected by the treatment. We concluded that pravastatin is a potentially useful agent in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients with NIDDM.",

Fifty-seven New Zealand rabbits in six groups were fed a 0.3% cholesterol diet for 10 weeks. In the progression phase of the study, group C10 served as a control and received 1 ml of DMSO daily by gavage. Two other groups, L10 and H10, received low (L)-dose (10 mg/day) or high (H)-dose (20 mg/day) lovastatin dissolved in 1 ml of DMSO for 10 weeks. In the regression phase of the study, three groups of rabbits received the high lipid diet for 10 weeks and were then shifted to a normal diet for the second 10 weeks. During the second 10 weeks, the control group C20 received 1 ml of DMSO daily, and groups L20 and H20 received 10 and 20 mg/day of lovastatin by gavage, respectively. In the progression phase of the study, lovastatin significantly attenuated the percent of aortic lesions in groups L10 (8 +/- 7%) and H10 (9 +/- 14%) vs. the control group C10 (31 +/- 17%; p less than 0.01). There was a similar reduction in pulmonary lesions in groups L10 (10 +/- 6%) and H10 (4 +/- 5%) compared to the control group C10 (30 +/- 16%; p less than 0.01). There was also a reduction in plaque thickness in both the aorta and pulmonary artery, and hence an even greater reduction in estimated plaque volume. In the regression phase of the study, lovastatin also significantly reduced the percent of aortic lesions (groups L20 and H20 vs. C20: 27 +/- 18 and 22 +/- 7% vs. 40 +/- 17%; p less than 0.05) and pulmonary lesions (21 +/- 10 and 17 +/- 6% vs. 26 +/- 9%; p greater than 0.05 and p less than 0.05, respectively); the average maximum plaque thickness of aorta (0.24 and 0.26 mm vs. 0.49 mm; p less than 0.01); and the standardized plaque volume per unit area of aorta (4.5 and 3.4 vs. 12.1 mm-%; p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in the percent of aortic lesions between groups L20 and H20 and group C10 (27 +/- 18 and 22 +/- 7 vs. 31 +/- 17%; p greater than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "38": "1. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase was purified to homogeneity, in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors, from rat liver sampled without freeze-clamping. The enzyme was in a highly phosphorylated state (4.8 mol/subunit) of low specific activity, and could be dramatically reactivated by treatment with protein phosphatase-2A. Amino acid sequencing and fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry showed that the enzyme was phosphorylated in Ser79, Ser1200 and Ser1215, the three sites known to be phosphorylated in cell-free assays by the AMP-activated protein kinase. 2. The inactive enzyme could also be completely reactivated using a limited treatment with trypsin, which removes the N-terminal segment containing Ser79 and reduces the phosphate content to 3.5 mol/subunit. These results strengthen previous findings that it is phosphorylation at Ser79 by the AMP-activated protein kinase that is responsible for the inactivation, and not the phosphorylation of the 220-kDa core fragment (which contains Ser1200 and Ser1215). 3. Analysis of the phosphorylation state of Ser79 in acetyl-CoA carboxylase from rat liver showed that phosphorylation occurs post mortem if freeze-clamping is not used. The higher phosphorylation observed in extracts made without freeze-clamping correlates with a large increase in AMP and decrease in ATP (presumably caused by hypoxia during removal of the liver), and with increased activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase. These results provide a rational explanation for the post mortem phosphorylation events, and re-emphasize the point that rapid cooling of cells and tissues is essential when measuring the expressed activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (as well as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase). 4. Using the freeze-clamping procedure, the ratio of 'expressed' activity (measured in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors) to 'total' activity (measured after complete dephosphorylation) of rat liver acetyl-CoA carboxylase showed a marked diurnal rhythm, changing from 50% in the active form in the middle of the dark period to less than 10% active in the middle of the light period. The very low activity in the light period was associated with a high level of phosphorylation in Ser79. This diurnal rhythm is very similar to that previously described for the phosphorylation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, another substrate for the AMP-activated protein kinase. Neither the activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase nor the content of AMP, ADP or ATP changed between the dark or light periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "39": "The formation of oxygen radicals by phagocytic cells occurs through the activation of a multiple-component NADPH oxidase system. An unidentified low molecular weight GTP-binding protein has been proposed to modulate the activity of the NADPH oxidase. The low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins undergo posttranslational processing, including an initial covalent incorporation of an isoprenyl group. To test whether such an isoprenylation reaction might be required for the activity of the oxidase, we utilized compactin and lovastatin as inhibitors of the isoprenylation pathway. Treatment of DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells with compactin produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of O2- formation in response to FMLP or phorbol myristate acetate. Cell viability was not affected nor was normal differentiation of the HL-60 cells into a neutrophil-like cell. The inhibitory effect of compactin was specifically prevented by addition of exogenous mevalonic acid to the HL-60 cells, indicating that the inhibitory effects of the drug were due to blockade of the pathway leading to isoprenoid synthesis. Addition of cholesterol, ubiquinone, or dolichol, which are also downstream products of the isoprenoid pathway, did not override the inhibitory effects of the drug. Subcellular fractions were prepared from compactin-treated cells, and the location of the compactin-sensitive factor was determined by complementation analysis in a cell-free NADPH oxidase system. The inhibited factor was localized to the HL-60 cytosol. These data suggest that an isoprenoid pathway intermediate is necessary for activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. This is likely to represent the requirement for an isoprenoid moiety in the posttranslational modification of a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein. Our studies provide support for the involvement of such a low molecular weight GTP-binding protein in NADPH oxidase activation.", 
    "40": "Simvastatin is an effective hypocholesterolemic drug that inhibits cholesterol synthesis selectively in the liver, but could have potential side effects on the adrenal gland, ovary, and testis, as these three glands use cholesterol for their hormonal biosynthesis. In this report, we examined adrenal and sex steroids in 10 type IIA hypercholesterolemic patients (three with familial [FH] and seven with polygenic hypercholesterolemia) over a period of 1 year on simvastatin therapy in order to confirm in vivo its selective action. Furthermore, we evaluated the adrenal reserve by a corticotropin rapid test, before starting treatment and again at the end of the third month on 20 mg of simvastatin per day, then at the sixth and 12th month on 40 mg/d. There was a significant lowering of total cholesterol (TC) (-31%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (-39%), and apolipoprotein (apo) B (-39%); no statistically significant differences were seen in cortisol response to the corticotropin test between baseline and simvastatin-treated patients. No variation of any sex steroid was observed in patients of either gender. We conclude that long-term therapy with high-dose simvastatin does not interfere with either adrenocortical function or sex hormone production.", 
    "41": "In human vascular smooth muscle cells cyclic AMP elevation by forskolin increases synthesis of the LDL receptor by a mechanism which appears independent of sterol control. This increased receptor synthesis is further enhanced by chloroquine. Both forskolin and prostaglandin E1 increase the number of cell surface LDL receptors indicating that prostaglandins could exert physiological control over LDL metabolism. This effect is enhanced synergistically by chloroquine. The stimulation by forskolin of LDL receptor synthesis and expression leads to increased metabolism of apo-B and increased hydrolysis of LDL-borne cholesteryl ester. These effects of cyclic AMP on the activity of the LDL pathway are enhanced more than additively by preincubation with the reversible lysosomal inhibitor NH4Cl. Thus cyclic AMP causes up-regulation of the LDL receptor pathway resulting in increased rates of LDL metabolism but this effect can be damped or masked in cell culture by a cyclic AMP-sensitive lysosomal event, probably the acute stimulation of lysosomal cholesterol ester hydrolase.", 
    "42": "Since cholesterol biosynthesis is an integral part of cellular metabolism, several HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were systematically analyzed in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo sterol synthesis assays using [14C]acetate incorporation into digitonin precipitable sterols as a marker of cholesterol synthesis. Tissue distribution of radiolabeled CI-981 and lovastatin was also performed. In vitro, CI-981 and PD134967-15 were equipotent in liver, spleen, testis and adrenal, lovastatin was more potent in extrahepatic tissues than liver and BMY21950, pravastatin and PD135023-15 were more potent in liver than peripheral tissues. In ex vivo assays, all inhibitors except lovastatin preferentially inhibited liver sterol synthesis; however, pravastatin and BMY22089 were strikingly less potent in the liver. CI-981 inhibited sterol synthesis in vivo in the liver, spleen and adrenal while not affecting the testis, kidney, muscle and brain. Lovastatin inhibited sterol synthesis to a greater extent than CI-981 in the spleen, adrenal and kidney while pravastatin and BMY22089 primarily affected liver and kidney. The tissue distribution of radiolabeled CI-981 and lovastatin support the changes observed in tissue sterol synthesis. Thus, we conclude that a spectrum of liver selective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors exist and that categorizing agents as liver selective is highly dependent upon method of analysis.", 
    "43": "Previously, we reported a rat S1 protein that is antigenically related to statin, a nonproliferating cell-specific marker; however, it shares high homology with the known human elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha). To differentiate S1 from rat EF-1 alpha and to study their respective regulation for expression, a rat EF-1 alpha cDNA clone was isolated and characterized. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of this partial rat EF-1 alpha cDNA are compared with that of human and mouse as well as with rat S1. Both their messages were detected in rat brain by EF-1 alpha- or S1-specific probes. However, the mRNA encoding EF-1 alpha is more abundant than that encoding S1. S1 and EF-1 alpha expression were investigated in the parotid and submandibular glands of untreated rats and those treated with isoproterenol, a proliferation-inducing catecholamine. Quantitative solution hybridization demonstrated a dramatic reduction (approximately 68%) in the S1 mRNA following isoproterenol injection in proliferation-responsive parotid glands and a mild reduction (approximately 20%) of S1 steady-state messages in the proliferation-refractile submandibular glands. A slight increase or no changes of EF-1 alpha levels in both parotid and submandibular glands following isoproterenol treatment are also observed. Therefore, the EF-1 alpha and S1 genes are different genes, both expressed and regulated in vivo, but in differential quantitative and qualitative patterns.", 
    "44": "The authors studied the effect of lovastatin on five hypercholesterolemic CAPD patients with high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Patients took lovastatin 20 mg once daily for a mean period of 4.5 months. Pre- and post-treatment values of LDL and VLDL totals (325 mg/dl and 292 mg/dl, respectively) and of HDL (42 mg/dl and 43 mg/dl, respectively) had no significant statistical difference. Lack of significance may be due to low number of patients and short trial time. The study did demonstrate that lovastatin is well tolerated in CAPD patients.", 
    "45": "Epidemiological and intervention study results support reduction of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, and hence direct and indirect costs, by lowering plasma lipids. Cost-effectiveness of a lipid-lowering strategy thus depends significantly on the extent of plasma lipid decrease achieved. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin is a well tolerated and highly effective antihyperlipidaemic agent. Despite a current lack of direct evidence that simvastatin reduces CHD incidence, the cost-effectiveness of the drug {in terms of years of life saved (YOLS)} has been studied, based on findings of epidemiological trials. Simvastatin 20 mg/day is more cost-effective than cholestyramine 4g 3 times daily, particularly in men and in those with a higher pretreatment cholesterol level ( greater than 8 mmol/L) and other risk factors. Cost-effectiveness is also enhanced if treatment is started at a younger age (35 to 45 years) and maintained for a defined period rather than lifelong. Thus, while additional direct comparative studies are needed to confirm this finding, present evidence suggests simvastatin is a cost-effective intervention in appropriately selected patients.", 
    "46": "In mouse hepatoma Hepa-1c1c7 cultures, polycyclic aromatic compounds such as benzol[a]pyrene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD; dioxin) activate the Cyp1a-1 (cytochrome P(1)450) and Nmo-1[NAD(P)H:menadione-oxidoreductase] genes, two members of the aromatic hydrocarbon (Ah)-responsive gene battery. Mevinolin is known to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (EC 1.1.1.34), the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. We show here that in the absence of TCDD, mevinolin markedly increases Cyp1a-1 transcription, CYP1A1 mRNA and protein levels and enzyme activity, and NMO1 mRNA concentrations. Addition of mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, fails to reverse the effects of mevinolin. In fact, when used at high concentrations, mevalonate activates Cyp1a-1 transcription. Mevinolin-induced Cyp1a-1 gene activation: (1) occurs independently of the lipid content of the growth medium, (2) is not suppressed by adding 25-hydroxycholesterol, which blocks MHG-CoA reductase activity, and (3) requires a functional Ah receptor and unimpaired nuclear translocation of the receptor. It is possible that an unknown metabolite (or metabolites) of mevinolin activates Cyp1a-1 expression and that high concentrations of mevalonate act via the same mechanism. Using chimaeric plasmids that contain different lengths of Cyp1a-1 5' flanking regions fused to the bacterial neomycin (neo) gene, we find that the mevinolin effect on Cyp1a-1 induction requires the 5' flanking sequences between -1647 and -824, which are also needed for TCDD induction. Mevinolin, however, is not a ligand for the Ah receptor. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that Cyp1a-1 activation caused by mevinolin does not involve the ligand-dependent formation of a functional Ah receptor-dependent DNA-binding complex, but instead appears to be correlated with release of a putative repressor from its cognate DNA site. Our results suggest that the basel level of Cyp1a-1 transcription is maintained by an unknown negative regulatory factor. We propose that Cyp1a-1 transcriptional activation can result not only from induction by polycyclic aromatic compounds but also from derepression by mevinolin, independent of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.", 
    "47": "Hyperlipidemia may be one of the risk factors in the development of atherosclerotic disease in renal transplant recipients. In the present study, 24 kidney recipients with hyperlipidemia were treated with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin (10 mg/day). All recipients had been treated with cyclosporine (CsA), azathioprine (Az), and prednisolone (Pred). The mean total cholesterol (T-chol) level decreased from 323 +/- 7.4 to 261 +/- 7.9 mg/dl at one month after starting treatment (P less than 0.01) and this level did not change during treatment for further 6 months. The mean LDL cholesterol level was also decreased from 205.9 +/- 11.2 to 118.7 +/- 8.1 mg/dl at 3 months after starting treatment (P less than 0.01). On the other hand, pravastatin did not affect the levels of HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. Pravastatin did not show any effects on the white blood cell, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts, or the hemoglobin concentration (NS). One patient displayed a slight elevation of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, but this was not sufficient to cease treatment. Pravastatin did not adversely affect the renal function or creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. Two recipients developed nausea and vomiting and their treatment was stopped. Pravastatin appears to be a safe and efficacious method of treating hyperlipidemia in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "48": "A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, prospective, 18-week comparison of lovastatin with gemfibrozil was performed to compare their efficacy and tolerability in adults with types IIa and IIb primary hypercholesterolemia. Sixty men and 44 women aged 24 to 78 years participated in the trial. Each treatment group of 52 patients was closely matched by the randomization procedure. All participants met national cholesterol education program guidelines for evaluation and treatment. In all, 94 (90%) completed the 18 weeks of study. After 18 weeks of diet-plus-active treatment, lovastatin decreased serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol significantly better than gemfibrozil (adjusted mean decreases were 63 vs 35 mg/dl for total cholesterol and 67 vs 28 mg/dl for LDL; p = 0.0001). Gemfibrozil was more effective than lovastatin in increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (8 vs 5 mg/dl adjusted mean HDL cholesterol increases; p = 0.0086) after 18 weeks. No significant differences in the adjusted mean ratio of total to HDL cholesterol were noted, but the lovastatin group had a significantly greater adjusted mean reduction in the ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol (1.8 vs 1.3; p = 0.0013). The gemfibrozil group achieved significantly greater reductions in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and triglycerides compared with the lovastatin group (adjusted mean decreases were 14 vs 1 mg/dl for VLDL cholesterol and 71 vs 15 mg/dl for triglycerides). After 18 weeks of lovastatin therapy, 49% of patients achieved goal LDL cholesterol, whereas only 9% of those who took gemfibrozil achieved this goal (p = 0.0001).", 
    "49": "We show that both the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of NF-kappa DNA binding and kappa gene expression are blocked by treating murine pre-B lymphocyte 70Z/3 cells with 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), an inhibitor of several S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation reactions. We further show that the LPS-induced incorporation of radioactivity from [methyl-3H]methionine into methyl ester-like linkages on a group of membrane polypeptides is also inhibited by MTA treatment, suggesting the involvement of protein methylation reactions in the LPS signal transduction pathway. We also find that NF-kappa B and kappa gene activation in LPS-treated 70Z/3 cells is blocked by mevinolin, an inhibitor that prevents protein isoprenylation. Interestingly, mevinolin-treated cells also exhibited a marked reduction in the methylation of membrane proteins. Neither MTA nor mevinolin significantly inhibited NF-kappa B activation by phorbol myristate acetate, suggesting that these agents act early in signal transduction. These results provide the first evidence that carboxyl methylated and/or isoprenylated proteins play an essential role in the LPS-signaling pathway.", 
    "50": "In the present paper, the regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, acylcoenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) binding was studied in the human colon cancer carcinoma cell line Caco-2. LDL down-regulated HMG-CoA reductase activity in a dose-dependent fashion to a minimum of 28% of control at 200 micrograms/ml and LDL binding to 52% of control. The activity of ACAT was stimulated by LDL. High-density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3) increased HMG-CoA reductase activity, whereas cholesteryl ester formation was slightly decreased. Inhibition of the endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis by mevinolin increased both LDL binding and activity of HMG-CoA reductase. This effect was reversed by the addition of mevalonolactone but not by LDL. It is concluded that regulation of HMG-CoA reductase and LDL binding is subject to the availability of non-sterol products of mevalonic acid and of exogenous cholesterol. ACAT is regulated mainly by the level of its substrate cholesterol.", 
    "51": "The hypocholesterolaemic effect of pravastatin 40 mg and lovastatin 40 mg daily has been compared in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Administration of the two drugs was separated by a three-month washout period. The reduction in total serum cholesterol after 1,2 and 4 weeks of treatment was similar after pravastatin (-23%, -32% and -32%) and lovastatin (-23%, -30% and -31%). The serum concentrations of LDL cholesterol were similarly reduced, whilst triglycerides, other lipoproteins, cholestanol and squalene were not altered. The reductions in the serum levels of the cholesterol precursor sterols, delta 8-cholesterol, desmosterol and lathosterol were not significantly different after either drug. The lack of difference suggests that cholesterol synthesis was equally inhibited by the two agents. In addition, the serum content of the plant sterols campesterol and sitosterol tended to be equally increased. The comparability of the increases suggests that the absorption and biliary elimination of the two sterols were equally affected by the two statins. Thus, no difference was found between the effects of pravastatin and lovastatin on the serum levels and metabolic precursors of cholesterol in FH during four weeks of treatment.", 
    "52": "Bile acid synthesis can be measured as release of 14CO2 from [26-14C]cholesterol divided by cholesterol specific activity, but this method has not been validated in human subjects. We made twelve comparisons of this CO2 method to standard isotope dilution in six normal subjects and found a mean discrepancy of 6%. Linear regression analysis of one value with respect to the other revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.83 (P less than 0.01), a Y-intercept close to zero (-4.98) and a slope close to 1 (1.06), suggesting good correspondence between the two methods. To assess the potential for error arising from use of serum cholesterol to estimate specific activity of cholesterol used for bile acid synthesis, we compared synthesis measured using serum free cholesterol specific activity to that measured using bile cholesterol specific activity, which is known to be near isotopic equilibrium with the precursor pool used for bile acid synthesis. Synthesis calculated in these two ways differed by less than 10%. The data indicate that the CO2 method using either serum or bile cholesterol specific activity provides a valid estimate of bile acid synthesis in man.", 
    "53": "The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of simvastatin with gemfibrozil in regulating the serum lipid profiles in the local population. In this study, we reviewed the effect of medication on 75 patients with hypercholesterolaemia with or without hypertriglyceridaemia; 26 patients were on simvastatin 10 mg nightly, 24 patients were on gemfibrozil 300 mg twice daily and 25 patients were on gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily. The average follow-up period was 10.8 weeks, 19.0 weeks and 16.2 weeks for simvastatin 10 mg, gemfibrozil 300 mg and gemfibrozil 600 mg groups respectively. Prior to drug therapy, patients were put on dietary control. The pre-treatment and post-treatment serum lipid profiles were monitored. The mean changes in the lipid profiles of the patients on gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily were a 21.6% reduction in total cholesterol, a 21.8% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a 46.3% reduction in serum triglyceride and an 11.2% increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The patients in all three groups had raised HDL-C and lowered triglyceride levels post-treatment but patients on gemfibrozil had a greater increase in HDL-C and a greater decrease in triglycerides as compared to the simvastatin group. In comparison to gemfibrozil, simvastatin was more efficacious in the reduction of LDL-C. The mean reduction in the LDL-C was 21.8% for gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily group as compared to 28.0% for simvastatin 10 mg nightly group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "In a previously published multicenter study (Kannel and associates, 1990), the effects of six months' treatment with lovastatin were evaluated in patients with hypercholesterolemia. In the present report the results from the 144 elderly patients (aged 65 to 83 years) are presented and compared with those from the 343 patients aged less than 65 years. The initial dose of lovastatin was 20 mg daily and could be increased to a maximum of 80 mg/day. After one month of treatment, in both the elderly and younger patients, levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, and the total cholesterol: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and LDL:HDL [corrected] cholesterol ratios were significantly lower and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher. These improvements in the lipid profile were maintained for six months in both patient groups. LDL cholesterol goals of less than 130 mg/dl in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or two CHD risk factors and less than 160 mg/dl among the other patients were achieved by 53% of the elderly patients and 40% of the younger patients at one month (P less than 0.01) and by 62% and 47% at six months (P less than 0.01). By the end of the study, the mean daily dose of lovastatin was 35.4 mg for the elderly and 38.4 mg for the younger patients. The drug was generally well tolerated by all patients. The results indicate that both elderly and younger hypercholesterolemic patients respond well to treatment with lovastatin.", 
    "55": "We evaluated the effects of a lipid-lowering drug therapy with simvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin on the crystalline lens of the hypercholesterolemic rabbit. A threefold therapeutic dose was administered. Ocular examinations in mydriasis prior to treatment and after 14 and 30 weeks, respectively, were performed, including photographic documentation. Some degree of congenital lens opacities prior to treatment was frequently observed. No development of new cataracts could be proved during the study period.", 
    "56": "Male Wistar rats were administered with 0.1% N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethyl nitrosamine (EHEN)-containing diet for 2 weeks, and were then Rept for further 23 weeks on basal diet. At 25 weeks, the rats were divided into three groups. Group I was fed on basal diet to 40 weeks. Group II was fed on 2% cholestyramine-containing diet to 40 weeks. Group III was fed on 0.02% compactin-containing diet to 40 weeks. At 40 weeks after the start of experiment, the rats were sacrificed and examined histologically for the incidence of renal cell tumors (RCT) and dysplastic foci (DF) of the kidney. The serum levels of total cholesterol at 40 weeks were 108.9 +/- 23.4, 78.8 +/- 12.5, 95.6 +/- 43.4 mg/dl in Groups I, II and III, respectively. The levels were significantly lower in Groups II and III (p less than 0.01, 0.05, respectively, Wilcoxon test) than Group I. The average numbers of DF were 4.5 +/- 4.1, 1.3 +/- 0.3, 2.3 +/- 2.0 per cm2 of kidney slices in Groups I, II and III, respectively. DF were significantly less in Group II than Group I (p less than 0.025, Wilcoxon test), and less in Group III than Group I (not statistically significant). There was no statistical difference between Groups II and III. RCT were observed in 9 of 34 kidneys (26%), 2 of 18 (11%), 1 of 20 (5%) in Groups, I, II and III, respectively. The ratios of kidneys with RCT were lower in Group II than Group I (not statistically significant), and lower in Group III than Group I (p less than 0.05, qui-square test). There was no statistical difference between Groups II and III. RCT were classified into gross and microscopic lesions. Four gross RCT were found in 4 rats of Group I; no gross RCT was in Groups II and III. There were 5 microscopic RCT in 5 rats, 3 in 2, 1 in 1 in Groups I, II and III, respectively. In Group I, serum levels of total cholesterol were compared between the following subgroups; the rats with RCT and/or with more than 10 DF per kidney, and the rats without RCT and with less than 10 DF per kidney. The mean level was 120.8 +/- 21.8 mg/dl in the former subgroup, which was significantly higher than that (94.1 +/- 19.6 mg/dl) in the latter subgroup (p less than 0.025, Wilcoxon test). The serum cholesterol was suggested to act as a promoter in the development of DF and RCT.", 
    "57": "Simvastatin, 20 mg daily, was given orally to 21 hypercholesterolemic outpatients for 16 weeks. During treatment a significant reduction was found in plasma total and LDL cholesterol; plasma HDL-cholesterol levels increased during the treatment. Results indicate that simvastatin, because of its activity and lack of toxicity and side effects, can be considered a drug of first-choice for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "58": "Previous studies had determined the role played by L-carnitine and simvastatin in the treatment of altered lipidemia in dialyzed patients with chronic uremia. The authors carried out a study on the above substances either singly or together administered to the same patients with chronic uremia in hemodialysis. This study was aimed at demonstrating the possible synergic normolipidemic action of both substances in comparison with their single administration, because their different mechanism of action could be metabolically enhanced. The obtained results demonstrated that the therapeutic association proposed is preferable to the use of the single substances. Moreover, a higher and more rapid normolipidemic effect was obtained after using L-carnitina associated with simvastatin with respect to the separated substances.", 
    "59": "Simvastatin is a pharmacological molecule belonging to the family of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, recently included in plasma cholesterol lowering therapy. The authors carried out a study on the possible triglyceride lowering activity of simvastatin in dialyzed patients with chronic uremia considering its particular mechanism of action. The subjects selected for the study were suffering from uremia either complied with dosage prescribed or not. The obtained data showed the substance's triglyceride lowering effect, but no simvastatin-related side effect in the dialysed patients with uremia. For these reasons and for the substance's well-known cholesterol-lowering effect, simvastatin seems to deserve the definition of choice drug in the treatment of altered lipidemia in patients with uremia.", 
    "60": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase have been approved for treatment of hypercholesterolemia in humans. This class of therapeutic agents, in addition to lowering plasma cholesterol, reduces plasma triglyceride levels. We have investigated the mechanism of triglyceride-lowering effect of lovastatin in the hypertriglyceridemic state by using a rodent model of hypertriglyceridemia and obesity, the Zucker obese (fa/fa) rat. Lovastatin treatment (4 mg/kg), as compared to placebo, caused a 338% reduction in plasma triglyceride (146 +/- 5 vs. 494 +/- 76 mg/dl), a 58% decrease in total cholesterol (99 +/- 13 vs. 156 +/- 18 mg/dl), and a 67% reduction in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (69 +/- 8 vs. 115 +/- 15 mg/dl). The fall seen in plasma triglyceride was due to a decrease in hepatic secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), determined after blocking the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins with Triton WR-1339. Lovastatin treatment did not affect either the activities of hepatic lipogenic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, or malic enzyme, or the activities of the lipolytic enzymes of adipose tissue, lipoprotein lipase, or liver, hepatic triglyceride lipase. Supplementation of mevalonolactone in the diet partially reversed the changes in plasma triglyceride (265 +/- 37 vs. 146 +/- 5 mg/dl), but not in total or HDL-cholesterol. These data demonstrate that, in the hypertriglyceridemic Zucker rat model, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce the rate of secretion of VLDL and this effect can be partially reversed by administration of mevalonolactone.", 
    "61": "C100 is a baby hamster kidney cell line that expresses high levels of HMG-CoA reductase relative to its parental cell line SV28. In this study the effects of the oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonate on the mRNA level and rate of synthesis for HMG-CoA reductase were evaluated in C100 cells treated with mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. The addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol to the cell culture medium resulted in a fourfold decrease in both the rate of synthesis and mRNA level for HMG-CoA reductase. Mevalonate at a concentration of 0.4 mM, when added to mevinolin-treated C100 cells, produced no apparent reduction in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels and only a small (25%) decline in HMG-CoA synthesis. Mevalonate (0.4 mM) added to 25-hydroxycholesterol-treated cells resulted in no further reduction in the HMG-CoA reductase mRNA level when compared to cells treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol alone, but produced an additional 30-fold decrease in the rate of HMG-CoA reductase synthesis. Degradation of HMG-CoA reductase was rapid in the presence (t1/2 = 1.34 h) or absence (t1/2 = 1.17 h) of mevinolin and was not changed significantly by adding either 25-hydroxycholesterol, alone (t1/2 = 1.30 h) or both 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonate (t1/2 = 1.30 h) to mevinolin-treated cells. This study demonstrates that mevalonate and 25-hydroxycholesterol act synergistically in the presence of mevinolin to achieve a greater degree of suppression in the rate of HMG-CoA reductase synthesis than can be accounted for by their individual effects on HMG-CoA reductase mRNA. In addition, the data suggest that mevalonate affects the synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase at a yet unidentified posttranscriptional control site.", 
    "62": "The effects of simvastatin 40 mg per day for 14 weeks on the pituitary-testis axis of 19 men with familial hypercholesterolaemia have been examined in a single-blind study. Simvastatin significantly reduced serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides by 45% and 30%, respectively, and significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 15%. The alterations, which were stable 4 weeks after the start of treatment, were not associated with any significant change in sperm quality, the seminal plasma concentrations of various sex gland products (prostate-specific acid phosphatase, polyamines, citrate, fructose, alpha-glucosidase), or the serum concentrations of cortisol, testosterone, LH, FSH, or prolactin. It is concluded that a short-term reduction in circulating LDL-cholesterol has no marked effect on testicular function or sperm quality.", 
    "63": "We compared the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the HMGCoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin and probucol in the treatment of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia using an active, drug controlled, double blind, randomized, double placebo design. Patients were included if LDL-C levels after a minimum of six weeks on an AHA phase I diet were greater than 150 mg/dL and triglycerides were less than 350 mg/dL. Included patients were randomly assigned to either pravastatin 40 mg pm or probucol 500 mg bi. They also received matching placebos for each drug. The active drug period lasted 16 weeks, during which the patients were seen at 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after baseline. There were no significant differences in baseline values between both treatment groups. Significantly lower values of total cholesterol and LDL-C were observed with pravastatin as compared to probucol. While a non significant increase of HDL-C was observed with pravastatin, a remarkable and statistically significant decrease was observed with probucol. A large dispersion of triglycerides levels was observed with both drugs and no statistically significant changes were demonstrated. Both pravastatin and probucol were well tolerated: only minimal clinical and laboratory changes, not considered to have been drug-related, were observed. No changes, considered drug-related, were observed in the cristalline lens. This study shows an overall superiority of pravastatin over probucol with significant larger decreases of total cholesterol and LDL-C and a better effect on HDL-C.", 
    "64": "The effects of pravastatin on cholesterol gallstone formation were determined in prairie dogs. We fed 10 prairie dogs 1% cholesterol with or without 0.05% (w/w) pravastatin (n = 5, each) for 4 weeks. In addition, another 5 prairie dogs were fed a standard rodent chow as a control. Only the animals fed 1% cholesterol without pravastatin treatment formed cholesterol gallstones. Gallbladder bile from cholesterol-fed animals contained cholesterol monohydrate crystals, whereas those treated with pravastatin contained no crystal. Furthermore, marked increases in tissue cholesterol levels (serum, liver and bile), and in biliary mucous glycoprotein levels were evident in cholesterol-fed animals, whereas pravastatin treatment normalized these levels. These findings raise the possibility that such inhibitors might have a future role to play in the prevention of cholesterol gallstone formation and/or recurrence.", 
    "65": "Lovastatin has been used with increasing frequency over the past few years to reduce serum cholesterol. The onset of muscle weakness, one of the most serious side effects of long-term treatment with the drug, constitutes a contraindication to the continuation of therapy and commonly occurs in patients who are also receiving gemfibrozil or cyclosporine. We report the clinical and pathologic findings in a patient treated for hypercholesterolemia with lovastatin and gemfibrozil who developed a rapidly progressive necrotizing myopathy. A 57-year-old woman with hyperlipidemia, treated with lovastatin and gemfibrozil, was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of muscular weakness in her legs and neck. Neurologic examination revealed severe proximal muscle weakness involving both upper and lower extremities as well as proximal muscle tenderness and areflexia in the lower limbs. A biopsy of the quadriceps muscle showed multiple foci of mononuclear cell infiltration with myophagocytosis and slight variation in the size and shape of muscle fibers. Electron microscopy of the affected fibers showed accumulations of subsarcolemmal autophagic lysosomes. The patient's condition dramatically improved after discontinuation of lovastatin-gemfibrozil therapy.", 
    "66": "Wolman's disease is a fatal disorder characterized by absence of acid lipase and accumulation of cholesterol esters. Inanition due to malabsorption and intractable diarrhea has been the most prominent cause of early demise within the first year. Further complications have included cirrhosis and pulmonary failure due to cholesterol ester storage in respective cells. Although sustained caloric balance can be maintained by total parenteral nutrition, this has not altered the eventual course of disease. The acid lipase deficiency in leucocytes in Wolman's disease can be corrected subsequent to bone marrow transplantation. This has proven to be the case in two patients so transplanted. In two other patients, engraftment was not obtained following bone marrow transplantation. The concept of treatment of Wolman's disease by providing normalization of the acid lipase activity by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation remains valid. However, improvement of bone marrow transplant procedure needs to be implemented since pre-existing morbid pathology enhances toxicity and may prevent engraftment. Alternative modifications for accomplishing sustained engraftment without toxicity need to be examined. Other potential therapies need to be inspected in treatment of patients with Wolman's disease. The capability of reducing cellular cholesterol synthesis by use of lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, is now available. In the future, isolation and purification of acid lipase will allow for direct infusion of missing enzyme. The molecular biology now known concerning acid lipase gene holds promise for the future for recombinant manufacturing of acid lipase. And, gene therapy with its use of autologous bone marrow transplantation will be tried in future.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The first clinical studies on hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors reported a low incidence of liver toxicity. The personal observation of a case of simvastatin-induced acute cholestatic hepatitis prompted us to evaluate the true incidence of hepatic side effects of these drugs in a large Italian population. One hundred patients taking simvastatin and ninety patients treated with pravastatin were followed-up six months with periodical evaluation of serum lipid levels and liver function test. In 5% of simvastatin-treated patients and 4.5% of pravastatin-treated patients significant liver toxicity was observed, which required drug discontinuation. The mechanism of liver damage was direct, idiosyncratic, but immunological features of drug toxicity could be hypothesized in one patient.", 
    "68": "The effects of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and pravastatin on serum lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins have been studied in 35 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. LDL cholesterol was lowered to the same extent by both agents compared on a mg basis of each drug per day. HDL cholesterol was increased by lovastatin but not by pravastatin. The reduction in serum triglycerides, VLDL triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol was more pronounced after lovastatin than pravastatin. After 1 year the effect of combined treatment with 40 mg pravastatin and 8 g cholestyramine on the reduction in LDL cholesterol (-39%) in 13 patients was comparable to that of 80 mg lovastatin plus 8 g cholestyramine (-40%) in 12 patients with identical baseline values. Differences were also found in the effects of the combination therapy with the two drugs on HDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides, VLDL triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, and apolipoproteins.", 
    "69": "We conducted a retrospective review examining lipid profiles, creatine phosphokinase (CK) levels, and alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT) in patients receiving the combination of gemfibrozil and lovastatin. Serum lipid levels were significantly improved with therapy over those before therapy. Of the 70 patients receiving the combination, 5 experienced mild elevations in CK, 1 a mild elevation in ALT, and 1 mild elevations in both. No patient reported muscle weakness or muscle pain. The combination of these two medications appeared to be at least additive, highly effective, and well tolerated. The mean total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased from 278, 306, and 180 mg% to 200, 151, and 129 mg%, respectively, and the mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased from 34 to 40 mg%. This retrospective data analysis suggests that the combination of gemfibrozil and lovastatin may be safe in patients with normal renal function when the dosage of lovastatin is limited and when CK and ALT levels are monitored carefully.", 
    "70": "Lens opacity studies were performed using an electronic Lens Opacity Meter (Interzeag Opacity Lensmeter 701) in a population (n = 321) with ischaemic heart disease. These patients are participating in a trial targetting at the reduction of mortality and incidence of myocardial infarction using a cholesterol-lowering drug, simvastatin. A separate study to evaluate the reliability of the method showed good reproducibility. Repeated measurements after a short time-interval (2-10 days) gave statistically lower opacity values either due to a change in lens transparency or perhaps a change in pigment and cell dispersion in the aqueous caused by repeated mydriasis. Lens opacity values showed a highly significant positive correlation to age. Serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and smoking habits showed no significant correlations to the levels of lens opacity when adjustments for age were made.", 
    "71": "Thirty-six patients with total serum cholesterol levels above 6.5 mmol/l and Lipoprotein(a) levels above 100 mg.l-1 were evaluated in a 24 week double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study to assess the possible changes in Lp(a) during treatment with the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin. The median plasma Lp(a) increased from 359 to 464 mg.l-1 during simvastin treatment as compared to placebo (not significant). Individual changes in Lp(a) varied. In a multivariate linear regression analysis the individual change in Lp(a) was correlated with the baseline Lp(a) (r = 0.64), the change in serum triglycerides (r = 0.48) and the baseline apolipoprotein B (r = 0.36). Differences between the Lp(a) phenotypes may explain some of the varied Lp(a) responses. It appears that the effect of simvastatin on the Lp(a) level in individuals is usually insignificant, but in patients with a high Lp(a) simvastatin may further increase it.", 
    "72": "1. Oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) has been suggested to play an important role in atherogenesis by facilitating the accumulation of lipids in macrophages. In vitro studies from this laboratory have shown that oxidized LDL is recognized not only by the specific receptor for it, but also by the receptor which is common for oxidized LDL and acetyl LDL. Probucol, originally developed as an antioxidant, prevents the oxidative modification of LDL in vitro. Recent studies by the authors show that probucol prevents the progression of atherosclerosis in homozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidaemic rabbits in vivo without any changes in plasma LDL cholesterol levels. 2. These results strongly suggest that oxidative modification of LDL could occur in vivo and probucol could slow the progression of atherosclerosis, without changes in plasma cholesterol levels. 3. In addition, recently the authors demonstrated that high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles are also oxidized. Once HDL particles were oxidized, they showed a lessened effect on the decrease of cholesteryl ester in foam cells, suggesting oxidative modification of HDL may stimulate development of atherosclerosis by limiting efflux of cholesterol from foam cells. Moreover, HDL particles from probucol-treated patients are hardly oxidized; subsequently, these HDL particles caused a marked efflux of cholesterol from foam cells.", 
    "73": "The efficacy of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was investigated in 12 patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), displaying hypercholesterolemia and moderate hypertriglyceridemia. After a 4-week placebo period, simvastatin was administered in increasing doses over a period of 3 months (1st month 10 mg; 2nd month 20 mg and 3rd month 40 mg day-1). Simvastatin reduced total serum cholesterol (300.0 +/- 15.5 vs. 193.0 +/- 8.0; -35%), LDL cholesterol (203.8 +/- 13.0 vs. 104.7 +/- 6.0; -48.0%) as well as apolipoprotein B (132.3 +/- 6.6 vs. 77.8 +/- 2.7 mg/dl; -40%). Furthermore, the ratio of LDL apo B/LDL cholesterol increased significantly (0.55 +/- 0.016 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.027). Another remarkable effect was the reduction of cholesterol concentration in VLDL (47.8 +/- 5.6 vs. 30.4 +/- 5.2; -35%). Therefore, the ratio of triglycerides/cholesterol in VLDL increased (3.57 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.28 +/- 0.29), indicating VLDL formation poor in cholesterol and rich in triglycerides. However, HDL cholesterol increased significantly from 48.6 +/- 4.4 to 57.9 +/- 5.3 mg/dl (23%). Lipoprotein(a) levels were increased as compared to controls (420 +/- 73 vs. 145 +/- 26 U/l), but were not influenced significantly by simvastatin treatment (539 +/- 99 U/l, 3rd month). No evidence for notable clinical side effects and laboratory abnormalities were reported. Measurement of simvastatin plasma levels 12 h after drug administration (single dose 40 mg) showed no detectable plasma values. At present, it appears that CAPD patients with high serum cholesterol are good candidates for the treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "74": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, a new class of hypolipidaemic agents, have been recently shown to be effective in lowering both total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. In the present study 20 patients were treated with simvastatin for six months. Various dosing regimens of 10, 20, and 40 mg/day were employed. Administration of simvastatin 10 to 40 mg/day resulted in a 24.7 to 35.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels and in a 19.5 to 26.9% decrease of total cholesterol levels. Moreover, simvastatin increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and induced a decrease in plasma triglycerides. The side-effect profile was similar to other observations and included reversible transaminase elevations, myalgia and gastrointestinal complaints. From the present study simvastatin seems to be well tolerated in the short- to medium-term and to be effective; however, its long-term tolerability needs to be confirmed.", 
    "75": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are cholesterol-lowering agents which may induce rhabdomyolysis. The authors present a case of rhabdomyolysis attributed to simvastatin in a heart-transplant recipient. They stress the probability of a dose-dependent muscular toxicity and the risk of overdosage in patients already under treatment with drugs that interfere with the pharmacokinetics of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, notably ciclosporine.", 
    "76": "The effect of Lovastatin, an HMG. CoA reductase inhibitor, on serum lipids and apolipoproteins was studied in 40 cases of primary hypercholesterolemia in a 4-month period of treatment. The level of serum lipids did not change significantly after a 35-day period of placebo treatment as compared with that of the baseline (P greater than 0.5). The patients then took Lovastatin with the evening meal in a daily dose from 20 to 80 mg for 3 months. The results were as follows: Lovastatin reduced significantly the mean serum level of total cholesterol (TC) by 31.5% (P less than 0.001), LDL-C by 39.8% (P less than 0.001), Apo-B by 27.3% (P less than 0.002), and the ratio TC/HDL-C by 35.9% (P less than 0.01). It also reduced the mean serum level of triglycerides (TG) by 22.1% (P greater than 0.05) and increased that of HDL-C by 6.3% (P greater than 0.2) and Apo-AI by 1.6% (P greater than 0.5), but without much significance. The drug was well tolerated by all the patients. Transient elevation of CPK was noticed in 2 patients and AKP in one patient. 7 patients complained of gastrointestinal discomfort. All these side effects did not necessitate stop of the medication. We are, therefore, of the opinion that Lovastatin is an effective agent for lowering the serum level of TC, LDL-C and Apo-B.", 
    "77": "The Mendelian disorder known as 3-methylgutaconic aciduria (McKusick 250950) gives evidence of allelic and locus heterogeneity. Type 1 has a mild clinical phenotype and confirmed 3-methylgutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency; inheritance is autosomal recessive. Other forms have major clinical manifestations and subdivide into X-linked (type 2), a form in Iraqi Jews with optic atrophy (so-called type 3); and untyped (putative autosomal recessive) forms without identified enzyme defects. In the latter, 3-methylglutaconic aciduria may simply be a marker for another metabolic disorder. We describe a male proband with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria designated here as 'type 4' (autosomal recessive, with severe psychomotor phenotype and cerebellar dysgenesis). He is the offspring of Italian consanguineous parents. Born with congenital malformations, he has been followed for 18 years, showing profound developmental delay and cerebellar dysgenesis. Measures of hydratase activity in cultured fibroblasts from the proband and 11 additional patients (two with type 1 disease, 9 with either type 2 or an unspecified form) revealed deficient enzyme activity in type 1 cases and normal activity in the proband and the other 11 cases. Two of the untyped cases probably have 3-methylglutaconic aciduria of the type described here. Prenatal diagnosis in the form described here may be feasible by analysis of amniotic fluid metabolites in pregnancies at risk if the mother does not entirely remove elevated concentrations. A female sibling of the proband had normal metabolite values in amniotic fluid. Postnatal follow-up confirmed absence of the disease. We give the normal values for amniotic fluid and results on these additional fetuses at risk (none affected).", 
    "78": "Surgical specimens of 29 human thyroid masses, both benign and malignant, were examined by means of a novel monoclonal antibody immunoreactive to statin, which is expressed only in quiescent G0 cells. The nuclei of normal thyroid follicle tissue together with nodular goitres and follicular adenomata had similar labelling indices of 96 +/- 2.67, 95 +/- 2.43 and 94 +/- 1.98 respectively. By contrast the labelling indices of papillary and undifferentiated thyroid malignancies were 82 +/- 3.05 and 15.2, respectively. These results indicate that normal thyroid tissues as well as benign thyroid tumors have similar non-proliferative activities. The differentiated papillary cancers have a smaller non-cycling compartment, the smallest being present in the most biologically aggressive undifferentiated thyroid cancer. The immunohistological evaluation of statin in the nuclei of human thyroid malignancies correlates with their biological behaviour in an inverse relationship.", 
    "79": "Three male patients with hyperlipidaemia were given daily infusions of dextran over a period of 10 days. Plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and AI and triglycerides were analysed after the infusion of dextrans different in dose and molecular size. Dextrans caused alterations of some plasma lipids and lipoproteins exceeding the haemodilution effect. The degree of lipid lowering depends on the volume and molecular size of the administered dextran.", 
    "80": "Using a mouse model of chronic renal failure (CRF), the possibility of using lovastatin to treat hypercholesterolemia associated with CRF was examined. Renal failure was induced in 5 week-old, C57BL/6J mice by electrocoagulation of the right kidney surface followed by left nephrectomy 2 weeks later. Five weeks post-nephrectomy, BUN and serum total cholesterol levels were assessed and lovastatin treatment commenced. Upon sacrifice 4 weeks later, BUN, serum total cholesterol levels and hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity were measured. Results showed that CRF induced significant increases in serum total cholesterol levels and enzyme activity. Treatment with lovastatin led to a dose-dependent reduction in serum total cholesterol levels without affecting the enzyme activity. These results suggest that the hyper-cholesterolemia in CRF is partly due to an increase in de novo cholesterol synthesis in the liver and that the lipid-lowering effect of lovastatin is mediated by an action other than the direct reduction of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity.", 
    "81": "The effect of simvastatin on serum total and HDL cholesterol and total triglyceride levels in 20 hypercholesterolemic patients on CAPD treatment was studied. The drug was given at the initial dose of 10 mg/day which was doubled up to 40 mg/day. Two non-compliant patients stopped the drug in the first week of treatment. One patient had vomiting and stopped simvastatin. One patients reduced the dose from 20 to 10 mg/day because of increase in CPK level. The study was completed in 16 patients. Serum cholesterol decreased from 318 +/- 39 to 208 +/- 34 mg/dl (p < 0.001), triglyceride from 317 +/- 129 to 278 +/- 160 mg/dl and HDL cholesterol from 43 +/- 13 to 35 +/- 11 mg/dl. The effective does was 10 mg/day in 4 cases, 20 mg/dl in 7 and 40 mg/dl in 5. In CAPD patients, simvastatin is safe and effective in lowering serum cholesterol. The clinical significance of the decrease in HDL cholesterol and its possible effect on clinical outcome are still unknown.", 
    "82": "Coronary artery disease is frequently associated with disturbed blood lipids and with a deficient blood fibrinolytic capacity. In order to investigate a possible link between hypercholesterolemia and hypofibrinolysis, we have investigated the effect of simvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on blood lipids and fibrinolytic parameters in a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study design. Twenty-four male patients, aged between 42 and 65 years, with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease, were selected from a series of 731 consecutive patients on the basis of a fasting serum cholesterol level of more than 250 mg/dl and a plasma PAI-1 level of more than 60 ng/ml. Patients were randomly assigned to 20 mg of simvastatin daily (Group I), or placebo (Group II), for four weeks, followed by doubling of the dose for another four weeks. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. Groups I and II did not differ significantly at baseline. As expected, simvastatin produced a significant reduction in serum levels of total cholesterol (33 +/- 12 and 36 +/- 12 percent, mean +/- SD, after 4 and 8 weeks respectively, p less than 0.001 vs baseline), LDL-cholesterol (36 +/- 5 and 43 +/- 6 percent respectively, p less than 0.001 vs baseline) and apolipoprotein-B (20 +/- 29 and 23 +/- 30 percent respectively, p less than 0.05 vs baseline), whereas these parameters did not change significantly in the placebo group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "83": "Lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitor, was given to 14 patients with unremittent nephrotic syndrome (heavy proteinuria with hyperlipidaemia) for 6 months. Treatment was started at an initial dose of 20 mg/day, increasing to a maximum of 80 mg/day. Treatment was well tolerated except in two patients: one developed rhabdomyolysis and one severe hypertriglyceridaemia requiring an additional antihyperlipidaemic agent. Lovastatin was effective in reducing serum cholesterol, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B in the remaining 12 patients. Cholesterol was reduced by 31% from 8.24 +/- 0.49 mmol/l (mean +/- SEM) to 5.7 +/- 0.18 mmol/l after 6 months (P less than 0.001). LDL-C was normalized to 3.26 +/- 0.21 mmol/l from a pretreatment value of 5.76 +/- 0.48 mmol/l (P less than 0.001), a decrease of 43%. Serum apolipoprotein B was also normalized to 1.11 +/- 0.09 g/l from a basal level of 1.51 +/- 0.10 g/l (P less than 0.05). Triglyceride, HDL-C and apolipoprotein A1 concentrations were unchanged. Proteinuria as well as renal albumin clearance were unchanged. GFR by plasma radioisotope Cr-EDTA clearance for the whole group was unaltered by treatment. However, among those with relatively good pretreatment renal function (GFR greater than 70 ml/min per 1.73 m2), GFR increased at the end of 6 months' treatment (118.2 +/- 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 versus 77.6 +/- 8.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in wash-out phase).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
