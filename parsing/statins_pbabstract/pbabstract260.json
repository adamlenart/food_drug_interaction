We also examined the effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pitavastatin against the alterations of NF-kappaB, p53 and neuronal nuclei in the hippocampus after ischemia. Severe neuronal damage was observed in the hippocampal CA1 neurons 5 and 14 days after ischemia. In the present study, the increase of NF-kappaB immunoreactivity in glial cells and p53 immunoreactivity in neurons preceded neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA1 sector after ischemia. Thereafter, NF-kappaB immunoreactivity was induced highly in reactive astrocytes and microglia of the hippocampal CA1 sector where severe neuronal damage was observed. Our immunohistochemical study showed that pitavastatin prevented the alterations of NF-kappaB and p53 in the hippocampal CA1 sector 5 days after transient ischemia. Furthermore, our results with neuronal nuclei immunostaining indicate that pitavastatin dose-dependently prevented the neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1 sector 5 days after transient cerebral ischemia. These results suggest that the up-regulations of NF-kappaB in glia and p53 in neurons can cause neuronal cell death after ischemia. Our findings also support the hypothesis that NF-kappaB- and/or p53-mediated neuronal cell death is prevented through decreasing oxidative stress by pitavastatin. Thus, NF-kappaB and p53 may provide an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for brain stroke.",

Subjects were randomized to placebo, 20 mg of simvastatin, or 80 mg of simvastatin for 12 weeks. Those currently on a statin first underwent a 4-week washout. Of the 107 total patients randomized, 96 completed the trial, and 89 were able to be evaluated for efficacy. Changes in hs-CRP differed across simvastatin and placebo groups (change score +1.6 vs -0.6 mg/L, p = 0.004), but no dose response was observed when comparing 80 with 20 mg/day (-0.6 vs -0.5 mg/L, respectively). A strong dose response was observed for changes in total (p <0.01) and low-density lipoprotein (p <0.001) cholesterol. hs-CRP changes did not correlate with low-density lipoprotein changes.

Changes in TG were evident after 2 weeks of treatment and maintained thereafter. In a benchmark comparison, rosuvastatin across its dose range reduced TG by 29.1-31.1% from baseline versus 45.4% for bezafibrate. Compared with bezafibrate, rosuvastatin was superior with respect to changes in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C, -36.8 to -44.3% for rosuvastatin versus -2.0% for bezafibrate), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-31.9 to -41.0% versus +29.3%), total cholesterol (-27.1 to -33.3% versus +2.1%), although smaller improvements in HDL-C (12.4-16.7% versus 19.6%) were observed. Rosuvastatin also produced superior dose-related decreases in median high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (22.9-38.5%). Treatment was well tolerated in both rosuvastatin and bezafibrate patients, with clinically important increases in alanine aminotransferase being rare, no adverse effect on renal function being observed and no cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis being reported. The current study does not suggest a dose-related effect of rosuvastatin in lowering TG in hypertriglyceridemic Japanese patients, although dose-related improvements in other elements of the atherogenic lipid profile were observed.",

    "22": "Tissue factor (TF) is the primary physiological initiator of blood coagulation. TF has a high-affinity for factor (F) VII resulting in the formation of (TF:FVII:FVIIa) bimolecular complex which, in the presence of Ca(2+), increases the enzymatic activity of FVIIa towards its natural substrates, FIX and FX, generating their active forms FIXa and FXa, respectively. This eventually leads to thrombin generation and a fibrin clot formation. Up-regulation of TF in injured blood vessels and atherosclerotic plaque can lead to undesirable vascular thrombosis. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical synthesized from L-arginine and molecular oxygen by nitric oxide synthases (NOS). NO participates in diverse physiological and pathophysiological process as an intra or extracellular messenger. A relationship between TF and NO has been proposed. Thus, models of TF regulation by NO has been studied in different cells and experimental animal models, but the results have been conflicting. The premise that NO donors can prevent TF expression in vivo has provided the foundation for a broad field of pharmacotherapeutics in vascular medicine. A new class of drugs combining a statin (inhibitors of coenzyme A reductase) with an NO-donating moiety has been described. The resulting drug, nitrostatin, has been suggested to increase the antithrombotic effects of native statin. However, it is questionable if NO release from these drugs had any significant role on TF inhibition. In summary, care must be taken in drawing conclusions about the relationship between NO and TF. Interpretation of NO studies must take several factors into consideration, including NO bioavailability, its half-life and inactivation, as well as the cell type and experimental model used.",

The authors tested the effect of atorvastatin (10 mg/d) on 110 hyperlipidemic type 2 diabetes patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels exceeding 130 mg/d. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage change in LDL-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and secondary efficacy included the percentage change in apolipoproteins at weeks 6, 12, and 24. The tertiary goal was percentage change in free radical scavenger enzymes and oxidative stress. LDL-C was reduced by 25%, 39.3%, and 49.2%. A similar trend was observed in total cholesterol, triglyceride, non-HDL-C, and apolipoprotein (apo) B-100. HDL-C was raised by 3.2%, 6%, and 8.2%. A similar trend was seen in apo A-1.

    "32": "The rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis, the hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HCR), is phosphorylated by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). As shear stress activates the AMPK in endothelial cells, we determined whether it affects HCR activity and subsequent HCR-dependent signaling. Shear stress (12 dynes cm(-2)) rapidly increased the phosphorylation and activity (6.5- and 4-fold, respectively) of the AMPK in cultured endothelial cells and the activated AMPK phosphorylated the HCR in vitro. Moreover, shear stress and the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) attenuated endothelial HCR activity by 37% and 33%, respectively. Inhibition of NO production attenuated the acute shear stress-induced phosphorylation of the AMPK and the decrease in HCR activity. Prolonged shear stress (18 hours) led to a significant (50%) decrease in HCR mRNA expression that was dependent on NO, AMPK, and the subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of FoxO1a. Correspondingly, the downregulation of FoxO (small interfering RNA) decreased HCR expression. Prolonged shear stress also attenuated the bradykinin-induced activation of Ras and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, a phenomenon that was comparable to the effects of cerivastatin and that was reversed by mevalonate and thus attributed to HCR inhibition. A decrease (35%) in HCR expression was also detected in femoral arteries from mice following voluntary exercise, and the bradykinin-induced vasodilatation of the mouse hindlimb was attenuated by both exercise and the HCR inhibitor cerivastatin. These data indicate that fluid shear stress regulates the activity and expression of the HCR in endothelial cells and determines responsiveness to stimuli, such as bradykinin via a mechanism involving NO, AMPK, FoxO1a, and p21Ras.",

To explore the effects of atorvastatin on inflammatory progression and major cardiac electrophysiological changes in myocarditis, we used an animal model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM). In this model, BALB/c mice were treated with atorvastatin and we evaluated the levels of inflammation markers and currents of ionic channels that contribute to the duration of action potential (APD) of ventricular myocytes. We demonstrated that atorvastatin treatment attenuated inflammatory infiltration and suppressed the increase in TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels in EAM mouse hearts. In the whole-cell patch-clamp experiment, ventricular cardiomyocyte APD was prolonged in EAM group, and atorvastatin blocked this change. We further found that atorvastatin attenuated the significant decrease in outward potassium currents in EAM myocytes. Our results suggested that atorvastatin may ameliorate EAM progression by reducing inflammatory cytokine level. Atorvastatin exerted the antiarrhythmic effects by selectively affecting cardiomyocyte ion channel activity and therefore improves myocardial repolarization.", 
    "35": "Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a major cause of the failure of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment surgery. The pathogenesis of PVR includes a fibrotic reaction of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells caused by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta. The cellular mechanisms by which TGF-beta induces extracellular matrix protein synthesis are not fully understood. In this study, we examined whether the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway was involved in TGF-beta2-induced collagen expression in a human RPE cell line, ARPE-19. The roles of RhoA and Rho-kinase were evaluated using biochemical inhibitors, RhoA inhibitor, simvastatin and Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y27632. The effects of simvastatin or Y27632 on the type I collagen mRNA (COL1A1 and COL1A2) expression induced by TGF-beta2 were evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. The effects of simvastatin or Y27632 on type I collagen synthesis induced by TGF-beta2 were assessed by immunocytochemical analysis with anti-type I collagen antibody. To examine the effects of simvastatin or Y27632 on COL1A2 promoter activity induced by TGF-beta2, luciferase reporter assays were also performed. Moreover, the role of RhoA itself on COL1A2 promoter activity was assessed using the constructs of constitutively active RhoA and dominant-negative RhoA. RhoA was activated within 5 min after stimulation with TGF-beta2, and its activation persisted for as long as 1 h in a dose-dependent fashion. Preincubation of ARPE-19 with simvastatin (5 microM) or Y27632 (10 microM) significantly prevented TGF-beta2-induced COL1A1 and COL1A2 gene expression. Inhibition of RhoA/Rho-kinase markedly suppressed TGF-beta2-induced type I collagen synthesis in ARPE-19. Moreover, the blockage of RhoA/Rho-kinase inhibited the increase in COL1A2 promoter activity when induced by TGF-beta2. Constitutively active RhoA increased COL1A2 promoter activity in the presence or absence of TGF-beta2. Simvastatin and Y27632 reduced active RhoA-induced COL1A2 promoter activity. The dominant-negative RhoA inhibited COL1A2 promoter activity augmentation induced by TGF-beta2. In the luciferase assay using a mutation construct of the Smad binding site in COL1A2 promoter (Smad-mut/Luc), the treatment with simvastatin and Y27632 significantly reduced TGF-beta2 induction of Smad-mut/Luc promoter activity. On the other hand, both simvastatin and Y27632 significantly reduced CAGA12-Luc activity induced by TGF-beta2. These results indicate that the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway plays a role in relaying TGF-beta2 signal transduction to type I collagen synthesis in RPE cells in a Smad-dependent and Smad-independent fashion. The RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway may be a therapeutic target for treating PVR.", 
    "36": "We have previously reported neuroprotection in spinal cord injury (SCI) by Lipitor [atorvastatin (AT)]-pre-treatment. Though informative, pre-treatment studies find only limited clinical application as trauma occurrence is unpredictable. Therefore, this study investigates the efficacy of AT treatment post-SCI. In a rat model of contusion-SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis, AT treatment (5 mg/kg; gavage) was begun 2, 4, or 6 h post-SCI followed by a once daily dose thereafter for 6 weeks. While the placebo vehicle (VHC)-SCI rats showed substantial functional deficit, AT-SCI animals exhibited significant functional recovery. AT diminished injury-induced blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) dysfunction with significantly reduced infiltration and tumor necrosis factor-alpha/interleukin-1beta/inducible nitric oxide synthase expression at site of injury. BSCB protection in AT-SCI was attributable to attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression - a central player in BSCB disruption. Furthermore, endothelial MMP9 expression was found to be RhoA/ROCK pathway-mediated and regulated by AT through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Attenuation of these early inflammatory events reduced secondary damage. Significant reduction in axonal degeneration, myelin degradation, gliosis, and neuronal apoptosis with resultant enhancement in tissue sparing was observed in AT-SCI compared with VHC-SCI. In summary, this novel report presenting the efficacy of post-injury AT treatment might be of critical therapeutic value as effective treatments are currently unavailable for SCI.", 
    "37": "In view of the cardioprotective effect of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and the limited effects of statin and fibrate therapy on HDL cholesterol, it is clinically relevant to test whether pharmacological treatment aimed at raising HDL lowers cardiovascular risk. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a new therapeutic target, because the cholesteryl ester transfer process lowers HDL cholesterol and contributes to an atherogenic lipoprotein profile, particularly when plasma triglycerides are high. Clinical evidence suggests that coronary artery calcification as well as intima media thickness is positively related to plasma cholesteryl ester transfer, and that high plasma CETP concentration is associated with increased cardiovascular risk in hypertriglyceridaemia. However, CETP could also have anti-atherogenic potential, since it provides a potentially beneficial route for delivery of HDL-derived cholesteryl esters to the liver. In addition, CETP could also favourably stimulate peripheral cell cholesterol removal and enhance hepatic cholesterol uptake. Recent evidence suggests that a high CETP level may confer lower cardiovascular risk in the context of low triglycerides. At maximal doses, the CETP inhibitors JTT-705 and torcetrapib elicit a marked rise in HDL cholesterol of up to 34% and 91-106%, respectively. The effectiveness of these drugs on (intermediate) clinical outcome measures is currently being tested in large-scale phase III clinical trials, with torcetrapib being only evaluated in combination therapy with atorvastatin. When and how to use CETP inhibitors, e.g. in combination with a statin or a fibrate, is a major challenge. We propose that low HDL cholesterol in the context of high triglycerides, such as found in type 2 diabetes mellitus, could become an important indication area for this new class of drugs.",

The authors describe the in-hospital and discharge prescription patterns of lipid-lowering agents in patients hospitalized with an AMI, and identify factors associated with low rates of utilization of these therapies. The authors analyzed the Minnesota Heart Survey, a population-based surveillance project that retrospectively abstracted the medical records of patients hospitalized with AMI in 2001-2002 from 21 hospitals in the Minneapolis-St Paul metropolitan area. They identified 2773 patients 30 years and older with an AMI. The mean total cholesterol was 175+/-45 mg/dL, the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 104+/-38 mg/dL, and the mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 44+/-14 mg/dL. Statins were prescribed at discharge to 74.6%, 63.2%, and 38.5% of patients younger than 65, 65-74, and 75 years and older, respectively (P<.0001). The utilization of statins was highly correlated with the administration of other standard AMI therapies-aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and reperfusion therapy-and was more prevalent among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention than among those undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Elderly patients remain less likely to receive lipid-lowering therapy following an AMI. Greater attention is required to ensure that elderly AMI patients without contraindications are appropriately treated with lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "39": "A recent update to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines suggests low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals of <70 mg/dL in very-high-risk patients and <100 mg/dL in high-risk patients. Currently available 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are not equal in their ability to lower LDL-C, and it is unlikely that the substantial LDL-C reductions that are often needed in high-risk persons can be achieved with starting doses of some of the older statins. Possible alternatives in such cases include the use of high-dose statin therapy, a more efficacious statin, or combination therapy. Recent clinical data have demonstrated a greater likelihood of coronary heart disease event reduction with aggressive statin therapy that lowers LDL-C in a robust fashion (>30%-40%) than with moderate therapy. Until data from ongoing trials of combination therapy are available, however, monotherapy with a potent statin should be initiated to lower LDL-C. Nonetheless, for residual elevation in triglycerides and/or reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, adding a second agent (eg, fenofibrate, niacin) is a reasonable option.", 
    "40": "The phenomenon of slow progression of angiographic contrast in the coronary arteries in the absence of stenosis in the epicardial vessels in some patients presenting with chest pain has been recently called as slow coronary flow syndrome because the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms as well as therapeutics of this unique phenomenon is less well understood. Although this phenomenon was first reported on in 1972 by Tambe, few studies have focused on the etiology of this unique angiographic finding since that time. Several hypotheses have been poised to elucidate this phenomenon, including a form of early phase of atherosclerosis, small vessel dysfunction, Hagen-Poiseuille's equation model, imbalance between vasoconstrictor and vasodilatory factors, and platelet function disorder. During the last several years there has been arisen the most interesting concept of \"atherosclerosis as a inflammation disease\", which is involving the different entities of coronary artery disease covering slow coronary flow syndrome. The angiographic finding appeared as slow flow is an important clinical entity because it may be the cause of angina at rest or during exercise, acute myocardial infarction, and hypertension. Despite the good prognosis, patients complained commonly of persistent uncomfortable chest, which can significantly impair quality of life. There is no effective therapy for patients with slow coronary flow syndrome up to now. Statins have been showed the important benefits for the large populations of individuals at high risk of coronary artery disease. In addition to lowering lipid profile, statins have pleiotropic effects on improving vascular function. Increasing evidence, suggests that reduction of cardiovascular events conferred by statins relates not only to cholesterol lowering but also to direct effects on endothelium function as well as anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory actions. Accordingly, we hypotheses that these pleiotropic effects of statin may be beneficial for patients with slow coronary flow syndrome due to its pharmacological basis.",

Atorvastatin reduces concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with which PAF-AH is associated, and PLA(2)s' protein concentrations. We investigated the effect of atorvastatin on PLA(2)s and PAF-AH activity and the urinary excretion of 15-F(2trans)-isoprostane (15-F(2t)-IsoP, 8-iso-PGF(2alpha), iPF(2alpha)-III).",

Our data also showed that the increased secretion of cytokines was a result of increased mRNA expression. Furthermore, the effects of statin and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor agonists on high glucose-enhanced secretion of cytokines were determined. The results showed that simvastatin, but not fenofibrate or pioglitazone, inhibited high glucose-enhanced cytokine release.",

    "53": "The metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular dysmetabolic syndrome is characterized by obesity, central obesity, insulin resistance, atherogenic dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The major risk factors leading to this syndrome are physical inactivity and an atherogenic diet and cornerstone clinical feature is abdominal obesity or adiposity. In addition, patients usually have elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, elevated LDL cholesterol, other abnormal lipid parameters, hypertension, and elevated fasting blood glucose. Impaired fibrinolysis, increased susceptibility to thrombotic events, and raised inflammatory markers are also observed. Given that India has the largest number of subjects with type-2 diabetes in the world it can be extrapolated that this country also has the largest number of patients with the metabolic syndrome. Epidemiological studies confirm a high prevalence. Therapeutic approach involves intervention at a macro-level and control of multiple risk factors using therapeutic lifestyle approaches (diet control and increased physical activity, pharmacotherapy - anti-obesity agents) for control of obesity and visceral obesity, and targeted approach for control of individual risk factors. Pharmacological therapy is a critical step in the management of patients with metabolic syndrome when lifestyle modifications fail to achieve the therapeutic goals. Anti-obesity drugs such as sibutramine and orlistat can be tried to reduce weight and central obesity and jointly control the metabolic syndrome components. Other than weight loss, there is no single best therapy and treatment should consist of treatment of individual components of the metabolic syndrome. Newer drugs such as the endocannabinoid receptor blocker,rimonabant, appear promising in this regard. Atherogenic dyslipidemia should be controlled initially with statins if there is an increase in LDL cholesterol. If there are other lipid abnormalities then combination therapy of statin with fibrates, nicotinic acid, or ezetimibe should be considered. For insulin resistance, drugs such as thiazolidinediones and renin-angiotensin system blockers are available. Available evidence suggests that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBS) may be more beneficial for treatment of hypertension in patients with metabolic syndrome compared to others as these drugs also prevent development of diabetes. Patients with metabolic syndrome also have elevations in fibrinogen and other coagulation factors leading to prothrombotic state and aspirin may be beneficial for primary prevention in these patients. The new developments in the treatment of metabolic syndrome with drugs, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists and cannabinoid receptor-1 antagonists, will broaden the horizons of the current treatment options. Fixed-dose combination polypharmacy using a single pill is an interesting concept that needs to be evaluated in long-term prospective trials in such patients.",

    "58": "Proteinuria predicts the decline of renal function in chronic kidney disease. Reducing albuminuria has been shown to be associated with a reduction in this rate of decline. Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), when exposed to albumin produce matrix proteins, proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines like TGF-beta(1). Some of these effects are dependent on endocytosis of albumin by PTECs. However, conditions like diabetic nephropathy, believed to be associated with reduced albumin endocytosis, are associated with interstitial fibrosis. Moreover, megalin, the putative albumin binding receptor in PTECs, has potential signaling motifs in its cytoplasmic domain, suggesting its ability to signal in response to ligand binding from the apical surface of PTECs. Hence, we looked to see whether albumin-induced secretion of TGF-beta(1) by PTECs is dependent on albumin endocytosis or whether it could occur in the absence of albumin endocytosis. We studied the production of TGF-beta(1) in two accepted models of PTECs, opossum kidney cells and human kidney cell clone-8 cells, with widely varying degrees of endocytosis. We then studied the effect of inhibiting albumin endocytosis with various inhibitors on albumin-induced TGF-beta(1) secretion. Our results indicate that albumin-induced TGF-beta(1) secretion by PTECs does not require albumin endocytosis and therefore the mechanism for the induction of some profibrotic responses by albumin may differ from those required for some of the inflammatory responses. Moreover, we found that albumin-induced TGF-beta(1) secretion by PTECs is not dependent on its interaction with megalin.",

According to available evidence, statin therapy may reduce cardiovascular risk in chronic kidney disease as well as modify its course, especially in patients with moderate impairment of renal function. However, all these findings must be examined in large-scale trials in patients with chronic renal disease and different stages of renal insufficiency.

The 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, can protect the vasculature in a manner that is independent of its lipid-lowering activity. We examined the effect of pravastatin on TM expression by human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) with subsequent tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) stimulation and investigated the signaling pathways involved. TNFalpha treatment attenuated TM expression in HAECs in a time-dependent manner. Pravastatin upregulated TM levels in TNFalpha-treated HAECs. Specific inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferase-I or the Rho family by GGTI-286 or TcdB, respectively, enhanced TM expression in TNFalpha-treated HAECs, whereas MAP kinase inhibitors, inactivation of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme, or the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, had no effect. In TNFalpha-treated HAECs, pravastatin inhibited Rac1 and Cdc42 activation and their translocation to the cell membrane. Blocking the transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB prevented the TNFalpha-induced downregulation of TM. The pravastatin-induced increase in TM expression in TNFalpha-treated HAECs was mediated through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Pravastatin regulates TM expression by inhibiting the activation of the Rho family proteins, Rac1 and Cdc42, and the transcription factor, NF-kappaB. The increase in endothelial TM activity in response to pravastatin constitutes a novel pleiotropic (nonlipid-related) effect of this commonly used compound and may be of clinical significance in disorders in which deficient endothelial TM plays a pathophysiological role.",

Although the exact mechanisms by which statins may reduce postoperative atrial fibrillation are unclear, accumulating evidence suggests that statins exert multiple effects independent of their effect on LDL cholesterol.

Although the effects of increased plasma cholesterol have been previously reported, it is not obvious how very low plasma cholesterol levels would affect membrane composition and the deformability of red blood cells (RBC). The present study investigated the effects of hypocholesterolemia achieved by atorvastatin therapy on RBC membrane and mechanical properties in guinea pigs fed a normal diet. Two groups of animals were used (atorvastatin-treated, n=12; control n=12), and atorvastatin given orally in isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day for a 21-day period. Our results indicate that the atorvastatin-treated group had significantly lower plasma total cholesterol (17.42+/-1.70 mg/dl), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (5.25+/-2.22 mg/dl) and triglycerides (42.60+/-3.78 mg/dl) than the control group (34.08+/-1.72, 21.17+/-1.41 and 60.64+/-2.43 mg/dl, respectively). In addition, membrane cholesterol content was lower (p<0.0001) and phospholipid content higher (p<0.0001) in the atorvastatin-treated group, thus decreasing the cholesterol to phospholipid ratio; a significant enhancement in sodium-potassium-ATPase activity also occurred.

    "82": "Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative indicated for use in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia, mixed dyslipidaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia in adults who have not responded to nonpharmacological measures. Its lipid-modifying effects are mediated by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha. Fenofibrate also has nonlipid (i.e. pleiotropic) effects (e.g. it reduces fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and uric acid levels and improves flow-mediated dilatation). Fenofibrate improves lipid levels (in particular triglyceride [TG] and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL-C] levels) in patients with primary dyslipidaemia. Its lipid-lowering profile means that fenofibrate is particularly well suited for use in atherogenic dyslipidaemia (characterised by high TG levels, low HDL-C levels and small, dense low-density lipoprotein [LDL] particles), which is commonly seen in patients with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Indeed, fenofibrate improves the components of atherogenic dyslipidaemia in patients with these conditions, including a shift from small, dense LDL particles to larger, more buoyant LDL particles. Greater improvements in lipid levels are seen when fenofibrate is administered in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) or in combination with ezetimibe, compared with monotherapy with these agents. In the DAIS study, fenofibrate significantly slowed the angiographic progression of focal coronary atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. In terms of clinical outcomes, although no significant reduction in the risk of coronary events was seen with fenofibrate in the FIELD trial in patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment was associated with a significantly reduced risk of total cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, primarily through the prevention of non-fatal myocardial infarction and coronary revascularisation. Subgroup analyses revealed significant reductions in total CVD events and coronary heart disease events in patients with no previous CVD, suggesting a potential role for primary prevention with fenofibrate in patients with early type 2 diabetes. Improvements were also seen in microvascular outcomes with fenofibrate in the FIELD trial. Fenofibrate is generally well tolerated, both as monotherapy and when administered in combination with a statin. Combination therapy with fenofibrate plus a statin appears to be associated with a low risk of rhabdomyolysis; no cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in patients receiving such therapy in the FIELD trial. Thus, fenofibrate is a valuable lipid-lowering agent, particularly in patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia.", 
    "83": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality with a high level of safety. Nonetheless, there are substantial numbers of people who either do not tolerate statins or whose low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels are not lowered adequately. For these reasons, there is a need to develop other cholesterol-lowering drugs. A target for these new agents is provided by the enzymes distal to HMG-CoA reductase in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Two classes of drugs have been developed: (i) squalene synthase inhibitors, which act at the first committed step in cholesterol biosynthesis, distal to the mevalonate-farnesyl diphosphate pathway; and (ii) oxidosqualene cyclase inhibitors, which act distal to the squalene intermediate. Of these, squalene synthase inhibitors have received more attention and are the subject of this review. Squalene synthase inhibitors decrease circulating LDL-cholesterol by the induction of hepatic LDL receptors in a similar manner to statins. They have fewer secondary effects mediated by a decrease in non-cholesterol products of mevalonate metabolism distal to HMG-CoA reductase, but have the potential to increase intermediates proximal to squalene. Squalene synthase inhibitors are just now entering clinical trials and data on how effectively they lower LDL-cholesterol and how they compliment the actions of statins and other agents is awaited with considerable interest.",

Statins may also be potent immunomodulatory agents and may be beneficial in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study, we investigated therapeutic effects of atorvastatin and lovastatin on experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU). EAU was induced in Lewis rats using bovine S-antigen (S-Ag) peptide. Atorvastatin was suspended in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose and was administered orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg and at a low-dose of 1 mg/kg. Lovastatin was dissolved in DMSO:PBS (1:1) and was administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection at a dose of 2 mg/kg. Both statin treatments were initiated after the clinical onset once daily for 14 days. The rats were examined every other day for clinical signs of EAU. The histological scores and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) were evaluated on day 28 post-immunization. Morphologic and immunohistochemical examinations were performed with light and confocal microscopy, respectively. Lymphocyte proliferation was measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into antigen-stimulated T cells from inguinal lymph nodes. After 72 h, supernatants were collected and assayed for IFN-gamma by ELISA. Clinical and histological scores of EAU were decreased in both the atorvastatin (10 mg/kg)- and lovastatin (2 mg/kg)-treated groups. The invasion of T cells and macrophages, and M\u00fcller cell proliferation, were inhibited in both atorvastatin- and lovastatin-treated groups. DTH was significantly inhibited in both groups, compared with vehicle-treated groups (controls). Lymphocyte proliferation assay demonstrated decreased proliferation in the presence of 25 microg/ml S-Ag peptide in both groups, compared with controls. In the supernatants of lymph node cells stimulated with S-Ag peptide (5 microg/ml), 77 or 87% inhibition of IFN-gamma production was observed in rats treated with atorvastatin or lovastatin, respectively, compared with controls. The current results indicate that atorvastatin administrated orally following the clinical onset has therapeutic effect in EAU as well as lovastatin administrated intraperitoneally. Statins may be useful for treating intraocular inflammation.",

In many classes of organisms, this is the committed step leading to the synthesis of essential compounds, such as cholesterol. However, a high level of cholesterol is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease, for which an effective clinical treatment is to block HMGR using inhibitors like statins. Recently the structures of catalytic portion of human HMGR complexed with six different statins have been determined by a delicate crystallography study (Istvan and Deisenhofer Science 2001, 292, 1160-1164), which established a solid basis of structure and mechanism for the rational design, optimization, and development of even better HMGR inhibitors. In this study, three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D QSAR) with comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was performed on a training set of up to 35 statins and statin-like compounds. Predictive models were established by using two different ways: (1) Models-fit, obtained by SYBYL conventional fit-atom molecular alignment rule, has cross-validated coefficients (q2) up to 0.652 and regression coefficients (r2) up to 0.977. (2) Models-dock, obtained by FlexE by docking compounds into the HMGR active site, has cross-validated coefficients (q2) up to 0.731 and regression coefficients (r2) up to 0.947. These models were further validated by an external testing set of 12 statins and statin-like compounds. Integrated with CoMFA 3D QSAR predictive models, molecular surface property (electrostatic and steric) mapping and structure-based (both ligand and receptor) virtual screening have been employed to explore potential novel hits for the HMGR inhibitors. A representative set of eight new compounds of non-statin-like structures but with high pIC(50) values were sorted out in the present study.",

Measurement of the progression of atherosclerosis through carotid intima-media thickness, coronary mean lumen diameter, and, mostly recently, intravascular ultrasound is generally accepted. This article reviews the role of lipid-lowering therapies in changing the rate of atherosclerosis progression in the coronary and carotid circulations. Statins are the primary therapy used to reduce atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events, including strokes and transient ischemic attacks, and have benefits in reducing events in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy. In contrast, data for other agents, including fibrates and nicotinic acid, in reducing the progression of atherosclerosis are less extensive and not as well known. There is increasing interest in optimizing the whole lipid profile, as this might deliver extra benefits over and above statin therapy alone. Initial proof of this concept has recently come from studies that measured the progression of atherosclerosis and showed that adding nicotinic acid to statin therapy and, more directly, infusion of high-density lipoprotein-like particles reduced progression and indeed might induce regression of the disease. It is likely that the management of significant carotid stenosis will become ever more drug focused and will be customized to the lipid profile of each patient with intervention reserved only for late-stage symptomatic disease.",

The effects of fluvastatin as an antioxidant on colorectal carcinogenesis in mice with UC were investigated. Treatment with fluvastatin in mice with UC abolished the anemia caused by colorectal carcinogenesis, and markedly lowered plasma lipid levels resulting in a reduction of colitis and carcinogenesis, shown by inhibition of the decrease in colorectal length, the increased number of foci of gland loss with inflammatory cell infiltration indicating the severity of UC and incidence of colorectal dysplasia, respectively, with a reduction in anti-8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) antibody (a biological marker of in vivo oxidative DNA damage)-positive cells of the colorectal mucosa and the activity of the DNA-synthesizing enzyme thymidine kinase in colorectal tissues.",

The adopted indicators for drug utilization included the Defined Daily Dose (DDD), the Received Daily Dose (RDD), and a surrogated Prescribed Daily Dose (sPDD), extrapolated from available prescription data. An Adherence to Therapy Index (ATI) was calculated from the ratio between the amount of drug actually prescribed and the amount of sPDD.

LDL receptor-deficient mice were immunized with human beta2GP1, human serum albumin (HSA), or not immunized, and fed a high-cholesterol diet for 14 weeks. Some mice also received pravastatin. Immunization with human beta2GP1 or HSA resulted in formation of autoantibodies recognizing murine beta2GP1 or murine albumin, respectively. We quantified atherosclerotic lesion development and mRNA levels of inflammation associated proteins in the thoraco-abdominal aorta as well as lesion development,cellular composition and collagen content in the aortic roots. Immunization with beta2GP1 or HSA had no effect on lesion size,but modified the expression in plaque areas of several inflammation-associated proteins. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9, tissue factor, interferon-gamma and CD25 was highest in the thoraco-abdominal aorta of beta2GP1-immunized mice, lowest in non-immunized mice and intermediate in HSA-immunized animals. Immunization with beta2GP1, but not HSA, resulted in a lower smooth muscle cell and collagen content of lesions in aortic roots. Statin treatment partially reversed the effects of beta2GP1 immunization. We conclude that immunization with beta2GP1, and to a lesser extent with HSA, leads to modifications in the cellular and protein composition of atherosclerotic plaques, which are associated with a more inflammatory phenotype. Statin treatment partially prevents these changes.", 
    "140": "Statins, the most widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs, are considered to be first-line therapeutics for the prevention of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. Statins act by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis, which catalyzes the reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. Inhibition of this enzyme has proven to be effective for lowering plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in humans and can therefore be useful to treat atherosclerotic and dyslipidemic disorders. However, the clinical benefits of statins appear to extend beyond their lipid-lowering effects. Besides reducing cholesterol biosynthesis, inhibition of mevalonate by statins also leads to a reduction in the synthesis of important intermediates, such as the isoprenoids farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. These intermediates are involved in the posttranslational prenylation of several proteins (e.g., Ras, Rho, Rac) that modulate a variety of cellular processes including cellular signaling, differentiation, and proliferation. Given the central role of these isoprenylated proteins in endothelial function, atherosclerotic plaque stability, platelet activity, coagulation, oxidation, and inflammatory and immunologic responses, it could be anticipated that these compounds may exert multiple beneficial effects in a broad spectrum of disorders including cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease and related vascular dementia, viral and bacterial infection, etc. This article summarizes these cholesterol-lowering-independent effects of statins, termed \"pleiotropic effects\", and the underlying mechanisms, as well as the preclinical experimental approaches that would be useful to evaluate the effects of statins.", 
    "141": "Macrophage accumulation participates decisively in the development and exacerbation of atherosclerosis. Circulating monocytes, the precursors of macrophages, display heterogeneity in mice and humans, but their relative contribution to atherogenesis remains unknown. We report here that the Ly-6C(hi) monocyte subset increased dramatically in hypercholesterolemic apoE-deficient mice consuming a high-fat diet, with the number of Ly-6C(hi) cells doubling in the blood every month. Ly-6C(hi) monocytes adhered to activated endothelium, infiltrated lesions, and became lesional macrophages. Hypercholesterolemia-associated monocytosis (HAM) developed from increased survival, continued cell proliferation, and impaired Ly-6C(hi) to Ly-6C(lo) conversion and subsided upon statin-induced cholesterol reduction. Conversely, the number of Ly-6C(lo) cells remained unaffected. Thus, we believe that Ly-6C(hi) monocytes represent a newly recognized component of the inflammatory response in experimental atherosclerosis.",

Cyclosporine is also a moderate inhibitor of this isoenzyme. We postulate that competition between atorvastatin and clopidogrel for CYP3A4 receptors, already partially inhibited by cyclosporine, led to increased atorvastatin concentrations, resulting in the acute onset of rhabdomyolysis. This theory is further supported by the patient's continued ability to tolerate the combination of atorvastatin and cyclosporine, without clopidogrel, on rechallenge. Use of the Naranjo probability scale revealed that rhabdomyolysis was probably precipitated by the addition of clopidogrel to the stable baseline regimen of cyclosporine and atorvastatin.",

Seven months after starting lovastatin, the patient experienced testicular discomfort that resolved upon discontinuation of the drug. Afterward, he started simvastatin and again experienced testicular discomfort. The simvastatin was changed to atorvastatin, and the pain resolved. However, 3 months after starting atorvastatin, the patient developed testicular pain, which resolved after the drug was stopped. During each of the episodes, the patient's pain increased when he was sitting, driving, or wearing tight clothing. The Naranjo probability scale indicates that statins probably caused the patient's pain.", 
    "148": "Testicular pain is rarely caused by medications. Product labeling for statins does not list urinary adverse events as common. However, labeling for atorvastatin and pravastatin lists rare urologic adverse effects. A literature search did not reveal any previously reported cases of testicular adverse effects from statins. However, statins have been shown to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the testis. Some data indicate that statins reduce serum testosterone concentrations, but other data indicate that statins have no effect on sex hormones or spermatogenesis. Data are also available indicating that aspirin might affect testosterone concentrations and testicular function. It is difficult to know whether either of the above hormonal mechanisms was associated with our patient's testicular discomfort, but the time course and challenge/rechallenge aspects of the case suggest that the statins were the cause.",

    "152": "Seven English-language studies evaluating morning and evening statin administration were identified and evaluated. Based on the available data, simvastatin demonstrated a pronounced LDL-C percentage reduction with evening dosing. Although not statistically significant, a trend in the LDL-C percentage reduction favoring evening statin administration was noted with lovastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin. Atorvastatin demonstrated similar LDL-C reduction regardless of administration time. With the exception of simvastatin, the trials comparing morning versus evening effects of statins on LDL-C have several significant methodologic shortcomings, including small sample size, lack of statistical power, and inappropriate exclusion criteria that did not include or did not mention drug-induced effects on lipids.",

    "158": "Actin filaments play a critical role in the normal physiology of lenticular and retinal cells in the eye. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton has been associated with retinal pathology and lens cataract formation. Ocular toxicity is an infrequent observation in drug safety studies, yet its impact to the drug development process is significant. Recognizing compounds through screening with a potential ocular safety liability is one way to prioritize development candidates while reducing development attrition. Lens epithelial cells from human, dog, and rat origins and retinal pigmented epithelium cells from human, monkey, and rat origins were cultured and investigated with immunocytochemical techniques. Cells were treated using noncytotoxic doses of the compound, fixed, stained for actin with rhodamine phalloidin, and counterstained for nuclei with TOTO-3, followed by confocal imaging. Tamoxifen and several experimental compounds known to be in vivo lens and retinal toxicants caused a reduction in F-actin fluorescence at noncytotoxic concentrations in all cells tested as observed by confocal microscopy. Developing an assay that predicts ocular toxicity helps the development process by prioritizing compounds for further investigation. Drug-induced cytoskeletal alterations may be useful as a potential safety-screening marker of retinal and lens toxicity. The knowledge of actin molecular biology and the application of other mechanistic screens to toxicology are discussed. Reducing this work to a high-throughput platform will enable chemists to select compounds with a reduced risk of ocular toxicity.", 
    "159": "In the general population, the relation between lipids and cardiovascular disease is clearcut, whereas it is highly controversial in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This is primarily due to diverging results of retrospective observational trials. This study design often encounters confounding, especially in renal disease patients. Even if analyses are corrected for multiple influences, there might be unknown confounders changing the results. Prospective randomized trials assure that groups are comparable except for the intervention used. Confounding is eliminated by randomization. Nevertheless, the lipid discussion was restarted when two randomized, placebo-controlled, interventional trials on lipid-lowering therapy in renal patients have been published (Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplantation and 4D Study [Atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes on hemodialysis]). Surprisingly, both showed no significant reduction of the primary endpoint by statin therapy. In addition to other factors, this might be due to an altered pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in renal patients where multiple nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors are to be mentioned and different characteristics of cardiovascular disease with a high proportion of sudden cardiac death are present. This review will focus on dyslipidemia in renal failure and its treatment. The data published so far is summarized and grouped according to the different stages of CKD.", 
    "160": "Human Immune Deficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) infection can induce severe and debilitating neurological problems, including behavioral abnormalities, motor dysfunction, and dementia. HIV can persistently infect astrocytes, during which viral accessory proteins are produced that are unaffected by current antiretroviral therapy. The effect of these proteins on astrocyte function remains unknown. Astrocytes are the predominant cells within the brain; thus, disruption of astrocyte function could influence the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. To explore further these effects, we constitutively expressed HIV-Tat protein in astrocytes. Since the nuclear presence of Tat protein leads to alteration of host gene expression, we further analyzed the effects of Tat on host gene transcripts. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) was a significantly elevated transcript as verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and it was subsequently released extracellularly in Tat-expressing and HIV-infected astrocytes. ET-1 expression was also prominent in reactive astrocytes and neurons in brain tissues from basal ganglia and frontal lobes of HIV encephalitic patients. HIV-Tat regulated ET-1 at the transcriptional level through NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-responsive sites in the ET-1 promoter. Intriguingly, simvastatin (10 microM) down-regulated HIV-Tat-induced ET-1 and also inhibited activation of NF-kappaB in astrocytes. Our findings suggest that ET-1 may be critical in mediating the neuropathogenesis of HIV dementia and that statins may have therapeutic potential in these patients.", 
    "161": "The antiatherosclerotic effects of the dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blocker, benidipine hydrochloride (benidipine), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, pravastatin sodium (pravastatin), were compared in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Male, New Zealand white rabbits were fed a 0.5% cholesterol diet. Pravastatin (10 mg/kg) or benidipine (10 mg/kg) was orally administered once daily after start of feeding. After 8 weeks of cholesterol feeding, serum cholesterol was increased and endothelial function of thoracic aorta was impaired. Pravastatin prevented elevation of serum cholesterol and aortic tunica intima hyperplasia. Although benidipine had little effect on serum cholesterol, it significantly inhibited aortic tunica intima hyperplasia and impairment of endothelial function. Expression levels of the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) mRNA in aorta of hypercholesterolemic rabbit were higher than those of normal rabbit. Benidipine significantly prevented upregulation of VCAM-1 mRNA expression and showed a tendency to inhibit elevation of LOX-1 mRNA expression. Pravastatin significantly prevented upregulation of both VCAM-1 and LOX-1 mRNA expression. The results demonstrate that pravastatin inhibits increase of serum cholesterol and vascular dysfunction in hypercholesterolemic rabbit. Benidipine is effective in preventing vascular hyperplasia without altering serum cholesterol levels and this may be due to inhibition of expression of VCAM-1.", 
    "162": "Statins reduce cholesterol synthesis and are widely used for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia and ischaemic heart disease. Besides their cholesterol-lowering effects, statins also possess broad immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Vascular endothelial cells have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disease, and, alongside leukocytes and antigen-presenting cells, represent a key cellular target for statin therapy. Recent studies investigating how these drugs modify endothelial cell function demonstrate that the therapeutic effect of statins can be attributed, in part, to their action on the endothelium. Accordingly, statins attenuate endothelial MHC class II expression, increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase and fibrinolytic activity, decrease leukocyte adhesion and transmigration, and enhance resistance to local injurious stimuli. Many of these effects are brought about by the modulation of small GTPase function and the downregulation of proinflammatory gene expression.", 
    "163": "Apoptosis is essential for the initiation and progression of vascular calcification. Recently, we showed that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have a protective effect against vascular smooth muscle cell calcification by inhibiting apoptosis, where growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) plays a pivotal role. In the present study, we clarified the downstream targets of Gas6-mediated survival signaling in inorganic phosphate (Pi)-induced apoptosis and examined the effect of statins. We found that fluvastatin and pravastatin significantly inhibited Pi-induced apoptosis and calcification in a concentration-dependent manner in human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC), as was found with atorvastatin previously. Gas6 and its receptor, Axl, expression were downregulated in the presence of Pi, and recombinant human Gas6 (rhGas6) significantly inhibited apoptosis and calcification in a concentration-dependent manner. During apoptosis, Pi suppressed Akt phosphorylation, which was reversed by rhGas6. Wortmannin, a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, abolished the increase in Akt phosphorylation by rhGas6 and eliminated the inhibitory effect of rhGas6 on both Pi-induced apoptosis and calcification, suggesting that PI3K-Akt is a downstream signal of the Gas6-mediated survival pathway. Pi reduced phosphorylation of Bcl2 and Bad, and activated caspase 3, all of which were reversed by rhGas6. The inhibitory effect of statins on Pi-induced apoptosis was accompanied by restoration of the Gas6-mediated survival signal pathway: upregulation of Gas6 and Axl expression, increased phosphorylation of Akt and Bcl2, and inhibition of Bad and caspase 3 activation. These findings indicate that the Gas6-mediated survival pathway is the target of statins' effect to prevent vascular calcification.", 
    "164": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is often associated with risk factors including cigarette smoking, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, and patients have a high risk of future vascular events. Good medical management results in improved outcomes and quality of life, but previous studies have documented sub-optimal treatment of risk factors. We assessed the management of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with PAD referred to specialist vascular clinics.", 
    "165": "This was a prospective, protocol driven registry carried out in UK vascular clinics. Patients who were first-time referrals for evaluation of PAD were eligible if they had claudication plus ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) < or = 0.9. Statistical associations between key demographic and treatment variables were explored using a chi-squared test.", 
    "166": "We enrolled 473 patients from 23 sites. Mean age was 68 years (SD 10) and 66% were male. Mean estimated claudication distance was 100 m, and ABPI was 0.74. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 155 mmHg, and 42% had a SBP >160 mmHg. Forty percent were current smokers and half had tried to give up in the prior 6 months, but there was no evidence of a systematic method of smoking cessation. Mean total cholesterol was 5.4 (SD1.2) mmol/l and 30% had levels >6 mmol/l. Antiplatelet therapy had been given to 70% and statins to 44%. Prior CHD was present in 29% and these patients had significantly higher use of antiplatelet therapy, statins and ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "167": "In spite of attempts to raise awareness about PAD as an important marker of cardiovascular risk, patients are still poorly treated prior to referral to a vascular clinic. In particular, the use of evidence-based treatments is sub-optimal, while hypertension and cigarette smoking are poorly managed. More work needs to be done to educate health professionals about the detection and optimal medical management of PAD.", 
    "168": "Statins have anti-inflammatory effects that are not directly related to their cholesterol-lowering activity. This study aimed to investigate the effect of simvastatin on the extent of tissue damage in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. The rats received a single intravenous injection of 2.5mgkg(-1) cisplatin. Other groups received either simvastatin (1mgkg(-1)) or the vehicle (ethanol:saline) intraperitoneally for 10 days beginning 5 days prior to cisplatin injection. All animals were decapitated 5 days after cisplatin administration. Trunk blood was collected and analyzed for blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), albumin, and total bilirubin levels. The urine samples were used for the calculation of creatinine clearance levels. The kidney and liver samples were stored for the measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and collagen content or were processed for histopathological examinations. Formation of reactive oxygen species in tissue samples was monitored by using chemiluminescence method. Simvastation reduced the extent of both kidney and liver damage and preserved both kidney and liver functions (p<0.01-0.001). Increase in liver MDA level with a concomitant reduction in GSH in the cisplatin group was attenuated by simvastatin treatment (p<0.05-0.01). Increase in tissue collagen content and chemiluminescence levels in the kidney and liver samples of the cisplatin group was also reversed by simvastatin (p<0.001). In conclusion, simvastatin is beneficial in cisplatin-induced kidney and liver dysfunction and organ damage in rats via prevention of lipid peroxidation and tissue fibrosis, preservation of antioxidant glutathione, and suppression of neutrophil infiltration.", 
    "169": "We hypothesize that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) significantly reflect serial changes in patients with atherosclerotic-risk factors undergoing simvastatin therapy. We further hypothesize that the site specificity of CRP on the expression of CAMs, which can be inhibited by simvastatin, is in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells (EC).", 
    "170": "Serum hs-CRP levels and vascular (V) CAM-1 were measured (on days 0, 30, 90, 180 and 270) in 59 study subjects with at least one atherosclerotic-risk factor and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol >100 gm/dL. Simvastatin (40 mg/day) was given to each study subjects for 6 months. The inflammatory mediators were evaluated in 30 healthy subjects. Human umbilical vein (HUV) ECs were incubated with 1) culture medium alone, 2) added CRP for stimulation, and 3) simvastatin for 4 h before CRP was added. The hs-CRP and VCAM-1 levels were significantly higher on day 0 in study subjects than in healthy subjects (all p<0.0001). These inflammatory markers declined to a significantly lower level on day 90 (all p<0.001) and to an even lower level by day 180 (all p<0.0001). After simvastatin therapy was withdrawn, the hs-CRP level was once again significantly higher on day 270 than on day 180 (p<0.05), but VCAM-1 did not differ between day 180 and day 270. 25 micromol/L simvastatin markedly suppressed the CRP effect on VCAM-1 and intercellular CAM-1 expressions of EC. Immunocytochemical staining identified CRP in HUVEC cytoplasm. However, pretreatment with simvastatin reduced the intensity of CRP in cytoplasm.",
