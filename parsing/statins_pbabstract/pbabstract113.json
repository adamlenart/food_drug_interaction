The aim of this study was to analyze in vitro the vasoreactive properties in both vessels and to investigate the effects of pravastatin incubation on vascular function. IMA and RA rings obtained from patients undergoing CABG were studied in organ baths. We examined the contractile responses to phenylephrine and U46619 and the relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside. In another series of experiments, the vascular reactivity and the superoxide anion production were studied after incubation with pravastatin. The effect of mevalonic acid on such responses was also assessed. Our results show that RA significantly evoked greater tension in response to vasoconstrictor agents and higher relaxation to ACh than IMA. In contrast, relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside was not significantly different. Incubation with pravastatin reduced the contractile response to U46619 and improved the endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh in both arteries. Whereas the effect of pravastatin on response to U46619 was completely abolished by coincubation with mevalonic acid, only a partial inhibition on ACh relaxation was observed. In conclusion, in vitro incubation with pravastatin enhanced endothelial function in IMA and RA. This suggests that postoperative (may include intraoperative) administration of statins could improve the endothelial function of arterial grafts in patients undergoing CABG.", 
    "1": ": Development of cardiac hypertrophy after thyroxin (T4) treatment is well recognized. Recently, we observed that T4-induced cardiac hypertrophy is associated with increased cardiac Rac1 expression and activity. Whether this Rac1 increase has a role in inducing this cardiac phenotype is, however, still unknown. Here, we showed that T4 treatment (500 \u00b5g/kg/d) for 2 weeks resulted in increased myocardial Rac1 activity with subsequent hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and left ventricular systolic dysfunction in vivo. Isolated right ventricular papillary muscles of T4-treated mice maintained their peak isometric active developed tension but exhibited significant decreases in their corresponding time to peak and in relaxation times. Positive inotropic responses to increasing pacing rate and \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation were also depressed in these muscles. Pravastatin (10 mg/kg/d), a Rac1 inhibitor, significantly decreased myocardial Rac1 activity, hypertension, and cardiomyocyte size in T4-treated mice but could not attenuate gross heart weight or functional cardiac changes in these mice. Our data showed that T4 could activate different signaling pathways with distinct cardiovascular outcomes. We also provide the first mechanistic evidence for the partial involvement of Rac1 activation in T4-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and reveal a putative role for Rac1 in the development of T4-induced hypertension.", 
    "2": "Excessive proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts plays a critical role in myocardial remodeling and the development of chronic heart failure, and the inhibition of cardiac fibroblast proliferation may help in the prevention of heart failure. Recent studies indicate that aldosterone promotes fibroblast proliferation and that ERK1/2 is critically involved in this process. However, whether aldosterone promotes p-ERK1/2 expression in cardiac fibroblasts via the classic genomic or rapid nongenomic pathway is not fully understood, and the effect of statins on both of these pathways is poorly studied. In this study, we investigated the role of the ERK1/2 pathway in the antiproliferative effects of atorvastatin, in the context of aldosterone-induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation.",

A total of 314 subjects were analyzed in this subanalysis, 282 of whom were eligible for evaluation of the relationship between LDL-C and carotid mean-IMT change. In the subanalysis, we evaluated the extent to which intensive lipid-lowering therapy slowed the mean-IMT progression by a correlation analysis between LDL-C and mean-IMT change after 12 months of statin treatment. Nearly half were male (49.4%) and elderly (49.7%). The majority (84.4%) were treated for primary prevention. Patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus accounted for 65.3% and 44.0%, respectively. At the 12-month measurement point, mean-IMT change was correlated with LDL-C (R = 0.187; P = 0.0016), LDL-C/ HDL-C ratio (R = 0.152; P = 0.0105), and non-HDL-C (R = 0.132; P = 0.0259). Mean-IMT after 12 months was divided into 4 subgroups by LDL-C at 12 months; < 80, \u2265 80 to < 100, \u2265 100 to < 120, and \u2265 120 mg/dL. A trend analysis using the Jonckheere-Terpstra test showed statistical signifi cance (P = 0.0002). Even for prevention in Japanese patients who have lower risk of atherosclerotic disease than Western patients, lowering the LDL-C level to below the therapeutic target prevented mean-IMT progression after 12 months more strongly. These findings suggest that more intensive control of LDL-C to levels lower than those in current JAS guidelines should be required to achieve slowing of progression as well as induction of regression of atherosclerosis.",

Nevertheless, apoB48 was higher in CAD patients than in those without CAD (p<0.001). After adjusting for classic cardiovascular risk factors, multivariate logistic regression analyses showed apoB48 to be an independent predictor of coronary risk in new-onset or chronic CAD, irrespective of the LDL-C levels. Moreover, apoB48 was markedly increased during the follow-up period in CAD patients having new lesion progression after the prior PCI.",

    "15": "Statins are inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins effectively prevent and reduce the risk of coronary artery disease through lowering serum cholesterol, and also exert anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects independently of changes in cholesterol levels. On the other hand, clinical and experimental evidence suggests that abrupt cessation of statin treatment (i.e. statin withdrawal) is associated with a deleterious rebound phenomenon. In fact, statin withdrawal increases the risk of thrombotic vascular events, causes impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation and facilitates experimental seizures. However, evidence for statin withdrawal-induced detrimental effects to the brain parenchyma is still lacking. In the present study adult male Wistar rats were treated with atorvastatin for seven days (10mg/kg/day) and neurochemical assays were performed in the cerebral cortex 30 min (atorvastatin treatment) or 24h (atorvastatin withdrawal) after the last atorvastatin administration. We found that atorvastatin withdrawal decreased levels of nitric oxide and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activity, whereas increased NADPH oxidase activity and immunoreactivity for the protein nitration marker 3-nitrotyrosine in the cerebral cortex. Catalase, glutathione-S-transferase and xanthine oxidase activities were not altered by atorvastatin treatment or withdrawal, as well as protein carbonyl and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal immunoreactivity. Immunoprecipitation of mitochondrial SOD followed by analysis of 3-nitrotyrosine revealed increased levels of nitrated mitochondrial SOD, suggesting the mechanism underlying the atorvastatin withdrawal-induced decrease in enzyme activity. Altogether, our results indicate the atorvastatin withdrawal elicits oxidative/nitrosative damage in the rat cerebral cortex, and that changes in NADPH oxidase activity and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activities may underlie such harmful effects.",

Six human breast cancer cell lines, both receptor rich and receptor poor, were studied.Panobinostat (LBH-589), a pan histone deacetylase inhibitor with a multitude of biological effects, exhibits time-dependent synergistic effects in breast cancer cell lines with docetaxel, doxorubicin, or gemcitabine in clinically relevant concentrations. Survivin expression was markedly downregulated in the presence of panobinostat with gemcitabine. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor,markedly enhanced the cytotoxic effects of panobinostat combined with gemcitabine. Panobinostat did not demonstrate universal enhancement of cytotoxic drugs,and therefore, synergy was dependent on the second agent selected. No synergy was noted with anti-Her2 agents in Her2 overexpressing cell lines. Metformin combined with panobinostat demonstrated no synergy in this test system. These effects were confirmed by an apoptosis assay and caspase-3 production. A positive drug interaction was identified. The triplet of panobinostat with either doxorubicin/carboplatin or gemcitabine/carboplatin was especially potent in all cell lines. As all these agents are clinically available, further studies of the potent combinations are warranted.", 
    "26": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multi-systemic syndrome caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 gene. In TSC2-null cells, Rheb, a member of the Ras family of GTPases, is constitutively activated. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and block the synthesis of isoprenoid lipids with inhibition of Rheb farnesylation and RhoA geranylgeranylation. The effects of rosuvastatin on the function of human TSC2(-/-) and TSC2(-/meth) \u03b1-actin smooth muscle (ASM) cells have been investigated. The TSC2(-/-) and TSC2(-/meth) ASM cells, previously isolated in our laboratory from the renal angiomyolipoma of two TSC patients, do not express tuberin and bear loss of heterozigosity caused by a double hit on TSC2 and methylation of TSC2 promoter, respectively. Exposure to rosuvastatin affected TSC2(-/meth) ASM cell growth and promoted tuberin expression by acting as a demethylating agent. This occurred without changes in interleukin release. Rosuvastatin also reduced RhoA activation in TSC2(-/meth) ASM cells, and it required coadministration with the specific mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor rapamycin to be effective in TSC2(-/-) ASM cells. Rapamycin enhanced rosuvastatin effect in inhibiting cell proliferation in TSC2(-/-) and TSC2(-/meth) ASM cells. Rosuvastatin alone did not alter phosphorylation of S6 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and at the higher concentration, rosuvastatin and rapamycin slightly decreased ERK phosphorylation. These results suggest that rosuvastatin may potentially represent a treatment adjunct to the therapy with mTOR inhibitors now in clinical development for TSC. In particular, rosuvastatin appears useful when the disease is originated by epigenetic defects.", 
    "27": "Statins have been confirmed with protective effect to microvessels in diabetic retinopathy, implicated as reducing vascular permeability, maintaining endothelial junction integrity and improving blood perfusion, which are surrogate markers of vascular 'normalization', but no data are currently available on efficacy of statins on tumor endothelial functions. Since statins have been shown to exhibit a biphasic dose-related response on biological behaviour of microvessels, we sought to determine whether statins with bipolar concentrations can ameliorate vessel dysfunction and then increase efficiency of chemotherapeutics in Lewis lung carcinoma and B16F10 melanoma models. Our in vitro study showed that simvastatin reduces hypoxia-induced endothelium leakage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a concentration-dependent manner. In tumor-bearing mice, low-dose simvastatin (0.2 mg/kg) induced upregulation of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) skewed vessels to a pericyte-coated and stable pattern, while high-dose simvastatin (10 mg/kg) remarkably deceased reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1\u03b1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, attenuating VEGF-drived tumor vessel hyperpermeability. These changes ultimately improved intratumoral perfusion and decreased tumor hypoxia. Administration of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide to the simvastatin-treated mice resulted in slower tumor growth. Collectively, simvastatin may promote tumor vessel normalization and show clinical benefit when used in combination with chemotherapeutics.",

The enzymatic bioconversion of rutin to Q-3-G was repetitively performed, yielding 84% after 5 batches with little quercetin formation. Interestingly, the water solubility of Q-3-G was enhanced 69- and 328-fold over those of rutin and quercetin, which may make Q-3-G more bioavailable in food. Q-3-G was approximately 6- and 1.4-fold more potent than rutin as an inhibitor of human intestinal maltase and human DL-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutalyl coenzyme A reductase. Q-3-G was less potent (16- and 1.3-fold, respectively) than quercetin as an inhibitor of these enzymes.

Recently, we showed that the antihyperlipidemic drug probucol, which induces QT prolongation, decreases the I(Ks) after 24-h treatment. In the present study, we investigated the effects of three cholesterol-lowering agents (probucol, an enhancer of cholesterol efflux; simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; and triparanol, a 3\u03b2-hydroxysterol-\u25b524-reductase inhibitor) on cholesterol synthesis, the KCNQ1 current (I KCNQ1), and the I(Ks) to clarify the differences in the modes of action of these agents on the I(Ks). Probucol did not inhibit cholesterol synthesis and had no effect on I KCNQ1, while I(Ks) decreased after 24-h treatment. Simvastatin inhibited cholesterol synthesis and decreased I KCNQ1 and I(Ks). Additionally, the activation kinetics of I(Ks) became faster, compared with that of control I(Ks). Triparanol inhibited cholesterol synthesis but did not reduce I KCNQ1 and I(Ks). However, the activation kinetics of I(Ks) became faster. Our data indicated that the mechanism by which probucol inhibits I(Ks) was not mediated by the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis but depended on an interaction with the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex. Meanwhile, the reduction in cholesterol induced by simvastatin and triparanol is one of the mechanisms that affects the kinetics of I(ks).",

Evidence suggesting shared common risk factors and mirrored pathophysiology between cardiovascular disease and AMD led to the hypothesis that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) could be helpful in preventing AMD. For over a decade, observational studies have repeatedly investigated this hypothesis with conflicting conclusions. Although many reports conclude that statin use has no effect on the risk of AMD, no randomized controlled trial has yet been completed. Furthermore, relatively few studies factor characteristics of statin use into their analysis. A few studies have observed an incompletely explained protective effect against drusen, a funduscopic finding associated with AMD. Although there is insufficient evidence for a preventive effect of statins on dry AMD, there does seem to be stronger evidence against any effect on the development of exudative AMD. Overall, we find that there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether statin use is helpful in preventing AMD.",

The role of medical management has been very actively investigated and reported, particularly because of the global disease burden and the associated high morbidity and mortality.

However, individuals being treated with a statin continue to experience a high residual risk of events. Here we review the evidence that lowering LDL-C levels beginning earlier in life, and therefore earlier in the atherosclerotic disease process, can prevent or substantially delay the development of atherosclerosis and thereby substantially improve the clinical benefit of therapies that lower LDL-C levels.

As well, three studies using discordance analysis each demonstrated that apoB and LDL-P were superior to the cholesterol markers. Two approaches to resolve these differences are brought to bear in this article: first, which results are credible and second, how does taking the known differences in LDL composition into account, help resolve them.

RESULTS: The statins administered intraperitoneally or orally at any dose did not significantly enhance the total survivors relative to untreated controls. In addition, infected mice receiving any concentration of statin were not protected against weight loss due to the infection. None of the statins significantly increased the mean day of death relative to mice in the placebo treatment group. Furthermore, the statins had relatively few ameliorative effects on lung pathology or lung weights at day 3 and 6 after virus exposure, although mice treated with simvastatin did have improved lung function as measured by arterial saturated oxygen levels in one experiment.

    "48": "The relationship between low concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and heightened risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease has been known for decades. Despite the consistent inverse relationship among epidemiological studies, the linkage between a residual low HDL-C among patients treated with statins and excess cardiovascular risk is less clearly established. Encouraging results from trials using niacin over the past 40 years have not been validated among more recent trials in patients taking contemporary anti-atherosclerotic therapy. Emerging evidence suggests that certain subsets of HDL particles may be more protective and/or more closely associated with CV disease than others, which may impact therapeutic benefits. Ongoing clinical trials will clarify whether raising HDL-C per se directly translates into a reduction in hard CV events. Until those results are available, the clinician is left with only weak evidence to support whether or not to target treatment of HDL-C with pharmacological therapy.",

Serum Mg levels in the patients with IGT, IFG, T2D, and T1D were significantly lower than that of control. The urinary Mg levels were significantly increased only in T2D and T1D patients compared to control. There was no difference for these two changes among T2D with and without complications; In addition, there was a significantly positive correlation of serum Mg levels with serum Ca levels only in T2D patients, and also a significantly positive correlation of urinary Mg levels with urinary Ca levels in control, IGT patients, and T2D patients. Simvastatin treatment in T2D patients selectively reduced serum Ca levels and urinary Mg levels.

We present 3 cases of adverse reactions in Achilles tendon xanthomas after the addition of niacin and bile acid sequestrants to ongoing statin therapy. Reduction in tendon dimensions and marked softening of xanthomas were interpreted as cholesterol removal from heavily infiltrated tissue sites. In 2 cases, changes in the xanthomas occurred despite only minor lipoprotein improvements, raising the possibility of direct drug effects in cholesterol-infiltrated tissue. Intriguingly, recent studies have described niacin receptor-mediated effects in macrophages. In summary, although adverse reactions in Achilles tendon xanthomas appear to be infrequent, clinicians should be aware of this phenomenon in their patients after intensifying lipid treatments, especially with the use of niacin in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

Transverse tubular (T-tubular) vacuolations occur in patients having statin-associated myopathy and, to a lesser extent, in statin-treated patients without myopathy. We have investigated quantitative changes in T-tubular morphology and looked for early indicators of T-tubular membrane repair in skeletal muscle biopsy samples from patients receiving cholesterol-lowering therapy who do not have myopathic side effects. Gene expression and protein levels of incipient membrane repair proteins were monitored in patients who tolerated statin treatment without myopathy and in statin-naive subjects. In addition, morphometry of the T-tubular system was performed. Only the gene expression for annexin A1 was up-regulated, whereas the expression of other repair genes remained unchanged. However, annexin A1 and dysferlin protein levels were significantly increased. In statin-treated patients, the volume fraction of the T-tubular system was significantly increased, but the volume fraction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum remained unchanged. A complex surface structure in combination with high mechanical loads makes skeletal muscle plasma membranes susceptible to injury. Ca(2+)-dependent membrane repair proteins such as dysferlin and annexin A1 are deployed at T-tubular sites. The up-regulation of annexin A1 gene expression and protein points to this protein as a biomarker for T-tubular repair.",

Thus, this study evaluated the roles of Rac1 geranylgeranylation and the relationship between Rac1 and \u03b1N-catenin in the protective activity of atorvastatin (ATV) in a cortical neuronal culture model of glutamate (GLU) excitotoxicity. We found that ATV-induced neuroprotection and plasticity were blocked by isoprenoids, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), inhibition of farnesylation (FTI-277) and geranylgeranylation (GGTI-286), down-regulation of GGTase-I\u03b2 and Rac activity and promotion of active RhoA. Additionally, ATV rescued the distribution of dendritic \u03b1N-catenin and increased the number and length of dendritic branches; these effects were reversed by GGTI-286, GGTase-I\u03b2 shRNA, Rac1 shRNA and a dominant-negative version of Rac1 (T17N). In summary, our findings suggest that ATV requires GGTase-I\u03b2, prenylation and active Rac1 to induce protection and plasticity. In this regard, \u03b1N-catenin is a marker for stable interactions between adhesion proteins and the actin cytoskeleton and is necessary for the neuroprotective action of ATV.",

Early statin treatment has been reported to cause regression of plaques away from the site of the culprit lesion in patients with acute coronary syndrome. However, the precise mechanism of coronary plaque regression is not well understood. We studied the effects of statins on the regression of coronary plaques away from the culprit lesions in 120 patients with acute coronary syndrome. We used virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound studies to evaluate nonpercutaneous coronary intervention lesions at admission and short-term (2 to 3 weeks) and medium-term (8 to 10 months) follow-up. According to the medium-term evaluation findings, the subjects were divided into 2 groups: a plaque regression group (n = 94) and a plaque progression group (n = 26). In the regression group, the fibrofatty component had decreased at the short-term (-20.0% vs baseline) and had decreased further at the medium-term (-26.7%) evaluations. The fibrous component had also decreased at the short-term (-5.1%) and medium-term (-8.5%) evaluations. In contrast, the necrotic core component showed a tendency to increase in the short term (+12.5%) but then decreased at the medium-term evaluation (-6.3%). In the progression group, the fibrofatty and fibrous components had increased at the short-term (+37.5%, +11.3%) and medium-term (+50.5%, +13.2%) evaluations; however, the necrotic core had decreased at the short-term (-19.0%) and medium-term (-23.8%) evaluations. In conclusion, regarding the course of coronary plaque regression by statin therapy, the plaques began to reduce the volume of fibrofatty and fibrous components in the early phase, associated with a transiently increased necrotic core component.

Although TF(+) microvesicles are shed from cells that express nascent TF transcript in response to injury, recent findings revealed that circulating, full-length TF protein is detectable prior to these nascent transcripts. This finding suggested that the protein is released from constitutive sources as an acute response. We examined whether Staphylococcus aureus, the Gram-positive bacteria that is emerging as one of the most common etiologic agents in sepsis, is capable of stimulating the release of TF(+) microvesicles from a pulmonary cell line that constitutively expresses TF protein. We found that host cell invasion stimulated an acute release of TF(+) microvesicles and that these microvesicles mediated the transfer of the protein to TF-negative endothelial cells. We also found that transfer was inhibited by cholesterol-lowering simvastatin. Taken together, our findings reveal that S. aureus pathogenesis extends to the acute release of TF(+) microvesicles and that inhibiting dispersal by this mechanism may provide a therapeutic target.",

Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a protein-binding uremic toxin with a potential role in endothelial injury. In this study, we examined the effects and mechanisms of action of IS on EPCs in AKI. Forty-one consecutive patients (26 male; age, 70.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.1\u00a0years) diagnosed with AKI according to the AKIN criteria were enrolled. The AKI patients had higher serum IS levels than patients with normal kidney function (1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.94\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-4)M vs. 0.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-4)M, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). IS levels were negatively correlated to the number of double-labeled (CD34(+)KDR(+)) circulating EPCs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After IS stimulation, the cells displayed decreased expression of phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, increased reactive oxygen species, decreased proliferative capacity, increased senescence and autophagy, as well as decreased migration and angiogenesis. These effects of IS on EPCs were reversed by atorvastatin. Further, exogenous administration of IS significantly reduced EPC number in Tie2-GFP transgenic mice and attenuated NO signaling in aortic and kidney arteriolar endothelium after kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice, and these effects were restored by atorvastatin. Our results are the first to demonstrate that circulating IS is elevated in AKI and has direct effects on EPCs via NO-dependent mechanisms both in vitro and in vivo. Targeting the IS-mediated pathways by NO-releasing statins such as atorvastatin may preempt disordered vascular wall pathology, and represent a novel EPC-rescued approach to impaired neovascularization after AKI.",

These results may be attributed to the fact that ticagrelor, in contrast to clopidogrel, significantly increases the potency of CYP3A4-metabolized statins, which in turn may increase the vascular benefit derived from the statin, giving an unfair advantage to ticagrelor. Moreover, inappropriate statin dosing restrictions (underdosing of simvastatin and lovastatin) were deliberately utilized in PLATO, potentially contributing to the beneficial effect of ticagrelor.",

It is common knowledge that only 30% of hypertensive patients can be controlled using monotherapy; all the rest require a combination of two or more antihypertensive drugs, and this can be a barrier to good adherence and log-term persistence in patients who also often need to use other drugs, such as antidiabetic agents, statins or antiplatelet agents. The fixed combinations of three antihypertensive agents currently available can facilitate long-term control of these patients in clinical practice.

    "136": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a major component of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), contributes to the high risk of cardiovascular morbidity. We have previously demonstrated that IH-induced oxidative stress is involved in the hypertension and in the hypersensitivity to myocardial infarction. However, the mechanisms underlying these cardiovascular alterations are still unclear, as well as the role of potential protective treatment. Atorvastatin has pleiotropic actions, including increasing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and reducing inflammation and oxidative damage. The aim of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effect of a two time course of this treatment against the deleterious cardiovascular consequences of IH. Rats were divided into two groups subjected to chronic IH or normoxic (N) exposure. IH consisted of repetitive one-minute cycles (with only 30 s of a 5% inspired O2 fraction) and was applied for eight hours during daytime, for 14 (simultaneous protocol) or 28 d (delayed protocol). Atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/ d) or its vehicle was administered during the 14 d simultaneous protocol or the last 14 d of the delayed protocol. For both protocols, systolic arterial pressure was significantly increased by 14 d IH exposure. Atorvastatin prevented this deleterious effect in the simultaneous protocol. Carotid artery compliance and endothelial function were significantly altered after 28 d but not after 14 d of IH exposure. Delayed atorvastatin administration preserved these vascular parameters. IH also increased hypersensitivity to myocardial infarction after 14 d exposure, and atorvastatin abolished this deleterious effect. IH also enhanced cardiac NADPH expression and decreased aortic superoxide dismutase activity after 14 d exposure. Atorvastatin significantly restored these activities. In conclusion, whereas IH rapidly increased blood pressure, myocardial infarction hypersensitivity and oxidative stress, compliance, endothelial function and the structural wall of the carotid artery were only altered after a longer IH exposure. Atorvastatin prevented all these deleterious cardiovascular effects, leading to a potentially novel pharmacological therapeutic strategy for OSA syndrome.",

Analysis of expression of Egfl7 protein and transcripts in 211 human breast cancer samples shows that Egfl7 is strongly expressed by breast tumor cells. Egfl7 expression is significantly higher in invasive ductal than in invasive lobular carcinoma. Expression of Egfl7 transcripts is also higher in lower SBR grade lesions and in lesions which are not associated with lymph node invasion. Within the invasive ductal carcinoma sub-population, expression of Egfl7 transcripts is correlated with the SBR score and with the ER+ status. High transcript and Egfl7 protein levels significantly correlate with the absence of axillary lymph node invasion. In lymph nodes, the levels of Egfl7 are correlated with the histological type of the primary lesions; they are higher in ductal than in lobular carcinoma.

This was mediated by HMG-CoAR inhibition, because either mevalonate or geranylgeraniol prevented the cytotoxic effects of simvastatin. Continuous exposure for 4 days was necessary to cause cell death. Simvastatin caused accumulation of p62 but loss of Rab7, suggesting inhibition of autophagosome trafficking. Accumulation of LC3-II was also observed, even in the presence of bafilomycin, suggesting additional stimulation of an earlier step in autophagy. Knockdown of the key autophagy regulator Atg5 caused a modest increase in the sensitivity of Ovcar-8 cells to simvastatin. Finally, additive or mild antagonist effects were observed when simvastatin was combined simultaneously with either carboplatin or paclitaxel, but when cells were exposed to simvastatin prior to carboplatin, profound antagonism was observed.",

We also assessed the frequency of other classical risk factors of atherosclerosis. Hair selenium levels were found to be significantly higher in hyperlipidemic patients compared with volunteers with normal lipid levels. Also, a significantly increased number of traditional atherosclerosis risk factors were observed in hyperlipidemic patients with hair selenium concentrations above the median in contrast to those with below.

There was an eightfold increase in PPI utilization between 1997 and 2009, but only a twofold increase in reimbursed expenditure, helped by decreasing expenditure/DDD for the PPIs from \u20ac1.91 in 1997 to \u20ac0.52 in 2009. Similarly, a 20-fold increase was observed in statin utilization between 1997 and 2009, but only a fivefold increase in reimbursed expenditure, helped again by reimbursed expenditure/DDD decreasing from \u20ac2.05 in 1997 to \u20ac0.57 in 2009. Reduced co-payments for larger packs enhanced their prescription.",

    "164": "Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are multispecific transporters mediating the uptake of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics in tissues that are important for drug absorption and elimination, including the intestine and liver. Silymarin is a popular herbal supplement often used by patients with chronic liver disease; higher oral doses than those customarily used (140 mg three times/day) are being evaluated clinically. The present study examined the effect of silymarin flavonolignans on OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, and OATP2B1-mediated transport in cell lines stably expressing these transporters and in human hepatocytes. In overexpressing cell lines, OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated estradiol-17\u03b2-glucuronide uptake and OATP2B1-mediated estrone-3-sulfate uptake were inhibited by most of the silymarin flavonolignans investigated. OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, and OATP2B1-mediated substrate transport was inhibited efficiently by silymarin (IC\u2085\u2080 values of 1.3, 2.2 and 0.3 \u00b5M, respectively), silybin A (IC\u2085\u2080 values of 9.7, 2.7 and 4.5 \u00b5M, respectively), silybin B (IC\u2085\u2080 values of 8.5, 5.0 and 0.8 \u00b5M, respectively), and silychristin (IC\u2085\u2080 values of 9.0, 36.4, and 3.6 \u00b5M, respectively). Furthermore, silymarin, silybin A, and silybin B (100 \u00b5M) significantly inhibited OATP-mediated estradiol-17\u03b2-glucuronide and rosuvastatin uptake into human hepatocytes. Calculation of the maximal unbound portal vein concentrations/IC\u2085\u2080 values indicated a low risk for silymarin-drug interactions in hepatic uptake with a customary silymarin dose. The extent of silymarin-drug interactions depends on OATP isoform specificity and concentrations of flavonolignans at the site of drug transport. Higher than customary doses of silymarin, or formulations with improved bioavailability, may increase the risk of flavonolignan interactions with OATP substrates in patients.", 
    "165": "Polymorphonuclear neutrophils, the first leukocytes to infiltrate the inflamed tissue, can make important contributions to vascular inflammatory processes driving the development of atherosclerosis. We herein investigated the effects of atorvastatin and NCX 6560 (a nitric oxide (NO)-donating atorvastatin derivative that has completed a successful phase 1b study) on neutrophilic inflammation in carotid arteries of normocholesterolemic rabbits subjected to perivascular collar placement.", 
    "166": "Atorvastatin or NCX 6560 were administered orally (5 mg/kg/day or equimolar dose) to New Zealand White rabbits for 6 days, followed by collar implantation 1 h after the last dose. Twenty-four hours later carotids were harvested for neutrophil quantification by immunostaining.", 
    "167": "Treatment with NCX 6560 was associated with a lower neutrophil infiltration (-39.5 %), while atorvastatin did not affect neutrophil content. The result was independent of effects on plasma cholesterol or differences in atorvastatin bioavailability, which suggests an important role of NO-related mechanisms in mediating this effect. Consistent with these in vivo findings, in vitro studies showed that NCX 6560, as compared to atorvastatin, had greater inhibitory activity on processes involved in neutrophil recruitment, such as migration in response to IL-8 and IL-8 release by endothelial cells and by neutrophils themselves. Pretreatment with NCX 6560, but not with atorvastatin, reduced the ability of neutrophil supernatants to promote monocyte chemotaxis, a well-known pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils.",

Through a number of innovative approaches, KAMIR suggested new horizons about acute myocardial infarction (AMI) which contains unique features of Asian patients from baseline characteristics to treatment strategy. Obesity paradox was existed in Korean AMI patients, whereas no gender differences among them. KAMIR score suggested new risk stratifying method with increased convenience and an enhanced accuracy for the prediction of adverse outcomes. Standard loading dose of clopidogrel was enough for Asian AMI patients. Triple antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and cilostazol could improve clinical outcomes than dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. Statin improved clinical outcomes even in AMI patients with very low LDL-C levels. The rate of percutaneous coronary intervention was higher and door-to-balloon time was shorter than the previous reports. Zotarolimus eluting stents as the 2nd generation drug-eluting stent (DES) was not superior to the 1st generation DES, in contrast to the western AMI studies. KAMIR made a cornerstone in the study of Korean AMI and expected to be new standards of care for AMI with the renewal of KAMIR design to overcome its pitfalls.",

This finding is supported by the observed attenuation of 26Asn-LT\u03b13-mediated monocyte-endothelial interaction and ER stress in cardiomyocytes treated with pravastatin.

Twenty-four per cent of the patients (n = 737) had at least one prescription of statins during the follow-up period and the median duration of statin therapy was 1557 (5-4055) days. During a median follow-up of 1529 (1-4155) days, 285 (9.2%) patients experienced a recurrence. Treatment with statins was associated with a reduced risk of recurrent PE [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.50, 95% CI: 0.36-0.70], both during and after stopping VKA treatment.

We then construct double-shRNA libraries from these to systematically measure GIs between hits. A GI map focused on ricin susceptibility broadly recapitulates known pathways and provides many unexpected insights. These include a noncanonical role for COPI, a previously uncharacterized protein complex affecting toxin clearance, a specialized role for the ribosomal protein RPS25, and functionally distinct mammalian TRAPP complexes.

In order to reach strict LDL targets, high doses of statins may be required. However, the frequency of statin associated adverse effects and statin intolerance in clinical practice is high (up to 10-15% of statin users) especially at muscle level.

    "205": "Since December 2011, influenza virologists and biosecurity experts have been engaged in a controversial debate over research on the transmissibility of H5N1 influenza viruses. Influenza virologists disagreed with the NSABB's recommendation not to publish experimental details of their findings, whereas biosecurity experts wanted the details to be withheld and future research restricted. The virologists initially declared a voluntary moratorium on their work, but later the NSABB allowed their articles to be published, and soon transmissibility research will resume. Throughout the debate, both sides have had understandable views, but both have overlooked the more important question of whether anything could be done if one of these experimentally derived viruses or a naturally occurring and highly virulent influenza virus should emerge and cause a global pandemic. This is a crucial question, because during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, more than 90% of the world's people had no access to timely supplies of affordable vaccines and antiviral agents. Observational studies suggest that inpatient statin treatment reduces mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza. Other immunomodulatory agents (glitazones, fibrates and AMPK agonists) improve survival in mice infected with influenza viruses. These agents are produced as inexpensive generics in developing countries. If they were shown to be effective, they could be used immediately to treat patients in any country with a basic health care system. For this reason alone, influenza virologists and biosecurity experts need to join with public health officials to develop an agenda for laboratory and clinical research on these agents. This is the only approach that could yield practical measures for a global response to the next influenza pandemic.",

Splenectomy reduced brain interferon-\u03b3 (3 days) and infarct size (5 days) after stroke, and these effects were reversed by adoptive transfer of splenocytes. Simvastatin inhibited brain interferon-\u03b3 (3 days) and reduced infarct volume and neurological deficits (5 days) after stroke, and these protective effects were observed not only in naive stroke mice but also in splenectomied stroke mice adoptively transferred with splenocytes. Simvastatin also decreased the stroke-associated lung susceptibility to spontaneous bacterial infection.",

Importantly, not all statins are born equal. The statin class consists of a number of heterogenous drugs, which vary in properties such as potency in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lipophilicity, renoprotection, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lowering triglyceride levels, and effects on glucose metabolism and myocardial function. It remains unclear whether these differences significantly impact clinical outcomes or if 1 statin should be preferred over another. This review summarizes the properties of the 2 most potent statins available (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin), as well as assesses the comparative experimental and clinical trials that have been conducted on these 2 agents. We believe that the available body of evidence indicates that atorvastatin may have several advantages over rosuvastatin, despite the latter's greater potency, suggesting that atorvastatin should be the potent statin of choice, especially in treating patients with renal impairment or heart failure with concomitant coronary artery disease. The recent availability of atorvastatin as a generic option gives this drug another practical and compelling advantage over rosuvastatin.",

This review considers the beneficial effects of statins on patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass graft procedures and discusses the implicated pathomechanisms.", 
    "212": "Bioinformatic analysis of the genes coding for the chitinase in Pyrococcus furiosus and Thermococcus kodakarensis revealed that most likely a one nucleotide insertion in Pyrococcus caused a frame shift in the chitinase gene. This splits the enzyme into two separate genes, PF1233 and PF1234, in comparison to Thermococcus kodakarensis. Furthermore, our attempts to grow the wild type strain of Pyrococcus furiosus on chitin were negative. From these data we assume that Pyrococcus furiosus is most likely unable to use chitin as a carbon source. The aim of this study was to analyze in vivo if the one nucleotide insertion is responsible for the inability to grow on chitin, using a recently described genetic system for Pyrococcus furiosus.", 
    "213": "A marker-less genetic system for Pyrococcus furiosus was developed using simvastatin for positive selection and 6-methylpurine for negative selection. Resistance against simvastatin was achieved by overexpression of the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase gene. For the resistance to 6-methylpurine the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene was deleted. This system was used to delete the additional nucleotide at position 1006 in PF1234. The resulting chitinase in the mutant strain was a single subunit enzyme and aligns perfectly to the enzyme from Thermococcus kodakarensis. A detailed analysis of the wild type and the mutant using counted cell numbers as well as ATP and acetate production as growth indicators revealed that only the mutant is able to use chitin as a carbon source. An additional mutant strain containing a reduced chitinase version containing just one catalytic and one chitin-binding domain showed diminished growth on chitin in comparison to the mutant containing the single large enzyme.", 
    "214": "Wild type Pyrococcus furiosus is most likely unable to grow on chitin in the natural biotope due to a nucleotide insertion which separates the chitinase gene into two ORFs, whereas a genetically engineered strain with the deleted nucleotide is able to grow on chitin. The overall high sequence identity of the two chitinases between P. furiosus and T. kodakarensis indicates that this mutation occurred very recently or there is still some kind of selection pressure for a functional enzyme using programmed +/-1 frameshifting.",

The results of blood chemistry analysis were similar between the 2 groups. Low-dose ACh did not cause coronary spasms. The change in coronary artery diameter in response to ACh was lower in the VSA group (-1.4% \u00b1 9.3%) than in the nonVSA group (3.1% \u00b1 6.5%, P < 0.05), whereas nitroglycerin-induced coronary artery dilatation and coronary blood flow increase in response to ACh or coronary flow reserve did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.", 
    "218": "These findings suggest that microvascular coronary function may be preserved despite endothelial dysfunction of the epicardial coronary arteries in patients with VSA.", 
    "219": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are essential for maintaining vasculature homeostasis and function. By influence on its growth and activation both proinflammatory cytokines and peptides of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are potent regulators of VSMCs. Interestingly, angiotensin (Ang) II and Ang-(1-7) elicit opposite effects on VSMC activation, differentiation and proliferation. It has been suggested that statins, besides anti-inflammatory effects, may also modulate VSMC activation by their influence on the RAS.", 
    "220": "The effect of atorvastatin on Ang I metabolism in a culture of explanted rat VSMCs was examined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS); expression of mRNA of the main RAS enzymes in VSMC was assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).", 
    "221": "In VSMC culture Ang-(1-7) was identified as a major product of Ang I metabolism. In this setting, TNF-\u03b1 (1 ng/ml) caused a decrease in the conversion of Ang I to Ang-(1-7). This effect was accompanied by a decrease of mRNA expression of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and increase of mRNA of ACE. Interestingly, atorvastatin (3 \u03bcM) attenuated the effects of TNF-\u03b1 on Ang-(1-7) production as well as reversed the influence of TNF-\u03b1 on ACE and ACE2 expression.", 
    "222": "Enhancement by atorvastatin of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7) axis in VSMCs could represent a new and beneficial mechanism on cardiovascular action of this widely used drug.", 
    "223": "Despite remarkable advances in identifying and managing coronary heart disease, the global burden of cardiovascular (CV) risk and levels of undetected, subclinical heart disease remain enormous. Substantial numbers of patients do not reach their therapeutic goals, others are unable to tolerate the treatments, half may fail to adhere to their programs, and in those who do attain their targets, major cardiovascular events may continue. Well-known risk factors, such as obesity and diabetes, have now gained the upper hand, with no evidence-based remedy capable of reversing this trend. All told, less than 1% of American adults and adolescents qualify for ideal CV health; world-wide, the growing prevalence of CV risk factors in children is imposing. A number of novel emerging drug therapies are in development, some recently approved for use in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Hopefully, they will contribute significantly to the current therapeutic armamentarium. However, for meaningful improvement in total and residual CV risk, an optimal mix of all available modalities will likely be necessary, including earlier and more effective prevention, aggressive medical care, revascularization and device implantation, judicious use of novel agents, and reengineering of the environment.", 
    "224": "The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of HTN (HTN) and the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), amyloid alpha (AA) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) in persons with HTN, considering concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM) or metabolic syndrome (MS). This was a multicenter twelve-week, single-step titration, open-label study of individuals with dyslipidemia, assigned according to their initial risk assessment, to atorvastatin starting doses of 10, 20, 40 or 80\u2009mg. In subjects with HTN (N=677) versus no HTN (N=581), there were significantly (P<0.02) higher levels of CRP, IL-18, MCP-1 and AA but not for IL-18 when combined with DM or MS, and AA or CRP when combined with MS. Systolic blood pressure significantly (P<0.02) correlated with CRP, MCP-1 and AA but not IL-18. The greatest increase in CRP was with HTN plus DM. Statin therapy produced significant dose-dependent reductions in CRP but not with similar changes in other inflammatory markers. In summary, these data suggest a complex relationship between inflammation and HTN with dyslipidemia. Although HTN is associated with an increase in these inflammatory markers, the associated conditions DM or MS lead to different patterns of increases-MCP-1 being the most consistently increased with HTN, the greatest CRP increase was with HTN and DM, and no relationship was found with IL-18 and HTN in the presence of DM or MS. In addition, there are different responses to statins depending on the nature of the inflammatory marker.", 
    "225": "Lifestyle modifications including exercise are beneficial and fundamentally part of the therapy of metabolic syndrome, although in most of the cases medical interventions are also required to reach the target values in the laboratory parameters. Statin and fibrate combination therapy is considered to be safe and effective in dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome. However, increased physical activity can enhance the statin and fibrate-associated myopathy. Myositis and the rare but life-threatening rhabdomyolysis are causing a conflict between exercise and statin-fibrate therapy, which is yet to be resolved.", 
    "226": "We present a case of a 43-year-old Caucasian man with metabolic syndrome who had the side-effect of exercise and drug-associated myositis. The patient had only transient moderate complaints and rhabdomyolysis could be avoided with the one-month creatine kinase control, a test which is not recommended routinely by the new guidelines.", 
    "227": "We would like to turn the spotlight on the possible complications of statin-fibrate therapy and exercise, when strict follow-up is recommended. In this condition high number of patients can be affected and the responsibility of general practitioners is accentuated.", 
    "228": "The association between 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and bone mineral density (BMD) is controversial because of conflicting findings from previous studies.", 
    "229": "The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of statins on BMD reported in randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. We searched PubMed and Embase, using text, medical subject headings (MeSH) and keywords \"bone mineral density\" and \"statins\" or \"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors\". Our last PubMed and Embase queries were updated to August 2012. Data on participants, interventions, and outcomes from each study were abstracted independently by two authors.", 
    "230": "Five case-control studies, six cohort studies and four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. Included studies involved 34,877 subjects (3824 in the intervention group and 31,053 in the control group) in 12 different countries with ages ranging from 44 to 66 years. Statins significantly increased BMD at lumbar spine [standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.15, 95% CI 0.09-0.22], total hip (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.17-0.27) and femoral neck (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.09-0.29). We carried out subgroup analyses on selected populations of the cohorts. Statistically significant increases were also observed in the lumbar spine (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.04-0.21), total hip (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.17-0.28) and femoral neck BMD (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.36).", 
    "231": "The results of this study suggest that statins may help improve and maintain BMD at the lumbar spine, hip and femoral neck, especially in Caucasians and Asians. It also provides justification for prospective RCTs to evaluate the possible role of statins in BMD in different ethnic populations, such as Latin American and Africans."
