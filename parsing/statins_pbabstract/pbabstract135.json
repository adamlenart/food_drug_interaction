Whether statins express anti-inflammatory activities in the salivary glands in patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (pSS) is not known. The in vitro and in vivo effect of atorvastatin on rat submandibular gland treated with anti-M(3) peptide IgG purified from SS patients was studied. The anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin were assessed by measuring the levels of IL-1\u03b2, PGE(2) and MMP-3 by ELISA. Atorvastatin inhibited the increase in the production of IL-1\u03b2, PGE(2) and MMP-3 in submandibular glands treated with anti-M(3) peptide IgG. A positive correlation between IL-1\u03b2 production with accumulation of PGE(2) and MMP-3 was observed. Rats pre-treated orally with atorvastatin (30 mg kg(-1)) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered solution) once a day for three consecutive days impaired the increment in the production of IL-1\u03b2, PGE(2) and MMP-3 in the submandibular gland in the presence of anti-M(3) peptide IgG. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin are dependent upon inhibition of production of a pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1\u03b2) and pro-inflammatory mediators such as PGE(2) and MMP-3. These data suggest that atorvastatin may constitute an anti-inflammatory effect in SS.",

    "10": "There is a well-established link between dyslipidemia and cardiovascular events, although this risk is modified by age. Little is known about how treatment of dyslipidemia and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal attainment differ between older and younger patients. We obtained clinical data from 9,926 dyslipidemic patients across 9 countries in North and Latin America, Europe, and Asia from 2006 through 2007. Multivariate regressions were performed to determine predictors of lipid level goal attainment. The study sample consisted of 5,733 adults <65 and 4,193 adults \u226565 years old. Compared with younger patients, older patients were more likely to have diabetes (32.5% vs 30.0%, p = 0.0014) and hypertension (73.4% vs 57.0%, p <0.0001), to be classified as high risk (68.6% vs 53.2%, p <0.0001), and to be taking a statin (79.1% vs 72.0%, p <0.0001). However, they were less likely to smoke (8.2% vs 17.6%, p <0.0001) or to have metabolic syndrome (29.0% vs 34.4%, p <0.0001). Older patients had lower LDL cholesterol levels (95.1 vs 103.9 mg/dl, p <0.0001) and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (54.2 vs 51.5 mg/dl, p <0.0001). LDL cholesterol goal attainment was 74.7% in older and 71.1% in younger patients (p = 0.036). Older patients were more likely to achieve LDL targets whether low risk (89.8% vs 84.6%, p = 0.002), moderate risk (79.0% vs 71.9%, p = 0.0006), or high risk (70.5% vs 64.4%, p <0.0001). In conclusion, older patients had different risk profiles and better lipid levels compared with their younger counterparts. They were more likely to attain their LDL cholesterol goal, perhaps because of greater statin use, different risk profiles, or survival bias.", 
    "11": "High-dose rosuvastatin induces regression of coronary atherosclerosis, but it remains uncertain whether usual-dose statin has similar effects. We compared the effects of atorvastatin 20 mg/day versus rosuvastatin 10 mg/day on mild coronary atherosclerotic plaques (20% to 50% luminal narrowing and lesion length >10 mm) using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Three hundred fifty statin-naive patients with mild coronary atherosclerotic plaques were randomized to receive atorvastatin 20 mg/day or rosuvastatin 10 mg/day. IVUS examinations were performed at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Primary end point was percent change in total atheroma volume (TAV) defined as (TAV at 6 months - TAV at baseline)/(TAV at baseline) \u00d7 100. Evaluable IVUS was obtained for 271 patients (atorvastatin in 143, rosuvastatin in 128). Clinical characteristics, lipid levels, and IVUS measurements at baseline were similar between the 2 groups. At 6-month follow-up, percent change in TAV was significantly less in the atorvastatin group than in the rosuvastatin group (-3.9 \u00b1 11.9% vs -7.4 \u00b1 10.6%, respectively, p = 0.018). In contrast, change in percent atheroma volume was not different between the 2 groups (-0.3 \u00b1 4.2 vs -1.1 \u00b1 3.5, respectively, p = 0.157). Compared to baseline, TAV and TAV at the most diseased 10-mm subsegment were significantly decreased in the 2 groups (p <0.001). Changes in lipid profiles at 6-month follow-up were similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, usual doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin induced significant regression of coronary atherosclerosis in statin-naive patients, with a greater decrease in favor of rosuvastatin.", 
    "12": "Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common, progressive neurological disorder whose incidence is reaching epidemic proportions. The prevailing \"amyloid cascade hypothesis,\" which maintains that the aberrant proteolysis of beta-amyloid precursor protein (\u03b2APP) into neurotoxic amyloid beta (A\u03b2) peptides is central to the etiopathology of AD, continues to dominate pharmacological approaches to the clinical management of this insidious disorder. This review is a compilation and update on current pharmacological strategies designed to down-regulate A\u03b242 peptide generation in an effort to ameliorate the tragedy of AD. Areas covered: This review utilized online data searches at various open online-access websites including the Alzheimer Association, Alzheimer Research Forum; individual drug company databases; the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Medline; Pharmaprojects database; Scopus; inter-University research communications; and unpublished research data. Expert opinion: Anti-acetylcholinesterase-, chelation-, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist-, statin-, A\u03b2 immunization-, \u03b2-secretase-, \u03b3-secretase-based, and other strategies to modulate \u03b2APP processing, have dominated pharmacological approaches directed against AD-type neurodegenerative pathology. Cumulative clinical results of these efforts remain extremely disappointing, and have had little overall impact on the clinical management of AD. While a number of novel approaches are in consideration and development, to date there is still no effective treatment or cure for this expanding healthcare concern.", 
    "13": "We previously reported that the accuracy of clearance (CL) prediction could be differentiated by permeability. CL was drastically under-predicted by in vitro metabolic intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) for compounds with low permeability (<5 \u00d7 10(-6) cm/s). We determined apparent uptake CL(int) by measuring initial disappearance from medium using attached rat hepatocytes and metabolic CL(int) by measuring parent depletion in suspended rat hepatocytes (cells and medium). Uptake and metabolic CL(int) were comparable for highly permeable metabolic marker compounds. In contrast, uptake CL(int) was 3- to 40-fold higher than metabolic CL(int) for rosuvastatin, bosentan, and 15 proprietary compounds, which had low permeability, suggesting that uptake could be a rate-determining step in hepatic elimination for these poorly permeable compounds. The prediction of hepatic CL was improved significantly when using uptake CL(int) for the compounds with low permeability. The average fold error was 2.2 and 6, as opposed to >11 and >47 by metabolic CL(int), with and without applying a scaling factor of 4, respectively. Uptake CL(int) from attached hepatocytes can be used as an alternative approach to predict hepatic clearance and to understand the significance of hepatic uptake in elimination in an early drug discovery setting.",

The red yeast rice constituent monacolin K, also known as lovastatin, is an inhibitor of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. This article aims to develop a sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method to determine the total statin content of red yeast rice products.",

The relative standard deviations were consistently lower than 11%. The total statin concentrations of five red yeast rice supplements were between 1.5 and 25.2 mg per specified daily dose. A dose-dependent inhibition of the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity by the red yeast rice products was demonstrated.",

    "22": "The prevalence of obesity has been rising alarmingly and it has now become a global concern causing an enormous economic burden on the health care system. Obesity is generally linked to complications in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg, po) on obesity-induced oxidative stress in high fat-fed Wistar rats. Oral administration of rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg) for 21 days along with high fat diet brought about significant elevation in serum high density lipoprotein and cardiac antioxidant enzymes levels (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase-, glutathione reductase- and glutathione-S-transferase) while decreasing in serum lactate dehydrogenase, apolipoprotein-B, lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and atherogenic index) and cardiac thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels. The results were comparable with orlistat, a standard antiobesity drug. These preliminary results for the first time demonstrate that administration of rosuvastatin can be beneficial for the suppression of obesity-induced oxidative stress and dyslipidemia in high fat-fed Wistar rats.",

    "25": "We screened abstracts and full text articles of identified references for eligibility and reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for evidence on benefits and harms of CKD treatments. We reviewed RCTs and observational studies for evidence regarding possible benefits and harms of CKD screening or monitoring. For all included RCTs, data were extracted, quality was rated, and strength of evidence was graded. Evidence on the benefits and harms of CKD treatments was quantitatively synthesized when possible. Additional evidence on CKD screening and monitoring was qualitatively described.", 
    "26": "We found no RCTs of CKD screening or monitoring. In treatment RCTs, several interventions significantly reduced clinical events. In patients with proteinuria, nearly all with diabetes and hypertension, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (relative risk [RR], 0.60, 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.83) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (RR 0.77, 95 percent CI, 0.66 to 0.90) significantly reduced risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) versus placebo. In patients with microalbuminuria who had cardiovascular disease or diabetes with other cardiovascular risk factors, ACEI treatment reduced mortality risk (RR 0.79, 95 percent CI, 0.66 to 0.96) versus placebo. In individuals with hyperlipidemia and impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or creatinine clearance, HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) reduced risk of mortality (RR 0.80, 95 percent CI, 0.68 to 0.95), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke compared with placebo. However, limited data addressed whether these effects differed between patients with and without CKD or as a function of CKD severity. In RCTs that directly compared different treatments, including high dose versus low dose, combination versus monotherapy, and strict versus standard control, it was unclear whether intensification of treatment improves clinical outcomes. Reporting of study withdrawals and adverse events was limited. Based on treatment RCT findings and additional indirect data, including high CKD prevalence, low CKD recognition and limited CKD monitoring in usual care, uncertain sensitivity of screening and monitoring measures for CKD, and insufficient evidence on CKD screening and monitoring harms, the overall benefits of CKD screening and monitoring are unclear. The likelihood of benefit, if present, appears to be greater in specific subgroups. For example, individuals not being treated with ACEIs or ARBs who have cardiovascular disease or diabetes combined with other cardiovascular risk factors may benefit from screening for albuminuria. Individuals not being treated with a statin who have hyperlipidemia and no cardiovascular disease may benefit from screening for impaired eGFR. Younger patients, and those without diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or obesity, are the least likely to benefit from CKD screening. Individuals with impaired eGFR and at high risk for cardiovascular complications who are not being treated with ACEIs or ARBs may benefit from monitoring for incident albuminuria.", 
    "27": "No trials directly show a benefit for CKD screening or monitoring. The likelihood of benefit, if present, appears to be greater in specific subgroups. Screening and monitoring harms are poorly described. In selected CKD patients, ACEI or ARB treatment reduces ESRD risk, ACEI treatment reduces mortality risk, and statin treatment reduces risk of mortality, MI, and stroke. Many of these patients may already warrant treatment with these therapies regardless of CKD status. Many knowledge gaps remain, and additional research should increase understanding regarding optimal approaches to CKD screening, monitoring, and treatment.",

This study therefore aimed to investigate how anti-diabetic and cardioprotective agents affect human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs).", 
    "29": "The effect of anti-diabetic and cardioprotective agents on HCAEC viability, proliferation and apoptosis was studied. Viability was assessed using Trypan blue exclusion; proliferation in 5 mM and 11 mM of glucose was analyzed using [3H]thymidine incorporation. Lipoapoptosis of the cells was investigated by determining caspase-3 activity and the subsequent DNA fragmentation after incubation with the free fatty acid palmitate, mimicking diabetic lipotoxicity.", 
    "30": "Our data show that insulin, metformin, BLX-1002, and rosuvastatin improved HCAEC viability and they could also significantly increase cell proliferation in low glucose. The proliferative effect of insulin and BLX-1002 was also evident at 11 mM of glucose. In addition, insulin, metformin, BLX-1002, pioglitazone, and candesartan significantly decreased the caspase-3 activity and the subsequent DNA fragmentation evoked by palmitate, suggesting a protective effect of the drugs against lipoapoptosis.", 
    "31": "Our results suggest that the anti-diabetic and cardioprotective agents mentioned above have direct and beneficial effects on endothelial cell viability, regeneration and apoptosis.

While such impairment has been studied in NF1, the neural substrates remain unclear. The aim of this imaging add-on to a Phase 1 open-label trial was to examine the effect of lovastatin on Default Network (DN) resting state functional connectivity (RSFC). Seven children with NF1 (aged 11.9 \u00b1 2.2; 1 female) were treated with lovastatin once daily for 12 weeks. A 7-min 3-T echo-planar-imaging scan was collected one day before beginning treatment (off-drug) and the last day of treatment (on-drug) while performing a flanker task. After regressing-out task-associated variance, we used the residual time series as \"continuous resting-state data\" for RSFC analyses using 11 DN regions of interest. For qualitative comparisons, we included a group of 19 typically developing children (TDC) collected elsewhere. In the on-drug condition, lovastatin increased long-range positive RSFC within DN core regions (i.e., anterior medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex, PCC). In addition, lovastatin produced less diffuse local RSFC in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and PCC. The pattern of RSFC observed in the NF1 participants when on-drug closely resembled the RSFC patterns exhibited by the TDC. Lovastatin administration in this open trial regulated anterior-posterior long-range and local RSFC within the DN. These preliminary results are consistent with a role for lovastatin in normalization of developmental processes and with apparent benefits in a mouse NF1 model.",

Human umbilical vein ECs were treated with atorvastatin for 30 min or 2 h; lipid-raft proteins were isolated and examined by quantitative proteome assay. Functional classification of identified proteins in lipid rafts revealed upregulated antioxidative proteins; downregulated proteins were associated with inflammation and cell adhesion. Among proteins verified by Western blot analysis, endoplasmic reticulum protein 46 (ERp46) showed increased level in lipid rafts with atorvastatin. Further, atorvastatin inhibited the activation of membrane-bound NADPH oxidase in both untreated and angiotensin II-treated ECs, as shown by reduced reactive oxygen species production. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments revealed that atorvastatin increased the association of ERp46 and Nox2, an NADPH oxidase isoform, in lipid rafts, thereby inhibiting Nox2 assembly with its regulatory subunits, such as p47phox and p67phox. Our results reveal a novel antioxidative role of atorvastatin by promoting the membrane translocation of ERp46 and its binding with Nox2 to inhibit Nox2 activity in ECs, which may offer another insight into the pleiotropic functions of statins.",

The HFD induced a deranged lipid profile that was associated with adipose tissue hypertrophy, increased ratios of visceral and epididymal fats to body weight, and fatty liver. These perturbations were associated with hypo-adiponectinemia (50.8%) and increased serum TNF\u03b1 (6.5-fold) levels. Treatment with PIO ameliorated the altered blood and hepatic glucose metabolism via an Adp-dependent mechanism; PIO also mitigated the changes in blood TNF\u03b1 and led to a hyperelevation of Adp levels. SIM amended hepatic and overall lipid metabolism, regulated TNF\u03b1, but failed to alter the glucose intolerance or significantly impact on the HFD-altered Adp levels. Coadministration of SIM + PIO was superior in improving overall metabolic parameters compared to each monotherapy. Cotreatment was optimal in reestablishing insulin resistance, most efficacious in improving serum lipid profiles, normalizing percentage ratios of epididymal and visceral fats to body weight, and augmenting Adp/reducing TNF\u03b1 levels relative to that in the HFD group or with HFD + each drug alone. The results here show that use of either monotherapy or a combined SIM + PIO approach might, from a clinical perspective, provide an ability to delay progression to Type 2 diabetes and its associated inflammatory/cardiovascular effects.",

Ezetimibe (10 mg) was added to basal statin therapy for 12 weeks in 35 patients with hypercholesterolemia and a history of CAD who had not achieved their target cholesterol level with statin monotherapy. Changes in serum lipids, obesity markers, an oxidative stress marker, inflammatory markers, and laboratory values were investigated. Total cholesterol (from 200.6 \u00b1 30.4 mg/dL in week 0 to 173.4 \u00b1 33.3 mg/dL in week 12, P < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (121.3 \u00b1 29.4 vs. 94.6 \u00b1 30.4 mg/dL, P < 0.001), and remnant lipoprotein cholesterol (6.4 \u00b1 3.5 vs. 5.3 \u00b1 3.0 mg/dL, P < 0.05) all decreased significantly after addition of ezetimibe. The LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio also decreased significantly (2.5 \u00b1 0.8 in week 0 vs. 1.9 \u00b1 0.7 in week 12, P < 0.001). The percentage of patients achieving the target LDL-C level (<100 mg/dL) increased significantly (70.8\u00a0% in week 4 and 65.4\u00a0% in week 12, P < 0.001). There were no significant changes in the obesity or oxidative stress markers and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (an inflammatory marker).

In conclusion, when ezetimibe was added to basal statin therapy, serum lipids improved significantly and the rate of achieving the target cholesterol level increased. Thus, ezetimibe efficiently decreases LDL-C and might prevent arteriosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic patients with CAD when added to basal statin therapy.", 
    "89": "Large numbers of monocytes are recruited in the infarcted myocardium. Their cell membranes contain cholesterol-rich microdomains called lipids rafts, which participate in numerous signaling cascades. In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effect, pravastatin has several pleiotropic effects and is widely used as secondary prevention treatment after myocardial infarction (MI). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pravastatin on the organization of cholesterol within monocyte membrane rafts from patients who had suffered myocardial infarction. Monocytes from healthy donors and acute MI patients were cultured with or without 4\u03bcM pravastatin. Lipid rafts were extracted by Lubrol WX, caveolae and flat rafts were separated using a modified sucrose gradient. Cholesterol level and caveolin-1 expression in lipid rafts were determined. In healthy donors, cholesterol was concentrated in flat rafts (63\u00b13 vs 13\u00b11%, p<0.001). While monocytes from MI patients presented similar cholesterol distribution in both caveolae and flat rafts. Cholesterol distribution was higher in flat rafts in healthy donors, compared to MI patients (63\u00b13 vs 41\u00b12%, p<0.001), with less distribution in caveolae (13\u00b11 vs 34\u00b12%, p<0.001). Pravastatin reversed the cholesterol distribution in MI patients cells between flat rafts (41\u00b12 vs 66\u00b13%, p<0.001) and caveolae (34\u00b12 vs 18\u00b11%, p<0.001). In conclusion, MI redistributes cholesterol from flat rafts to caveolae indicating monocyte membrane reorganization. In vitro pravastatin treatment restored basal conditions in MI monocytes, suggesting another effect of statins.",

The risk of a PFO-related stroke over time is controversial and so is its prevention by device closure. The association of proximal aortic plaques in arteries subtending the brain and stroke is considered strong, ignoring that it is as putative as that of the PFO.

    "112": "In this contribution the ability of (19)F MAS NMR spectroscopy to probe structural variability of poorly water-soluble drugs formulated as solid dispersions in polymer matrices is discussed. The application potentiality of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a moderately sized active pharmaceutical ingredient (API, Atorvastatin) exhibiting extensive polymorphism. In this respect, a range of model systems with the API incorporated in the matrix of polvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was prepared. The extent of mixing of both components was determined by T(1)((1)H) and T(1\u03c1)((1)H) relaxation experiments, and it was found that the API forms nanosized domains. Subsequently it was found out that the polymer matrix induces two kinds of changes in (19)F MAS NMR spectra. At first, this is a high-frequency shift reaching 2-3 ppm which is independent on molecular structure of the API and which results from the long-range polarization of the electron cloud around (19)F nucleus induced by electrostatic fields of the polymer matrix. At second, this is broadening of the signals and formation of shoulders reflecting changes in molecular arrangement of the API. To avoid misleading in the interpretation of the recorded (19)F MAS NMR spectra, because both the contributions act simultaneously, we applied chemometric approach based on multivariate analysis. It is demonstrated that factor analysis of the recorded spectra can separate both these spectral contributions, and the subtle structural differences in the molecular arrangement of the API in the nanosized domains can be traced. In this way (19)F MAS NMR spectra of both pure APIs and APIs in solid dispersions can be directly compared. The proposed strategy thus provides a powerful tool for the analysis of new formulations of fluorinated pharmaceutical substances in polymer matrices.",

The ST-treated mice exhibited lower gains in BM (body mass; -8%; P<0.01) and visceral fat pad thickness (-60%; P<0.01) compared with the untreated HF group. In comparison with HF-diet-fed mice, HF+ST-treated mice showed a significant reduction in hepatomegaly and liver steatosis (-6%, P<0.05; and -21%, P<0.01 respectively). In HF+ST-treated mice, the hepatic TAG (triacylglycerol) levels were reduced by 58% compared with the HF group (P<0.01). In addition, the expression of SREBP-1c (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c) was decreased by 50% in the livers of HF+ST-treated mice (P<0.01) relative to the HF-diet-fed mice. The levels of resistin were lower in the HF+ST-treated group compared with the HF group (44% less, P< 0.01).

There is also mounting evidence that exercise may exacerbate these side effects, however the mechanisms are yet to be fully defined and there is controversy regarding the role that inflammation may play in the myopathy. This paper reports a patients experience during 6 months of simvastatin therapy and provides some insight into the white cell count (inflammation) following two bouts of moderate intensity exercise before and during statin therapy.

We further evaluated the use of nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and risk of these tumors. We recruited newly diagnosed glioma cases and frequency matched controls at Columbia University and the University of California San Francisco. Standardized questions on statins and NSAIDs were used at both institutions. Intakes of these drugs were defined as >6 months of at least twice weekly use versus less than this amount or never use. From July 2007 to January 2010, we recruited a total of 517 cases and 400 controls.

For NSAIDs, aspirin use was also inversely related to glioma risk (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.49, 0.96). Both statins and NSAIDs showed significant inverse trends between the duration of drug use and glioma risk (trend tests p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively), and drug intake for >120 months demonstrated the most significant associations for both types of medication. The inverse association between statin therapy and risk of glioma supports the roles of Ras/Rho GTPases or inflammatory cytokines in gliomagenesis, and a similar relationship between NSAIDs and glioma highlights the importance of cyclo-oxygenase 2 in glioma pathogenesis.",

NAFLD is an asymptomatic disease that can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is currently the most common cause of incidental abnormal liver tests and elevated serum liver enzyme activities in the developed world. Obesity, diabetes, and other components of the metabolic syndrome are frequently associated with the NAFLD. The treatment of NAFLD focuses on life-style modifications. Statins, fibrates, and other lipid-lowering agents have been proposed as effective lipid-lowering treatments in patients with NAFLD/NASH. However, clinicians are concerned that hyperlipidemic patients with NAFLD/NASH who are treated with statins could develop transaminitis. We assessed the efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering agents for NAFLD/NASH by reviewing reports of human studies including pilot, prospective, preliminary, and post hoc analysis studies on online databases during the period of 1980 to December 2012. The results of studies provide compelling evidence that lipid-lowering agents are safe and efficacious in patients with NAFLD/NASH and that some of these agents can induce a reduction in the extent of the hepatic steatosis. Well-designed randomized controlled studies of adequate size and duration with histological endpoints are needed in order to establish a suitable lipid-lowering treatment for hyperlipidemic patients with NAFLD/NASH, and for nonhyperlipidemic patients with NAFLD/NASH with a high risk for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "147": "Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) often have dyslipidemia along with other features of metabolic syndrome such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The dyslipidemia in NAFLD is characterized by increased serum triglycerides, increased small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL nontype A) particles, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The pathogenesis of dyslipidemia in NAFLD is not well understood, but it is likely related to hepatic overproduction of the very low-density lipoprotein particles and dysregulated clearance of lipoproteins from the circulation. There is unequivocal evidence that cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality in patients with NAFLD. Aggressive treatment of dyslipidemia plays a critical role in the overall management of patients with NAFLD. Statins are the first-line agents to treat high cholesterol and their dosage should be adjusted based on achieving therapeutic targets and tolerability. Although all statins appear to be effective in improving cholesterol levels in patients with NAFLD, there is more experience with atorvastatin in patients with NAFLD; furthermore, it is the only statin to date to show a reduced cardiovascular morbidity in patients with NAFLD. The risk for serious liver injury from statins is quite rare and patients with NAFLD are not at increased risk for statin hepatotoxicity. Omega-3 fatty acids are perhaps the first choice to treat hypertriglyceridemia because of their safety, tolerability, and efficacy in improving serum triglycerides, as well as their potential to improve liver disease.",

Our previous in vitro studies suggested that the interaction between C. neoformans hyaluronic acid and human brain endothelial CD44 could be the initial step of brain invasion. In this report, we used a CD44 knock-out (KO or CD44(-/-)) mouse model to explore the importance of CD44 in C. neoformans brain invasion. Our results showed that C. neoformans-infected CD44 KO mice survived longer than the infected wild-type mice. Consistent with our in vitro results, the brain and cerebrospinal fluid fungal burden was reduced in CD44-deficient mice. Histopathological studies showed smaller and fewer cystic lesions in the brains of CD44 KO mice. Interestingly, the cystic lesions contained C. neoformans cells embedded within their polysaccharide capsule and were surrounded by host glial cells. We also found that a secondary hyaluronic acid receptor, RHAMM (receptor of hyaluronan-mediated motility), was present in the CD44 KO mice. Importantly, our studies demonstrated an in vivo blocking effect of simvastatin. These results suggest that the CD44 and RHAMM receptors function on membrane lipid rafts during invasion and that simvastatin may have a potential therapeutic role in C. neoformans infections of the brain.",

Statins, the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been widely prescribed for hyperlipidemia, which could slow the atherosclerosis progression, and reduce cardiovascular disease events. Nonetheless, accumulated evidences suggested that statins exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory functions independent of their lipid-lowering effects. By the virtue of pleiotropic immunomodulatory property, statins may be applied for the treatment of both autoimmunity and atherosclerosis in patients with SLE. Interestingly, it has been well documented that regulatory T cells (Tregs) are involved in the pathogenesis of SLE as well as atherosclerosis. Meanwhile, studies have shown that statins could induce augmented number of Tregs with increased functional inhibitory properties. Thus, we hypothesized that the effect of statins ameliorating lupus disease manifestations and lupus-mediated atherogenesis might be mediated, at least partly, via the activation of Tregs. To our knowledge, this is the first hypothesis focused on that Tregs might be involved in the immunomodulatory effect of statins on SLE and SLE-related atherosclerosis.",

Also in TT carriers, the extent of excessive anticoagulation was >10-fold lower than in the other carriers. Both of these findings had a nominal P value of <0.05. After adjustment for false discovery rate, none of the findings remained significant at a threshold q value of <0.05.

Receiving pioglitazone also significantly reduces the concentration of immunoreactive insulin and blood glucose levels, significantly altered lipid metabolism, which generally leads to a lower level of systemic inflammation, metabolism and reduces the severity of insulin resistance. This allows you to recommend the inclusion of pioglitazone in complex coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome.",

The analytical procedure involves a liquid-liquid extraction method using nevirapine as an internal standard (IS). The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Hypurity Advance (4.6 \u00d7 50 mm, 5 \u00b5m) column using a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid buffer-acetonitrile (20:80, v/v) at flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The API-4000 LC-MS/MS was operated in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode using electrospray ionization. The total run time of analysis was 3 min and elution of AT, NA and IS occurred at 1.06, 1.84 and 0.92 min, respectively. A detailed validation of the method was performed as per the US Food and Drug Administration guidelines and the standard curves found to be linear in the range of 0.10-30.0 ng/mL for AT and 20.2-6026 ng/mL for NA, with a coefficient of correlation of \u2265 0.99 for both the compounds. AT and NA were found to be stable in a battery of stability studies, viz. bench-top, autosampler, re-injection, wet-extract and repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The developed assay method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in humans.", 
    "160": "The use of statins has scaled up to become one of the most prescribed medicines in the world and have been very useful in the manegement of cardiovascular diseases and related mortality. The disclosure of their chemical structure similar to that of hydroxy methyl glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) revealed their ability to compete with and inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase that catalyzes the synthesis of mevalonate, which then serves as the precursor for isoprenoids and cholesterol in the mevalonate pathway. While most of the effects of statins are associated with the lowering of cellular cholesterol levels, it is clear that they also blunt the non-sterol branch of the mevalonate pathway, decreasing formation of isoprenoids and altering protein-prenylation, a critical event in the posttranslational modulation of proteins involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, proliferation and signaling pathways. Randomized controlled trials for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases indicated that statins elicited provocative and unexpected benefits for reducing a number of different types of cancers, including colorectal carcinoma, melanoma, prostate and hepatocellular carcinoma, although in other cancer types the preclinical expectations of statins were dissapointing. In this review, we will describe the evidence and mechanisms underlying the potential beneficial use of statins and the role of protein prenylation in cancer prevention. Of relevance, the combination of statins with other anti cancer drugs may be a significant asset in malignancies resistant to current therapy.",

Chronic atorvastatin treatment significantly increased the seizure threshold which is induced by both intravenous and intraperitoneal pentylenetetrazol. Intraperitoneal pentylenetetrazol also decreased the incidence of tonic seizure and death in atorvastatin-treated groups. Chronic co-administration of a non-selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, l-NAME, or a selective inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, aminoguanidine, with atorvastatin inhibited atorvastatin-induced anticonvulsant effects in intravenous model of pentylenetetrazol. Acute injection of l-NAME or aminoguanidine inhibited the anticonvulsant effects of atorvastatin in both models of intravenous- and intraperitoneal-pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. In conclusion, we demonstrated that nitric oxide signaling probably through inducible nitric oxide synthase could be involved in the anticonvulsant effects of atorvastatin.",

Endothelial cells responded in a similar way to simvastatin and rosuvastatin. However, they were more sensitive to simvastatin. The statins had anti-inflammatory properties counteracting the TNF-\u03b1 effect on the hemostatic genes studied. There was no observed synergistic effect between shear stress and simvastatin. Simvastatin had a counteracting effect on t-PA and PAI-1 compared to TNF-\u03b1 and shear stress. Simvastatin blocked the TNF-\u03b1 suppressive effect on thrombomodulin and eNOS, irrespective of shear stress. The strong inductive effect of TNF-\u03b1 on VCAM-1 was counteracted by simvastatin and shear stress in an additive dose-response dependent way.", 
    "184": "The therapeutic efficacy of cell-based therapy after stroke can be enhanced by making the host brain tissue more receptive to the administered cells, which thereby facilitates brain plasticity. We hypothesized that simvastatin increases human umbilical cord blood cell (HUCBC) migration into the ischemic brain and promotes brain plasticity and neurological functional outcome after stroke. Rats were subjected to 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and administered subtherapeutic doses of simvastatin (0.5 mg/kg, gavaged daily for 7 days), HUCBCs (1 \u00d7 10(6), one time injection via tail vein), or combination simvastatin with HUCBCs starting at 24 h after stroke. Combination treatment of stroke showed an interactive effect in improvement of neurological outcome compared with simvastatin or HUCBC monotherapy groups. In addition, combination treatment significantly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor/TrkB expression and the number of engrafted HUCBCs in the ischemic brain compared with HUCBC monotherapy. The number of engrafted HUCBCs was significantly correlated with functional outcome (modified neurological severity score). Combination treatment significantly increased neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the ischemic brain, and promoted neuroblast migration in cultured subventricular zone explants. Using primary cultured neurons (PCNs), we found that combination treatment enhanced neurite outgrowth compared with nontreatment control, simvastatin or HUCBC supernatant monotherapy. Inhibition of TrkB significantly attenuated combination treatment-induced neurite outgrowth. Our data indicate that combination simvastatin and HUCBC treatment of stroke increases BDNF/TrkB expression, enhances HUCBC migration into the ischemic brain, amplifies endogenous neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and axonal growth, and thereby improves functional outcome after stroke.",

The LAD anterior and posterior wall thickness and vessel luminal diameter were measured. Blood lipid levels were also assessed at each study visit. All subjects were started on moderate lipid-lowering therapy (40 mg of atorvastatin or simvastatin). There was a sustained decrease in total cholesterol (-23%), triglycerides (-19%), and low-density lipoprotein (-41%) at the 3-month visit from the baseline, with no change in high-density lipoprotein level. Overall, there was no change in the LAD wall thickness and external or vessel lumen diameter over the 12-month period. Of those that demonstrated regression, the only predictor of percentage change in the LAD wall thickness was the baseline LAD wall thickness.",

Since regeneration of alveolar bone is one of the primary aims of periodontal treatment, in the present study we investigated the effects of simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, on primary alveolar osteoblasts (AOBs) and periodontal ligament cells (PDLs) in vitro. The effect of simvastatin (1-100 nM) on the cells proliferation/viability after 24, 48, and 72 h stimulation was measured using 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-assay. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured after stimulation with simvastatin using specific colorimetric assay. Finally, the mRNA expression levels of osteocalcin (OC), receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were measured by real-time PCR. The proliferation/viability of AOBs was significantly decreased by all simvastatin concentrations after 72 h stimulation. The proliferation/viability of PDLs was not influenced by simvastatin. ALP activity of AOBs and PDLs was increased by 1 and 100 nM simvastatin, respectively. Simvastatin induced a dose-dependent increase in OC mRNA expression of AOBs and did not influence that in PDLs. RANKL expression of AOBs was increased at all tested simvastatin concentrations and that in PDLs was increased by higher simvastatin concentrations (10-100 nM). Finally, the expression of OPG in AOBs and PDLs was stimulated by 1-10 and 100 nM simvastatin, respectively. Simvastatin seems to slightly increase the expression of osteogenic markers in AOBs and PDLs, indicating its ability to influence alveolar bone formation and periodontal regeneration.", 
    "199": "Cardiovascular disease is the number one killer in the UK, causing more than 50 000 premature deaths per year, at a cost of over \u00a330 billion to the economy (British Heart Foundation, 2010). Reducing this burden is a priority of the Government and health professionals (Department of Health, 2000). The aim of this paper is to inform and update nurses on four aspects. Firstly, to examine a more accurate test than cholesterol to predict cardiovascular risk that used C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammatory marker, called the Reynold's Risk Score. Use of this score reclassified almost half of women, and one-fifth of men, into lower or higher risk categories, more accurately compared to conventional tools (Ridker et al, 2007; Ridker et al, 2008b). Secondly, to highlight a potential change to the indications for statin-therapy; an indication for those who ordinarily would not receive a statin: healthy middle-aged adults with normal or low cholesterol, but elevated CRP. This includes discussion of the JUPITER trial and its sub-analyses. This large, multicentre, double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial in apparently healthy men over the age of 50 years and women over 60 years, with normal or low cholesterol but elevated CRP, demonstrated significant benefit. Rosuvastatin 20 mg per day compared to a placebo reduced myocardial infarction and stroke by half, and reduced venous thromboembolism by almost half (Ridker et al, 2008a; Glynn et al. 2009; Everett, et al, 2010). Thirdly, to discuss the pleiotropic effects of statins, which include reduction of CRP (Ridker et al, 2008a), increases in endothelial repair cells (Spiel, et al, 2008), alteration of clotting factors (Glynn, et al, 2009), and enhancement of vitamin D metabolism (Yavuz et al, 2009). Fourthly, to discuss evidence that the pleiotropic effects of statins may be attributable to the vitamin D effect. This paper therefore evaluates the evidence suggesting that vitamin D supplementation may attain the same benefit as statins (Grimes, 2006), in addition to reducing statinassociated side-effects when co-administered (Ahmed et al, 2009).", 
    "200": "The 'evidence' in evidence-based medicine (EBM) is often limited to knowledge obtained from randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT). Most RCTs, however, have strict enrollment criteria which make patient background characteristics and clinical histories significantly different from those encountered in actual practice. Thus it is important to accumulate and analyze data obtained in daily practice to gain insight into a larger clinical picture. Recent developments in information technology and its lowered cost have enabled us to record clinical activity in much greater detail at a lower cost. These factors prompted us to design and develop a coronary angiography and intervention reporting system (CAIRS) to collect data and analyze outcomes of coronary intervention. The resulting advanced CAIRS can record detailed data on coronary angiographic and interventional procedures.To date, data on 10,025 cases of coronary angiography, of which 3,574 were interventional, have been collected over a 5.5 year period. There were 4,343 unique patients, 3,115 (71.7%) of which were male. The overall mean age was 67.0 \u00b1 11.5. The mean age of males was 66.3 \u00b1 11.4 and that of females was 69.0 \u00b1 11.4. About one-third of the patients never underwent a PCI procedure at our institution. For patients that underwent at least one PCI procedure at our institution, the prescription rate of statin increased from 50.8% in 2005 to 80.3% in 2011, while those of nitrate and ticlopidine decreased from 36.7% and 90.8% in 2005 to 21.3% and 0.8% in 2011, respectively. We have also implemented the same system at another institution and compared the data on stent usage between the two institutions, which revealed vastly different stent usage profiles.In conclusion, we have successfully developed and implemented an advanced coronary angiography and intervention reporting system which we call CAIRS. Implementing the same system at multiple institutions and analyzing data collected from several institutions will provide detailed and timely insight into the 'real world' of coronary angiography and interventional procedures and their outcome.",

HoFH patients have aggressive cardiovascular disease that develops from birth due to severe LDLR defects, resulting, in turn, in excess production of Apo B-containing atherogenic lipoproteins (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] and lipoprotein(a)). The condition is characterized by exceptionally high LDL cholesterol levels, cutaneous and tendon xanthomas, and valvular and supravalvular stenosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis often manifests in the first 2 decades of life. Treatment typically involves lipid-modifying medical therapy as well as mechanical removal of plasma LDL by means of apheresis. Although statins have afforded survival into the third and fourth decades of life, further therapeutic advancements currently under investigation promise hope of further improvements in survival and improved quality of life. The purpose of this review is to provide current perspectives on diagnosis and therapy in an effort to encourage early recognition and treatment of this rare but severe disease.", 
    "202": "Bariatric surgery is a proven tool in reducing the co-morbidities associated with morbid obesity. The aim of the present review was to assess the current data and discuss the strategies for preoperative evaluation, preoperative treatment, and intraoperative management of the obese patient with cardiac disease seeking bariatric surgery, including those who have undergone previous angiographic intervention with coronary stenting and/or antiplatelet therapy. The setting was a university hospital in the United States.", 
    "203": "A search of the English-language reports using the keywords morbid obesity, bariatric surgery, perioperative risk assessment, coronary artery disease, coronary stents, and antiplatelet therapy was conducted.", 
    "204": "The methods of preoperative cardiac risk assessment found in the published studies included the use of certain criteria, stress echocardiography, and single-photon emission computed tomography. Preoperative medical treatment optimization with \u03b2-blockers and statins is recommended. Perioperative antiplatelet therapy in the form of aspirin 81 mg can be safely continued, but clopidogrel should be stopped and reinitiated with caution.", 
    "205": "Preoperative assessment of morbidly obese patients with coexisting cardiac issues presents unique challenges. Safe patient care and good clinical outcomes can be achieved with adherence to evidence-based practice.", 
    "206": "Health Canada's recent approval of plant sterols as food ingredients to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is believed to be a significant step toward improving Canadians' cardiovascular health and reducing the economic burden of heart disease. When dyslipidemic patients consume plant sterols at a recommended daily dose of 2 g, they can reduce LDL-C by 10% to 15%, with no deleterious effects on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. A 10% LDL-C reduction in response to plant sterol consumption is projected to reduce heart disease risk by 25%. Because they are available without a prescription, plant sterols are an option for dietitians who wish to provide cholesterol-lowering guidance beyond traditional dietary advice (i.e., lowering saturated fat intake and restricting dietary cholesterol). In addition, plant sterols can be used in combination with a statin or when statin use is contraindicated, and they have recently emerged as a potentially valuable triglyceride-lowering option. However, the projected improvement in public health and health care savings will be realized only if impediments to daily use are removed. One such impediment is the higher cost of fortified food products, such as yogurt and margarine. If the cost of plant sterol food products is to decline, cost-effective sources must be investigated and a larger range of foods containing plant sterols must be made available.", 
    "207": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) contributes to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases with multiple properties such as vasoconstriction. Human ET-1 gene expression is up-regulated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) through hypoxia response element (HRE). Although previous studies suggested that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) alter HIF-1-related gene expression, it remained unclear whether statins modulate HIF-1-mediated ET-1 expression. Therefore, we investigated the effect of fluvastatin on hypoxia-induced human ET-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC).", 
    "208": "Hypoxia (1% O(2)), compared with the normoxic condition (21% O(2)), significantly induced the expression of preproET-1 mRNA, ET-1 protein, and ET-1 secretion in VSMC. Hypoxia induced a 2.3-fold increase in HRE-dependent ET-1 reporter gene activation. Under concentrations of 1 \u00b5mol/L or greater, fluvastatin attenuated the hypoxia-induced ET-1 gene expression through the accelerated ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation of HIF-1\u03b1, thus consequently attenuating HIF-1\u03b1 binding to the HRE of the ET-1 gene. These inhibitory effects of fluvastatin were cancelled by concomitant treatment with mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate, or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not squalene.", 
    "209": "The present study suggests that fluvastatin attenuates HIF-1-dependent ET-1 gene expression in conjunction with the stimulation of HIF-1\u03b1 ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation via isoprenoid-dependent mechanisms.", 
    "210": "Endogenous prenylation with sesquiterpene or diterpene isoprenoids facilitates membrane localization and functional activation of small monomeric GTP-binding proteins. A direct effect of isoprenoids on regulation of gene expression and protein stability has also been proposed. In this study, we determined the role of sesquiterpene or diterpene isoprenoids on the regulation of Rho G-protein expression, activation, and stability in human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells. In both primary and transformed human TM cells, limiting endogenous isoprenoid synthesis with lovastatin, a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, elicited marked increases in RhoA and RhoB mRNA and protein content. The effect of lovastatin was dose-dependent with newly synthesized inactive protein accumulating in the cytosol. Supplementation with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) prevented, while inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase-I mimicked, the effects of lovastatin on RhoA and RhoB protein content. Similarly, lovastatin-dependent increases in RhoA and RhoB mRNA expression were mimicked by geranylgeranyl transferase-I inhibition. Interestingly, GGPP supplementation selectively promoted the degradation of newly synthesized Rho proteins which was mediated, in part, through the 20S proteasome. Functionally, GGPP supplementation prevented lovastatin-dependent decreases in actin stress fiber organization while selectively facilitating the subcellular redistribution of accumulated Rho proteins from the cytosol to the membrane and increasing RhoA activation. Post-translational prenylation with geranylgeranyl diterpenes selectively facilitates the expression, membrane translocation, functional activation, and turnover of newly synthesized Rho proteins. Geranylgeranyl prenylation represents a novel mechanism by which active Rho proteins are targeted to the 20S proteasome for degradation in human TM cells.", 
    "211": "Sepsis is an inflammatory condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Given the lack of specific therapies for the condition, prevention has garnered significant interest and increased importance. The article reviews the current literature regarding the use of aspirin and statins for the prevention of sepsis.", 
    "212": "Aspirin and statins have been integral in the prevention of atherosclerotic disease. Additionally, statins have proven beneficial in the prevention of nonatherosclerotic conditions secondary to their pleiotropic effects. In animal models, this pleiotropism modulates many inflammatory pathways of sepsis. The platelet also plays an integral role in this inflammatory cascade of sepsis. Scientific data indicates that antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, may attenuate these undesirable effects of platelets. Finally, observational studies have shown that patients taking statins have a decreased incidence of sepsis and septic shock, and aspirin may potentiate these benefits.", 
    "213": "Sepsis is a deadly and costly condition with no available, specific treatment options. The statins and aspirin are well tolerated and widely used for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Because of their effects on the immune system and inflammatory pathways, they may present viable medical options for the prevention of sepsis.", 
    "214": "Neuroprotection seeks to restrict injury to the brain parenchyma following an ischaemic insult by preventing salvageable neurons from dying. The concept of neuroprotection has shown promise in experimental studies, but has failed to translate into clinical success. Many reasons exist for this including the heterogeneity of human stroke and the lack of methodological agreement between preclinical and clinical studies. Even with the proposed Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable criteria for preclinical development of neuroprotective agents for stroke, we have still seen limited success in the clinic, an example being NXY-059, which fulfilled nearly all the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable criteria. There are currently a number of ongoing trials for neuroprotective strategies including hypothermia and albumin, but the outcome of these approaches remains to be seen. Combination therapies with thrombolysis also need to be fully investigated, as restoration of oxygen and glucose will always be the best therapy to protect against cell death from stroke. There are also a number of promising neuroprotectants in preclinical development including haematopoietic growth factors, and inhibitors of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases, a source of free radical production which is a key step in the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke. For these neuroprotectants to succeed, essential quality standards need to be adhered to; however, these must remain realistic as the evidence that standardization of procedures improves translational success remains absent for stroke.", 
    "215": "Members of the human SLC superfamily such as organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), OATP1B3, and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) are drug uptake transporters that are localised on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes mediating the uptake of drugs such as atorvastatin and metformin into hepatocytes. Ingredients of food such as flavonoids influence the effects of drugs, e.g. by inhibition of drug transporters. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the Ginkgo biloba flavonoids apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin, and the grapefruit flavonoids naringenin, naringin, and rutin on the OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT1 transport activity. Transporter expressing HEK293 cell lines were used with [3H]sulfobromophthalein ([3H]BSP) as substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, [3H]atorvastatin as substrate for OATP1B1, and [3H]1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ([3H]MPP(+)) as substrate for OCT1. The G. biloba flavonoids showed a competitive inhibition of the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated [3H]BSP and the OATP1B1-mediated [3H]atorvastatin uptake. Quercetin was the most potent inhibitor of the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated [3H]BSP transport with K(i)-values of 8.8\u00b10.8\u03bcM and 7.8\u00b11.7\u03bcM, respectively. For the inhibition of the OATP1B1-mediated [3H]atorvastatin transport, apigenin was the most potent inhibitor with a K(i) value of 0.6\u00b10.2\u03bcM. Among the grapefruit flavonoids, naringenin was the most potent inhibitor of the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated [3H]BSP transport with IC(50)-values of 81.6\u00b11.1\u03bcM and 101.1\u00b11.1\u03bcM, respectively. All investigated flavonoids showed no significant inhibition of the OCT1-mediated [3H]MPP(+) uptake. Taken together, these in vitro studies showed that the investigated flavonoids inhibit the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated drug transport, which could be a mechanism for food-drug interactions in humans.", 
    "216": "Statins are among the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. Although their benefits for cardiovascular disease are well established, the effects of statins on depressive symptoms are unknown.", 
    "217": "We examined the association between baseline statin use (2000-2002) and subsequent depressive symptoms in a prospective cohort study of 965 outpatients with coronary disease from 12 outpatient clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area. Depressive symptoms were assessed annually for 6 years using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) (primary outcome measure). We evaluated the cross-sectional association between statin use and risk of depressive symptoms at baseline and the longitudinal association between baseline statin use and risk of depressive symptoms during follow-up.", 
    "218": "Of the 965 participants, 629 (65%) used statins. At baseline, statin users had lower mean \u00b1 SE PHQ depression scores than nonusers (4.8 \u00b1 0.2 vs 5.9 \u00b1 0.3, P < .01). Statin users were less likely than nonusers to have depression (PHQ score \u2265 10) at baseline (17% vs 24%; P = .02) and during follow-up (28% vs 40%; P < .01). Among the 776 patients without depressive symptoms at baseline (PHQ < 10), statin use was associated with a 48% decreased odds of developing depression during follow-up (odds ratio [OR], 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38-0.73; P < .01). After we adjusted for potentially confounding variables, statin use remained associated with a 38% decreased odds of subsequent depression (adjusted OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.95; P = .02).", 
    "219": "We found that statin use was associated with a decreased risk of subsequent depressive symptoms in patients with coronary heart disease. Whether use of statins prevents depressive symptoms deserves further study.", 
    "220": "In recent years, diabetes and its associated complications have come to represent a major public health concern. It is a complex disease characterized by multiple metabolic derangements and is known to impair cardiac function by disrupting the balance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants at the cellular level. The subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and accompanying oxidative stress are hallmarks of the molecular mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular disease. Among several oxidative stress-mediated mechanisms that have been proposed, ROS-mediated oxidative stress has received the most attention. ROS have been shown to interact with proteins, lipids, and DNA, causing damage to the cellular macromolecules and subsequently, deterioration of cellular function. Induction of thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) gene expression has been demonstrated to protect the diabetic myocardium from dysfunction by reducing oxidative stress and enhancing the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The failure of antioxidants to consistently demonstrate clinical benefit necessitates further investigation of the role of oxidative stress in diabetes-mediated cardiovascular disease.", 
    "221": "Five new decalin derivatives (1-5), together with two known compounds (6 and 7), were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of red yeast rice. Their structures were elucidated by means of NMR and mass spectroscopic analyses. Monascusic lactone A (1) is the first reported naturally occurring decalin derivative possessing a spiro lactone at the C-1 position. The immunosuppressive effects of all these isolates (1-7) on human T cell proliferation were investigated, and all, especially monascusic acids B (2), C (3), D (4), and A (6) and heptaketide (7), suppressed human T cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner from 10 to 100 \u03bcM. This is the first report on the immunosuppressive activity of decalin derivatives.", 
    "222": "The aim of this study was to improve the solubility, stability and bioavailability of amorphous atorvastatin calcium (AT) by complexing it with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin. The formation of the inclusion complexation was identified by molecular modeling, phase solubility diagrams, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffractometry. Orally Disintegrating Tablets (ODT) were then manufactured by direct compression. Apart from improved stability compared to pure AT, disintegration time of 27s, hardness of 5 kg and favorable mouth feel were achieved. In vitro dissolution tests of the ODT of AT inclusion complex exhibited higher dissolution rates than those with pure drug and the commercial tablet Lipitor. In vivo bioavailability studies in rats also showed shorter T(max), higher C(max) and increased AUC of 4.42 and 1.86 fold compared to the plain drug ODT and Lipitor. These results strongly suggest to use HP-beta-CD to improve the physicochemical characteristics and bioavailability of AT.",

These people were then matched by year of birth and sex with 1.6\u00a0million people in the U.S. database. From this matched pool, we estimated that 280,000 people aged 55-64\u00a0years from each country in 2005 were prescribed at least one drug. Of these, 91,474 (33%) in the U.S. were prescribed a statin compared with 68,217 (24%) in the U.K. After excluding those who did not receive statins continuously or who switched statins during the year, there remained 61,470 in the U.S. and 45,788 in the U.K. who were prescribed a single statin preparation continuously during 2005 (annual statin users). We estimated and compared drug costs (presented in 2005 U.S. dollars) separately in the two countries.", 
    "228": "Estimated drug costs were determined by random sampling. Estimated annual costs/patient in the U.S. ranged from $313 for generic lovastatin to $1428 for nongeneric simvastatin. In the U.K., annual costs/patient ranged from $164 for generic simvastatin to $509 for nongeneric atorvastatin. The total annual cost of the continuous receipt of statins in the U.S. was $64.9\u00a0million compared with $15.7\u00a0million in the U.K. In June 2006, after our study results were analyzed, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved generic simvastatin. We thus derived cost estimates for simvastatin use during 2006 and found that more than 60% of simvastatin users switched to the generic product, which reduced the cost/pill by more than 50%.", 
    "229": "The cost paid for statins in the U.S. for people younger than 65\u00a0years, who were insured by private companies, was approximately 400% higher than comparable costs paid by the government in the U.K. Available generic statins were substantially less expensive than those that were still under patent in both countries."
