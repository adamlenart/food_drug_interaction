Endogenous adrenomedullin (AM) induces anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and proangiogenic effects. We examined the effects of simvastatin on cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis in AM heterozygous knockout (AM(+/-)) mice treated with angiotensin (Ang) II and high salt loading. Seven-week-old AM(+/-) mice were infused with Ang II while on a high-salt diet with or without simvastatin for 2 weeks. Hearts were stained by hematoxylin-eosin or Masson's trichrome, and were immunostained with isolectin B(4) and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin antibodies. Expression of c-Kit and Sca-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) was evaluated by real-time PCR analysis. Apoptotic cells in hearts were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Hearts from Ang II/salt loading AM(+/-) mice showed marked perivascular fibrosis around coronary arteries. Treatment with simvastatin significantly inhibited the fibrosis around coronary arteries in Ang II/salt-loading AM(+/-) mice. Expression of c-Kit and Sca-1 mRNAs in hearts from Ang II/salt-loading AM(+/-) mice was significantly lower than in hearts from wild-type mice. Treatment with simvastatin significantly increased the suppressed expression of c-Kit and Sca-1 mRNAs. In addition, treatment with simvastatin significantly increased the number of isolectin B(4)-positive capillary arteries in hearts from Ang II/salt-loading AM(+/-) mice. Ang II/high salt significantly increased apoptotic cells in hearts from AM(+/-) mice; this trend was reversed by treatment with simvastatin. Thus, statins have potent cardioprotective effects that may be associated with anti-fibrotic, proangiogenic and anti-apoptotic effects in Ang II/salt-loading AM(+/-) mice.", 
    "1": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF), a common complication of cardiac surgery, can increase the morbidity and mortality, as well as the costs of the surgery being preformed. Guidelines recommend the use of \u03b2-blockers, amiodarone, or sotalol to decrease the risk of experiencing POAF. However, none of these agents fully protect the patient from POAF, thus newer agents are needed to be used in combination with them. Many different agents have been studied to fit this role and may be grouped into 2 categories: agents with antiarrhythmic activity such as magnesium and polyunsaturated fatty acids and agents with anti-inflammatory activity such as statins and free radical scavengers. Most of these novel agents have been studied in a wide variety of trials; however, some clearly have more effect than others. Although none of these newer agents have the data required to make blanket recommendations for use at this point, given the safety profile and low costs of some, many continue to be evaluated in randomized-controlled trials.",

Electronic patient database in a university-affiliated hospital in Thailand was used. Based on the utilization of top 5 high drug expenditure in 2005, the prevalence and the financial loss of oversupply (medication possession ratio [MPR] >1.00) were estimated. In total, 1893 patients were included in this study. The average age was 65.2 years and the majority were female (56%). The prevalence of oversupply ranged from 23.2% to 62.8%, whereas the annual financial loss ranged from US $4108 to US $10 517. The total amount of loss was US $32 903 or 3.77% of total medication costs. In summary, because of the high prevalence and associated high financial loss, oversupply of medication is a significant financial burden on hospitals and society.",

In 2007 and over 5 months, 6704 consecutive patients with ACS were enrolled in the Gulf Registry of Acute Coronary Events. Patients were categorized according to Killip classification at presentation (Classes I, II, III, and IV). Patients' characteristics and in-hospital outcomes were analyzed. High Killip classes were defined in 22% of patients. In comparison to Killip Class I, patients with higher Killip class had greater prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, presented late, were less likely to have angina, and were less likely to receive antiplatelet, statins, and \u03b2-blockers. Classes II, III, and IV were associated with higher adjusted odds of death in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-3.69; OR 6.1, 95% CI 3.41-10.86; and OR 28, 95% CI 15.24-54.70, respectively) and non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.24-4.82; OR 3.2,95% 1.49-7.02; and OR 9.8, 95% CI 3.79-25.57, respectively). In conclusion, across ACS, patients with higher Killip class had worse clinical profile and were less likely to be treated with evidence-based therapy. High Killip class was independent predictors of mortality in ST-elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. Physician in the emergency department should be aware of the importance of clinical examination in the risk stratification in patients presenting with ACS.", 
    "12": "Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of death by cancer in the western world. Despite major progress, even new chemotherapeutic regimens have had relatively little impact on long term survival in the approximately 50% of patients with advanced disease at presentation meaning that prevention is the only realistic way to reduce the burden of this disease. Many countries have implemented population-based screening methods to prevent colorectal cancer by the physical removal of its precursor lesion the adenoma, or to detect cancer at an earlier stage when it is amenable to surgical cure. However these programs have only been shown to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 30% in those screened and therefore new or complimentary approaches are needed. One such approach is chemoprevention. A number of compounds have shown potential in reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer. Most widely known are NSAIDs but recently inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, also known as statins, commonly prescribed medications that lower serum cholesterol, have been shown to reduce colorectal cancer incidence. A critical issue in chemoprevention is the weighing of benefits against risks. In chemoprevention this balance is likely to be unfavourable when used in a wide unselected population even for the safest of compounds. Therapy should therefore be tailored to the individual patient. The balance will be more favourable in high risk groups such as individuals especially susceptible to neoplasia because of environmental risk factors, patients with inflammatory bowel disease, those with a hereditary predisposition and patients with a previous history of colorectal cancer or polyps. Furthermore colorectal cancer is not one disease but a heterogeneous group of diseases with different underlying molecular mechanisms. It is likely that both prevention and therapy will need to be tailored to the molecular subtype of the cancer in question. This may explain why studies of colorectal cancer in statin users do not show consistent protective effects. Evidence in vitro has shown a dichotomous effect of statins with either a cancer inhibiting or cancer promoting effect depending on their molecular subtype. Further studies are needed to determine in which patient groups statins can be used to prevent colorectal cancer and whether in other patients groups they should be avoided.", 
    "13": "Reduction of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol through statin therapy has only modestly decreased coronary heart disease (CHD)-associated mortality in developed countries, which has prompted the search for alternative therapeutic strategies for CHD. Major efforts are now focused on therapies that augment high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mediated reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), and ultimately increase the fecal disposal of cholesterol. The process of RCT has long been thought to simply involve HDL-mediated delivery of peripheral cholesterol to the liver for biliary excretion out of the body. However, recent studies have revealed a novel pathway for RCT that does not rely on biliary secretion. This non-biliary pathway rather involves the direct excretion of cholesterol by the proximal small intestine. Compared to RCT therapies that augment biliary sterol loss, modulation of non-biliary fecal sterol loss through the intestine is a much more attractive therapeutic strategy, given that excessive biliary cholesterol secretion can promote gallstone formation. However, we are at an early stage in understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating the non-biliary pathway for RCT, and much additional work is required in order to effectively target this pathway for CHD prevention. The purpose of this review is to discuss our current understanding of biliary and non-biliary contributions to RCT with particular emphasis on the possibility of targeting the intestine as an inducible cholesterol secretory organ.",

Approaches to the prevention of postoperative AKI include careful risk stratification of patients, allowing adequate recovery following a prior AKI, consideration of less extensive surgical procedures, avoidance of cardiopulmonary bypass, minimizing injury from radiocontrast dyes or other nephrotoxic agents, and optimizing cardiovascular function and oxygen delivery. Early identification of AKI and prompt, judicious application of RRT may also improve outcomes.

Decreased utilization of omeprazole and simvastatin, alongside increased utilization of esomeprazole, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, was seen in countries with limited demand-side measures to counteract commercial pressures. Prescribing restrictions, or a combination of education, prescribing targets and financial incentives, had the greatest influence on enhancing the utilization of omeprazole and simvastatin. For example, there was a threefold reduction in the utilization of atorvastatin in Austria following prescribing restrictions. Multiple demand-side interventions generally had a greater influence than single interventions, with the impact appearing additive. Multiple interventions coupled with initiatives to lower prices of generics considerably enhanced prescribing efficiency.",

Femoral artery blood flow (FBF), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and femoral vascular conductance (FVC, calculated as the quotient of FBF and MAP) were measured at rest and during 5 min of single knee-extensor exercise at ~10 W workload in healthy men (n = 31) and women (n = 32) (age 40-72 years). Age, menopausal status, maximal quadriceps strength, blood lipids, vitamin D levels, maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), physical activity, blood pressure, estimated quadriceps muscle mass, and body mass index (BMI) were also assessed. The effect of age on FBF and FVC was negative and significant in men (r = -0.44 and -0.42 and p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively) but was abolished by normalization to estimated quadriceps muscle (p = 0.18 and 0.73, respectively). There was no effect of age on leg hemodynamic responses to exercise in women (alone or normalized to quadriceps muscle), but menopausal status was a significant predictor of FVC and normalized FVC (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). The multivariate model for exercising FVC in men (in order of strongest to weakest predictors) included quadriceps strength, BMI, resting FVC, age, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The multivariate model for exercising FVC in women included quadriceps mass, systolic blood pressure, vitamin D, age, VO(2max), waist circumference, and physical activity score.

    "43": "We have recently described that in an experimental model of atherosclerosis and in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) statins increased the activation of the Smad pathway by transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), leading to an increase in TGF-\u03b2-dependent matrix accumulation and plaque stabilization. Angiotensin II (AngII) activates the Smad pathway and contributes to vascular fibrosis, although the in vivo contribution of TGF-\u03b2 has not been completely elucidated. Our aim was to further investigate the mechanisms involved in AngII-induced Smad activation in the vasculature, and to clarify the beneficial effects of statins on AngII-induced vascular fibrosis. Infusion of AngII into rats for 3 days activates the Smad pathway and increases fibrotic-related factors, independently of TGF-\u03b2, in rat aorta. Treatment with atorvastatin or simvastatin inhibited AngII-induced Smad activation and related-fibrosis. In cultured rat VSMCs, direct AngII/Smad pathway activation was mediated by p38 MAPK and ROCK activation. Preincubation of VSMCs with statins inhibited AngII-induced Smad activation at all time points studied (from 20 minutes to 24 hours). All these data show that statins inhibited several AngII-activated intracellular signaling systems, including p38-MAPK and ROCK, which regulates the AngII/Smad pathway and related profibrotic factors and matrix proteins, independently of TGF-\u03b2 responses. The inhibitory effect of statins on the AngII/Smad pathway could explain, at least in part, their beneficial effects on hypertension-induced vascular damage.",

A simple therapeutic approach involving discontinuation of beta-blockers remarkably alleviated the symptoms such as left ventricular ejection fraction, and improved the chest radiography and laboratory findings; further, atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm.

In contrast, mucosal T lymphocyte and neutrophilic granulocyte numbers in treated mice were reduced. In addition, levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in ileum, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen were increased whereas pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-23p19, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, MCP-1) was found to be significantly lower in the ileum of treated animals as compared to Placebo controls. Furthermore, treated animals displayed not only fewer pro-inflammatory enterobacteria and enterococci but also higher anti-inflammatory lactobacilli and bifidobacteria loads.

Diffuse sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture surgery (CLP) in male Wistar rats. Serum glucose and inflammatory cytokines levels were assessed 24 h after CLP. The effect of atorvastatin on survival of septic animals was investigated in parallel with insulin signaling and its modulators in liver, muscle and adipose tissue. Atorvastatin improves survival in septic rats and this improvement is accompanied by a marked improvement in insulin sensitivity, characterized by an increase in glucose disappearance rate during the insulin tolerance test. Sepsis induced an increase in the expression/activation of TLR4 and its downstream signaling JNK and IKK/NF-\u03baB activation, and blunted insulin-induced insulin signaling in liver, muscle and adipose tissue; atorvastatin reversed all these alterations in parallel with a decrease in circulating levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. In summary, this study demonstrates that atorvastatin treatment increased survival, with a significant effect upon insulin sensitivity, improving insulin signaling in peripheral tissues of rats during peritoneal-induced sepsis. The effect of atorvastatin on the suppression of the TLR-dependent inflammatory pathway may play a central role in regulation of insulin signaling and survival in sepsis insult.",

Risk prediction models are being constructed based upon (1) clinical contributors, (2) known molecular determinants and (3) the genetic architecture underlying HDL cholesterol levels. To date, however, no single resource has combined these factors within the context of a practice-based data set.

    "52": "Of the 36 eligible trials, 14 dose-ranging trials were used in model development and 22 one-dose trials were used for model prediction. The dose-response of rosuvastatin was successfully described by a simple E(max) model with a fixed E(0), which provided a common E(max) and an approximate twofold difference in ED(50) for Westerners and Asians. The PPD model was demonstrated to be stable and predictive.", 
    "53": "The race differences in the pharmacodynamics of rosuvastatin are consistent with those observed in the pharmacokinetics of the drug, confirming that there is no significant difference in the exposure-response relationship for LDL-C reduction between Westerners and Asians. The study suggests that for a new compound with a mechanism of action similar to that of rosuvastatin, its efficacy in Western populations plus its pharmacokinetics in bridging studies in Asian populations may be used to support a registration of the new compound in Asian countries.",

    "55": "In addition to risk reduction, statins may also improve stroke outcome, even when administered after the event. Due to the multitargeted vasoprotective effects of statins, statins may be beneficial in various conditions and disorders in which acute and chronic endothelial dysfunction play a key role. Vice-versa, abrupt interruption of statin therapy following acute cerebrovascular or cardiovascular events may impede vascular function and increase morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, statins could serve as an adjuvant for enhancing the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy and other promising neuroprotective compounds, as it stabilizes endothelial function and additionally exerts profibrinolytic, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant effects. However, so far, there are only limited clinical data on the effect of statin therapy on stroke outcome.",

Almost one-third of TIA patients wait more than 24 h before presenting to medical attention, with delay associated with higher stroke risk. Risk stratification following suspected TIA may be performed by clinical assessment of individual patient characteristics, combined with the validated ABCD2 score (pre-investigation), and the ABCD3-I score (postinvestigation) in secondary care settings. Brain MRI and transcranial Doppler ultrasound add information related to vascular territory, TIA mechanism, and prognosis. Variability in systolic blood pressure in treated and untreated patients is an important predictor of stroke risk, independently of mean blood pressure.",

    "60": "There is accumulating evidence that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) play a role in the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We have previously found that atorvastatin treatment significantly reduces serum levels of AGEs in type 2 diabetic patients and subjects with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in a cholesterol lowering-independent manner. In this study, we examined whether atorvastatin could reduce proteinuria partly via reduction of serum levels of AGEs in non-diabetic CKD patients. Ten non-diabetic normotensive stage I or II CKD patients with dyslipidemia were enrolled. Patients were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/day) for 1 year. All subjects underwent determination of blood chemistries, proteinuria and serum levels of AGEs at baseline and after 1 year. Atorvastatin treatment for 1 year significantly decreased circulating levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and AGEs, while it increased HDL-cholesterol levels. Further, although atorvastatin treatment did not affect estimated glomerular filtration rate, it significantly reduced proteinuria. In univariate analyses, proteinuria levels were correlated with total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol (inversely) and AGEs. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that AGE level was a sole independent correlate of proteinuria. In this initial examination of the patients in this study, our present study suggests that atorvastatin could decrease proteinuria in non-diabetic CKD patients with dyslipidemia partly via reduction of serum levels of AGEs. Atorvastatin may have AGE-lowering effects in CKD patients as well that could contribute to renoprotective properties of this agent.",

Even among those with LDL>130 mg/dL, 50% or less received LLT. Predictors of LLT at discharge included LLT before admission, hyperlipidemia, prior coronary artery disease, increasing body mass index, and in-hospital percutaneous coronary intervention. Although there was some temporal improvement in the rate of LLT from 2005 to 2007, a decline in use of LLT was noted in 2008 and 2009. This was attributed to a sharp reduction in use of ezetimibe in combination with statin, without corresponding increases in intensive statin monotherapy.",

Drug-dendrimers complexes were investigated for solubility studies, dissolution studies, in vitro drug release studies, and for stability studies. The solubility enhancement was found maximum with PEGylated dendrimers (33 times) followed by amine (23 times) and hydroxyl (17.5 times) dendrimers. The solubility profile of simvastatin-dendrimer complex showed a linear correlation (Higuchi A(L)-type diagram) between solubility and dendrimers concentration. The formation of the complexes between drug molecules and dendrimers were characterized by the FTIR spectra of these complexes, showing the appearance of the bond formed between the functional groups of the drug (OH and COOH) and dendrimers (NH(2) and OH). The drug-dendrimer complexes displayed the controlled release action during in vitro release studies. Pure simvastatin (SMV) was released in 5h whereas the PEGylated dendrimers-SMV complexes released the drug up to 5 days. The non-PEGylated formulations released the drug up to 24h. Formulations with amine and PEGylated dendrimers were subjected to accelerated stability studies. Formulations with amine dendrimers were found to be most stable in dark, low temperature (0\u00b0C) whereas the dark, RT was most suitable storage conditions for formulation with PEGylated dendrimers.",

In vivo two-photon confocal imaging revealed enhanced mitochondrial depolarization and generation of reactive oxygen species following hepatic I/R in HC-fed but not in CD-fed mice, consistent with decreased mitochondrial GSH (mGSH) observed in HC-fed mice. Moreover, ob/ob mice, characterized by increased hepatic TG, FFA, and cholesterol levels, were as sensitive to I/R-mediated liver injury as mice fed the HC diet. Livers from ob/ob mice displayed increased StAR expression and mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation, resulting in mGSH depletion.

Recent studies have demonstrated that statin treatment can decrease mortality in murine or human sepsis. In the current study mice were anesthetized and subjected to a dorsal 30% TBSA scald burn. Simvastatin or placebo were administered by intraperitoneal injection once daily or every 12h. On post burn day 7 cecal ligation and puncture with a 21-gauge needle (CLP) was performed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, the two different dosing schedules were continued and survival was monitored. In other groups of mice, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in blood were measured in mice at 7 days after injury. A simvastatin dependent improvement in survival was observed in the burn sepsis model. This protection was found to be dose and time dependent. In addition, statin treatment reduced the elevation in IL-6 levels of mice burned 7 days previously. However, IL-6 levels in burned mice with or without statin treatment were elevated by CLP to the same degree. The results of these studies suggest that statin treatment reduces mortality in mice with burns and CLP and that this effect may not be mediated via IL-6 levels.",

The replication origin was isolated from the endogenous plasmid of strain DSM 43082 and the acetone-inducible promoter was determined by analysis of the upstream region of an acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene homologue in strain NBRC 12743. P. autotrophica strains transformed with pTAOR4-P450, carrying a gene for cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, expressed P450 from the acetone-inducible promoter, as verified by SDS-PAGE and spectral analysis. The biotransformation test of acetone-induced resting cells prepared from a strain of P. autotrophica carrying pTAOR4 that harbors a compactin (CP)-hydroxylating P450 gene revealed 3.3-fold increased production of pravastatin (PV), a drug for hypercholesterolemia. Biotransformation of CP by the same strain in batch culture yielded PV accumulation of 14.3 g/l after 100 h.

For years it was considered to be a passive wear and tear process but now it is recognized as an active process similar to atherosclerosis with involvement of several mediators, such as adhesion molecules, TGFs, cathepsin enzymes and bone regulatory proteins. As conviction grew that aortic stenosis has a genesis similar to atherosclerosis, the hypothesis that statins might be able to alter the progression of the disease also grew. Various retrospective studies confirmed the benefits of statin use at an earlier stage of the disease, but some disappointing results were demonstrated by randomized clinical trials.",

Meta-analysis of several large-scale, randomized clinical trials has demonstrated statins to be efficacious in significantly reducing CVD-associated mortality in both primary and secondary prevention. Despite their proven efficacy, statins have also gained attention with respect to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of muscle myopathy, derangements in hepatic function and even ADRs classified as psychiatric in nature. The depletion of cholesterol within the myocyte cell wall and/or the depletion of key intermediates within the cholesterol synthesis pathway are hypothesized as possible mechanisms of statin-associated ADRs. However, pharmacogenetic variability may also be a risk factor for ADRs and can include, for example, enzymes, transporters, cell membrane receptors, intracellular receptors or components of ion channels that contribute to the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of response to a particular drug. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymatic pathways that comprise the polymorphic genes, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, and also a hepatic transporter, solute carrier organic anion transporter (SLCO1B1), which is a single nucleotide polymorphism discovered to be associated with statin-induced myopathy through a genome-wide association study, are discussed with respect to their effect on altering the pharmacokinetic profile of statin metabolism. Variants of the Apolipoprotein E (APO-E) gene, polymorphisms in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene, the HMG-CoA reductase gene and other proteins are discussed with respect to altering the pharmacodynamic profile of statins. Pharmacogenetics and its application in medicine to individualize drug therapy has been previously shown to be clinically and economically beneficial through quality-adjusted life-year assessment. Therefore, polymorphisms affecting the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of statins, which are widely used in therapy, with their potential application in the personalized prescribing of statin therapy, need further research. In this review, we update the recent literature with respect to genetic polymorphisms that may influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statin therapy, and consider the relevance of these findings to the efficacy of treatment, prevention of ADRs and what this may mean for patient tolerance and compliance.",

The clinical symptoms of statin myopathy include myalgia or muscle weakness, tiredness, cramps and/or creatinkinase activity increases (CK). Because hypercholesterolaemia is usually asymptomatic, any unwanted effect of drug used for its management can undermine adherence.

They are used in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients deemed to be at increased risk and their benefit in patients with ischaemic heart disease is well supported. Their use in patients with heart failure (HF) however, is controversial. Evidence from observational and mechanistic studies suggests that statins should benefit patients with HF. However, larger randomised controlled trials have failed to demonstrate these expected benefits.

We sought to understand the molecular mechanisms by which statins could exert anti-platelet actions under physiologic whole blood flow conditions. Using an in vitro perfusion chamber system, we examined the anti-platelet effects of pravastatin under whole blood flow conditions with high or low shear rates. We determined that pravastatin significantly suppressed platelet activation-dependent procoagulant activity, decreasing P-selectin membrane expression, tissue factor accumulation, and thrombin binding within platelet thrombi generated on a von Willebrand factor-surface under high shear rate conditions. These effects resulted in reductions of intra-thrombus fibrin deposition. These antithrombotic properties of pravastatin, which were comparable to those of atorvastatin, could be abrogated by mevalonate. Our experimental approach revealed a novel mechanism mediating the anti-platelet action of statins.

However, despite widespread use of statin therapy, residual cardiovascular risk remains, and this has left clinicians searching for an effective adjunctive therapy to optimize lipid profiles and reduce risk further. Given the cost and duration of large event driven trials, adjunctive lipid lowering therapy options have largely been evaluated through surrogate measures of atherosclerosis, making clinical practice decisions regarding combination therapy difficult. Two common approaches that have been evaluated almost entirely by surrogate outcome trials include the addition of ezetimibe or the addition of niacin. Our article attempts to place these surrogate end point trials in their proper context, providing clinicians with a practical approach to making clinical practice decisions regarding adjunctive therapy in the absence of clinical outcomes data. Although definitive changes to lipid lowering guidelines should be based on clinical outcomes trials, in the absence of clinical outcomes data, it is reasonable to make individualized clinical practice decisions on the basis of surrogate measures of disease as long as there is corroboration among the effect on atherosclerosis and lipid parameters as adjunctive therapy, and clinical outcomes as monotherapy. Given that niacin fits these criteria, it seems prudent to support the use of niacin as adjunctive therapy in combination with maximally tolerated dose of statin in patients with low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and known coronary artery disease. Three ongoing clinical outcomes trials evaluating niacin and ezetimibe in combination with statin will provide more definitive word regarding the safety and efficacy of these agents as adjunctive therapy.",

The cause of nosebleeds can generally be divided into two categories, local and systemic factors, although it should be remembered that a significant number of nosebleeds occur with no obvious cause. Actually, according to the common observation the epistaxis prone subject is an elderly with hypertension associated to some degree of vascular alteration. The statins essentially exert a competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3 methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase that results in cholesterol synthesis inhibition. In the last years, however, there has been a growing evidence that these drugs exert a number of vascular actions that are independent of lipid lowering and result in a vasoprotective effect. Due to their favourable influence on the vascular wall, and the consequent possible modulatory effect on blood pressure, a possible utility of statins in preventing many cases of nosebleed is hypothesized, to our knowledge for the first time.",

Moreover, endothelial dysfunction is an early event in atherosclerosis and is known to be associated with postprandial hypertriglyceridemia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a statin might have an effect on postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, and thereby on endothelial function in obese subjects. Twenty-four obese male subjects were recruited for this study. They were randomly assigned to receive pitavastatin (2 mg/day) or placebo for 2 weeks. The oral fat loading test using OFTT cream was performed pre- and post-treatment, in which the lipid profile and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were assessed before and 4 h after an oral fat load. In the oral fat loading test conducted pretreatment, the oral fat load induced a marked increase of the serum triglyceride (TG) level and decrease in FMD in the pitavastatin and placebo group. In the test conducted post-treatment, the increase in postprandial TG was attenuated (+183 vs. +81 mg/dL, P < 0.001) and decrease in postprandial FMD was completely abolished (-1.1 vs. +0.1%, P < 0.01) by pitavastatin treatment. Moreover, there was a good correlation between the change in postprandial TG and the change in postprandial FMD after the 2 weeks of treatment (r = -0.737, P < 0.001). Pitavastatin might prevent endothelial dysfunction caused by postprandial hypertriglyceridemia within 2 weeks of therapy in obese subjects.",

    "130": "Excessive adventitial neovascularization is one of the hallmarks of atherosclerotic plaque progression and is associated with an increased plaque burden by facilitating leukocyte influx and perivascular inflammation. Statins act atheroprotective by reducing plasma cholesterol levels and by quenching inflammation, but recent studies suggest that they may also affect neovascularization. In this study, we aimed to investigate this notion in apoE(-/-) mice. Advanced carotid artery lesions were induced by perivascular collar placement in mice on western type diet or diet supplemented with atorvastatin (0.003%, w/w). Atorvastatin treatment did not affect diet induced body weight gain and did not lower plasma total cholesterol levels. Plaque size at 8 weeks after collar placement was significantly reduced in atorvastatin treated mice compared to control mice, while also necrotic core size was significantly lower in atorvastatin treated mice. Interestingly, atorvastatin treatment reduced the number of perivascular CD31(+) neovessels by almost 40%. Furthermore, endothelial proliferation was significantly inhibited by atorvastatin treatment in vitro. In conclusion, atorvastatin treatment inhibits plaque development in ApoE deficient mice independent of plasma total cholesterol levels. Given the profound inhibition of adventitial neovascularization, we propose that statins may partly exert their protective effects by modulating this process, identifying yet another atheroprotective mechanism for statins.",

Furthermore, endothelium from LOX-1(-/-) mice failed to demonstrate the diet-dependent reduction in NO and increase in ROS that were observed in WT mice. OxLDL induced Rho translocation to the membrane and Rho activation, and these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with JTX92 or statins. Transfection with siRNA for RhoA, or inhibition of ROCK both decreased OxLDL-stimulated arginase II activation. Preincubation with simvastatin or lovastatin blocked OxLDL-induced dissociation of arginase II from microtubules and prevented microtubule depolymerization.",

    "134": "Reciprocal relationships between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance suggest that therapies improving endothelial dysfunction will simultaneously improve insulin sensitivity and other metabolic parameters. However, previous studies with some statins either did not alter insulin sensitivity or promoted insulin resistance despite significant improvements in endothelial dysfunction and decreases in circulating pro-inflammatory markers. This may be due to pleiotropic or off-target effects of some statins to cause insulin resistance by diverse mechanisms unrelated to endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, there is evidence of other differential metabolic actions of distinct statins including effects on hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition, isoprotenoid synthesis, calcium release, glucose transport, insulin secretion, and/or insulin resistance. Pravastatin increases expression of adiponectin mRNA, enhances adiponectin secretion, increases plasma levels of adiponectin, and enhances insulin sensitivity in mice and humans. Clinical studies including large scale randomized controlled trials demonstrate potential differences between individual statins, with pravastatin promoting risk reduction for new onset of diabetes. Conversely, other statins including atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin all promote significant increase in this risk. Given the frequent concordance of metabolic diseases including diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome with cardiovascular diseases associated with hyperlipidemia, it is important to understand the potential metabolic risks and benefits of therapies with distinct statins. In this review, we discuss these differential effects of statins on metabolic homeostasis and insulin sensitivity.",

These studies compared high-dose treatment (atorvastatin 80 mg/day) to moderate-dose treatment (atorvastatin 10 mg/day in TNT and simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day in IDEAL) in patients with established coronary heart disease. The primary end point of this pooled analysis was major cardiovascular events, a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. At baseline 4,196 patients had never smoked, 11,513 were ex-smokers, and 3,176 were current smokers. The adjusted hazard ratio for current smokers compared to never smokers was 1.68 (95% confidence interval 1.46 to 1.94) and that for current smokers compared to ex-smokers was 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.41 to 1.76). Event rates for current smokers compared to ex-smokers were similarly increased in each treatment group. The difference in absolute event rates between current and ex-smokers in this pooled analysis was 4.5%, which is >2 times as large as the decrease in absolute event rates between high-dose and moderate-dose statin therapy found in the IDEAL (1.7%) and TNT (2.2%) trials, respectively.

At its worst, pellagra manifests as one of the most striking examples of systemic photosensitivity. This is the only photosensitivity syndrome where death is included as a cardinal clinical feature (the often quoted four 'Ds': dermatitis, diarrhoea, dementia and death). However, the pathogenetic mechanism for the photosensitivity caused by niacin deficiency has yet to be determined. This review seeks to update the classification and phenotypic characterization of the various forms of niacin-deficient photosensitivity. Previous speculation about possible mechanisms for the pathogenesis of photosensitivity due to niacin deficiency is reviewed in the context of advances in the understanding of the photochemical basis of photosensitivity reactions. The review concludes by highlighting research required to advance the understanding of this photosensitivity syndrome.", 
    "154": "Several studies over the last years have demonstrated that statins exhibit actions beyond that of lipid-lowering (pleiotropic effects) ranging from improving endothelial function, modulating the inflammatory response, maintaining plaque stability and preventing thrombus formation. Since the interplay among platelets, cells and other components of atherosclerotic lesions as well as the coagulation system play an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis and in the development of acute coronary syndromes, these non-lipid properties of statins may help to explain the early and significant reduction of cardiovascular events reported in several clinical trials of statin therapy. This review focuses on the experimental and clinical results regarding the antiplatelet/antithrombotic effects of statins.", 
    "155": "The role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the development of vascular disease is controversial. Insulin resistance (IR) is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is associated with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection. Thus, IR may promote atherosclerosis and vascular disease in CHC patients. HCV-associated IR may also cause hepatic steatosis and resistance to antiviral treatment. In addition, HCV may impose direct, proatherogenetic action in the vascular wall. This review will elaborate the impact of IR on interferon-\u03b1 based therapy of HCV infection and the role of insulin-sensitizing agents on the response to antiviral treatment and prevention of IR complications, including vascular disease.", 
    "156": "The purpose of the present investigation was to develop solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of simvastatin in order to enhance its oral bioavailability by minimizing its first-pass metabolism. To achieve our goal, SLNs were prepared by solvent injection technique and optimized by 2(3) full factorial experimental design using Design Expert software. The SLN formulations were optimized for amount of compritol, concentration of poloxamer, and volume of acetone in order to achieve desired responses of particle size, entrapment efficiency (EE), and cumulative drug release (CDR). Response surface plots were constructed to study the influence of each variable on each response and the interactions between any two variables were also analyzed. Formulation F(10) with particle size of 271.18\u2009nm, % EE of 68.16% and % CDR of 76.23%, and highest desirability value of 0.645 was selected as optimized formulation. The optimized formulation was evaluated for biodistribution and pharmacokinetics by technetium-99m (Tc-99m) radiolabeling technique in mice. The relative bioavailability of simvastatin from optimized SLNs was found to be 220%, substantiating the protective action of SLNs against liver metabolism. However, though the drug initially bypassed the liver metabolism, simvastatin continuously entered in liver to exert its therapeutic action that was evidenced by biodistribution study.", 
    "157": "In the United States, coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease account for nearly 40% of all deaths each year. Coronary heart disease continues to be the leading cause of mortality and a significant cause of morbidity among North Americans. In 2006, coronary heart disease claimed 607 000 lives, translating into about 1 out of every 5 deaths in the United States. High levels of cholesterol, or hypercholesterolemia, are an important risk factor for coronary heart disease. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, are the most effective class of drugs for lowering serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. They are first-line agents for patients who require drug therapy to reduce serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The purpose of this review is to compare the benefits and harms of different statins in adults and children with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "158": "Pitavastatin was first developed in Japan and is expanding the regions in which it is clinically available. A considerable number of clinical studies have been conducted and published to date on the usefulness of pitavastatin for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or combined dyslipidemia. Pitavastatin demonstrates potent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction at low doses of 1-4 mg/day. It also affects the regression of coronary plaques, as observed in intravascular ultrasound-guided percutaneous coronary intervention studies. Moreover, the persistent, long-term high-density lipoprotein cholesterol elevation observed in the populations treated with pitavastatin is worthy of further attention. The reported improvements in lipid profiles are consistent among the studies conducted in Japan, Korea, Thailand, and Europe. In light of accumulating clinical experience worldwide, pitavastatin is now expected to establish its position for preventing and treating cardiovascular disease.", 
    "159": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the foremost cause of death and disability in the Western world, and it is rapidly becoming so in the developing nations. Even though the use of statin therapy aiming at the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) has significantly reduced cardiovascular events and mortality, substantial residual cardiac events still occur in those being treated to the currently recommended targets. In fact, residual risk is also seen in those who are treated \"aggressively\" such as the \"high risk\" patients so defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). Consequently, one must look for the predictors of risk beyond LDL reduction. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) is the next frontier. The protectiveness of elevated HDL against atherosclerosis is well described in the literature. HDL subdues several atherogenic processes, such as oxidation, inflammation, cell proliferation and thrombosis. It also helps mobilize the excess LDL via reverse cholesterol transport. Low levels of HDL have been shown to be independent predictors of risk. Thus, therapies to raise the HDL hold promise for additional cardiac risk reduction. In this regard, several randomized trials have recently tested this hypothesis, especially in patients at high risk. In addition to the use of aggressive lifestyle modification, clinical outcomes have been measured following augmentation of HDL levels with various treatment modalities, including aggressive statin therapy, combination therapy with fibrates and niacin, and direct HDL-raising drug treatments. These data for low HDL as an independent risk factor and as the new treatment target are reviewed in this paper.", 
    "160": "High-dose potent statin therapy in combination with ezetimibe is now standard practice for the treatment of adult patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH), as the result of numerous studies in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or heFH. These studies have shown the combination to be both effective and safe in the short to medium term. Recently, short-term ezetimibe therapy has also been shown to be effective and safe in combination with statin therapy for children and adolescents with heFH. Effective statin-ezetimibe combination therapy is capable of achieving near-normal lipid profiles in heFH patients, with expected improvement in risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and improved life expectancy resulting predominantly from reduction in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. There are few data to support a pleiotropic action of ezetimibe with regard to CVD benefit, unlike therapy with statins. No serious and unexpected clinical adverse effects of combination statin-ezetimibe therapy have emerged till date, although data are limited in children and adolescents, for whom longer-term studies are required. Recent data suggesting possible proatherogenic effects of ezetimibe require confirmation. One large long-term randomized controlled clinical outcomes trial is in progress in non-FH patients to determine the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe therapy; it is unlikely that such a trial will ever be performed in patients with FH.", 
    "161": "An adverse effect of statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs, is contractile dysfunction of skeletal muscles. We investigated the mechanism underlying this effect in cultured myofibers isolated from rats. Fluvastatin (Flv) for 72 h decreased caffeine- and ionomycin-induced contraction of myofibers and Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Ca(2+)-shortening curves measured in skinned myofibers indicated that myofibrillar Ca(2+) sensitivity was unaffected by Flv. A luciferin-luciferase assay revealed less ATP contents in Flv-treated myofibers. Among mevalonate metabolites, including geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), coenzyme Q9, and coenzyme Q10, only GGPP prevented Flv-induced ATP reduction. A selective Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (GG transferase) inhibitor, perillyl alcohol (POH), and a specific GG transferase-I inhibitor, GGTI-298, both mimicked Flv in decreasing ATP and contraction. Mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased by Flv, and this effect was rescued by GGPP and mimicked by POH and GGTI-298. An endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi traffic inhibitor, brefeldin A, and a Rho inhibitor, membrane permeable exoenzyme C3 transferase, both decreased ATP. We conclude that statin-induced contractile dysfunction is due to reduced Ca(2+) release from SR and reduced ATP levels in myofibers with damaged mitochondria. GGPP depletion and subsequent inactivation of Rab1, possibly along with Rho, may underlie the mitochondrial damage by Flv.", 
    "162": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) is often required, and statin drugs are usually the first-line therapy. However, even when LDL-cholesterol values are within the target range, a substantial residual risk persists. Fibrates may help to lower this risk, especially in patients with high triglyceride and low HDL-cholesterol levels, as suggested by the lipid ACCORD trial. Furthermore, they may even have beneficial effects on the development of microvascular complications such as nephropathy and especially retinopathy, as suggested by the results of the FIELD study. Data suggest benefit with fenofibrate on diabetic retinopathy, with significant effects on the requirement for first laser treatment and macular oedema. Fibrates, like statins, may act directly to decrease the progression of diabetic complications through their lipid-lowering effects, but may also go beyond that via pleiotropic effects. Recent data and the possible underlying mechanisms are analyzed in this review.", 
    "163": "We evaluated the effectiveness of inactivated influenza vaccine in persons aged \u226545 years with co-morbidities (including essential hypertension) likely to have prompted consideration of prophylactic statin therapy. Using case-control analyses, we measured the impact of vaccination on General Practitioner (GP) reported new episodes of illness for clinically diagnosed influenza-like illness (ILI) and total acute respiratory infection (TARI) during eight consecutive winters, adjusting for potential confounders using multivariable techniques. Although the study failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine, we identified important potential confounding related to a greater likelihood of vaccinees than non-vaccinees to consult with a GP for respiratory infections. Future researchers should consider and account for this phenomenon.", 
    "164": "Whilst optimal management of acute coronary syndromes and, in particular, the value of an early invasive strategy including revascularization, is well defined, the treatment of asymptomatic and stable coronary artery disease (CAD) has been more empirical. Recent studies clarify the benefits of different strategies. Strict control of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF), with pharmacological intervention if necessary, remains the cornerstone of CAD management. Systematic screening of asymptomatic patients, even in categories such as those with diabetes, is not recommended. Furthermore, initial revascularization in patients with stable coronary heart disease, and no high risk lesions or disabling angina, has no benefit over medical management of CVRF.", 
    "165": "An 88 years old woman was admitted for muscular pain and weakness. She was under a treatment of simvastatin and was recently prescribed clarithromycin for a lung infection. The diagnosis of statin induced rhabdomyolysis by drug interaction was made. The evolution is good with eviction of the statin and aggressive hydratation. This case shows how important it is to know the risks factors and drug interactions predisposing to statin-induced myopathy.", 
    "166": "the pathophysiology of delayed neurological deficits (DNDs) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is complex, and is not limited to arterial narrowing (vasospasm) and classical ischemia. Thus, combined drug approaches, or therapies with multiple effects, may have the greatest potential for benefit. Statins are known to have pleiotropic vascular effects, some of which may interrupt the pathogenesis of DNDs. Based on promising preliminary reports, many clinicians routinely administer statins to prevent DNDs.", 
    "167": "a systematic review was performed to identify and summarize all animal research, observational studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses which have evaluated the use of statins in the management of SAH.", 
    "168": "nine animal studies, nine observational (cohort and case-control) studies, six RCTs and three meta-analyses were identified. Animal studies have generally administered statin doses that, when adjusted for body weight, are 10-80 times larger than what is used in humans. Nevertheless, these models have consistently reported statins to reduce vasospasm and to demonstrate additional neuroprotective effects. However, observational studies have not revealed an association between statin-use and reduced DNDs or improved neurological outcomes. Results of RCTs have been inconsistent and limited by small sample size, but together suggest that statins may reduce DNDs, with no clear impact on mortality or neurological recovery. Optimal drug administration strategies (timing of initiation, most effective dose and duration) have not been clarified.", 
    "169": "the role of statins in the management of patients with SAH remains unclear. Although promising, statins should not, at this time, be considered standard care.", 
    "170": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely used clinically for their lipid lowering properties. Recent experimental evidence shows that statins are also effective in ameliorating cerebral vasospasm, which occurs as sequelae of subarachnoid hemorrhage. This literature review focuses on the literature-based putative mechanisms involved in statin mediated attenuation of cerebral vasospasm, such as eNOS, vascular inflammation, apoptosis, especially the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway from our experimental study."
