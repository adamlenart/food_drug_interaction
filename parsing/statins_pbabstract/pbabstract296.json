We investigated whether improvement in NO availability in hypercholesterolemia can be achieved rapidly with statins before lipid-lowering therapy is complete.", 
    "1": "We studied 41 patients (52 +/- 11 years) with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or = 130 mg/dL (179 +/- 45 mg/dL) randomly assigned to treatment either with atorvastatin (20 mg/day) or cerivastatin (0.4 mg/day). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the forearm vasculature was measured by plethysmography and intra-arterial infusion of acetylcholine (ACh) after 3 days (n = 18) and 14 days (n = 39) of treatment. NO availability and oxidative stress were assessed by coinfusion of l-NMMA and vitamin C.", 
    "2": "After 3 days of treatment, LDL-cholesterol decreased by 11.9% with a further decrease to 29.6% after 14 days ( P < .001). Endothelium-dependent vasodilation improved by +46.7% after 3 days of statin therapy compared with before therapy (ACh 48 microg/min: +15.7 +/- 10.6 vs +10.7 +/- 10.8 mL/min per 100 mL, P < .05). No further improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation (+42.7% compared with before therapy) could be demonstrated after 14 days of treatment (ACh 48 microg/min: +17.7 +/- 10.3 vs +12.4 +/- 9.3 mL/min per 100 mL before therapy, P < .001). Coinfusion of ACh plus vitamin C was able to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation before but not after 3 or 14 days of statin therapy either. The improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilation after therapy was no longer observed when the NO-synthase inhibitor l-NMMA was coinfused together with ACh.", 
    "3": "Short-term lipid-lowering therapy with statins is able to improve endothelial function and NO availability almost completely after 3 days in hypercholesterolemic patients probably by decreasing oxidative stress. This improvement seems to be more rapid than the accompanying decline in LDL-cholesterol and not related to these lipid changes. This finding can support the concept of lipid-independent effects of statins in humans.", 
    "4": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) increase endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, although the precise mechanism of this statin induced increase in NO production remains to be elucidated. We examined endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA levels, mRNA stability and the transcriptional activities of the eNOS gene in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with fluvastatin and simvastatin. We further examined whether the effects of these statins differ dependent upon the -786T>C polymorphism in the eNOS gene, and whether these statins affect gene expression of replication protein A1 (RPA1), which is known to reduce the transcriptional activity of the eNOS gene with the -786C allele. Utilizing the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, fluvastatin significantly increased eNOS mRNA levels and mRNA stability, and decreased RPA1 mRNA levels. Luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that fluvastatin significantly increased the transcriptional activity of the eNOS gene. The effect of fluvastatin was stronger in the -786C/C genotype than in the -786T/T genotype. Simvastatin increased eNOS mRNA levels and mRNA stability, but did not affect the transcriptional activity of the eNOS gene. Fluvastatin increased eNOS mRNA levels by enhancing both the transcriptional activity and mRNA stability. The effect of fluvastatin on the transcriptional activity was augmented in the -786C/C genotype, probably because of a decrease in RPA1 gene expression. Simvastatin increased eNOS mRNA levels only by enhancing mRNA stability. The present study suggests that fluvastatin increases endothelial NO activity and thus may be more beneficial to patients with the -786C allele.", 
    "5": "The aim was to investigate whether polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene, encoding the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1, influence the short-term effects of pravastatin on cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "6": "We determined plasma concentrations of lathosterol and cholesterol up to 12 h after intake of a single dose of 40 mg pravastatin in 41 healthy Caucasian subjects, in whom SLCO1B1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; 521T>C and -11187G>A) and haplotypes (*15B and *17) had been previously shown to be associated with considerably elevated plasma pravastatin levels.", 
    "7": "The effects of pravastatin on plasma lathosterol concentration and lathosterol to cholesterol concentration ratio, which are established markers of the rate of cholesterol synthesis in vivo, were significantly smaller among the three heterozygous carriers of the SLCO1B1 *17 haplotype (containing the -11187G>A, 388A>G and 521T>C SNPs) as compared with non-carriers. Significant inverse relationships were found between pravastatin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values and effects of pravastatin on lathosterol and lathosterol to cholesterol ratio among the whole study population.", 
    "8": "These results suggest that uptake of pravastatin into hepatocytes is impaired in carriers of the SLCO1B1 haplotype *17, resulting in higher plasma pravastatin concentrations but lower concentrations of pravastatin in hepatocytes and thereby in a smaller inhibitory effect on cholesterol synthesis. The cholesterol-lowering response to pravastatin may be impaired in carriers of the *17 haplotype.", 
    "9": "Variation in the gene encoding toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a transmembrane receptor that mediates inflammatory responses to bacterial endotoxin, has been associated with susceptibility to atherosclerosis and its complications, such as myocardial infarction (MI), the pathogenesis of which involves inflammation. A recent study has also indicated that TLR4 gene variation influences the effect of statin treatment on reducing atherosclerosis complications. We studied the TLR4 gene Asp299Gly polymorphism in relation to susceptibility to myocardial infarction in a cohort of patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease, and performed a meta-analysis using data sets from three independent studies. The meta-analysis showed that overall, odds ratio (OR) for MI was 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.96, P=0.024] in 299Gly carriers compared to non-carriers, and there was no evidence of heterogeneity among the sample sets (P=0.679). In our patient cohort, a significant association of 299Gly bearing genotypes with lower susceptibility to myocardial infarction was observed only in patients receiving statin treatment, with 299Gly carriers having an OR of 0.49 (95% CI 0.27-0.78, P=0.015) for MI compared to non-carriers. These results are consistent with the notion that variation in the TLR4 gene contributes to inter-individual variability in susceptibility to coronary ischaemic events, and that TLR4 genotype and statin treatment may have a synergistic effect.", 
    "10": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is the most common inherited metabolic disease characterized by elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and ischaemic heart disease early in life. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent premature atherosclerosis in FH patients. The aim of our study was the evaluation of the effects of genetic [class of the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene mutation, apolipoprotein (apo)E, apoA-IV and cholesterol ester transfer protein gene polymorphisms] and environmental factors (age, sex, smoking habit and body mass index) on the lipid-lowering response to statin therapy in patients with molecularly defined FH. Atorvastatin 20 mg/day was prescribed in 49 patients with heterozygous FH. The lipid profile was examined before and after 12 weeks of therapy. Statin therapy resulted in a decrease of 37% and 36% in LDL-C and apoB levels, respectively. The study population was then divided into 2 groups according to the class of the LDLR mutation [patients sharing a class V mutation (the G1775A mutation, n=21) and patients sharing class II mutations (the G1646A and the C858A mutations, n=28)]. In both groups, the percentage decrement in LDL-C and apoB levels were correlated with the initial LDL-C and apoB levels, respectively. The class of the LDLR mutation affected the LDL-C and apoB-lowering response of heterozygous FH patients to statin therapy. In detail, heterozygotes sharing a class V mutation of the LDLR showed a higher percentage decrement in LDL-C and apoB levels after atorvastatin administration compared to patients sharing class II mutations (49+/-9% versus 34+/-9%, P=0.001 for LDL-C and 42+/-16% versus 35+/-20%, P=0.001 for apoB). The influence of the classes of the LDLR gene mutations on the change of LDL-C and apoB levels to atorvastatin was still significant in a multivariate analysis. None of the other genetic and environmental factors studied affected the lipid-lowering response to atorvastatin therapy in patients with heterozygous FH in a multivariate analysis. Our data indicate that the class of the LDLR gene mutation affects the LDL-C and apoB-lowering response of heterozygous FH patients to statin therapy. Specifically, patients with a class V mutation exhibit higher percentage decrease in LDL-C and apoB levels after statin therapy compared to patients sharing class II mutations.", 
    "11": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). Phenotypic expression is highly variable, being influenced by diet, age, gender, body mass index, apolipoprotein E genotype and type of LDL-receptor gene mutation. Microsomal triglyceride (TG) transfer protein (MTP) is a protein involved in lipid metabolism. Polymorphism MTP -493 GT has been shown to modulate lipid levels in several populations. To analyse the effect of this polymorphism in the lipid phenotype expression of FH and treatment response, we studied a sample of 222 Spanish FH patients, of whom 147 were studied before and after treatment with 20 mg of atorvastatin daily during 6 weeks. The variant was analysed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and single-strand confirmation polymorphism. Treatment reduced LDL-C, total cholesterol and TGs. Baseline fasting TGs and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lower in female T allele carriers (TG: 111+/-51 mg/dl GG, 89+/-35 mg/dl GT, 83+/-26 mg/dl TT, P=0.022; very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: 24+/-13 mg/dl GG, 16+/-5 mg/dl GT, 17+/-5 mg/dl TT, P=0.018). Triglyceride response to atorvastatin was modulated by this polymorphism in men (P=0.009), but not in women, although differences between genotypes were maintained after treatment. In conclusion, the MTP -493 GT polymorphism modulates pre- and post-treatment plasma TG values of FH in Spanish subjects in a gender-specific way. Other environmental and genetic factors likely also modulate this response.", 
    "12": "An open-label prospective cross-over trial was performed to evaluate the antioxidative effect of fluvastatin in Japanese type 2 diabetics with hyperlipidemia. The study subjects were 10 patients who were on pravastatin (10 mg/day) or simvastatin (5 mg/day). After at least 12 weeks of continuous pravastatin or simvastatin therapy, the drugs were washed out for 12 weeks and replaced with fluvastatin (30 mg/day), then the treatment was continued for another 12 weeks. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were efficiently and comparably reduced by all three statin agents. There were no differences in serum parameters of oxidative stress such as malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha between pravastatin/simvastatin and fluvastatin. However, fluvastatin, but not pravastatin/simvastatin, significantly reduced 3,5,7-cholestatriene in erythrocyte membrane, representing the extent of membrane cholesterol peroxidation. Our data demonstrated that fluvastatin has a unique anti-oxidative effect in patients with type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, compared with other statins.", 
    "13": "The present study shows that the incubation of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) and HepG2 cells with atorvastatin and mevastatin as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors potentiated the interferon-gamma (INF-gamma)-induced group IIA phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-IIA) expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The effect of statins on sPLA(2)-IIA expression was reduced by mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Inversely, inhibitors of the farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase-I mimicked the effects of statins. Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB), Y-27632 and H-1152, functioning as inhibitors of Rho proteins and Rho-associated kinase, also augmented the sPLA(2)-IIA expression in combination with IFN-gamma. The same effects were observed when inhibitors of mitogen-activated/extracellular response protein kinase kinase (MEK), PD98059 or U0126 were used. Further, the Janus kinase-2 (Jak2)-specific inhibitor, AG-490 and inhibitors of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) abrogated the sPLA(2)-IIA elevating effects of statins, TcdB and PD98059 in the presence of IFN-gamma. This cytokine alone increased the NFkappaB p65 and CAAT-enhancer-binding protein-beta (C/EBP-beta) activity in HASMC nuclear extract, but only C/EBP-beta was further augmented when the cells were incubated in addition to IFN-gamma with atorvastatin, H-1152, PD98059 or U0126. Moreover, after the incubation of cells with atorvastatin and IFN-gamma the stability of sPLA-(2)IIA mRNA significantly increased in comparison to those after incubation with IFN-gamma alone. In conclusion, the obtained data suggest that (i) the expression of sPLA(2)-IIA is negatively regulated by RhoA/Rho-associated kinase and MEK/ERK signaling pathways and (ii) statins, because of their ability to down-regulate these pathways, can potentiate the IFN-gamma-induced sPLA(2)-II expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.",

    "15": "Diabetes was induced in male Wistar rats by intrapetitoneal injection of STZ (65 mg/kg). Three groups were divided as: Sham group, diabetic control group and Lovastatin treatment group. Lovastatin (20 mg/kg) was administered daily by gavage from the next day of the induction diabetes for 4 weeks. Upro, ucr in urine and Glu, Scr, BUN in serum were determined. Immunohistochemistry and computer image-pattern analysis system were used to analyze expression of PCNA and p-CREB1. Western blot were performed to valuate the expression of p-CREB1 with their specific corresponding antibodies. CREB1 mRNA was measured by RT-PCR.",

    "18": "The use of cholesterol targets in cardiovascular disease prevention means that we must have access to highly effective, well-tolerated drugs. Rosuvastatin is the most recently introduced member of the statin class and offers powerful low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol lowering accompanied by sustained high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol raising and triglyceride lowering. As the single most effective cholesterol-lowering drug, its use is associated with a higher percentage of patients achieving either the US or European cholesterol goals than with other single agents. Rosuvastatin has been shown to have a safety profile comparable with other marketed statins, particularly in terms of potential liver, muscle or kidney toxicity. A large ongoing program of clinical trials, several of which have morbidity or mortality endpoints, is underway.", 
    "19": "Increasing clinical and experimental evidence indicates that some beneficial effects of statins, known as efficient therapeutic agents in cardiovascular disease treatment, may result from their ability to modulate vascular and endothelial cell gene expression by mechanisms independent of cholesterol reduction. It has been shown that statins exhibit direct anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion, as well as through adhesion molecule expression on leukocytes. Another important mechanism by which statins may modulate the immune response is inhibition of interferon gamma-induced expression of class II major histocompatibility complexes. Class II major histocompatibility complex expression is central to immune regulation in T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, indicating a potential beneficial role of statins in these pathologies. Indeed, promising new preclinical data indicate that statins might be useful in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.", 
    "20": "Clinical studies have shown that hydroxy-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may favorably affect atherothrombosis. In addition to their potent cholesterol-lowering properties, statins reduce atheroma progression as well as the incidence of acute thrombosis-related vascular events and their dreadful clinical consequences. Available data indicate that statins exert significant antithrombotic effects in clinical practice by reducing the occurrence of vascular atherothrombotic events, with a more prominent effect in high-risk patients. The mechanisms by which statins inhibit thrombosis have been extensively investigated, and several pathways appear to be involved. In particular, statins have been proposed to reduce platelet activation and to exert favorable effects on fibrinolysis, but no clear-cut conclusion can be drawn from available studies. Moreover, statins do not consistently influence fibrinogen or factor VII levels in plasma. In contrast, in vitro and in vivo data indicate that these compounds profoundly affect thrombin generation driven by tissue factor/factor VII pathway. In vitro studies indicate that this effect is not dependent on plasma cholesterol lowering but, rather, on the inhibition of isoprenoid biosynthesis. The relative contribution of reduced levels of prenylated proteins and of cholesterol pathway to the modulation of tissue factor expression is, however, hardly to be established in clinical settings.", 
    "21": "Coronary artery disease in the transplanted heart, also known as cardiac allograft vasculopathy, is one of the major causes of mortality late after heart transplantation. There are multiple immune and nonimmune risk factors associated with this disease process, one of which is hyperlipidemia. Use of lipid-lowering agents, specifically 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) was initially reported to have outcomes benefit and possibly immunosuppressive effects in a single-center study of heart transplant recipients. Other subsequent studies have supported this beneficial effect. Hyperlipidemia is associated with immune activity, particularly with respect to oxidation-sensitive signaling pathways. By lowering lipids, statins can ameliorate this immune activity, but it has been a matter of contention as to whether statins have cholesterol-independent immune-modulating effects. In two recent papers, cholesterol-independent immune effects of statins have been reported, including repressed induction of major histocompatibility complex class II by interferon-gamma, and selective blocking of leukocyte function antigen 1, both of which reduce the activation of T lymphocytes. The clinical reports demonstrating outcomes benefits in heart transplant recipients and recent laboratory publications that report an immunomodulatory effect of statins provide a firm scientific rationale to support the routine use of statins in heart transplant patients.", 
    "22": "Clinical studies indicate that 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy has a cardiovascular protective activity that may result from an improvement in endothelial function. Experimental studies have shown that statins protect against ischaemia-reperfusion injury of the heart and stimulate the growth of new blood vessels in ischemic limbs of normocholesterolemic animals. The mechanisms underlying these serum lipid-independent effects of statins are not completely understood, but there is increasing evidence that they improve endothelial function through molecular mechanisms that mediate an increase in endothelium-derived nitric oxide. Recent research has revealed a link between statins and the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt that regulates multiple angiogenic processes in endothelial cells, including the generation of nitrous oxide. In contrast to these data, it has also been reported that higher doses of statins inhibit endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. Thus, further studies on the actions of statins may lead to the identification of new pharmacological targets for the control of blood vessel growth.", 
    "23": "Statins appear to be potent drugs with a variety of pleiotropic effects with vasculoprotective and cardioprotective activity. The beneficial effects of statins on endothelial cells as well as on endothelial cell function appear to be related to improved nitric oxide bioavailability. Mechanistically, statins induce endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA stability in endothelial cells and promote endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity through a PI3K/Akt dependent pathway, which is a common signal transduction pathway shared by growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors or fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), estrogens, or statins. Furthermore, statins have potent antiinflammatory capacities by potently interfering with the generation of reactive oxygen species or activating scavenging systems for free radicals such as the thioredoxin system. These mechanisms might all contribute to improved NO bioavailability and confer the beneficial actions of statins. The proangiogenic properties of statins and their effects on reendothelialization following vessel injury include novel actions such as the mobilization, differentiation, and improved survival of endothelial progenitor cells. Statin therapy might reverse the impaired functional regeneration capacities seen in patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease or documented active coronary artery disease by specifically interacting with progenitor cell function. Accordingly, augmentation of functionally active endothelial progenitor cells with improved homing capacity will be a critical step in advancing therapeutic neovascularization as well as reendothelialization in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "24": "Cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and improve symptoms of heart failure by cholesterol-independent mechanisms. Statins block the isoprenylation and function of members of the Rho GTPase family, such as Rac1 and RhoA. Because Rac1 is a requisite component of NADPH oxidase, which is a major source of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular cells, the ability of statins to inhibit Rac1-mediated oxidative stress contributes importantly to their inhibitory effects on cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, inhibition of RhoA by statins leads to the activation of protein kinase B/Akt and upregulation of Type 3 nitric oxide synthase in the endothelium and the heart. This activation and upregulation results in increased angiogenesis and myocardial perfusion, decreased myocardial apoptosis, and improvement in endothelial and cardiac function. Because these effects of statins occur independent of cholesterol lowering, statins may have therapeutic benefits in nonhyperlipidemic patients with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.", 
    "25": "Hypertension and dyslipidemia are frequently associated as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Statins are among the most potent drugs to correct hypercholesterolemia, and their use across a wide range of cardiovascular risk levels significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in large intervention trials. Aside from (or in addition to) reducing plasma cholesterol, statins also reduce blood pressure, another effect associated with cardiovascular risk reduction by other antihypertensive drugs. This review examines the proposition that a part of the statins' beneficial effect in cardiovascular diseases may result from direct effects on blood pressure regulation, perhaps independent of lipid lowering. Potential molecular mechanisms are considered (e.g., \"pleiotropic\" effects on endothelial vasoactive mediators, oxidant stress, or inflammation), all of which may affect the central or peripheral control of blood pressure homeostasis, as well as modulate target organ damage. In particular, potential effects of statins on blood pressure and heart rate variability open new perspectives for a better tailoring of drug treatment in high-cardiovascular risk patients.", 
    "26": "Dyslipidemia plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease. Vascular inflammation also triggers the onset of acute complications of atherosclerosis, such as myocardial infarction. Advances in cardiovascular medicine demonstrate that lipid-lowering therapy by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) likely prevents acute coronary complications by limiting vascular inflammation. In particular, recent clinical evidence indicates aggressive lipid-lowering treatment for patients at risk. Preclinical studies also support the concept of anti-inflammatory properties of lipid lowering by either diet or statins. Therefore, dyslipidemia is the primary target of therapy for the prevention of coronary atherosclerosis and its acute thrombotic complications. Nevertheless, even aggressive statin therapy does not forestall many adverse events. Thus, current cardiovascular medicine also seeks mechanisms to mitigate vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis other than addressing low-density lipoprotein, and new therapeutic strategies beyond lipid lowering.", 
    "27": "The endothelium integrates and modulates critical functions of the arterial wall. As well as regulating vasomotion, it controls inflammation, coagulation, and thrombosis. Many of these actions are mediated through the release of nitric oxide. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with atherosclerosis and its risk factors. It is independently correlated to adverse cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, coronary death, and the need for revascularization. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) protect against cardiovascular death, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Although cholesterol reduction accounts for some of these benefits, others appear to be independent of cholesterol lowering. The endothelium mediates many of these \"lipid-dependent\" and \"lipid-independent\" actions of statins. This chapter reviews the effects of statins on endothelial dysfunction. To do so, a brief outline of the biology of the endothelium is a prerequisite. This will be followed by a summary of the advances in vascular research on cholesterol-dependent and cholesterol-independent effects of statins, with a focus on the endothelium. Ultimately, clinical relevance of observations derived from basic biology will be discussed.", 
    "28": "Lipid abnormalities play an important part in raising the cardiovascular risk in diabetic subjects. The main components of diabetic dyslipidemia are increased plasma triglycerides, low concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preponderance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein, and excessive postprandial lipemia. Small, dense low-density lipoprotein, the elevation in remnant triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles, and the low high-density lipoprotein are the most powerful atherogenic components. The coexistence of these three factors strongly aggravates the lipid accumulation in the arterial wall and the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The position of diabetes in cardiovascular risk assessment has been recently reviewed in the Harmonized Clinical Guidelines on Prevention of Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease. In general, patients with diabetes carry a high risk for cardiovascular disease, but the absolute risk varies depending on the type of diabetes, age, and population baseline risk. The Adult Treatment Program III (ATP III) and the American Heart Association have designated diabetes as a high-risk condition and recommended intensive risk-factor management. Concerning therapeutic targets, both ATP III and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines have identified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as the first priority of lipid lowering, and the optimal level was set at less than 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL). There is strong evidence, coming from landmark secondary prevention studies, that LDL lowering in people with diabetes is associated with significant clinical benefits. The benefits of statin therapy in type 2 diabetics can no longer be questioned. Ongoing clinical trials will help clarify the question of whether increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol with fibrates in the presence of low low-density lipoprotein levels (lower than 3.4 mmol/L, or 130 mg/dL) will be more beneficial than statin therapy alone. The new paradigms in risk-reduction therapies for type 2 diabetic subjects are focused on cardiovascular disease prevention, rather than only on glucose or lipid control. Therapeutic lifestyle changes are considered primary therapies for hyperglycemia and coexisting metabolic syndrome, which can be diagnosed in more than half of type 2 diabetes subjects. New perspectives of lipid management in type 2 diabetes should take into account that insulin resistance, increased lipolysis, and overproduction of large, buoyant, very low density lipoprotein particles are at the base of diabetic dyslipidemia. Accordingly, drugs acting in the regulatory steps of very low density lipoprotein assembly should be developed. Activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), as occurs with fibrates, lowers free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglyceride levels. PPARgamma agonism, as demonstrated by the thiazolidinediones, increases triglyceride lipolysis, FFA transport, and conversion of FFAs to triglycerides. As separate activation of PPARalpha and PPARgamma improves lipid metabolism, the development of new drugs integrating PPARalpha and PPARgamma activity (PPAR-alpha/gamma agonists) is a promising line that may further improve insulin resistance, FFA metabolism, and consequently, atherogenic diabetic dyslipidemia.", 
    "29": "The recommended therapy of hypercholesterolemia in children consists of dietary modification and bile acid-binding resins. Unfortunately, the lipid-lowering efficacy of bile acid-binding resins is modest, and moreover, long-term compliance is poor because of side effects. In contrast, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used in adults and are considered to be the first choice in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in that age category. In the last few years, several randomized trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of statin therapy in both children and adolescents. In this article, we review statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic children in terms of efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and psychosocial functioning. Statins are not only effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in children with familial hypercholesterolemia but also improve endothelial function and reduce the progressive thickening of the intima media complex of the carotid arteries. Statins seem safe at the longer term in children in terms of plasma levels of liver enzymes and liver function, creatine kinase levels, and muscle function, as well as growth and sexual development. Long-term follow-up studies are needed to assess whether statin treatment started early in children with familial hypercholesterolemia can prevent future cardiovascular events.", 
    "30": "Clinical trials have firmly established that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins) can induce regression of vascular atherosclerosis as well as reduction of cardiovascular-related morbidity and death in patients with and without coronary artery disease. These beneficial effects of statins are usually assumed to result from their ability to reduce cholesterol synthesis. However, because mevalonic acid is the precursor not only of cholesterol but also of many nonsteroidal isoprenoid compounds, inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase may result in pleiotropic effects. Indeed, statins can interfere with major events involved in the formation and the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions, such as arterial myocyte migration and proliferation and cholesterol accumulation, independent of their hypolipidemic properties. The aim of this article is to focus on clinical and experimental data that show that statins possess effects beyond cholesterol lowering, particularly on arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation. The contribution of these direct vascular effects to the reduction of cardiovascular events observed in clinical trials with statins represents one of the major challenges for future studies to understand the antiatherosclerotic benefits of these agents.", 
    "31": "Epidemiological studies have not demonstrated a clear relationship between stroke risk and hypercholesterolemia. Clinical trials using statins have demonstrated a reduction in stroke, in particular, in patients with established coronary artery disease. The disparity between epidemiological and clinical studies suggests hypercholesterolemia is a true risk factor for stroke that evaded detection in epidemiological studies, or that statins possess other properties that render them useful in stroke prevention. These effects have been loosely termed \"pleiotropic\" in the lipid literature and revolve around putative effects of statins on endothelial function, inflammation, thrombosis, plaque stability, and immune regulation. Questions remain as to the mechanisms of benefit of statin therapy in stroke prevention, the role of statins in the primary prevention of stroke, and the role of statins in modulating the immune system in the brain.", 
    "32": "The authors reviewed adverse events (AEs) reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration to determine the percentage of statin-associated AE reports with concurrent amiodarone use for simvastatin, atorvastatin, and pravastatin. AEs affecting the following organ systems were analyzed: muscle, liver, pancreas, and bone marrow. The percentage of simvastatin reports with concurrent amiodarone use was 1.0%, compared with 0.7% of the atorvastatin-associated reports (p = not significant). The percentage of pravastatin reports with concurrent amiodarone use was 0.4% (p < 0.05 for pravastatin vs. simvastatin). Muscle toxicity was the most commonly reported statin-amiodarone AE, accounting for 77% of the reports. AEs tended to occur in older male patients (mean age, 76 years), who were on multiple other medications (mean number of other medications, five). Clinicians should be vigilant about muscle-related complaints in patients concomitantly taking amiodarone, especially in elderly patients on multiple medications. Use of a statin not metabolized through the cytochrome P450-3A4 system may be appropriate in this setting.", 
    "33": "Anti-inflammatory effects of statins contribute to their clinical benefit. Molecular mechanisms underlying these effects have not been well explored. Because statins attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) responsiveness, we hypothesized that part of the pleiotropic effects are mediated through innate immunity.", 
    "34": "Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 expression and downstream signaling in CD14+ monocytes after incubation with simvastatin and atorvastatin were quantified via flow-cytometry, quantitative RT-PCR, kinase assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Incubation with intermediates/ inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway was used to identify the mode of statin action. Statin incubation resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of TLR4 expression (53+/-7.6% reduction compared with untreated monocytes; P<0.005), transcript levels (68+/-6.3%; P<0.002), decreased IRAK phosphorylation (37+/-8.3%; P<0.05), and LPS-induced IL-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and B7-1 expression (P<0.05). Four weeks of treatment with atorvastatin significantly reduced TLR4 expression on circulating CD14+ monocytes by 36.2+/-4.2% (P<0.05). Effects of statins were reversed by mevalonate (P=0.57). Incubation with specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyltransferase (54+/-4.3%), farnesyltransferase (57+/-5.1%), or with clostridium-difficile toxin B (58+/-6.1%, P<0.01) imitated the statin effects.

    "37": "Treatment with simvastatin, a hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, for 24 hours attenuated the transient [Ca2+]i elevation induced by thrombin. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that simvastatin decreased the surface expression of PAR1 in a manner dependent on protein geranylgeranylation. Introduction of a Rac1/Cdc42 inhibitory fragment but not a RhoA inhibitory fragment using a cell-penetrating peptide also attenuated the response to thrombin and decreased the surface expression of PAR1. Finally, downregulation of Rac1, but not RhoA, using an RNA interference technique attenuated the thrombin-induced [Ca2+]i elevation. However, the level of PAR1 mRNA and the total amount of PAR1 protein remained unchanged.", 
    "38": "Here, we provide for the first time 3 lines of evidence that Rac1 plays a critical role in maintaining the surface expression of PAR1 and the responsiveness to thrombin in vascular smooth muscle cells. Rac1 is suggested to regulate the constitutive trafficking of PAR1 and thereby regulate the surface expression of PAR1.",

Twenty-seven subjects at moderate to high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) received either simvastatin 80 mg/day for 3 days followed by placebo for 3 days or placebo followed by simvastatin. After a washout period of 10 to 14 days, subjects received the opposite treatment. Nonfasting blood lipid levels, including total cholesterol, direct LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides, were obtained before randomization and after each 3-day treatment period.", 
    "41": "The mean LDL-C level at baseline was 107 mg/dl and decreased 24% in patients receiving simvastatin and 5.6% in patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001). Statistically significant reductions were also achieved in the total cholesterol and cholesterol/HDL-C ratio: 14% and 12%, respectively. Changes in HDL-C and triglyceride levels were not significant.", 
    "42": "Treatment with simvastatin for only 3 days results in a 24% drop in the LDL-C level. As defined by ATPIII, this decrease is comparable to that necessary to lower the LDL-C from one risk level to a lower one and is, therefore, both clinically and statistically significant.",

    "47": "Dyslipidemia is frequent in patients with renal failure and in transplant recipient patients. This lead to a wide use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with impaired renal function or in patients treated with cyclosporine as post-transplantation immunosuppressive therapy. As a result, it is crucial for those patients' physicians to be aware of how to handle these drugs when renal function is impaired and/or when cyclosporine is co-administered. Most statins have an extensive hepatic elimination and the renal route is usually a minor elimination pathway. However, pharmacokinetic alterations have been described for some of these drugs in patients with renal insufficiency. Cyclosporine is a widely used immunosuppresive therapy in solid organ transplant patients and drug-drug interactions are likely to occur when statins and cyclosporine are administered together. Those interactions may theoretically result in increased statins and/or cyclosporine serum levels with potential muscle and/or renal toxicity. As a result, caution is warranted if concurrent administration is performed. In this review, we synthesized the data from the literature on (1) the pharmacokinetics and dosage adjustment of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin in patients with renal failure and (2) the potential drug-drug interactions between these drugs and cyclosporine in transplant recipient patients.",

Risk factors, cardiovascular medications and blood cholesterol were recorded; 'at risk' patients were invited for a review after 6 months. Of 17,570 patients assessed, CHD was clinically present in 12,045 (69%); in these, aspirin usage was high (78%) but fewer patients were on a beta-blocker (40%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (27%) or statin (49%). Blood pressure (BP) was controlled (<140/90) in only 41% of patients. Total cholesterol was >5 mmol/l in 49% of all CHD patients, half of whom were taking a statin. In the statin users, total cholesterol was uncontrolled (>5 mmol/l) in 38%. At follow-up, BP control remained at 42%, statin use increased to 57% and cholesterol remained elevated in 46%. Simple assessment in an audit programme fails to trigger change, and risk-factor modification for CHD remains inadequate.", 
    "49": "The treatment of dyslipoproteinemia has proven a successful strategy in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The major target of hypolipidemic drugs is the reduction of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (HMGRI) effectively lower LDL-C by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway and enhancing the activity of the LDL receptor (LDL-R). Numerous clinical studies demonstrated convincingly, that the reduction of LDL-C lowers the incidence of cardiovascular events in primary and secondary prevention. Two new HMGRI, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin, have been evaluated in clinical trials. Both drugs demonstrated efficacy in lowering atherogenic lipoproteins. In addition to the reduction of LDL-C, they may have a higher potency to lower triacylglycerides (TG) and to increase HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) compared to currently available HMGRI. Other therapeutic strategies examined in experimental animals are the inhibition of squalene synthase, the first enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, which is specifically committed to cholesterol biosynthesis, and the direct up-regulation of LDL receptor activity. The latter compounds, the SCAP ligands, are the first members of a new class of hypolipidemic agents affecting the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Recent treatment guidelines emphasise the importance of modifying lipid metabolism beyond lowering LDL-C, mainly by lowering TG and raising HDL-C. Although these actions are not primary targets of the compounds discussed here, it is interesting that drugs inducing the LDL-R usually also lower TG and, in the case of HMGRI, increase HDL-C.", 
    "50": "Cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival are regulated by a number of extracellular hormones, growth factors, and cytokines in complex organisms. The transduction of the signals by these factors from the outside to the nucleus often requires the presence of small intracellular proteins (i.e. ras and other small G proteins) that are linked to the plasma membrane through a isoprenyl residue that functions as hydrophobic anchor. Isoprenylation is a complex process regulated by different enzymatic steps that could represent potential molecular targets for anti-cancer strategies. In the present paper the different transduction pathways regulated by some isoprenylated proteins such as ras and other small G proteins are described. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms of the isoprenylation process and the mode of action of the different isoprenylation inhibitors are discussed with attention to statins, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) and aminobisphosphonates. The role of different candidate targets in the determination of anti-tumour effects by FTIs is also described in order to define potential molecular markers predictor of clinical response. On the basis of several preclinical data, new strategies based on multi-step enzyme inhibition or on target prioritization are proposed in order to enhance the anti-tumour activity of agents inhibiting isoprenylation. Finally, a summary of the principal data on clinical trials based on the use of FTIs and statins is given. In conclusion, the inhibition of isoprenylation is an attractive, but still not completely investigated therapeutic alternative that requires optimization for the translation in the current treatment of neoplasms.", 
    "51": "A series of prospective studies provide consistent data documenting that mild elevation of baseline levels of hs-CRP among apparently healthy individuals is associated with higher long-term risk for future cardiovascular events. This predictive capacity of hs-CRP is independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and offers a prognostic advantage over measurement of lipid alone. PHS and CARE trial suggest that the increased risk associated with systemic inflammation may be modified with certain preventive therapies and that inflammatory marker specifically hs-CRP may help to identify those who would benefit most from these pharmacological intervention. hs-CRP is the novel and evolving biomarker which provides a most useful predictive indicator for subsequent cardiovascular events. Based on various studies, increased hs-CRP levels in patients with high risk cardiovascular disease without documented CAD warrant treatment with statin even if LDL-C levels are within target range. Patients with documented CAD and high hs-CRP levels should be followed, and there risk factors should be managed aggressively.", 
    "52": "The effects of TaqI restriction fragment length polymorphism of the CETP gene on the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events were investigated in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). A total of 300 FH patients, of which 116 (39%) had CVD at the start of the study, were treated with statins during a mean period of 8.5 years. The distribution of Taq1B genotypes was 31% B1B1, 49% B1B2, and 20% B2B2. No differences were found at baseline between the three genotypes, except for an association of the B1 allele with lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels (P=0.003). All patients were put on statins within 6-8 weeks after the first visit; about 60% received simvastatin (20-40 mg daily) and 40% either pravastatin (40 mg daily) or atorvastatin (20-40 mg daily). The different statin treatments were similar for all groups. The mean change of plasma HDL-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and triglyceride concentration during statin therapy was similar for the three genotypes. During follow-up, new CVD events were recorded in 22 (37%) of the B2B2 patients (n=59) and in 67 (28%) of B1 allele carriers (n=241) (P=0.36). The relative risk for CVD events, after adjustment for age, gender, and CVD at intake, was 1.8 (CI: 1.1-3.0) for B2B2 carriers compared to B1 allele carriers. The Taq1B polymorphism is a significant predictor of future CVD events in statin-treated patients with FH. In spite of similar improvement of the lipoprotein profile during statin therapy, our FH patients with the B2B2 genotype may have a higher CVD risk in comparison with the B1 allele carriers.", 
    "53": "While statins have been highly effective for lowering serum cholesterol and reducing the incidence of coronary events, they have multiple other effects. Certain statins block the interaction of adhesion molecules that are important for cell-cell interactions including those between EBV-transformed B cells. These same statins inhibit NF-kappaB activation in the cells and induce apoptosis of transformed B cells. Studies in severe combined immunodeficiency mice show that simvastatin delays the development of EBV-lymphomas in these animals. These statins might be considered for the treatment of EBV-lymphomas in selected patients.",

We investigated the effects of atorvastatin on the functional and structural properties of blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the activity of astrocytes during the N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) hypertension followed by angiotensin (ANG) II. We found that decreases in concentration of serum catalase and plasma nitric oxide (NO) induced by L-NAME were significantly ameliorated by atorvastatin, whereas L-NAME-induced serum malondialdehyde and cholesterol concentration increases were significantly reduced by atorvastatin. The content of Evans blue (EB) dye significantly increased in cerebellum, left cerebral cortex and diencephalon regions but atorvastatin markedly reduced the increased BBB permeability to EB in the brain regions of animals treated with L-NAME and L-NAME plus ANG II. Brain vessels of L-NAME-treated animals showed a considerable loss of immunoreactivity of tight junction proteins, zonula occludens (ZO)-1 and occludin. Immunoreactivity for ZO-1 and occludin increased in animals treated with atorvastatin and L-NAME plus atorvastatin. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity was seen in few astrocytes in the brain sections of L-NAME, but immunoreactivity for GFAP increased in L-NAME plus atorvastatin-treated animals. We suggest that long-term L-NAME treatment may affect BBB permeability through disruption of tight junction proteins, at least partly, via decreased NO concentration and increased oxidant capacity; the improvement of BBB integrity and astrocytic activity would be more closely associated with the action of atorvastatin favoring the increase in anti-oxidant capacity and expression of tight junction proteins and GFAP.",

Metabolism of pitavastatin by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is minimal, principally through CYP 2C9, with little involvement of the CYP 3A4 isoenzyme, potentially reducing the risk of drug-drug interactions between pitavastatin and other drugs known to inhibit CYP enzymes.

    "76": "Vascular disease is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity on a worldwide basis and represents a major social burden. Atherothrombosis, which is one of the disease processes underlying vascular disease, consists of thrombus formation superimposed upon an existing atherosclerotic lesion. A number of factors are associated with the risk of developing atherothrombotic clinical events, such as myocardial infarction (MI) or ischaemic stroke (IS). The most significant of these include a previous vascular event (such as MI or IS), hypertension, obesity, diabetes and smoking. Encouraging patients to institute lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and smoking cessation can significantly reduce the risk of experiencing a primary or secondary vascular event. Lifestyle modifications must be supplemented with pharmacological therapies if a significant risk reduction is to be achieved. Studies have shown that antihypertensives, statins and antithrombotic agents are the most successful agents in reducing vascular risk and avoiding unpredictable and life-threatening atherothrombotic events.", 
    "77": "Statins have emerged as a highly efficacious class of drugs in the prevention of cardiovascular events. The primary mechanism of its cardioprotective effect is likely through its effectiveness in lowering serum lipids, particularly the low density lipoprotein (LDL) fractions. Recent studies suggest that statins also confer direct beneficial effects on the vascular cells in the attenuation of the atherogenic process through a variety of mechanisms. It remains the current dogma that oxidative modification of the LDL particles in the vessel wall plays a critical role for these lipoprotein particles to initiate the atherogenic cascade. The current failure of a number of antioxidants, which includes vitamin E, to favorably impact on the cardiovascular outcome in large scale clinical trials attests to the complexity of the oxidation processes in biological systems. In this review, we will highlight the current advances in a number of endogenous pro-oxidative and anti-oxidative systems in how they contribute to the net oxidative stress and how statin drugs may modulate this complex array of pro- and anti-oxidative processes.",

Statins are known to induce cellular apoptosis in vitro; however, the clinical relevance of this action remains controversial. This paper draws from 15 years' worth of research to explore the impact of statin treatment on cell fate, as represented by the interlinked processes of cellular growth, differentiation and apoptosis. In particular, I outline our current understanding of the pertinent molecular mechanisms; and discuss the evidence for clinical relevance of statin-induced apoptosis.", 
    "79": "Growing evidence suggests that statins are more than simple lipid-lowering drugs. The so called pleiotropic effects of statins include multiple actions on cells of the vasculature. A large number of studies have confirmed that these compounds exert beneficial effects by mechanisms unrelated to cholesterol metabolism. For example, statins have been shown to inhibit the migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), and to induce apoptosis in this cell type. It is not yet clear if the induction of apoptosis in VSMC by statins is beneficial or detrimental. In the context of post-angioplasty restenosis, recurrent plaque growth after intervention, the inhibition of neointimal proliferation as well as a reduction of neointimal cell numbers by apoptosis is appealing. Multiple animal studies and clinical trials have therefore been undertaken to investigate effects of statin treatment on the development of restenosis, with very controversial results. Conversely, in advanced atherosclerotic lesions VSMC in the intima may stabilize the plaque and prevent plaque rupture by synthesizing collagen. VSMC in media adjacent to plaque areas or restenotic lesions should not be exposed to apoptosis promoting agents. In this context, recent evidence suggests that pravastatin protects such lesions by inhibiting inflammation and macrophage activation Our recent findings together with observations from other groups suggest that neointima cells are more sensitive to the induction of apoptosis than media VSMC. Importantly, statins were found to preferentially induce apoptosis in neointimal VSMC in our study. The purpose of the present review is to summarize statin effects on proliferation and apoptosis in VSMC in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the development of drug-coated stents may help to deliver high local doses of statins to enhance their effectiveness in the treatment of post-angioplasty restenosis.", 
    "80": "Atherosclerosis and its complications still represent the major cause of death in developed countries. Statins have revolutionized the treatment of dyslipidemia and demonstrated their ability to reduce and prevent coronary morbidity and mortality. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an enzyme crucial to cholesterol synthesis. The effectiveness and rapidity of statin-induced decreases in coronary events led to the speculation that statins possess cholesterol-independent effects. Since mevalonate produced by the HMG-CoA reductase is not only the precursor of cholesterol, but also of non steroidal isoprenoid compounds, such as the farnesyl pyrophosphate and the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, statins also regulate the small signaling proteins, Ras and Rho. Thus, inhibition of these prenylated proteins might account for the non-lipid lowering effects of statins. In this review, we describe the numerous beneficial pleiotropic effects of statins that could modulate atherogenesis.", 
    "81": "Hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) offer important benefits for the large populations of individuals at high risk for coronary heart and cerebrovascular disease. the overall clinical benefits observed with statin therapy appear to be greater than what might be expected from changes in lipid profile alone, suggesting that the beneficial effects of such drugs may extend beyond their effects on serum cholesterol. Platelet hyperactivity is a key step in atherothrombosis and experimental data suggest that statins could exert an antiplatelet effect which could be involved in their protective action. In the present review we report of the major studies in humans showing the effect of statins on platelets, especially by the more sensitive methods to explore platelet function such as cytofluorymetric detection of specific proteins. Moreover we describe the putative mechanisms involved in platelet deactivation with particular regard to the effects related to cholesterol reduction or beyond lipid-lowering. Indeed, data from several studies suggest some differences among compounds in terms of timing of action by modulation of several activating pathways which could take part either in the early, cholesterol-lowering independent, effects in the acute phase of vascular disease or during chronic treatment.", 
    "82": "L-Mevalonic acid is the distant precursor of cholesterol, in contrast to cholesterol, L-mevalonic acid, its distant precursor gives rise to farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphates in relatively few metabolic steps. These isoprenyl pyrophophates covalently conjugate with specific G-proteins and serve as membrane anchors enabling them to carry out their function. Although farnesyl-proteins may participate in signal transduction, geranylgeranyl-proteins (e.g., Rho GTP binding proteins) are well known to downregulate signaling pathways by inhibiting L-mevalonic acid synthesis. Such inhibitors include 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, drugs (statins) and isoprenoids of dietary origins, where Rho protein activation appears to be necessary for cellular-mediated thrombin generation. Thrombin and other proteases (e.g., coagulation factor Xa, tryptase) upregulate protease-activated receptor (PAR) synthesis and PAR activation promotes synthesis and expression of other proteins [e.g., tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)]. With the PAR-1 activating peptide SSFLRNP, we found that either cerivastatin or atorvastatin mitigated platelet stimulation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as predicted if a statin-mediated Rho pathway is required. We also found that simvastatin decreased prothrombin fragments F1+2 in plasma from type 2 diabetics, demonstrating that statins downregulate thrombin generation. Thus, independent of cholesterol, statins and dietary isoprenoids behave as inhibitors of TF-dependent thrombin generation. Because thrombin has multiple physiological functions, the 20 pleiotropic effects reported for statins may reflect a common mechanism for downregulation of thrombin-mediated events, in particular at the cellular level.", 
    "83": "The use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of primary and secondary ischemic stroke in patients with ischemic heart disease (relative risk reduction is 20-30%), confirmed by several prospective randomized placebo-controlled trials. At least one large prospective trial has also shown a similar benefit in patients without underlying ischemic heart disease. This is in contrast to an open-labeled trial conducted in the USA, which failed to demonstrate a significant benefit of statins in reducing stroke risk in hypertensive hyperlipidemic patients. It is less clear if treatment with statins before or after the onset of ischemic stroke also reduces its severity (improves outcome). Experimental animal studies where mice were pretreated with statins, demonstrated a reduced infarct size compared with untreated animals. Treatment with statins after stroke onset has also been demonstrated to enhance recovery without influencing infarct size (by increased angiogenesis, synaptogenesis and blood flow). A few clinical retrospective studies have demonstrated similar results. Prospective blinded placebo-controlled trials to test these findings are still lacking. This review discusses the various prospective trials in stroke prevention and available data on the effects of statins in improving outcome of established ischemic stroke. Alternate mechanisms of statins besides their lipid-lowering effect and relevance in reducing stroke risk and improving outcome are discussed. Finally, based on the present information, an evidence-based perspective about current and future use of statins in the short- and long-term management of ischemic stroke is presented.", 
    "84": "The past 4 years have seen a growing interest in cholesterol metabolism and its relationship to Alzheimer's disease. From the first report linking cholesterol and beta-amyloid metabolisms to the recent positive report on the use of atorvastatin (Lipitor, Pfizer Inc.), a cholesterol-lowering drug, in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, this review examines the scientific progress pertaining to etiopathology of Alzheimer's disease over the past 15 years and the central role of lipids in this field of research. The role of key proteins involved in this metabolic pathway such as apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein lipase, caveolin, hydroxy-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase, low-density lipoprotein receptors, cholesterol 24-hydroxylase, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase and beta-amyloid are discussed.", 
    "85": "Although statins are being used for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke, recent experimental data have shown new pleiotropic effects of these drugs independent of their lipid-lowering properties that might be responsible for their role in neuroprotection. In fact, statins have been successfully tested in animal models of acute cerebral ischemia. In humans, the possibility that statins could be used for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke has not yet been addressed, however, a pilot trial and observational studies testing this approach showed promising results for a disease in which tissue plasminogen activator is the only available treatment for a reduced number of patients. The aim of this review is to answer the basic question of whether treatment with statins initiated in the acute phase of ischemic stroke is feasible and if it can improve neurologic outcome. The possible benefits of this scenario will be discussed.", 
    "86": "Hypertonia is a widespread disease among the population, and one of the most important reasons behind the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. In the past few years, recommendations from the American (JNC 7), the European (ESH/ESC 2003) and the Hungarian Hypertonia Associations have been published. The international and domestic recommendations are similar in that they all state that normal and optimal blood pressure is 120/80 Hgmm. The lower limit of hypertonia is specified as 140/90 Hgmm. The reduction of risks is an absolute priority in the treatment of hypertonia. Before starting the administration of medicines, the patient's risk category is identified and a target blood pressure is specified. The treatment strategy is then set up. The recommendations deal in detail with the first choice, the fixed and not fixed combinations of medicines to be administered. All three recommendations pay special attention to the determination of the indicators of preventing thrombocyte aggregation and statin treatments.",

    "88": "Serum samples from 31 consecutive Pakistani angina patients undergoing CABG at the Aga Khan University Hospital were analyzed for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides using kit methods.", 
    "89": "Immediately after CABG, there is a significant decline in the mean levels of serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. However, 5 days post CABG, there is a significant increase in the concentrations of total cholesterol (P = 0.01) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.001) in nondiabetic angina patients (n = 13). Among the diabetic group of patients (n = 18), the levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides went back to the pre-operative levels within 5 days post CABG. Compared to European patients, Pakistani patients tend to have very low levels of HDL cholesterol (24.9 +/- 7.1 mg/dl) and high levels of triglycerides (185 +/- 50 mg/dl) on day 5 post CABG.", 
    "90": "Since risk of mortality following CABG increases with low level of HDL cholesterol and high level of triglycerides, close monitoring and treatment of high lipid levels of Pakistani patients following CABG is necessary to prevent further coronary events.", 
    "91": "Clinical trials have shown the benefits of statins after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, it is unclear whether different statins exert a similar effect in reducing the incidence of recurrent AMI and death when used in clinical practice.", 
    "92": "We conducted a retrospective cohort study (1997-2002) to compare 5 statins using data from medical administrative databases in 3 provinces (Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia). We included patients aged 65 years and over who were discharged alive after their first AMI-related hospital stay and who began statin treatment within 90 days after discharge. The primary end point was the combined outcome of recurrent AMI or death from any cause. The secondary end point was death from any cause. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for each statin compared with atorvastatin as the reference drug were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.", 
    "93": "A total of 18,637 patients were prescribed atorvastatin (n = 6420), pravastatin (n = 4480), simvastatin (n = 5518), lovastatin (n = 1736) or fluvastatin (n = 483). Users of different statins showed similar baseline characteristics and patterns of statin use. The adjusted HRs (and 95% confidence intervals) for the combined outcome of AMI or death showed that each statin had similar effects when compared with atorvastatin: pravastatin 1.00 (0.90-1.11), simvastatin 1.01 (0.91-1.12), lovastatin 1.09 (0.95-1.24) and fluvastatin 1.01 (0.80-1.27). The results did not change when death alone was the end point, nor did they change after adjustment for initial daily dose or after censoring of patients who switched or stopped the initial statin treatment.",

This study aimed to revise and customize the revised cardiac risk (Lee) index to estimate the probability of perioperative all-cause mortality in patients undergoing noncardiac vascular surgery.", 
    "96": "We studied 2310 patients (mean age, 67.8 +/- 11.3 years; 1747 males) who underwent acute or elective major noncardiac vascular surgery between January 1, 1991, and December 31, 2000, at the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. A total of 1537 patients were assigned for model development, in which the associations between predictor variables and mortality occurring within 30 days after surgery were identified to modify the Lee index, which was then evaluated in a validation cohort of 773 patients.", 
    "97": "The perioperative mortality rates were similar in the development (n = 103 [6.7%]) and validation (n = 50 [6.5%]) populations. The customized risk-prediction model for perioperative mortality identified type of vascular surgery, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, previous stroke, hypertension, renal dysfunction, and chronic pulmonary disease as being associated with increased risk, whereas beta-blocker and statin use were associated with a lower risk of mortality. The performance of the customized index had excellent discriminative ability in both derivation and validation populations (concordance statistic, 0.88 and 0.85, respectively).", 
    "98": "The customized index provides more detailed information than the Lee index about the type of vascular procedure, clinical risk factors, and concomitant medication use. The customized probability model can be a useful tool to estimate the risk of perioperative all-cause mortality and facilitate subsequent treatment strategies.", 
    "99": "Progression of coronary artery calcium, a marker of atherosclerosis, can be slowed with statins, and continued progression of calcium is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. However, it is not known whether statins are effective in slowing calcium progression in diabetes mellitus. In a retrospective study, we examined 1153 nondiabetic and 157 diabetic subjects who underwent sequential electron beam tomography scans at a minimum 1-year interval to assess progression of coronary calcium. A yearly score increase >15% was considered evidence of true progression. The use of statins and occurrence of myocardial infarction were recorded. There was no difference in baseline calcium score between diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Diabetic patients with no coronary calcium on the baseline scans developed it more often than nondiabetic subjects (42% versus 25%; P=0.046) during follow-up. Calcium progression was 33% greater in diabetic patients than nondiabetic subjects (P<0.001) if no statin therapy was provided and 17.7% greater when statins were used (P<0.001). Among the 49 subjects who experienced a myocardial infarction, the calcium score increased on average 20% more in diabetic than nondiabetic patients (P<0.001). In logistic models, diabetes mellitus and systemic hypertension were the best predictors of calcium progression (odds ratio, 3.1 and 1.9, respectively), whereas baseline calcium score percentile and statin therapy were the best predictors of infarction. These findings support the notion that diabetes mellitus causes accelerated atherosclerosis, even in the presence of statin therapy, and provide evidence that coronary calcium monitoring is an effective method to assess treatment efficacy.", 
    "100": "Statins, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, have pleiotropic benefits independent of cholesterol levels, including anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we investigate the effect of statins on myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression. MPO, expressed in foam cell macrophages, was recently shown to oxidize the ApoA-1 component of HDL, impairing ABCA-1 mediated cholesterol efflux. High levels of serum MPO correlate with increased risk of CAD events. Findings here show that statins strongly inhibit MPO mRNA expression in human and murine monocyte-macrophages. Suppression was reversed by downstream intermediates of HMG-CoA reductase, mevalonate, and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not farnesylpyrophosphate. An inhibitor of geranylgeranyltransferase, GGTI-286, mimics the effects of statins, indicating geranylgeranylation is key to MPO expression. Reduction of MPO mRNA levels was observed in vivo in leukocytes from statin-fed mice, correlating with reductions in MPO protein and enzyme activity. These findings suggest that the pleiotropic protections afforded by statins may be due in part to suppression of MPO expression.", 
    "101": "Endothelial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, fibrosis and vascular occlusion after radiation therapy. Statins have been reported to improve endothelial function; however, this beneficial effect on endothelial cells has never been investigated after irradiation. Therefore, using human microvascular endothelial cells from lung that had been irradiated with 5 or 10 Gy, we assessed the effect of pravastatin on endothelial activation by ELISA, cell-ELISA and electrophoretic mobility shift assay and increased blood-endothelial cell interactions by a flow adhesion assay. Pravastatin inhibited the overproduction of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IL6 and IL8 and the enhanced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 but had no effect on platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 expression. Moreover, pravastatin down-regulated the radiation-induced activation of the transcription factor activator protein 1 but not of nuclear factor-kappaB. Finally, an inhibition by pravastatin of increased adhesion of leukocytes and platelets to irradiated endothelial cells was observed. The effect of pravastatin was maintained up to 14 days after irradiation and was reversed by mevalonate. Pravastatin exerts persistent anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects on irradiated endothelial cells. Statins may be considered in therapeutic strategies for the management of patients treated with radiation therapy.", 
    "102": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, and recent in vitro and animal data suggest that statins promote bone formation and increase bone strength. We examined the relationship between sustained continuous delivery of statin and fracture healing rates in adult male animals with femoral segmental fractures. Because statin affects the production of cholesterol we also evaluated the influence of statin, on adrenal and testicular steroidogenesis and the morphology of the reproductive tract tissues in animals receiving statin for a period of 12 weeks post surgery. Simvastatin significantly increased fracture healing and without significant influence on the body weights and the weights of the reproductive organs. Basal plasma LH, FSH and testosterone levels were not affected by active treatment with simvastatin. Reproductive tissue morphology was unchanged by local sustained release of statin. In conclusion, long-term simvastatin treatment delivered at a fracture target site did not influence testicular reproductive and endocrine function, but was able to effectively heal complicated segmental fracture.",

MSD Consumer Pharmaceuticals). It is the first statin in the world to be sold without prescription. Zocor Heart-Pro is licensed to reduce the risk of a first major coronary heart disease (CHD) event in people likely to be at \"moderate risk\" of such problems. Here we review the rationale and process for reclassifying simvastatin 10mg as an over-the-counter product.", 
    "104": "Colestimide, a 2-methylimidazole-epichlorohydrin polymer, is a new bile-acid-sequestering resin, that is 4-fold as powerful at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as the conventional resin (cholestyramine). Moreover, colestimide has excellent patient compliance because it is available in tablet form.", 
    "105": "The clinical efficacy of colestimide coadministered with atorvastatin on lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations was examined in 15 patients (M/F=10/5, mean+/-SE age=54+/-9 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). After a period of wash-out of any lipid-lowering drugs, atorvastatin (20-40 mg) was administered to patients for at least 8 weeks, and then 3 g of colestimide was administered for a further 8 weeks. Total and LDL-C significantly (<0.0001) decreased by 35% from 361 to 233 mg/dl and 41% from 274 to 161 mg/dl, respectively. Addition of colestimide caused a further significant 12% and 20% reduction, respectively, from the initial values to 205 and 129 mg/dl, respectively. Colestimide was also effective in reducing serum LDL-C concentrations in heterozygous FH patients with hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides>or=150 mg/dl).", 
    "106": "When monotherapy with atorvastatin is insufficient to treat severely hypercholesterolemic patients, such as those with heterozygous FH, colestimide acts to reinforce the action of statins.", 
    "107": "Myopathy is usually a non-fatal muscle disease involving skeletal muscle weakness, tenderness and pain with the possibility of the plasma creatinine kinase elevation. There are many different types of myopathies, some of which are genetic, inflammatory, or related to endocrine dysfunction. Also, numerous drugs have been reported to possess myotoxic effect. Myopathy is included among the potential side-effects and toxicities associated with the lipid lowering agents, particularly 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. However, the precise mechanism of statin-induced muscle toxicity remains unclear. The muscle-related side-effects reported with lipid-lowering drugs are significant but quite rare (0.1%), when used in monotherapy; while the incidence of steroid-induced myopathy has varied from 7 to 60%% and chronic alcoholic myopathy seems to be common complication of alcoholism affecting approximately 50% of patients, respectively. This review focuses on the differential pathophysiological grounds of these muscular injuries induced by statins, fibrates, as well as some other agents: corticosteroids or alcohol. A wide spectrum of possible mechanisms and hypotheses including muscle enzyme defects, changes in mitochondrial function and intracellular metabolism, the influence on the cell membrane stability and drug interactions involving P-glycoprotein or cytochrome P 450 system have been presented.", 
    "108": "Drugs used for immunosuppression have been implicated in causing numerous long-term side effects including nephrotoxicity, glucose intolerance, and hyperlipidemia. In this study, we reviewed our pediatric liver transplant recipients in terms of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as well as fasting glucose and lipid profiles. To date, 79 pediatric liver transplantations have been performed at our center: 24 transplantations of at least 5 months to a maximum of 7.3 years posttransplant are reviewed herein. The mean time posttransplantation was 2.1 years. Nine boys and 15 girls showed a distribution of 19 mixed race, 3 black, and 2 white patients. The mean age at the time of transplantation was 6.6 years (0.8-13.3 years) with 8 cases under the age of 3 years. All recipients started with Cyclosporine Neoral (CSA) as first line, but, at the time of testing, immunosuppression included 5 children on CSA and 19 on Tacrolimus. Radionuclide 51 Cr-EDTA Glomerular Filtration Rates (GFR) showed a range from 21 to 220 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean 96.1, median 89.8). Seven cases had a GFR less than 75 mL/min/1.73 m2. Twenty-one children were on antihypertensives agents: 15 children on 1 agent and 6 children on 2 agents. On full fasting lipid profiles, the total cholesterol ranged from 2 to 7.9 mmol/L (mean 4.4). Only 1 child is currently on statin therapy. Fasting glucose ranged from 3.2 to 5.9 mmol/L (mean 4.1) No difference was observed in glucose values between CsA and Tacrolimus. Thus, immunosuppressive therapies, such as the calcineurin inhibitors, are known to cause nephrotoxicity, which is of concern in pediatric liver transplant recipients. Almost all our patients currently require antihypertensive therapy. At present, the renal function is adequate in the majority of the group, but this study needs to be extended to other pediatric liver transplant recipients with particular emphasis on those who are more than 5 years posttransplantation.",

The reduction was even greater (54%, P<.001), when only patients who were hospitalized more than once in the preceding year were analyzed. Moreover, in addition to the improvements noted during follow-up in patients' understanding of the disease and in several aspects of self-care, the increase in treatment use was also remarkable: beta-blocker use increased from 53% to 70%, spironolactone use from 20% to 30%, and statin use from 36% to 58%.", 
    "116": "The number of hospital admissions for heart failure among patients who received attention at our multidisciplinary unit was significantly less in the first year of follow-up than in the year preceding attendance. This reduction was probably due to educational and pharmacologic interventions and to closer follow-up.",

We investigated the apoptotic mechanism of lovastatin on human melanoma cell lines in vitro. The cytotoxicity of statins on multiple cell lines was examined by Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One solution cell proliferation assay (MTS assay). Apoptosis was assayed by ethidium bromide and acridine orange morphologic assays, an Annexin V apoptosis detection kit and active caspase 3 assays. Farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate add-back experiments were performed to better define the molecular mechanisms mediating lovastatin cytotoxicity. Lovastatin caused cytotoxicity in human and murine melanoma cells, but did not induce toxicity in an epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431. For human melanoma cells, lovastatin precipitated cell rounding, increased the percentage of apoptotic cells detected by ethidium bromide and acridine orange staining and by the Annexin V apoptosis detection kit, and resulted in a 50-fold increase in active caspase 3, corroborating that lovastatin induced apoptosis. Adding back geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate, reversed the effects of lovastatin in A375 cells. Of the five statins tested, pravastatin was least effective in killing melanoma cells. Lovastatin induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in multiple melanoma cell lines via a geranylation-specific mechanism. This study supports a possible role of lovastatin as a therapeutic, adjuvant or chemopreventive agent for melanoma.",

AD is a complex multifactorial disorder that involves numerous susceptibility genes, but the exact pathogenesis and biochemical basis of AD is not well understood Cholesterol is receiving a great deal of attention as a potentially crucial factor in the etiology of AD. Almost all cholesterol in the brain is synthesized in the brain. Cholesterol exits the brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the form of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) or by first being converted to a more polar compound, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol, which is elevated in individuals with AD. The key event leading to AD appears to be the formation and aggregation in the brain of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide, a proteolytically derived product of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Cholesterol has been demonstrated to modulate processing of APP to Abeta. High levels of cholesterol are associated with increased risk of AD. Patients taking cholesterol-lowering statins have a lower prevalence of AD. ApoE, which transports cholesterol throughout the brain, exhibits an isoform-specific association with AD such that the E4 isoform, by unknown mechanisms, shifts the onset curve toward an earlier age.", 
    "138": "Modulation of T cell response is a novel property of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors. Previously we reported the benefits of atorvastatin treatment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the murine model of the T cell-mediated autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis, in which a blockade of the T cell cycle by atorvastatin was attributed to an accumulation of the negative regulator p27(Kip1). We show in this report that, in line with the documented role of p27(Kip1) in T cell anergy, treatment with atorvastatin results in a deficient response to a second productive stimulus in human T cells. This effect of atorvastatin was dependent on HMG-CoA reduction and required IL-10 signaling. Importantly, atorvastatin induced an early and sustained phosphorylation of ERK1, but not ERK2, which was crucial for the induction of anergy. On the basis of the therapeutic impact of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, the present findings should pave the way for future therapeutic concepts related to tolerance induction in neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis.", 
    "139": "The injury of podocytes is associated with alterations of the glomerular size-selective barrier to proteins. In this study, oxidized LDL (oxLDL) but not native LDL induced apoptosis in human cultured podocytes and reduced Akt activity and P-Akt/Akt ratio. Moreover, oxLDL-induced redistribution and loss of nephrin, an adhesion molecule specific for the glomerular slit diaphragm. Nephrin reduction was preceded by inhibition of nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation and of its association with p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Moreover, three different statins, mevastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner apoptosis and loss of nephrin induced by oxLDL by stimulating Akt activity. In addition, simvastatin significantly increased the expression of nephrin protein and mRNA by podocytes. The protective effects of statins were blocked by treatment of podocytes with two unrelated pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K, LY294002 and wortmannin, suggesting a role for PI3K, and by mevalonate, indicating dependency on HMG-CoA reductase activity. Statins directly stimulated Akt phosphorylation ad activity. Finally, oxLDL induced a retraction of cultured podocytes and an increase in the albumin diffusion across their monolayer that was inhibited by treatment with statins. In conclusion, statins reduced the oxLDL-induced apoptosis and loss of nephrin in glomerular podocytes. The statin-induced Akt activation may protect from the loss of nephrin by an inhibition of its redistribution and shedding and by a stimulation of its synthesis. These data provide a rationale for the anti-proteinuric effect of statins.", 
    "140": "The vascular events that happen during ischemic stroke worsen outcomes in patients by causing edema, hemorrhagic transformation, and general neurologic tissue compromise. In the past 2 decades, clinical trials in patients after ischemic stroke focused on neuroprotection, but these strategies have failed in providing actual benefit. Vascular protection represents a new field to be explored in acute ischemic stroke in order to develop new approaches to therapeutic intervention.", 
    "141": "We identified tactics likely to provide vascular protection in patients with ischemic stroke. These tactics are based on knowledge of the molecular processes involved.", 
    "142": "The pathologic processes due to vascular injury after an occlusion of a cerebral artery can be separated into acute (those occurring within hrs), subacute (hrs to days), and chronic (days to mo). Targets for intervention can be identified for all three stages. In the acute phase, superoxide is the predominant mediator, followed by inflammatory mediators and proteases in the subacute phase. In the chronic phase, proapoptotic gene products have been implicated. Many already-marketed therapeutic agents (statins, angiotensin modulators, erythropoietin, minocycline, and thiazolidinediones), with proven safety in patients, have been shown to have activity against some of the key targets of vascular protection.", 
    "143": "Currently available pharmacologic agents are poised for clinical trials of vascular protection after acute ischemic stroke.", 
    "144": "Because the risk for myopathy increases when 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors (statins) are used with other agents known to inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 in patients with dyslipidemia, we sought to quantify this risk in a diverse, real-world sample of patients receiving statin therapy.", 
    "145": "Retrospective chart review.", 
    "146": "Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO), a group model health maintenance organization with approximately 360,000 members.", 
    "147": "Four hundred sixty-eight patients who were identified as having a diagnosis of myopathy over a 4-year period using KPCO computerized data systems.", 
    "148": "Medical records were reviewed to confirm myopathy cases associated with statin therapy. Of the 468 patients, 61 had received statin therapy before their diagnosis, and 41 (67%) of these patients had confirmed myopathy (documented creatine kinase level>or=1000 IU/L). The prevalence of myopathy was 0.12% with statin monotherapy and 0.22% with statins in combination with interacting drugs. Only 17 of the 41 (41%) patients had confirmed myopathy with no other plausible clinical explanation, such as a muscle injury. Increased risk of myopathy associated with statin therapy in combination with interacting drugs approached statistical significance (p=0.052) but was of minimal clinical significance.", 
    "149": "The prevalence of confirmed myopathy in patients receiving statin therapy is low (<1%). Combining statin therapy with interacting drugs (e.g., fibrates) was not associated with a clinically important increase in the prevalence of myopathy. The risk of developing myopathy during statin therapy is outweighed by the benefits derived from the therapeutic effects of the therapy.", 
    "150": "To determine the effects of atorvastatin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) particle size and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. Another objective was to compare the effects of atorvastatin on lipoprotein profiles as determined by direct versus indirect assessment of lipoprotein composition.", 
    "151": "Randomized, parallel-group substudy.", 
    "152": "Two university-affiliated outpatient hemodialysis centers.", 
    "153": "Nineteen patients with LDL levels above 100 mg/dl and with at least two cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "154": "Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to atorvastatin 10 mg/day or no treatment (control) for 20 weeks.", 
    "155": "We compared the differences between LDL particle size and CRP levels at baseline and 20 weeks in the atorvastatin versus control groups. Baseline demographic characteristics were similar between the two groups. Atorvastatin therapy was associated with no change in mean LDL particle size (p=0.23) and with a 90% decrease in mean CRP level (p=0.52). When evaluated by standard chemical analysis, atorvastatin therapy reduced total cholesterol levels by 29% (p=0.025) and resulted in nonsignificant reductions in LDL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Treatment with atorvastatin was not associated with significant changes in lipoprotein profile as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.", 
    "156": "Treatment with atorvastatin did not affect LDL particle size but was associated with a sizable, yet nonsignificant, reduction in CRP concentrations. The drug had variable effects on lipoprotein concentrations as determined by chemical and NMR analytical methods. A larger study is necessary to provide definitive information on the effects of atorvastatin on LDL phenotype and CRP in patients with kidney disease.", 
    "157": "A recent European case-control study suggested that statins increase the risk for polyneuropathy, a rare but serious neurologic condition. This risk was assessed in 272 patients with idiopathic polyneuropathy and 1,360 matched controls in the Intermountain Health Care electronic database. It was found that statin use before diagnosis was not significantly greater in patients than controls (odds ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 0.3 to 2.1, p = 0.27), nor were doses different between patients and controls."
