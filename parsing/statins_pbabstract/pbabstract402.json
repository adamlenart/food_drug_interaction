    "0": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids, is subject to rapid degradation which is regulated by mevalonate (MVA)-derived metabolic products. HMG-CoA reductase is an integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, the largest nonmitochondrial pool of cellular Ca2+. To assess the possible role of Ca2+ in the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, we perturbed cellular Ca2+ concentration and followed the fate of HMG-CoA reductase and of HMGal, a fusion protein consisting of the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase and the soluble bacterial enzyme beta-galactosidase. The degradation of HMGal mirrors that of HMG-CoA reductase, demonstrating that the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase is sufficient to confer regulated degradation (Skalnik, D.G., Narita, H., Kent, C., and Simoni, R.D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6836-6841; Chun, K.T., Bar-Nun, S., and Simoni, R.D. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 22004-22010). In this study we show that the MVA-dependent accelerated rates of degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal in cells maintained in Ca(2+)-free medium are 2-3-fold slower than the rate of degradation in cells grown in high (1.8-2 mM) Ca2+ concentration. This effect is reversed upon addition of Ca2+ to the medium. Furthermore, when cells maintained in high Ca2+ are treated with 1 microM ionomycin, the MVA-dependent accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal is also reduced about 2-3-fold. This inhibition is not due to a Ca(2+)-dependent uptake or incorporation of MVA into sterols, since these processes are not affected in the absence of external Ca2+. In addition, cobalt, a known antagonist of Ca(2+)-dependent cellular functions, totally abolishes (IC50 = 520 microM in the presence of 1.8 mM extracellular Ca2+) the MVA-accelerated degradation of HMGal. These results suggest that Ca2+ plays a major role in the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "1": "Surgical specimens of 35 human brain tumors were examined with a novel monoclonal antibody, S-44, immunoreactive to statin, a nuclear protein specifically expressed in quiescent (noncycling) G0-phase cells. Benign tumors typically were statin positive with labeling indices (LI) between 22% and 96%: acoustic schwannomas (n = 3, mean = 29.9 +/- 19.4%); meningiomas (n = 4, mean = 59.0 +/- 15.1%); pituitary adenomas (n = 3, mean = 79.9 +/- 28.2%), and an epidermoid cyst (41.0%). By contrast, the statin LI of 18 of 24 (75%) malignant brain tumors was less than or equal to 2%: medulloblastomas (n = 7, mean = 0.3 +/- 0.2%); anaplastic astrocytomas (n = 3, mean = 1.6 +/- 2.7%); glioblastomas (n = 10, mean = 10.3 +/- 14.4%); metastatic carcinomas (n = 3, mean = 3.0 +/- 4.6); and a germinoma (0.2%). The vascular endothelium among diverse tumors typically was statin positive. All 21 tumors with a statin LI less than 10% were malignant, and all nine tumors with a statin LI greater than 40% were benign. The statin LI of benign tumors (n = 11, mean = 55.1 +/- 26.7%) was significantly higher than that of the malignant tumors (n = 24, mean = 5.2 +/- 10.5%, P less than 0.001). The absence of statin expression is a new way to determine the malignancy of human brain tumors. The statin LI may be useful to guide the prognosis and treatment of individual patients. The mechanisms that control statin expression are important in therapy seeking to shift the proliferating, cycling cells to the quiescent, G0 compartment.", 
    "2": "The effects of long-term dosing with inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase on the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis were examined in the lens and liver of rats and hamsters. While both pravastatin and lovastatin inhibited incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol in liver slices 2-4 hr after an oral dose, lovastatin, but not pravastatin, inhibited sterol synthesis in lens as well. At 24 hr after a single oral dose, cholesterol synthesis in livers from drug-treated animals was increased compared to controls. This induction of the cholesterol synthetic pathway was observed for both drugs in the liver but only for lovastatin in the lens. After 4 days of once-daily oral doses, synthesis in the lens was induced two to threefold by lovastatin but not by pravastatin. When the drug was included in the continuous diet for 4-5 days, lovastatin caused increases in cholesterol synthesis in the lens whereas lenses from pravastatin-treated animals were identical to controls. This was not a species-specific effect since a similar tissue selectivity was observed in the hamster. The increase in cholesterol synthesis in lenses observed in lovastatin-treated rats was accompanied by an increase in the activity of HMG-CoA reductase enzyme. These studies demonstrate that non-selective HMG-CoA reductase enzyme inhibitors can inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the lens, and following this inhibition a marked induction in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway develops in the lens and this induction is associated with an increase in HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity.", 
    "3": "Modification of the hexahydronaphthalene ring 5-position in simvastatin 2a via oxygenation and oxa replacement afforded two series of derivatives which were evaluated in vitro for inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and acutely in vivo for oral effectiveness as inhibitors of cholesterogenesis in the rat. Of the compounds selected for further biological evaluation, the 6 beta-methyl-5-oxa 10 and 5 alpha-hydroxy 16 derivatives of 3,4,4a,5-tetrahydro 2a, as well as, the 6 beta-epimer 14 of 16 proved orally active as hypocholesterolemic agents in cholestyramine-primed dogs. Subsequent acute oral metabolism studies in dogs demonstrated that compounds 14 and 16 evoke lower peak plasma drug activity and area-under-the-curve values than does compound 10 and led to the selection of 14 and 16 for toxicological evaluation.", 
    "4": "A general route for preparing side chain ether analogues of lovastatin is presented. These analogues proved to be weaker inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase than the corresponding side chain ester analogues. Interestingly, inhibitory potency was enhanced markedly when the 4-fluoro group was incorporated in the aromatic moiety of the side chain benzyl group of 2d.", 
    "5": "Two patients, a 64-year-old woman and a 40-year-old man, developed a lupuslike syndrome due to lovastatin therapy, confirmed by signs, symptoms, and positive fluorescent antinuclear antibodies are herein published. The lovastatin-induced lupus was completely reversible on withdrawal of the agent.", 
    "6": "The efficacy of lovastatin, an inhibitor of hepatic cholesterol synthesis in the prevention of cholesterol gallstone formation, was evaluated in the prairie dog model. Two groups of animals were maintained on either nonlithogenic or 1.2% cholesterol-enriched chow for 21 days. Seven of the animals in each group received lovastatin, and the remaining six received only distilled water. All of the cholesterol-fed/water-treated animals had crystals and 83% had gallstones, but none of the cholesterol-fed/lovastatin-treated animals had gallstones and only three had microscopic crystals. These data indicate that lovastatin inhibits cholesterol gallstone formation in a diet-induced model of gallstone disease.", 
    "7": "The long-term effects (66 weeks) of simvastatin (40 mg in one or two doses per day), an inhibitor of HMG CoA-reductase, were evaluated in 12 patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia (type III hyperlipoproteinaemia). Simvastatin had a persistent hypolipidaemic effect; the mean reduction in serum cholesterol was 36-51%, and the mean reduction in serum triglycerides was 32-55%. The decrease in serum lipids was caused by a decline in VLDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels; the mean ratio between VLDL-cholesterol and serum triglycerides decreased significantly from 1.06 to 0.73. There was no significant difference between the once-a-day and twice-a-day regimens. Simvastatin was well tolerated; no serious side-effects were observed. These data demonstrate the usefulness of simvastatin in the therapy of familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia.", 
    "8": "Cultured rat hepatocytes continually synthesize cholesterol form radiolabeled acetate during a 24 h incubation period and export it, presumably as VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) to the culture medium. Mevastatin inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis by 90%. Incubation of the cultures with water-soluble extracts of garlic powder (Kwai, Sapec) diminish cholesterol biosynthesis (20-25%) as well as its export into the medium (30-35%). The IC50-value is 90 micrograms/ml. Between about 0.25 and 10 mg/ml the average maximal inhibition amounts to about 23%. Cytotoxicity of the extracts is apparent at concentrations above 125 mg/ml only. Pure alliin alone, or after incubation with alliinase (conversion to allicin) in concentrations corresponding to its content in the extracts does not exert any inhibition. Replacement of 14C-acetate by 14C-mevalonate omits the inhibitory effect. The activity of HMGCoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA) reductase is significantly reduced by garlic extracts at 50 micrograms/ml. At higher concentrations fatty acid synthetase, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and cholesterol acyltransferase are slightly inhibited. Fatty acid synthetase is the only one of these enzymes which is inhibited by alliin at very high concentrations. These results demonstrate that water-soluble garlic extracts diminish hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis, thus contributing to the reduction of blood cholesterol. The main target site seems to be HMGCoA-reductase. The actual active principle(s) is still unknown. Alliin, however, does not seem to be of major significance.", 
    "9": "Previously, we reported that the isoprenoid pathway inhibitor, lovastatin, blocks the activation by IgE receptor cross-linking of 45Ca2+ influx, 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate production, secretion, and membrane changes (ruffling, spreading) in intact RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells. These results indicated that an isoprenoid pathway intermediate, very likely an isoprenylated protein, is importantly involved in the control of IgE receptor-mediated signal transduction. Here, we show that 20 h of pretreatment with lovastatin also inhibits antigen-induced secretion and membrane responses in streptolysin O-(SLO)-permeabilized cells. However, lovastatin does not inhibit secretion stimulated by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTP gamma S. Furthermore, the membrane responses to GTP gamma S persist, although in an attenuated form, in lovastatin-treated permeabilized cells. The relative insensitivity of GTP gamma S-induced responses to lovastatin was one of several indications that antigen and GTP gamma S may activate separate pathways leading to transmembrane responses in permeabilized cells. Further experiments showed that the beta-thio derivative of GDP, GDPBAS, inhibits the secretory and membrane responses to GTP gamma S, as expected for a GTP-binding protein-dependent signaling pathway, while having little effect on antigen-induced responses. Conversely, genistein blocks the secretory and membrane responses to antigen, as expected for a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway, without altering the GTP gamma S-induced responses. From these results, and from additional data from cells treated with tyrphostins and sodium orthovanadate, we propose that IgE receptor-mediated secretion from permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells occurs by a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway that requires isoprenoid pathway activity for function. We propose further that RBL-2H3 cells contain a separate GTP-binding protein-mediated signaling pathway whose direct activation by GTP gamma S is either independent of isoprenoid pathway activity or depends on the activity of an isoprenylated protein that is not significantly depleted after 20 h of lovastatin treatment.", 
    "10": "1. Dimethylsulfoxide-induced differentiated neuroblastoma express high levels of membrane 21 to 23-kDa carboxyl methylated proteins. Relationships among methylation, isoprenylation, and GTP binding in these proteins were investigated. Protein carboxyl methylation, protein isoprenylation, and [alpha-32P]GTP binding were determined in the electrophoretically separated proteins of cells labeled with the methylation precursor [methyl-3H]methionine or with an isoprenoid precursor [3H]mevalonate. 2. A broad band of GTP-binding proteins, which overlaps with the methylated 21 to 23-kDa proteins, was detected in [alpha-32P]GTP blot overlay assays. This band of proteins was separated in two-dimensional gels into nine methylated proteins, of which four bound GTP. 3. The carboxyl-methylated 21 to 23-kDa proteins incorporated [3H]mevalonate metabolites with characteristics of protein isoprenylation. The label was not removed by organic solvents or destroyed by hydroxylamine. Incorporation of radioactivity from [3H]mevalonate was enhanced when endogenous levels of mevalonate were reduced by lovastatin, an inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis. Lovastatin blocked methylation of the 21 to 23-kDa proteins as well (greater than 70%). 4. Methylthioadenosine, a methylation inhibitor, inhibited methylation of these proteins (greater than 80%) but did not affect their labeling by [3H]mevalonate. The results suggest that methylation of the 21 to 23-kDa proteins depends on, and is subsequent to, isoprenylation. The sequence of events may be similar to that known in ras proteins, i.e., carboxyl methylation of a C-terminal cysteine that is isoprenylated. 5. Lovastatin reduced the level of small GTP-binding proteins in the membranes and increased GTP binding in the cytosol. Methylthioadensoine blocked methylation without affecting GTP binding. 6. Thus, isoprenylation appears to precede methylation and to be important for membrane association, while methylation is not required for GTP binding or membrane association. The role of methylation remains to be determined but might be related to specific interactions of the small GTP-binding proteins with other proteins.", 
    "11": "In the multicenter, double-blind EXCEL (Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin) study the efficacy of lovastatin in modifying plasma lipids and lipoproteins in 8,245 participants with moderate primary hypercholesterolemia was evaluated. Patients were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of treatment with diet and placebo or diet and lovastatin 20 or 40 mg once a day, or 20 or 40 mg twice a day. At all of these dosages, lovastatin produced substantial dose-dependent reductions in low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels, averaging 24% (20 mg/day) to 40% (80 mg/day). The magnitude of the effect of this lipoprotein was further reflected by the percentage of patients who achieved National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) goals. In the absence of coronary artery disease (CAD) or two other CAD risk factors, the LDL-cholesterol goal of 4.14 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) was attained by 22% of patients in the placebo group and between 81% (20 mg/day) and 96% (80 mg/day) of those treated with lovastatin. For those with CAD or at least two other CAD risk factors, the LDL-cholesterol goal of 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) was attained by 4% of placebo patients and between 38% (20 mg/day) and 83% (80 mg/day) of those treated with lovastatin. Lovastatin also increased high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (7-10%) and decreased triglycerides (10-19%) in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, when used as an adjunct to a prudent diet, lovastatin produces favorable changes in the entire lipoprotein profile and is a highly effective agent for managing patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "12": "This randomized, double-blind, multicenter, diet-and-placebo-controlled study was designed to clarify the dose-response relationship of lovastatin therapy to lipid-modifying efficacy and drug-related adverse events. Exclusion criteria were minimized so that study patients were representative of the majority of patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia seen in medical practice. After 6 weeks on the American Heart Association Step 1 Diet, a total of 8,245 patients were randomly assigned to 48 weeks of treatment with diet and placebo or lovastatin at dosages of 20 or 40 mg once a day or 20 or 40 mg twice a day. All adverse events were monitored, with particular attention to evaluation of liver and muscle. Liver transaminase elevations suggestive of possible hepatotoxicity, defined as successive elevations in either aspartate transaminase or alanine aminotransferase greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal, occurred in equal numbers of placebo and lovastatin 20 mg/day treated patients (0.1%). The frequencies were higher in lovastatin 40 mg/day and 80 mg/day patient groups (0.9 and 1.5%, respectively). No patient was diagnosed as having clinically symptomatic hepatic dysfunction. Creatinine kinase (CK) elevations above the upper limit of normal occurred frequently in placebo- (29%), as well as lovastatin-treated patients (29-35%), and muscle symptoms were reported with similar frequency in all groups (7-9%). The combination of muscle symptoms with marked CK elevations (greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) was seen in only five patients: one in a 40 mg/day dose group and four in the 80 mg/day dose group. No patient developed rhabdomyolysis. The incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse events requiring discontinuation was 6% for the placebo group and from 7% (20 mg/day) to 9% (80 mg/day) for lovastatin treatment groups. No new types of adverse experiences related to lovastatin treatment were reported. Lovastatin, as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated LDL cholesterol, was generally very well tolerated.", 
    "13": "The new drug RG 12561 (I) is a lactone that is undergoing clinical evaluation for its cholesterol lowering effect based on potent HMG CoA reductase inhibitory activity displayed by its open hydroxy acid form. To determine the dispositional characteristics of the drug, a method was developed for determination of the two forms in plasma. A 0.25-ml aliquot of plasma was deproteinized with 0.5 ml of methanol, and the lactone was extracted with hexane-ethyl acetate (75:25, v/v). The methanolic plasma was then acidified followed by extraction of the hydroxy acid with hexane-ethyl acetate. The extracts were dried, reconstituted and analyzed by isocratic, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm. The separations were performed utilizing a C18 column with mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, 2-propanol and 0.1 M acetate buffer (pH 5), the proportions of which differed depending on the form of drug analyzed. The method was found to be selective and a quantitation limit of 50 ng/ml was established. Validation studies demonstrated that the method was sufficiently accurate and precise for determining disposition of the drug in the dog.", 
    "14": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is a key regulatory enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis and is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A fusion protein, HMGal, consisting of the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase fused to Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells from the SV40 promoter, was previously constructed and was found to respond to regulatory signals for degradation in a similar fashion to the intact HMG-CoA reductase. Degradation of both HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal in CHO cells was enhanced by addition of mevalonate or low density lipoprotein (LDL). In this report we show that 2 cysteine protease inhibitors, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN) and N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methioninal (ALLM), completely inhibit the mevalonate- or LDL-accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal and also block the basal degradation of these enzymes. It has been shown that in vitro these protease inhibitors inhibit the activities of Ca(2+)-dependent neutral proteases as well as lysosomal proteases, including cathepsin L, cathepsin b, and cathepsin D. However, the mevalonate-accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal is not affected by lysosomotropic agents, suggesting that the site of action of these inhibitor peptides in preventing the degradation is not the cathepsins. In brefeldin A-treated cells, where protein export from the ER is blocked, ALLN is still effective in inhibiting the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal. These results indicate the involvement of non-lysosomal Ca(2+)-dependent proteases in the basal and the accelerated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and HMGal. Enzymatic assays in vitro and immunoblot analyses have revealed calpain- and calpastatin-like proteins in CHO cells. The activities and the amount of these proteins do not change under conditions of enhanced degradation, indicating that the levels of these proteins are not subject to mevalonate regulation.", 
    "15": "We have reported previously that NB-598 competitively inhibits human squalene epoxidase and strongly inhibits cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate in cultured cells. Furthermore, multiple oral administration of NB-598 decreased serum cholesterol levels in dogs (Horie, M., Tsuchiya, Y., Hayashi, M., Iida, Y., Iwasawa, Y., Nagata, Y., Sawasaki, Y., Fukuzumi, H., Kitani, K., and Kamei, T. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 18075-18078). In the present study, the effects of NB-598 on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptor were examined using a human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. Incubation of Hep G2 cells with NB-598 for 18 h increased HMG-CoA reductase activity in a dose-dependent manner. However, the increase in activity induced by NB-598 was lower than that induced by L-654,969 (a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor), although NB-598 inhibited cholesterol synthesis more potently than L-654,969. On the other hand, HMG-CoA reductase mRNA was increased to the same extent by both inhibitors. These results demonstrate that NB-598 does not inhibit the synthesis of non-sterol derivative(s) of mevalonate, which regulate HMG-CoA reductase activity at the post-transcriptional level. NB-598 increased the binding of 125I-LDL to Hep G2 cells. LDL receptor mRNA was also induced by NB-598. In the presence of LDL or cycloheximide, NB-598 did not increase LDL receptor activity. These results demonstrate that the induction of LDL receptor activity by NB-598 is due to increases in mRNA and protein through the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis at the squalene epoxidase step. From these observations, squalene epoxidase inhibitor is expected to be highly effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and also is very useful as a research tool for studying the regulation of cholesterol metabolism.", 
    "16": "Treatment of 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (1), a potent regulator of cholesterol metabolism, with perchloric acid in methanol resulted in its partial isomerization to the beta,gamma-unsaturated 15-ketosterols, 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha,14 beta-cholest-8-en-15-one (2) and 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha,14 beta-cholest-7-en-15-one (3), which were easily separated from 1 by chromatography. Isomers 1, 2, and 3 could be distinguished by their chromatographic retention times as well as by their physical and spectral properties. Reduction of 2 with sodium borohydride gave 5 alpha,14 beta-cholest-8-ene-3 beta,15 beta-diol (4), for which the C-15 configuration was established from the lanthanide-induced shifts of its 3 beta-tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether. 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift differences between 2, 3, and 4 indicated the involvement of variable populations of conformers that differ in the flexible C-D ring system and in the side chain. Compounds 2, 3, and 4 lowered the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in CHO-K1 cells.", 
    "17": "Upon stimulation with antigen or antibodies directed at the CD3.T cell receptor complex, T lymphocytes undergo a series of biochemical events that result in DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. The purpose of the current study was to explore the role of mevalonic acid and its metabolites in this process. Stimulation of freshly isolated human T cells with immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) results in the induction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase message, with maximum induction occurring at 24 h of culture, approximately 12 h before the onset of DNA synthesis. Protein kinase C (PKC) probably mediates this induction, as H7, which inhibits PKC and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, but not HA1004, which inhibits all of these protein kinases except PKC, completely abrogates the appearance of HMG-CoA reductase message. The importance of HMG-CoA reductase induction and mevalonate production in cell cycle progression was demonstrated by the observation that either 25-hydroxycholesterol, which inhibits this induction, or lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, inhibited anti-CD3-induced T cell mitogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of lovastatin during the first 24-36 h of culture results in a progressive delay of cell cycle progression, whereas this agent, when present only for the first 12 h of culture, had no effect on T cell proliferation. These results suggest that mevalonate is required for cell cycle progression from mid-G1 into late G1. Exogenous mevalonate overcomes the antiproliferative effect of lovastatin but not of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Since 25-hydroxycholesterol suppresses the metabolism of mevalonic acid at multiple points, this result suggests that one or more metabolites of mevalonate, rather than mevalonate itself, plays an essential role in cell cycle progression. One metabolite of mevalonate, farnesol pyrophosphate, may play such a role, since free farnesol suppresses anti-CD3 mAb-induced T cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. In mAb is associated with PKC-dependent induction of HMG-CoA reductase which, in turn, leads to the generation of mevalonic acid and its metabolites, one or more of which play a requisite role in cell cycle progression.", 
    "18": "Thirteen heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemic patients were treated with lovastatin for 1 year, and were investigated for the effect on lipid profile, blood rheology and fibrinogen levels. A significant dose-dependent reduction in serum levels of total and LDL-cholesterol, Apo B and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol was noted. Improvement in red blood cell filterability and an increase in fibrinogen levels were also observed. We conclude that the hypocholesterolaemic effect of lovastatin in familial hypercholesterolaemia is accompanied by changes in blood rheology. While some of these haemorheological changes may be considered beneficial, others may be regarded as unfavourable. The net effect of lovastatin therapy on the coronary risk of familial hypercholesterolaemic patients warrants further investigation.", 
    "19": "Previous studies have shown that simvastatin, a hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, reduces plasma cholesterol levels when administered once a day. In the present study, the efficacy and tolerability of a morning and an evening dose were compared. The dosages employed were 2.5 and 5 mg for 12 weeks. This investigation was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 172 hyperlipidemic subjects whose plasma cholesterol levels were higher than 220 mg/dl. During the study period, mean changes in plasma cholesterol level (from baseline) were -11% with the 2.5-mg q.a.m. regimen, -15% with the 2.5-mg q.p.m. regimen, -14% with the 5-mg q.a.m. regimen, and -21% with the 5-mg q.p.m. regimen. Each of these changes was statistically significant when compared with that in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). In addition, the reduction in cholesterol level was significantly greater with the evening regimen than with the morning regimen for both the 2.5-mg (p less than 0.05) and the 5-mg (p less than 0.05) dosages. The changes in triglyceride and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in each group were not significantly different from those in the placebo group. There were no differences in the incidence of clinical adverse reactions among the various treatment groups. In conclusion, when simvastatin was administered orally once per day in the evening, it reduced cholesterol levels to a significantly greater degree than when it was given in the morning.", 
    "20": "This 16-week, double-blind study compared the efficacy and safety of pravastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, with probucol in the treatment of hyperlipidemia in 26 patients at the Instituto Nacional de Cardiolog\u00eda \"Ignacio Ch\u00e1vez\" in Mexico City. Patients had to have a low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level in the 75th (or greater) percentile for age and sex greater than 150 mg/ on 2 occasions, and a triglyceride level less than 350 mg/dl. The patients, aged 21 to 75 years, were randomly assigned to receive either pravastatin, 40 mg once daily at bedtime (n = 15), or probucol, 500 mg twice daily (n = 11). Complete lipid profiles were obtained at 4-week intervals. By the end of the study, mean changes in total cholesterol (CT) and LDL-C in the pravastatin group were -28% and -37%, respectively, p less than 0.001 vs baseline. In the pravastatin group, there was a mean increment in HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) of 9% and consequently a significant reduction in the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. However, in the probucol group HDL-C levels dropped -21%, p less than 0.01, and no significant change in the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was observed, accounting for the significant difference in LDL-C/HDL-C ratios between the 2 groups. Both drugs were well tolerated. One pravastatin patient discontinued because of adverse effects (nausea/vomiting and mild muscle pain). These results suggest that once daily administration of pravastatin is an effective therapy for hypercholesterolemia and that it produces a more favorable response in LDL-C/HDL-C ratio than probucol.", 
    "21": "Mevalonic acid is an important biochemical intermediate in cholesterol synthesis and other processes involved in cell replication. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is the enzyme which catalyzes mevalonic acid synthesis. To determine whether a potent competitive inhibitor of this enzyme, the drug simvastatin, may have an adverse effect on enterocyte cell replication and cholesterol metabolism, small intestinal biopsies from nine hypercholesterolemic subjects were obtained before and during treatment with simvastatin as a lipid-lowering agent. Histologic review of biopsies in a blinded manner detected no change in ratio of villous length to crypt length or in mitotic index which might indicate altered cell replication. Similarly, no significant change in measured activity of HMG-CoA reductase activity was observed. In spite of the high exposure of jejunal mucosal cells to this potent competitive inhibitor of a key enzyme, no adverse effect on growth could be detected.", 
    "22": "We used lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, to study the role of cholesterol synthesis in regulation of both bile acid synthesis, measured by release of 14CO2 from [26-14C]cholesterol, and biliary cholesterol secretion, measured by standard marked perfusion techniques, in humans. Six volunteers were studied in each of four periods: a) control; b) 6-10 hours after a single 40 mg oral dose of lovastatin to study acute effects; c) after 5-6 weeks of lovastatin 40 mg orally twice a day to study steady-state effects; and d) 24 h after cessation of chronic lovastatin. Mean bile acid synthesis fell to 69% of control (P less than 0.01) after single-dose lovastatin and remained at 83% of control after 5-6 weeks on lovastatin (P less than 0.05). After withdrawal of lovastatin, mean bile acid synthesis was 88% of control (NS). Mean biliary cholesterol secretion did not change after single-dose lovastatin (103% of control), but fell to 81% of control during chronic lovastatin treatment (P less than 0.05). After withdrawal of lovastatin, mean cholesterol secretion remained at 80% of control (P less than 0.05). These data suggest that in humans cholesterol synthesis is an immediate regulator of bile acid synthesis. Cholesterol synthesis also regulates biliary cholesterol secretion, but the effect is not immediate and therefore may be indirect.", 
    "23": "One hundred patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (total plasma cholesterol greater than or equal to 6.2 mmol/L [240 mg/dl]) were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel comparative study of simvastatin and pravastatin. All patients started or continued a standard lipid-lowering diet for at least six weeks prior to entry into the four-week placebo baseline period. Fifty patients received simvastatin and 50 patients received pravastatin, both at the recommended starting dose of 10 mg/day, for a treatment period of six weeks. Total cholesterol levels were reduced by 24% (from 7.59 mmol/L to 5.80 mmol/L) with simvastatin, and by 15% (from 7.48 mmol/L to 6.35 mmol/L) with pravastatin. Low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels were reduced by 33% and 22% and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased by 10% and 7% with simvastatin and pravastatin, respectively. Plasma total triglyceride levels were reduced by 12% with simvastatin and by 6% with pravastatin. Adverse experiences were similar between treatment groups and both drugs were well tolerated. No patients were withdrawn from the study due to clinical adverse experiences; one patient in the pravastatin group required a reduction in dose to 5 mg/day due to insomnia. At the recommended starting dose, simvastatin had a significantly greater lipid-lowering effect than pravastatin. These results may have implications for the appropriate lipid-reduction therapy for patients at risk of coronary heart disease.", 
    "24": "An extended-release osmotic dosage form was designed for gastrointestinal delivery of the water-soluble tromethamine salt of the beta-hydroxyacid form of simvastatin, a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and cholesterol lowering agent. The cholesterol lowering efficacy and systemic plasma drug levels resulting from peroral administration of this dosage form, relative to a powder-filled capsule oral bolus, were evaluated in dogs. A twofold improvement in cholesterol lowering efficacy was realized with the controlled-release dosage form that was accompanied by a drug AUC and Cmax that were 67 and 16%, respectively, of those achieved with the bolus dosage form. These results suggest that extended-release dosage forms have the potential for a dose-sparing advantage in the administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.",

Plasma LDL and urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 (an index of platelet activation in vivo) were determined at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months.

He had marked tendon xanthomas and mild dementia, with obvious electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities. He was treated for 2 years with CDCA alone (0.6 g/d) and then for a further year with the combination of pravastatin (10 mg/d) and CDCA (0.6 g/d). For the following year, he was given pravastatin alone, and then was returned to combined treatment again. The plasma cholestanol level before treatment was 3.12 mg/dL, which was 20 times above the control level. After CDCA alone, the plasma cholestanol was reduced to 1.96 mg/dL, and this was further reduced to 0.92 mg/dL by combination therapy with CDCA and pravastatin. However, after the discontinuation of CDCA, his cholestanol levels returned to the pretreatment levels despite the continuing of pravastatin treatment. When the combination therapy was restarted, his cholestanol level was once again markedly reduced. His clinical symptoms showed a close association with the plasma cholestanol level; the xanthomas regressed remarkably and the mental retardation improved in association with normalization of EEG findings during treatment with CDCA alone or in combination with pravastatin. However, during treatment with pravastatin alone, his tendon xanthomas enlarged again and slow waves reappeared on the EEG. Because inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor alone was not effective in causing a reduction of cholestanol, the increase in plasma cholestanol levels in CTX may not have been solely due to increased cholesterol synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "The enzyme 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase plays a critical role in regulating the production of cholesterol, dolichols, and ubiquinones in mammals. The inhibition of this enzyme in Schistosoma mansoni is accompanied by a cessation of egg production by the female parasite and a reduced ability of the parasite to properly glycoslyate their proteins. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that mevinolin, if given continuously over a period of 10-14 days, is a potent antischistosomal drug. In this paper, we describe the properties of purified HMG-CoA reductase from S. mansoni. Using affinity chromatography, we were able to obtain a 417-fold purification of the enzyme which had Km values similar to the rat enzyme for HMG-CoA and NADPH. The Ki value for mevinolin, a potent and selective inhibitor of the rat reductase (Ki = 0.6 nM), was significantly higher (Ki = 46 nM) for the schistosome enzyme. SDS-PAGE and HPLC of the purified enzyme resulted in the appearance of a single protein, which had a molecular weight (66,000) in the range reported for the rat enzyme. Parasite reductase activity, unlike that of its host, did not display a circadian rhythm. Furthermore, agents which elevate (cholestyramine) or decrease (cholesterol) mammalian reductase activity had no effect on the parasite enzyme. Our results suggest that the mechanism which regulates production of the parasite's enzyme may differ from its mammalian host.", 
    "33": "The specificity of mevinolin as an inhibitor of sterol and sesquiterpene metabolism in tobacco cell suspension cultures was examined. Exogenous mevinolin inhibited [14C]acetate, but not [3H]mevalonate incorporation into free sterols. In contrast, mevinolin inhibited the incorporation of both [14C]acetate and [3H]mevalonate into capsidiol, an extracellular sesquiterpene. Microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase was inhibited greater than 90% by microM mevinolin, while squalene synthetase was insensitive to even 600 microM mevinolin. Sesquiterpene cyclase, the first branch point enzyme specific for sesquiterpene biosynthesis, was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by mevinolin with a 50% reduction in activity at 100 microM. Kinetic analysis indicated that the mechanism for inhibition was complex with mevinolin acting as both a competitive and noncompetitive inhibitor. The results suggest that the mevinolin inhibition of [3H]mevalonate incorporation into extracellular sesquiterpenes can, in part, be attributed to a secondary, but specific, site of inhibition, the sesquiterpene cyclase.",

Hypertriglyceridemia secondary to reduced lipolytic activity is the most frequent alteration observed in hemodialytic patients (36.7% of cases). In addition, hemodialysis reduces the levels of lipoprotein in the blood whereas the atherogenic role of hyperlipemia does not appear to be as important as that of arterial hypertension and smoking.

Metabolites identified in plasma were 2,2-dimethylbutyric acid (DMB), 2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid (DMHB) and an open chain hydroxy acid of simvastatin: metabolites identified in urine were DMHB, a glucuronide and the glycine conjugate of DMB. They were characterized by gas chromatography/electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectrometry as phenacyl or pertrimethylsilylated derivatives.

    "38": "Pravastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which reduces plasma cholesterol levels by inhibiting de novo cholesterol synthesis and increasing the receptor-mediated catabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL). Several large multicentre placebo-controlled trials have shown that pravastatin reduces total and LDL-cholesterol levels in a dose-proportional manner in patients with familial or nonfamilial hypercholesterolaemia. Reductions in LDL-cholesterol levels reported in the largest study were 18% (10 mg/day), 23% (20 mg/day) and 31% (40 mg/day) after 12 weeks. Once-daily administration appears to be as effective as two daily doses. Pravastatin consistently increases HDL-cholesterol levels and decreases levels of total triglycerides but these changes are not dose dependent. At the study dosages used, the antihypercholesterolaemic effects of pravastatin were superior to those of bezafibrate and clinofibrate, and were similar to those of simvastatin, lovastatin, gemfibrozil and cholestyramine although in some studies a trend towards a superior effect with pravastatin was seen. Pravastatin did not reduce HDL-cholesterol like probucol, or increase triglyceride levels like cholestyramine. Combined treatment with pravastatin and cholestyramine or colestipol enhances the cholesterol-lowering effects of either drug administered alone and offsets the increase in total triglyceride levels seen with cholestyramine or colestipol therapy. Pravastatin is well tolerated during treatment of up to 24 months but longer term tolerability has not yet been established. The effect of provastatin on cardiovascular events related to elevated plasma cholesterol levels is under investation in several large scale regression and primary and secondary prevention trials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "39": "Synchronization of mammalian cells is essential for investigations involving cell proliferation. A simple method for obtaining synchrony in all types of cells, through several cycles and with minimal overall metabolic perturbations, has not yet been available. We describe a procedure for synchronizing normal as well as tumor cells reversibly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle using Lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. This method of synchronization was successful with all cell lines tested, including normal and tumor cells of mouse, hamster, and human origins. For example, when MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were synchronized with Lovastatin and released by the addition of mevalonic acid (the product of the reaction catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), 3 phases of accelerated thymidine incorporation into DNA corresponding to 3 S phases of the cell cycle occurred during a 90-h period of cell replication. Thymidine incorporation was decreased to less than or equal to 4% during the initial lag of 18 h before the first S phase, and maximum incorporation was then achieved after only 6 h. The antibody Ki-67, which detects a nuclear antigen associated with proliferation, was present in cells arrested with Lovastatin. This fact, together with the lack of thymidine incorporation during the initial lag time, indicates that the cells were arrested in the G1 and not in the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, in synchronized tumor-derived human breast epithelial cells, histone H4 RNA was low after Lovastatin release and increased with the onset of DNA synthesis. Concomitant synthesis of DNA and histone H4 RNA expression could be observed for 2 cycles. Minimal perturbations of general metabolic functions occurred since the rate of RNA, protein, and initial DNA synthesis were unaffected by Lovastatin, as evidenced by [3H]uridine, [3H]leucine, and initial [3H]thymidine incorporation. Finally, while the Lovastatin-induced synchronization was overcome by mevalonic acid, addition of squalene or cholesterol-ethanol had no such effect. Thus, Lovastatin appears to prevent formation of an early intermediate in the cholesterol pathway that is essential for progression of cells through early G1 phase.",

Biotransformation profiles of PV in pooled human urine, plasma, and feces from healthy male volunteers given single 19.2-mg oral or 9.9-mg iv doses of [14C]PV were determined by HPLC. The predominant drug-related component in urine, plasma, and feces corresponded to intact PV; in the pooled urine samples, PV constituted 29 and 69% of the radioactivity after the po and iv doses, respectively. The delta 4.5-3 alpha-hydroxy isomer of PV constituted 10% (po) and 2% (iv), and 6-epi-PV constituted 3% (po) and 1% (iv) of the urinary radioactivity. Negligible amounts of the lactones of PV or its isomers were detected in urine, plasma, or feces.

    "41": "rab3A is a small neuronal GTP-binding protein specifically localized to synaptic vesicles. Membrane-bound rab3A behaves like an intrinsic membrane protein in vitro, but reversibly dissociates from synaptic vesicles after exocytosis in vivo. Here we demonstrate that rab3A is attached to synaptic vesicle membranes by a carboxy-terminal Cys-X-Cys sequence that is posttranslationally modified. This modification is inhibited by compactin in a mevalonate-dependent manner, suggesting that the Cys-X-Cys sequence represents a novel polyisoprenylation sequence. Isolation of a rab3 homolog from D. melanogaster reveals high evolutionary conservation of rab3A, including its carboxy-terminal Cys-X-Cys sequence. The posttranslational modifications of soluble and membrane-bound rab3A are biochemically different, but both require the carboxy-terminal Cys-X-Cys sequence and are faithfully reproduced in nonneuronal cells. Our results suggest that the carboxy-terminal Cys-X-Cys sequence of rab3A is polyisoprenylated and is used as its regulatable membrane anchor. Furthermore, the hydrophobic modification of rab3A and its correct intracellular targeting to synaptic vesicles are independent, presumably consecutive events.", 
    "42": "Epidemiological observations, experimental and clinical researches have laid special stress on the importance of hypercholesterolemia in the natural development of the atherosclerotic disease and its cardiovascular complications. Primary and secondary trials have demonstrated the benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy to modify the evolution of atherosclerotic disease. In particular, it was observed a significant reduction of incidence and mortality due to coronary heart disease, that is the most common complication of atherosclerosis. At the present time, we have a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs which is able to inhibit the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase, the enzyme limiting the endogenous pathway of cholesterol synthesis. The HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, according to the chemical structure, can be divided into two groups. The first includes inactive lactone prodrugs, as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, that are enzymatically hydrolyzed to the corresponding ring-opened active forms in the liver, where the HMGCoA reductase inhibitors must chiefly reduce cholesterol synthesis. To the other group belongs the Pravastatin, a drug that is administered in its active open hydroxyacid form. Several clinical studies seem to demonstrate a greater cholesterol-lowering effect of the active form of Simvastatin, probably because of its more affinity for the HMGCoA reductase enzyme. Up to now, no inhibitor of HMGCoA reductase has showed serious toxic effects in man. The remarkable therapeutic efficacy showed by Simvastatin to reduce the serum concentrations of total and LDL-cholesterol, associated with moderate side-effects, ascribes to this molecule an important role in the therapeutic approach of familial and polygenic hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "43": "The HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin (statins) represent a new group of drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The present study was performed with simvastatin, the first statin introduced in Switzerland, and involved 46 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia during one year. The dose of simvastatin was adjusted according to the serum cholesterol level; during treatment with 10, 20 and 40 mg, total cholesterol was lowered by 18, 26 and 27% respectively and LDL cholesterol by 27, 38 and 35% respectively, after one year. A combination of 40 mg simvastatin with a bile acid sequestrant or a nicotinic acid derivative resulted in a cholesterol lowering of 38% and an LDL lowering of 48% respectively. The serum triglycerides decreased only at a dose of 10 mg. The changes in LDL and HDL cholesterol were accompanied by parallel alterations in apoprotein B and A1 concentrations. Although none of the patients showed a significant increase (greater than 3 x UNL) in serum ASAT, ALAT or CK, all these values increased slightly but significantly. Tolerance of the drug was otherwise excellent; gastrointestinal side effects were only rarely reported. Therefore, simvastatin is an effective and well tolerated cholesterol-lowering drug. Whether prevention of coronary heart disease is possible, however, is not yet proven.",

Phenolic derivatives of phenylalanine produced a similar inhibition of decarboxylase activity than that found in the presence of phenyl metabolites. The degree of inhibition was progressive with increasing concentrations of inhibitors (1.25-5.00 mM). Simultaneous supplementation of different metabolites in conditions similar to those in experimental phenylketonuria (0.25 mM each) produced a clear inhibition of liver decarboxylase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the in vitro inhibition of both liver regulatory enzymes of cholesterogenesis in phenylketonuria-like conditions. Our results show a lower inhibition of decarboxylase than that of reductase but suggest an important regulatory role of decarboxylase in cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "45": "A concentration dependent inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase was found on preincubation of microsomal preparations with diallyl disulfide, a component of garlic oil. This inhibited state was only partially reversed even with high concentrations of DTT. Glutathione, a naturally occurring reducing thiol agent, was ineffective. The substrate, HMG CoA, but not NADPH, was able to give partial protection for the DTT-dependent, but not glutathione-dependent activity. The garlic-derived diallyl disulfide is the most effective among the sulfides tested for inhibition of HMG CoA reductase. Formation of protein internal disulfides, inaccessible for reduction by thiol agents, but not of protein dimer, is likely to be the cause of this inactivation.",

    "49": "Increasing evidence shows the existence of nonproliferation-specific gene(s) whose expression is mostly present in growth-arrested cells. One member of this gene family has been identified by previous work as a nuclear protein of 57,000 Da, termed statin. Logical extensions of statin research are to identify the genomic and cDNA clones encoding for statin and to study the regulation of statin gene expression. During the search for the statin gene, we have identified a cDNA clone and a genomic clone named S1 and S10, respectively, by screening a rat brain lambda gt11 expression library with the statin antibody and subsequently using S1 cDNA as a probe to screen a rat genomic cosmid library. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of the S1 cDNA and S10 genomic clones. Primary sequence analyses indicate that the derived amino acid sequence of S1 shares high homology (greater than 92.6%) with human elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha), whereas the 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions are less than 20% homologous. Despite the unusually high degree of similarity between S1 and human EF-1 alpha at the amino acid sequence level, their protein products are different and immunologically distinct. The in vitro transcription and translation product of S1 (pS1), a 49,000-Da polypeptide, reacts only with the monoclonal antibody against statin; this antibody exhibits no antigenic reaction to the EF-1 alpha protein. Northern blot analysis shows that the S1 message is most abundant in G0 phase of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, but becomes significantly reduced in G1 and S phase cells. EF-1 alpha messages do not show such dramatic changes during cell cycle phase transition. These findings suggest that the expression of the identified S1 cDNA clone is specific for nonproliferating cells and that the in vitro translation product of the S1 cDNA is recognized by the statin antibody. Genomic Southern blots indicate that S1 cDNA is encoded by a single copy gene in the rat genome and is a unique member of the EF-1 alpha/S1 supermultigene family. DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that the rat S1 transcription unit is 12 kilobase pairs in length and contains seven introns. The organization of exons is virtually identical between S1 and human EF-1 alpha. In contrast, neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box is located in the proximal 5'-flanking regions from positions -1 to -1359 of the S1 gene, where we could expect to find the regulatory region containing the elements controlling gene expression; no evident sequence homology to the human EF-1 alpha gene is detected in this region.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "50": "CR200 cells, a compactin-resistant clone of mouse FM3A cells, overaccumulate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The elevated reductase activity is not regulated normally by low-density lipoprotein, mevalonate and 25-hydroxycholesterol. The amounts of reductase protein and mRNA were elevated in CR200 cells by 40- to 60-fold, as compared to those in parental FM3A cells and the rate of reductase transcription and the number of copies of reductase gene were increased in CR200 cells by 20- to 50-fold. In the parental cells, mevalonate and 25-hydroxycholesterol suppressed reductase transcription by greater than 90%, while that in the mutant cells was suppressed by only 20-50%, suggesting a regulatory alteration in the gene transcription in CR200 cells. When CR200 cells were grown for 10-20 weeks in the absence of compactin, levels of the gene amplification were reduced from approx. 50-fold to approx. 2-fold, along with a marked decrease in reductase activity and compactin-resistance of the cells. While the gene amplification was unstable, minute chromosomes were not seen in the cells and centrifugal fractionation and in situ analysis demonstrated that the amplified reductase gene was present on 2-3 chromosomes in the pseudotetraploidal CR200 cells having approx. 78 chromosomes. From these results it was concluded that the amplified reductase gene, which is responsible for overaccumulation of reductase, is located on chromosomes but is unstable in CR200 cells.", 
    "51": "We have previously identified statin, a nonproliferating-cell-specific nuclear protein of 57,000 dalton whose presence can be used to distinguish between growing and nongrowing cells. In this report we identify another protein, terminin, whose presence (by immunofluorescence microscopy) can be used to distinguish between temporarily and permanently growth-arrested cells. Thus terminin is a marker to separate the senescent from the quiescent state. By means of an unique monoclonal antibody (mAb1.2), the presence of terminin is recognized as granules in the cytoplasm of in vitro aged fibroblasts; these granules are not found in serum-starved, contact-inhibited, growing or transformed fibroblasts, except for those cells experiencing the initiation of apoptosis due to long-term deprivation of nutrients. Preliminary histochemical studies show that terminin is also found in the superficial epithelial layer of the esophagus, where terminal differentiation is followed by apoptosis and sloughing off into the lumen. Biochemical characterization by Western blot shows the terminin antibody recognizing a protein of 84 kilodalton (kDa) in growing and quiescent cells, whereas in senescent cells a protein of 57 kDa is recognized; this result suggests that a senescence-dependent protease may cleave the 84 kDa protein to 57 kDa. This proteolytic action seems to render the specific antigenic epitope exposed in its native state and accessible to the terminin antibody by immunofluorescence microscopy. It is this product of posttranslational modification in the form of a cytoplasmic 57 kDa protein that is the marker distinguishing between senescence and quiescence.",

The dose was increased to 20 mg and 40 mg at 6 and 12 weeks' follow-up respectively if the total cholesterol (TC) level was still above 5.17 mmol/l. Follow-up took place every 6 weeks and included lipid, haematological, biochemical and clinical evaluation. A full ophthalmological evaluation was conducted at baseline and at 24 weeks' follow-up. Overall the TC level was reduced below the baseline level by 34.3% at week 18 of follow-up and 32.5% at week 24. Patients with higher initial TC levels showed greater TC lowering in response to simvastatin than did those with lower initial TC levels. A group of 45 patients was followed up for an additional 12 weeks after the end of the trial and maintained TC reductions similar to those at the end of the trial. Fourteen patients experienced adverse effects which were thought to be drug-related. One patient was withdrawn from the trial after developing conjunctivitis that proved to be related to the use of simvastatin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "Prevention of restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) remains a major challenge. To determine whether lovastatin could prevent restenosis, between December 1987 and July 1988, a total of 157 patients undergoing successful PTCA were randomly and prospectively assigned to the lovastatin group or a control group. Seventy-nine patients received lovastatin (20 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was less than 300 mg/dl and 40 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was greater than or equal to 300 mg/dl) in addition to conventional therapy (lovastatin group). Seventy-eight patients received conventional therapy alone (control group). Fifty patients in the lovastatin group and 29 in the control group were evaluated with coronary angiography at an interval of 2 to 10 months (mean 4 months). The restenosis rate was evaluated according to the number of patients showing restenosis, the number of vessels restenosed, and the number of PTCA sites restenosed. Restenosis was defined as the presence of greater than 50% stenosis of the PTCA site. In the lovastatin group 6 of 50 patients (12%) had restenosis compared with 13 of 29 patients (44.4%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). When the number of vessels restenosed was considered, only 9 of 72 vessels (12.5%) restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 13 of 34 vessels (38.2%) in the control group (p less than 0.002). Similarly, 10 of 80 (12.5%) PTCA sites restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 15 of 36 (41.7%) in the control group (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (n = 12) were treated either with pravastatin, a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, or cholestyramine, followed by a period of combined treatment with both drugs. Initially, these patients had increased serum levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (8.77 +/- 0.48 mmol/l; SEM), lathosterol (5.32 +/- 0.60 mg/l), and ubiquinone (0.76 +/- 0.09 mg/l), while the serum dolichol concentration was in the normal range. Cholestyramine treatment (n = 6) decreased the levels of LDL cholesterol (-32%) and increased lathosterol (+125%), but did not change dolichol or ubiquinone levels in a significant manner. Pravastatin treatment (n = 6) decreased LDL cholesterol (-27%), lathosterol (-46%), and ubiquinone (-29%). In this case, the amount of dolichol in serum also showed a small but statistically insignificant decrease (-16%) after 12 weeks of treatment. Combined treatment with cholestyramine and pravastatin (n = 6) resulted in changes that were similar to, but less pronounced than, those observed during pravastatin treatment alone. In no case was the ratio between ubiquinone and LDL cholesterol reduced. Possible effects on hepatic cholesterol, ubiquinone, and dolichol concentrations were studied in untreated (n = 2), cholestyramine-treated (n = 2), and pravastatin-treated (n = 4) gallstone patients and no consistent changes could be observed. The results indicate that treatment with pravastatin in familial hypercholesterolemia decreases serum ubiquinone levels in proportion to the reduction in LDL cholesterol.", 
    "55": "Circulating concentrations of mevalonic acid (MVA) change in parallel with, and may be used as a marker of cholesterol biosynthesis. Plasma MVA levels have been quantified using a sensitive and specific capillary gas chromatography-electron capture mass spectrometric assay. The detection limit for MVA in plasma is 100 pg/ml; the intra-assay variation is 5.11%; the inter-assay variation is 7.7%. Using this assay, the mean plasma MVA in 15 normolipidemic subjects was 2.37 +/- 1.2 ng/ml (range 0.41-5.31 ng/ml). Administration of 40 mg of simvastatin (an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) significantly accenutated the diurnal decrease in plasma MVA levels. This assay may be useful in investigating cholesterol synthesis rates in different dyslipidemias and individual responses of HMG-CoA reductase-inhibiting drugs.", 
    "56": "1. Single oral 20 mg doses of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors pravastatin and lovastatin, with and without concomitant propranolol (40 mg twice daily), were administered to 16 healthy male subjects participating in a randomized, four-way crossover study. 2. Serum concentrations of total and active inhibitors were measured by bioassay and concentrations of pravastatin, two pravastatin metabolites and lovastatin acid were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. 3. Coadministration of propranolol with pravastatin reduced the mean area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of total inhibitors by 23%, of active inhibitors by 20% and of pravastatin by 16%. 4. Coadministration of propranolol with lovastatin also resulted in decreases in the mean serum AUC of total inhibitors by 18%, of active inhibitors by 12% and of lovastatin acid by 13%. 5. These decreases in systemic drug concentrations may reflect enhanced drug first-pass hepatic clearance in the presence of propranolol. 6. The clinical significance of these changes is likely to be small.", 
    "57": "The capability of pravastatin and lovastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors likely to be taken chronically for hypercholesterolemia, to cross the blood-brain barrier was investigated in normal male volunteers. Lovastatin, which is lipophilic, was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at concentrations that may have a pharmacologic effect. Pravastatin, which is hydrophilic, was not detected in CSF. It is concluded that pravastatin may have less potential for causing CNS-related side effects than lovastatin.", 
    "58": "Recent clinical evidence indicates a potential for skeletal muscle toxicity after therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (HMGRIs) in man. Although the incidence of drug-induced skeletal muscle toxicity is very low (0.1-0.2%) with monotherapy, it may increase following concomitant drug therapy with the immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A (CsA), and possibly with certain other hypolipidemic agents. In the Sprague-Dawley rat, very high, pharmacologically comparable dosages (150-1200 mg/kg/day) of structurally similar HMGRIs (lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin and L-647, 318) produced dose-related increases in the incidence and severity of skeletal muscle degeneration. Physical signs included inappetence, decreased activity, loss of body weight, localized alopecia and mortality. To evaluate the interaction between HMGRIs and CsA, a rat model of CsA-induced cholestasis was developed. In this 2-week model, the skeletal muscle toxicity of the HMGRIs was clearly potentiated by CsA (10 mg/kg/day). Doses of HMGRIs which did not produce skeletal muscle toxicity when given alone caused between 75 and 100% incidence of myopathy (very slight to marked skeletal muscle degeneration) when CsA was coadministered. Typical light microscopic changes included myofiber necrosis with interstitial edema and inflammatory infiltration in areas of acute injury. Histochemical characterization of the muscle lesion indicated that type 2B fibers (primarily glycolytic white fibers) were most sensitive to this toxicity but that, with prolonged administration, all fiber types were ultimately affected. Results of pharmacokinetic studies in rats treated with various HMGRIs +/- CsA indicated that coadministration of CsA alters the disposition of these compounds, resulting in increased systemic exposure (e.g., increased area under the plasma drug concentration vs. time curve-AUC) and consequent (up to 13-fold) increases in skeletal muscle drug levels. Evaluation of the potential interaction between the HMGRI, lovastatin and CsA at the level of hepatic microsomal metabolism indicated that CsA did not inhibit the metabolism of lovastatin in isolated microsomes from female rats. In light of the above findings, it appears that HMGRI-induced myopathy is a class effect in the rat, which is potentiated by CsA as the result of altered clearance and resultant increased tissue exposure. Cholestasis associated with CsA and HMGRIs may form the basis for decreased elimination and the resultant elevated systemic exposure. Furthermore, this toxicity is muscle fiber-selective and may be associated with impaired skeletal muscle energy metabolism.", 
    "59": "Preincubation of rat adrenocortical cells with lovastatin inhibits high density lipoprotein (HDL3) interaction with rat adrenocortical cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Lovastatin causes a decrease in the number of binding sites and a moderate increase in the affinity of HDL binding to cells. Lovastatin also produced a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in these cells. Dose-dependence, but not time-dependence, of the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, correlates with that of HDL binding (r = 0.91, P less than 0.004). Incubation of cells with lovastatin for up to 24 h does not change their free or total cholesterol content. The inhibitory effect was apparently not due to a modification of HDL by lovastatin. These results indicate that lovastatin causes a down-regulation of HDL binding sites on cultured rat adrenocortical cells.", 
    "60": "NB-598, a new inhibitor of mammalian squalene epoxidase, was found to be a potent inhibitor of microsomal squalene epoxidase from dog liver. Hypolipidemic effects of NB-598 were compared with those of simvastatin (MK-733, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor) in dogs. NB-598 was found to decrease serum total cholesterol levels and increase serum squalene levels in a dose-dependent manner. MK-733 decreased serum total cholesterol and squalene levels. Both NB-598 and MK-733 decreased all classes of lipoprotein cholesterol, and they decreased low density lipoprotein cholesterol most potently. Both drugs decreased phospholipid levels in parallel with cholesterol levels. NB-598 also decreased triacylglycerol levels. After termination of drug administration, these levels returned to the control levels. The potency of NB-598 is thought to be as great or greater than that of MK-733. Moreover, NB-598 increased squalene concentrations in the feces and gallbladder bile, but it did not affect neutral sterol and bile acid concentrations. NB-598 did not affect the lithogenic index.", 
    "61": "In 19 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), the effects of simvastatin (S) 20 mg/d, 40 mg/d, and 40 mg/d plus low-dose colestipol (10 g/d) on plasma lipids, plasma lipoproteins, and plasma lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity were investigated after an original dose-range escalation/descalation design. The drug regimen was changed every 8 weeks. A significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was observed, reaching 39% and 54% for the drug combination (week 28), and total apoprotein B and LDL-apoprotein B were reduced by 39% and 50%, respectively. Triglycerides were significantly lowered by S alone (up to 29% with 40 mg/d). HDL-cholesterol increased during therapy but the cholesterol content in HDL2-HDL3 fractions (isolated by ultracentrifugation) did not change significantly during the different steps. The ratio LDL-C/HDL-C fell by 57% at week 28. Plasma LCAT activity expressed as FER was significantly enhanced by S alone (+33%), and a further increase on drug combination regimen (+58%) was observed. This effect could be considered as a consequence of the increased fractional clearance of LDL-C. It tended to be sustained during the descalation part of the study. Biochemical adverse effects were scarce and transient. In conclusion, the combination therapy increased the plasma LCAT/FER activity without a preferential enhancement in HDL2-C concentration. This original design allowed to define the most appropriate individual cholesterol-lowering drug dosage in FH patients.", 
    "62": "The effect of lovastatin therapy on blood rheology was investigated in 26 hypercholesterolemic patients. Treatment with lovastatin was associated with a significant improvement in whole blood filtration time and a tendency toward normalization in red blood cell morphology. A significant increase was observed in fibrinogen level, in ADP-induced platelet aggregation, in the percentage of \"big\" platelets, and in platelet count. The viscosity of whole blood and plasma and the percentage of aggregated platelets did not change significantly. The cause for these hemorrheologic changes and their role in influencing the coronary risk of lovastatin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients should be further investigated.", 
    "63": "The effects of lovastatin treatment on density distribution and composition of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) were studied using a density gradient ultracentrifugation method in 35 hypercholesterolemic patients with severe peripheral vascular disease. Lovastatin caused a 32% mean reduction in LDL particle mass and a 36% reduction in LDL cholesterol. The cholesteryl ester to apolipoprotein (apo) B, free cholesterol to apo B, and phospholipid to apo B weight ratios in LDL decreased significantly during treatment (P less than .01, P less than .01, and P less than .001, respectively). The effect on plasma triglycerides (Tg) was not uniform. Plasma Tg levels decreased in 25 patients, but increased in 10 patients. Since plasma Tg level influences the LDL density distribution and composition, the patients were also subgrouped and analyzed according to change in plasma Tg. In those with increased plasma Tg, the light LDL particles were reduced more and the dense particles less compared with patients with decreased Tg. The mean Tg content of LDL increased (from 7.7% to 9.3%; P less than .05) and the weight ratio of core lipids (cholesteryl ester/Tg) in LDL decreased (from 4.57 to 3.44; P less than .01) in patients with increased plasma Tg during treatment. The results indicate that the change in plasma Tg (decrease or increase) determined the qualitative changes in LDL observed during lovastatin treatment.",

    "65": "Combined 3-methylglutaconic and 3-methylglutaric aciduria, one of the more common urinary organic acid abnormalities, has been observed in at least three clinical syndromes. We studied an additional seven patients with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, four of whom were best categorized as having the type II syndrome, two as having an \"unspecified\" syndrome, and one who may have had a primary urea cycle defect. In cultured cells and autopsy tissues derived from patients with the type II and unspecified syndromes, we were unsuccessful in identifying a defect in the leucine degradative pathway distal to 3-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway between 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase. Further assessment of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in several patients with one of the two types of disease also provided no defined abnormality. The primary metabolic defects in the type II and unspecified syndromes remain undefined.", 
    "66": "The pH dependence of steady-state parameters for aldehyde reduction and alcohol oxidation were determined in the human liver aldehyde reductase reaction. The maximum velocity of aldehyde reduction with NADPH or 3-acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (3-APADPH) was pH independent at low pH but decreased at high pH with a pK of 8.9-9.6. The V/K for both nucleotides decreased below a pK of 5.7-6.2, as did the pKi of competitive inhibitors NADP and ATP-ribose, suggesting that the 2'-phosphate of the nucleotide has to be deprotonated for binding to the enzyme. The pK of the 2'-phosphate of NADPH appears to be perturbed in the ternary complexes to 5.2-5.4. The V/K for NADPH, the V/K for 3-APADPH, and the pKi of ATP-ribose also decreased above a pK of 9-10, suggesting interaction of the 2'-phosphate of the nucleotide with a protonated base, perhaps lysine. Since protonation of a residue with a pK of 8 (evident in V/K for DL-glyceraldehyde and V/K for L-gulonate versus pH profiles) appears to be essential for aldehyde reduction, and deprotonation for alcohol oxidation, this residue appears to act as a general acid-base catalyst. An additional anion binding site with a pK of 9.94 facilitates the binding of carboxylic substrates such as D-glucuronate. With NADPH as the coenzyme the primary deuterium isotope effects on V and V/K for NADPH were close to unity and pH independent, suggesting that the hydride transfer step is not rate determining over the experimental pH range. With 3-APADPH as the coenzyme, the maximum velocity, relative to NADPH was three- to four-fold lower. Isotope effects on V, V/K for 3-APADPH, and V/K for D-glucuronate were pH independent and equal to 2.2-2.8, indicating that the chemical step of the reaction is relatively insensitive to pH. These data suggest that substrates bind to both the protonated and the deprotonated forms of the enzyme, though only the protonated enzyme catalyzes aldehyde reduction and the deprotonated enzyme catalyzes alcohol oxidation. On the basis of these results a scheme for the chemical mechanism of aldehyde reductase is postulated.", 
    "67": "IGF-I, when added to the TSH-primed FRTL-5 cells, induces a long lasting Ca2+ influx, and then, DNA synthesis. Moreover, Ca2+ channel agonist, B AY K8644 can mimic these effects on cell proliferation. We studied the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, Pravastatin on IGF-I-induced cell cycle progression in FRTL-5 cells. Pravastatin inhibited DNA synthesis induced both by IGF-I and by BAY K8644. In contrast, Ca2+ influx stimulated by IGF-I was unaffected. These data demonstrate that the signal transduction pathway evoked by IGF-I may possibly involve pravastatin-sensitive process at the downstream step of Ca2+ entry. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are known to modulate some cellular signal transduction systems by blocking the membrane attachment of low molecular weight GTP binding proteins such as p21ras. Therefore, pravastatin-sensitive process that we have shown here might possibly involve some of such small G protein.", 
    "68": "We have prepared antibodies that recognize isopentenyladenosine (i6A), a modified nucleoside derived from mevalonic acid (MVA). In immunoblot assays, affinity-purified anti-i6 A antibodies specifically bound to a 26-kDa protein (i6A26) in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Anti-i6A recognition of i6A26 was blocked with i6A but not adenosine or isopentenol. Employing immunoblot analysis we have quantitated the level of i6A26 in cells expressing various rates of DNA synthesis. The cellular content of i6A26 was reduced 4-fold in quiescent cells cultured in the absence of serum. When serum-deprived cells were stimulated to enter the cell cycle, the amount of i6A26 increased in the cells during the G1 phase. However, when synchronized cells were stimulated with serum-containing medium in the presence of mevinolin (an inhibitor of cellular MVA synthesis), we observed impaired G1 expression of i6A26 and delayed onset of S phase DNA synthesis. Mevinolin addition to asynchronously growing cells resulted in low rates of cellular DNA synthesis and suppressed levels of i6A26 which were reversed by coincubation with MVA. The ability of MVA to restore DNA synthesis and the cellular content of i6A26 in mevinolin-treated cells showed similar MVA concentration and time dependences. Regenerating liver tissue also exhibited elevated levels of i6A26. Thus, the expression of i6A26 correlates with cellular proliferation and growth. We speculate that i6A26 contains isopentenyladenine moieties and mediates isoprenoid regulation of DNA synthesis. Isopentenyladenylated proteins may also function in cytokinin regulation of proliferation and differentiation in plants.", 
    "69": "The U.S. pharmaceutical industry has been criticized because its products are perceived to be too expensive, yet prescription medicines remain the least expensive form of therapy. At this time, we are experiencing a dramatic increase in the risks and costs of pharmaceutical research and development (R&D). An example may be seen in the R&D history of lovastatin. The U.S. pharmaceutical industry continues to lead the world in the discovery and development of important new medicines because it assumes greater financial risk and invests more of its sales dollar in R&D than virtually any other industry. Where such a risk is posed, there must continue to be the potential for profits. Pharmaceutical companies must set responsible prices, must keep price increases down, and must help improve access to important medicines.", 
    "70": "A second cholesterol-derived metabolite in addition to 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol was observed to be produced from endogenous microsomal cholesterol in the presence of hamster liver microsomal fractions and NADPH, when analyzed by HPLC using the method of Ogishima and Okuda (Anal Biochem 158: 228-232, 1986). However, only 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol was produced in the presence of rat hepatic microsomal protein fractions and NADPH. The second metabolite was facilely produced when endogenous 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol was incubated with hamster liver microsomes and NADPH, but not with rat liver microsomes. The second metabolite derived from either endogenous cholesterol or exogenous 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol contained three hydroxyl groups as shown by mass spectrometric analysis. After oxidation of the 3 beta-ol group by cholesterol oxidase, the metabolite comigrated with 7 beta-hydroxycholest-3-one on normal phase HPLC, but was resolved from both 7 alpha- and 7 beta-hydroxycholest-3-one on reverse phase HPLC. The data indicate that the second metabolite is a hydroxylated product of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol, possibly cholest-5-ene-3 beta,7 alpha, 12 alpha-triol. Cholestyramine feeding increased production of both 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol and its metabolite from endogenous cholesterol by 3-fold in hamster liver microsomes in vitro. However, the direct conversion of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol to the metabolite by hamster liver microsomes was not increased appreciably after cholestyramine feeding (20-30%). The hydroxylation of 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol was similar in characteristics to cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in that it was dependent on NADPH, was inhibited by several known P450 inhibitors, and was affected by an inhibitory autobody elicited against rat hepatic NADPH: cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. 5,6- and 7,8-Benzoflavone were poor inhibitors (IC50 approximately 1 mM) of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in liver microsomes from cholestyramine-fed rats, but caused a striking enhancement of the 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity of liver microsomes from untreated rats in vitro. In contrast, 7,8-benzoflavone inhibited cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol hydroxylase activities of microsomes from normal and cholestyramine-fed hamsters. However, 5,6-benzoflavone stimulated cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity in liver microsomes from normal and cholestyramine-fed hamsters, but inhibited 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol hydroxylase activity by approximately 50%. These results suggest that hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol hydroxylase activities apparently involve multiple forms of cytochrome P450 in untreated and cholestyramine-treated hamsters.", 
    "71": "In the 2H3 subline of rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3), IgE receptor cross-linking stimulates a signal transduction pathway that leads to the secretion of histamine, serotonin, and other inflammatory mediators; the assembly of F-actin; and the transformation of the cell surface from a microvillous to a lamellar or ruffled architecture. We report here that 20 h incubation of RBL-2H3 cells with 10 microM lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase), inhibits both the secretory and morphologic responses to IgE receptor cross-linking. Ag-induced Ca2+ mobilization, determined from the influx and efflux of 45Ca2+, and Ag-induced 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate production are also inhibited in lovastatin-treated RBL-2H3 cells. Under the same conditions, lovastatin does not alter cell proliferation or IgE receptor expression, and it causes only a small impairment of responses initiated by drugs that bypass the earliest steps in the receptor-activated transduction pathway (ionomycin-induced secretion and PMA-induced membrane ruffling). Receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, secretion, and ruffling are all restored by 0.5- to 4-h incubation of lovastatin-treated cells with mevalonic acid, the product of HMG CoA reductase and the first committed intermediate of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. In contrast, dolichol and cholesterol, which are synthesized from products of the isoprenoid pathway, do not restore receptor-activated responses. These data implicate an isoprenoid pathway intermediate in an early step in the IgE receptor-activated signal-transduction sequence. We postulate that this intermediate is required for a newly described post-translational modification of proteins, their post-synthetic isoprenylation. The substrates for this modification include the ras family of GTP-binding proteins and the gamma subunits of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein.", 
    "72": "Sterols reduce the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) transcriptionally by inhibiting the synthesis of reductase mRNA and posttranscriptionally by accelerating degradation of the enzyme. We and others have described mutant lines of Chinese hamster fibroblasts that are completely resistant to sterol-mediated repression of transcription of HMG-CoA reductase as well as two other sterol-regulated genes, HMG-CoA synthase and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. In the current studies, we show that one line of sterol-resistant mutant cells (SRD-3 cells) retains the ability to slow the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase by 7-fold in response to treatment with compactin, an inhibitor of reductase that blocks sterol synthesis. The compactin effect is reversed by exogenous sterols. Similar results were obtained with another mutant line of sterol-resistant cells (SRD-2 cells) whose defective transcriptional regulation is attributable to a different gene than that in the SRD-3 cells, as determined by complementation analysis. These data indicate that the gene products that are defective in the SRD-3 and SRD-2 cells are not required for the sterol-mediated regulation of degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Thus, mammalian cells possess at least two genetically distinct mechanisms, one transcriptional and the other posttranscriptional, for sensing and responding to the intracellular level of sterols.", 
    "73": "A 48-year-old man had type IIb hyperlipoproteinaemia which could not be satisfactorily treated with diet alone (total cholesterol 351 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol 36 mg/dl, triglycerides 480 mg/dl). Treatment with lovastatin (an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) was then started at a dosage of 20 mg daily. After two months on the drug cholestatic jaundice developed (total bilirubin 6.15 mg/dl). The jaundice and abnormal biochemical findings regressed within two weeks of discontinuing lovastatin. All other possible causes of jaundice were excluded. These observations indicate that, in addition to hepatocellular damage, lovastatin may in rare instances also exert a cholestatic effect.", 
    "74": "Astroglia proliferate during brain growth, and can divide again later, particularly during astrogliosis. We investigated whether astroglia in primary cultures of newborn rat brain similarly achieve a state of prolonged quiescence which enables re-entry into the cell division cycle. In cultures after 2 months, cell number plateaued and there were sharp decreases in [3H]thymidine incorporation (70 +/- 5 vs 4 +/- 0.5 cpm/micrograms protein/h at 30 and 60 days, respectively) and in percentages of cell nuclei incorporating bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU) (from 46 +/- 6% to less than 1%). Replating at 10(4) cells/cm2 yielded secondary cultures which synthesized DNA actively. Forty-eight hours of serum deprivation at 2-3 days from subculturing, followed by addition of 10% serum (time 0), resulted in a return to quiescence which persisted until 12 h (G0 + G1). By 20 h (S phase), there were abrupt increases in DNA synthesis (5-fold) and in BrDU-labeled nuclei (from 19 +/- 2 to 76 +/- 8%) and the percentage of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells declined to 14 +/- 2%. Three days later, GFAP-positive cells numbered around 80%. Cell cycling after prolonged quiescence, in a manner similar to that in early astroglial cultures, required a non-sterol derivative of mevalonate in late G1. These data confirm that astroglia in primary cultures, like their counterparts in vivo, have a flexible capacity to enter and depart from quiescence, and most importantly, provide a system for examining regulation of this process.", 
    "75": "We examined the effect of a 16 week therapy with the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin in 29 patients (mean age 43 years) with primary hypercholesterolemia. All patients had cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dl (mean 348 +/- 96 mg/dl) inspite of a lipid lowering diet and a therapy with conventional lipid lowering drugs during a three month screening period. After 4 weeks on placebo 20 mg lovastatin was given orally for 4 weeks. If total cholesterol exceeded 200 mg/dl the dose of lovastatin was increased monthly by 20 mg up to the maximal dose of 80 mg/day. After 16 weeks lipid values changed compared with the placebo period: total-cholesterol -25%, triglycerides -8.6%, LDL-cholesterol -31%, APO B -25%, HDL-cholesterol +5.8%, APO AI +0.8%, total-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol -25%. There was a significant improvement of lipid parameters after lovastatin therapy compared with conventional lipid lowering drugs at the end of the screening period. Lovastatin was well tolerated. A small and reversible rise of transaminases and/or creatinine kinase was observed in 6 patients. Basal levels of ACTH in the morning increased significantly during lovastatin therapy within the normal range. This observation was more frequent in females (10/12) than in males (10/17).", 
    "76": "Post-translational modification of oncogenic p21ras proteins with farnesyl, a lipid intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis, is required for p21ras membrane association and for the ability of p21ras to transform cultured cells. We have tested the ability of lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, to inhibit the growth of ras oncogene-transformed cells in vivo. Balb/c mouse 3T3 cells, transfected with H-ras oncogene from human EJ bladder carcinoma, were highly tumorigenic in nude mice. Immunoprecipitation studies with transformed EJ cells showed that lovastatin (1-100 microM) inhibited p21ras membrane association in a concentration-dependent manner and that a 10 microM concentration reduced the amount of p21ras bound to the membrane by 50%. Lovastatin also inhibited EJ cell growth in a concentration range that closely paralleled that required for inhibition of p21ras membrane association. Treatment of nude mice bearing subcutaneous (s.c.) EJ tumors with lovastatin (50 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the abilities of these tumors to grow as early as four days and, by day 12, the lovastatin treated group of animals had tumors with an average size that was 3-fold smaller than those in the saline treated group. Western blotting studies showed that lovastatin (50 mg/kg) was also able to inhibit p21ras membrane association in EJ tumors implanted s.c. in nude mice. These results demonstrate that lovastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, inhibited in vivo tumor growth of H-ras oncogene transformed cells. The results also suggest that inhibition of p21ras membrane association, an essential step in ras oncogene neoplastic transformation, is one mechanism by which lovastatin may express its antitumor activity.", 
    "77": "The effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (lovastatin or simvastatin) and gemfibrozil treatment on low density lipoprotein (LDL) density distribution and composition were studied in male patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) (n = 17) or non-familial hypercholesterolaemia (non-FH) (n = 14). In FH patients the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduced 'light' LDL particles (density 1.022-1.033 g ml-1) significantly more than 'heavy' LDL (density 1.033-1.059 g ml-1), while a more uniform reduction of 'light' and 'heavy' LDL occurred in non-FH patients. HMG CoA reductase inhibitor treatment increased the apolipoprotein B (apoB) content and decreased the cholesterol/apoB ratio of LDL in FH patients. Gemfibrozil significantly reduced 'heavy' LDL but not the 'light' LDL fraction in both FH and non-FH patients, and the mean cholesteryl ester content of LDL increased, while the Tg content decreased, in both FH and non-FH patients. The results indicate that HMG CoA reductase inhibitor and gemfibrozil treatment have distinctly different effects on the physico-chemical properties of LDL, reflecting their different modes of action on lipoprotein metabolism.", 
    "78": "We examined the possibility that the cutaneous permeability barrier regulates epidermal DNA synthesis in two acute and two chronic models of barrier perturbation. In animals treated topically with acetone, DNA synthesis is increased 102%, in tape-stripped animals 127%, in essential fatty acid deficient animals 50%, and in animals chronically treated with topical lovastatin 64%. This linkage between disturbances in barrier function and increased DNA synthesis is further supported by specific and correlative observations: (a) in these disparate models, artificial replacement of the barrier with a water-impermeable membrane inhibits the expected increase in DNA synthesis; (b) the extent of the burst in DNA synthesis is proportional to the degree of barrier abrogation; (c) the inhibition of DNA synthesis by membranes is directly related to the degree of permeability of these occlusive membranes, i.e., the more impermeable the greater the degree of inhibition; (d) topical treatment with lipids that restore barrier function corrects the increase in DNA synthesis; and (e) barrier abrogation with acetone produces an increase in epidermal DNA synthesis without altering bulk protein synthetic rates in contrast to events known to follow injury or cell replacement. Autoradiographic studies show that the increase in DNA synthesis after acetone treatment is limited to the epidermal basal layer. This constellation of findings strongly suggests that cutaneous barrier function is one factor that regulates epidermal DNA synthesis.", 
    "79": "Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits aged three months (young group) or 10 months (adult group) received 10 mg/kg of simvastatin daily for 24 weeks. Serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and beta-lipoproteins were reduced significantly in the treated animals but not in untreated controls. The decreases were greater in the young than in the adult animals. Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not affected by treatment. At 24 weeks, the extent of atheromatous lesions on the thoracic-abdominal aorta was lower in the treated animals than in the controls, but the difference was significant only in the young animals. The results indicate that simvastatin would be effective in the treatment of atherosclerosis.", 
    "80": "The efficacy of once-daily versus twice-daily dosing of pravastatin was determined in men with primary hypercholesterolemia. The same group of patients was used in the two studies. In the once-daily study, 18 patients took 20 mg of pravastatin at bedtime for four weeks and then 40 mg of pravastatin for an additional four weeks. In the twice-daily study, 22 patients took 10 mg or 20 mg of pravastatin twice daily for four weeks. Total cholesterol was reduced 18% in the 20-mg once-daily group, 20% in the 10-mg twice-daily group, 23% in the 40-mg once-daily group, and 24% in the 20-mg twice-daily group; the respective reductions in low-density cholesterol were 27%, 28%, 32%, and 34%. All these reductions were statistically significant; no between-group differences were significant. Pravastatin was well tolerated and no patients dropped out because of side effects.", 
    "81": "Owing to the presence of hyperlipoproteinemia IIa, twelve patients without gallstones were treated daily with 20 mg, 40 mg and 80 mg of Lovastatin, each dose being administered for 4 weeks. At the conclusion of each 4-week treatment phase, bile was obtained from the fasting patient following injection of 5 micrograms ceruletid i.v. with the aid of a duodenal tube. The long nucleation time of bile was not shortened by the therapy. The bile cholesterol saturation index showed a decline with Lovastatin, which was particularly obvious in patients with an initially oversaturated bile. In contrast to other lipid-reducing agents (e.g. fibrates), Lovastatin does not lead to increased lithogenesis of the bile, but may in certain circumstances have an prophylactic effect against the formation of gallstones.", 
    "82": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, a new class of lipid-lowering agents being used with increasing frequency, inhibit synthesis of cholesterol in vivo. Thus, one potential side effect of these drugs is alteration of other metabolic pathways requiring intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. We hypothesized that pravastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, may impair vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin and alter mineral homeostasis by diminishing the availability of vitamin D precursors. Basal serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D3, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were measured, and dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D were calculated in a control hypercholesterolemic group and an experimental group treated with pravastatin 10, 20, and/or 40 mg orally twice daily for at least 3 months. Basal parameters of mineral metabolism were similar in the two groups. To assess the capacity of the skin to synthesize vitamin D3 and as an indirect measure of its precursors, all subjects received whole body ultraviolet irradiation (UVI) in a phototherapy chamber for varying time intervals. Subjects in both groups showed significant (P less than .001) dose-dependent increases in vitamin D3 production after equivalent UVI exposures. However, for equivalent UVI exposure, the serum vitamin D3 response was identical in controls versus pravastatin-treated subjects. We conclude that hypercholesterolemic patients have normal mineral metabolism and the use of pravastatin at these doses for up to 3 months does not alter vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin.", 
    "83": "The authors administered lovastatin (Mevacor, MSD) to 18 patients with primary hyperlipoproteinaemia (familial and non-familial) with a lipoprotein pattern type IIa and IIb. During treatment a marked reduction of atherogenic indicators of the lipid metabolism occurred, i.e. a decline of total cholesterol (-28.6%), LDL-cholesterol -39%), apolipoprotein B (-18.6%), the index of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (-44.6%) and the index LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (-48.2%). At the same time a favourable effect on indicators of the lipid metabolism to which a protective action is ascribed was recorded: a rise of HDL-cholesterol (+13.6%) and apolipoprotein AI (+13%) and AII (+13%). An excellent effect was observed also in four heterozygotes with familial hypercholesterolaemia which is usually rather resistant to other types of hypolipidaemic treatment. The drug was very well tolerated and subjective side-effects of treatment were minimal. Despite the fact that a number of laboratory indicators was followed up, the authors did not observe any undesirable side-effects, only a transient and marginal rise of ALT in one patient. Lovastatin is, due to its potent hypolipidaemic effect, a new hope in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Its usefulness in the prevention of ischaemic heart disease, as well as its safety during prolonged administration are tested at present in long-term investigations.", 
    "84": "To compare the effects of lovastatin and gemfibrozil in patients with primary hyperlipidemias.", 
    "85": "Forty patients with cholesterolemia over 200 mg/dl and triglyceridemia not higher than 350 mg/dl, excluded secondary causes, were selected. Twenty patients received lovastatin and 20 gemfibrozil. In order to establish the lipid profile, blood samples were taken after 2 months without medication, after 4 weeks of diet and placebo and after 6 and 12 weeks of active treatment. Biochemical profile was determined before and after the treatment with active drug.", 
    "86": "Thirty nine patients completed the study. Total and LDL-cholesterol were significantly reduced (p less than 0.05) by both drugs but lovastatin had greater effect. Only gemfibrozil reduced triglycerides significantly. Neither drug had significant effects on HDL-cholesterol. The tolerance was satisfactory; only one patient (using gemfibrozil) needed to stop the treatment due to gastrointestinal side effects. The biochemical profile did not present any significant alteration.", 
    "87": "Both drugs produced useful effects on the lipid profile. Lovastatin produced greater reductions of total and LDL-cholesterol, while gemfibrozil was more active reducing triglycerides. Neither drug changed significantly the HDL-cholesterol.", 
    "88": "A number of proteins have been identified whose expression or activity is regulated by cell growth. We have produced a monoclonal antibody against a new cell-growth regulated protein found in normal human fibroblasts. We have shown that this antibody recognizes a 51/52-kDa doublet (p51/52) found mainly in normal cells. This doublet is sensitive to degradation by the calcium-activated protease, calpain, breaking down to a 37/38-kDa doublet. The relative amount of the two members of the 51/52-kDa doublet changes when serum-starved cells reenter the cell cycle. Quiescent cells express mainly the 51-kDa form; the 52-kDa form becomes more abundant upon refeeding serum-starved cells. Transformed cells express either very small amounts of this doublet, and then predominantly the 52-kDa form, or no detectable amount of either form. These characteristics distinguish this molecule from several other known growth-regulated proteins such as statin and the anti-oncogene p53.", 
    "89": "Lovastatin (LOV), the drug recently introduced to treat hypercholesteremia, inhibits the synthesis of mevalonic acid. The effects of LOV on the cell cycle progression of the human bladder carcinoma T24 cell line expressing activated p21ras were investigated. At a concentration of 2-10 microM, LOV arrested cells in G1 and also prolonged--or arrested a minor fraction of cells in--the G2 phase of the cell cycle; at a concentration of 50 microM, LOV was cytotoxic. The cytostatic effects were reversed by addition of exogenous mevalonate. Cells arrested in the cycle by LOV were viable for up to 72 hr and did not show any changes in RNA or protein content or chromatin condensation, which would be typical of either unbalanced growth or deep quiescence. The expression of the proliferation-associated nuclear proteins Ki-67 and p105 in these cells was reduced by up to 72% and 74%, respectively, compared with exponentially growing control cells. After removal of LOV, the cells resumed progression through the cycle; they entered S phase asynchronously after a lag of approximately 6 hr. Because mevalonate is essential for the posttranslational modification (isoprenylation) of p21ras, which in turn allows this protein to become attached to the cell membrane, the data suggest that the LOV-induced G1 arrest may be a consequence of the loss of the signal transduction capacity of p21ras. Indeed, while exposure of cells to LOV had no effect on the cellular content of p21ras (detected immunocytochemically), it altered the intracellular location of this protein, causing its dissociation from the cell membrane and translocation toward the cytoplasm and nucleus. However, it is also possible that inhibition of isoprenylation of proteins other than p21ras (e.g., nuclear lamins) by LOV may be responsible for the observed suppression of growth of T24 cells.", 
    "90": "The costs and benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) were considered using lifetime lovastatin therapy as the intervention model for adults between 35 and 55 years of age. The analysis projected the benefits of CAD risk reduction using estimates from the Framingham Heart Study. The chosen analytic perspective was that of the patient. For average-risk men with total serum cholesterol levels between 5.69 and 9.83 mmol/liter (220 and 380 mg/dl), the cost per life-year saved ranged from $9,000 to $106,000, whereas for average-risk women, the cost ranged from $35,000 to $297,000 (1989 U.S. dollars). In high-risk men (with smoking habit and hypertension), the cost per life-year saved values ranged from 6,000 to $53,000, whereas in high-risk women the cost per life-year saved values ranged from $19,000 to $160,000. The results were more favorable than those found in previous studies of alternate medication therapies for hypercholesterolemia. Even using conservative parameter assumptions, at least 800,000 Americans aged 35 to 55 years are at sufficiently high risk for CAD, so that the net cost of lovastatin therapy can be favorably compared with other widely used medical interventions.", 
    "91": "The effect of simvastatin (MK-733), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on plasma triacylglycerol (TG) levels was studied in rats. Dietary administration of MK-733 (0.055%, w/w) for 7 days significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced plasma TG levels by 30.6% associated with a 44.3% significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in very low density lipoprotein TG (VLDL-TG) as compared to those in the concurrent control rats. Clofibrate (0.08%, w/w) also significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased plasma TG levels by 26.1%. MK-733 did not affect the triacylglycerol secretion rate (TGSR) during 0-1.5 hr after administration of Triton WR-1339, but reduced it by 33.9% during 1.5-3.0 hr. Clofibrate also decreased TGSR during 1.5-3.0 hr. MK-733 increased lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in epididymal adipose tissue and thigh muscle by 36.3 and 55.0% respectively. MK-733 significantly (P less than 0.05) increased LPL activity in the post-heparin plasma by 21.5%, although it did not affect hepatic triacylglycerol lipase (H-TGL) activity. Clofibrate did not affect LPL activity in the tissues or LPL and H-TGL activities in the post-heparin plasma. It is considered that the mechanism of plasma TG-lowering effect of MK-733 is the removal of VLDL-TG by an increase in LPL activity in the tissues as well as a decrease in the TGSR."
