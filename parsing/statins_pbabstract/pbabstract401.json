Schemes of treatment have now been reinforced by the appearance of new cholesterol reducing drugs. The objective of the study was to demonstrate efficacy and safety of a 10 mg daily dose of oral Pravastatin (a new 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA inhibitor) in a group of patients positive for hyperlipidemia, after 6 months of treatment. Twenty-five patients were included (14 men, 11 women) with an average age of 54 and 50 years, respectively. The main outcome measure was total cholesterol (T-CHOL), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TGL), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and adverse drug reactions report. Twenty-one out of 25 patients completed the study. T-CHOL diminished 21%, LDL-C was reduced by 28%, TGL decreased 6% and HDL-C increased 32%. No adverse reactions were observed throughout the study. Our study shows that the use of a low dose of Pravastatin satisfactorily reduced T-CHOL and LDL-C levels while significantly increasing HDL-C after 27 weeks of treatment, without untoward effects.", 
    "1": "Wistar rats received an hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, a halogenated pyrrole designated PD 123244-15, orally by gavage for 14 days at 10, 50, 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg. Doses of 150-600 mg/kg caused death and marked systemic toxicity involving stomach, esophagus, liver, gonads, lymphoid tissues, and skeletal muscle. Histopathologic findings included hyperkeratosis in esophagus and forestomach, increased hepatic mitotic activity, ovarian follicular necrosis, testicular atrophy and arrested spermatogenesis, and skeletal muscle necrosis and regeneration. Elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase correlated with muscle necrosis and hepatocellular damage. Marked systemic effects associated with high plasma concentrations were consistent with toxicity defined for other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, with the exception of pathologic alterations in the esophagus and ovaries. Direct mucosal irritation may have contributed to forestomach and esophageal lesions induced by this halogenated pyrrole.", 
    "2": "12 weeks of hypolipidemic therapy with lovastatin in patients with primary hyperlipoproteinemia phenotype IIa (20 persons) and IIb (10 persons), apart from decrease of serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentration caused significant decrease of antithrombin III, plasminogen and Factor VII activity. The mean decrease in antithrombin III activity (from 103.5 to 91.7% in HLP IIa and from 97.3 to 85.4% in HLP IIb) was significant in both groups, decrease of Factor VII activity (from 111.9 to 100.1%) was significant in HLP IIa and decrease of plasminogen (from 101.9 to 90.6%) in HLP IIb. There were no changes in fibrinogen concentration, prothrombin, Factor VIII activity and aPTT during treatment. Significant correlations of changes in blood lipids and changes in hemostatic factors after treatment were observed. The results of this study indicate that changes in blood lipids during hypolipidemic therapy are associated with significant changes in hemostatic factors.", 
    "3": "In this study lipid composition of lipoprotein fractions LDL, VLDL and HDL was determined in 30 men with primary hyperlipoproteinemia phenotype IIa and IIb during lovastatin treatment. After 12 weeks of treatment in VLDL and LDL fractions decrease of percentage of cholesterol content and increase percentage of protein content was observed. The percentage of esterified cholesterol decreased in VLDL fraction and increased in LDL fraction during treatment. In HLP IIa significant decrease of percentage cholesterol content in VLDL and LDL fraction was observed. In HLP IIb decrease of percentage cholesterol content in VLDL and increase in percentage triglyceride content was found. Esterified cholesterol percentage decreased in VLDL fraction in HLP IIa. Lipids to protein ratio decreased significantly during treatment in VLDL and LDL fraction. The results of this study indicate that hypolipidemic treatment with lovastatin is associated with changes in lipid composition of lipoproteins, mainly with the decrease of percentage cholesterol content.", 
    "4": "Serum cortisol and insulin concentrations were determined in 30 patients with primary hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) phenotype IIa (20 persons) and IIb (10 persons) during treatment with lovastatin. Lovastatin dosage varied from 20-80 mg daily. Serum insulin concentration did not change significantly after lovastatin treatment. Serum cortisol concentration significantly increased after 12 weeks of treatment. Cortisol concentration changes were different in HLP IIa and IIb patients. In HLP IIa cortisol concentration increased from 21.9 micrograms/dl to 28.1 micrograms/dl after 12 weeks of treatment, in HLP IIb cortisol level decreased from 31.3 to 24.1 micrograms/dl after 4 weeks of treatment and increased to 32.3 micrograms/dl after 12 weeks of therapy. Mean cortisol concentration was significantly higher in HLP IIa than HLP IIb patients. LDL-cholesterol concentrations changes after treatment correlated significantly with baseline cortisol concentration in HLP IIa group (r = -.34), changes in HDL-cholesterol concentration with baseline insulin levels in HLP IIb patients (r = -.54).", 
    "5": "30 male patients, aged 18-70 years, with primary hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) IIa (20 persons) and IIb (10 persons), with total serum cholesterol concentration above 6.5 mmol/l and triglyceride concentration below 3.9 mmol/l were treated with lovastatin for 12 weeks, after 4 weeks of wash-out and 4 weeks of placebo period. The lovastatin dosage varied from 20-80 mg daily. There were significant differences between groups in serum triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI concentration. After 12 weeks of treatment in patients with type IIa as well as with type IIb HPL significant decrease of total cholesterol (by 26.8% and by 33.6%, p < 0.001); LDL-cholesterol (by 39.1% and by 43.2%, p < 0.001); apolipoprotein B (by 22.9% and by 29.6%, p < 0.001) was found. Significant relationship between apolipoprotein B concentration and dosage of lovastatin was found. There were no differences in concentrations of HDL cholesterol and apolipoproteins AI and AII after treatment. The results of this study indicate that lovastatin efficiently decreases total and LDL-cholesterol concentration and apoprotein B level in patients with hypercholesterolemia as well as with hypercholesterolemia with mild hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "6": "An increased incidence of hyperlipidemia places kidney graft recipients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and may contribute to a decline in graft function. A study was undertaken to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lovastatin in these patients. Twelve kidney graft recipients with stable graft function and a cholesterol (chol) level over 250 mg/dl (6.46 mmol/l) were included. The lipid-lowering treatment consisted of 20 mg lovastatin daily, and all patients received immunosuppression with ciclosporin (CS) and prednisolone. Total chol decreased by 27% (300 +/- 56 to 219 +/- 28 mg/dl; 7.76 +/- 1.45 to 5.66 +/- 0.72 mmol/l; p < 0.01), LDL-chol by 35% (220 +/- 38 to 143 +/- 17 mg/dl; 5.69 +/- 0.98 to 3.70 +/- 0.44 mmol/l; p < 0.01) and triglycerides by 33% (207 +/- 127 to 138 +/- 56 mg/dl; 2.36 +/- 1.44 to 1.57 +/- 0.64 mmol/l; p < 0.05). HDL-chol increased by 10% (57 +/- 11 to 63 +/- 13 mg/dl; 1.47 +/- 0.28 to 1.63 +/- 0.34 mmol/l; NS). The ratio of total chol/HDL-chol, a generally accepted risk predictor of atherosclerosis, fell from 5.4 +/- 1.3 to 3.3 +/- 1.2, p < 0.01. Lipoprotein (a) [lp(a)], an independent risk predictor for atherosclerosis, was also evaluated at baseline and after 6 months of lovastatin treatment and showed a decrease of 39% (32.9 +/- 27.6 to 19.9 +/- 22.9 mg/dl; 0.85 +/- 0.71 to 0.51 +/- 0.59 mmol/l; p < 0.05). No adverse side effects were seen at this dosage, and hepatic and renal parameters remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Hyperlipidemia has turned out to be the most important risk factor for coronary heart disease and necessitates frequently lipid lowering long-term treatment. Therefore, efficacy and tolerability of hypolipemic drugs are of great interest. The objective of the present study was to compare the safety, tolerability and effect on plasma lipids of Lovastatin and Bezafibrate retard in patients with hypercholesterolemia. 99 patients with total cholesterol of > or = 250 mg/dl after a 4 week standard lipid-lowering diet were treated another 4 weeks with placebo and then randomized to 400 mg Bezafibrate retard or 20 to 80 mg Lovastatin given once a day for 12 weeks. Mean changes from baseline in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly reduced, in HDL cholesterol increased in both treatment-groups (p < or = 0.01). The effects of Lovastatin on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were more pronounced than those of Bezafibrate retard (p < or = 0.01), while Bezafibrate had a larger effect on triglycerides (p < or = 0.05). The frequency of clinical adverse experiences was low and similar among treatment groups, the frequency of laboratory adverse experiences was higher in the Lovastatin group. One patient in the Bezafibrate group was withdrawn because of nausea, one patient in the Lovastatin group because of GGT elevation.", 
    "8": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) inhibitory activity of pyridine- and pyrimidine-substituted 3,5-dihydroxyhept-6(E)-enoic acids and 7-(1H-pyrrol-3-yl)-substituted-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6(E)-enoic (-heptanoic) acids was quantitatively analysed using hydrophobicity, molar refractivity, electronic and Verloop's steric parameters. The results obtained were comparable to the earlier findings of 7-(aryl/biphenyl)-3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic (-heptanoic) acids. The R'4-substituent of the aryl substituent of heteroaryl moiety was found to influence the inhibitory activity through its steric and electronic properties, and the equations confirm that substituents with minimum steric bulk, positive polar and negative resonance constants lead to better inhibitory activity. The changes in the heteroaryl moiety of the inhibitors did not correlate with the activity. Probably, the heteroaryl moiety of the inhibitors may be serving as a skeletal framework to hold the surrounding hydrophobic substituents.", 
    "9": "The serum Lp(a) time course was studied in 100 male patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patients were randomized in a placebo (N = 50) and pravastatin treated (N = 50) group. The pravastatin regimen was 10 mg daily from the third postoperative day on and 20 mg daily after 1 week during 11 weeks. Lp(a) levels and serum lipids were analyzed at baseline, at 3 and 10 days, and at 4 and 12 weeks post-CABG. A decrease of serum Lp(a) levels at the third postoperative day was seen which parallels the changes noted with the other serum lipids when using extracorporeal circulation. In contrast with the other serum lipids, a slight but significant Lp(a) overshooting was noticed at day 10 followed by a decrease of the serum Lp(a) levels to preoperative levels 1 month after the acute event. The study clearly depicts that there is a significant time-dependent effect on the serum Lp(a) levels post-CABG and that there is no effect of treatment (pravastatin). The data also reveal that reliable postoperative Lp(a) measurements can be made at earliest 1 month post-CABG.", 
    "10": "The time course of the changes in serum lipid and lipoprotein levels have been studied in 100 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Marked decreases occur in the levels of cholesterol (-45%), HDL-cholesterol (-35%), LDL-cholesterol (-53%), Apo A1 (-43%) and Apo B (-43%) on the third day after the operation. In the control group the values gradually returned to preoperative levels which are reached after three months. Three months after the intervention, in the pravastatin-treated group (20 mg/day) the values of total cholesterol (-20%), LDL-cholesterol (-28%) and Apo B (-22%), remained significantly lower than in the control group (p 0.0001) and were lower over the whole duration of the study. The postoperative time course of HDL-cholesterol and Apo A1, however, was not significantly influenced by the administration of pravastatin.", 
    "11": "The concentration of lipoprotein (a) in plasma is under stringent genetic control and raised concentrations are strongly linked to coronary heart disease, in particular when low density lipoprotein levels are also increased. We serially monitored serum Lp(a) in 14 hypercholesterolemic patients who were treated with Pravastatin over a period of two years. C-reactive protein levels were also quantified to exclude a possible 'acute-phase' response as a reason for a sudden increase in the Lp(a) concentration. No significant changes were seen in mean Lp(a) levels after 24 months of therapy. Considerable fluctuations of serum Lp(a) levels occurred during the course of treatment. These were in some cases associated with raised C-reactive protein concentrations and might therefore be attributable to an 'acute-phase' response. We conclude that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Pravastatin has no long-lasting effects on Lp(a) levels in hypercholesterolemic patients suffering from coronary heart disease.", 
    "12": "In two simvastatin (SV) metabolites the 6' alpha-methyl of SV is oxidized to either 6' beta-CH2OH (I) or 6' beta-COOH (II). A possible intermediate is 6' exomethylene SV (III). When Sprague Dawley rats received an i.v. dose of [14C] III (1 mg/kg) metabolite II was excreted in bile. When dogs received an i.v. dose of [14C] III together with either [3H] SV (1 mg/kg) or its hydroxy acid form, [( 3H] SVA) (10 mg/kg), both 3H and 14C I and II were excreted in bile. These results strongly indicate that I and II are secondary metabolites of SV formed from III perhaps via a common aldehyde intermediate.", 
    "13": "After 15 weeks of simvastatin therapy (20 mg/day), low density lipoprotein particle size in sera of 16 patients with type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia increased significantly from 233 +/- 5.0 A to 237 +/- 7.0 A (P less than 0.05), analyzed by 2-16% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Under simvastatin therapy the concentrations of total cholesterol, total triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in serum fell significantly by 30%, 30%, 43%, 28%, 36% and 26%, respectively, and the concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol rose significantly by 14%. The changes of low density lipoprotein particle size induced by simvastatin therapy were correlated best with the changes of very low density lipoprotein triglyceride concentration (r2 = 0.438, P less than 0.01). Our results suggest that simvastatin therapy, additionally to a reduction of the serum cholesterol concentration, increases low density lipoprotein particle size which may contribute to reduction of the risk of coronary heart disease in patients with type IIb hyperlipoproteinemia.", 
    "14": "Treatment of mice and rats with the adrenal steroid, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), protects against spontaneous and chemically induced tumors. The mechanism of the chemopreventive action of DHEA, however, remains uncertain. DHEA has been reported to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. Mevalonic acid constitutes the basic precursor not only for cholesterol but also for a variety of nonsterol isoprenoids involved in cell growth. Certain of these nonsterol isoprenoids are utilized for posttranslational modification of proteins including p21ras. We therefore investigated the effects of DHEA upon protein isoprenylation. Twenty-four-h exposure of HT-29 SF human colonic adenocarcinoma cells to 50 microM DHEA was associated with significant incorporation of products of [3H]mevalonate metabolism into several size classes of cellular proteins. The pattern of incorporation was similar to that obtained after treatment with 25 microM lovastatin, a specific 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor. Very little incorporation of label from [3H]mevalonate was observed in untreated cells. This suggests that [3H]mevalonate gains entrance to isoprenylation sites after treatment with DHEA or lovastatin because of depletion of endogenous mevalonate and subsequent inhibition of protein isoprenylation. Isoprenylation plays a critical role in promoting the association of p21ras with the cell membrane. Posttranslational processing and membrane association of p21ras were both found to be inhibited by DHEA. Thus, it is possible that the inhibition of isoprenylation of p21ras and other cellular proteins by DHEA may contribute to its anti-cancer effects.", 
    "15": "In 1989 serum cholesterol was determined as a routine procedure in 534 consecutive patients. The response of the physicians to elevated cholesterol levels and factors associated with a treatment decision were analyzed. A follow-up was obtained in treated patients after at least one year. 105 patients (20%) had hypercholesterolemia, 84 of whom were available for evaluation; only in 34 (40%) was treatment initiated. Patients were more likely to be treated (p less than 0.05) if they had cholesterol greater than 1 mmol/l above normal, if they were between 41 and 50 years old, and if cholesterol had been determined at the physician's special request. The decision to treat was not influenced by sex, presence of further risk factors or by manifest atherosclerosis. After one year, 11 of 26 patients were still well controlled and treated. Their mean cholesterol level was significantly lower as compared to pretreatment levels. We conclude that initial as well as long-term management of patients with hypercholesterolemia should be improved.", 
    "16": "Vigorous physical activity and lovastatin (Mevacor) a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, have both been independently associated with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. To determine the effect of lovastatin plus exercise on serum CK activity, we measured CK levels before and after maximal treadmill exercise in 14 men (51.6 +/- 17.3 years, mean +/- SD) and 6 women (48.5 +/- 7.4 years) before and after 4 weeks of lovastatin treatment (20 mg/d). Blood samples were obtained before, immediately after, and 24 hours after exercise. Individual subjects were exercised for the same duration on each test. Preexercise CK levels and the average CK response to treadmill exercise did not differ before and after lovastatin treatment. In two men taking lovastatin, however, CK levels increased by 183% and 242% 24 hours after exercise during lovastatin administration. We conclude that low-dose lovastatin treatment plus exercise does not affect average CK activity but that this combination may markedly increase CK levels in certain individuals.", 
    "17": "We undertook this study to determine the effect of rumenectomy (a known cause of duodenal crypt cell hyperplasia) on the epithelial growth kinetics of the crypt-villus axis in rat duodenum. Ten rats were randomly assigned to control (gastrotomy) and experimental (rumenectomy) groups. After 14 days rats were sacrificed and representative sections were stained with the monoclonal antibody to statin, a non-proliferation-specific protein, by the immunoperoxidase procedure. In the control group, the mean percentages of statin-positive cells in the proximal duodenum, distal duodenum, proximal jejunum, and distal jejunum were 79 +/- 8.5, 79.5 +/- 5.7, 85 +/- 1.4, and 83.5 +/- 0.7, respectively. In the rumenectomy group, statin-positive nuclei were found in the region of the villous apices only, and the corresponding values for the above four areas were 26.2 +/- 4.9, 24.5 +/- 3.5, 31.7 +/- 4.5, and 80.5 +/- 2.1. Except for distal jejunum, the differences in statin expression in the control and experimental groups were significant (p less than 0.001). Rumenectomy leads to the disappearance of statin from the villous column cells of the duodenum and proximal small bowel. The lack of expression of statin in the rumenectomy group documents the potential usefulness of this measure in future studies in neoplasia were understanding of the proliferative status is of crucial importance.", 
    "18": "In this preliminary study, the levels of urinary 6 beta-hydroxycortisol and urinary free cortisol and the 6 beta-hydroxycortisol/free cortisol ratio were determined in normal volunteers and in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia before and after Pravastatin administration (10 mg/d for 2 weeks). Urinary 6 beta-hydroxycortisol and 6 beta-hydroxycortisol/free cortisol ratio increased significantly in both groups after Pravastatin administration (P less than 0.05). The percent increase of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol/free cortisol did not differ significantly when the two groups were compared. Our preliminary results suggest that Pravastatin induces hepatic microsomal 6 beta-hydroxylase both in normal volunteers and in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "19": "We investigated the effects of lovastatin, cholestyramine, and dietary sterol restriction on cholesterol synthesis and low density lipoprotein receptor function in freshly isolated mononuclear leukocytes from two unrelated sitosterolemic families. Total plasma sterol concentrations were elevated in the two homozygous sitosterolemic subjects (343 and 301 vs. 185 mg/dl in controls) and contained increased amounts of plant sterols and 5 alpha-saturated stanols (20% and 8% vs. less than 1% in controls), but were not significantly different from controls in the two heterozygous subjects. The rates of conversion of acetate to cholesterol by mononuclear leukocytes were subnormal in all homozygous and heterozygous subjects and correlated with markedly reduced microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity. In the two homozygous subjects, cholestyramine treatment decreased plasma sterols 29% and 35%, and yet was associated with a paradoxical decline in mononuclear leukocyte HMG-CoA reductase activity. In contrast, plasma sterol concentrations decreased 14% and 5%, and mononuclear leukocyte HMG-CoA reductase activities increased 13% and 46% in three control and one heterozygous subjects treated with cholestyramine, respectively. Plasma sterol concentrations in the homozygous subjects unexpectedly failed to decline during treatment with lovastatin or a low sterol diet. In distinction, plasma sterol concentrations in three control and one heterozygous subjects dropped 28% and 31%, respectively, during treatment with lovastatin. Both cholestyramine and low dietary sterols stimulated low density lipoprotein receptor function. These results demonstrate a marked abnormality in cholesterol homeostasis in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia with xanthomatosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "Therapy for hypercholesterolemia has been shown to reduce the risk for coronary heart disease in middle-aged men. Current guidelines for detecting and treating hypercholesterolemia in adults render large numbers of elderly patients eligible for medical intervention. The elderly are a heterogeneous group of individuals who differ widely in their ability to function physically, behaviorally, cognitively and emotionally. Not all elderly patients qualify for cholesterol-lowering therapy. Decisions regarding diagnostic and therapeutic interventions should be based on the physiological age of the patient rather than the chronological age, and on the presence and severity of concomitant disease, mental status and cognitive ability, as well as on the patient's expectations from medical care. Suggestions for dietary therapy and drug therapy in the elderly are provided. The objectives and potential benefits of therapy are described. Based on the information currently available, it is concluded that the elderly are likely to benefit from cardiovascular risk factor modification and should not be denied cholesterol-lowering therapy simply on the basis of their chronological age.", 
    "21": "The efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin and gemfibrozil were compared in a randomized double-blind 12-week study including 182 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, from 7 hospitals in Spain. Inclusion criteria were total-cholesterol of at least 250 mg/dl and triglycerides less than 350 mg/dl. Patients were stratified in two groups: group 1, cholesterol less than 300 mg/dl, and group II, cholesterol equal to or more than 300 mg/dl. Patients were randomized to gemfibrozil (600 mg b.i.d.) or lovastatin (20 mg q.p.m., group I and 40 mg q.p.m., group II). If after 6 weeks of treatment cholesterol remained above 200 mg/dl, lovastatin does were doubled. In group I, lovastatin decreased cholesterol by 20%, LDL-C by 28%, and triglycerides by 17%, and increased HDL-C by 8%. In group II the results were: -26%, -33%, -19% and +6% respectively. The corresponding results with gemfibrozil were: -8%, -9%, -28% and +14% (group I); and -13%, -14%, -33% and +9% (group II). In both groups, lovastatin was more effective in reducing cholesterol and LDL-C (P less than 0.001) and gemfibrozil in reducing triglycerides (P less than 0.05 group I and P less than 0.01 group II). Both drugs were well tolerated. Thus, lovastatin and gemfibrozil are effective lipid-lowering agents; lovastatin has more pronounced effects in patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "22": "This study compares the effects of fenofibrate and simvastatin in primary hypercholesterolemia, with particular regard to lipoprotein particles, as defined by their apolipoprotein composition: LpAI, LpAII: AI, LpE:B, LpCIII:B. This was a double-blind study in which patients were randomized to 2 groups, one receiving simvastatin 20 mg once daily and the other receiving fenofibrate 200 mg b.i.d., if their total cholesterol and their LDL cholesterol remained above 7.60 mmol/l (300 mg/dl) and 4.95 mmol/l (195 mg/dl) after a 4-week placebo period. Simvastatin dosage was doubled at the end of 6 weeks of therapy if the LDL-cholesterol level remained above 3.55 mmol/l (140 mg/dl). Analyses were done after 6 and 10 weeks of therapy. Apolipoprotein AI was increased significantly only at week 10 with fenofibrate (+7.4%). Simvastatin had a more pronounced effect than fenofibrate on apolipoprotein B. There was a significant difference between drugs at weeks 6 and 10. No change was observed in the LpAII:AI level with simvastatin, whereas fenofibrate increased these particles quite significantly (+13.9 and +22.3%). The drugs had opposite effects on LpAI (+2.5 and +5.6% with simvastatin; -12.8 and -15.1% with fenofibrate). LP E:B (-33.0 and -40.8% with simvastatin; -53.8 and -52.2% with fenofibrate) and LpCIII:B (-23.8 and -31.8% with simvastatin; -35.1 and -43.5% with fenofibrate) were decreased by both drugs, but fenofibrate was significantly more effective in reducing these particles than simvastatin at week 6. This study suggests that both drugs led to different structural modifications of the lipoproteins, which would not be revealed by total apolipoprotein analysis. These differences are probably related to the mechanisms of action of these drugs.", 
    "23": "The 3-years efficacy and safety of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin (S) (previously called synvinolin or MK-733) has been studied in single and combined therapy with cholestyramine (C) in 48 hypercholesterolaemic patients. Plasma lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins A-I and B, and blood safety tests (haematology, liver function, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatinine, blood glucose and thyroid function) were determined regularly throughout the study. Extensive ophthalmological examinations with particular focus on the lens were done before initiation of therapy and at every 6 months during drug treatment. Maximal reductions of mean plasma total cholesterol concentration (34% with S; 47% with S + C) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentration (42% with S; 56% with S + C) were achieved after 4 weeks on full-dose therapy. During continued treatment, years 1 through 3, the reduction of mean plasma total cholesterol was 26-29% with S alone, and 31-41% with S + C. Significant reductions of plasma triglycerides (15-27%) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides (10-27%) were achieved in the group treated with S as single therapy. In this group there was also a significant increase (10-14%) of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. In liver aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferases, as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), minor and variable, but usually transient, increases were seen. Repeated ophthalmological examinations did not demonstrate any drug-related side effects. It is concluded that simvastatin is a safe and efficient cholesterol-lowering drug for long-term therapy, both as a single drug and in combination with cholestyramine.", 
    "24": "In a contribution to a prolonged multicenter study 15 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were treated with simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. The first part of the study was done in a double-blind fashion comparing the effect of this new drug with that of gemfibrozil during 12 weeks, and after this period on open-label treatment was started with the administration to all the patients of simvastatin in doses ranging from 2.5 to 40 mg q.p.m. Persistent and significant reductions (P less than 0.001) were achieved for total serum cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apo B and triglycerides: by 38, 49, 44 and 33%, respectively, after 40 weeks of the open-label extension. From week 12, LDL-C levels were maintained at a cut point less than or equal to 140 mg/dl in every patient throughout the study. At week 40, cholesterol values of HDL subfractions showed a significant increase in HDL2-C (28%, P less than 0.01) and a concomitant reduction in HDL3-C (12%, P less than 0.01) in spite of a nonsignificant elevation of total HDL-C (by 6%). The HDL2-C/HDL3-C ratio rose by 47% (P less than 0.001) and the TC/HDL-C ratio was significantly reduced by 43%: from 6.1 +/- 1.2 to 3.5 +/- 0.7 (mean +/- SD, P less than 0.001). No adverse effects were detected. Our results suggest a conversion of HDL3 into HDL2, which could imply a beneficial effect of simvastatin upon the so-called reverse cholesterol transport, in addition to the striking reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins.", 
    "25": "The effect of gemfibrozil treatment (900 mg/day) on serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, apoproteins A-I, A-II and B as well as HMG-CoA reductase in mononuclear cells was studied in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia types IIa and IIb. After 4 weeks of treatment gemfibrozil reduced total serum cholesterol (IIa: -17%, IIb: -26%), triglyceride (IIa: -39%, IIb: -47%) and apoprotein B (IIa: -22%, IIb: -15%). HDL cholesterol was increased by 20-22% and apoproteins A-I and A-II by 4-11%. Concomitantly, HMG-CoA reductase activity in freshly isolated mononuclear cells was suppressed by 78% in type IIa and 51% in type IIb patients. Continuation of treatment for up to 16 weeks prompted a further decline to 8 and 5% of the initial values, respectively. However, gemfibrozil failed to affect HMG-CoA reductase directly in homogenized or cultured mononuclear cells and did not further promote the suppressive action of LDL when added to the culture medium. Similarly, preincubation with the drug did not significantly modulate the binding or degradation of LDL in the cultured cells. However, LDL from patients with hyperlipoproteinemia types IIa and IIb exhibited enhanced binding and more potent HMG-CoA reductase suppression when isolated after compared to before gemfibrozil treatment. It is suggested that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibition observed in mononuclear cells during gemfibrozil treatment is due to changes in LDL structure affecting LDL receptor binding rather than direct effects of the drug on cellular cholesterol metabolism.", 
    "26": "Twenty-two patients with pronounced hypercholesterolaemia were treated with simvastatin in increasing doses, i.e. 10, 20 and 40 mg O.D. Each treatment regimen had a duration of 6 weeks. In addition to the expected low density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering effect, simvastatin altered the plasma HDL particle size spectrum by selective elevation of the plasma HDL2b and HDL3a levels, as defined by polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (gge). While the reduction in LDL cholesterol by simvastatin was dose dependent, the effect on HDL was maximal already at 10 mg daily. On treatment with simvastatin 10 mg O.D., the plasma HDL2b and HDL3a concentrations increased by 30% (P less than 0.001) and 12% (P less than 0.01) respectively. On the corresponding treatment with simvastatin LDL cholesterol decreased by 31% (P less than 0.001). The very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol to triglyceride ratio was significantly lowered by treatment with 10 mg simvastatin O.D. suggesting a compositional change in VLDL. Positive univariate correlations between treatment-induced decreases in plasma HDL3b/3c levels and VLDL triglyceride concentration were seen. It is suggested that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in hypercholesterolaemic subjects by simvastatin treatment alters the composition of VLDL, which may affect the close relation between HDL and VLDL, in turn producing selective elevations of the plasma HDL2b and HDL3a levels.", 
    "27": "The effects on sleep of two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (40 mg lovastatin and 40 mg pravastatin) were evaluated in 12 normal subjects in a double-blind placebo-controlled sleep laboratory study. Subjects were randomly assigned to each of two parallel groups (lovastatin and pravastatin). Each parallel-group protocol consisted of 22 consecutive nights including 4 placebo-baseline nights, 2 weeks of drug administration, and 4 placebo-withdrawal nights. Lovastatin did not disturb sleep initially (nights 5 through 7) but, with continued administration (nights 16 through 18), it significantly and markedly increased wake time after sleep onset and stage 1 sleep compared with baseline. By contrast, pravastatin was not associated with sleep disturbance either initially or with continued use. Neither drug caused any sleep disturbance after withdrawal. Lovastatin's sleep disturbing effects with continued administration are attributed to its high degree of lipophilicity in contrast with the hydrophilicity of pravastatin.", 
    "28": "Recent clinical trials of primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease have demonstrated that lowering plasma cholesterol decreases the incidence of coronary heart disease in patients with elevated plasma cholesterol. However, it is not known whether patients with established coronary artery disease and normal plasma cholesterol can be benefited. Several previous prevention trials reviewed in this report found that patients who had plasma cholesterol levels at baseline in the upper portion of the eligibility range (e.g., greater than 240 mg/dl) received greater benefit from hypolipidemic diet or drug therapy than patients who had lower plasma cholesterol levels at baseline. The recent availability of drugs that are more potent and less prone to cause adverse reactions than previous regimens permits this important question to be addressed. The Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial is testing whether pravastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, will decrease the sum of fatal coronary heart disease and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) in patients who have recovered from a MI and who have normal total cholesterol levels. Fatal cardiovascular disease and total mortality are important secondary end points. The trial is enrolling 4,000 men and women from 80 centers throughout North America, age 21 to 75 years, who have survived MI for 3 to 20 months, who have plasma total cholesterol less than 240 mg/dl (6.2 mmol/liter) and low-density cholesterol of 115 to 174 mg/dl (3.0 to 4.5 mmol/liter), and who are representative of the general population of patients with MI. Patients are randomized to either active or inactive drug therapy. Active therapy consists of pravastatin, 40 mg/day, designed to achieve an average decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of approximately 30%, and an increase in high-density lipoprotein of 5%. The average duration of follow-up will be greater than or equal to 5 years. To protect against a lower than expected rate of recurrent events, the trial will be continued until a predetermined fixed number of coronary heart disease events occurs in the entire cohort so that the original sensitivity of the trial will be maintained.",

Nineteen point one percent of patients reported experiencing symptoms they attributed to simvastatin but had continued therapy, while a further 4.5% of patients had withdrawn from therapy because of side effects. The most frequently reported side effects were muscle ache (13.6%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (4.5%). No abnormalities in biochemical safety tests occurred.", 
    "32": "the rate of side effects reported with prescription use exceeds that previously encountered in clinical trials. Since simvastatin is considered effective and well tolerated it is likely to receive wide acceptance in the management of high risk hypercholesterolaemic patients. However, this study indicates the need for continued physician awareness of the main symptoms and their frequency amongst those treated with simvastatin.", 
    "33": "In primary culture of rat hepatocytes, simvastatin, a powerful HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, inhibited acetate incorporation into cellular and secreted cholesterol and cholesteryl-esters, without any significant effect on triacylglycerol synthesis and secretion. When applied to the culture for 24 h at 10(-7) M, a concentration shown to inhibit cholesterol synthesis by 61%, simvastatin increased apolipoprotein BH and BL synthesis and secretion and strongly decreased apolipoprotein AI synthesis and secretion whereas apolipoprotein AIV remained unaffected. The synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein E was only slightly affected in contrast with other situations where cholesterol synthesis decreased. All of these modifications occurred at a post-transcriptional level, as the corresponding messenger RNAs of the apolipoproteins did not vary. These results suggest that either the drug itself or variations in cholesterol synthesis might be involved in apo B and apo AI synthesis and secretion.", 
    "34": "Human fibroblasts treated with the antihypercholesterolaemic drug, lovastatin, displayed a diminished signaling response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Supplementing the culture medium with mevalonic acid restored the signaling response. Not all growth factor signaling pathways were impaired, however, as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) responses were refractory to lovastatin treatment. These results suggest the involvement of product(s) of mevalonate metabolism (e.g., prenylated proteins such as p21ras or G proteins) in the signal transduction of EGF, insulin and IGF-I. The inhibition of cell growth by lovastatin may be caused by the inability of the cell to enter the S phase of the cell cycle due to obstruction of the signaling of progression factors.",

Treatment of 3 beta-acetoxy-24-hydroxy-5 alpha-chol-8(14)-en-15-one (III) with 1.75 equivalents of tosyl chloride in pyridine for 24 h at 5 degrees C gave 3 beta-acetoxy-24-tosyloxy-5 alpha-chol-8(14)-en-15-one (IV). In contrast, treatment of III with 3.95 equivalents of tosyl chloride in pyridine for 12 h at 48 degrees C gave 3 beta-acetoxy-24-chloro-5 alpha-chol-8(14)-en-15-one (V). Treatment of IV with dimethylamine in dioxane yielded 3 beta-acetoxy-24-dimethylamino-5 alpha-chol-8(14)-en-15-one (VI). Hydrolysis of VI with LiOH.H2O in methanol gave 3 beta-hydroxy-24-dimethylamino-5 alpha-chol-8(14)-en-15-one (VII). 1H- and 13C-NMR assignments are presented for compounds IV-VII. The 25-aza analog (VII) of the 15-ketosterol (I), at a concentration of 1.0 microM, caused a 47% lowering of the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells.", 
    "36": "A 42-year-old woman, found to have increased blood-lipid levels, developed hand-line xanthomas 3 months later. She also had an increased erythrocyte-sedimentation rate and a type lambda monoclonal IgM abnormality. In the course of the following 4 years the IgM concentration rose (from 5.8 to 12.3 g/l) steadily and synchronously with those of the triglycerides (from 147 to 391 mg/dl) and cholesterol (from 212 to 380 mg/dl). During the entire period of observation the ratio of VLDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations was elevated (greater than 0.4; normal: less than 0.3). Division of the lipoprotein fractions pointed to a type III hyperlipoproteinaemia. She also had an abnormality of lipid metabolism on the basis of a genetic defect (apolipoprotein-E2 homozygotism), which only manifested itself when an additional factor, IgM paraproteinaemia, was present. Paraproteins thus apparently interfered with the breakdown of the lipoproteins. Neither bezafibrate in increasing doses (200-800 mg daily) with low-fat diet nor administration of lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) together with nicotinic acid (500 mg twice daily) were adequate treatment for this form of auto-immune hyperlipidaemia.", 
    "37": "Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an acute phase protein with unknown function. Lp(a) binds to low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, as well as to plasminogen (Plg) receptors. Preincubation of normal human skin fibroblasts with Lp(a) or with apo(a) cause a severalfold increase of LDL binding. Plg and kringle-4 of Plg have no effect. LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts respond upon preincubation with apo(a) with high affinity binding of LDL with Kd values that are almost identical with those of LDL binding to the LDL receptor. Incubation of apo(a)-pretreated fibroblasts with anti-apo(a) completely abolishes the increment of LDL binding. The high affinity LDL binding to LDL receptor-negative fibroblasts could be dissociated by approximately 80 and 54% with 5 mg/ml proline and 30 mg/ml NaCl, respectively, but not with dextran sulfate. The Lp(a)- and apo(a)-triggered LDL binding to fibroblasts have no effect on LDL internalization. These findings may reflect a key function in the role as an acute phase protein and may be relevant to the high atherogeneicity of Lp(a).", 
    "38": "Pravastatin is a metabolic product of mevastatin and a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. It was investigated for its cholesterol-lowering properties in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of 82 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Following a 6- to 8-week dietary lead-in period, patients were randomized to twice-daily placebo or active drug for 16 weeks. Patients receiving 10 mg of pravastatin twice a day for 8 weeks experienced mean total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level reductions of 20% (6.85 vs 5.48 mmol/L [265 vs 212 mg/dL]) and 28% (5.17 vs 3.75 mmol/L [200 vs 145 mg/dL]), respectively. At 20 mg twice a day for an additional 8 weeks, pravastatin reduced plasma total cholesterol, LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B-100 levels by 23% (6.85 vs 5.30 mmol/L [265 vs 205 mg/dL]), 31% (5.17 vs 3.59 mmol/L [200 vs 139 mg/dL]), and 23% (118 vs 91 mg/dL), respectively. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), HDLb-C, HDLb-C, and apolipoprotein A-I plasma concentrations increased by 11%, 60%, 7%, and 10%.

Approximately 10% of this population received simvastatin for a period of greater than or equal to 2 years. The population on whom this safety analysis is based had a mean age of 50 years; 62% were men and approximately 27% had preexisting coronary artery disease. Simvastatin was titrated to the maximal daily dose of 40 mg each evening in 56% of the study population (last recorded dose). The most frequently reported drug-related clinical adverse experiences were constipation (2.5%), abdominal pain (2.2%), flatulence (2.0%) and headaches (1%). Persistent elevations of serum transaminase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal were observed in only 1% of this cohort with only 0.1% of the total population requiring discontinuation of therapy. There were no clinically apparent episodes of hepatitis. Discontinuation of therapy due to myopathy was extremely rare (0.08%). Only minimal increases in the frequency of lens opacities (1%) were observed from baseline to the last lens examination during follow-up, consistent with the expected increase in lens opacity development due to normal aging.

    "40": "Subjects with plasma cholesterol levels greater than 240 mg/dl (6.21 mmol/liter) and those with greater than 200 mg/dl (5.18 mmol/liter) who have coronary artery disease, or those with 2 risk factors for ischemic heart disease who do not respond to a hypocholesterolemic diet should all be treated. Lovastatin, which is an inhibitor of hydroxymethygluteryl coenzyme A reductase, is a new agent for treating hypercholesterolemia and is administered in a dose of 20 to 80 mg/day. A study was conducted in which only 10 mg of lovastatin was given to 28 subjects with plasma cholesterol of 200 to 240 mg/dl (5.18 to 6.21 mmol/liter). Cholesterol plasma levels decreased in 19% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 24% from baseline levels after 20 weeks of treatment. All 28 patients decreased their cholesterol values to less than 200 mg% (5.18 mmol/liter), and only 1 had a low-density lipoprotein level greater than 130 mg% (3.36 mmol/liter) at termination of the study. Achievement of desirable values of cholesterol with 10 mg of lovastatin was accompanied by less adverse effects and with significant financial saving. The calculated saving for lovastatin consumers in the USA could be an amount of $60,000,000. Thus, it is recommended that this drug be manufactured in 10 mg tablets.", 
    "41": "Despite the well-documented efficacy of lovastatin, a wide inter-individual variation in treatment responses has been observed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible roles of apolipoprotein E (apo E) phenotype and apolipoprotein B (apo B) XbaI genotype on this variation. The apo E phenotype was determined in 232 subjects (78 cases of familial hypercholesterolaemia [FH] and 154 cases of non-familial hypercholesterolaemia [non-FH]) and the apo B XbaI genotype was determined in 211 subjects (67 cases of FH, 144 cases of non-FH). Depending on their baseline total serum cholesterol levels, these patients used a starting dose of lovastatin of either 20 or 40 mg nightly. After 6 weeks of therapy, slightly but significantly smaller reductions in LDL-cholesterol were observed in patients with the E4/3 phenotype compared with those with the E3/3 phenotype in non-FH with lovastatin 20 mg (-20 vs. -28%; P = 0.043) and in total cholesterol in FH with lovastatin 40 mg (-23 vs. -27%; P = 0.023). No significant differences were found in non-FH patients starting with lovastatin, 40 mg. After doubling of the lovastatin doses, all treatment responses became similar among apo E phenotypes. Moreover, when all patients using lovastatin 40 mg either at 6 or 12 weeks were pooled (n = 224), no differences in treatment responses were observed between the E3/2, E3/3, E4/3 and E4/4 phenotypes. The apo B XbaI genotype did not affect the hypocholesterolaemic efficacy of lovastatin in any of the patient groups. Thus our results indicate that inter-individual variation in the treatment response to lovastatin in both familial and non-familial hypercholesterolaemia is mainly due to factors other than the apo E phenotype or apo B XbaI genotype.", 
    "42": "The rates of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation (the first and rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis from cholesterol) were evaluated in vivo in patients administered bile acids with different structural properties, cholestyramine or simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Twenty-three subjects, with normal hepatic and intestinal functions, were studied in basal conditions and after one of the following treatment schedules, lasting 4 to 6 weeks: cholestyramine, 4 and 12 gm/day (four patients); ursodeoxycholic acid, 9 to 11 mg/kg/day (four patients); chenodeoxycholic acid, 12 to 15 mg/kg/day (five patients); deoxycholic acid, 8 to 10 mg/kg/day (four patients); and simvastatin, 40 mg/day (six patients). 7 alpha-Hydroxylation of cholesterol was assayed by measuring the increase in body water tritium after intravenous bolus of cholesterol tritiated at the 7 alpha position. Plasma bile acid composition, evaluated by gas-liquid chromatography, revealed a substantial enrichment of the recirculating pool by the administered bile acid, whereas treatment with cholestyramine decreased the content of dihydroxylated bile acids. Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylation increased in a dose-related manner after cholestyramine, in parallel with a decrease of cholesterol in total plasma and low-density lipoproteins (1.006 to 1.063 gm/ml). Hydroxylation rates decreased by an average of 47% with chenodeoxycholic acid and by an average of 78% with deoxycholic acid; ursodeoxycholic acid treatment did not affect 7 alpha-hydroxylation significantly. Simvastatin markedly reduced plasma total and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol but exerted no change on 7 alpha-hydroxylation rates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Vasomotor reactivity was assessed in vitro in arterial segments obtained from rabbits with different stages of atherosclerosis. Rabbits were fed a standard chow diet (controls) or a cholesterol-enriched diet to induce hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. A third group received the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, simultaneously with the cholesterol diet. Contractile responses of thoracic aortas to norepinephrine, serotonin, and potassium-rich solution, as well as endothelium-dependent dilations to acetylcholine, were compared after 2 and 4 months on the respective diet. Additionally, plasma cholesterol levels and the amount of plaques covering the intimal surface (as a percentage of the intimal surface) were determined; transmission electron microscopy of atherosclerotic arteries was also performed. After 2 months, the only difference was an enhancement of contractile responses to serotonin in the cholesterol-fed versus the control group. After 4 months on the diet, contractile responses to serotonin were further enhanced, and norepinephrine- and potassium-induced vasoconstrictions were now also significantly enhanced in cholesterol-fed animals versus controls. Endothelium-dependent vasodilations were simultaneously reduced in cholesterol-fed animals. These alterations were partly prevented in cholesterol-fed and lovastatin-treated animals. Suppression of nitric oxide synthesis in control aortas by NG-nitro-L-arginine did not reveal any significant increases in contractile responses. Contractile responses to serotonin were enhanced after 2 months on the diet but before the appearance of intimal plaques, whereas attenuation of endothelium-dependent dilations, as well as the further enhancement of contractile responses to serotonin and to other agonists, were closely correlated with the degree of intimal plaques after 4 months on the diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Previous studies from our laboratories have shown that the metabolism of the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin by rat and human liver microsomes occurs primarily at the 6'-position, giving 6' beta-hydroxy- and 6'-exomethylene-lovastatin and that these oxidations are catalyzed by cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases. In the present study, the specific cytochrome P450 form involved in lovastatin oxidation was identified through immunoinhibition studies. Among several antibodies prepared against various cytochrome P450s, only anti-rat P450 3A IgG inhibited lovastatin metabolism in liver microsomes from untreated, phenobarbital-treated, and pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile-treated rats. Lovastatin metabolism at the 6'-position was markedly inhibited (6' beta-hydroxy, greater than 95%; 6'-exomethylene, 70-80%) by this antibody whereas the effect of anti-rat P450 3A on the 3\"-hydroxylation was variable depending on the source of the microsomes. With human liver microsomes, both anti-rat P450 3A and anti-human P450 3A inhibited lovastatin metabolism. Correlation between lovastatin oxidation and the P450 3A content in human liver microsomes (measured by immunoblot analysis) was excellent (r2 = 0.97). In addition, preincubation of human liver microsomes with troleandomycin and NADPH inhibited metabolism by 60%. These results clearly indicate that cytochrome P450 3A enzymes are primarily responsible for the metabolism of lovastatin in rat and human liver microsomes.", 
    "45": "We have used compactin, an inhibitor of mevalonate biosynthesis, to block p21ras posttranslational modification and membrane association in PC12 cells. Previous studies have demonstrated a requirement for isoprenylation for mitogenic effects of activated p21ras in mammalian cells and for function of RAS gene products in yeast. Immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled p21ras from PC12 cell homogenates confirmed that the processed p21ras species is missing from compactin-treated PC12 cells. Immunoprecipitation from particulate and cytosolic fractions of PC12 cells confirmed that compactin blocks p21ras membrane association: p21ras is confined to the cytosol fraction. Induction of neuronal differentiation and ornithine decarboxylase (ODCase) transcription by oncogenic p21N-ras does not occur in compactin-treated cells indicating that activity of oncogenic p21N-ras expressed in PC12 cells is abolished by compactin treatment. Thus, p21ras isoprenylation or association with the membrane appears to be required for early responses and neuronal differentiation attributable to p21ras activation. In contrast, blockade of p21ras isoprenylation and membrane association by compactin treatment did not significantly reduce PC12 cell responses to NGF. Responses examined included rapid phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase, rapid induction of ODCase expression, survival in serum-free medium and neuronal differentiation. Compactin blocked growth factor-induced rapid changes in cell surface morphology but did so whether this response was induced by NGF or by EGF. These results indicate that functional p21ras is not necessary for responses to NGF which in turn implies that if a ras-dependent NGF signal transduction pathway exists, as has been previously suggested, at least one additional ras-independent pathway must also be present.", 
    "46": "The effect of cholestyramine and simvastatin, given separately or in combination, on serum lipid concentrations in 11 patients with heterozygous familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 was compared with that in 11 matched patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. In both groups of patients there was a substantial fall in serum lipid levels in response to treatment. There were no significant differences between the reductions in serum total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the two groups.", 
    "47": "Statin, a 57 kilodalton (kDa) nuclear protein, is characteristically found in nonproliferating cells in culture as well as nondividing cells of a wide range of highly differentiated tissues. Moreover, cells in culture that are statin positive lose this statin expression when re-entering the cell-cycle traverse. In this work, statin expression was investigated in the parotid gland of untreated rats and those treated with isoproterenol (IPR), a proliferation-inducing catecholamine. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed specific nuclear staining with anti-statin monoclonal antibody (S-44) in the acinar and ducts cells of the untreated rats but significantly reduced in those induced with isoproterenol. To characterize the protein recognized by S-44, protein extracts from both tissues were immunoblotted and incubated with S-44. The antibody reacted specifically with a 48 kDa protein in the extract of the parotid glands from untreated rats while no reaction was detected in that of the proliferation-induced ones. These observations along with the result that a statin-like (S1) transcript is downregulated by isoproterenol in the parotid glands further support the notion that the disappearance of statin-related expression is associated with the IPR-induced proliferation in the rat parotid glands. The discrepancy between the apparent molecular mass of the protein identified by S-44 in nonproliferating parotid cells and that of statin originally found in fibroblasts, suggests that either a modified form of statin may be present in the parotid gland, or this 48 kDa protein may be a member of the nonproliferative statin-like family.", 
    "48": "This study shows the results obtained with lovastatin as a combined therapy with probucol and cholestyramine on the lipid profile of two patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Both have been diagnosed according to the clinical and biochemical criteria (tipe IIa hypercholesterolemia) as well as by the cholesterol or low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) receptor analysis. After the initial probucol and cholestyramine treatment we observed a drop of total cholesterol (T-C) of 41.7% and 46% as well as LDL-C of 51.6% and 49.3% in both patients. Respectively when lovastatin were associated an additional drop of T-C of 23.7%, LDL-C of 23.2%, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of 22.4% and the apoprotein B (Apo B) of 37% were obtained in one patient (receptor-defective) but no change in the lipid profile were obtained in the other patient (receptor-negative). No adverse effects were observed with this drug. This drug could be of help as a combined therapy in the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, even though the treatment of choice is the LDL-plasma feresis and/or liver transplantation. We expound the difficulties relate to LDL receptor study in homocygous receptor-negative patients.", 
    "49": "Oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol (oxysterols) are widely distributed in nature, being found in the blood and tissues of animals and man as well as in foodstuff. They exhibit many biological activities which are of potential physiological, pathological or pharmacological importance. Many oxysterols have been found to be potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis and one or more oxysterols may play a role as the physiologic feedback regulator of cholesterol synthesis. Oxysterols also inhibit cell replication and have cytotoxic properties, effects which suggest that these sterols may participate in the regulation of cell proliferation and may be potentially useful as therapeutic agents for cancer. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence that oxysterols may be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Although the mechanism of action of oxysterols in all these instances is not well understood, the existence of cytosolic and microsomal proteins which bind oxysterols with high affinity and specificity suggests that this group of compounds may represent a family of intracellular regulatory molecules.", 
    "50": "The present study demonstrates very high levels of plasma lipids and high density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoproteins (apoA-I and apoE) in female Nagase analbuminemic rats (NAR) fed a semi-synthetic diet in order to further increase the hyperlipidemia present in this strain. Plasma apoB-containing lipoproteins (very low, intermediate, and low density lipoproteins) were also elevated in NAR. Plasma cholesterol was mainly present in lipoprotein particles with a density between 1.02 and 1.12 g/ml. Separation of lipoprotein classes by gel filtration showed that the major cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein fractions in NAR plasma are apoE-rich HDL and apoA-I-rich HDL. The high HDL levels in NAR are explained, at least partly, by the two- to threefold elevated activity of plasma lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). The lysophosphatidylcholine generated in the LCAT reaction, as well as plasma free fatty acids, are bound to lipoproteins in NAR plasma. A study was carried out to determine whether the elevated LDL and aopoE-rich HDL levels could be corrected by administration of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin (at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day). Pravastatin treatment results in a 43% decrease in plasma triglycerides in NAR, but not in Sprague-Dawley (SDR) rats, and had no significant effect on plasma total cholesterol, phospholipids apolipoproteins A-I, A-IV, B, or E, as well as on plasma LCAT activity levels in NAR or SDR.", 
    "51": "Primary astroglial cultures were used to compare the relationships to cell cycling of dolichol-linked glycoprotein synthesis, and of availability of mevalonate, the precursor of dolichol and other isoprenoid lipids. With shift-up to 10% serum (time 0) after 48 h of serum depletion, the proportion of cells in S phase (bromodeoxyuridine immunofluorescence) remained under 15% for 12 h, then increased by 20 h to 72 +/- 10%; DNA synthetic rates (thymidine incorporation) increased 5-fold. S phase transition was prevented by addition at 10-12 h of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of transfer of saccharide moieties to dolichol. Mevinolin, an inhibitor of mevalonate biosynthesis, also blocked cycle progression when added at this time. However, mevinolin markedly inhibited the isoprenoid pathway, as reflected by over 90% reduction of sterol synthesis, without inhibiting net glycoprotein synthesis. Removal of mevinolin after a 24 h exposure delayed S phase until 48 h, following recovery of sterol synthesis, even though kinetics of glycoprotein synthesis were unaffected. Tunicamycin removal after 24 h spared sterol synthesis, but caused delay of S phase until 72 h, following recovery of glycoprotein synthesis. In mevinolin-treated cultures, S phase transition was restored by 1 h of exposure to mevalonate at 10 h, although cycling was thereby rendered sensitive to inhibition by cycloheximide and by tunicamycin. Cell cycle progression following hydroxyurea exposure and release was unaffected by mevinolin, tunicamycin, or cycloheximide. Thus, in these developing astroglia, mevalonate and its isoprenoid derivatives have at least two cell cycle-specific roles: dolichol-linked glycoprotein synthesis is required at or before the G1/S transition, while a distinct mevalonate requirement is apparent also in late G1.",

The optimal drug therapy of hypercholesterolaemia in recipients after cardiac transplantation, however, has not been defined. Simvastatin (an inhibitor of hydroxy-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase), at a dose of 10 mg/day, was administered to 12 recipients with serum total cholesterol greater than or equal to 7.8 mmol/l and serum triglyceride less than or equal to 4.5 mmol/l refractory to dietary measures during a follow-up period of 1-5 years after cardiac transplantation. All patients received maintenance doses of cyclosporin A and, in some instances, azathioprine and prednisolone. After 2 months treatment with simvastatin, serum total cholesterol was significantly reduced from 8.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/l (mean +/- SEM) to 5.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, P less than 0.001, low density cholesterol from 6.6 +/- 0.4 to 3.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, P less than 0.001 and triglycerides from 2.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/l to 1.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, P less than 0.005. These changes were maintained after a period of treatment of 8 months. Serum high density cholesterol, hepatic transaminase levels, serum creatinine, creatine kinase and cyclosporin A blood levels were not altered by treatment with simvastatin. It is concluded that, in this study group, low-dose simvastatin appears to be well tolerated and has favourable lipid modifying properties.", 
    "53": "Seven boys with an apparently X-linked syndrome of dilated cardiomyopathy, growth retardation, neutropenia, and persistently elevated urinary levels of 3-methylglutaconate, 3-methylglutarate, and 2-ethylhydracrylate were studied. The natural history of the disorder was characterized by severe or lethal cardiac disease and recurrent infections during infancy and early childhood but relative improvement in later childhood. The initial presentation of the syndrome varied from congenital dilated cardiomyopathy to infantile congestive heart failure to isolated neutropenia without clinical evidence of heart disease. The excretion of 3-methylglutaconate and 3-methylglutarate appeared to be independent of the metabolism of leucine, the presumed precursor of these organic acids in humans. Although the cause of the organic aciduria remains obscure, the constellation of biochemical and clinical abnormalities forms a distinct syndrome that may be a relatively common cause of dilated cardiomyopathy or neutropenia in boys during infancy and childhood.", 
    "54": "The myelination-related enzyme 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP), a relatively abundant protein in the CNS possesses the C-terminal isoprenylation consensus domain found in a small family that includes the ras oncoproteins and their relatives, some G-proteins, and nuclear lamins. We found that CNP, like these other proteins, is modified posttranslationally by an isoprenoid derived from mevalonic acid. It appears that only the smaller of the two CNP isoforms (CNP1) is isoprenylated, but similar modification of CNP2 cannot be excluded. Inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis by Lovastatin blocks the binding of newly synthesized CNP to cell membranes; binding is restored upon addition of mevalonate to the culture medium. This shows that isoprenylation is permissive for the well-known avid association of CNP with membranes.", 
    "55": "The Na(+)-H+ antiport is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that extrudes intracellular acid loads and regulates cellular volume. Cellular synthesis of the oligosaccharide side chains of glycoproteins is dependent on a supply of mevalonate, itself a product of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. The effect of two HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (simvastatin and 25-hydroxycholesterol) on intracellular pH and Na(+)-H+ exchange was therefore studied. Inhibition of the Na(+)-H+ antiport by these agents led to a fall in intracellular pH but did not impair the regulatory volume increase response to a hypertonic stimulus. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin was prevented by mevalonate but not dolichol or squalene. The effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol was more complex and not easily reversed. Thus HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduced the ability of human lymphoblasts to expel an intracellular acid load via the Na(+)-H+ antiport, although the response of the antiport to an osmotic stimulus was preserved.", 
    "56": "A 32-carboxylic acid derivative of lanosterol (SKF 104976) was found to be a potent inhibitor of lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (14 alpha DM). 14 alpha DM activity in a Hep G2 cell extract was inhibited 50% by 2 nM SKF 104976. Exposure of intact cells to similar concentrations of the compound resulted in the inhibition of incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol with concomitant accumulation of lanosterol as well as a 40-70% decrease in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) activity. SKF 104976 did not effect low density lipoprotein uptake and degradation in Hep G2 cells, suggesting that HMGR and low density lipoprotein receptor activity were not coordinately regulated under these conditions. Reduction of the flux of carbon units in the sterol synthetic pathway by as much as 80% did not alter the suppressing effect of SKF 104976 on HMGR activity. However, under conditions where sterol synthesis was almost completely blocked by lovastatin, HMGR activity was not suppressed by SKF 104976. Mevalonate, at concentrations that did not decrease HMGR activity, was able to restore the inhibiting effect of SKF 104976 on HMGR activity. The rapid inhibition (2-3 h) of HMGR activity by SKF 104976 to 30-60% of the level in controls was not dependent on the initial amount of HMGR enzyme present. These findings suggest that upon inhibition of 14 alpha DM by SKF 104976, a mevalonate-derived precursor regulates HMGR activity, even when the sterol synthetic rate is considerably reduced and when HMGR protein levels are very high. In Hep G2 cells, formation of oxylanostenols from [3H]mevalonate reached a maximum between 1 and 10 nM SKF 104976 and was negligible at higher concentrations. This result suggests that oxylanostenols are not the key mediators of the modulation of HMGR in Hep G2 cells upon 14 alpha DM inhibition.", 
    "57": "The mechanisms through which Ca2+ mobilization in rat hepatocytes results in the loss of total activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase [Zammit & Caldwell (1990) Biochem. J. 269, 373-379] were investigated. The loss of total activity was shown to be paralleled by an equal loss of immunoreactive HMG-CoA reductase protein after exposure of hepatocytes to optimal concentrations of vasopressin plus glucagon for 40 min. This loss of enzyme protein was due to an inhibition of enzyme synthesis; the rate of degradation was unaffected. Other Ca(2+)-mobilizing conditions (phenylephrine, glucagon, vasopressin added singly and A23187) also resulted in graded inhibition of synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase. These effects were accentuated by omission of Ca2+ from the cell incubation medium, suggesting that it is the depletion of an intracellular InsP3-sensitive pool of Ca2+ to which synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase is sensitive. In agreement with this we found that t-butylhydroxybenzoquinone, which inhibits the activity of the Ca(2+)-ATPase of the endoplasmic-reticular membrane, mimicked the action of Ca(2+)-mobilizing hormones. However, taurolithocholate, which transiently mobilizes Ca2+ from the same pool, was ineffective. All these effects on HMG-CoA reductase were accompanied by parallel inhibition of 35S incorporation from [35S]methionine into total protein, suggesting that inhibition of reductase synthesis formed part of a generalized response of the hepatocyte to Ca2+ mobilization. Inhibition of the rate of synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase was, however, more responsive to Ca2+ mobilization in the absence of added Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. The concentrations of vasopressin required to elicit the inhibition of synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase were of the same order as those that elicited activation of glycogen phosphorylase in hepatocytes.", 
    "58": "The effect of lipid lowering on hard exudates was determined in six consecutive patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Diet and hypolipidemic drug therapy including the use of pravastatin, a new inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase, were used to treat patients for one year. The total cholesterol concentration decreased from a mean baseline value of 231 mg/dl to a treatment mean value of 165 mg/dl. The mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration decreased from 157 mg/dl to 93 mg/dl. Masked grading of fundus photographs indicated an improvement in hard exudates in all six patients and a decrease in microaneurysms in four patients. Visual acuity improved in one patient and did not change (one line or less change) in five patients. No remarkable side effects resulting from treatment were observed. Our pilot study suggests that aggressive therapy of diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia may have a beneficial effect on background retinopathy.", 
    "59": "Low density lipoproteins (LDL) are large (Mr = 2.5 x 10(6)) in comparison to LDL receptors (Mr = 115,000). Since most LDL receptors are clustered in coated pits, we tested the hypothesis that crowding of receptor-bound LDL particles would cause steric effects. The apparent affinity of LDL for receptors on cultured fibroblasts decreased near saturation causing concave-upward Scatchard plots. Both the higher and lower affinity components of binding were up-regulated by the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, lovastatin, indicating that the entire binding curve was sterol-responsive. In contrast, neither component of LDL binding was present on lovastatin-treated or untreated null fibroblasts which are incapable of expressing LDL receptors. Therefore, the concave-upward Scatchard plots were entirely due to binding to LDL receptors. These results are consistent with a lattice model in which receptor-bound LDL are large enough to decrease binding to adjacent receptors. A lattice model implies that large LDL should produce steric effects at a lower receptor occupancy than should small LDL. This was tested using seven LDL fractions that differed in diameter from 20 to 27 nm. Fewer large than small LDL were bound to the cell surface at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C, and fewer were internalized and degraded at 37 degrees C. Since large LDL bound via both apolipoprotein (apo) E and apoB100, receptor cross-linking could have caused fewer large LDL to be bound at saturation. However, when the potential for cross-linking was prevented by an apo-E-specific monoclonal antibody (1D7), the difference in binding by large versus small LDL was not eliminated; instead, it was exaggerated. Taken together, these results support a lattice model for LDL binding and indicate that steric hindrance associated with crowding of LDL particles on receptor lattices is a major determinant for catabolism by the LDL receptor pathway in vitro.",

The effects of simvastatin (one of a new class of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) and fenofibrate on the fatty acid composition of cholesterol esters, phospholipids and triglycerides of different lipoproteins of 15 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia were compared in a double-blind study. 2. Fenofibrate (300 mg day-1) increased the relative content of saturated fatty acids of cholesterol esters, phospholipids and triglycerides in VLDL, IDL and HDL. It also increased the relative content of monounsaturated fatty acids of cholesterol esters and phospholipids in all fractions and those of triglycerides in VLDL and IDL. In contrast, it decreased the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids of cholesterol esters and phospholipids in all fractions and those of triglycerides in VLDL and IDL. The polyunsaturated/saturated (P/S) ratio was reduced in cholesterol esters and phospholipids in VLDL and in phospholipids in IDL by fenofibrate. The drug significantly increased the 18:1w9/18:2w6 ratio in cholesterol esters and phospholipids in VLDL, LDL and HDL, but produced a non-significant increase in the ratio in IDL. 3. Simvastatin (20 mg day-1) produced a significant decrease in saturated fatty acid and an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acid in triglycerides in VLDL. Simvastatin, in contrast to fenofibrate caused a slight decrease in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the three other lipoprotein fractions, and an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Drug therapy reduced total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations by 33% and 32%, respectively. During lovastatin therapy, LDL-cholesterol levels fell by 37%, and LDL-apo B concentrations decreased by an average of 29%. The decrease in LDL-apo B concentrations on lovastatin therapy was largely due to an increase in fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) for LDL apo B. The average increase in FCRs was 34%, whereas transport rates (production rates) for LDL apo B remained unchanged. These results strongly suggest that an increase in LDL-receptor activity is the major mechanism whereby LDL levels are lowered during lovastatin therapy. The data do not indicate that this drug inhibited the input of apo B-containing lipoproteins, which would have been expected to result in a decrease in the rate of production of LDL.",

The mean percentage of calories from total fat and saturated, unsaturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids was similar throughout the year even though the patients knew they were taking an effective lipid-lowering agent. However, the diets of greater than 40% of women included less than two-thirds of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of folic acid, vitamins B-6 and D, and calcium and zinc; in men, folic acid and zinc intakes were low.

    "73": "Treatment of HepG2 cells in lipoprotein-deficient media with 4,4,10 beta-trimethyl-trans-decal-3 beta-ol (TMD) abolished the incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol with concomitant accumulation of squalene 2,3(S)-oxide and squalene 2,3(S):22(S),23-dioxide, indicating a specific inhibition of oxidosqualene cyclase. The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase was affected in a biphasic manner, being inhibited by 30% at low concentrations of TMD and stimulated by 30% at concentrations that completely shut down oxidosqualene cyclase. Treatment with TMD (greater than 20 micrograms/ml) doubled the specific binding and internalization of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and also enhanced their degradation to a degree comparable to that produced by lovastatin, a well-known inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. The enhanced binding of LDL to HepG2 cells appeared to occur as a result of an increase in the number of binding sites with no change in their binding affinity for the lipoprotein. At concentrations that completely inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis, TMD did not affect the ability of LDL-derived cholesterol to stimulate cholesterol esterification by seven- to tenfold or to stimulate bile acid secretion to a lesser degree. However, TMD treatment inhibited overall bile acid secretion by 75-85%. The compound had no inhibitory effect on the rates of secretion of either apolipoprotein B or of cholesterol by HepG2 cells into the culture medium. These data demonstrate that a specific inhibition of the sterol branch of isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in hepatic cells by TMD is sufficient to induce the expression of LDL receptors and that the cholesterol delivered by LDL is available for normal metabolic purposes of the cell.",

After incubation of plasma with 14C-labelled compounds, radioactivity was found in all lipoprotein fractions but mainly (40%) in high density lipoprotein (HDL), and in the lipoprotein-deficient plasma fraction (20-30%). Drug-treated lipoproteins showed reduced electrophoretic mobility on cellulose acetate in comparison with control lipoproteins. The lovastatin-treated low density lipoprotein (LDL) displayed 28% increased fluidity in comparison with control LDL. The immunoreactivity of drug-treated LDL with monoclonal antibody directed towards the LDL receptor binding domains (B1B6) was significantly less than that of control LDL, suggesting reduced binding to the LDL receptor. When drug-treated LDL was incubated with J-774 A.1 macrophage-like cell line, its binding (at 4 degrees C) was 28% less than that of control LDL, whereas a substantial increase in the cellular cholesterol esterification rate (by 83% with lovastatin and by 67% with simvastatin) was noted. Similarly, the degradation of lovastatin and simvastatin-treated LDL by macrophages was 87-89% greater than that of control LDL. The \"apparent Vmax\" for the macrophage degradation of lovastatin-treated LDL was 70% greater than that for control LDL. Thus, both drugs may have a dual effect on the macrophage uptake of LDL; they may increase the number of LDL receptors on the cell surface, but they may also reduce the affinity of LDL for its receptor, the former being the major effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "In the present study we investigated the influence of cholesterol depletion and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibition on chemotaxis of the human monocytic cell line U937. Chemotaxis was nearly completely depressed after incubation for 24 h in the absence of lipoproteins. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in cellular cholesterol. Addition of 10 micrograms/ml low density lipoprotein (LDL) for 2 h to the cholesterol-depleted cells restored chemotaxis. Free cholesterol had no effect under these conditions. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by pravastatin (0.01-1.0 mM) for 20 or 72 h also reduced chemotaxis. However, this effect was not accompanied by a decrease in cellular cholesterol when cells were grown in the presence of lipoproteins. The effect of pravastatin could be reversed by the addition of mevalonate. Addition of LDL did not change the response to pravastatin. We propose that the availability of cholesterol plays an important role in cellular chemotaxis. Furthermore, it can be suggested that other products of the mevalonate pathway apart from cholesterol may contribute to the regulation of chemotaxis.",

Fmev suppressed DNA synthesis by a variety of transformed and malignant T cell, B cell, and myeloid cell lines. In contrast to results previously reported with mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood T cell DNA synthesis, low concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) alone could not restore proliferation to these cell lines. The same concentrations of LDL were able to provide sufficient cholesterol and support the growth of all cell lines when mevalonate synthesis was blocked with a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, lovastatin. Fmev-mediated inhibition was totally prevented in some but not all cell lines when the concentration of exogenous LDL was increased 5-10-fold above that required to permit proliferation of lovastatin-blocked cells. Residual HMG-CoA reductase activity of cells cultured with LDL inversely correlated with the restoration of growth to Fmev-blocked cultures. Confirmation of the critical role of HMG-CoA reductase activity and mevalonate synthesis in the inhibition of cellular proliferation by Fmev was obtained by demonstrating that the specific inhibitor of this enzyme, lovastatin, restored proliferation of Fmev-blocked cells. Furthermore, supplementation of cultures with mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase activity, markedly inhibited proliferation of Fmev-blocked cells. These findings indicate that mevalonate or one of the mevalonate phosphates, which accumulates in Fmev-blocked cells, is a critical negative regulator of cellular proliferation.",

    "86": "A novel class of hypocholesterolaemic agents, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, was shown to cause mucosal thickening in the rodent (mouse and rat) forestomach after subacute/subchronic oral administration. These changes were characterized histologically by acanthosis and hyperkeratosis of the squamous epithelium with submucosal oedema and occasionally cellular infiltration. This drug-induced hyperplastic response was both dose and time dependent, did not occur after subcutaneous administration, and was confined entirely to the rodent forestomach (not observed in any other area of the gastro-intestinal tract). The forestomach hyperplastic response correlated with the pharmacological potency of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors of similar structure (observed to varying degrees with all HMG CoA reductase inhibitors examined to date).", 
    "87": "Lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and a potent hypocholesterolemic agent, induces a hyperplastic thickening of the rat forestomach mucosa after oral administration of its active form, a hydroxyacid. We studied the effects of lovastatin on the intracellular accumulation of HMG-CoA reductase immunostaining and the accompanying morphological changes in rat forestomach keratinocytes by immunofluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Administration of lovastatin hydroxyacid induced increases in HMG-CoA reductase levels within forestomach keratinocytes that were dose and time dependent and reversible. The adjacent glandular stomach epithelium did not exhibit induction of reductase. A pharmacologically inactive epimer of lovastatin hydroxyacid did not increase keratinocyte reductase accumulation, and lovastatin lactone induced minimal forestomach reductase. TEM of forestomachs from rats given lovastatin hydroxyacid demonstrated profound alterations in epidermal lamellar bodies (organelles that transport lipids and steroids to the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum). Treated cells lacked internal lipid lamellae and failed to secrete sheets of lipid material into the intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum. We hypothesize that sustained inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in rat forestomach keratinocytes induces accumulation of HMG-CoA reductase and hyperplasia by inhibiting sterol synthesis, assembly of lamellar bodies, and formation of intercellular lipid sheets.",

    "91": "All patients with dyslipidemia treated by niacin (n = 82) at the Atherosclerosis Detection and Prevention Clinic during 1987 to 1990, including a subgroup of 17 dyslipidemic heart transplant recipients.", 
    "92": "Niacin was well tolerated in 83% of the nontransplant group (n = 65) at an average dose of 2.5 +/- 0.9 g/day. Similar beneficial lipoprotein effects were found in the transplant and nontransplant patients. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) response to niacin therapy was independent of the baseline (HDL-C level. In the transplant group, 11 patients (65%) discontinued treatment, primarily because of hyperglycemia; this was especially prominent in those patients with pretreatment diabetes mellitus. Of the 15 patients using sustained-release niacin, eight cases of hepatitis were recorded, some during therapy with relatively low niacin doses. Several different sustained-release preparations were responsible for this phenomenon, suggesting that the cause was not a contaminant in the preparation. No cases of hepatitis were documented in the 67 patients using regular niacin. One case of hepatitis was recently observed in a patient who switched from one type to regular niacin to another; however, we have data to suggest that the substituted preparation was not an immediate-release niacin. A familial predisposition to hepatitis is suggested by the occurrence of this side effect in identical twin brothers and two sisters. A pharmacy survey disclosed that most pharmacists are unaware of the relationship of sustained-release niacin to hepatitis, have a negative impression of regular niacin, and do not stock this formulation. Finally, we found that in this small sample of patients, niacin used with lovastatin is a particularly effective drug combination and appears to have few side effects beyond those seen with niacin alone.", 
    "93": "Our experience supports the fact that regular niacin is a useful lipid-modifying drug. When used appropriately, patients can usually tolerate adequate doses for prolonged periods and achieve meaningful results. However, this requires a certain amount of physician skill and patient motivation. The use of sustained-release preparations to overcome this problem can lead to harmful consequences and should only be done under strict medical supervision. In our opinion, the availability of sustained-release niacin as a nonprescription drug is unjustified and should be reexamined. Finally, we have observed that reduction of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) with niacin alone leads to an elevation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in many patients; this indicates to us that the mechanism whereby niacin lowers VLDL-C and total cholesterol is not solely the result of a decreased synthesis of VLDL-C.",

A particularly severe form, often accompanied by rhabdomyolysis, has been reported with the use of lovastatin and gemfibrozil; however, as far as we know, no case has been documented with use of gemfibrozil alone. Herein, we report the first case (to our knowledge of gemfibrozil-induced myopathy, confirmed by drug rechallenge.",

    "96": "After a six-week period of screening, during which patients were maintained on lipid-lowering diet, they were administered placebo for four weeks. Those patients, whose total cholesterol (TC) remained above 250 mg/dl were eligible for active treatment. Thirty-one patients were administered L and P for 12 weeks. The initial dosage of L was 20 mg daily and it was titrated up to 40 mg daily at the end of the fifth week of treatment, whenever total cholesterol levels remained above 200 mg/dl; P was administered at a dosage of 500 mg b.i.d. through 12 weeks. Lipid analyses (TC, triglycerides-Tg, high-density cholesterol (HDL-C) non HDL cholesterol, low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) very low-density cholesterol (VLDL-C) and the ratios CT/HDL-C and laboratory safety measurements were performed during placebo period and at the end of the 5th and 12th weeks of active treatment. Clinical and ophthalmological evaluations were performed and eventual adverse reactions were recorded on different occasions.", 
    "97": "1) L induced decrease of TC, LDL-C/HDL-C of 27.9, 34.1, 32.2, 30.9 and 36.5% respectively. These reductions were significantly more pronounced than those induced by P (21.7, 23.8, 24.5, 11.3 and 13.4% respectively); 2) L induced an increase of HDL-C of 6.8%, while P induced a reduction of HDL-C of 6.9%; 3) 54.8% and 51.6% of the patients treated with L showed reductions of the ratios TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C respectively. The patients who were administered P showed decrease in those indices of 15.7% and 13.1% respectively; 4) L was associated with 77.4% and 77.3% of excellent and good responses for TC and LDL-C. Regular and poor responses were more frequently observed during the treatment with P (39.4% each); 5) the incidence of adverse reactions was low and tolerability was considered good for both drugs.", 
    "98": "Lovastatin was more effective in the reduction of atherogenic lipoprotein fraction and in the increase of the protective one, with more pronounced reduction of the risk indices. They suggest that with the administration of L, that leads to an appropriate normalization of TC and LDL-C levels, greater benefits on morbidity and mortality of coronary disease can be achieved.", 
    "99": "The apparent octanol-water partition coefficients (Po/w) and aqueous solubilities for four 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors [pravastatin, lovastatin (mevinolin), mevastatin (compactin), and simvastatin (synvinolin)] were compared. Pravastatin is highly hydrophilic compared with lovastatin, mevastatin, or simvastatin. Pravastatin is clinically used as the active hydroxy acid, while the other three compounds are administered as prodrug lactones which, over a period of time, convert in vivo to their respective active hydroxy acid forms. The order of the Po/w values of the hydroxy acid forms was pravastatin much less than mevastatin less than lovastatin less than simvastatin at each pH evaluated, with approximate ratios of 1:25:75:200, respectively. The relative order and the ratios of partition coefficients for the lactone forms were similar to those for the hydroxy acid forms. In addition, lovastatin, mevastatin, and simvastatin are virtually insoluble in water, with solubility values ranging from 0.0013 to 0.0015 mg/mL at 23 degrees C. In comparison, pravastatin is hydrophilic, as demonstrated by the greater than 100-fold greater solubility of its lactone form (0.18 mg/mL). The greater hydrophilicity of pravastatin may explain its reported lower permeation into nonhepatic cells and the selectivity with respect to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "100": "The effects of long term administration of pravastatin (a competitive inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase) were assessed by measuring serum lipids and aortic and coronary atherosclerosis in Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits. Six-month-old WHHL rabbits were given either 50 mg/kg/day of the drug or vehicle. The rabbits were sacrificed following 6 or 12 months of treatment and serum cholesterol and triglycerides and aortic cholesterol and hydroxyproline were measured. Atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta and coronary arteries were quantified with morphometric methods. Mean serum cholesterol +/- SEM (n) in the control vs. pravastatin groups after 6 months were: 535 +/- 34 (11) vs. 411 +/- 22 (12) (p less than 0.005) and after 12 months 458 +/- 43 (9) vs. 309 +/- 29 mg/dl (12) (p less than 0.005). In the pravastatin group, percent aortic area covered with plaque and aortic cholesterol content were reduced 35% (ns) and 55% (p less than 0.05) at 6 months, and 26% (ns) and 44% (ns) at 12 months, respectively. Little difference was found in serum triglycerides and aortic hydroxyproline in the 2 groups. There was strong correlation of serum cholesterol with aortic cholesterol content (r = 0.61, p less than 0.003) and with the percent aortic plaque area (r = 0.67, p less than 0.001), at 12 months. Morphometric analysis of wall thickness and lumen area of major coronary arteries revealed no significant differences in the 2 groups. In conclusion, pravastatin effectively lowered the serum cholesterol level in an animal model defective in low density lipoprotein receptors; this reduction was strongly correlated with amelioration of such atherosclerotic processes as lipid deposition and plaque formation.", 
    "101": "1) Analogues of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA were prepared in which the substituents at C-3 of the acyl residue were altered. The same analogues were additionally modified by replacement of the thioester oxygen by hydrogen to yield reduction-resistant CoA-thioethers. The interaction of both types of CoA derivatives with a 58-kDa catalytic fragment of human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase was studied. 2) This enzyme reduces glutaryl-CoA at a very low rate whereas 3-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA is well reduced, the maximal rate of reduction being 7% that of the physiological substrate. Only half of total 3-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA was attacked, thus reflecting the stereo-specificity of the enzyme for (3S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA. The results invalidate the hitherto assumed absolute substrate specificity of the enzyme. 3) The affinity of both 3-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA and its thioether variant S-(4-carboxy-3-hydroxybutyl)CoA to the reductase, Ki = 0.3 microM and Ki = 0.4 microM, respectively, is higher than that of the physiological substrate, Km = 1.5 microM (data related to (S)-diastereomer). The results show for the first time that the methyl-group effect observed with the inhibitor lovastatin is an intrinsic property of the enzyme. 4) All of the prepared CoA derivatives are purely competitive inhibitors of the reductase, the affinities varying within a range of two powers of ten (Ki = 0.3-32 microM). On variation of the substituents at C-3 of the acyl residue of the physiological substrate the affinity of both CoA-thioesters and CoA-thioethers increases in the sequence CH2, C(CH3)2, CH(CH3), C(OH)CH3, CH(OH).", 
    "102": "The attempts to find a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase which catalyzes the rate limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis were started from 1971. The first potent inhibitor, ML-236B (compactin), was found from the culture broth of Penicillium citrinum. Among many derivatives of ML-236B, pravastatin sodium (hereafter refer to pravastatin) was finally selected because of its potency and tissue selectivity. Since pravastatin has a hydroxyl group at 6 beta position in the skeleton of decaline of ML-236B, the microbial hydroxylation was adopted for the production of pravastatin. Streptomyces carbophilus was finally chosen as a potent converter with the formation of a lesser amount of by-products. For the sake of industrial production of pravastatin, many devices and improvements were performed for selecting high potent strains and for culturing conditions both with ML-236B and pravastatin. Pravastatin strongly inhibited the sterol synthesis in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes, but only weakly inhibited in the cells from nonhepatic tissues. This selective inhibition of pravastatin in sterol synthesis was further confirmed by ex vivo and in vivo experiments by using rats and mice. Pravastatin markedly reduced serum cholesterol levels in dogs, monkeys and rabbits, including Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, an animal model for familial hypercholesterolemia. Pravastatin showed the preventive effect on the development of coronary atherosclerosis and xanthoma in young WHHL rabbits in consequence of maintaining the serum cholesterol levels low. In the clinical trials, pravastatin significantly reduced serum cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, whereas inversely increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.", 
    "103": "EUE cells adapted to grow for long times in a hypertonic medium have a longer cell cycle than those growing in isotonic medium. To elucidate whether this lengthening involves specific cycle phases to differing extents, the expression of two cycle-related protein, PCNA and statin, was studied by dual parameter flow cytometry of indirect immunofluorescence protein labelling and DNA content. In isotonic medium, most cells, in all the cycle phases, were PCNA positive; in contrast, PCNA negative cells and statin positive cells were very few in number and only fell in the G0/1 range of DNA contents. In hypertonic medium, the frequency of PCNA positive cells was lower, and that of statin positive cells higher, than in isotonic medium, particularly in the G0/1 range of DNA contents: this suggests that a G0 block occurs under long-term hypertonic stress. Consistently, dual parameter flow cytometric measurement of BrdUrd immunofluorescence labelling and DNA content showed that fewer cells entered S phase in hypertonic medium and their progression through the S phase was slower; evidence was also found for the occurrence of a G2 block. These kinetics changes were fully reversible in isotonic medium, thus indicating the adaptive nature of the EUE response to hypertonicity.", 
    "104": "This study examined the effects of simvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, on the metabolism of labelled human low density lipoprotein (LDL) in animal models. Administration of 10 mg/kg per day simvastatin for 2 weeks reduced the levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides by 5.7 mg/dl (16%), 8.8 mg/dl (36%) and 4.9 mg/dl (13%), respectively in guinea pigs. High density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels rose 0.8 mg/dl (29%) by simvastatin treatment. Measurements of turnover of LDL were determined between simvastatin-treated guinea pigs and untreated guinea pigs using intravenous injection of 131I-labelled LDL and 125I-labelled galactose-treated LDL to quantify the LDL receptor pathway. Simvastatin significantly increased the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of the LDL receptor-dependent pathway. In contrast, the FCR of the LDL receptor-independent pathway was not altered by simvastatin therapy. The FCR for LDL isolated from simvastatin-treated subjects compared to that from control subjects was very similar in both control and simvastatin-fed guinea pigs. These findings suggest that simvastatin mainly reduced serum cholesterol levels by accelerated FCR of LDL receptor mediated pathway."
