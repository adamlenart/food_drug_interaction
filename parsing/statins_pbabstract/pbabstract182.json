    "0": "It is generally believed that high levels of cholesterol (hypercholesterolaemia) are life-threatening, while low levels seem to be positive. Unfortunately this assumption is far from true, and can be indicative of an underlying serious medical condition in most of the cases (i.e. cancer). However, the biological role of severe hypocholesterolaemia is poorly understood. Here, the possible biological process is being investigated. Cholesterol plays a key role in cell proliferation, hence it has been suggested that low cholesterol levels are probably linked to the high cellular cholesterol demands from neoplastic cells.", 
    "1": "We used serum and isolated T-lymphocytes from patients with acute lymphoblast leukaemia and human lymphoblast cell line to test this hypothesis.", 
    "2": "We found that patients with low serum cholesterol levels have instead high levels of cholesterol in lymphocytes. These data were supported with in vitro studies. In fact we have demonstrated that low cholesterol level in the culture medium was related to the neoplastic cellular growth, suggesting a greater use by lymphoma cells for their proliferation. Therefore by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis by mevastatin, in vitro, we showed that cholesterol levels did not change significantly in culture medium and the cellular growth was inhibited.", 
    "3": "Following these preliminary results, blood cholesterol levels could be potentially considered a good biological marker to follow up the neoplastic process.", 
    "4": "Simvastatin, the most widely used cholesterol-lowering drug, has been reported to protect the adult brain from ischemia. Nevertheless, little is known about its action on developing brain after stroke. Although a few reports have found recently that simvastatin displays anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis properties and improves the cognitive and morphological consequences in the neonatal rats after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) damage, to our best knowledge, there has been no study of the effect of it on myelin formation after neonatal brain damage. Therefore, we investigated whether simvastatin could promote the myelination of oligodendrocytes in the neonatal rats after HI and explored the possible role of microglial responses in this process.", 
    "5": "Postnatal day 7 Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to HI. White matter integrity and myelination were evaluated by the densitometry of myelin basic protein (MBP) immunostaining. OX-42 immunoreactivity and nissl staining were used for identifying microglial responses and the structure changes of white matter and adjacent gray matter after HI. Simvastatin was administrated prophylactically to rats.", 
    "6": "HI induced serious hypomyelination especially in external and internal capsules 3 and 7 days after HI, accompanying with microglial activation remarkably. Simvastatin treatment greatly increased the densities of MBP immunostaining, inhibited microglial activation and reduced the numbers of pyknotic cells and neuronal loss.", 
    "7": "The present study shows that simvastatin treatment in neonatal rats attenuates HI-induced developing oligodendrocytes injury and hypomyelination. Its anti-inflammatory properties via suppression of microglial activation are likely to contribute to this action. It provides experimental evidence to support the neuroprotective effects of statins in neonatal ischemic stroke.", 
    "8": "Dietary factors that influence lipid levels include modification of nutritional components, consumption of specific foods, use of food additives and supplements, and major dietary approaches. The most beneficial changes result from reducing intake of saturated and trans fats; increasing intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats; fortifying foods with plant stanols or sterols; isocalorically adding tree nuts to the diet; consuming one or two alcoholic drinks per day; and adopting a Portfolio, Mediterranean, low-carbohydrate, or low-fat diet. Smaller but still beneficial effects result from reducing intake of dietary cholesterol, increasing intake of soluble fiber and soy protein, and eating fatty marine fish or taking marine-derived omega-3 fatty acid supplements. Red yeast rice supplements have effects similar to those of statin medications and are better tolerated in some patients. Regular aerobic exercise has beneficial effects on lipid levels, particularly if performed for at least 120 minutes per week. Brief physician counseling will have relatively small effects on unselected patients, so efforts should be concentrated on patients who are motivated and ready to make lifestyle changes.", 
    "9": "Subclinical brain infarct (SBI) is associated with subsequent stroke and cognitive decline. A longitudinal epidemiological study suggests that statins may prevent development of SBI. We investigated the effects of statins upon development of brain infarct by performing a post-hoc analysis of the Regression of Cerebral Artery Stenosis (ROCAS) study.", 
    "10": "The ROCAS study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of simvastatin 20 mg daily upon progression of asymptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis among stroke-free individuals over 2 years. A total of 227 subjects were randomized to either placebo (n = 114) or simvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 113). The number of brain infarcts as detected by MRI was recorded at baseline and at the end of the study. The primary outcome measure was the number of new brain infarcts at the end of the study.", 
    "11": "Among the 227 randomized subjects, 33 (14.5%) had SBI at baseline. At the end of the study, significantly fewer subjects in the active group (n = 1) had new brain infarcts compared with the placebo group (n = 8; p = 0.018). The new brain infarcts of subjects in the active group were subclinical. Among the placebo group, the new brain infarcts of 3 subjects were symptomatic while those of the remaining 5 subjects were subclinical. Among putative variables, multivariate regression analysis showed that only the baseline number of SBIs (OR = 6.27, 95% CI 2.4-16.5) and simvastatin treatment (OR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.82) independently predicted the development of new brain infarcts.", 
    "12": "Consistent with findings of the epidemiological study, our study suggests that statins may prevent the development of a new brain infarct.", 
    "13": "Amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) is secreted as an apolipoprotein of nascent triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) derived from both liver and intestine, but is better recognized as the principal protein component of senile plaque in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies suggest that exaggerated exposure to plasma A\u03b2 can compromise cerebrovascular integrity, resulting thereafter in blood to brain delivery of plasma proteins including TRL-A\u03b2. Parenchymal deposits of A\u03b2 show significant immunoreactivity to apolipoprotein B (apo B), consistent with the notion of lipoprotein-A\u03b2 entrapment. In wild type mice chronically fed physiologically relevant diets, saturated fats (SFA) enhance chylomicron-A\u03b2 concomitant with disturbances in blood-brain barrier integrity. Similarly, dietary cholesterol promotes cerebrovascular extravasation of apo B lipoprotein-A\u03b2. In this study, we investigated the effects of atorvastatin, pravastatin and probucol on dietary-fat induced disturbances in BBB function. Atorvastatin, a lipid soluble HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor prevented SFA induced parenchymal extravasation of apo B-A\u03b2 at 28 days when incorporated into the diet at 20 mg/kg. In contrast, pravastatin a water soluble agent had no effect on BBB integrity at an equivalent dose. In cholesterol supplemented mice, probucol maintained BBB function and extravasation of apo B-A\u03b2 was not evident. The findings suggest that some lipid-modulating agents may be effective in ameliorating the negative effects of saturated fats and cholesterol on cerebrovascular integrity.", 
    "14": "Statins reduce cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality, but their effects on inflammation in atherosclerosis are not fully understood. We investigated whether statins can modulate cytotoxic functions of CD4 T cells in acute coronary syndrome (ACS).", 
    "15": "Fresh CD4 T cells were isolated from 55 patients with ACS without statin treatment on admission and from 34 age-matched controls. CD4 T cells collected from ACS patients induced endothelial cell apoptosis significantly more than control T cells. The TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptor DR5 was strongly upregulated on endothelial cells, and TRAIL-specific antibodies effectively blocked CD4 T cell-mediated apoptosis, indicating that T cell-mediated endothelial death was dependent on the TRAIL pathway. Expression of both the activating antigen CD69 and TRAIL was enhanced on ACS T cells. In in-vitro assays rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, and pitavastatin directly blocked CD4 T cell-mediated endothelial cell apoptosis and reduced T cell-expression of CD69 and TRAIL through TCR-induced Extracellar signal-Regulated Kinases (ERK) activation.", 
    "16": "Activated CD4 T cells expressing TRAIL are enriched in the blood of ACS patients and induce endothelial injury, which may contribute to the destabilization of the plaque. Early statin therapy may suppress T cell-mediated endothelial cell damage in atherosclerotic plaques and thus prevent cardiovascular events.", 
    "17": "Despite the wide contemporary availability of pharmacological and mechanical means of reperfusion, a very significant proportion of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients are still not offered any reperfusion therapy, and some of them are considered \"ineligible for reperfusion.\" Spontaneous reperfusion and contraindications to the use of fibrinolytics and/or mechanical reperfusion methods account only for a small part of these clinical situations. The boundary between \"timely\" and \"late\" presentation in STEMI, the appropriateness of percutaneous intervention in patients presenting late after onset of symptoms, and the impact of sex and age on the eligibility and/or choice of reperfusion therapy continue to be challenged by the most recent published data. In the current invasive-driven reperfusion era, if scientific evidence and clinical guidelines are applied diligently, the vast majority of eligible STEMI patients should receive reperfusion therapy. Pharmacological nonlytic therapy of patients with STEMI, regardless of the choice of reperfusion strategy or the absence of it, is clearly defined by the current practice guidelines. Available data suggest that for patients who do not receive any form of reperfusion, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin provides a clear additional mortality benefit versus placebo. Fondaparinux as compared with usual care (unfractionated heparin infusion or placebo) significantly reduces the composite of death or myocardial reinfarction without increasing severe bleeding or number of strokes. In the treatment of late-presenting patients with STEMI (beyond the first 12 h after onset of symptoms), clinical evaluation and risk stratification represent the crucial elements helping in decision making between therapeutic interventions.", 
    "18": "Some patients with aortic stenosis develop asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) that may influence the surgical approach and is associated with higher perioperative morbidity. The aim of this analysis was to characterize further this subtype of aortic stenosis patients.", 
    "19": "Baseline data in 1719 patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis, participating in the Simvastatin Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis study evaluating the effect of combined treatment with simvastatin and ezetimibe on progression of aortic stenosis was used. The study population was divided according to presence of ASH (interventricular septal/posterior wall thickness ratio >1.5). Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy was considered present if LV mass index > or =104 g/m(2) in women and > or =116 g/m(2) in men.", 
    "20": "ASH was present in 22% of patients and associated with higher LV mass index, total peripheral resistance and peak transaortic velocity and concomitant hypertension (all p<0.05). Thirty-four percent of patients with ASH had combined ASH and LV hypertrophy (asymmetric LV hypertrophy). These patients had higher systolic blood pressure, lower LV ejection fraction and larger left atrial diameter than patients with ASH only. In logistic regression analyses, hypertension was the most important predictor both for ASH (odds ratio, OR 1.38 [1.05-1.82]) and for asymmetric LV hypertrophy (OR 2.99 [1.71-5.25]), both p<0.05) independent of other covariates including severity of aortic stenosis.", 
    "21": "Hypertension is the main clinic characteristic of ASH and asymmetric LV hypertrophy in patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis independent of severity of aortic stenosis.", 
    "22": "Statins are drugs used to control cholesterol disorders and prevent cardiovascular diseases. Their denominated pleiotropic effects have demonstrated a broad action spectrum that might profit some neurological and neurosurgical diseases. These effects are correlated to dose and kind of statin. We accomplished a systematic review in PubMed and MEDLINE about studies of statins and main neurosurgical diseases. If statins are administered after subarachnoid hemorrhage, a significant lower incidence of vasospasm as well as delayed ischemic deficits and decreased mortality could be found; the results of a large multicenter trial are expected. In other complex diseases as intracerebral hemorrhage or traumatic brain injury, the evidence for positive effects of a treatment with statin increased. Additionally, promising experimental results indicate that high statin doses are able to promote cell death in tumor cells, especially in gliomas. Moreover, experimental and observational studies suggest the ability of statins to modulate the immune system, by that they can reduce incidence and severity of sepsis. The origin of these multiple effects from neuroprotection to tumoral apoptosis is not totally explained so far. Recent data in literature are discussed in this review. More trials in humans are urgently required to finally determine if statins could contribute to the current management of neurosurgical diseases.", 
    "23": "Several large observational studies or randomized controlled trials in the field of critical care nephrology have been completed and reported, or recently completed or have recently begun recruitment. These studies provide important information to guide our appreciation of current practice and consider new potentially effective intervention for the prevention or attenuation of acute kidney injury or suggest new avenues for the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the treatment of sepsis. In particular, two studies, the ATN study and the RENAL study (both multicenter randomized controlled trials of > 1,000 patients) provide, for the first time, level I evidence to guide the practice of RRT in critically ill patients and to better define the optimal intensity of such RRT in this setting. Clinicians practicing in the field of critical care nephrology need to be aware of these trials, their details, their findings or design or current recruitment rate and likely time of completion to continue to offer their patients the highest level of evidence-based medical care.",

    "29": "Simvastatin induced significant time- and concentration-dependent apoptotic effects on HES cells as determined by increased activity of executioner caspases and DNA fragmentation. Simvastatin also caused profound alterations in HES cell morphology and F-actin cytoskeleton. This effect was abrogated by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, an important product of the mevalonate pathway.",

    "31": "Current guidelines recommend statins as first-line therapy for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and preventing cardiovascular events. Patients taking statins frequently experience adverse effects during therapy. The first step is to determine whether the adverse effects are indeed related to statin therapy by statin dechallenge and rechallenge. Strategies for managing statin intolerance include changing statins, intermittent dosing, intensification of lifestyle modifications, and using other LDL-C-lowering agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and LDL apheresis in suitable patients. More controversial approaches include red yeast rice, coenzyme Q10, and vitamin D supplementation. New therapies for LDL-C lowering are in development.", 
    "32": "Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed nations. Inflammation plays an increasingly important role in the cardiovascular disease process. Recent statin trials have demonstrated a correlation between the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and cardiovascular risk. This review describes the results of changes in hsCRP in the major statin outcome trials and the concept of a \"dual target\" for both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hsCRP. The effect on hsCRP of combination statin therapy with ezetimibe, fenofibric acid, niacin, and colesevelam is reviewed. Although some statin combination therapies have additional effects on CRP and other atherogenic lipids, evidence for their effect on cardiovascular risk beyond statin monotherapy is lacking. Ongoing placebo-controlled trials investigating statin combination therapy versus statin monotherapy may provide additional clues to the role of additional changes in lipids versus markers of inflammation on cardiovascular risk reduction. Until these trials are completed, current evidence suggests focusing on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets.", 
    "33": "Inflammation plays an important role in atherogenesis and plaque vulnerability. Inflammatory-type markers have been evaluated for their association with atherosclerotic vascular disease and their ability to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2) (Lp-PLA(2)) is a vascular-specific inflammatory enzyme that increases the risk of CVD events and stroke approximately twofold. A consensus panel recently recommended the measurement of Lp-PLA(2) in moderate-risk and high-risk patients for improved risk stratification and modification of low-density lipoprotein target levels. Lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, lower Lp-PLA(2) mass and activity; therefore, Lp-PLA(2) may represent an important target of lipid-lowering therapy for reducing the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis and plaque vulnerability. It is unknown whether lowering inflammatory markers such as Lp-PLA(2) will have a direct benefit on CVD events and mortality. A large morbidity and mortality trial was recently initiated to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of darapladib, an Lp-PLA(2) antagonist, in patients with high-risk coronary heart disease.", 
    "34": "Considerable evidence has demonstrated that use of statins has a beneficial impact on both progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Accordingly, statins have been increasingly used in preventive strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk. More recent reports have demonstrated an incremental benefit with use of higher doses of statins and when used early in the setting of acute ischemic syndromes. Although lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is likely to underscore the majority of the clinical benefit, emerging evidence suggests that additional properties may also be important. In particular, a number of reports have demonstrated that modest elevations in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are likely to contribute to the benefit of statins. As a result, a favorable influence on the ratio of atherogenic and protective lipid species is likely to have the most profound impact on cardiovascular risk in statin-treated individuals.", 
    "35": "Coronary atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, accounting for close to 1 million deaths annually in the United States alone. The evaluation of coronary disease by CT-derived calcium scores is a rapidly evolving field of medical imaging. Furthermore, until recently, whether or not regression or progression of coronary disease could accurately be assessed by coronary calcium scores had been a question of considerable debate among experts in this field. If the medical treatment of coronary artery disease by statin pharmacotherapy could be accurately assessed by coronary calcium scoring, this would take much of the current guess work out of statin pharmacotherapy. Initial retrospective studies and observational data suggested that statin treatment resulted in reduction of coronary calcium. More recently, five randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that not only does statin treatment not reduce coronary calcium, but in fact, the progression of coronary calcium by CT scanning is indistinguishable from placebo treatment.", 
    "36": "Fibrocalcific aortic stenosis (AS) results from an active process similar to atherosclerosis that involves basement membrane disruption, lipid deposition, inflammatory cell infiltration, and calcification. Consequently, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been extensively studied as potential therapeutic agents capable of slowing the progression of AS. However, two randomized trials, SALTIRE and the SEAS study, showed no benefit with statin therapy for AS. These results have shed doubt over the efficacy of statin therapy for AS, although their potential efficacy at early stages of aortic valve disease remains possible. In this article, we review the pathophysiology of fibrocalcific AS and discuss future directions for its nonsurgical management in the post-SEAS era.", 
    "37": "The pathobiology of aortic stenosis (AS) now is recognized to have many similiarities to that of atherosclerosis, a disease in which lipid lowering therapy with statin drugs has been successful. Accordingly statins have been used to attempt to retard the progression of AS with variable success. The SEAS trial compared the effects of the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe to placebo in retarding the progression of aortic stenosis (AS) and was the largest randomized trial of such therapies. One thousand eight hundred seventy three patients with moderate AS were included. The group receiving the drugs had a large reduction in LDL cholesterol and a reduction in coronary events. However drug therapy had no effect on the progression of AS. Conclusion. While AS has many similarities to atherosclerosis, lipid lowering therapy does not affect progression of moderate to severe AS.",

    "39": "Fasting blood samples were obtained from 98 CAD patients. Metabolic syndrome and its components were defined using the diagnostic criteria of the International Diabetes Federation. Adiponectin concentrations were measured using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit.", 
    "40": "Fifty patients with CAD (51.0%) had metabolic syndrome. For this group of patients, fasting adiponectin concentrations were found to correlate inversely with metabolic syndrome (p=0.009). Fasting adiponectin values for these subjects also tended to decrease as the number of diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome increased (p=0.024). CAD patients with hyperlipidemia (p=0.002), obesity (p=0.030) or receiving statin therapy (p=0.005) had lower serum adiponectin values. By univariate linear regression analysis, fasting serum adiponectin values were positively correlated with age (r=0.242; p=0.017) and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration (HDL-cholesterol; r=0.267; p=0.008) but were negatively correlated with triglyceride concentration (TG; r=-0.251; p=0.013). Multivariate forward stepwise linear regression analysis of the significant variables revealed that HDL-cholesterol concentration (R square=0.071, p=0.008) and age (R square=0.039, p=0.044) are the independent predictors of fasting serum adiponectin concentration for patients with CAD.", 
    "41": "Serum adiponectin concentration is inversely correlated with metabolic syndrome and the number of metabolic syndrome criteria in patients with CAD. For these patients HDL-cholesterol concentration and age are independent predictors of the serum adiponectin value.", 
    "42": "Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, which are widely used to lower serum cholesterol levels in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Recent experimental and clinical evidence suggests that the beneficial effects of statins may extend beyond their cholesterol-lowering effects, to include so-called pleiotropic effects. These cholesterol-independent effects include improving endothelial function, attenuating vascular and myocardial remodeling, inhibiting vascular inflammation and oxidation, and stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques. The mechanism underlying some of these pleiotropic effects is the inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis by statins, which leads to the inhibition of intracellular signaling molecules Rho, Rac and Cdc42. In particular, inhibition of Rho and one of its downstream targets, Rho kinase, may be a predominant mechanism contributing to the pleiotropic effects of statins. The aim of the present review is to provide an update on the non-cholesterol-dependent statin effects in the cardiovascular system and highlight some of the recent findings from bench to bedside to support the concept of statin pleiotropy.", 
    "43": "Lipid profiles were evaluated for 281 dyslipidemia patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for 2 years. The efficacy and safety of ezetimibe 10 mg/day one-year add-on therapy were also retrospectively evaluated. The results show that in 281 dyslipidemia patients with a mean low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 120 mg/dl or greater, ezetimibe 10 mg/day administration reduced LDL-C levels to 90 mg/dl or below. Patients who had been treated with one of six statins (pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin) for one year were given ezetimibe add-on therapy for one year, which reduced their LDL-C levels by 18% (pravastatin), 25% (simvastatin), 27% (fluvastatin), 30% (pitavastatin), 29% (atorvastatin), and 31% (rosuvastatin). Also, during the one-year add-on therapy, no severe adverse event was detected. An analysis of associations among lipids during a two-year lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy revealed correlations in a single patient. The correlation was between LDL-C and small, dense LDL as well as mid-band lipoprotein cholesterol. In conclusion, ezetimibe 10mg/day add-on therapy may be safe and effective for treating dislipidemia patients who have been treated with a statin. Moreover, this article discusses the disappearance thresholds for small, dense LDL and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) by using the quantitative analysis of densitometric pattern based on genetic algorithm, which indicated that the major eight subspecies of lipoprotein (VLDL1, VLDL2, IDL1, IDL2, LDL1, LDL2, LDL3, HDL). The thershold for small dense LDL indicates the IDL1 plus IDL2 when LDL2 and LDL3 were not detectable, while the thershold for IDL indicates the LDL1 when IDL1, IDL2 and LDL3 were not detectable.", 
    "44": "Elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol are associated with increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis, and morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD). Lowering of LDL cholesterol leads to a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality in individuals at risk for cardiovascular events and patients with established CHD. The mainstays of lipid lowering therapy today are the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins); however, the residual risk of cardiovascular events amongst individuals treated with statins remains a major healthcare concern.", 
    "45": "Emerging targets for lipid lowering therapy target pathways that regulate lipoprotein assembly, lipoprotein clearance and pro-atherogenic lipoprotein modification. These emerging drugs have novel mechanisms that include inhibition of lipoprotein assembly (antisense mRNA inhibitors of apolipoprotein B and microsomal transfer protein inhibitors), enhanced lipoprotein clearance (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9, thyroid hormone analogues), inhibition of pro-atherogenic lipoprotein remodeling (cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors (dalcetrapib, anacetrapib) and peroxisome proliferator activator agents (GFT-505, aleglitazar)) and inhibition of lipoprotein modification (heme oxygenase-1 inhibitor (succinobucol), phospholipase A(2) inhibitors (varespladib, darapladib)).",

    "48": "The beneficial effects of losartan and rosuvastatin on neointimal formation have been well characterized, but little is known about the combined treatment benefit of these two drugs. This study was designed to investigate the synergistic effect of losartan combined with rosuvastatin on the magnitude of protective action in vascular injury mediated by cuff-induced neointimal formation model in vivo. Losartan at 20 mg/kg or rosuvastatin at 40 mg/kg significantly decreased both the neointimal formation and BrdU-positive cells in neointima, indicating the inhibition of cell proliferation including a progress of DNA synthesis. The combination treatment used lower doses of losartan with rosuvastatin (10 + 20 & 5 + 10 mg/kg, respectively) that proved to be significant in decreasing the neointimal formation and BrdU incorporation. These results were comparable to the diminution attained with monotherapy of either drug in higher doses. Interaction index measured by isobolar method indicated drug synergism in these two combinations of both drugs at lower doses. Therefore, the administration of losartan and rosuvastatin in combination with low doses synergistically decreased in cuff-induced neointimal formation by reducing cell proliferation, suggesting that this drug synergism may be fully effective with, lower adverse effects, for the treatment of vascular remodeling such as restenosis.", 
    "49": "Randomized trials have suggested that the beneficial effects of statins could extend to mechanisms beyond cholesterol reduction. Investigations have shown that statins are associated with reduced plasma markers of inflammation, reduced T-cell and monocyte activation, and reduced blood clotting. These effects could be explained by the inhibition of L-mevalonic acid synthesis, thus affecting cell-signalling pathways. However, it has been difficult to evaluate whether the nonlipid effects of statins translate into clinically meaningful outcomes.", 
    "50": "Inflammation, as measured by C-reactive protein (CRP), has been established as an independent cardiovascular risk factor, even in persons with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Statins have anti-inflammatory effects, and lower CRP. Reducing both LDL-cholesterol and CRP is important in order to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events. Statins significantly reduce the risk of venous thrombosis. It is probable that this effect goes beyond lipid lowering. The clinical benefit of statin therapy in infectious diseases remains to be determined by randomized controlled trials.",

    "60": "This review focuses on the non-statin strategies for the treatment of hyperlipidemias in humans. Even if statins remain the major hypolipidemic drugs at present, an increasing number of patients that are treated with statins raises as well the numbers of patients suffering from side effects or not responding well to the therapy. Thus, development of novel approaches to battle the world epidemics of hyperlipidemia remains relevant. The non-statin strategies include the decrease of cholesterol absorption from the diet, lowering the atherogenic lipoprotein release and increasing HDL levels, or increasing elimination of cholesterol by bile acid binding. Representative non-statin drugs that are on the market or are in development phases are described herein in comparison to statins. In addition to 3beta-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), as the major regulatory enzyme of cholesterol synthesis that is the target of statins, some other enzymes of this multi-step pathway represent perspective targets for the development of novel hypolipidemics. None of these inhibitors are currently approved for use in humans. We describe the characteristics of the later enzymes of cholesterol synthesis, starting from the squalene synthase step. Inhibitors of these enzymes are critically evaluated, particularly concerning safety in humans (teratogenic potential, toxicity, and other side effects) and their hypolipidemic effects compared to the statins. Since only a limited number of publications discuss the non-statin approaches for the treatment of hyperlipidemias, this review represents a valuable up-to date summary, with a take-home message, that novel approaches deserve more attention in the future, irrespective of the success of statins.", 
    "61": "Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A to mevalonate, a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Statins are able to reduce cardiovascular risk in hypercholesterolemic patients. In recent years, the possible effect of statins on bone tissue has received particular attention. The present study was undertaken to understand the events of osteoblast differentiation induced by statins. Our hypothesis is that simvastatin promotes osteoblast viability and differentiation via Ras/Smad/Erk/bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2 signaling pathway. The viability and differentiation of osteoblasts were examined by mitochondrial activity assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and gene expression. The associated signaling pathways were analyzed by cytoplasmic and membrane proteins manifestation. After administration of 10(-6) M simvastatin, the ALP activity was significantly enhanced, and the expression of BMP-2, ALP, sialoprotein, and type I collagen genes were up-regulated. After simvastatin treatment, both the RasGRF1 and phospho-RasGRF1 in the cytoplasm decreased significantly, whereas those on the plasma membrane increased. A marked increase in membranous GAP-associated protein (P190) and the activated form of both phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 and phospho-Smad1 were also noted. In conclusion, this study shows that statins pose a positive effect on the metabolism of osteoblasts. Simvastatin can promote osteoblast viability and differentiation via membrane-bound Ras/Smad/Erk/BMP-2 pathway. Statins stimulate osteoblast differentiation in vitro and may be a promising drug for the treatment of osteoporosis in the future.", 
    "62": "The beneficial effects of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been attributed not only to their cholesterol lowering effect but also to their pleiotropic actions and especially to their anti-oxidant activity. Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) is a transcription factor that orchestrates the transcriptional response of cells to oxidative stressors and electrophilic xenobiotics. In this study, primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild type or Nrf2 knock out C57BL6J mice and ST-2 cells were used to investigate the implication of Nrf2 in the mediation of the anti-oxidant effects of statins and the possible involvement of PI3K/Akt pathway in this process. We show for the first time that simvastatin lowers reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activating Nrf2 through the PI3K/Akt pathway.",

    "69": "Human articular chondrocytes and cartilage explants from osteoarthritic donors were exposed to simvastatin in the presence or absence of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta). Collagenase expression was determined by quantifying levels of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13) and MMP-1 mRNA and MMP-13 protein. The mechanism of statin action was tested by addition of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) or by using inhibitors of farnesyl transferase (FT) and geranylgeranyl transferase (GGT-1).",

MMP-13 protein secreted into the culture media was also decreased. Genes involved in cartilage synthesis (type II collagen and aggrecan) were not down-regulated by simvastatin. Exogenous addition of GGPP completely reversed the statin-mediated decrease in MMP-13 mRNA and protein levels whereas FPP partially reversed the statin-mediated effect. An inhibitor of GGT-1 mimicked the simvastatin-mediated reduction in MMP-13 expression by chondrocytes. Finally, consistent with impacts on MMP-13 and MMP-1 expression, simvastatin as well as the GGT-1 inhibitor both blocked type II collagen degradation in primary human articular cartilage explants.",

The assay involves a simple solid-phase extraction procedure of 0.25 mL human plasma and the analysis was performed on a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by MRM mode via electrospray ionization (ESI). The method was linear in the concentration range of 0.25-60.0 microg/mL. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.25 microg/mL. The within- and between-day precision and accuracy of the quality control samples were within 10.0%. The recovery was 95.1% and 94.4% for ethosuximide and pravastatin, respectively. The analysis time for each sample was 1.8 min. The method was highly reproducible and gave peaks with excellent chromatography properties.", 
    "73": "The increased mortality in patients with rheumathoid arthritis (RA) is mainly due to high incidence of cardiovascular (CV) disease. CV morbidity and mortality in RA can be explained by several mechanisms: (1) chronic inflammation, (2) enhanced prevalence of traditional CV risk factors including atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia, (3) a lower use of evidence-based therapy such as statins and (4) chronic treatment for RA such as glucocorticoids. It is difficult to distinguish between the role of pharmacological treatment per se and the severity or duration of the disease since these two parameters are closely interrelated. RA likely influences lipoprotein metabolism leading to quantitative and qualitative alteration of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and of high-density lipoproteins. Glucocorticoids alter carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. However, by reducing the inflammation level, the net effect on lipid parameters and on the CV risk may be favorable. Data from open follow-up studies would suggest that methotrexate use is associated with a beneficial effect on lipid parameters and with a reduction in the incidence of CV disease. Anti-TNF agents increase LDL-cholesterol in some but not all studies; however the use of anti-TNF agents likely reduce CV risk in patients with RA. The influence of recently developed compounds, anti-CD20, CTLA-4 Ig or anti-IL6 is not well documented. Anti-IL6 seem to increase total and LDL-cholesterol; however these changes are associated with an improvement in the TC/HDL-C ratio.",

Forty family physicians from each arm will be recruited to participate, and the medical records for 20 of their diabetic patients at high risk for CVD will be retrospectively reviewed. Outcome measures will be assessed for each patient between July 2009 and March 2010. The primary outcome will be that the patient is receiving a statin. Secondary outcomes will include 1) the receipt of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 2) various intermediate measures (A1c, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio, body mass index and waist circumference), and 3) clinical inertia (the failure to change therapy in response to an abnormal A1c, blood pressure or cholesterol reading). The analysis will be carried out using multilevel hierarchical logistic regression models to account for the clustered nature of the data. The group assignment will be a physician-level variable. In addition, a process evaluation study with six focus groups of family physicians will assess the acceptability of the CDA's Toolkit and will explore factors contributing to any change or lack of change in behaviour, from the perspectives of family physicians.",

Statins can increase the alpha-secretase activity by their cholesterol-lowering properties as well as by impairment of isoprenoids synthesis. In the present study, we elucidate the contribution of these pathways in alpha-secretase activation. We demonstrate that zaragozic acid, a potent inhibitor of squalene synthase which blocks cholesterol synthesis but allows synthesis of isoprenoids, also stimulates alpha-secretase activity. Treatment of human neuroblastoma cells with 50 microM zaragozic acid resulted in a approximately 3 fold increase of alpha-secretase activity and reduced cellular cholesterol by approximately 30%. These effects were comparable to results obtained from cells treated with a low lovastatin concentration (2 microM). Zaragozic acid-stimulated secretion of alpha-secretase-cleaved soluble AbetaPP was dose dependent and saturable. Lovastatin- or zaragozic acid-stimulated increase of alpha-secretase activity was completely abolished by a selective ADAM10 inhibitor. By targeting the alpha-secretase ADAM10 to lipid raft domains via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, we demonstrate that ADAM10 is unable to cleave AbetaPP in a cholesterol-rich environment. Our results indicate that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by a low lovastatin concentration is sufficient for alpha-secretase activation.",

A related issue, which remains unclear, is whether statins improve cognitive function. While some studies have shown a beneficial effect of statins on cognitive function, others have observed mild detrimental effects on cognition. Our aim was to assess cognitive function in community-dwelling elderly participants treated with statins compared with their untreated counterparts (i.e., controls) living in the same population. 137 population-dwelling participants who were receiving statins and 411 matched controls age 65 years (median=72 years) in central Spain (the Neurological Disorders in Central Spain [NEDICES] study) underwent a neuropsychological assessment, including tests of global cognitive performance, frontal-executive function, verbal fluency, and memory. Median duration of statin treatment was 2 years. Of 137 participants receiving statins, 53 (38.7%) were taking pravastatin, 38 (27.7%) simvastatin, 37 (27.0%) lovastatin, 6 (4.4%) fluvastatin, and 3 (2.2%) atorvastatin. Although initial univariate analyses indicated some differences, after adjusting for age, gender, education, depressive symptoms, premorbid intelligence, medications that potentially affect cognitive function, and blood cholesterol levels, statin users and controls performed similarly on all neuropsychological tests. In this population-based sample, elderly participants treated with statins and untreated controls performed similarly in all tested cognitive areas.

    "109": "Coadministration of statins and fibrates is beneficial in some patients by allowing simultaneous reduction of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol alongside elevation of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, the potential for drug interactions must be taken into consideration. Gemfibrozil increases systemic exposure to various different statins, whereas similar effects are not observed with fenofibrate, suggesting it may be a more appropriate choice for coadministration with statins. Gemfibrozil is reported to cause a moderate increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of atorvastatin, but the effect of fenofibrate on atorvastatin pharmacokinetics has not been described. This study compared the effects of multiple-dose administration of gemfibrozil and fenofibrate on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin. Gemfibrozil coadministration led to significant increases in the AUC of atorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone, and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone. In contrast, fenofibrate administration did not lead to clinically meaningful changes in the AUC for atorvastatin, atorvastatin lactone, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin, or 2-hydroxyatorvastatin lactone. The absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction between fenofibrate and atorvastatin is consistent with recent results showing no difference in safety profile between atorvastatin as monotherapy or in combination with fenofibric acid. Together, these data suggest that atorvastatin-fenofibrate combination therapy is unlikely to pose a risk to patients.",

This is an investigator-initiated, single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study. Asymptomatic subjects at low risk of cardiovascular events defined as <10% 10-year risk based on the Framingham Risk Score will be recruited, if they do not qualify for lipoprotein-lowering therapy based on the National Cholesterol Education Panel Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines.

We investigated the physiological function of Nur77 on proliferation in VSMCs and the effects of atorvastatin on the expression of Nur77. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a key growth factor mediating VSMC proliferation in atherogenesis and post-angioplasty restenosis, was employed to induce the transcriptional regulation of Nur77 expression in VSMCs and rat carotid artery post-angioplasty restenosis models were used to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on the expression of Nur77 by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and western blot methods. In cell models, we found that PDGF-B induced Nur77 mRNA expression and protein expression through ERK-MAPK-dependent signaling pathways, and atorvastatin attenuated the expression of Nur77 induced by PDGF-B. In the rat model, our data showed Nur77 was up-regulated in neointima, but down-regulated by atorvastatin. Our results indicate that Nur77 promotes VSMC proliferation, and down-regulation of Nur77 by atorvastatin suggests a novel therapy strategy for atherogenesis based on suppression of VSMC proliferation.",

Our objective was to evaluate the capacity of atorvastatin to reduce plasma levels of interferon-regulated chemokines (CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL9) and to study the correlation between these chemokines and disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Eighty-eight female patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were divided into two groups: 64 receiving 20 mg/day of atorvastatin (intervention group) and 24 without atorvastatin (control group). All patients were followed for 8 weeks. At baseline and after 8 weeks laboratory tests were performed for all patients. Plasma levels of chemokines were measured by ELISA using commercial kits (DuoSet, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA). In a univariate analysis we found correlation between CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL9 plasma levels and SLEDAI score. In the intervention group we observed a significant decrease in CXCL9 plasma levels comparing baseline and levels at the end of the study (p = 0.04); however, no differences were observed regarding CCL2 or CCL3 plasma levels in this study. No significant difference was observed in the plasma levels of these chemokines in the control group. We conclude that treatment with atorvastatin was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma levels of CXCL9 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. As the plasma levels of CXCL9 correlated with the SLEDAI score, we ask whether reducing levels of this chemokine could help to control systemic lupus erythematosus activity.", 
    "133": "Statins are widely used drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. A number of recent studies have suggested that statins also have pleiotropic effects on immune responses and statins have proven to be effective in the treatment of autoimmune diseases in animal models. Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells are a unique subset of CD4(+) T cells that mediate immunosuppression. Foxp3(+) T cells develop in the thymus, but can also be induced in peripheral sites in the presence of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We demonstrate here that simvastatin blockade of the mevalonate pathway can mediate induction of mouse Foxp3(+) T cells and that simvastatin can synergize with low levels of TGF-beta to induce Foxp3(+) T cells. The effects of simvastatin are secondary to a blockade of protein geranylgeranylation, are mediated at late time-points after T-cell activation, and are associated with demethylation of the Foxp3 promoter. One major effect of simvastatin was inhibition of the induction of Smad6 and Smad7, inhibitory Smads that inhibit TGF-beta signalling. Our results suggest that one mechanism responsible for the immunosuppressive effects of statins is the ability to promote the generation of Foxp3(+) T regulatory cells.", 
    "134": "The inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) has been proposed as a novel instrument to assess cardiovascular risk, to determine the need for statin therapy in specific individual otherwise not deemed to meet current criteria, and to represent a potential target of treatment. CRP is predominantly secreted by the liver and adipose tissues in response to inflammatory stress and is regulated, in great part, by interleukin-6. The issues of CRP as a causal factor (rather than a biomarker) has been addressed by three types of studies: animal models, in which CRP was injected; transgenic mice over-expressing human CRP; and Mendelian randomization studies. All indicate that CRP may not have a direct role in promoting atherosclerosis but, instead, serves as a marker of vascular inflammation and the presence of atherosclerosis. Several clinical studies have shown that individuals reaching both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and hsCRP targets (LDL-C less than 2.0 mmol/L and hsCRP less than 2 mg/L) have the lowest event rate, suggesting that hsCRP may become a secondary target of treatment after LDL-C. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study showed that apparently healthy men and women with elevated hsCRP, but normal LDL-C (less than 3.4 mmol/L), had an overall 44% reduction in the primary end points with rosuvastatin 20 mg/day. The results of this study have now been incorporated in the new Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "135": "Statin therapy in patients with cardiovascular disease is associated with reduced incidence of stroke. The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction of Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial showed daily treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin in patients with a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) reduced the incidence of fatal or nonfatal stroke by 16%. Several post hoc analyses of different subgroups followed the SPARCL study. They have not revealed any significant differences when patients were sorted by age, sex, presence of carotid disease or type of stroke, with the exception of intracranial hemorrhage as the entry event. Lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in addition to possible neuroprotective mechanisms due to atorvastatin treatment correlate with improved risk reduction. Although not predefined subgroups and subject to an insufficient power, these post hoc studies have generated new clinical questions. However, clinicians should avoid denying therapy based on such subgroup analysis. At this point, the best evidence powerfully demonstrates stroke and TIA patients should be prescribed high dose statin therapy for secondary stroke prevention.", 
    "136": "Raynaud's phenomenon is a clinical disorder with episodic digital ischemic vasospasm triggered by cold- or emotional-stress. It was first mentioned by Maurice Raynaud in 1862 describing \"a local asphyxia of the extremities\" and was further divided into primary Raynaud's disease and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, which is often related to connective tissue diseases, but also physical or chemical strain. Though pathophysiology of Raynaud's phenomenon is still poorly understood, systemic and local vascular effects are most likely to be involved in primary Raynaud's disease. In secondary Raynaud's phenomenon additional abnormalities in vascular structure and function may play the major role. Thus, medical treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon remains unsatisfactory, due to limited understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms. This review addresses current evidence for medical treatment of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon with regard to pathophysiological mechanisms as well as future perspectives.", 
    "137": "Statins have been widely used for the treatment of a variety of conditions beyond their original role in lowering cholesterol. Since statins have relatively few side effects, they have been recognized as useful medicine to ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders. Current studies on the applications of statins have demonstrated their neuroprotective and clinical significance among neurodegenerative diseases like cerebral ischemic stroke, vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, though the neuroprotective mechanisms are not completely understood. This review will discuss recent development in the use of statins in slowing down the progression of these neurodegenerative diseases. It will summarize the potential mechanisms for statin-mediated neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative diseases. In detail, this review discuss the roles of statins in lowering cholesterol, reducing reactive oxygen species, impairing \u03b2-amyloid production and serum apolipoprotein E levels, enhancing the levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cerebral blood flow, and modulating cognitive related receptors and matrix metalloproteases. Finally, different alterations of various receptors in brain regions following statin treatment and their correlations with cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease will also be reviewed, as well as the potential for therapy in ameliorating the progression of Parkinson's disease.

    "138": "To examine the in vivo effects of atorvastatin (AT) on arterial calcification in rats, arterial calcification was established by subcutaneous injection of vitamin D3 and Warfarin. Intragastric administration of AT began 4 days before establishment of arterial calcification in the AT group (n=6). Blood samples were taken and abdominal aortas were collected and stained. After induction of calcification, plasma Ca(2+) levels in the CA and AT groups were significantly higher than those before treatment and in the untreated controls. Plasma Ca(2+) levels in the AT group were significantly lower than in the CA group. The relative calcification area in aortic specimens from the AT group was significantly smaller than in the CA group. Rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VMSC) were isolated from abdominal aortic segments and pre-treated with AT (1, 5, or 10 \u03bcM) for 24 hr. Cells in the calcification (CA) group and the AT group were cultured with \u03b2-glycerophosphate, insulin and vitamin C for 14 days to induce cell calcification. Calcium deposition and alkaline phosphatase activity were significantly increased in the CA group compared to untreated controls (p<0.01). This effect was ameliorated by AT (all p<0.01). In vivo administration of AT reduced arterial calcification and plasma Ca(2+) concentration. In vitro, AT reduced calcification markers in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells.", 
    "139": "The fibric acid derivative, fenofibrate (FF) has been used in the US since 1998 to manage patients with dyslipidemia. Typical changes in serum lipids as result a of FF treatment include clinically important mean reductions of serum triglycerides (TG) by a mean change of -93.7 mg/dL (-39.3%), increases of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) by +5.5 mg/dL (+12.4%), and reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) by -17.9 mg/dL (-12.3%). The greatest reductions in serum TG are usually observed in subjects with elevated baseline TGs including those with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Although statins remain the mainstay of therapy for most dyslipidemic patients, their combined use with FF would be expected to address residual risk resulting from less than optimal TG and HDLC levels in such patients. Clinical trials examining the cardiovascular benefits of FF alone or combined with statins have produced mixed results. These observations underscore our lack of understanding of which patients may benefit from FF therapy and which do not. Although FF's basic mechanism of action is known to involve PPAR-alpha agonist activity resulting in altered transcription of several genes, the actual genetic bases for variability in lipid response is poorly understood. Studies, such as our GOLDN study and others designed to better understand the genetic determinants of variability in the response to FF treatment and lipid levels. As a result several important genetic determinants of lipid levels have been identified. For example, in the GOLDN study SNPs from different genes were significantly associated with baseline lipid levels before treatment (APOA5- rs662799, rs3135506; APOC3- rs5128, rs2854117, rs4520); APOA4- rs5104; PPARA- rs9626730, rs135543, rs11703495; LPL- rs1801177), after treatment PPARA- rs11708495; LPL- rs1801177, and appeared to modulate overall response to FF treatment (NOS3- rs1799983). In this article, we will review the literature leading up to the contemporary use of FF as an agent to manage patients with dyslipidemia and focus on emerging understanding of the genetic variability in response to FF treatment. On the basis of the available evidence, we conclude that FF is of benefit in the treatment of dyslipidemia, especially among those with MetS. However, more work is needed to specifically identify which individuals derive a benefit from FF administration in terms of clinical outcomes and which do not - particularly in the context of type 2 diabetes.",

    "152": "Statins are widely prescribed for cardiovascular disease prevention and also commonly used in patients at high risk for colorectal cancer. We report the results of a planned secondary analysis of the relationship between statin use and colorectal adenoma risk in a large chemoprevention trial. The Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib (APC) trial randomized 2,035 adenoma patients to receive placebo (679 patients), 200 mg celecoxib twice daily (bid; 685 patients), or 400 mg celecoxib bid (671 patients). The study collected complete medical history and medication use data and performed colonoscopic surveillance to 5 years after study enrollment. The effects of statin use on newly detected adenomas and cardiovascular adverse events were analyzed as time-dependent variables by multivariable Cox regression. Statins were used by 36% (n = 730) of APC trial participants.

Statin use for >3 years increased adenoma risk over 5 years (risk ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.86; P = 0.024). For all comparisons of patients treated with celecoxib, adenoma detection rates for statin users and nonusers were equivalent.

Long-term use of statins is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in some, but not all, studies. We genotyped variants in 40 candidate genes important for cholesterol synthesis and metabolism in a population-based case-control study of CRC involving 2,138 incident cases and 2,049 population-based controls. We identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the HMGCR gene that significantly modified the protective association between statins and CRC risk. Compared with nonusers, the unadjusted odds ratio of CRC among statin users with the A/A genotype of rs12654264 in HMGCR was 0.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.51) and among statin users with the T/T genotype was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.06; P-interaction = 0.0012). This genetic variant (A/A genotype of rs12654264) also was associated with lower serum levels of low-density lipoprotein among all cases and controls. In colon cancer cell lines, the reduction in cholesterol levels after statin treatment was substantially stronger in cells carrying the A/A genotype, and this difference was related to alternative splicing involving the HMGCR statin-binding domain. We anticipate that these data may advance the development of personalized statin use for reducing the risk of cancer as well as cardiovascular disease among the approximately 25 million people currently using statins worldwide.",

Hypercholesterolemia is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and statin therapy has led to a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality from adverse cardiac events, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease. In addition to achieving a therapeutic decrease in serum cholesterol levels, statin therapy appears to promote other effects that are independent of changes in serum cholesterol. These ''pleiotropic'' effects include attenuation of vascular inflammation, improved endothelial cell function, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque, decreased vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, and inhibition of platelet aggregation.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether pravastatin therapy reduced primary end point events in KIF6 719Arg carriers and noncarriers, separately, in the combined ethnic groups of CARE. The effect of pravastatin therapy on primary end point events (fatal coronary event or nonfatal myocardial infarction) was investigated in Cox regression models that adjusted for population structure using either self-reported ethnicity or the principal components of genetic heterogeneity. After adjustment for age, gender, and self-reported ethnicity, pravastatin therapy reduced events in carriers of KIF6 719Arg (hazard ratio [HR] 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49 to 0.83) but not in noncarriers (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.45) (p for interaction = 0.049). After adjustment for age, gender, traditional risk factors, and principal components, pravastatin therapy reduced events in carriers of 719Arg (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.85) but not in noncarriers (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.32) (p for interaction = 0.14). In conclusion, in an analysis that included CARE patients of all ethnic groups, pravastatin therapy significantly and substantially reduced primary end point events in carriers of the KIF6 719Arg allele but not in noncarriers.", 
    "158": "Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have established the efficacy of statins for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The benefits observed are often framed in terms of percentage reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline or percentage reductions between control and treatment groups, although epidemiologic data suggest that the absolute intergroup difference in LDL cholesterol (DeltaLDL(Control-Rx)) is the more informative measure. A systematic review of large-scale trials of statins versus placebo, usual care, or active (lower dose statin) control was conducted to calculate updated summary estimates of risk reduction in coronary artery disease and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analysis was used to ascertain the relations of different LDL cholesterol metrics to outcomes. In 20 eligible RCTs, there were significant overall reductions for coronary artery disease (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.78) and mortality (odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.94), but with substantial variability in trial results. DeltaLDL(Control-Rx) was the strongest determinant of coronary artery disease risk reduction, particularly after excluding active-comparator studies, and was independent of baseline LDL cholesterol. In contrast, baseline LDL cholesterol edged out DeltaLDL(Control-Rx) as the strongest determinant of mortality, but neither was significant after the exclusion of active-comparator studies. The exclusion of 3 RCTs involving distinct populations, however, rendered DeltaLDL(Control-Rx) the predominant determinant of mortality reduction. In conclusion, these findings underscore the primacy of absolute reductions in LDL cholesterol in the design and interpretation of RCTs of lipid-lowering therapies and in framing treatment recommendations on the basis of the proved coronary benefits of these drugs.", 
    "159": "Chronically hemodialyzed (HD) patients frequently suffer from quantitative and even more often qualitative serum lipids disorders. Mostly they have increased triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol, slightly increased or normal total and LDL-cholesterol and decreased HDL-cholesterol concentrations. The study compared lipid profile between two groups of chronic HD patients coming from regionally distinct areas, the continental and the maritime one. The aim was to examine the hypothetic influence of their different dietary habits on lipid profile. The study included 72 patients from continental region (39 men) and 50 from maritime part of the country (30 men). Patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, liver disease, alcoholics as well as sevelamer treated patients were not included. Prior to a HD session the patients were determined fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, total proteins, albumins and C-reactive protein serum concentrations. All patients were undergoing bicarbonate hemodialysis with polysulphone dialysers of low permeability. The continental group of patients were somewhat older, undergoing HD for longer period of time, of lower height, greater weight, greater body mass index, higher total (4.70 +/- 0.91:4.42 +/- 1.02 mmol/L), and LDL-cholesterol (2.78 +/- 0.74:2.66 +/- 0.75 mmol/L) concentrations, while lower triglycerides (1.72 +/- 0.84:1.81 +/- 0.83 mmol/L) and HDL-cholesterol (1.13 +/- 0.42:1.16 +/- 0.54 mmol/L). However all the differences were without statistical significance. Chi-square test showed that the continental group of patients consumed more often pork, bacon, smoked and cured meats, margarine, butter, walnuts, almonds, garlic, cream and full-fat cheese than fish. They prepare food more often with lard and sunflower oil. Almost every fourth continental patient received statins, while only every 25th in the maritime group of patients. There were not any statistically significant Chi-square values for differences in frequencies of patients with total cholesterol greater than 5.2 mmol/L, triglycerides above 1.6 mmol/L, HDL-cholesterol less than 1.1 mmol/L, LDL-cholesterol greater than 2.6 mmol/L, obesity and malnutrition between the two groups. Based on the results of this study we have concluded that diet has significant influence on lipid profile of HD patients. Even though the continental and the maritime groups of patients differed significantly in diet, they were similar in plasmatic lipoprotein concentrations. However, this similarity was ascribed only to statin treatment, which was more frequent in the continental group of patients. The influence of ESRD and HD as a method of renal replacement therapy on lipid profile was not more dominant than diet.",

A state of chronic inflammation and adipocytokine imbalance may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Statins, which are commonly used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, are known to possess anti-inflammatory effects. Statins also exert chemopreventive properties against various cancers. The present study examined the effects of pitavastatin, a recently developed lipophilic statin, on the development of azoxymethane (AOM)-initiated colonic premalignant lesions in C57BL/KsJ-db/db (db/db) obese mice. Male db/db mice were administrated weekly subcutaneous injections of AOM (15 mg/kg body weight) for 4 weeks and then were subsequently fed a diet containing 1 ppm or 10 ppm pitavastatin for 8 weeks. Feeding with either dose of pitavastatin significantly reduced the number of colonic premalignant lesions, beta-catenin accumulated crypts, by inhibiting proliferation and the surrounding inflammation. Pitavastatin increased the serum levels of adiponectin while conversely decreasing the serum levels of total cholesterol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-18, and leptin. Pitavastatin also caused a significant increase in the expression of phosphorylated form of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) protein on the colonic mucosa of AOM-treated mice. In addition, the expression levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-18, and COX-2 mRNAs on the colonic mucosa of AOM-treated mice were decreased by treatment with this agent. These findings suggest that pitavastatin attenuates chronic inflammation and improves the imbalance of adipocytokines, both of which are caused by the presence of excess adipose tissues, thereby preventing the development of colonic premalignancies in an obesity-related colon cancer model. Therefore, some types of statins, including pitavastatin, may be a useful chemoprevention modality for colon cancer in obese individuals.",

Hyperlipidemia in male and female mice was characterized by increased serum concentration of cholesterol and, especially, triglycerides. The observed changes were more pronounced in female mice. Administration of atorvastatin decreased cholesterol (but not triglyceride) level in intact males, but had no effect on these parameters in females; chitotriosidase activity increased in male and female mice, while activity of matrix metalloproteinases increased only in males. Administration of atorvastatin produced similar effects in male and female mice with moderate hyperlipidemia: decrease in the concentration of cholesterol and, particularly, of triglycerides. Activities of matrix metalloproteinases and chitotriosidase increased in males and females, this increase being more pronounced in males. The existence of a negative correlation between cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and activities of matrix metalloproteinases and chitotriosidase in males suggests that these enzymes can serve as a therapeutic target during hyperlipidemia.",

Particular attention has been paid to Toll-like receptor 4, the receptor for Gram-negative bacteria outer membrane lipopolysaccharide or endotoxin. Since most of the clinical trial targeting single inflammatory cytokine in the treatment of sepsis failed, therapeutic targeting of Toll-like receptor 4, because of its central role, looks promising.

An ever increasing number of individuals in modern Western Society are regularly consuming diets high in fat which promote the development of hypercholesterolemia. Additionally, modern societies are becoming increasingly aged, causing a collision between increased hypercholesterolemia and increased aging, which will likely lead to the development of increased pathological conditions due to hypercholesterolemia, thereby promoting deleterious neurochemical and behavioral changes in the brain. Lastly, while beneficial in controlling cholesterol levels, the long-term use of statins itself may potentially promote adverse effects on brain homeostasis, although specifics on this remain largely unknown. This review will focus on linking the current understanding of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (as well as statin use) to the development of oxidative stress, neurochemical alterations, and cognitive disturbances in the aging brain."
