A total of 78 patients had at least 2 visits to the clinic and were included in this analysis (61.5% were women; mean age 56 years). Among those initially above target, a significant reduction was achieved in mean hemoglobin A(1c) (0.96%; P < .01), systolic BP (15.84 mm Hg; P < .05), diastolic BP (7.16 mm Hg; P < .001), and low-density lipoprotein (0.62 mmol/L; P < .01) levels. There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients with clinical indications who were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (42.4%; P < .01), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker medications (35.9%; P < .01), or statin therapy (35.9%; P < .01).",

    "7": "Simvastatin suppresses myoblast differentiation via inhibition of Rac GTPase, which is involved in the mevalonic acid pathway that produces cholesterol. Statins also inhibit adipogenic differentiation and receptor activator of NF\u03baB ligand (RANKL) expression, possibly through the mevalonic acid pathway, although the involvement of that pathway and effector proteins in these cellular events has not been fully clarified. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of the effects of simvastatin on adipogenic differentiation and calcitriol-induced RANKL expression in bone marrow stromal ST2 cells. Adipogenesis and mRNA up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein were induced by troglitazone, and those events were efficiently inhibited by simvastatin. In addition, RANKL expression induced by calcitriol was abrogated by simvastatin in ST2 cells. The inhibitory effects of simvastatin were adequately compensated by the addition of either mevalonic acid or an intermediate of the mevalonic acid pathway, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by another intermediate, farnesyl pyrophosphate. These findings suggest that protein geranylgeranylation is related to cellular differentiation in those two directions. Furthermore, inhibitor analysis demonstrated that Rac GTPase is involved in adipogenic differentiation, whereas Rho GTPase was found to be involved in RANKL expression. Taken together, the present findings suggest that geranylgeranylation of Rho family GTPase is involved in both adipogenesis and RANKL expression of stromal cells, while Rac GTPase is involved in adipogenesis and Rho GTPase in RANKL expression.",

    "12": "Dental surgery is very common, and it is important for our dental colleagues to understand the medical history and chronic medications of our co-managed patients. Antibiotic prophylaxis is currently recommended only for patients at high risk for infective endocarditis when undergoing high-risk dental procedures. Good dental hygiene can prevent more infective endocarditis than prophylactic antibiotic therapy, as transient bacteraemia is common in daily activities such as the brushing and flossing of teeth. Most dental surgeries can generally be performed on patients taking a daily dose of aspirin, but the dentist must be able to assess the risk-benefit ratio of employing local measures of haemostasis versus stopping the antiplatelet therapy. Patients on antiplatelet with recent coronary artery stenting should be referred to their primary cardiologist regarding the cessation of these agents before any surgery.", 
    "13": "Despite the efficacy of statin therapy, patients treated with these agents face substantial residual risk that is associated with achieved levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). These observations suggest a potential benefit of additional strategies to promote further LDL-C reduction. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has emerged as an attractive target in this regard. Abrogation of PCSK9 function prevents PCSK9-mediated catabolism of LDL receptors, increases cell surface LDL receptor density, and promotes clearance of LDL and other atherogenic lipoproteins from the circulation. Thus far, the most advanced approaches to block PCSK9 action are monoclonal antibodies and anti-sense oligonucleotides. Among statin-treated patients, these agents may produce additional LDL-C lowering exceeding 50\u00a0%. In rare genetic experiments of nature, individuals with dominant negative or dual loss of function mutations of PCSK9 appear to have no adverse health effects resulting from lifelong, very low levels of LDL-C. In short-term trials, PCSK9 antibodies have been generally well-tolerated. However, evidence to support long-term safety and efficacy of PCSK9 therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk awaits the results of large cardiovascular outcome trials.", 
    "14": "Although statin-induced regression in coronary atherosclerosis seems to be greater in patients with acute coronary syndrome than in those with stable coronary artery disease, no reports have examined this. The purpose of the present study was to compare the changes in coronary atherosclerosis in patients with stable versus unstable angina pectoris (AP). The effects of 8-month statin therapy on coronary atherosclerosis were evaluated using virtual histology intravascular ultrasound, and analyzable intravascular ultrasound data were obtained from 119 patients (83 patients with stable AP and 36 with unstable AP). A significant decrease in plaque volume was observed in patients with unstable AP (-2.2%, p = 0.02) but not in patients with stable AP. A significant increase in the necrotic-core component (0.30 mm(3)/mm, p = 0.009) was observed only in patients with unstable AP. Significant positive correlations were observed between the percentage of change in platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase and the percentage of change in plaque volume (r = 0.346, p = 0.05) in patients with unstable AP. No significant correlations were observed in patients with stable AP. Multivariate regression analyses showed that a reduction in platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase was associated with regression in coronary atherosclerosis, particularly of the fibrous component (\u03b2 = 0.443, p = 0.003), in patients with unstable AP. In conclusion, regression of the coronary artery plaque volume was greater, although statin therapy did not halt the increases in plaque vulnerability, in patients with unstable AP compared to those with stable AP. A reduction in the serum platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase level was associated with regression in coronary atherosclerosis, particularly the fibrous plaque volume, in patients with unstable AP.",

Increased cellular uptake of retinol and altered actions of RA related to reduced expression of CRABP2 may contribute to the development of endometriosis. Recently statins have been shown to inhibit growth of human endometrial stromal (HES) cells and to reduce the number and size of endometriotic implants in experimental models of this disorder.",

    "28": "Metabolic syndrome is not a discrete entity with a single pathogenesis, but different complex mechanisms, especially those inducing oxidative stress, play a major role in the genesis of this condition. This consideration suggests that treatment of recognized cardiovascular risk factors alone cannot be enough to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with a diagnosed metabolic syndrome. However, it has been reported that oxidative stress is involved in the transduction of the effects of haemodynamic and metabolic pathological conditions. Thus, drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers], or on the glucose or lipid metabolism as substrate of oxidative mechanisms (statins and nutraceuticals) in association with a dietary restriction may be taken in account, because they play a synergistic effect in preventing functional and structural changes responsible for the high cardiovascular risk in metabolic syndrome.", 
    "29": "Resveratrol is a major constituent of traditional Asian medicinal herbs and red wine and is suggested to be a potential antiatherosclerotic drug due to its proposed hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether resveratrol protects against atherosclerosis development in APOE*3-Leiden.CETP (E3L.CETP) mice and adds to the antiatherogenic effect of mild statin treatment, currently the most widely used antiatherogenic therapy. E3L.CETP mice were fed a cholesterol-rich diet without (control) or with resveratrol (0.01% w/w), atorvastatin (0.0027% w/w) or both for 14 weeks. During the study plasma lipid, inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters were determined. Resveratrol reduced atherosclerotic lesion area (-52%) in the aortic root, comparable to atorvastatin (-40%) and the combination of both drugs (-47%). The collagen/macrophage ratio in the atherosclerotic lesion, a marker of plaque stability, was increased by resveratrol (+108%), atorvastatin (+124%) and the combination (+154%). Resveratrol decreased plasma cholesterol levels (-19%) comparable to atorvastatin (-19%) and the combination (-22%), which was completely confined to (very)low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in all groups. Post hoc analyses showed that the antiatherogenic effect of atorvastatin could be explained by cholesterol lowering, while the antiatherosclerotic effect of resveratrol could be attributed to factors additional to cholesterol lowering. Markers of inflammation and oxidative stress were not different, but resveratrol improved macrophage function. We conclude that resveratrol potently reduces atherosclerosis development and induces a more stable lesion phenotype in E3L.CETP mice. However, under the experimental conditions tested, resveratrol does not add to the antiatherogenic effect of atorvastatin.",

Adiponectin and leptin serum levels were lower in APP-Tg mice than in non-Tg mice. Treatment with statins reduced the number of AGE-positive neurons from as early as 10 M, preserved the numbers of 4-HNE- and LDL-R-positive neurons and the amount of IR-positive endothelium at 15 M, and reduced the sum of ApoE-positive SP size and adiponectin serum level at 20 M.",

For atorvastatin calcium, dutasteride, and sorafenib tosylate, there were 2.8-, 326-, and 46.4-fold increases in solubility, respectively. For dutasteride, a promising 4.7-fold increase for in vivo oral drug absorption in the entrapped nanomatrix was observed as compared to the free physical mixture, supported by statistical significance testing of pharmacokinetic parameters.", 
    "39": "Statin drugs inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, which reduces the synthesis of both cholesterol and isoprenoids (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate), with the latter being lipid molecules responsible for the posttranslational modification of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rho. Effects of statins, independent of lowering blood cholesterol levels, are thought to occur by inhibition of Rho/Rho kinase. The Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 has been reported to increase both erythrocyte deformability and low O2 tension-induced ATP release. Here, we tested the hypothesis that by inhibiting Rho/Rho kinase, simvastatin would increase both erythrocyte deformability and low O2 tension-induced ATP release. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups, control or simvastatin treated [simvastatin-supplemented chow (0.02%)], for 4 wk. Simvastatin treatment increased rat erythrocyte deformability compared with controls (n = 6, P < 0.05). However, erythrocytes of simvastatin-treated rats (n = 9, P < 0.05) exhibited impaired low O2 tension-induced ATP release. Similarly, the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-2133 (10 \u03bcM) also increased deformability and impaired low O2 tension-induced ATP release in healthy human erythrocytes (P < 0.05). Interestingly, ATP release in response to mastoparan 7 (n = 7, P < 0.05), which directly activates Gi, and isoproterenol (n = 5, P < 0.05), which signals through Gs, was not altered by incubation with GGTI-2133. These results suggest that although statins increase erythrocyte deformability, likely by inhibiting geranylgeranylation, the finding that both statins and a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor attenuated low O2 tension-induced ATP release demonstrates that factors in addition to erythrocyte deformability are critical for ATP release in response to this physiological stimulus.", 
    "40": "Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and NF-\u03baB play central roles in mediating signal transduction of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily in human macrophages. The feedback regulation of LDL receptor (LDLR) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoAR) are mediated by the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP)-SREBP2 pathway and are key regulatory elements for cholesterol homeostasis in human cells. This study was designed to investigate cross-talk between TLR4-MyD88-NF-\u03baB and SCAP-SREBP2 pathways in macrophage foam cell formation. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated THP-1 macrophages were transfected with negative control or MyD88 small interfering (si)RNA. Transfected cells were incubated with LPS in the absence or presence of LDL or I\u03baB kinase (IKK) inhibitor (BMS-345541). Intracellular cholesterol content was assessed. mRNA and protein expression of LDLR, HMG-CoAR, SCAP, and SREBP2 were examined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Intracellular translocation of SCAP in the organelles was detected by immunofluorecence and confocal microscopy. We demonstrated that LPS-induced cholesterol accumulation was attenuated by applying siRNA against MyD88 in the absence or presence of LDL. LPS increased both gene and protein expression of LDLR and HMG-CoAR by increasing expression and abnormal translocation of SCAP from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. These effects were blocked by knockdown of MyD88 or blockade of IKK or by knockdown of SCAP, suggesting that the cross-talk between NF-\u03baB and SCAP plays an important role in macrophage foam cell formation and that interfering with the cross-talk might be a potential approach in preventing LPS-induced macrophage foam cell formation.",

Similar results were obtained for hydroxyacid simvastatin. Independent of almorexant dose and relative time of administration, AUC0-\u221e and Cmax of atorvastatin increased (ratios ranged from 1.1 to 1.5).

These compounds are known to prevent and/or protect against cell death mediated by oxidative mitochondrial damage induced by a variety of conditions, either in vivo or in vitro. The results provide evidence that simvastatin induced MPT and cell necrosis were sensitive to either l-carnitine or piracetam in a dose-dependent fashion and mediated by additive mechanisms. When combined, l-carnitine and piracetam acted at concentrations significantly lower than they act individually. These results shed new light into both the cytotoxic mechanisms of statins and the mechanisms underlying the protection against MPT and cell death by the compounds l-carnitine and piracetam.",

Statin users were younger than nonusers (72.4 vs 73.4 years) but had a higher prevalence of ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and chronic renal disease. Overall, statin therapy reduced the risk of atrial fibrillation by 19% (adjusted hazard ratio 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.95; P=.009). Subgroup analysis showed that statin use was beneficial in patients with or without a particular comorbidity. The effectiveness of statins was significant in patients with CHADS(2) score \u22652 (adjusted hazard ratio 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.85; P <.001).

    "59": "The duration of the cholesterol-lowering effect of statins is considerably longer than the duration of the pharmacokinetic half-life of these drugs. The long duration of pharmacologic effects provides the rational for the efficacy of intermittent dosing that provides nearly the equivalent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction compared with daily dosing. Review of studies comparing alternate-day dosing with daily dosing of statins indicates that the magnitude of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction with alternate-day dosing is nearly the same, with obvious cost savings. It is possible that the adverse effects of statins, such as myalgia or diabetes, may be related to the cumulative amount of drug ingested over time, and if so, the adverse effects may be decreased by alternate-day dosing.", 
    "60": "Membrane transporters have been recognized to play a key role in determining the absorption, distribution and elimination processes of drugs. The organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and OATP1B3 isoforms are selectively expressed in the human liver and are known to cause significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs), as observed with an increasing number of drugs. It is evident that DDIs involving hepatic transporters are capable of altering systemic, as well as tissue-specific, exposure of drug substrates resulting in marked differences in drug safety and/or efficacy. It is therefore essential to quantitatively predict such interactions early in the drug development to mitigate clinical risks.", 
    "61": "The role of hepatic uptake transporters in drug disposition and clinical DDIs has been reviewed with an emphasis on the current state of the models applicable for quantitative predictions. The readers will also gain insight into the in vitro experimental tools available to characterize transport kinetics, while appreciating the knowledge gaps in the in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), which warrant further investigation.", 
    "62": "Static and dynamic models can be convincingly applied to quantitatively predict drug interactions, early in drug discovery, to mitigate clinical risks as well as to avoid unnecessary clinical studies. Compared to basic models, which focus on individual processes, mechanistic models provide the ability to assess DDI potential for compounds with systemic disposition determined by both transporters and metabolic enzymes. However, complexities in the experimental tools and an apparent disconnect in the IVIVE of transport kinetics have limited the physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling strategies. Emerging data on the expression of transporter proteins and tissue drug concentrations are expected to help bridge these gaps. In addition, detailed characterization of substrate kinetics can facilitate building comprehensive mechanistic models.",

Several studies that explored the association between lipids and/or lipid-lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E (APOE), apolipoprotein J (APOJ, CLU), ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 7(ABCA7), and sortilin-related receptor (SORL1). Functional cell biology studies further support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of A\u03b2 precursor protein processing by \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase resulting in altered A\u03b2 production. However, conflicting evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk, randomized clinical trials observing no beneficial effect of statin therapy, and cell biology studies suggesting that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol level is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits colocalization of \u03b2-secretase 1 and A\u03b2 precursor protein in nonraft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an A\u03b2-degrading enzyme.

However, these associations have not been well documented in high risk surgical patients. We hypothesized that serum 25OHD, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25OHD) would be associated with the cardiac operative risk stratification score. The study was conducted with a cross-sectional design at a single academic medical center in Japan. Two hundred five adult patients scheduled for major cardiovascular surgery were included consecutively. Cardiac operative risk was evaluated with the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) scoring system. Correlations between 25OHD and 1,25OHD, and EuroSCORE were assessed using simple and multiple linear regression models. Mean 25OHD and 1,25OHD were 20.1 \u00b1 7.1 ng/mL and 51.2 \u00b1 19.2 pg/mL, respectively. Half and 88% of the study population showed deficient (<20 ng/mL) and insufficient (<30 ng/mL) 25OHD levels, respectively. In contrast, only 3% showed 1,25OHD levels lower than normal (<20 pg/mL). Circulating 25OHD levels, but not 1,25OHD levels, were negatively correlated with EuroSCORE (p=0.005) even after adjusted for body mass index, albumin, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, creatinine, use of statin, high sensitive C-reactive protein, and intact parathyroid hormone. These results suggest that serum 25OHD levels are inversely associated with operative risk severity of patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgery.",

Surprisingly, aggressive management of glucose after an acute stroke has not been shown to improve outcome or reduce the incidence of further strokes. More encouragingly, active management of other cardiovascular risk factors has been demonstrated to prevent stroke disease and improve outcome following a stroke in the diabetic person. Hypertension should be treated with a target of 140/80\u2009mmHg, as a maximum. The drug of choice would be an ACE inhibitor, although the priority is blood pressure reduction regardless of the medication chosen. Lipids should be treated with a statin whatever the starting cholesterol. Antiplatelet treatment is also essential but there are no specific recommendations for the diabetic person.

Both atorvastatin and vitamin E showed a statistically significant GPO increase (P<0.05) and a statistically significant IL-6 decrease (P<0.05). Only atorvastatin showed a statistically significant increase in NO (15.19%, P<0.05), eNOS (20.58%, P<0.01), IIEF-5 score (53.1%, P<0.001) and Rigiscan rigidity parameters (P<0.01), in addition to a statistically significant decrease in CRP (57.9%, P<0.01). However, SOD showed a statistically significant increase only after vitamin E intake (23.1%, P<0.05). Both atorvatstain and vitamin E had antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Although activating eNOS by atorvastatin was the real difference, and expected to be the main mechanism for NO increase and for improving erectile dysfunction.

Using multiple logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) for each of the three outcomes were at a maximum for the 0.9-1.0 MPR category with ORs of 12.90 (95% confidence interval (CI), 9.60, 17.35) for the non-HDL cholesterol outcome; 11.29 (95% CI, 8.61, 14.80) for the LDL cholesterol outcome; and 9.11 (95% CI, 6.62, 12.53) for the TC outcome. Direct comparison of the 0.9-1.0 MPR category versus the 0.8-0.89 MPR category demonstrated an increase in odds of achieving 25% or more reduction for all three lipid outcomes.",

    "113": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is prevalent in people with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes and is present in up to one-third of the general population. Evidence is now accumulating that NAFLD is associated with obesity and diabetes and may serve as a predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The possible mechanisms linking NAFLD and CVD include inflammation and oxidative stress, hyperlipidaemia, insulin resistance, and direct impact of NAFLD on coronary arteries and left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, several studies suggest that NAFLD is associated with high risk of CVD and atherosclerosis such as carotid artery wall thickness and lower endothelial flow-mediated vasodilation independently of classical risk factors and components of the metabolic syndrome. It is not yet clear how treatment of NAFLD will modulate the risk of CVD. Furthermore, studies are urgently needed to establish (i) the pathophysiology of CVD with NAFLD and (ii) the benefit of early diagnosis and treatment of CVD in patients with NAFLD. In the absence of biochemical markers, it is crucial that screening and surveillance strategies are adopted in clinical practice in the growing number of patients with NAFLD and at risk of developing CVD. Importantly, the current evidence suggest that statins are safe and effective treatment for CVD in individuals with NAFLD.", 
    "114": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), a multiple congenital anomaly with severe mental retardation, is caused by decreased activity of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. Fifteen Hungarian patients were diagnosed with SLOS on the basis of clinical symptoms, serum cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol, and molecular genetic testing. Their age at the time of diagnosis in mild SLOS (n = 4, clinical score <20) was 0.5-18 years, cholesterol was 2.37 \u00b1 0.8 mmol/L, and 7DHC was 0.38 \u00b1 0.14 mmol/L. In the group of typical SLOS (n = 7, score 20-50), the diagnosis was set up earlier (age of 0.1-7 years); t-cholesterol was 1.47 \u00b1 0.7 mmol/L, and 7DHC was 0.53 \u00b1 0.20 mmol/L. Patients with severe SLOS (n = 4, clinical score > 50) died as newborns and had the lowest t-cholesterol (0.66 \u00b1 0.27 mmol/L), and 7DHC was 0.47 \u00b1 0.14 mmol/L. Correlation coefficient with clinical severity was 0.74 for initial t-cholesterol and 0.669 for Cho/7DHC. Statistically significant difference was between the initial t-cholesterol of mild and severe SLOS (p = 0.01), and between the Cho/7DHC ratios of groups (p = 0.004). In severe SLOS, the percentage of \u03b1-lipoprotein was significantly lower than in typical (p = 0.003) and mild SLOS (p = 0.004). Although serum albumin, total bilirubin, and hemostasis parameters remained in the reference range during cholesterol supplementation (n = 10) combined with statin therapy (n = 9), increase of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in 50 % of the patients probably refers to a reversible alteration of liver function; therefore, statin therapy was suspended.", 
    "115": "life expectancy is fundamentally determined by the initial t-cholesterol, but dehydrocholesterol and \u03b1-lipoprotein have prognostic value. Accumulation of hepatotoxic DHC may inhibit the synthesis of \u03b1-lipoproteins, decreasing the reverse cholesterol transport. During statin therapy, we suggest monitoring of lipid parameters and liver function.", 
    "116": "The discovery of PCSK9 in 2003 and its identification as the third protagonist responsible for ADH opened many new avenues of research in the cardiovascular field. Liver PCSK9 binds the LDLR and promotes its degradation in the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. A higher activity of PCSK9 leads to lower liver LDLR levels, resulting in a reduction in LDL-uptake from circulation, and thus in hypercholesterolemia and associated atherosclerosis. Although PCSK9 mutations are rare, their associated phenotypes can be devastating. The most powerful PCSK9 gain-of-function mutation, D374Y, is responsible for LDL cholesterol (LDLc) levels of ~10 mmol/L versus ~3 mmol/L in normal subjects.The aim of this manuscript is to review the available literature on the identification and pharmacological applications of potent inhibitors of PCSK9 function and/or activity, and to present the latest data on the ongoing clinical trials, mostly related to the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that interfere with PCSK9 function on the LDLR, resulting in a significant drop in circulating LDLc.The clinical data, so far, are very encouraging with Phase-2 trials from various pharmaceutical companies showing a drop of >60% in LDLc for at least 2 weeks after a single injection of a humanized PCSK9 mAb in the presence or absence of adjunct statin therapy. In view of the absence of overt toxicity associated with this treatment Phase-3 clinical trials have started with >20,000 individuals being tested and anticipated primary outcomes results should be forthcoming by 2016. Other approaches including the use of recombinant adnectins, antisense RNAi or small molecule inhibitors are also undergoing early pre-clinical testing or are already in Phase-1 clinical trials.Very recent data revealed that absence of PCSK9 can be protective against melanoma invasion in mouse liver, and that this is due to lower circulating LDLc. This opens the door to novel applications of PCSK9 inhibitors/silencers in cancer/metastasis.", 
    "117": "Treatment with statins represents an essential component both of primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention strategies. However, a proportion of patients cannot reach low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets with the highest tolerable dose of a potent statin or is intolerant to statins. Several treatment options are available for these patients. Colesevelam is a relatively new bile acid sequestrant that decreases serum LDL-C levels. Moreover, colesevelam improves glycemic control and seems to be well-tolerated, at least in short-term studies. Therefore, colesevelam seems to be a useful tool for the management of high-risk patients who cannot achieve LDL-C targets with monotherapy with a potent statin.", 
    "118": "The clinically most relevant medications for lipid management are the statins, which constitute in the majority of the cases the basis of any lipid-modulating therapy. However, other agents are often needed to either reduce low-density cholesterol to target levels and/or to treat residual serum lipoprotein abnormalities. Niacin is currently the most potent available agent to increase high-density lipoprotein and reduce lipoprotein(a), both independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Niacin also has been found to reduce inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase-A2 (Lp-PLA2) and to decrease small-dense LDL and increase large-particle LDL, all potentially anti-atherosclerotic properties. Through its action on the GPR109A receptor niacin seems to also exert various pleiotropic effects such as improvement of endothelial function and reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress. However, niacin is often underused in the clinical setting, mainly due to either potentially preventable or disproportionally feared side effects such as flushing, hyperglycemia, and hyperuricemia, respectively. Even though the results of the AIM-HIGH trial were negative, the results of the larger end point trial HPS2-THRIVE are still pending. Based on the totality of existing evidence, niacin should in the mean time remain high in the list of lipid-modulating agents to be used in clinical practice, second after statins.", 
    "119": "Ezetimibe, an inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption, can decrease total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TGs) and apolipoprotein (apo) B levels and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Apart from lipid-lowering, ezetimibe may exert certain off-target actions (e.g. anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic and antioxidant) thus contributing to a further decrease of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.Ezetimibe trials resulted in controversial outcomes with some studies reporting atherosclerosis regression and reductions in CVD events following ezetimibe therapy in combination with a statin while others reported negative results. The results of the ongoing IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) which compares ezetimibe plus simvastatin with simvastatin monotherapy with regard to CVD outcomes after acute coronary syndromes should further elucidate the effect of ezetimibe on CVD events.This review presents the results of up-to-date clinical trials with ezetimibe and summarizes its potential pleiotropic effects. Furthermore, we comment on the administration of ezetimibe in treating high-risk patients [i.e. with diabetes mellitus (DM), metabolic syndrome (MetS), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), peripheral artery disease (PAD) or carotid disease]. The use of ezetimibe either as monotherapy or as add-on therapy in daily clinical practice is also discussed.",

In anticipation of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel IV guidelines, we wanted to assess the current state of lipid goal attainment in the high-risk secondary prevention population in the United States. The objectives of the study were to estimate the proportion of high-risk patients treated with statin monotherapy who achieved Adult Treatment Panel III-recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals (<100 mg/dL; optional <70 mg/dL) as well as non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals (<130 mg/dL; optional <100 mg/dL).",

High-risk patients (\u2265 18 years of age) were defined as those with a history of coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease risk equivalent who had the latest complete lipid panel measurement and had been treated with statin monotherapy for >90 days at the time of the lipid panel. Cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and coronary heart disease risk equivalents were defined on the basis of availability, specific to each data source. Across the 3 data sources, 20% to 26% of high-risk patients treated with statin monotherapy for >90 days had LDL-C <70 mg/dL, and 67% to 77% had LDL-C <100 mg/dL. The percentages of those attaining both LDL-C goals and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals were quantitatively smaller (13.5% to 19.0% and 46% to 70%).",

We used the JCR:LA-cp rat model of metabolic syndrome (MetS) to determine the extent of arterial accumulation of intestinal-derived remnants ex vivo and potential mechanisms that contribute to exacerbated cholesterol deposition in insulin resistance.", 
    "124": "Arteries from control and MetS (insulin-resistant) JCR:LA-cp rats were perfused ex vivo with Cy5-labeled remnant lipoproteins, and their arterial retention was quantified by confocal microscopy. Arterial proteoglycans were isolated from control and MetS rats at 6, 12, and 32 weeks of age. There was a significant increase in the arterial retention of remnants and in associated cholesterol accumulation in MetS rats as compared to control rats. Mechanistic studies reveal that increased cholesterol deposition is a result of greater arterial biglycan content; longer glycosaminoglycans and increased production of cholesterol-rich intestinal-derived remnants, as compared to controls. Additionally, perfusion of vessels treated with ezetimibe, alone or in combination with simvastatin, with remnants isolated from the respective treatment group reduced ex vivo arterial retention of remnant-derived cholesterol ex vivo as compared to untreated controls.", 
    "125": "Increased progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in MetS and type 2 diabetes mellitus might be explained in part by an increase in the arterial retention of cholesterol-rich remnants. Furthermore, ezetimibe alone or in combination treatment with simvastatin could be beneficial in ameliorating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in insulin resistance and MetS.",

Biological modulation of clopidogrel response has been demonstrated for atorvastatin and omeprazole. However, investigations assessing clinical relevance of these findings have been heterogeneous, and real clinical impact is still debatable. For new P2Y12 blockers, such as prasugrel, with less variability of platelet inhibition, these interactions are not significant; accordingly, no dose adjustment is required. The present review aims to summarize available scientific evidence about CYP-mediated pharmacologic interference with optimal platelet inhibition in patients treated with thienopyridine.",

Of these, no patient (0%) met evidentiary requirements for diagnosis of myopathy or related complications. No patient (0%) developed muscle pain or discomfort and none developed markedly elevated CK levels. The incidence of asymptomatic elevations of CK in these simvastatin or rosuvastatin plus daptomycin recipients (9%) was statistically indistinguishable from the incidence of CK elevations found in a cohort of 105 inpatients who received simvastatin or rosuvastatin alone (21%; p=0.135).", 
    "135": "In patients receiving treatment with simvastatin or rosuvastatin and daptomycin, no symptoms or objective evidence of muscle injury attributable to a drug interaction were identified. These findings are consistent with data indicating that the myopathic effects of statins and daptomycin are incited by disparate and perhaps unique pharmacological mechanisms. Risk of muscle injury therefore appears to be no greater when a statin is administered with daptomycin than when either medication is used alone.",

Metabolism of certain statins involves the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) enzymes, and CYP3A4*22 significantly influences the dose needed for achieving optimal lipid control for atorvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin.

Of the 10,743 beneficiaries with known nonexudative AMD eligible for the progression model, 404 progressed to exudative AMD during their time in the plan. After multivariable analysis, statin use was not associated with the development of nonexudative AMD (P > 0.05). Statin use of >12 months was associated with an increased hazard for developing exudative AMD (P < 0.005).

    "144": "Statins are widely used to treat hyperlipidemia and lower cardiovascular disease risk. While statins are generally well tolerated, some patients experience statin-induced myopathy (SIM). Statin treatment has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion. In this retrospective study, skeletal muscle biopsies from patients diagnosed with SIM were studied. These were compared with biopsies from patients clinically assessed as having statin-unrelated myopathy but whose biopsy showed no or negligible pathology. For each biopsy sample, mtDNA was quantified relative to nuclear DNA (mtDNA content) by qPCR, mtDNA deletions were investigated by long-template PCR followed by gel densitometry, and mtDNA oxidative damage was quantified using a qPCR-based assay. For a subset of matched samples, mtDNA heteroplasmy and mutations were investigated by cloning/sequencing. Skeletal muscle mtDNA content was significantly lower in SIM patients (N=23, mean\u00b1SD, 2036\u00b11146) than in comparators (N=24, 3220\u00b11594), p=0.006. There was no difference in mtDNA deletion score or oxidative mtDNA damage between the two groups, and no evidence of increased mtDNA heteroplasmy or somatic mutations was detected. The significant difference in skeletal muscle mtDNA suggests that SIM or statin treatments are associated with depletion of skeletal muscle mtDNA or that patients with an underlying predisposition to SIM have lower mtDNA levels. If statins induce mtDNA depletion, this would likely reflect decreased mitochondria biogenesis and/or increased mitochondria autophagy. Further work is necessary to distinguish between the lower mtDNA as a predisposition to SIM or an effect of SIM or statin treatment.",

The aim of this observational retrospective cohort study, conducted at our single center, was to determine the risk factors for peritonitis. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for the multivariate analysis. The event investigated was peritonitis, and the variables studied were sex, age, diabetes mellitus, use of statins, and several laboratory values including albumin and total cholesterol. All PD patients who visited our clinic from January 2005 to September 2011 and who had complete medical records for at least 3 years were included. Among the 82 patients who met the criteria (mean period of observation: 1086 +/- 752 days; mean age: 62.0 +/- 12.3 years), 47 had experienced at least 1 episode of peritonitis. Aging was a significant risk factor for peritonitis, with a relative risk of 1.04 per year (p = 0.014). In our study, aging--rather than diabetes mellitus, efficiency of PD, or nutrition status--was an important risk factor for PD-associated peritonitis. Poor PD technique because of advanced age might be one of the reasons for this result.",

Statin therapy has been proven in a number of clinical trials to lower the risk of acute cardiovascular events and is the mainstay of cholesterol treatment. Despite current optimal treatment for dyslipidemia, many patients fail to reach adequate cholesterol treatment goals and remain at a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events. Given this residual risk, there is a critical need for additional lipid therapies that could augment the ability of statins to lower the burden of atherogenic lipoproteins and, in some cases, raise levels of high-density lipoproteins. A number of novel lipid-altering therapies have been developed and are currently in clinical trials. In this review, we discuss these promising therapies, which include PCSK9 inhibitors, apolipoprotein B antisense oligonucleotides, microsomal transfer protein inhibitors, thyroid mimetics, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors. Although statin therapy is the current recommended primary treatment for dyslipidemia, emerging novel agents may become adjuvant therapies in the treatment of atherosclerotic heart disease.",

The adverse effects of statins on muscles and the influence thereof on athletic performance remain uncertain. Coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ10) may improve performance and reduce muscle toxicity in older athletes taking statins. This trial was designed to evaluate the benefits of CoQ10 administration for mitochondrial function in this population. Twenty athletes aged \u2265 50 years who were taking stable doses of statins were randomized to receive either CoQ10 (200 mg daily) or placebo for 6 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study to evaluate the impact of CoQ10 on the anaerobic threshold (AT). Several secondary endpoints, including muscle function, cardiopulmonary exercise function, and subjective feelings of fitness, were also assessed. The mean (SD) change in AT from baseline was -0.59 (1.2) mL/kg/min during placebo treatment and 2.34 (0.8) mL/kg/min during CoQ10 treatment (P = 0.116). The mean change in time to AT from baseline was significantly greater during CoQ10 treatment than during placebo treatment (40.26 s vs 0.58 s, P = 0.038). Furthermore, muscle strength as measured by leg extension repetitions (reps) increased significantly during CoQ10 treatment, with a mean (SD) increase from baseline of 1.73 (2.9) reps during placebo treatment versus 3.78 (5.0) reps during CoQ10 treatment (P = 0.031).

    "177": "Insulin-induced gene proteins (INSIGs) function in control of cellular cholesterol. Mammalian INSIGs exert control by directly interacting with proteins containing sterol-sensing domains (SSDs) when sterol levels are elevated. Mammalian 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (HMGR) undergoes sterol-dependent, endoplasmic-reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) that is mediated by INSIG interaction with the HMGR SSD. The yeast HMGR isozyme Hmg2 also undergoes feedback-regulated ERAD in response to the early pathway-derived isoprene gernanylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Hmg2 has an SSD, and its degradation is controlled by the INSIG homologue Nsg1. However, yeast Nsg1 promotes Hmg2 stabilization by inhibiting GGPP-stimulated ERAD. We have proposed that the seemingly disparate INSIG functions can be unified by viewing INSIGs as sterol-dependent chaperones of SSD clients. Accordingly, we tested the role of sterols in the Nsg1 regulation of Hmg2. We found that both Nsg1-mediated stabilization of Hmg2 and the Nsg1-Hmg2 interaction required the early sterol lanosterol. Lowering lanosterol in the cell allowed GGPP-stimulated Hmg2 ERAD. Thus, Hmg2-regulated degradation is controlled by a two-signal logic; GGPP promotes degradation, and lanosterol inhibits degradation. These data reveal that the sterol dependence of INSIG-client interaction has been preserved for over 1 billion years. We propose that the INSIGs are a class of sterol-dependent chaperones that bind to SSD clients, thus harnessing ER quality control in the homeostasis of sterols.",

Sixty-four South-Asian Canadians with coronary artery disease or diabetes and persistent hypercholesterolemia on statin therapy, were randomized to ezetimibe 10\u2009mg/day co-administered with statin therapy (EZE + Statin) or doubling their current statin dose (STAT(2)). Primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving target LDL-C (<2.0\u2009mmol/L) after 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the change in lipid profile and the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events through 12 weeks. Exploratory markers for vascular inflammation were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. Results. At 6 weeks, the primary outcome was significantly higher among the EZE + Statin patients (68% versus 36%; P = 0.031) with an OR (95% CI) of 3.97 (1.19, 13.18) upon accounting for baseline LDL-C and adjusting for age.

No significant between-group differences in exploratory markers were observed with the exception of CRP. Conclusions. Patients receiving ezetimibe and statin were more likely to achieve target LDL-C after 6 and 12 weeks compared to patients doubling their statin dose. Ezetimibe/statin combination therapy was well tolerated among this cohort of South-Asian Canadians, without safety concerns.",

However, the detailed mechanism of the increase in ileal P-gp via RhoA activation remains unknown. Recently, it has been reported that ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins, linking several plasma-membrane proteins to the actin cytoskeleton, are involved in the membrane localization and functional activity of P-gp. Moreover, the cross-linking activities of ERM are known to be regulated by RhoA and Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase (ROCK). Here, we examined the involvement of ERM in the changes in expression of P-gp via RhoA and ROCK in ileal membrane induced by ETP. Repeated oral treatment with ETP significantly increased the ileal membrane localization of ERM and phosphorylated ERM (p-ERM) in association with upregulation of P-gp and activation of RhoA and ROCK. Interestingly, coadministration of rosuvastatin (inhibitor of RhoA activation) and fasudil (ROCK inhibitor) prevented increments in the activation and phosphorylation of ERM, respectively. In conclusion, upregulation of ileal membrane localization of ERM and p-ERM via activation of RhoA/ROCK induced by ETP treatment may be involved in the regulation of ileal membrane localization of P-gp.",

All parameters were measured in Weeks 0, 12, and 24. Treatments were switched in Week 0, and Week 12 and the following results were obtained. There were 1) no significant differences in baseline characteristics; 2) no significant difference of the blood pressure reduction rate; 3) significant reductions of HbA1c (NGSP), FPG and HOMA-IR in olmesartan group; 4) a significant increase of HDL-C in olmesartan group; 5) a decrease of hs-CRP and a increase of HMW-adiponectin in olmesartan group; and 6) a positive correlation between the percent changes of HOMA-IR and hs-CRP in olmesartan group. In conclusion, there was no difference of the blood pressure reduction achieved at the highest dose in olmesartan group and telmisartan group. But improvement of glycemic control and insulin resistance was only observed in olmesartan group. Because there was a correlation between the percent changes of HOMA-IR and hs-CRP, these effects of olmesartan might be mediated by an anti-inflammatory action.",

Previous work has documented a persistent cognitive impairment in children who survive an episode of CM that is mimicked in animal models of the disease. Potential therapeutic interventions for this complication have not been investigated, and are urgently needed. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely prescribed for cardiovascular diseases. In addition to their effects on the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, statins have pleiotropic immunomodulatory activities. Here we tested if statins would prevent cognitive impairment in a murine model of cerebral malaria. Six days after infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) mice displayed clear signs of CM and were treated with chloroquine, or chloroquine and lovastatin. Intravital examination of pial vessels of infected animals demonstrated a decrease in functional capillary density and an increase in rolling and adhesion of leukocytes to inflamed endothelium that were reversed by treatment with lovastatin. In addition, oedema, ICAM-1, and CD11b mRNA levels were reduced in lovastatin-treated PbA-infected mice brains. Moreover, HMOX-1 mRNA levels are enhanced in lovastatin-treated healthy and infected brains. Oxidative stress and key inflammatory chemokines and cytokines were reduced to non-infected control levels in animals treated with lovastatin. Fifteen days post-infection cognitive dysfunction was detected by a battery of cognition tests in animals rescued from CM by chloroquine treatment. In contrast, it was absent in animals treated with lovastatin and chloroquine. The outcome was similar in experimental bacterial sepsis, suggesting that statins have neuroprotective effects in severe infectious syndromes in addition to CM. Statin treatment prevents neuroinflammation and blood brain barrier dysfunction in experimental CM and related conditions that are associated with cognitive sequelae, and may be a valuable adjuvant therapeutic agent for prevention of cognitive impairment in patients surviving an episode of CM.",

Gains in total and CVD-free life expectancy increased with blood pressure, unfavorable lipid levels, and body mass index after multivariable adjustment. Gains decreased considerably with advancing age, while SCORE 10-y CVD mortality risk increased with age. Twenty-five percent of participants with a low SCORE risk achieved equal or larger gains in CVD-free life expectancy than the median gain in participants with a high SCORE risk.", 
    "211": "We developed tools to predict personalized increases in total and CVD-free life expectancy with statin therapy. The predicted gains we found are small. If the underlying model is validated in an independent cohort, the tools may be useful in discussing with patients their individual outcomes with statin therapy.", 
    "212": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin-like/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protein involved in LDL-cholesterol metabolism. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11591147 has been associated with lower LDL-cholesterol and a lower risk of coronary heart disease. Because PCSK9 has high affinity to the LDL receptor, inhibiting PCSK9 is a testable therapeutic target for lipid-lowering therapy. Currently, several approaches to inhibit PCSK9 are under development, but it is unknown what the effects of those inhibitors will be on cognition or noncardiovascular clinical events. In this study, we assessed the association between rs11591147 and cognitive performance, activities of daily living (ADL), and noncardiovascular clinical events within 5,777 participants of the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). Rs11591147 was associated with 10% to 16% lower LDL cholesterol levels (P = 3.62 \u00d7 10(-12)), but was not associated with cognitive performance, ADL, or noncardiovascular clinical events in the PROSPER study. Our findings suggest that lower cholesterol levels due to genetic variation in the PCSK9 gene are not associated with cognitive performance, functional status, or noncardiovascular clinical events.", 
    "213": "Case reports have suggested that the use of statins may be associated with an increase in the risk of interstitial lung disease (ILD).", 
    "214": "Within a large cohort of users of respiratory medications identified in the Quebec health administrative databases during 1990-2005, we carried out a nested case-control analysis of the relationship between statins and the risk of ILD as defined by specialist visits or hospitalisations.", 
    "215": "The cohort included over 1.4 million patients, of which 6665 possible or probable cases of ILD were identified during follow-up. These were compared with 26 660 controls matched for age, gender and calendar time. After adjustment for confounders and comorbid conditions, there was no association between current use of statins and risk of ILD (adjusted OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.08). The results were similar when any use of statins within the previous 1 or 2 years was considered or when the analysis was limited to more definite cases.", 
    "216": "This large cohort study did not find an association between statin use and the incidence of ILD.", 
    "217": "Characterization of local inflammation at culprit superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenosis has not been studied. We hypothesized that arterial cytokine concentrations would be greater at sites of stenosis. Twenty patients with \u226550\u00a0% angiographic stenosis of the SFA had blood drawn just proximal to the lesion and from a contralateral site free of disease. A microplate immunoassay was used to determine the concentrations of 42 distinct cytokines and growth factors. Exact conditional logistic analysis was used to compare measures at the two sites with interaction terms describing clinical factors used to identify difference mediators. Interaction terms identified clinical factors that could predict cytokine levels. The concentrations of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L; mean 212 and 177\u00a0pg/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF-B; mean 16.6 and 15.9\u00a0pg/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) were increased immediately proximal to areas of stenosis. Factors associated with greater concentrations at sites of stenosis were bilateral ankle-brachial index \u22640.90 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), no statin use (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), claudication (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), low leukocyte count (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), absence of limb ischemia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and lack of aspirin or clopidogrel therapy (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.06). Greater concentrations of sCD40L and TNF-B at sites of stenosis suggest that these cytokines play a role in the pathogenesis of symptomatic SFA disease. Our results also suggest that statin, aspirin and clopidogrel therapy may attenuate localized inflammation in the SFA, though due to a small sample size and the use of multiple comparisons across groups, these findings can be viewed as hypothesis generating only. In conclusion, selected cytokines are heightened at culprit SFA lesions and inflammation may be modulated by statin and antiplatelet therapy.", 
    "218": "Despite the best available medical therapy inclusive of statins, substantial residual risk remains for atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease. Non-statin lipid-lowering therapy may help address this critical unmet need through reduction of the levels of low-density lipoprotein and other atherogenic lipoproteins. In the past few years, several landmark trials have provided important information regarding the efficacy and safety of non-statin therapy for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction.", 
    "219": "Statins are widely used for their cholesterol-lowering properties and proven reduction of cardiovascular disease risk. Many patients take statins as long-term treatment for a variety of conditions without a clear-cut understanding of how treatment duration affects the frequency of adverse effects. We aimed to evaluate whether the frequencies of documented adverse events increase, decrease, or remain unchanged with long-term statin use. We reviewed the established literature to define the currently known adverse effects of statin therapy, including myopathy, central nervous system effects, and the appearance of diabetes, and the frequency of these events with long-term medication use. The frequency of adverse effects associated with long-term statin therapy appears to be low. Many patients who develop side effects from statin therapy do so relatively soon after initiation of therapy, so the frequency of side effects from statin therapy when expressed as a percentage of current users decreases over time. Nevertheless, patients may develop side effects such as muscle pain and weakness years after starting statin therapy; however, the absolute number of patients affected by statin myopathy increases with treatment duration. Also, clinical trials of statin therapy rarely exceed 5\u00a0years, so it is impossible to determine with certainty the frequency of long-term side effects with these drugs."
