    "1": "We conducted a review of the literature using electronic databases supplemented by a manual search to identify potentially relevant case-control or cohort studies. Summary relative risk (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also conducted.", 
    "2": "Eleven studies (five case-control and six cohort) with a total of 3,513,209 participants and 21,011 PD cases were included. Statin use was associated with a lower risk of PD, with a summary RR of 0.81 (95% CI 0.71-0.92). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of results. Subgroup analyses showed that neither study design nor study region significantly influenced the effect estimates. However, subgroup studies adjusted for age or sex had a greater inverse association than did unadjusted analyses (age-adjusted RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60-0.95; age-unadjusted RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75-0.99 and sex-adjusted RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.98; sex-unadjusted RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79-0.92).",

    "4": "Atherothrombosis is a recurrent complication in APS and SLE patients. Oxidative stress has been suggested as a key player underlying this process. Autoantibodies have been pointed to as the main contributors to abnormality in the oxidative status observed in APS and SLE patients, promoting the increased production of oxidant species and the reduction of antioxidant molecules. This imbalance causes vascular damage through the activation of immune cells, including monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils, causing the expression of pro-inflammatory and procoagulant molecules, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and the adhesion of these cells to the endothelium; the induction of cellular apoptosis and impaired cell clearance, which in turn enhances autoantibody neogeneration; and cytotoxicity of endothelial cells. This review describes the mechanisms underlying the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of atherothrombosis associated with APS and SLE, focused on the effect of autoantibodies, the different cell types involved and the diverse effectors, including cytokines, procoagulant proteins and their main modulators, such as oxidant/antioxidant species and intracellular pathways in each pathology. We further discuss new therapies aimed at restoring the oxidative stress balance and subsequently to tackle atherothrombosis in APS and SLE.",

After the double-blind period, all patients were offered open-label statin therapy. Data were obtained over a further 10 years from 7721 patients, by direct contact for 2 years, by questionnaires thereafter, and from mortality and cancer registries. During extended follow-up, 85% assigned pravastatin and 84% assigned placebo took statin therapy. Patients assigned pravastatin maintained a significantly lower risk of death from coronary heart disease (relative risk [RR] 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.97; P=0.009), from cardiovascular disease (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.81-0.95; P=0.002), and from any cause (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.97; absolute risk reduction, 2.6%; P=0.003).Cancer incidence was similar by original treatment group during the double-blind period (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.82-1.08; P=0.41), later follow-up (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.91-1.14; P=0.74), and overall (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91-1.08; P=0.83).

Herein, we report that the administration of SV (20\u00a0mg/kg) for 5 days in mice (SV-mice) or the treatment of slices with SV (10\u00a0\u03bcM) for 4\u00a0h (SV-slices) could increase the density of NMDA-evoked inward currents (INMDA) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, which were blocked by farnesol (FOH) that converts farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), but not geranylgeraniol (GGOH) that increases geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP). Sensitivity of INMDA to ifenprodil in SV-mice or SV-slices was significantly increased. The levels of hippocampal GluN2B and GluN2A or Src phosphorylation in SV-mice or SV-slices were higher than controls, which were sensitive to FOH. The Src inhibitor PP2 could inhibit the SV-enhanced phosphorylation of GluN2B and GluN2A and SV-augmented INMDA, but PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not. The levels of GluN2B mRNA and protein were elevated in SV-mice, which was abolished by FOH, but not by GGOH or PP2. Furthermore, the histone H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation of GluN2B promoter was increased in SV-mice, which was suppressed by FOH rather than GGOH or PP2. In control mice and slices, the reduction of FPP by farnesyl transferase inhibitor could increase the levels of GluN2B expression, the histone H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation and enhance the phosphorylation of GluN2B, GluN2A and Src. The findings indicate that the administration of SV can enhance GluN2B expression and GluN2B and GluN2A phosphorylation leading to augmentation of NMDAR activity through reducing FPP to increase histone acetylation of GluN2B and Src signaling.",

    "17": "Lymphedema is a debilitating progressive condition that severely restricts quality of life and is frequently observed after cancer surgery. The mechanism underlying lymphedema development remains poorly understood, and no effective pharmacological means to prevent or alleviate the ailment is currently available. Using a mouse model of lymphedema, we show here that excessive generation of immature lymphatic vessels is essential for initial edema development and that this early process is also important for later development of lymphedema pathology. We found that CD4(+) T cells interact with macrophages to promote lymphangiogenesis, and that both lymphangiogenesis and edema were greatly reduced in macrophage-depleted mice, lymphocyte-deficient Rag2(?/?) mice or CD4(+) T-cell-deficient mice. Mechanistically, T helper type 1 and T helper type 17 cells activate lesional macrophages to produce vascular endothelial growth factor-C, which promotes lymphangiogenesis, and inhibition of this mechanism suppressed not only early lymphangiogenesis, but also later development of lymphedema. Finally, we show that atorvastatin suppresses excessive lymphangiogenesis and lymphedema by inhibiting T helper type 1 and T helper type 17 cell activation. These results demonstrate that the interaction between CD4(+) T cells and macrophages is a potential therapeutic target for prevention of lymphedema after surgery.",

In the meta-regression analysis, the impact of statins on PAI-1 did not correlate with the administered dose, duration of treatment and changes in plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Finally, evidence of publication bias was observed. In conclusion, taking into account the limit of heterogeneity between studies, the present meta-analysis suggests that statin therapy (mainly atorvastatin) significantly lowers plasma PAI-1 concentrations.",

The use of statins is the most important preventative measure of ischemic heart disease; however, their efficacy in patients in Poland is still too low. The purpose of this study was to evaluate regional differences in achieving treatment goals in total cholesterol (TC) and LDL cholesterol levels in patients treated with statins on an outpatient basis.", 
    "56": "A survey was used to evaluate efficacy of treatment, completed by 49,950 patients in Poland treated with statins in 2008. The territory of Poland was divided into 4 research regions: the Northeast (NE), Northwest (NW), Southeast (SE), and Southwest (SW) regions.", 
    "57": "The largest group of patients resided in the SW region, the smallest in the SE region. Participants of the study suffered from hypercholesterolemia, on average, for at least a year before completing the study survey. Effective treatment leading to achievement of target TC was observed in less than 10% of the patients. Rate of achievement of target cholesterol levels was highest in the NE region, lowest in the NW region. Cardiologists were more successful in achieving therapeutic goals than GPs. Similar correlations between regions and doctors' specializations were observed for LDL values.", 
    "58": "Significant differences in the efficacy of treatment with statins were observed among the study group and were evaluated based on achievement of target TC and LDL cholesterol levels. Better results achieved in the NE region may be because the region includes the Masovian province, which is the most economically developed region in Poland.", 
    "59": "Statin therapy has a very important role in decreasing cardiovascular risk, and treatment non-compliance may therefore be a concern in high cardiovascular risk patients. Myotoxicity is a frequent side effect of statin therapy and one of the main causes of statin discontinuation, which limits effective treatment of patients at risk of or with cardiovascular disease. Because of the high proportion of patients on statin treatment and the frequency of statin-related myotoxicity, this is a subject of concern in clinical practice. However, statin-related myotoxicity is probably underestimated because there is not a gold standard definition, and its diagnosis is challenging. Moreover, information about pathophysiology and optimal therapeutic options is scarce. Therefore, this paper reviews the knowledge about the definition, pathophysiology and predisposing conditions, diagnosis and management of statin-related myotoxicity, and provides a practical scheme for its management in clinical practice.",

CVD risk increases in a stepwise manner with increasing kidney impairment and is significantly reduced by kidney transplantation, suggesting a causal relationship. Dyslipidemia, a well recognised CVD risk factor, is highly prevalent in CKD. While dyslipidemia is a risk factor for CKD, kidney impairment can also induce a dyslipidemic state that may contribute to the excess burden of CVD in CKD.

There was no significant relationship between eGFR and low density lipoprotein (LDL) or total cholesterol in multivariate analysis. Kidney transplantation increased HDL (p < 0.0001) and decreased triglyceride (p = 0.007) concentration, whereas there was no significant change in LDL and total cholesterol. These effects were dependent on maintenance of graft function, statin therapy (those who were on) if graft failure occurred then HDL again decreased and triglycerides increased.",

We observed a statistical interaction between total serum cholesterol levels and statin use for the risk of haemorrhage (Interaction OR (IOR), 1.09; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.12). Increasing levels of total serum cholesterol were associated with a decreased risk of ICH within statin strata (average OR, 0.87; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.88 for every increase of 0.26\u2005mmol/l of total serum cholesterol concentrations), while statin use was associated with an increased risk (OR, 1.54; 95% CI 1.31 to 1.81 of the average level of total serum cholesterol).

    "68": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a relatively common autosomal dominant genetic condition leading to premature ischaemic vascular disease and mortality if left untreated. Currently, a universal consensus on the diagnostic criteria of FH does not exist but the diagnosis of FH largely relies on the evaluation of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, a careful documentation of family history, and the identification of clinical features. Diagnosis based purely on lipid levels remains common but there are several limitations to this method of diagnosis both practically and in the proportion of false-negatives and false-positives detected, resulting in substantial under-diagnosis of FH. In some countries, diagnostic algorithms are supplemented with genetic testing of the index case as well as genetic and lipid testing of relatives of the index case. Such \"cascade\" screening of families following identification of index cases appears to not only improve the rate of diagnosis but is also cost-effective. Currently, we observe a great variation in the excess mortality among patients with FH, which likely reflects a combination of additional genetic and environmental effects on risk overlaid on the risk associated with FH. Current accepted drug therapies for FH include statins and PSCK9 inhibitors. Further work is required to evaluate the cardiovascular disease risk in patients with genetically diagnosed FH and to determine whether a risk-based approach to the treatment of FH is appropriate.",

Although disproportionately increased aortic stiffness in diabetic hypertensives (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), no difference was found for PP amplification. The present dissociation between these two hemodynamic parameters may be related to the effect of increased heart rate (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) in the presence of diabetes, in men and women. In diabetic hypertensives, aortic stiffness was correlated with glycated hemoglobin level (P\u200a=\u200a0.04), but not with blood pressure or heart rate.

The surface morphology was determined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FSEM). Degradation in vitro was evaluated by monitoring the weight change of the composites soaked in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Drug release was evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cytotoxicity testing was performed to assess the biocompatibility of composites. Four 5 mm-diameter bone defects were created in rabbit calvaria. Three sites were filled with CS-GEL, 0.5 mg simvastatin-loaded CS-GEL (SIM-0.5) and 1.0 mg simvastatin-loaded CS-GEL (SIM-1.0), respectively, and the fourth was left empty as the control group. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histological analysis were carried out at 4 and 12 weeks postoperatively. The composites all exhibited three-dimensional structures and showed the residue with nearly 80% after 4 weeks of immersion. Drug release was explosive on the first day and then the release rate remained stable. The composites did not induce any cytotoxicity.

Recent studies in AD mouse models that recapitulate the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) pathology converge to demonstrate that it is possible to salvage cerebrovascular function with a variety of drugs and, particularly, therapies used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. These drugs can reestablish dilatory function mediated by various endothelial and smooth muscle ion channels as well as nitric oxide availability, benefits that result in normalized brain perfusion. These cerebrovascular benefits would favor brain perfusion, which may help maintain neuronal function and, possibly, delay cognitive failure. However, restoring cerebrovascular function in AD mouse models was not necessarily accompanied by rescue of cognitive deficits related to spatial learning and memory. The results with cardiovascular therapies rather suggest that drugs originally designed to treat cardiovascular diseases that concurrently restore cerebrovascular and cognitive function do so through their pleiotropic effects. Specifically, recent findings suggest that these drugs act directly on brain cells and neuronal pathways involved in memory formation, hence, working simultaneously albeit independently on neuronal and vascular targets. These findings may help select medications for patients with cardiovascular diseases at risk of developing AD with increasing age. Further, they may identify molecular targets for recovering memory pathways that bear potential for new therapeutic avenues.",

The level of confidence and replication of these findings varies, although several associations are likely true. Novel classes of lipid-lowering therapy have opened up new possibilities in the treatment of severe inherited forms of dyslipidemia, making the identification of such mutations an important pharmacogenetic predictor of failure of standard therapy, with potential response to novel therapy.

Allele scores based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously reported to be uniquely associated with each of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglyceride (TG) levels, were first validated in an independent dataset, and then entered into logistic regression models to estimate the presence (and direction) of any causal effect of each lipid trait on prostate cancer risk. There was weak evidence for an association between the LDL genetic score and cancer grade: the odds ratio (OR) per genetically instrumented standard deviation (SD) in LDL, comparing high- (\u22657 Gleason score) versus low-grade (<7 Gleason score) cancers was 1.50 (95% CI: 0.92, 2.46; P\u00a0=\u00a00.11).

In conclusion, circulating lipids, instrumented by our genetic risk scores, did not appear to alter prostate cancer risk.

A need for alternative disease-modifying therapies remains, specifically those that may have antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties that impact the pathophysiologic components of COPD. Statin drugs, the current gold standard for the treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), contain properties that affect the inflammatory disease processes seen in COPD. Several retrospective studies have demonstrated that statins may have a benefit in the reduction of morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD. This has led to prospective trials evaluating the impact of statins on various COPD-related outcomes. This article reviews the current body of prospective evidence for use of statins in patients with COPD. A search of the PubMed/Medline database of English-language articles was conducted from 1964 through November 2015; references of relevant articles were also reviewed for qualifying studies. Prospective studies of all types relating to statin use in patients with COPD were included if they had COPD- or respiratory-related outcomes; ultimately, eight studies were identified for this review. Statin effects on exacerbation rates, mortality, and inflammatory markers in patients with COPD are discussed. Strong prospective evidence does not currently exist to suggest that statins provide a clinical benefit in patients with COPD who do not have other CVD risk factors. Benefits from statins that have been illustrated are likely explained by their impact on underlying CVD risk factors rather than the COPD disease process.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of ACS-activated inflammation on adipokine imbalance and the effects of statins on the crosstalk between inflammation and adipokine imbalance during ACS. In this study, 586 subjects were categorized into: (1) control group; (2) SA (stable angina) group; and (3) ACS group. Circulating levels of hs-CRP, adiponectin and resistin were measured by ELISA. Furthermore, forty C57BL/6 mice were randomized into: sham, AMI, low-statin (atorvastatin, 2 mg/kg/day) and high-statin (atorvastatin, 20 mg/kg/day) group. After 3 weeks, AMI models were established by surgical coronary artery ligation. Circulating levels and adipose expressions of adiponectin and resistin were assessed in animals. Besides, we investigate the effects of atorvastatin on ox-LDL-induced adipokine imbalance in vitro. As a result, we found that ACS patients had higher hs-CRP and resistin levels and lower adiponectin levels. Our correlation analysis demonstrated hs-CRP concentrations were positively correlated with resistin but negatively with adiponectin levels in humans. Our animal findings indicated higher circulating hs-CRP and resistin levels and lower adiponectin levels in AMI mice. Atorvastatin pre-treatment dose-dependently decreased hs-CRP and resistin levels but increased adiponectin levels in mice. The consistent findings were observed about the adipose expressions of resistin and adiponectin in mice. In study in vitro, ox-LDL increased cellular resistin expressions and otherwise for adiponectin expressions, which dose-dependently reversed by the addition of atorvastatin. Therefore, our study indicates that the ACS attack activates inflammation leading to adipokine imbalance that can be ameliorated by anti-inflammation of atorvastatin.", 
    "146": "Rosuvastatin is a member of the statin family. Like the other statins it is prescribed to lower cholesterol levels and thereby reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Rosuvastatin lowers the cholesterol levels by inhibiting the key enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) in the cholesterol producing mevalonate pathway. It has been recognized that apart from their beneficial lipid lowering effects, statins also exhibit diabetogenic properties. The molecular mechanisms behind these remain unresolved. To investigate the effects of rosuvastatin on insulin secretion, we treated INS-1 832/13 cells with varying doses (20 nM to 20 \u03bcM) of rosuvastatin for 48 h. At concentrations of 2 \u03bcM and above basal insulin secretion was significantly increased. Using diazoxide we could determine that rosuvastatin did not increase basal insulin secretion by corrupting the KATP channels. Glucose-induced insulin secretion on the other hand seemed to be affected differently at different rosuvastatin concentrations. Rosuvastatin treatment (20 \u03bcM) for 24-48 h inhibited voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, which lead to reduced depolarization-induced exocytosis of insulin-containing granules. At lower concentrations of rosuvastatin (\u2264 2 \u03bcM) the stimulus-secretion coupling pathway was intact downstream of the KATP channels as assessed by the patch clamp technique. However, a reduction in glucose-induced insulin secretion could be observed with rosuvastatin concentrations as low as 200 nM. The inhibitory effects of rosuvastatin on glucose-induced insulin secretion could be reversed with mevalonate, but not squalene, indicating that rosuvastatin affects insulin secretion through its effects on the mevalonate pathway, but not through the reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis. Taken together, these data suggest that rosuvastatin has the potential to increase basal insulin secretion and reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion. The latter is possibly an unavoidable side effect of rosuvastatin treatment as it occurs through the same mechanisms as the lipid-lowering effects of the drug.",

Red yeast rice (RYR), a Chinese dietary product, contains a mixture of hypocholesterolemia agents such as statins. Typically, statins have this effect via the inhibition of HMG\u2011CoA reductase, the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Recently, statins have been shown to exhibit various beneficial antineoplastic properties through the disruption of tumor angiogenesis and metastatic processes. Mevinolin (MVN) is a member of statins and is abundantly present in RYR. Early experimental trials suggested that the mixed apoptotic/necrotic cell death pathway is activated in response to MVN exposure. In the current study, the cytotoxic profile of MVN was evaluated against MCF\u20117, a breast cancer\u2011derived cell line. The obtained results indicated that MVN\u2011induced cytotoxicity is multi\u2011factorial involving several regulatory pathways in the cytotoxic effects of MVN on breast cancer cell lines. In addition, MVN\u2011induced transcript abundance profiles inferred from microarrays showed significant changes in some key cell processes. The changes were predicted to induce cell cycle arrest and reactive oxygen species generation but inhibit DNA repair and cell proliferation. This MVN\u2011mediated multi\u2011factorial stress triggered specific programmed cell death (apoptosis) and DNA degradation responses in breast cancer cells. Taken together, the observed MVN\u2011induced effects underscore the potential of this ubiquitous natural compound as a selective anticancer activity, with broad safety margins and low cost compared to benchmarked traditional synthetic chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, the data support further pre\u2011clinical and clinical evaluations of MVN as a novel strategy to combat breast cancer and overcome drug resistance.",

Adjusted multivariate models showed that, compared to the SU group, adding a DPP-4 inhibitor was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR, 1.58; 95% CI: 1.48-1.68), while adding a TZD was associated with a reduced hazard (aHR, 0.45; 95% CI: 0.41-0.50). Baseline parameters associated with an increased hazard of intensification included HbA1c, diabetes duration, gender, smoking status and the use of statins.",

Adding a TZD to MET resulted in the most durable glycaemic response. Key messages The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has suggested that the durability of glycaemic response after treatment intensification is best investigated using well-designed long-term observational studies. In routine clinical practice, among patients with T2DM receiving a second line glucose lowering treatment as add-on to MET, the addition of a Thiazolidinediones is associated with the most durable glycaemic response, followed by a Sulfonylurea and then a DPP-4 inhibitor. Factors associated with earlier dual therapy failure included concomitant use of statin therapy, being female, a smoker, those with longer diabetes duration and higher baseline HbA1c levels. The addition of a Thiazolidinediones was associated with significant weight gain (1.8\u2009kg, p\u2009<\u20090.001), while add-on DPP-4 inhibitor produced a significant weight reduction (-1.8\u2009kg, p < 0.001).

Here, we hypothesized that cardioprotective effects of statins are mediated by small GTP-binding protein GDP dissociation stimulator (SmgGDS). SmgGDS(+/-) and wild-type (WT) mice were treated with continuous infusion of angiotensin II (Ang II) for 2 weeks with and without oral treatment with atorvastatin or pravastatin. At 2 weeks, the extents of Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were comparable between the 2 genotypes. However, statins significantly attenuated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis in WT mice, but not in SmgGDS(+/-) mice. In SmgGDS(+/-) cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), Rac1 expression, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 activity, Rho-kinase activity, and inflammatory cytokines secretion in response to Ang II were significantly increased when compared with WT CFs. Atorvastatin significantly reduced Rac1 expression and oxidative stress in WT CFs, but not in SmgGDS(+/-) CFs. Furthermore, Bio-plex analysis revealed significant upregulations of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and growth factors in SmgGDS(+/-) CFs when compared with WT CFs. Importantly, conditioned medium from SmgGDS(+/-) CFs increased B-type natriuretic peptide expression in rat cardiomyocytes to a greater extent than that from WT CFs. Furthermore, atorvastatin significantly increased SmgGDS secretion from mouse CFs. Finally, treatment with recombinant SmgGDS significantly reduced Rac1 expression in SmgGDS(+/-) CFs. These results indicate that both intracellular and extracellular SmgGDS play crucial roles in the inhibitory effects of statins on cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, partly through inhibition of Rac1, Rho kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways, demonstrating the novel mechanism of the pleiotropic effects of statins.",

In this report, we demonstrate the production of poly(tert-butyl 3,4-dihydroxybutanoate carbonate) from racemic-tert-butyl 3,4-epoxybutanoate (rac-(t)Bu 3,4-EB) and CO2 using bifunctional cobalt(III) salen catalysts. The copolymer exhibited greater than 99% carbonate linkages, 100% head-to-tail regioselectivity, and a glass-transition temperature (Tg) of 37 \u00b0C. By way of comparison, the similarly derived polycarbonate from the sterically less congested monomer, methyl 3,4-epoxybutanoate, displayed 91.8% head-to-tail content and a lower Tg of 18 \u00b0C. The tert-butyl protecting group of the pendant carboxylate group was removed using trifluoroacetic acid to afford poly(3,4-dihydroxybutyric acid carbonate). Depolymerization of poly(tert-butyl 3,4-dihydroxybutanoate carbonate) in the presence of strong base results in a stepwise unzipping of the polymer chain to yield the corresponding cyclic carbonate. Furthermore, the full degradation of the acetyl-capped poly(potassium 3,4-dihydroxybutyrate carbonate) resulted in formation of the biomasses, \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b3-butyrolacetone and 3,4-dihydroxybutyrate, in water (pH = 8) at 37 \u00b0C.

Multiple linear regression models were used to detect the association between time rate of BP variation and RHI.Among all the subjects (n = 61), the multiple linear regression models revealed that the daytime rate of systolic blood pressure (SBP) variation was independently associated with RHI (\u03b2 = -0.334, P = 0.008). A 0.1 mmHg/minute increase in the daytime rate of SBP variation correlated with a decline of 0.20 in RHI. The same effect was also found in the subjects with eGFR \u2265 60 mL/ (minute*1.73 m(2)). A greater association was found in those who were not taking a statin, \u03b2-blocker, ACEI/ARB, or diuretic and those without diabetes compared with those with any antihypertensive medication or with diabetes. Other ambulatory blood pressure parameters and central hemodynamics were not found to be associated with RHI.Our findings have shown that the daytime rate of SBP variation was associated with endothelial function in patients with metabolic syndrome, independent of other BP parameters and central hemodynamics.", 
    "221": "Statin therapy is the pharmacologic foundation of cholesterol treatment and the most common class of medication prescribed in the USA. The clinical benefits of statins and their favorable side effect profile have been well established for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease prevention. With new guidelines on the treatment of dyslipidemia being published in the last several years, a greater percentage of the population now appears eligible for statin therapy. In this review, we discuss the updated American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and National Lipid Association guidelines on lipid treatment, both of which endorse the importance of shared decision making and patient-centered care. We discuss factors beyond traditional risk factors that may be useful in refining risk-based decision making. Furthermore, we summarize the available statins, their potential benefits and limitations, and recent evidence on safety and tolerability.", 
    "222": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with a range of metabolic complications including insulin resistance (IR), obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These compound risks result in a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and possibly increased cardiovascular (CV) disease. As the cardiometabolic risk of PCOS is shared amongst the different diagnostic systems, all women with PCOS should undergo metabolic surveillance though the precise approach differs between guidelines. Lifestyle interventions consisting of increased physical activity and caloric restriction have been shown to improve both metabolic and reproductive outcomes. Pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery may be considered in resistant metabolic disease. Issues requiring further research include the natural history of PCOS-associated metabolic disease, absolute CV risk and comparative efficacy of lifestyle interventions.", 
    "223": "Hypercholesterolemia is a common condition and is a risk factor for tendon rupture, specifically in the supraspinatus tendon. In the clinic, statins are commonly prescribed to lower cholesterol, but little information is available examining the effect of statin treatment on the musculoskeletal system. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the biomechanical and histological effects of statin treatment in a diet-induced hypercholesterolemia model. We hypothesized that hypercholesterolemic rats treated with statins would have improved tendon biomechanical and histological properties compared to hypercholesterolemic rats not receiving daily statin treatment. Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats ate either high-cholesterol (HC) diet (n\u2009=\u200920) or normal chow (CTL, n\u2009=\u200910). After 6 months, a subset of HC rats began daily oral simvastatin dosing (HC+S) at 20\u2009mg/kg. All rats were sacrificed after a total of 9 months (3 months of statin treatment) and evaluated for histology and mechanics. For mechanics, at the insertion region, HC+S group had increased tendon cross-sectional area decreased and modulus. No differences were noted in mechanical properties at the midsubstance. For histology, no differences were noted in the insertion region. In the midsubstance region, HC+S group had more spindle shaped cells. Our results suggest that 3 months of simvastatin treatment in a diet-induced hypercholesterolemia rat model alters some tendon mechanical and histological properties, although a strong conclusion in support of improved parameters cannot be drawn. Therefore, we conclude that simvastatin treatment does not negatively affect tendon properties. \u00a9 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    "224": "Elevated triglyceride (TG) levels are associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, defined by the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel as a TG level of 177 to 885 mg/dl (2.0 to 10.0 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction remains the primary treatment goal. Using data from the indiVidual patient meta-analysis Of statin therapY in At risk Groups: Effects of Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin (VOYAGER) meta-analysis, we analyzed LDL-C and TG reductions in patients with baseline TG \u2265177 mg/dl (\u22652.0 mmol/L). Least squares mean percentage change from baseline in LDL-C and TG was compared using 15,800 patient exposures to rosuvastatin 5 to 40 mg, atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and simvastatin 10 to 80 mg in patients with baseline TG \u2265177 mg/dl (\u22652.0 mmol/L). Comparisons were made using mixed-effects models with data only from studies directly comparing treatments by randomized design. Mean LDL-C reductions ranged from -26.9% to -55.5%. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater LDL-C reductions than equal or double doses of atorvastatin and simvastatin (p <0.05). Mean TG reductions ranged from -15.1% to -31.3%. Rosuvastatin 10 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than atorvastatin 10 mg (p <0.05). Rosuvastatin 20 and 40 mg resulted in TG reductions similar to those with equal doses of atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg resulted in significantly greater TG reductions than equal or double doses of simvastatin (p <0.05). In conclusion, in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, LDL-C reduction was substantial and dependent on the choice and dose of statin. TG reduction was numerically less than for LDL-C, and additional TG-lowering therapy may be considered to further reduce residual cardiovascular risk.", 
    "225": "LDL cholesterol (LDLC) lowering has been revolutionized by PCSK9 inhibitors, Alirocumab (Praluent) and Evolocumab (Repatha), approved as adjuncts to maximally tolerated cholesterol lowering therapy in heterozygous (HeFH) or homozygous (HoFH) familial hypercholesterolemia, and/or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) where LDLC lowering is insufficient.", 
    "226": "We applied FDA and insurance eligibility criteria for PCSK9 inhibitor use in 734 hypercholesterolemic patients serially referred over 3 years who then received \u2265 2 months maximally tolerated LDLC lowering therapy with follow up LDLC \u2265 70 mg/dl, and in 50 patients approved by insurance for PCSK9 inhibitors. We documented the percentage of patients with HeFH and/or CVD who met FDA and insurance criteria for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy using LDLC goal-based guidelines.", 
    "227": "Of 734 patients with LDLC \u2265 70 mg/dl after \u2265 2 months maximally tolerated LDLC lowering therapy, 220 (30%) had HeFH and/or CVD with LDLC > 100 mg/dl, meeting FDA-insurance criteria for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy. Another 66 (9%) patients were statin intolerant, without HeFH or CVD. Of the 50 patients whose PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was approved for insurance coverage, 45 (90%) had LDLC > 100 mg/dl after \u2265 2 months on maximally tolerated LDLC lowering therapy. Seventeen of these 50 patients (34%) had HeFH without CVD (LDLC on treatment 180 \u00b1 50 mg/dl), 15 (30%) had CVD without HeFH (LDLC on treatment 124 \u00b1 26 mg/dl), 14 (28%) had both HeFH and CVD (LDLC on treatment 190 \u00b1 53 mg/dl), and 4 (8%) had neither HeFH nor CVD (LCLC 142 \u00b1 11 mg/dl).", 
    "228": "Of 734 patients referred for LDLC reduction, with LDLC \u2265 70 mg/dl after \u2265 2 months on maximally tolerated therapy, 220 (30%) had HeFH and/or CVD with LDLC > 100 mg/dl, meeting FDA-insurance criteria for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy as an adjunct to diet-maximally tolerated cholesterol lowering therapy in HeFH or CVD. If 30% of patients with high LDLC and HeFH-CVD are eligible for PCSK9 inhibitors, then specialty pharmaceutical pricing models (~$14,300/year) will collide with tens of millions of HeFH-CVD patients. We speculate that if there was a 50 % reduction in CVD, then there would be savings of $245 billion, in the middle of the range of estimated PCSK9 inhibitor costs of $185-342 billion. Whether the health care savings arising from the anticipated reduction of CVD events by PCSK9 inhibitors justify their extraordinary costs in broad population use remains to be determined.", 
    "229": "Simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering drug, has been shown to have positive effects on fracture healing and bone regeneration based on its dual effect; bone anabolic and anti-resorptive. In this study the focus has been on the anti-resorptive effect of the drug and its impact on the degradation of acidic calcium phosphate cement. The drug was added to the pre-mixed acidic cement in three different doses (0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/g cement) and the release was measured. Furthermore the effect of the loaded cements on osteoclast differentiation and resorption was evaluated by TRAP activity, number of multinucleated cells, gene expression and calcium ion concentration in vitro using murine bone marrow macrophages. The simvastatin did not affect the cell proliferation while it clearly inhibited osteoclastic differentiation at all three doses as shown by TRAP staining, TRAP activity and gene expression. Consistent with these results, simvastatin also impaired resorption of cements by osteoclasts as indicated by reduced calcium ion concentrations. In conclusion, our findings suggest that simvastatin-doped pre-mixed acidic calcium phosphate cement inhibits the osteoclastic mediated resorption of the cement thus slowing down the degradation rate. In addition with simvastatin's bone anabolic effect it makes the cement-drug combination a promising bone graft material, especially useful for sites with compromised bone formation.", 
    "230": "Dolichol, an end product of the mevalonate pathway, has been proposed as a biomarker of aging, but its biological role, not to mention its catabolism, has not been fully understood. UV-B radiation was used to induce oxidative stress in isolated rat hepatocytes by the collagenase method. Effects on dolichol, phospholipid-bound polyunsaturated fatty acids (PL-PUFA) and known lipid soluble antioxidants [coenzyme Q (CoQ) and \u03b1-tocopherol] were studied. The increase in oxidative stress was detected by a probe sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Peroxidation of lipids was assessed by measuring the release of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Dolichol, CoQ, and \u03b1-tocopherol were assessed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), PL-PUFA by gas-liquid chromatography (GC). UV-B radiation caused an immediate increase in ROS as well as lipid peroxidation and a simultaneous decrease in the levels of dolichol and lipid soluble antioxidants. Decrease in dolichol paralleled changes in CoQ levels and was smaller to that in \u03b1-tocopherol. The addition of mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoAR), magnified the loss of dolichol and was associated with an increase in TBARS production. Changes in PL-PUFA were minor. These findings highlight that oxidative stress has very early and similar effects on dolichol and lipid soluble antioxidants. Lower levels of dolichol are associated with enhanced peroxidation of lipids, which suggest that dolichol may have a protective role in the antioxidant machinery of cell membranes and perhaps be a key to understanding some adverse effects of statin therapy.", 
    "231": "Amino-bisphosphonates are antiresorptive drugs for the treatment of osteolytic bone metastases, which are frequently caused by breast and other solid tumors. Like statins, amino-bisphosphonates inhibit the mevalonate pathway. Direct anti-tumor effects of amino-bisphosphonates and statins have been proposed, although high concentrations are required to achieve these effects. Here, we demonstrate that the treatment of different human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-Bone, and MDA-Met) by combined inhibition of the mevalonate pathway using statins and zoledronic acid at the same time significantly reduces the concentrations required to achieve a meaningful anti-tumor effect over a single agent approach (50% reduction of cell vitality and 4-fold increase of apoptosis; p\u2009<\u20090.05). The effects were mediated by suppressed protein geranylation that caused an accumulation of GTP-bound RhoA and CDC42. Importantly, the knockdown of both proteins prior to mevalonate pathway inhibition reduced apoptosis by up to 65% (p\u2009<\u20090.01), indicating the accumulation of the GTP-bound GTPases as the mediator of apoptosis. Our results point to effective anti-tumor effects in breast cancer by the combination of statins and zoledronic acid and warrant further validation in preclinical settings."
