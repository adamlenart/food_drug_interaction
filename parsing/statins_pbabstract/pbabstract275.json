    "2": "Data were obtained from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study consisting of 7983 subjects aged>or=55 years. In the period 1992-1999, all patients starting statins for primary prevention were selected. Treatment eligibility was established according to Dutch guidelines based on considerations of cost effectiveness (1998) and European guidelines based on clinical effectiveness (1998 and 2003).", 
    "3": "Only 5.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.1, 8.3] of the 299 subjects starting statins for primary prevention met the eligibility criteria of the Dutch guidelines. Most patients (92.0%, 95% CI 88.9, 95.1) met the criteria of the 2003 European guidelines. Patients who did not meet any eligibility criteria were female and had one or less cardiovascular risk factor, except for two patients with total cholesterol levels<5 mmol l-1 prior to start of statin therapy.", 
    "4": "The use of statins was in agreement with the most recent European guidelines in over 90% of elderly patients who started statins for primary prevention, but in only 6% of these patients according to the Dutch guidelines. As long as existing guidelines are as discrepant as they are now, variation in agreement between physicians' prescribing and guideline recommendations is unavoidable.", 
    "5": "Although elderly patients represent a rapidly growing population often requiring multiple drug treatment, the evidence of effectiveness is limited for many interventions and therapies in this age group. Only during the last 30 years has a requirement to incorporate evidence into the treatment of older subjects become part of the pre- and postmarketing regulatory process in Europe and the United States. Recently, elderly patients have been shown to benefit comparably from several treatments. These studies have supported the validity of an increasingly interventional approach to disorders common in late life. However, an important issue is the applicability of the growing body of clinical trials to 'real life' patients. This is particularly true in very old (i.e. >80 years) patients and those with significant comorbidities. We review the current evidence and controversies related to the effectiveness and safety of several therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular disease (i.e. statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, and thrombolytic agents) and bone health (i.e. vitamin D and bisphosphonates).", 
    "6": "The relationship between dietary composition/cholesterol-lowering therapy and final plasma lipid levels is to some extent genetically determined. It is clear that these responses are under polygenic control, with multiple variants in many genes participating in the total effect (and with each gene contributing a relatively small effect). Using different experimental approaches, several candidate genes have been analyzed to date.Interesting and consistent results have been published recently regarding the A-204C promoter variant in the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) gene. CYP7A1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis and therefore plays an important role in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis. CYP7A1-204CC homozygotes have the greatest decrease in total cholesterol level in response to dietary changes in different types of dietary intervention studies. In contrast, one study has reported that the effect of statins in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels was slightly greater in -204AA homozygotes. The CYP7A1 A-204C variant accounts for a significant proportion of the genetic predisposition of the response of plasma cholesterol levels.", 
    "7": "In patients with chronic kidney disease, treatment with statins presumably not only has an influence on cardiovascular endpoints, but also delays the progression of the renal disease. Recommendations for the treatment of lipid metabolism disorders in the general population with normal renal function are based on numerous prospective, randomized and placebo-controlled studies. In contrast, recommendations for patients with pathological renal function can merely be extrapolated from the results of those studies. Post hoc analyses from the large pravastatin studies confirm a significant risk reduction of primary cardiovascular and cerebrovascular end points for the CDK stages 2 and 3. For CKD stages 4 and 5, available data are merely rudimentary, so that the results of ongoing studies will have to be awaited.", 
    "8": "Diabetic dyslipoproteinemia is considered to be an integral component of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. Major pathogenetic factors include abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia with increased hepatic secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Elevated concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol, together with decreased HDL cholesterol are therefore found. LDL cholesterol is either normal or only slightly increased, but at the same time, the composition of the LDL particles is altered. This metabolic disorder contributes considerably to the clearly elevated cardiovascular risk. Dyslipoproteinemia, usually in the form of hypertriglyceridemia, may also occur in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Since general measures and good blood sugar control often fail to achieve the desired lipid levels, many patients require medication, initially usually statins, but, where necessary, combination treatment. In patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, treatment with fibrates may also be considered.", 
    "9": "Vascular damage occurring after cerebral ischemia may lead to a worse outcome in patients with ischemic stroke, as it facilitates edema formation and hemorrhagic transformation. There are several phases in the development of vascular injury (acute, subacute and chronic) and different mediators act in each one. Therapeutic options to avoid vascular injury must be focused on acting in each phase. However, even though experimental studies have demonstrated the benefit of therapeutic interventions both in the acute and chronic phases of cerebral ischemia, only the chronic phase offers a therapeutic window sufficiently wide enough to provide vascular protection in clinical practice. Several drugs including erythropoietin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), antihypertensive (angiotensin modulators), antibiotics (minocycline) and antihyperglycemic drugs (thiazolidinediones) have been proved to provide vascular protection in patients with ischemic stroke. Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic actions are responsible for the vascular protective effect related to these drugs.",

Treatment of leaf organs with fosmidomycin resulted in dose dependent inhibition of chlorophylls, carotenoids, scopadulcic acid B (SDB) and phytol production, and no effect on sterol production was observed. In response to the pravastatin treatment, a significant decrease in sterol and perturbation of SDB production was observed.",

Red yeast rice is typical product in Mingbei area of Fujian province. Nine products from different area were measured, using high-performance chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detector (PDA) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and the results show that the contents of monacolin K in these products were considerably different, and more than the other product.",

Participants were randomly assigned to lovastatin in low (mean 4 mg) or high (mean 76 mg) doses and to low-dose warfarin (mean international normalized ratio [INR] 1.4, goal INR <2.0) or placebo in a factorial design. Participants underwent routine measurement of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and INR levels every 6 to 12 weeks for 4 to 5 years.

Maximum INR (P = .72) and ALT (P = .51) levels did not differ across categories of alcohol intake. The risks of an INR of 2.0 or higher were 67%, 66%, 68%, and 61% among non-, light, moderate, and heavier drinkers (P = .86), respectively. The corresponding risks of an ALT of 80 IU/L or more were 8%, 10%, 9%, and 6% (P = .70), respectively.",

    "16": "Fear of muscle toxicity remains a major reason that patients with hyperlipidemia are undertreated. Recent evaluations of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis offer new insights on the clinical management of both muscle symptoms and hyperlipidemia after rhabdomyolysis. The incidence of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis is higher in practice than in controlled trials in which high-risk subjects are excluded. Accepted risks include age; renal, hepatic, and thyroid dysfunction; and hypertriglyceridemia. New findings suggest that exercise, Asian race, and perioperative status also may increase the risk of statin muscle toxicity. The proposed causes and the relationship of drug levels to statin rhabdomyolysis are briefly reviewed along with the problems with the pharmacokinetic theory. Data suggesting that patients with certain metabolic abnormalities are predisposed to statin rhabdomyolysis are presented. The evaluation and treatment of patients' muscle symptoms and hyperlipidemia after statin rhabdomyolysis are presented. Patients whose symptoms are related to other disorders need to be identified. Lipid management of those whose symptoms are statin-related is reviewed including treatment suggestions.", 
    "17": "Recent studies have suggested that statins reduce the rate of subsequent coronary events when these drugs are indicated early alter an acute coronary event. One potential mechanism by which these drugs might reduce the likelihood of such events is by enhancing endothelial function. The aim of this study was to determine whether early cholesterol reduction with atorvastatin improved endothelial function after acute myocardial infarction in patients with normal cholesterol levels.", 
    "18": "Patients with a first acute myocardial infarction and normal levels of cholesterol were assigned to treatment with 10 mg atorvastatin (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15) for 8 weeks. Patients who had previously received treatment with statins were excluded. Brachial ultrasound was used to measure endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation and response to endothelium-independent nitroglycerin. Total and LDL cholesterol levels and the distribution of risk factors were similar on admission and before randomization in both groups. All patients were assessed between 5 and 7 days postinfarction and after 8 weeks.",

The number of respondents who thought that stroke units were efficacious has increased (57% in 1997 to 89%, P < 0.001). The use of aspirin acutely (P < 0.001) and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (P = 0.006) has also increased. In 2004, antihypertensive therapy for secondary stroke prevention would be commenced if the blood pressure was 150/90 by 98% of respondents and 140/90 by 70% of respondents.

Fluvastatin treatment decreased total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol significantly (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). No significant effect of fluvastatin was observed on plasma insulin or adiponectin or on the HOMA index.", 
    "29": "Fluvastatin does not improve plasma adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity, despite its beneficial effects on lipid levels.

    "30": "The electrochemical behavior and determination of simvastatin (SMV), a lipid-lowering drug, were studied in aqueous alcohol medium at a stationary glassy carbon electrode. Cyclic voltammetry studies showed one main, well-defined, sharp oxidation peak between pH 2 and 8. The oxidation was irreversible and exhibited a diffusion controlled mechanism. Differential pulse and square wave voltammetric methods for the quantitative determination of SMV in pharmaceutical dosage forms and spiked serum samples were developed based on the linear relationship between the peak current and the concentration. Differential pulse and square wave voltammetric techniques for the determination of SMV in 0.1 M H2SO4 and a constant amount of methanol (20%), which allow quantitation over the 2 x 10(-6)-1 x 10(-4) M range in supporting electrolyte with a detection limit of 2.71 x 10(-7) M and 5.50 x 10(-7) M for differential pulse and square wave voltammetric methods, respectively, are proposed. The repeatability and reproducibility of the methods were determined. Precision and accuracy were also checked. These methods were used for the determination of SMV in tablets. The standard addition method was used in biological media. No electroactive interferences from endogenous substances and excipients were found in biological fluids and pharmaceutical dosage forms, respectively.",

    "32": "The present study was examined the effect of fluvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on Cu(II)-induced hydroxyl radical generation (OH) in the extracellular fluid of rat myocardium. Rats were anesthetized and sodium salicylate in Ringer's solution (0.5 nmol/microl/min) was infused through a microdialysis probe to detect the generation of OH as reflected by the non-enzymatic formation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) in the myocardium. When Cu(II) was infused through the microdialysis probe, Cu(II) increased in OH formation trapped as 2,3-DHBA in the dialysate. When fluvastatin (100 microM) was administered to Cu(II) (50 microM)-pretreated animals, the levels of 2,3-DHBA at 300 min after administration of fluvastatin significantly decreased. In cumulative dose dependent experiments, three concentrations of Cu(II), 10, 25 and 50 microM, were infused through the microdialysis probe in the rat myocardium. A positive linear correlation between Cu(II) and the formation of 2,3-DHBA (R(2)=0.980) was observed. However, when corresponding experiments were performed with fluvastatin (100 microM) pretreated animals, the level of 2,3-DHBA decreased. These results suggest that blocking LDL oxidation by fluvastatin may attenuate Cu(II)-induced OH formation in the rat heart.",

Hind-limb blood flow was evaluated using Laser Doppler perfusion imager (LDPI) before treatment and after operation of hind-limbs. The capillaries in muscle of limbs were counted by means of CD-31 labeled immuno-fluorescence. The phosphorylation of Akt (Protein kinase B) in cells was measured by direct immunohistochemical technique. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) in muscle of limbs was assessed using Western blotting.", 
    "35": "After treatment of Pitavastatin, the blood flow in ischemic limbs of the Kl +/- and wild mice improved obviously, the ratio of blood flow area in ischemic limb to that in non-ischemic limb increased and the density of capillaries increased in ischemic limbs of the Kl +/- and wild mice.

Lipids normalized only after liver transplantation (total cholesterol, 135 mg/dL; LDL cholesterol, 60 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 48 mg/dL; triglycerides, 130 mg/dL). To the best of our knowledge, the dramatic improvement in the lipid profile after liver transplantation represents the first such published report for PSC. The recognition of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis in those with cholestatic liver disease and the normalization of lipid profile after liver transplantation warrant further study. We present a review of dyslipidemia in cholestatic liver disease, its relationship to atherosclerosis, and its treatment.",

PLTP activity is elevated in patients with diabetes, a condition with strongly elevated risk for coronary heart disease. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that statins reduce PLTP activity and to examine the potential role of apolipoprotein E (apoE). PLTP activity and apoE were measured in patients with type 2 diabetes from the DALI (Diabetes Atorvastatin Lipid Intervention) Study, a 30-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial with atorvastatin (10 and 80 mg daily). At baseline, PLTP activity was positively correlated with waist circumference, HbA(1c), glucose, and apoE (all P < 0.05). Atorvastatin treatment resulted in decreased PLTP activity (10 mg atorvastatin: -8.3%, P < 0.05; 80 mg atorvastatin: -12.1%, P < 0.002). Plasma apoE decreased by 28 and 36%, respectively (P < 0.001). The decrease in apoE was strongly related to the decrease in PLTP activity (r = 0.565, P < 0.001). The change in apoE remained the sole determinant of the change in PLTP activity in a multivariate model. The activity of PLTP in type 2 diabetes is decreased by atorvastatin. The association between the decrease in PLTP activity and apoE during statin treatment supports the hypothesis that apoE may prevent PLTP inactivation.",

We estimate that increasing statin prescribing among patients least likely to receive them (ie, the lowest quintile of propensity to receive a prescription at discharge) from the current rate of 7.8% to the rate among all patients (35.6%) could decrease AMI mortality by 83 deaths in Ontario per year (2.1% of all post-AMI deaths within 3 years of discharge). Increasing statin prescribing to 70% among all patients with AMI could avert 312 deaths per year in Ontario. Factoring in low rates of adherence to statin therapy would reduce these estimates to 33 and 126, respectively.", 
    "63": "Modest increases in statin prescribing for patients least likely to receive one could decrease post-AMI mortality at the population level.", 
    "64": "Many clinical trials have clearly demonstrated the benefit of statins in the prevention of coronary heart disease. Although other effects have subsequently been described, the so-called pleiotropic effects of statins, there is a tendency to relate all those effects, more or less directly, to inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. Several clinical and laboratory studies show an association between statins and increased bone formation and/or density, but no clear explanation for that statin effect has emerged. We therefore hypothetized that statins may have an effect on alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), an enzyme with an important role in bone mineralization and that may also contribute to pathological mineralization in other tissues, such as vascular calcification. Our experience with drug effects on ALP lead us to admit the possibility of finding a statin with an ALP increasing effect on bone but not on vascular tissue, or with a more marked effect upon one of the ALP isoforms or isoenzymes. That information would allow the design of clinical trials to confirm the suitability of a specific statin to a specific clinical condition.",

Subjects with LDL-C >2.6 mmol/L (100mg/dL) but <or=5.7 mmol/L (220 mg/dL) were assigned a starting dose of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40 or 80 mg/day) based on LDL-C and status of statin use at baseline, with a single uptitration at 6 weeks, if required. There was no washout for ST subjects. At study end, 80% of SF (82%, 82%, 83% and 72% with 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) and 59% of ST (60%, 61% and 51% with 20, 40 and 80 mg, respectively) subjects reached LDL-C target.

    "68": "Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women has until now been treated with antiresorptive agents, reducing the incidence of fragility fracture by approximately 50%. Clinical research has led to the development of new anabolic therapies capable of increasing the production of bone matrix by osteoblasts and reversing microarchitectural deterioration, resulting in major improvements in both bone quality and bone quantity. Teriparatide, a recombinant human parathyroid hormone consisting of the first 34 of 84 amino acids in human parathyroid hormone, has been shown to reduce significantly the risk of both vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. This agent was recently approved for use in Canada. Strontium ranelate is a new oral agent capable of uncoupling bone resorption from bone formation, which results in increases in bone formation with reductions in bone resorption. This agent has also been shown to reduce the risk of both vertebral and non-vertebral fracture while improving bone structure. Anabolic therapies represent a major advance in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis, and they may provide significant benefit to those patients with severe osteoporosis in whom antiresorptive therapy has proven insufficient. Anabolic therapies should complement the antiresorptive treatments currently available for use in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.", 
    "69": "Migraine is a common and disabling neurological disorder. Studies have shown that patients with migraine (especially those with typical aura with migraine) have an unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile and an increased risk of early-onset (<45 years) ischemic stroke. Statins are effective hypolipidemic drugs that reduce cardiovascular-related morbidity and death in patients with or without established atherosclerotic vascular disease. We report a patient whose frequent attacks of typical aura with migraine completely resolved after the initiation of treatment with a statin. In this context, we comment on the possible effects of statins on the pathophysiology of migraine. We suggest that statins may be useful drugs in the treatment of migraine because they could reduce the increased cardiovascular risk in these patients and also attenuate migraine attacks. Only a randomized prospective study in this population could provide a definite answer to these speculations.",

Antimutagenicity of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylgutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors atorvastatin and lovastatin was studied using the Ames Salmonella typhimurium assay. Directly acting mutagens, sodium azide (NaN(3)) and 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine (NPDA), were used to induce mutation in Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100. The antimutagenicity of lovastatin and atorvastatin was found to be significant (p < 0.01) and dose-dependent. The percentage inhibition of a 3 mg lovastatin-treated plate was found to be 79.9% and 61.8% against NPDA- and NaN(3)-induced mutation to TA98 and TA100, respectively. Atorvastatin (0.5 mg/plate) inhibited NPDA-and NaN(3)-induced mutation to TA98 and TA100 by 78.6% and 45.5%, respectively. Atorvastatin showed antimutagenic activity at lower concentrations than lovatstatin.

Modulation of post-translational protein prenylation seems to be a key mechanism by which statins alter immune function.

    "103": "Statins are an established therapeutic modality for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Although they generally exhibit a good efficacy and tolerability profile, their reputation has been tarnished as a result of reports of myotoxicity and, more recently, observations of proteinuria. The increased incidence of proteinuria with rosuvastatin was of particular concern, and raised questions about the renoprotective actions of statins. Different hypotheses have been put forward to explain the mechanisms of statin-induced proteinuria. The multifarious effects of statins, independent of their effects on cholesterol-lowering, form the basis of such hypotheses. However, rosuvastatin-associated proteinuria is transient and reversible and even at the highest dose did not affect renal function after prolonged treatment. It would appear that clinically relevant proteinuria is not associated solely with rosuvastatin and might represent a minor class effect of statins with a fairly low incidence. However, definitive proof of this assertion will need to be provided by rigorous testing.", 
    "104": "Ischemic reperfusion injury is an important cause of renal dysfunction after major vascular surgery and increases postoperative morbidity and mortality. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of statins on renal function in patients at high risk for renal dysfunction, that is, those who underwent suprarenal aortic cross clamping-declamping. Seventy-seven patients (28 statin users, 57 men; mean age 69 +/- 8 years) with normal preoperative renal function requiring suprarenal aortic cross clamping-declamping during vascular surgery from 1995 to 2005 were studied. Creatinine levels were obtained before surgery and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 30 after surgery. An analysis-of-variance model for repeated measurements was applied to compare creatinine levels between statin users and nonusers, with adjustment for clamping time and blood loss. There were no differences in baseline clinical characteristics, preoperative creatinine levels (0.93 vs 0.96 mg/dl, p = 0.59), and glomerular filtration rate (79 vs 73 ml/min, p = 0.1). Postoperative creatinine levels during the 30 days after surgery were significantly lower in statin users than in nonusers (analysis-of-variance p <0.01, 1.17 vs 1.98 mg/dl). Postoperative hemodialysis was required (temporarily) in 7 patients (9.1%), all statin nonusers. These findings suggest an association between statin use and preserved renal function after suprarenal aortic clamping.", 
    "105": "We investigated whether, in primary prevention patients with metabolic syndrome, statins affect the platelet protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) thrombin receptor by performing serial measurements of its activity and the antigen expression level by flow cytometry before and during treatment. Recent data from randomized trials of statins are compatible with the possibility of clinically relevant pleiotropic effects. The use of statins is associated with a reduced thrombosis burden and diminished platelet activity, as shown in animal models and in vitro studies. Seventy patients with the metabolic syndrome who were not taking antiplatelet agents were assigned consecutively at starting doses at the discretion of the responsible clinician to 1 of 6 statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin) or to a no-statin group for 6 weeks. Platelet expression of intact (SPAN12 antibody) and cleaved (WEDE15) PAR-1 thrombin receptors were assessed by flow cytometry at baseline and at weeks 4 and 6 of treatment. At baseline, no difference was found in receptor expression. However, after 4 weeks of treatment, all statins had significantly inhibited (46% to 55%) the activated epitope of PAR-1 expression. After 6 weeks, inhibition remained, despite a slight rebound (22% to 37%). Also, a delayed pattern of inhibition of the intact PAR-1 receptor epitope was found. In conclusion, all statins inhibited the activity and antigen level of the platelet PAR-1 thrombin receptor, which has a major role in regulating platelet activity and thrombin formation. These observational data offer a plausible mechanism for the recently demonstrated pleiotropic effects of statins that may contribute to early clinical benefit.", 
    "106": "The study was designed to assess blood platelet sensitivity to acetylsalicylic acid and its associations with dyslipidaemia and inflammation in coronary artery disease patients. Platelet non-responsiveness to aspirin is associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events. Several environmental and hereditary factors are reportedly involved in sub-optimal acetylsalicylic acid response. Forty-five coronary artery disease patients and 45 non-coronary artery disease controls received acetylsalicylic acid at a daily dose of 75-150 mg. Controls were examined twice: on the day of entering the study and 10 days later. Urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 was assessed as the marker of platelet thromboxane generation. Aggregation was studied in platelet-rich plasma using turbidimetric aggregometry with collagen and arachidonic acid. Fifty to seventy percent of coronary artery disease patients showed an extent of collagen-induced aggregation above the upper quartile of the reference range compared with 8-15% in controls (P<0.003). For arachidonic acid-activated aggregation these proportions were 45-50% in coronary artery disease versus 7% in controls (P<0.007). In coronary artery disease patients, the acetylsalicylic acid-mediated platelet inhibition positively correlated with increased triglycerides (in arachidonic acid-stimulated platelets, r=0.30, P=0.0018), total cholesterol (r=0.33, P<0.0001 in coll and arachidonic acid-activated platelets) and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) (r=0.27, P=0.0024). In coronary artery disease patients urine 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 concentrations were significantly increased compared to controls after 10 day acetylsalicylic acid intake (563; 313-728 pg/mg creatinine versus 321; 246-488 pg/mg creatinine, P=0.04). The incidence of suboptimal acetylsalicylic acid response incidence was more common in patients with coronary artery disease. Acetylsalicylic acid inhibition of blood platelet reactivity and thromboxane generation was less effective in these patients. Dyslipidaemia and chronic inflammatory states may promote suboptimal acetylsalicylic acid response in coronary artery disease patients.", 
    "107": "In the past years, statins have emerged as the most important class of lipid lowering agents. Through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, they restrict the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, which leads to upregulation of LDL receptors on the cell membrane and thus reduction of atherogenic LDLs. This effect translates into clinical benefit by reducing cardiovascular events both in primary and secondary prevention settings. As an approximate rule, statin therapy leads to a relative risk reduction of 25-30% in most of the large randomised controlled trials. Stroke risk is reduced to a similar degree. Despite initial concerns, the currently available statins have a favourable safety profile; however, potential interactions with other drugs must be considered. Recently, characteristics unrelated to LDL lowering have been intensively studied. These pleiotropic statin effects result from decreased levels of isoprenoid intermediates of cholesterol synthesis. They include--among others--anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and immunomodulatory actions. Pleiotropic effects favourably influence pathomechanisms of plaque formation. Furthermore, they may prove beneficial in the prevention or treatment of diseases unrelated to atherosclerosis, eg rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, or cancer.", 
    "108": "Nitrate tolerance is associated with an enhanced superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) production and may be attenuated by statins as they interact with the two main endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase pathways involved in this oxidative stress. Groups of wild-type (wt, C57Bl/6J) and eNOS knock-out mice (eNOS(-/-)) received rosuvastatin (20 mg kg(-1) day(-1) p.o.) for 5 weeks and a cotreatment with the statin plus nitroglycerin (NTG; 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1), subcutaneous injections b.i.d.) for the last 4 days. Another group received only NTG (30 mg kg(-1) d(-1), b.i.d. for 4 days) and finally control mice from both strains received no treatment. Rings of thoracic aortas from these groups were studied in organ baths. Relaxations to NTG (0.1 nM-0.1 mM) were determined on thromboxane analogue (U44619)-precontracted rings and O(2)(-) production (RLU 5 s(-1) mg(-1) of total protein content) was assessed in aorta homogenates with the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence technique. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed on aortas from both mice strains. In vivo NTG treatment induced a significant rightward shift of the concentration-effect curve to NTG compared to control group. There was, however, no cross-tolerance with non-nitrate sources of NO (unaltered response to acetylcholine in wt group). The rosuvastatin + NTG cotreatment was able to protect against the development of nitrate tolerance in both mice strains and L-mevalonate abolished this protective effect of rosuvastatin. In vivo treatment with apocynin, a purported NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, also produced a similar protection to that observed with rosuvastatin in both strains. Superoxide anion formation was increased after NTG treatment in both mice strains and the rosuvastatin + NTG cotreatment was able to reduce that production. Moreover, rosuvastatin treatment abolished the increase in gp91phox mRNA (an endothelial membrane NAD(P)H oxidase subunit) expression induced by in vivo exposure to NTG. These findings suggest that long-term rosuvastatin treatment protects against nitrate tolerance by counteracting NTG-induced increase in O(2)(-) production, probably via a direct interaction with the NAD(P)H oxidase pathway.", 
    "109": "Oxidative stress and apoptosis are 2 major characteristics of the progression of atherosclerosis. Both lovastatin and Magnolia officinalis are hypocholesterolemic agents. Therefore, we investigated the effect of M. officinalis extract on the prevention of atherosclerosis in comparison with lovastatin. Twenty hyperlipidemic rabbits were served one of the following diets: a high-fat and cholesterol diet (cholesterol group, 10% corn oil and 0.5% cholesterol), a high fat and cholesterol diet supplemented with M. officinalis extract (300 mg/kg) or lovastatin (6 mg/kg). The plasma lipids, oxidative stress (measured by free radical, malondialdehyde, and oxidative DNA damage), and arterial lesions significantly decreased in the M. officinalis and lovastatin groups when compared with the cholesterol group. Moreover, the expressions of Fas ligand, caspase 8, and caspase 9 in the aortic arches were also markedly lowered after M. officinalis and lovastatin supplements. Therefore, the results indicate that the antiatherogenic effect of M. officinalis is involved with a suppression of oxidative stress and with the down-regulation of apoptosis-related gene expression in hyperlipidemic rabbits.", 
    "110": "The aim of our study was to explore some potential ple\u00efotropic effects of atorvastatin, after stenting in the iliac arteries of normocholesterolemic rabbits. On day 0, 27 rabbits underwent stent implantation and were randomized into either the control group (standard chow, CTRL, n = 15) or the atorvastatin group (10 mg/kg/d per os, Ator, n = 12). On day 30, the stented arteries were harvested for histomorphometry and neointimal analysis [macrophages, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, vascular smooth muscle cells, and collagen]. Atorvastatin did not induce significant histomorphometric and inflammatory modifications but reduced neointimal expression of MMP-2 with no modification of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, and also induced higher neointimal collagen content (Ator vs. CTRL: MMP-2: 0.05 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.20, P < 0.01; collagen: 17.0+/-0.7%/mm vs. 12.0 +/- 1.2%/mm(2) P < 0.01).

    "111": "The pleiotropic effects of statins represent potential mechanisms for the treatment of end-organ damage in hypertension. This study has investigated the effects of rosuvastatin in a model of cardiovascular remodeling, the DOCA-salt hypertensive rat. Male Wistar rats weighing 300 to 330 g were uninephrectomized (UNX) or UNX and treated with DOCA (25 mg subcutaneously every fourth day) and 1% NaCl in the drinking water. Compared with UNX controls, DOCA-salt rats developed hypertension, cardiovascular hypertrophy, inflammation with perivascular and interstitial cardiac fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and prolongation of ventricular action potential duration at 28 days. Rosuvastatin-treated rats received 20 mg/kg/d of the drug in 10% Tween 20 by oral gavage for 32 days commencing 4 days before uninephrectomy. UNX and DOCA-salt controls received vehicle only. Rosuvastatin therapy attenuated the development of cardiovascular hypertrophy, inflammation, fibrosis, and ventricular action potential prolongation, but did not modify hypertension or vascular dysfunction. We conclude that the pleiotropic effects of rosuvastatin include attenuation of aspects of cardiovascular remodeling in the DOCA-salt model of hypertension in rats without altering systolic blood pressure.", 
    "112": "Several emerging plasma biomarkers may ultimately prove useful in risk stratification and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. The clinical utility of these biomarkers will depend on their ability to provide a reflection of the underlying atherosclerotic burden or activity; the ability to provide reliable, accurate, and cost-effective information; and the ability to predict future events. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) fulfills many, if not all, of these criteria, and blood levels of hs-CRP are now commonly used in clinical practice to improve vascular risk prediction in primary and secondary prevention across all levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), all levels of the Framingham Risk Score, and all levels of metabolic syndrome. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein may also have clinical relevance as an adjunct to LDL-C for both the targeting and monitoring of statin therapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that several other selected emerging biomarkers may also potentially prove useful in the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. Specifically, data are accumulating on the potential clinical utility of lipoprotein-associated lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, myeloperoxidase, oxidized LDL, lipoprotein (a), isoprostanes, and small, dense LDL. This review focuses on hs-CRP and these emerging plasma biomarkers, and their potential diagnostic and prognostic utility in cardiovascular disease. Plasma biomarkers that reflect the clinical potential of atherothrombotic disease may allow more precise risk stratification and prognostication in high-risk populations, and perhaps earlier diagnosis and intervention in patients at risk for or with occult cardiovascular disease.", 
    "113": "Ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, can be combined with statins to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. We have previously shown that ezetimibe can decrease LDL cholesterol by 16% even in patients treated by regular LDL apheresis and statins (Atherosclerosis. 2005;180:107-112). However, it is unclear whether ezetimibe decreases all LDL subfractions equally in patients with hypercholesterolemia. We therefore evaluated the effect of ezetimibe (5 weeks, 10 mg/d) on LDL subtype distribution in a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized crossover study in 20 patients (age, 56+/-9 years; body mass index, 27.5+/-4 kg/m2) with severe hyperlipoproteinemia and coronary heart disease who are treated by statins and regular LDL apheresis. Both treatment periods (placebo and ezetimibe) were separated by a 5-week washout period. Low-density lipoprotein subtype distribution was determined at the end of each treatment period before apheresis by density gradient ultracentrifugation (LDL1, 1.020-1.024; LDL2, 1.025-1.029; LDL3, 1.030-1.034; LDL4, 1.035-1.040; LDL5, 1.041-1.047; LDL6, 1.048-1.057; LDL7, 1.058-1.066 g/mL). Overall, the LDL subtype distribution did not change significantly (large-buoyant LDL [LDL1+LDL2], 17.2%+/-6.4% vs 16.3%+/-7.1%; intermediate LDL [LDL3+LDL4], 49.3%+/-4.5% vs 48.2%+/-5.2%; small-dense LDL [LDL5+LDL6+LDL7], 33.5%+/-8.0% vs 35.5%+/-10% during placebo and ezetimibe treatments, respectively). With respect to the individual LDL subfractions, cholesterol was significantly (P<.05, Wilcoxon test) reduced by ezetimibe in LDL1 to LDL5 with a somewhat more pronounced reduction in larger LDL (mean+/-SD, -20%+/-28%, -17%+/-32%, -14%+/-25%, -13%+/-27%, -11%+/-21%, -7%+/-21%, -4%+/-19%; median, -28%, -12%, -18%, -16%, -4%, -4%, -2% for LDL subfractions 1-7, respectively). We therefore conclude that ezetimibe decreases cholesterol in nearly all LDL subfractions. Although this was established in patients concomitantly treated with statins and apheresis, this may also hold true in other clinically relevant situations.",

PBMCs from seven healthy subjects were stimulated with PHA. The effects of fluvastatin on cell proliferation and production of cytokines (interferon [IFN]-gamma and interleukin [IL]-5) and chemokines (chemokine CXC motif, ligand [CXCL10], and CC chemokine ligand [CCL17]) were measured. Migration of T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cell lines was also investigated. The expression of CXCR3 and CCR4 was analysed with flow cytometry.

Culture supernatants obtained in the presence of fluvastatin prevented the migration of Th1 and Th2 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.

    "123": "Currently the apolipoprotein B:AI ratio integrates information about the potential for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction better than any other lipid or lipoprotein index. Certainly it could, with benefit, replace serum cholesterol and HDL cholesterol in the estimation of CVD risk. Defining the therapeutic target of statin therapy in terms of serum apolipoprotein B (apo B) rather than LDL cholesterol could also help to optimize statin treatment. Deciding whether a therapeutic response is adequate also requires knowledge of whether there is persisting hypertriglyceridaemia, because this gives an indication of whether small dense LDL is likely to have been satisfactorily reduced. Raising low levels of HDL, probably best measured as apo AI, may also prove to be an important aim of treatment. This is, however, a more complex issue and also depends on the mechanism by which a particular therapy alters HDL levels and on whether the capacity of HDL to perform its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative functions is restored. A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of statins in which apo B and apo AI have been reported could provide valuable information.", 
    "124": "To investigate the anti-cardiac hypertrophic mechanism of statins, thirty-eight male Wistar rats were randomly allocated to four groups. Rats in model group received nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) 15 mg/(kg.d) by peritoneal injection. Rats in simvastatin treatment groups were given simultaneously L-NNA as those in model group and simvastatin 5 or 30 mg/(kg.d) intragastrically respectively. Rats in control group received the same volume of normal sodium. Left ventricular function, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), the content of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in plasma and myocardium, myocardial hydroxyproline and heme oxygenase activity were determined after 6 weeks. The results showed that rats in model group developed significant cardiac hypertrophy associated with reduced left ventricular function compared with the control group. However, compared with the model group, L-NNA-induced cardiac hypertrophy of rats was significantly relieved in simvastatin treatment groups, associated with improved left ventricular function, decreased LVMI, lower BNP levels in plasma and myocardium, lower content of myocardial hydroxyproline, and increased myocardial heme oxygenase (HO) activity. In cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, simvastatin (30 or 100 mumol/L) significantly increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA expression, HO activity as well as the production of CO in cardiomyocytes. Cultured with zinc protoporphyrin, a HO inhibitor, or simvastatin alone did not change [(3)H]leucine uptake of cardiomyocytes. However, cocultured with simvastatin significantly inhibited the cardiomyocyte [(3)H]leucine uptake induced by angiotensin II in a concentration-dependent manner. Cotreatment with zinc protoporphyrin significantly abolished the suppressive effect of simvastatin on cardiomyocyte [(3)H]leucine uptake. These data suggest that the activation of HO-1/CO pathway may be one of the important mechanisms by which statins inhibit cardiac hypertrophy caused by hypertension.", 
    "125": "This review describes the clinical profile and rationale for the development of a single-pill formulation of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine besylate, a blood pressure-lowering agent with pleiotropic effects, and atorvastatin calcium, a statin with lipid-lowering as well as pleiotropic anti-atherosclerotic properties. Amlodipine and atorvastatin have been demonstrated in numerous clinical trials to be highly effective in lowering blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Furthermore, both amlodipine and atorvastatin have been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in a broad range of patients. The amlodipine/atorvastatin single pill has been shown to improve patients' achievement of national guideline-recommended blood pressure and lipid target levels and exhibits a safety profile consistent with its parent compounds. The combination pill is available in formulations appropriate for administration across therapeutic dose ranges targeted to a wide variety of hypertensive patients with additional risk factors and differing degrees of cardiovascular risk, or with manifest cardiovascular disease. Single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin has the potential to improve the management of hypertensive patients with additional cardiovascular risk factors, especially dyslipidemia, by reducing pill burden and prescription costs. This potential has important implications because hypertensive patients with additional risk factors represent a large proportion of those at risk for cardiovascular events.", 
    "126": "Diabetes is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease. The management of dyslipidemia, a well-recognized and modifiable risk factor among patients with type 2 diabetes, is an important element in the multifactorial approach to prevent coronary heart disease. Diabetic dyslipidemia typically consists of elevated triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and the predominance of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with diabetes are similar to those found in the rest of the population. During the past few years, clinical trials have provided evidence that lipid-lowering therapy has a similar beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. According to current guidelines, the primary lipid target is an LDL-C <100 mg/dL (<70 mg/dL in very high-risk patients) and, to this end, statins are the agents of choice. The appropriate management of dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes, particularly in individuals with low LDL-C, remains controversial. To achieve lipid targets, attention should be directed first toward nonpharmacologic therapeutic interventions to control dyslipidemia, such as diet, exercise, smoking cessation, weight loss, and glycemic control. Statin therapy is recommended for most subjects but, frequently, a combination of lipid-lowering agents is required. A number of combinations are possible, and several factors should be considered to improve the safety of this strategy.",

Rats subjected to embolic MCA occlusion (MCAo) were randomized into control (n = 10) and treatment (n = 9) groups. Four hours after MCAo, a combination of rtPA and atorvastatin (treatment) or saline (control) was administered. MRI measurements were performed on all animals at 2 h, 24 h and 48 h after MCAo. The patency of cerebral microvessels was examined using fluorescent microscopy. MRI images showed complete blockage of the right MCA and a reduction of CBF in the territory supplied by the MCA 2 h after MCAo for all animals. By 48 h after stroke, MRI showed that the decreased lesion size, elevated CBF and increased incidence of recanalization were found in treated rats compared with the control rats. The combination treatment significantly increased microvascular patency (16.3 +/- 5.5% vs. 12.4 +/- 3.5%, of field-of-view) and reduced the infarct volume (23.1 +/- 9.6% vs. 38.8 +/- 13.3%, of hemisphere).

We tested the hypothesis that pravastatin would reduce blood pressure at 3 months and the risk of developing new hypertension over a follow-up period of 5 years. This was a post hoc subgroup analysis of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of pravastatin 40 mg daily vs placebo in 4159 participants with previous myocardial infarction and total plasma cholesterol <240 mg/dl (6.2 mmol/l). The primary outcome was the unadjusted change in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline to 3 months. We also considered systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and pulse pressure. Analysis of covariance was used to calculate the adjusted effect of treatment on change in these outcomes at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postrandomization, after controlling for potential confounders. Logistic regression was used to calculate the adjusted effect of treatment on incident hypertension (blood pressure > or =140/90 in those without known hypertension at baseline). This analysis included 4126/4159 (99.2%) participants for whom blood pressure was measured at baseline and during at least one follow-up visit. Median duration of follow-up was 57.8 months.

    "140": "Pharmacokinetic coadministration experiments with atorvastatin (ATV) and rifampicin (RIF) in rats were performed to investigate the potential involvement of hepatic uptake transporters, Oatps (organic anion-transporting polypeptides), during hepatic drug elimination, as an in vivo extension of our recently published cellular and isolated perfused liver studies. ATV was administered orally (10 mg/kg) and intravenously (2 mg/kg) to rats in the absence and presence of a single intravenous dose of RIF (20 mg/kg), and pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between control and RIF-treatment groups. RIF markedly increased the plasma concentrations of ATV and its metabolites when ATV was administered orally. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) for ATV also increased significantly after intravenous dosing of ATV with RIF, but the extent was much less than that observed for oral ATV dosing. Significant increases in plasma levels were observed for both metabolites as well. The 7-fold higher AUC ratio of metabolites to parent drug following oral versus intravenous ATV dosing suggests that ATV undergoes extensive gut metabolism. Both hepatic and intestinal metabolism contribute to the low oral bioavailability of ATV in rats. In the presence of RIF, the liver metabolic extraction was significantly reduced, most likely because of RIF's inhibition on Oatp-mediated uptake, which leads to reduced hepatic amounts of parent drug for subsequent metabolism. Gut extraction was also significantly reduced, but we were unable to elucidate the mechanism of this effect because intravenous RIF caused gut changes in availability. These studies reinforce our hypothesis that hepatic uptake is a major contributor to the elimination of ATV and its metabolites in vivo.", 
    "141": "Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are both implicated in the pathogenesis of in-stent restenosis. This study evaluated the hypothesis that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin inhibits TGF-beta1 induced TSP-1 expression via inhibition of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) and may therefore have anti-restenosis potential. Fluvastatin significantly reduced TSP-1 mRNA and protein expression in HCASMC in a concentration-dependent manner with a significant reduction in expression observed after treatment with 0.25 microM fluvastatin. TGF-beta1 (5 ng/ml) induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and induced TSP-1 mRNA and protein expression in HCASMC. Fluvastatin abolished TGF-beta1-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and TGF-beta1-induced TSP-1 expression. Blockade of the p38 MAPK pathway with the upstream inhibitor SB-203580 also abolished TGF-beta1-induced TSP-1 expression. We conclude that fluvastatin decreases expression of TSP-1 and abolishes the ability of TGF-beta1 to induce TSP-1 expression in HCASMC; this may be achieved by preventing signalling through the p38 MAPK pathway. Targeted delivery of fluvastatin may therefore be a useful therapeutic objective for prevention of the intimal hyperplasia associated with in-stent restenosis.", 
    "142": "Statins are the most frequently used lipid-lowering drugs in all cardiovascular disease. It has been postulated that also patients with renal failure and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may benefit from statin therapy. Moreover, statins may exhibit additional inhibitory effects on the atherogenesis, such as a modulation of the immune system as triggered by oxidatively modified LDL and a reduction of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Statins reduce inflammation, cell proliferation, which leads to a reduction in cellular damage. Those effects are probably independent of cholesterol levels. Limited data suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) may slow loss of renal function in individuals with chronic renal insufficiency. It is concluded on the basis of the CARE trial that pravastatin may slow renal function loss in individuals with moderate to severe kidney disease, especially those with proteinuria. Similar data were obtained from recently published HPS trial with simvastatin. These findings require confirmation by a large randomized trial conducted specifically in people with chronic renal insufficiency. Statins vary in their pharmacological profiles, leading to distinct levels of systemic exposure and capacities to penetrate skeletal myocytes. Pharmacokinetic interactions with certain agents increase the likelihood of statin-induced myopathy and, in exceedingly rare instances, potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and renal failure, therefore two statins have been suggested for renal failure patients. These are the ones that are not metabolised by the cytochrome P450 3A4 system--fluvastatin and pravastatin.

We show in this study that both atorvastatin and simvastatin induced proinflammatory responses in mitogen-activated PBMCs by increasing the number of T cells secreting IFN-gamma. This is abolished by the presence of mevalonate, suggesting that statins act specifically by blocking the mevalonate pathway for cholesterol synthesis to promote the proinflammatory response. Both statins at low concentrations induced a dose-dependent increase in the number of IFN-gamma-secreting T cells in mitogen-activated PBMCs, whereas at higher concentrations the effect was abolished. The proinflammatory effect of statins was not seen in purified T cells per se activated with mitogen. However, conditioned medium derived from statin-treated PBMCs enhanced the number of IFN-gamma-secreting cells in activated purified T cells. This effect was not blocked by mevalonate, but was abolished by neutralizing Abs to IL-18 and IL-12. Similarly, the up-regulation of IFN-gamma-secreting T cells in PBMCs costimulated with statins and mitogens was blocked by the neutralizing anti-IL-18 and anti-IL-12. We showed that simvastatin stimulates the secretion of IL-18 and IL-1beta in monocytes. Active caspase-1, which is required for the processing and secretion of IL-18 and IL-1beta, was activated in simvastatin-treated monocytes. This was blocked by mevalonate and the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fluoromethylketone. Taken together, the proinflammatory response mediated by statins in activated PBMCs is mediated mainly via the activation of caspase-1 and IL-18 secretion in the monocytes and to a lesser extent by IL-12.",

Group A (n=15): de novo monotherapy with 10 mg/day ezetimibe; Group B (n=15): 10 mg/day ezetimibe as an add-on to chronic simvastatin therapy with 20 mg/day; Group C (n=15): dose escalation from chronic 10 to 40 mg/day atorvastatin; and Group D (n=15): de novo monotherapy with 40 mg/day atorvastatin. After 4 weeks of therapy, LDL cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in all four groups. Neither ezetimibe monotherapy (Group A) nor ezetimibe combined with 20 mg simvastatin (Group B) was associated with an increase in ACH-mediated FBF responses after 4 weeks. In contrast, dose escalation of atorvastatin from 10 to 40 mg/day (Group C) or de novo therapy with 40 mg atorvastatin/day (Group D) was associated with a significant increase in ACH-mediated FBF responses (P<0.013).", 
    "150": "Thus, both statins and ezetimibe effectively lower LDL-levels within 4 weeks of therapy. However, only statin therapy is associated with improved endothelial vasodilator function, disclosing the relevance of pleiotropic effects of statins during short-term treatment of patients with CAD.", 
    "151": "The metabolic syndrome appears to affect a significant proportion of the population and is associated with increased risk for development of cardiovascular disease as well as of type-2 diabetes. No single treatment for the metabolic syndrome as a whole yet exists. While the primary management of patients with the metabolic syndrome involves healthy lifestyle promotion, the atherogenic dyslipidemia is a primary target for cardiovascular disease risk reduction in these patients. Statin therapy provides effective reduction of LDL-cholesterol, which represents the primary therapeutic goal of lipid-lowering therapy in patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. Fibrates in turn are effective in normalizing lipid levels (mainly triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol) in patients with the metabolic syndrome and may improve insulin resistance. Whereas statins remain the drug of choice for patients who need to achieve the LDL-cholesterol goal, fibrate therapy may represent an alternative for those with low HDL-cholesterol and high triglyceride levels. The simultaneous use of fibrates could be indicated in patients whose LDL-cholesterol is controlled by statin therapy but whose HDL-cholesterol and/or triglycerides are still inappropriate. Such a combination, however, needs careful monitoring due to the potential hazard of adverse drug interactions. Nicotinic acid and ezetimibe may be useful agents for therapy, particularly when combined with statins. A number of emerging therapies offer potential as future options for the pharmacological treatment of metabolic syndrome.", 
    "152": "The aim of the present work was to establish conditions for paraoxonase 3 (PON3) activity determination in human blood serum with simvastatin (SV) as a substrate. The activity of PON3 is considered as a good early predictor of susceptibility to premature atherosclerosis as well as of statin therapy effectiveness. The method used quantifies the SV and beta,delta-dihydroxyacid simvastatin (SVA) liberated from SV after incubation with blood serum, followed by deproteinization of the reaction mixture. Separation of SV and SVA was performed on an LC(18) column by isocratic elution with acetonitrile-K-phosphate buffer of pH 4.5 (v/v, 70:30) as a mobile phase at flow rate of 1.5 ml min(-1). Detection based on ultraviolet absorption at a wavelength of 239 nm was reliable for the simultaneous assay of SV and SVA. The applied method was sufficiently sensitive, precise and accurate for determination of low simvastatin lactone hydrolase (statinase) activity in blood serum of children (1.97-6.86 pmol min(-1) ml(-1)). The method is characterized by good linearity over the measurement range of 0.5-6 microg ml(-1) (1.194-14.3 nmol ml(-1)). Limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for SV were 3.1 and 10.4 ng ml(-1), respectively. In case of SVA, LOD and LOQ were 4.7 and 14.44 ng ml(-) for a 20 microl sample, respectively. Precision and accuracy of PON3 statinase activity determination in human blood serum with SV as substrate were satisfactory and acceptable for bioanalytical methods.", 
    "153": "Human MCT4 (SLC16A3) is responsible for the efflux of L-lactic acid from skeletal muscle cells and is essential for muscle homeostasis. However, the effects of monocarboxylate drugs, such as statins on the MCT4-mediated transport of L-lactic acid have not been elucidated. Inhibition of L-lactic acid transport mediated by MCT4 might to lead to collapse of muscle homeostasis. The aim of this study was to establish an MCT4 transfected cell line and to clarify the transport mechanism of L-lactic acid and the effects of statins on this transport system. Results of Western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry studies indicated that the expression of CD147 and MCT4-FLAG protein were observed and was displayed clear plasma membrane localization in CD147 and MCT4-FLAG co-transfected cell line (cm cells). Uptake of L-lactic acid in cm cells was significantly greater than that in cells transfected with a vector alone. L-lactic acid uptake was concentration-dependent with a K(m) value of 28.43+/-3.87 mM. The results of a previous study showing a K(m) value of 28.5 mM in hMCT4-expressed oocytes. Lipophilic statins significantly inhibited [(14)C] L-lactic acid uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the inhibitory effects of hydrophilic statins were very weak.", 
    "154": "Beneficial cardiovascular effects of statins, the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, are particularly assigned to the modulation of inflammation. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) are listed among the crucial protective, anti-inflammatory genes in the vasculature. Here we show that atorvastatin at pharmacologically relevant concentration (0.1 microM) enhanced the expression of eNOS in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Moreover, atorvastatin prevented hypoxia-induced decrease in eNOS expression. However, in the same cells atorvastatin was ineffective in modulation of HO-1 protein level. Therefore, we suggest that the protective effect of statins at their pharmacological concentrations is not mediated by enhancement of HO-1 activity, but may involve eNOS.", 
    "155": "Endpoint studies have been performed with fibrates in coronary heart disease since 1971. The results have been confusing - starting with initial benefits in small studies, but contradicted by either minimal benefits in the Coronary Drug Project or adverse noncardiovascular (non-CV) effects in the World Health Organization Clofibrate Study. Fibrates returned for patients with low HDL-C and low LDL-C after a 25% event reduction were seen in the Veterans Affairs HDL Intervention Trial. The greater prominence ascribed to the lipid triad of the metabolic syndrome and the increasing prevalence of diabetes increased the topicality of fibrates given their main action of converting small dense to light buoyant LDL. The Fenofibrate Intervention in Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) Study has carried on the tradition. Fenofibrate therapy in 9795 patients comprising a mixed low-risk primary and a medium-risk secondary prevention cohort resulted in an 11% reduction in coronary events (p = 0.16), a similar but significant reduction in CV events (p = 0.04; number needed to treat = 70). The benefits were concentrated in primary prevention and on nonfatal myocardial events, but the study was confounded by asymmetrical statin drop-in due to the LDL-C-lowering effect of fenofibrate. Safety was generally good, including in combination with statins, but old concerns about sudden death, pancreatitis and venous thrombosis returned. Unexpected benefits were seen with fenofibrate on microvascular endpoints including microalbuminuria and retinopathy. Fenofibrate is a reasonable second-line therapy for dyslipidaemia in diabetes and safe in combination therapy. Its benefits on microvascular disease and in combination therapy require further confirmation.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of fluvastatin (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase inhibitor) on heterotopic ossification (HO) induced by HeLa cells. 2. C57Bl/6 mice were injected with 3 x 10(6) HeLa cells into right thigh muscles. Mice in the experimental group received fluvastatin 1.2 mg/kg per day for 17 consecutive days, while mice in the control group received placebo. Intact mice served as an additional control. Seventeen days post-HeLa cell grafting, blood samples were collected to measure total serum cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol and alkaline phosphatase (AP). 3. In all animals injected with HeLa cells, the mass of mineral deposited in the induced ossicle was established after hydrolysis of soft tissues surrounding the induced ossicles. In fluvastatin-treated mice, the mass of mineral deposited in heterotopically induced ossicles was significantly increased, when compared to mice receiving placebo. This was followed by a significant decrease of TG concentration; whereas the levels of serum AP were not significantly affected. 4. These results indicate that administration of statins may affect heterotopic ossification. This may also have clinical implication, because patients predisposed to HO and receiving statins during hypocholesterolemic treatment, may be at even greater risk of HO.",

Atorvastatin (Ato), an HMG-Co-enzyme-A reductase inhibitor has been reported to enhance availability of NO. The aim of the study was to assess whether pretreatment with Ato would prevent the development of ACTH-induced hypertension and whether established ACTH-induced hypertension could be reversed with subsequent administration of Ato in rats. 2. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 60) were treated with Ato (30 mg/kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days. ACTH (0.2 mg/kg per day s.c) or saline was started 4 days after Ato treatment or non-treated rats and continued for 11-13 days (prevention study). In the reversal study, Ato was given on day 8 of ACTH/Saline treatment for 5 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail cuff method. 3. Adrenocorticotropic hormone treatment increased SBP (110 +/- 2-136 +/- 2 mmHg, P < 0.001) and aortic superoxide production (P < 0.001). Ato alone did not alter SBP, but Ato pretreatment prevented ACTH-induced hypertension compared with that in rats treated with ACTH alone (118 +/- 2 and 136 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively, P cent < 0.01). Ato partially reversed ACTH-induced hypertension (124 +/- 3 and 136 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively, P cent < 0.05). Plasma nitrate/nitrite (NOx) was decreased in ACTH-treated rats compared with saline treated rats (6.6 +/- 0.4 saline and 4.5 +/- 0.5 micromol/L ACTH, P < 0.001). Atorvastatin affected neither plasma NOx nor aortic superoxide production. 4. Atorvastatin prevented and partially reversed ACTH-induced hypertension in the rat.",

The National Cholesterol Education Program has recently updated the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines and called for more intensive lipid lowering treatment, especially in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease. A statin and fibrate combination is a possible approach, moreover, niacin, particularly in combination with statins, might have a successful comeback. However, despite the existence of evidence-based treatment guidelines and effective antilipemic medications, recommended cardiovascular risk reduction rarely is achieved.

    "170": "Increased angiotensin II (Ang II) sensitivity predisposes to hypertension and plaque instability. Raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) may increase Ang II sensitivity, but evidence in humans for this effect of LDL-c is limited. In 28, healthy, nonsmoking subjects, aged 30+/-8 years, with familial hypercholesterolemia, we determined the difference in infusion rate of Ang II and norepinephrine required to increase systolic blood pressure by 20 mm Hg (Pd-20) after 4 weeks of placebo and fluvastatin 80 mg daily in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Before infusions were started, fasting blood samples were taken to measure lipids. After 4 weeks of placebo, the mean LDL-c concentration was 6.3+/-1.4 mmol/L. The average decrease of LDL-c was 1.7+/-0.7 mmol/L after 4 weeks of fluvastatin (P<0.001). The mean Pd-20 for Ang II increased by 1.28 ng/kg per minute (95% CI, 2.05 to 0.50; P=0.002) on fluvastatin, corresponding with a 26% decrease in Ang II sensitivity. Ang II sensitivity, however, remained increased compared with normocholesterolemic controls. The Pd-20 values for norepinephrine were unaffected by fluvastatin. The present study in healthy, young subjects with isolated hypercholesterolemia shows an increased sensitivity to Ang II that partly can be restored by LDL-c-lowering therapy. These findings indicate that LDL-c levels directly influence Ang II sensitivity.", 
    "171": "Preclinical and clinical studies have provided evidence that aspirin, celecoxib, (cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor), and statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors) inhibit colon carcinogenesis. Chronic use of high doses of these agents may induce side effects in ostensibly normal individuals. Combining low doses of agents may be an effective way to increase their efficacy and minimize toxicity. We assessed the efficacy of atorvastatin (lipitor), celecoxib, and aspirin, given individually at high dose levels and in combination at lower doses against azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis, in male F 344 rats. One day after the last azoxymethane treatment (15 mg/kg body weight, s.c., once weekly for 2 weeks), groups of male F 344 rats were fed the AIN-76A diet or AIN-76A diet containing 150 ppm atorvastatin, 600 ppm celecoxib, and 400 ppm aspirin, 100 ppm atorvastatin + 300 ppm celecoxib, and 100 ppm atorvastatin + 200 ppm aspirin. Rats were killed 42 weeks later, and colon tumors were processed histopathologically and analyzed for cell proliferation and apoptosis immunohistochemically. Administration of these agents individually and in combination significantly suppressed the incidence and multiplicity of colon adenocarcinomas. Low doses of these agents in combination inhibited colon carcinogenesis more effectively than when they were given individually at higher doses. Inhibition of colon carcinogenesis by these agents is associated with the inhibition of cell proliferation and increase in apoptosis in colon tumors. These observations are of clinical significance because this can pave the way for the use of combinations of these agents in small doses against colon cancer.",

It is apparent that the active treatment of certain of these cardiovascular disease risk factors is accompanied by a reduced risk for cognitive impairment. Patients with hypertension who are treated experience fewer cardiovascular disease events as well as less cognitive impairment than similar untreated patients. Patients who exercise may present with less cognitive impairment, and obesity may increase the risk for cognitive impairment. Lipid abnormalities and genetic markers are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment. Autopsy studies have demonstrated a correlation between elevated levels of cholesterol and amyloid deposition in the brain. Research has demonstrated a relation between atherosclerotic obstruction lesions in the circle of Willis and dementia. Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment. A number of nonpharmacologic factors have a role in reducing the risk for cognitive impairment. Antioxidants, fatty acids, and micronutrients may have a role, and diets rich in fruits and vegetables and other dietary approaches may improve the outlook for patients considered at risk for cognitive impairment.",

The addition of the bile acid sequestrants, such as colesevelam hydrochloride (HCl), to statins further reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. However, the effects of approved cholesterol-lowering bile acid sequestrants on hs-CRP have not previously been reported. Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, 6-week clinical trials of similar design investigated the efficacy of adding colesevelam HCl to stable simvastatin, atorvastatin, or pravastatin treatment in 204 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. The primary end point was the mean percent change in the LDL cholesterol levels. Secondary end points included the effects on other lipid parameters and hs-CRP levels. A pooled analysis showed that adding colesevelam HCl to statin therapy significantly lowered LDL cholesterol levels (21 mg/dl or 16% mean reduction from baseline, p = 0.0013, and 11 mg/dl or 9% mean reduction compared with placebo, p = 0.0003). Four times as many patients receiving colesevelam HCl plus a statin achieved a LDL cholesterol target of <100 mg/dl compared with patients receiving a statin plus placebo (39% vs 10%, respectively, p <0.0001). The incidence of mild gastrointestinal adverse effects was slightly higher in the colesevelam HCl plus statin group than in the placebo plus statin group. Finally, the differences in the change in hs-CRP levels with colesevelam HCl plus statin therapy were significant compared with the changes with placebo plus statin (median change -23%, p = 0.0069). In conclusion, this is the first report suggesting that an approved cholesterol-lowering bile acid sequestrant, specifically colesevelam HCl, decreases hs-CRP levels when added to statin therapy."
