    "0": "Sixteen subjects with familial hypercholesterolaemia were randomly assigned to treatment with simvastatin 20-40 mg/day (an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase) or with bezafibrate 600 mg/day (a clofibrate analogue) for 12 weeks. Both drugs produced significant reductions in serum and LDL cholesterol; mean percentage fall -30.5% and -38.1% (simvastatin) and -17.8% and -20.6% (bezafibrate), respectively. Both drugs also caused a decrease in VLDL cholesterol, while only bezafibrate decreased the serum and VLDL triglyceride levels and increased HDL cholesterol and serum apolipoprotein A-I and A-II levels. Serum apolipoprotein B fell by 33.3% (simvastatin) and 15.7% (bezafibrate). Simvastatin and bezafibrate produced significant increases in the mean fractional esterification rate of LCAT, by +124.1% and +20.6%, respectively. Thus simvastatin was clearly more effective than bezafibrate in lowering LDL by enhancing its turnover, but bezafibrate had specific effects on VLDL and HDL that might be favourable in combined treatment regimens.", 
    "1": "A short-term (12 h) infusion with mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, significantly lowered plasma cholesterol concentration in rats. After 7 days of continuous treatment hypocholesterolaemia disappeared, and this was coupled with a notable increase in the average volume of hepatocytes. Liver-cell hypertrophy was associated with a striking proliferation of the membranes of both rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, as well as with a tremendous increase in the number of peroxisomes. These structural changes are interpreted as the morphologic counterpart of the compensatory response of rat liver to the prolonged inhibitory effect of mevinolin on cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "2": "The structure of NADP implies, in addition to the hydrogen transfer potential, two activated groups: 2'-phospho AMP and 2'-phospho ADP-ribose. Recent findings demonstrate that both can be used to modify covalently eukaryotic proteins. 2'-Phospho adenylylation appears to be an important route of post-translational modification involving various acceptor polypeptides in different subcellular compartments of rat liver. The true substrate of the transferases involved, however, is free 2'-phospho ADP-ribose derived from NADP by the action of NADP glycohydrolase, conferring a new function to the glycohydrolase beyond its purely catabolic action. The second type of modification, 2'-phospho ADP-ribosylation, was detected as an activity of the arginine specific ADP-ribosyl transferase from erythrocytes (Moss and Vaughan, 1978) which in the presence of H1 used NADP in preference to NAD. These findings show that both pyridine nucleotides represent versatile, multifunctional co-factors, serving as hydrogen-transferring as well as group-transferring co-enzymes.", 
    "3": "Lovastatin and simvastatin are the 2 best-known members of the class of hypolipidaemic agents known as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Clinical experience with lovastatin includes over 5000 patients, 700 of whom have been treated for 2 years or more, and experience with simvastatin includes over 3500 patients, of whom 350 have been treated for 18 months or more. Lovastatin has been marketed in the United States for over 6 months. Both agents show substantial clinical efficacy, with reductions in total cholesterol of over 30% and in LDL-cholesterol of 40% in clinical studies. Modest increases in HDL-cholesterol levels of about 10% are also reported. Clinical tolerability of both agents has been good, with fewer than 3% of patients withdrawn from treatment because of clinical adverse experiences. Ophthalmological examinations in over 1100 patients treated with one or the other agent have revealed no evidence of significant short term (up to 2 years) cataractogenic potential. One to 2% of patients have elevations of serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal. These episodes are asymptomatic and reversible when therapy is discontinued. Minor elevations of creatine kinase levels are reported in about 5% of patients. Myopathy, associated in some cases with myoglobinuria, and in 2 cases with transient renal failure, has been rarely reported with lovastatin, especially in patients concomitantly treated with cyclosporin, gemfibrozil or niacin. Lovastatin and simvastatin are both effective and well-tolerated agents for lowering elevated levels of serum cholesterol. As wider use confirms their safety profile, they will gain increasing importance in the therapeutic approach to hypercholesterolaemia and its consequences.", 
    "4": "Lovastatin (MK-803, mevinolin) and simvastatin (MK-733, synvinolin), 2 highly potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been heralded as breakthrough therapy for the treatment of atherosclerotic disease. This paper discusses the biochemical attributes of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, their structures and inhibitory properties in a variety of biological systems and presents the rationale for their therapeutic use. Not only do lovastatin and simvastatin potently inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis; they also can result in the induction of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, thus increasing the catabolism of LDL-cholesterol. Lovastatin and simvastatin are the first HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to receive regulatory agency approval for marketed use. Their safety profiles are reviewed and 2 aspects of this evaluation are stressed. First, the objective in the clinical use of these inhibitors is to normalise plasma cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolaemic individuals. This contrasts with the profound reductions in cholesterol obtained when normocholesterolaemic animals are treated by the high doses of these drugs required for toxicological assessment. Second, both lovastatin and simvastatin are administered as prodrugs in their lactone forms. As lactones, they readily undergo first-pass metabolism, hepatic sequestration and hydrolysis to the active form. Consequently, lovastatin and simvastatin achieve lower plasma drug levels than do other HMG CoA reductase inhibitors in clinical development. Low plasma levels have been established as an important determinant of safety in the use of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors in both animal and human studies.", 
    "5": "The rationale for drug treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia is that sustained reductions in the plasma concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins will retard the development of atherosclerosis. Drug therapy should be initiated only after the exclusion of secondary factors and after an adequate trial of dietary therapy has failed to lower plasma cholesterol to a satisfactory level. The bile-acid sequestrants (cholestyramine and colestipol), nicotinic acid, and lovastatin are the most effective drugs for use in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia; these agents reduce total and LDL cholesterol concentrations by 15-35%. For patients with high concentrations of LDL cholesterol who concurrently have hypertriglyceridemia, nicotinic acid is the drug of choice, and bile-acid sequestrants are contraindicated. Combined therapy with drugs that have different mechanisms of action can be effectively utilized in the treatment of patients with severe hypercholesterolemia; combinations involving lovastatin, nicotinic acid, and bile-acid sequestrants are the most effective.", 
    "6": "A new class of drugs, which inhibit de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, significantly reduces the blood cholesterol concentrations in hypercholesterolemic patients. Four separate inhibitors have lowered plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in humans by 20% to 40%: mevastatin (Compactin), lovastatin (mevinolin), pravastatin (CS-514, Eptastatin, and SQ 31000), and simvastatin (Synvinolin, MK-733). In addition to lowering total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, the plasma concentration of the potentially atherogenic B apolipoprotein is also reduced by 20% to 40%. The reduction in the levels of circulating atherogenic lipoprotein particles occurs as a result of decreased synthesis and enhanced removal of LDLs by the LDL receptor pathway in hepatocytes. Moreover, the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which are inversely related to atherosclerosis, increase in concentration with treatment by these drugs. If the short-term safety of these drugs extends to ongoing long-term studies and if cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are affected by their use, this class of hypolipidemic agent will markedly facilitate the effective treatment of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "7": "A beta-lactone isolated from Scopulariopsis sp. shows a potent inhibition of cholesterogenesis. The structure of this beta-lactone, termed F-244, is 3,5,7-trimethyl-12-hydroxy-13-hydroxymethyl-2,4-tetradecadiendioic acid 12,14-lactone. The inhibition site of F-244 in cholesterol synthesis was studied. The growth of Vero cells was inhibited at 6.25-12.5 micrograms/ml of F-244. The inhibition of growth was overcome by the addition of mevalonate to the culture medium, but not by the addition of acetate. In a rat liver enzyme system, the incorporations of [14C]acetate and [14C]acetyl-CoA into digitonin-precipitable sterol were 50% inhibited by 0.58 microgram/ml of F-244. The incorporation of [14C]mevalonate was not affected. Studies on the effects of F-244 on the three enzymes involved in mevalonate biosynthesis demonstrated that the drug specifically inhibits HMG-CoA synthase with IC50 value of 0.065 microgram/ml. The effect of analogs of F-244 on HMG-CoA synthase was also investigated.", 
    "8": "Cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD) is characterized by the deficient activity of lysosomal cholesteryl ester (CE) hydrolase, accumulation of LDL-derived CE in lysosomes, and hyperlipidemia. We studied the kinetics of VLDL and LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB), using 125I-VLDL and 131I-LDL, in a 9-yr-old female with CESD and elevated total cholesterol (TC) (271.0 +/- 4.4 mg/dl), triglyceride (TG) (150.0 +/- 7.8 mg/dl), and LDL cholesterol (184.7 +/- 3.4 mg/dl). These studies demonstrated a markedly elevated production rate (PR) of apoB, primarily in LDL, with normal fractional catabolism of apoB in VLDL and LDL. Urine mevalonate levels were elevated, indicative of increased synthesis of endogenous cholesterol. Treatment with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, resulted in significant reductions in TC (196.8 +/- 7.9 mg/dl), TG (100.8 +/- 20.6 mg/dl), and LDL cholesterol (102.0 +/- 10.9 mg/dl). Therapy reduced VLDL apoB PR (5.2 vs. 12.2 mg/kg per d pretreatment) and LDL apoB PR (12.7 vs. 24.2 mg/kg per d pretreatment). Urine mevalonate levels also decreased during therapy. These results indicate that, in CESD, the inability to release free cholesterol from lysosomal CE resulted in elevated synthesis of endogenous cholesterol and increased production of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Lovastatin reduced both the rate of cholesterol synthesis and the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins.", 
    "9": "Lovastatin (Mevinolin), a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, has been used effectively as a hypocholesterolemic agent in man. As an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, a potentially serious side effect of therapy with this drug is interference with adrenocortical function. The effect of lovastatin on adrenal function was evaluated in a 6-month, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study involving 24 type II hyperlipoproteinemic patients. Despite significant lowering of total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by lovastatin, no statistically or clinically significant differences were seen in free cortisol excretion or in plasma cortisol response to intravenous ACTH infusion between baseline, placebo, and lovastatin-treated patients. We conclude that lovastatin does not adversely affect adrenocortical reserve in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or non-FH type II hyperlipoproteinemia.", 
    "10": "Primary cultures of newborn rat cerebrum, which are composed of glial cells (principally astroglia), were used for examining the relationship between dolichol-linked glycoprotein synthesis and DNA synthesis in developing cerebral glia. The cells were synchronized by reducing the content of fetal calf serum in the culture medium from 10 to 0.1% (vol/vol) for 48 h between days 4 and 6 in culture. Reversal of the quiescent state by return of the cultures to 10% serum causes a marked increase in DNA synthesis 12-24 h later. A sharp increase in glycoprotein synthesis (incorporation of [3H]mannose) occurred in the first 12 h after serum repletion, preceding the increase in DNA synthesis. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of the dolichol-linked pathway to glycoprotein synthesis at the first committed step in oligosaccharide formation, promptly and completely prevented the increase in glycoprotein synthesis and, in addition, the subsequent increase in DNA synthesis. The effects of tunicamycin on glycoprotein and DNA syntheses were reversible, and no comparable effect on total protein synthesis was observed. When tunicamycin was added only during a temporally circumscribed period in G1, i.e., from 3 to 9 h after serum repletion, the increase in DNA synthesis between 12 and 24 h after repletion was still markedly inhibited, i.e., to approximately 45% of the value in untreated cultures. The data thus show that there is a requirement for dolichol-linked glycoprotein synthesis for the subsequent occurrence of DNA synthesis and that this requirement is expressed late in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.",

Of those patients receiving 40 mg twice a day, 89% had a fall in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of at least 20%, and 61% had a fall of at least 40%.

    "25": "It has been postulated that low density lipoprotein (LDL) becomes fully atherogenic only if it first undergoes oxidative modification. The oxidatively modified form, but not native LDL, is recognized by the acetyl-LDL or \"scavenger\" receptor and could, therefore, be taken up rapidly by tissue macrophages to generate the fatty-streak lesion of atherosclerosis. However, there is thus far very little direct evidence for oxidative modification in vivo. The studies reported here take advantage of the fact that probucol is an effective antioxidant transported in lipoproteins, including LDL, and blocks the oxidative modification of LDL in vitro. We now show that the rate of degradation of LDL in the macrophage-rich fatty-streak lesions of the LDL receptor-deficient rabbit treated with probucol (1% by weight in the diet) is reduced to about one-half of that in the lesions of receptor-deficient rabbits not given probucol (but matched for plasma cholesterol levels). In contrast, the rates of degradation in the nonlesioned areas of the aorta were no different in probucol-treated and control animals. Most of the LDL degradation in fatty-streak lesions takes place in macrophages, whereas in nonlesioned aorta, which contains very few macrophages, the degradation is almost exclusively in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Thus, the results are compatible with the postulate that the native LDL taken up and degraded by foam cells in the developing fatty-streak lesions was in part first converted to a form recognized by the scavenger receptor (by oxidative or analogous modification). Finally, and most importantly, we show that treatment with probucol significantly reduced the rate of development of fatty-streak lesions even though plasma cholesterol levels were no lower than lovastatin-treated (control) rabbits.", 
    "26": "A beta-lactone isolated from Fusarium sp. has been shown to be a potent specific inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase [(S)-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA acetoacetyl-CoA-lyase (CoA-acetylating), EC, 4.1.3.5] from rat liver. The structure of this beta-lactone, termed L-659,699, is (E,E)-11-[3-(hydroxy-methyl)-4-oxo-2-oxytanyl]-3,5,7-trimethyl-2,4 - undecadienenoic acid. A partially purified preparation of cytoplasmic HMG-CoA synthase from rat liver was inhibited by L-659,699 with an IC50 of 0.12 microM. The enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, beta-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase, and fatty acid synthase were not inhibited to any extent by this compound. In cultured Hep G2 cells, the compound inhibited the incorporation of [14C]acetate into sterols with an IC50 of 6 microM, while incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into sterols in these cells was not affected. The activity of HMG-CoA reductase in the cultured Hep G2 cells was induced in a dose-dependent manner by incubation with L-659,699. A 37-fold increase in reductase was observed after a 24-hr incubation with 62 microM L-659,699. The effect of a number of analogs of L-659,699 on HMG-CoA synthase is also discussed.", 
    "27": "We have studied the relationship between differentiation capacity, plasma membrane composition, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression of normal keratinocytes in vitro. The plasma membrane composition of the cells was modulated experimentally by cholesterol depletion, using specific inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevinolin. Exposure of the cells towards these inhibitors resulted in a drastic decrease of cholesterol biosynthesis, as determined from 14C-acetate incorporation into the various lipid fractions. This effect on cholesterol biosynthesis was reflected by changes in plasma membrane composition, as determined by lipid analysis of isolated plasma membrane fractions, these resulting in a decreased cholesterol-phospholipid ratio. The experimental modulation of plasma membrane composition by 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevinolin were accompanied by a decreased cornified envelope formation and by high expression of EGF binding sites. These phenomena were more pronounced in cells induced to differentiate by exposure of cells grown under low Ca2+ to normal Ca2+ concentrations, as compared to cells grown persistently under low Ca2+ concentrations. These results suggest a close correlation between plasma membrane composition, differentiation capacity, and EGF receptor expression.", 
    "28": "Hypercholesterolemia with increased plasma concentrations of low density lipoproteins (LDL) is a major risk factor for the premature development of coronary atherosclerosis in humans and is best exemplified by patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The recent development of several specific competitive inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, HMG CoA reductase) has opened up an important new avenue of therapy for patients with hypercholesterolemia who are not responsive to dietary treatment alone. Three drugs, lovastatin (mevinolin), simvastatin (synvinolin) and pravastatin (CS 514), are currently undergoing clinical trials in North America and Europe; the former has recently been approved for general use. Experience with lovastatin and simvastatin in the treatment of patients with primary and secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia is reviewed. The relative potency of simvastatin appears to be greater than that of lovastatin and pravastatin but, with each drug, decreases in the plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol of 30% to 50% can be achieved. The hypocholesterolemic effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can be potentiated by combination therapy with other approved lipid-lowering medications including the bile acid sequestrants and nicotinic acid. If long-term safety can be satisfactorily established, specific inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase represent a major advance in the therapy of hypercholesterolemia and afford the potential to reduce substantially the high incidence of premature atherosclerosis that occurs in patients with persistent hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "29": "Mutants resistant to compactin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, have been previously isolated from the Chinese hamster V79 cell line. Two compactin-resistant mutants, MF-1 and MF-2, show altered responses to human low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Accumulation of fluorescent-labeled LDL was much reduced. Ligand blotting showed LDL receptor activity in MF-1 and MF-2 cells of about one half to one third that of V79. Internalization and degradation of LDL in MF-1 or MF-2 cells were about one tenth those in V79 cells, suggesting that the LDL binding as well as the LDL internalization of the compactin-resistant clones was altered. Down-regulation of LDL receptor activity as well as hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase was observed in V79 cells treated with LDL, while there appeared to be much less down-regulation in MF-1 and MF-2 cells. Using anti-LDL receptor antibody, MF-1 and MF-2 cells were found to produce smaller-sized mature forms of LDL receptor: the molecular mass of the mutant LDL receptor was 3-5 kDa smaller than that of the parental LDL receptor. Altered O-linked oligosaccharides or amino acid sequence might account for the decreased molecular mass and aberrant properties of the LDL receptor in MF-1 and MF-2.", 
    "30": "In a previous publication (Saucier, S.E., A.A., Taylor, F.R., Spencer, T.A., Phirwa, S., and Gayen, A.K., J. Biol. Chem. (1985) 260, 14571-14579), we demonstrated that cultured Chinese hamster lung (Dede) cells contain 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol in cellular concentrations within the range required to repress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. In this paper, we show that the addition to the culture medium of a concentration of mevalonate high enough to repress the reductase by 90% resulted in the appearance of two new regulatory oxysterols. The two new sterols are believed to be 32-oxolanosterol and 32-hydroxylanosterol on the basis of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) retention times and mass spectrometric and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic data and by NaBH4 reduction of the putative aldehyde to material which had the HPLC retention time of the putative alcohol. The cellular concentrations of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol were not significantly changed by the presence of mevalonate. However, there was approximately a 30% increase in total HMG-CoA reductase repressor units which can be ascribed to the 32-oxolanosterol and 32-hydroxylanosterol, where 1 unit equals the repressor activity of 1 ng of 25-hydroxycholesterol. These results support the idea that the level of HMG-CoA reductase activity in growing cell cultures is determined by intracellular oxysterol metabolites and that relatively small changes in their numbers or concentrations can alter the level of HMG-CoA reductase activity.", 
    "31": "The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was characterized in cockroach corpora allata which produce insect juvenile hormone III (methyl-(10R)10,11-epoxy-3,7,11-tri-methyl-2E,6E-dodecadienoate ). HMG-CoA reductase is a microsomal enzyme dependent on NADPH and dithiothreitol (or glutathione) for activity. The enzyme selectively reduced (3S)-HMG-CoA to (3R)-mevalonate with an apparent KM of 7.6 microM. Mevinolin was a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase with a KI of 2.4 nM. No evidence for a modulation of enzyme activity by phosphorylation was obtained. Levels of HMG-CoA reductase were not altered after incubation of the corpora allata with either mevinolin (to decrease isoprenoid flux) or with mevalonate or farnesol (to increase isoprenoid flux). Split pairs of corpora allata were used to compare JH III synthetic activity with HMG-CoA reductase activity during the cycle of JH III synthesis that controls vitellogenesis and oocyte growth in adult females. Both activities changed over 10-fold and peaked on day 5 after emergence/mating, but JH III synthesis did not parallel HMG-CoA reductase activity precisely thereafter. The half-life of HMG-CoA reductase measured in the presence of cycloheximide was significantly different between low and high activity glands and was not related to the half-life of JH III synthesis. The results suggest that HMG-CoA reductase should not be considered 'the rate-limiting enzyme' in juvenile hormone synthesis by Diploptera punctata corpora allata.", 
    "32": "The full experimental details for the total synthesis of (+)-compactin and 19 structural analogues are reported. We have evaluated three classes of analogues as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase: (1) functional and stereoisomeric analogues that possess the full carbon skeleton of compactin or dihydromevinolin, (2) functional analogues in which one carbon of the skeleton has been replaced by oxygen, and (3) analogues in which all of the 3,5-dihydroxyvaleric acid moiety has been omitted. Our most potent inhibitors belong to the first class of analogues. Compounds 42 (5-ketocompactin) and 69 (5-ketodihydromevinolin) are as active as the natural products compactin and dihydromevinolin, respectively (I50 = 1-20 nM). The corresponding enones 37 and 68 are less active, having I50 values 20-30 times larger. Inverting the stereochemistry at C-3 or C-5 or about the hexahydronaphthalene ring of compactin results in the elevation of the I50 to values in the micromolar range, comparable to the KM of the natural substrate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. Class 2 analogues are active in this concentration range also. The synthetic sequence developed for compactin and its analogues includes a new method that permits the selective preparation of either the R or the S epimer at C-3 of the 3,5-dihydroxyvaleric acid moiety. This entails the reaction of anhydride 9 with either (R)- or (S)-1-phenylethanol in the presence of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine and triethylamine. The prochiral recognition is surprisingly high; under optimum conditions, the reaction of 9 with (R)-1-phenylethanol leads to a 15:1 ratio of diesters 17 and 18.", 
    "33": "Addition of hemoglobin, methemoglobin, hemin or hematin in the assay mixture of rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMGCoA) reductase inhibited the activity of the enzyme. The inhibition by hemin was rapid, without any apparent dependence on time of preincubation. At 20 microM hemin, a maximum of about 50% inhibition was obtained in the case of the microsomal enzyme while the solubilized enzyme showed almost 80% inhibition. Dithiothreitol at high concentrations or either of the two substrates of the enzyme (HMGCoA and NADPH) could afford partial protection when added before hemin. The Km for both the substrates increased in the presence of hemin. The inhibition by hemin appeared to be irreversible, the presence of KCN or NaN3 being the only means of preventing the inhibition. Molecular oxygen was required for the inhibition. Oxygen radicals and H2O2, however, did not seem to be involved. This offered a clue that an oxidation reaction of the reductase protein may be the likely mechanism of its inactivation. The enzyme protein did not, however, get degraded under the conditions of inhibition.", 
    "34": "Statin, a nuclear protein of 57,000 daltons, is found in in vitro aged, nonproliferating human fibroblasts but not in their young, replicating counterparts or transformed derivatives; it is also found in the nuclei of young fibroblasts when their growth is arrested but rapidly disappears from the cells once the restriction to growth is removed. We reported earlier that as cells leave the quiescent state, the loss of statin from the nucleus precedes the initiation of DNA synthesis; here we report that in a confluent culture, as cells leave the traverse of the replicative cycle and assume the quiescent phenotype, statin is not expressed maximally until total contact inhibition of growth is achieved. This full manifestation of statin occurs in monolayer culture with cells forming the typical swirling pattern and fibronectin organized into large intercellular cables. The late expression of statin in cells approaching the quiescent state is also verified biochemically by immunoblotting assays. The present results, taken together with those reported earlier, indicate that the nuclear appearance of statin occurs only after the complete cessation of DNA synthesis and that the full manifestation of this protein can be used as a marker for the G0 quiescent state.", 
    "35": "Cholesterogenic activity in normal and leukemic guinea pig lymphocytes was measured by incorporation of labeled sodium acetate into cholesterol, after separation from other labeled metabolites. Our study is in agreement with the large difference previously found between the two kinds of cells at the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase step, but it also shows that the difference is not as great as described earlier, when expressed in terms of the final product, cholesterol. This is mainly due to differences in the analytical methods. Our more detailed procedure showed a blockage of cholesterol synthesis in leukemic guinea pig lymphocytes (L2C cells) at the step of lathosterol (cholest-7-en-3 beta-ol) isomerization, and a higher plasma membrane permeability of these cells for sodium acetate, compared to normal cells. The lack of cholesterogenesis regulation by low density lipoproteins in L2C cells, previously reported after measuring 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity, was confirmed with regard to cholesterol itself, as well as the usual regulation of normal cells, which appeared to occur also at a post-hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA step.", 
    "36": "The lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase inhibitors miconazole and ketoconazole have been used to assess their effects upon cholesterol biosynthesis in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. In Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with either agent, an initial accumulation of lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol has been observed. At elevated concentrations, however, ketoconazole, but not miconazole, causes the preferential accumulation of 24,25-epoxylanosterol and squalene 2,3:22,23-dioxide. These metabolites accumulate at the expense of lanosterol, thereby demonstrating a second site of inhibition for ketoconazole in the sterol biosynthetic pathway. Both demethylase inhibitors produced a biphasic modulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The biphasic modulation is characterized by low levels of the drugs suppressing HMG-CoA reductase activity which is restored to either control or above control values at higher drug concentrations. This modulatory effect of the lanosterol demethylase inhibitors upon HMG-CoA reductase was not observed in the lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase-deficient mutant AR45. Suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity is shown to be due to a decrease in the amount of enzyme protein consistent with a steroidal regulatory mechanism. Collectively, the results establish that lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylation, but not 24,25-epoxylanosterol formation, is required to suppress HMG-CoA reductase in the manner described by lanosterol demethylase inhibitors.", 
    "37": "Cholesterolgenesis could be important for both cell growth and DNA synthesis in many cell types. Since the ocular lens seems at least partially dependent upon biosynthesis to supply its required cholesterol, cholesterolgenesis could have a special role in control of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis in the lens. We thus examined the effects of inhibiting sterol synthesis with mevinolin upon cell proliferation, upon accumulation of DNA, sterol and protein mass and upon DNA synthesis by bovine lens epithelial cells cultured in lipoprotein-deficient media. All DNA synthesis in the ocular lens occurs in the monolayer of epithelial cells which covers the anterior surface of this organ. Concentrations of mevinolin which largely prevented synthesis and accumulation of sterol by the cultured lens epithelial cells and stopped proliferation of these cells had no effect on the cell's DNA synthesis or accumulation of DNA mass. The inhibition of proliferation by mevinolin could be completely reversed by cholesterol added to the culture media in the form of low density lipoprotein. These findings indicate that an adequate supply of cholesterol is required by lens epithelial cells to proceed through the cell cycle. Inhibition of cholesterolgenesis by the lens in vivo could have profound effects upon lens growth and development.", 
    "38": "A basic difference between dietary and drug therapy of hypercholesterolemia is that dietary therapy can be used as part of a population strategy, whereas the decision to use drugs is always made on an individual basis. In each case, the decision to treat must be based on the assumption that more good than harm is caused to the patient. This is a difficult situation for the physician. As long as there is no easy way of assessing the state and rate of progression of coronary lesions, the physician must treat the patient on statistical grounds only, i.e., rely on the results of studies showing that lowering serum cholesterol significantly decreases the risk of coronary events. Such evidence has recently been strengthened, which increases motivation for both physician and patients. The current general opinion is that drug therapy must be generally confined to those at high risk, i.e., patients with severe hypercholesterolemia. For individuals with moderately elevated serum cholesterol levels, dietary advice and correction of other risk factors should be adequate.", 
    "39": "Steroid synthesis requires cholesterol derived from de novo synthesis or plasma lipoproteins. Low density lipoproteins appear to be the major contributor of cholesterol for steroid synthesis in man. Patients with disorders of low density lipoproteins or the low density lipoprotein receptor have reduced cortisol production in response to ACTH. Therapeutic agents designed to lower plasma cholesterol could, therefore, adversely affect steroid hormone production. Lovastatin (mevinolin) is a new hypolipidemic agent which blocks cholesterol synthesis by competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. In beagle dogs, lovastatin at 40-180 times the clinically effective dose in man, has been associated with an increase in spontaneous testicular atrophy. Accordingly, the effect of lovastatin on testicular function and lipoprotein levels was studied in 16 hyperlipidemic men in a randomized, double blind, cross-over study with another hypolipidemic agent, neomycin. Serum testosterone, PRL, LH, and FSH; LHRH-stimulated LH and FSH concentrations; and testicular size were measured, and semen analyses were made. We found no evidence that lovastatin had adverse effects on testicular function despite significant alterations in plasma lipoprotein concentrations.", 
    "40": "HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the conversion of hydroxymethylglutarate to mevalonate, an important early rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Since the discovery of compactin, the first HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, by Endo et al. in 1976, several other inhibitors have been described. Those that have been investigated in the clinic include mevastatin (compactin), lovastatin (mevinolin), simvastatin (synvinolin), eptastatin (CS-514, SQ-31,000), and SRI-62320. These compounds are competitive inhibitors, with Ki values of the hydroxyacid forms of around 10(-9) M. Lovastatin (mevinolin, Mevacor), which is in the late stages of clinical development and has been administered to over 1000 subjects for up to 4 years, is the inhibitor on which the most information is available. It is given in single or divided doses of 20 to 80 mg/day, and is a very effective and usually well-tolerated lipid-lowering agent. At 40 mg bid, lovastatin produces the following approximate mean changes: total plasma cholesterol, -33%; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, -40%; very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, -35%; plasma triglycerides, -25%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, +10%; apolipoprotein B, -20%. The substantial reduction in both LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (the principal protein component of LDL) indicates a reduction in the number of circulating LDL particles. The mechanism probably involves both decreased LDL production and increased LDL clearance.", 
    "41": "Persistent excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid was found in a 6-month-old infant with multiple minor physical malformations and delayed development. During two episodes of intercurrent viral illness, the patient developed severe metabolic acidosis and excreted large amounts of lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate. The excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid did not change during these episodes, nor did it increase following leucine loading. In vitro studies suggest that in this patient, as in the majority of other patients with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, a primary defect in leucine metabolism is not responsible for the biochemical abnormality.", 
    "42": "When normal or hypophysectomized rats maintained on a diet containing mevinolin and colestipol were switched to a normal chow diet, HMG-CoA reductase mRNA fell rapidly with a half-life of 3 hrs. After a 90 min lag period, reductase activity and immunoreactive protein fell in parallel with the mRNA in normal rats. In hypophysectomized rats, reductase activity and protein required 10 and 18 hrs, respectively to fall to 50% of their original levels. Administration of thyroid hormones to hypophysectomized rats resulted in a 3 to 4 fold stabilization of reductase mRNA suggesting that the increased mRNA levels are due in part to a posttranscriptional regulatory effect of thyroid hormones.", 
    "43": "Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, has been shown to be an effective hypocholesterolaemic agent when given in relatively short term studies to normal human subjects and patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. The present report reviews the author's experience with lovastatin in the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolaemia (predominantly attributable to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia) over a four year period. Lovastatin has been well tolerated and patients maintained on this drug as a single agent have shown sustained reductions in the plasma concentrations of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. The hypocholesterolaemic effects of lovastatin can be potentiated by combination therapy with other currently approved lipid lowering medications including bile acid sequestrants and nicotinic acid. Side effects have been uncommon and no consistent pattern of adverse effects of lovastatin has developed with more prolonged use. Lovastatin and related drugs represent a major advance in the therapy of hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "44": "The regulation of sterol synthesis in the lens was addressed in the present study by comparing changes in the activity of HMG CoA reductase to changes in true rates of sterol synthesis for bovine lens epithelial cells in culture. The lens cells possessed very high levels of reductase activity (165 to 241 units/10(6) cells) which doubled when the cells were grown in media depleted of lipoproteins. True rates of sterol synthesis were simultaneously measured from incorporation of tritiated water into digitonin-precipitable sterols. Rates of sterol synthesis increased an average 37% more than the increase in reductase activity when the cells were deprived of exogenous cholesterol. Although not perfect, the results indicate a close correlation between HMG CoA reductase activity and rates of sterol synthesis in lens epithelial cells. We conclude that the activity of HMG CoA reductase is a major determinant of the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the lens.", 
    "45": "The requirement for the sterol biosynthetic pathway for the occurrence of DNA synthesis in glial cells and, in particular, the relative roles of cholesterol and of mevalonate have been studied. Primary cultures of developing glial cells were synchronized by reducing the content of fetal calf serum (FCS) in the culture medium from 10% to 0.1% (vol/vol) for 48 h between days 4 and 6 in culture. Reversal of the resulting quiescent state by the return of the cultures to 10% serum caused after 24 h a marked increase in DNA synthesis, and this increase was prevented by the simultaneous addition of mevinolin, a specific inhibitor of the sterol biosynthetic pathway at the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase step, at the time of serum repletion. A dose-dependent reversal of the mevinolin inhibition of DNA synthesis occurred with simultaneous addition of mevalonate to the culture medium. The induction of DNA synthesis by serum repletion, its inhibition by mevinolin, and the reversal of the inhibition by mevalonate were unaffected by a 95% reduction in exogenous cholesterol produced by utilization of lipoprotein-poor serum (LPPS) rather than FCS. Similarly, return of quiescent cultures to 10% LPPS containing mevinolin and sufficient low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to raise the cholesterol concentration 80-fold failed to restore DNA synthesis. In addition, reversal of the mevinolin inhibition of DNA synthesis by mevalonate occurred despite the continuous presence of mevinolin if mevalonate was added as late as 12 h after serum repletion, but not if added after 16 h or more.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Treatment of 3 beta-benzoyloxy-14 alpha,15 alpha-epoxy-5 alpha-cholest-7-ene with methyl magnesium iodide gave, as the major product, 15 beta-methyl-5 alpha,14 beta-cholest-7-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol. The product was characterized as the free sterol and in the form of its 3 beta-acetoxy and 3 beta-p-bromobenzoate derivatives. Unambiguous assignment of structure was based upon X-ray analysis of the latter derivative. 15 beta-Methyl-5 alpha,14 beta-cholest-7-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol was found to be a potent inhibitor of sterol synthesis in cultured mammalian cells. The 15 beta-methyl-3 beta,15 alpha-dihydroxysterol caused a 50% reduction of the level of HMG-CoA reductase activity and a 50% reduction in the incorporation of labeled acetate into digitonin-precipitable sterols in L cells at a concentration of 3.0 x 10(-6) M.", 
    "47": "Hypocholesterolaemic agents are powerful modifiers of the plasma lipoprotein pattern. In addition to lowering plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, such drugs may elevate, decrease or have no effect on high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Bile acid binding resins and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors cause a reduction in hepatic cholesterol content resulting in stimulation of LDL receptor activity. This decreases the plasma LDL level, while HDL cholesterol levels remain unchanged or increase. Probucol, on the other hand, lowers both LDL and HDL cholesterol. It does not act by stimulating LDL receptor activity and is effective in some patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia who virtually lack LDL receptors. Despite their different lipoprotein-modifying effects, both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and probucol are regarded useful in the prevention and retardation of atherosclerosis.", 
    "48": "In elderly patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease due to lipid abnormalities, numerous medications are available for altering such abnormalities. Most of these drugs have side effects which, in the elderly, may necessitate lower dosing than usual. For persons with severe elevations of triglycerides, nicotinic acid (Niacin) and gemfibrozil (Lopid) may be used. For those who need a reduction in the LDL cholesterol, choices include bile acid-binding resins, nicotinic acid, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, probucol (Lorelco), and neomycin.", 
    "49": "Quiescent serum-starved 3T3 cells can be stimulated to initiate DNA synthesis after addition of conditioned media from spontaneously tumor-transformed 3T3 cells (3T6-cells) or from SV-40-transformed 3T3 cells (SV-3T3 cells). The conditioned media were found to stimulate both the chromosome cycle (i.e., DNA synthesis and cell division) and the growth cycle (i.e., cellular enlargement). Furthermore, addition of conditioned media to quiescent 3T3 cells increased the activity of HMG CoA reductase--an enzyme previously proposed to exercise some control on cell proliferation in 3T3 cells (Larsson and Zetterberg: J. Cell. Physiol. 129:99-102, 1986. The increased activity of HMG CoA reductase after treatment with tumor cell conditioned media was correlated to the stimulatory effects on DNA synthesis. By treating 3T3 cells stimulated to resume proliferation by addition of conditioned media with mevinolin (a competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase) the activity of HMG CoA reductase as well as the DNA synthesis and cell division were efficiently inhibited. In contrast, HMG CoA activity was not coupled to the cellular enlargement. Therefore, it is proposed that one set of factors present in tumor cell conditioned media preferentially stimulates the chromosome cycle by increasing the HMG-CoA reductase activity, whereas another set of factors is responsible for growth in cell size. Both types of factors are required for balanced growth.", 
    "50": "Following the recent demonstration that both cholestyramine and nicotinic acid decrease mortality from coronary heart disease, there is a new enthusiasm for hypolipidaemic therapy. The agents in current use are, however, insufficiently active or are accompanied by unacceptable side effects. An understanding of the mode of action is necessary, both to optimize treatment guidelines (e.g. regarding combination therapy or use in specific subsets of patients) and to develop new agents with preferred actions on rate-limiting steps. A reduction in LDL cholesterol concentration remains the principal desired action, although an elevation in HDL may also be beneficial. The main categories of commercially available agent comprise the anion exchange resins (inhibitors of bile acid absorption); cholesterol absorption inhibitors; fibrates (probably acting by enhancing lipoprotein lipase); and probucol (affecting LDL clearance). The most interesting of the new agents in clinical trials are the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, but other types of agent are at an earlier stage of evaluation, e.g. acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitors and peptide cofactors. It is not yet certain whether all the approaches to cholesterol lowering have equal validity, although an effect on biological endpoints is obtained for a variety of agents. Future evaluation will be aided by the implementation of noninvasive methods to quantify atherosclerosis and by the use of simple, 'dry-chemistry', cholesterol assays to screen populations.", 
    "51": "A method for the measurement of organic acids in human plasma is presented. The analytical procedure consists of plasma protein precipitation with acetonitrile, acid extraction by chromatography through a DEAE-cellulose column eluted with 100 mM perchloric acid, HPLC by cation-exchange column Aminex HPX-87 eluted with 6.5 mM sulfuric acid. Adipic, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric, 2-oxoglutaric, and citric acids were determined in the plasma of diabetic patients. The concentrations of all the measured acids, but particularly those of adipic and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acids, were significantly higher than those of healthy controls. These results suggest that in diabetics the omega-oxidation of fatty acids is enhanced.", 
    "52": "Effects of cholesterol sulfate on acetate incorporation into lipid fractions were examined in normal human fibroblast and keratinocyte cultures. Inhibition of sterologenesis in normal fibroblast cultures by cholesterol sulfate was less profound than that produced by either lipoprotein-containing serum or 25-hydroxycholesterol. Cholesterol sulfate also inhibited sterologenesis in low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient fibroblasts and inhibited both sterologenesis and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in keratinocytes. Cholesterol sulfate increased incorporation of acetate into fatty acid-containing lipids in preconfluent cultures of both cell types in lipoprotein-depleted media. Similar effects were not observed either in response to lipoprotein-containing serum or 25-hydroxycholesterol. Cholesterol sulfate had no effect on oleic acid incorporation into diglycerides, triglycerides, or phospholipid fractions; neither did it inhibit acid lipase activity; nor did it inhibit fatty acid oxidation, indicating that cholesterol sulfate does not inhibit catabolism of acyl lipids. Because cholesterol sulfate had similar effects on fatty acid metabolism in steroid sulfatase-deficient fibroblasts lines, desulfation to cholesterol is not a prerequisite. Cholesterol sulfate did not significantly affect incorporation of oleic acid into sterol esters in fibroblast cultures, but in contrast, inhibited sterol esterification in keratinocyte cultures. These data suggest a novel role for cholesterol sulfate as a modulator of cellular lipid biosynthesis.", 
    "53": "MK-733, which is a competitive inhibitor of the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, or a matching placebo was administered to 30 subjects with primary hypercholesterolaemia (who were already receiving dietary treatment) over a period of four weeks in a double-blind trial. Twenty-one subjects manifested heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and nine subjects had polygenic hypercholesterolaemia. Five subjects received placebo, 15 subjects a low dose of MK-733 (2.5-10 mg/day) and 10 subjects received a high dose of MK-733 (20-80 mg/day). Plasma cholesterol levels in subjects who were receiving MK-733 declined significantly and in a dose-dependent fashion (31% reduction in plasma cholesterol levels with a high dose, 19% reduction with a low dose). Eight of 10 subjects who were receiving a high dose of MK-733 achieved better than a 30% reduction in plasma cholesterol levels after four weeks of treatment. The response was independent of the presence or absence of familial hypercholesterolaemia. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not change significantly, but there was a suggestive, dose-dependent reduction in plasma triglyceride levels after four weeks of treatment. MK-733 was well-tolerated, appeared to be safe, and may ultimately become an important drug in the management of more severe grades of hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "54": "The activity of the soluble form of phosphatidic acid phosphatase in rat liver was stimulated about 2.5-fold by inclusion of mevinolin, a competitive hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, in the diet (0.1%). The stimulatory effect of mevinolin was present also after dietary addition of cholestyramine (5%) or intraperitoneal administration of ethanol. Addition of cholesterol (2%) to the diet totally abolished the stimulation by mevinolin on phosphatidic acid phosphatase. The results support a correlation between the synthesis of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and the activity of the apparent rate-limiting enzyme in triacylglycerol biosynthesis.", 
    "55": "Lipid abnormalities can be treated effectively with various lipid-lowering agents. However, it bears repeating that no patient with hyperlipidemia should be treated with drugs until an adequate trial of dietary intervention, which may take as long as six months, has been attempted. While knowledge of a patient's precise metabolic and genetic abnormality is often desirable, it generally is not necessary for the institution of lipid-lowering drug therapy. Judicious use of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total triglyceride measurements is sufficient for selection of the proper drug or drugs. A patient who does not respond should be referred to a specialized lipid center for more sophisticated evaluation and therapy.", 
    "56": "Mevinolin and compactin are fungal metabolites which inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian systems. Biogenetically, mevinolin is formed from polyketide chains, one 18-carbon and one 4-carbon, derived from acetate in normal head to tail fashion. The remaining two carbons in mevinolin, namely C-2' and C-6 methyl groups, are transferred from S-adenosylmethionine. To distinguish the timing and sequence of these two methylation steps, [Me-14C]- and [Me-3H,14C]-L-methionine were fed to Aspergillus terreus at several selected production intervals. Location and distribution of labels were determined by the specific chemical degradation methods. The results have demonstrated clearly that transfer of methyl groups from two S-adenosylmethionine molecules to the biosynthetic precursors of mevinolin was a sequential process. Methylation at C-6 preceded that at C-2' of mevinolin. Both methylation steps proceeded with complete retention of hydrogens. Methyl groups were probably transferred to the anion-like intermediates.", 
    "57": "Oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol are believed to play a role in cellular cholesterol homeostasis through the feed-back control of its biosynthesis. We report that 26-hydroxycholesterol inhibits the specific binding, uptake and degradation of 125I-LDL in human fibroblasts. The effect is dose-dependent, and saturation kinetics indicates a reduction of LDL-binding sites with no effect on ligand affinity. The results support a possible role of 26-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological oxysterol, in the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis.", 
    "58": "CS-514 is a metabolic product of compactin and has a potent cholesterol-lowering effect in vitro and in animal studies by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. The efficacy and adverse effects of the agent were studied in 41 hypercholesterolemic subjects by administering daily doses of 5, 20, or 40 mg for four weeks under double-blind conditions. Mean total serum cholesterol level was reduced by 11.1% in the 5-mg group, 18.8% in the 20-mg group, and 25.3% in the 40-mg group. Marked reduction of total serum cholesterol level was also observed in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemics. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and apolipoprotein B concentration decreased by 38.5% and 28.8%, respectively, in the 40-mg group, while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased by 11.8%. No serious clinical and laboratory abnormalities were observed. Plasma cortisol and testosterone levels were not significantly affected. These results suggest that CS-514 will be a useful agent in the treatment of nonfamilial and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "59": "The oligodendroglial enzyme, 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNP), is a valuable marker for expression of oligodendroglial differentiation in glial primary cultures, and the inducibility of this enzyme by dibutyryl-3',5'-cyclic AMP (dBcAMP) appears to be limited to immature or developing oligodendroglia. To investigate the relationship between the induction of CNP and the sterol biosynthetic pathway, primary cultures of glia dissociated from the brains of newborn rats were maintained in 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and exposed to 1 mM dBcAMP on day 7 in culture. Cultures so treated for either 48 h or 72 h demonstrated a three- to fourfold induction of CNP specific activity. The magnitude of this induction was not affected when the cholesterol content of the culture medium was reduced by greater than 95% by placing the cultures in 10% lipoprotein-poor serum rather than 10% FCS during the exposure to dBcAMP. Mevinolin (10 microM), a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the sterol biosynthetic pathway, completely inhibited the induction of CNP by dBcAMP, while not affecting either the accumulation of cellular protein per flask or rate of protein synthesis. Simultaneous addition of mevalonate (20 mM) prevented the inhibition of the induction of CNP by mevinolin. However, simultaneous addition of low-density lipoprotein sufficient to increase the cholesterol content of the medium 80-fold failed to correct mevinolin's inhibition of the induction of CNP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "60": "We studied the effect of ACTH, alone or in combination with cycloheximide, on hamster adrenal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase protein content (mass) and activity. Immunoblotting was performed on both homogenate and microsomal preparations, using a rabbit antirat liver reductase antibody and 125I-labeled protein A. A dose-dependent increase in HMG-CoA reductase protein content and activity was produced by ACTH. A time-course study revealed a latency of 60 min, followed by a significant increase at 120 and 180 min, in this response. At 180 min, microsomal reductase activity was significantly increased 4.7-fold, whereas the reductase protein content of microsomes and homogenate preparations was enhanced 4.4- and 3.1-fold, respectively. We calculated that only 40-50% of the reductase protein content was microsomal, indicating that more than one pool of the enzyme is present in adrenals. The coadministration of cycloheximide with ACTH not only prevented the hormonal effect on the protein content and activity of the reductase, but also produced, 180 min posttreatment, 58-69% and 65-86% decreases in reductase protein and activity, respectively. Also, both reductase activity and protein content fluctuated in parallel during the day. In the presence of proteolytic enzyme inhibitors and iodoacetamide, a major band in the area of 102K mol wt was evidenced by immunoblotting. These results indicate that ACTH and other conditions that provoke a change in adrenal HMG-CoA reductase activity also induce, in parallel, a change in the reductase protein content. The basic unit of the reductase has an apparent mol wt of about 102K.", 
    "61": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid administration to streptozotocin-diabetic rats produced a net decrease of plasma ketone bodies and triglycerides together with a slight decrease of total cholesterol. A nonsignificant enhancement of HDL-cholesterol and a negligible change in HDL-phospholipid was also observed. The effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate was dose dependent and was more evident with the compound intraperitoneally injected than orally administered with drinking water. [14C]-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate was administered either orally or intraperitoneally both to diabetic and control groups of animals, and a higher radioactivity accumulated in liver and kidneys of diabetic rats compared to the controls. The possible mechanism of action of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarate is briefly discussed.", 
    "62": "Using a stepwise selection procedure, we have developed a line of mouse FM3A cells which is resistant to compactin (ML-236B), a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This line, designated CR200, expressed a stable phenotype of a greater than 100-fold higher resistance to the inhibitor and a 160-fold higher HMG-CoA reductase activity than did the parental FM3A cell line when grown in the presence of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). In contrast to its action in the parental cells, HMG-CoA reductase in CR200 cells was not suppressed by human LDL. The activity of both cell-surface binding and degradation of 125I-LDL was approximately 10% in CR200 cells as compared with that in parental cells. Affinity of the 125I-LDL binding in CR200 cells was similar to that in the parental cells. In addition, HMG-CoA reductase was not suppressed normally by mevalonate and 25-hydroxycholesterol in CR200 cells; suppression was 50-60% by both compounds under conditions where suppression was about 99% in the parental cells. Sterol synthesis from [3H]mevalonate was normal in the variant cells. These observations demonstrate two defects in CR200 cells: decreased levels of LDL receptor and a defective regulation of HMG-CoA reductase by one or more products derived from mevalonate. When grown without compactin for 21 weeks, the variant cells became slightly sensitive to compactin and concomitantly recovered partly from both defects. However, these phenotypes of CR200 cells were stable up to 15 months when exposed to compactin. These two defects may account for the overaccumulation of HMG-CoA reductase in CR200 cells and thereby for the resistance to compactin.", 
    "63": "Effects of CS-514, a new competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, on serum lipoprotein lipid and apolipoprotein levels were studied in 13 heterozygous patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Treatment with 10 mg of CS-514 twice daily reduced total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) cholesterol levels by 25%, 33%, and 33%, respectively, and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels by 15%. Apolipoprotein B, E, and C-II levels decreased by 24%, 20%, and 19%, and apolipoproteins A-I and A-II levels increased by 10% and 7%, respectively. One patient showed abnormally high levels of SGOT, SGPT, and serum alkaline phosphatase, which returned to normal levels immediately after the cessation of CS-514. No other adverse effects were observed. Thus, CS-514 reduces atherogenic lipoproteins and apolipoprotein B, and increases HDL and apolipoprotein A-I and A-II, and appears to be a useful drug for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "64": "Ketoconazole, an imidazole derivative, is a member of a class of metabolic inhibitors acting specifically at cytochrome-P450 mediated reactions. We studied the effects of this compound on cholesterol synthesis, and on HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor activities, in cultures of human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. Ketoconazole, added in concentrations of 2-100 microM, inhibited cholesterol synthesis, and caused accumulation of lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol. Total mass formation of sterols was depressed. After 20 hr preincubation of the cells with the drug in these concentrations, activity of HMG-CoA reductase was markedly decreased, while the receptor-mediated binding, uptake and degradation of human LDL were increased. This increase is at least partly due to a higher affinity of LDL for its receptor. Ketoconazole prevented the fall in LDL-receptor activity caused by preincubation with LDL, whereas it did not affect the suppression caused by preincubation with exogenous mevalonate. These findings are discussed with respect to the involvement of endogenous sterol and non-sterol effectors of reductase and receptor activities.", 
    "65": "Six sequential clinical trials were conducted over 5 years to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different treatment regimens for hypercholesterolemia. Of all the study participants, 11 patients were evaluated in all 6 clinical trials using the following regimens: neomycin, neomycin/niacin, cholestyramine, cholestyramine/neomycin, lovastatin and lovastatin/neomycin. All 6 regimens significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced both total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations by 25 to 42% from baseline levels. Only neomycin/niacin, cholestyramine and lovastatin significantly increased the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration, reducing the total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio to less than 4.7. Thus, all 6 tested regimens were effective in modifying the plasma lipoprotein concentrations in type II hyperlipoproteinemia, but neomycin/niacin, cholestyramine and lovastatin had the most favorable impact. Only lovastatin treatment was free of adverse effects.", 
    "66": "The 5-amino analogues of mevalonic acid and mevalonolactone, 5-amino-3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid (VII a) and 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-piperidone (III a), and some related compounds were synthesized as possible inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. None of them was found effective on the synthesis of cholesterol in rat liver slices and on HMG-CoA reductase activity in vitro, but 4-hydroxy-4-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-piperidone (III b) raised high density lipoproteins (HDL) in normolipaemic rats.", 
    "67": "Mevinolin is a potent competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme catalyzing the major rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. In this study the drug was administered as an intragastric dose at 2.5 mg/kg/day to 10 to 12-week-old lean and obese Zucker female rats over a 5-day period. Mevinolin showed no effect on plasma cholesterol levels in the lean rat; however, in the obese rat there was a significant decrease in plasma cholesterol (about a 40% decrease from initial levels). Although there was a difference in effect on plasma cholesterol levels in obese and lean rats, hepatocytes isolated from both fed lean and obese rats incubated with various concentrations of mevinolin exhibited similar levels of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and showed no effects on the other metabolic processes studied. These results indicate that the drug was effective acutely on cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes isolated from both lean and obese rats, but on a chronic treatment basis the hypocholesterolemic effect was observed only in the obese Zucker rat. This study supports the idea that the naturally occurring hypercholesterolemic obese Zucker rat may be a good model for testing potential new cholesterol lowering agents.", 
    "68": "A study was conducted to determine whether repression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase by a chronic high-cholesterol diet would deplete hepatic dolichol levels. Four-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were maintained on a control diet or a diet supplemented with 5% cholesterol. Animals from both groups were killed at various times and reductase activity and levels of free dolichol, dolichyl acyl ester, dolichyl phosphate, and ubiquinone were measured. The reductase activity was reduced by 90% within 1 week and remained depressed through 56 days. Initially, the levels of the free dolichol, acyl ester, phosphoryl ester, and ubiquinone were 7, 16, 5, and 80 micrograms/g liver, respectively. Early increases in the concentration of dolichyl phosphate and free dolichol were similar in both the cholesterol-fed and control groups. However, in the cholesterol-fed group the concentration of dolichyl acyl esters was only 50% of that in the control group by 7 days and it remained lower throughout the experiment. Total dolichol levels were lower by about 30%. Ubiquinone levels were transiently depressed at 7 days by 33% but returned to control levels by 4 weeks. After 56 days, the control values of dolichol and dolichyl phosphate remained constant whereas the dolichyl acyl ester levels continuously increased to a value of 133 micrograms/g of liver by 156 days. Subcellular fractionation of livers from 4-week-old mice indicated a lysosomal distribution of dolichol and dolichyl acyl ester and a lysosomal and microsomal distribution of dolichyl phosphate.", 
    "69": "Because the small bowel is a site of significant cholesterol synthesis, we determined the ileal distribution of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Immunofluorescence microscopy on unfixed snap-frozen sections of ileum and jejunum from untreated rats or dogs showed HMG-CoA reductase in the absorptive villus epithelial cells and this appeared to be strikingly localized in their apical cytoplasm. This pattern of HMG-CoA reductase staining approximated a gradient along the villus-crypt axis with the distal villi labeling most intensely. Treatment of rats with mevinolin and/or cholestyramine for 12 days induced a 5- to 11-fold increase in ileal HMG-CoA reductase activity, and yielded a higher intensity of immunostaining without altering the pattern of enzyme distribution observed in control intestines. Also, rats with maximal induction of ileal HMG-CoA reductase exhibited a twofold increase in the number of epithelial villus cells containing prominent stacks of smooth-surfaced membranes in their apical cytoplasm as seen with electron microscopy. These observations suggest that the distal villus absorptive epithelial cells of the ileum contain high concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase, and therefore might be capable of contributing significant quantities of cholesterol to the circulation.", 
    "70": "Adrenal steroidogenesis is dependent upon cholesterol derived from both de novo biosynthesis and uptake of plasma lipoproteins through the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor pathway. Recent studies have demonstrated that patients homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia have a mild impairment in cortisol secretion during maximal ACTH stimulation. Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, has been used clinically to inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. In this study we examined hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function in seven patients with defects in the LDL receptor pathway, both before and during treatment with oral mevinolin (20 mg, twice a day), to assess whether inhibition of cholesterol synthesis influences steroidogenesis under basal conditions and in response to ovine CRH and exogenous ACTH. Two months after initiation of therapy, high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly elevated, and LDL cholesterol levels were reduced, although not normalized. Basal and ovine CRH-stimulated adrenocortical function were normal in all patients both before and during therapy. Plateau plasma cortisol concentrations achieved during maximal ACTH stimulation were lower than those in control subjects in all patients both before and during therapy. All patients, however, had an approximately 3-fold increase over basal values. These results suggest that treatment of patients with defects in the LDL receptor pathway with mevinolin improves the plasma lipid profile and does not result in adrenal dysfunction or further exacerbation of the mild impairment of adrenal function during maximal ACTH stimulation.", 
    "71": "Incorporation of [35S]methionine into low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptors by normal fibroblasts and those from a homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemic (FH) subject who produced defective but immunoprecipitable receptor proteins of normal size, was compared with the ability of the cells to bind LDL and their content of LDL receptor protein determined using a double-antibody radioimmunoassay. The FH cells produced precursor protein with a longer half-life (3-4 h) than normal cells (40 min), most of which was eventually processed to a mature form of the receptor. Total receptor half-life was similar to normal (approx. 12 h) and LDL binding about 20% of normal. Incubation of normal fibroblasts with lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) led to an increase in the amount of LDL receptor protein in the cells which was closely followed by the increase in their ability to bind LDL. Receptor synthesis increased rapidly at first, but then fell by more than 60% before remaining constant. The peak of synthesis coincided with the greatest rate of increase in receptor content. At equilibrium in LPDS receptor synthesis, LDL binding and receptor protein content were all approximately 3.3-fold higher than in cells maintained in 10% foetal calf serum (FCS). The FH cells also responded to LPDS with a rise and fall in the rate of receptor synthesis. They did not compensate for their inefficiency in producing active receptors with an increase in total receptor content. In LPDS, peak synthesis and maximum receptor content of the FH cells were similar to normal. In FCS receptor synthesis and content were well below maximum so that they did not fully employ even the low capacity for LDL uptake of which they were capable. With both types of cell, inhibition of mevalonic acid and cholesterol synthesis with compactin delayed, but did not prevent the secondary fall in the rate of receptor synthesis, again suggesting a regulatory role for some factor not directly related to cholesterol metabolism.", 
    "72": "A variant of a low density lipoprotein receptor-negative Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutant was isolated using a nutritional selection called MeLoCo. The variant, designated met-18b-2, internalized and metabolized mevalonate at rates 10-40 times greater than the progenitor cells from which they were derived. The extent of incorporation of radioactivity from [3H]mevalonate into steroidal and nonsteroidal mevalonate derivatives, including modified proteins, was much greater in met-18b-2 cells than in their progenitors. Much of the internalized [3H]mevalonate was converted to nonpolar lipids. Unlike wild type CHO cells or the receptor-negative progenitors, met-18b-2 cells were killed by high concentrations of mevalonate (greater than 6 mM) in the culture medium. Regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity and cholesterol esterification was dramatically more sensitive to mevalonate in met-18b-2 cells than in progenitor cells. In cell extracts, both the rates of conversion of [3H]mevalonate to cholesterol and mevalonate kinase activities were similar for met-18b-2 and progenitor cells. In contrast to progenitor cells, met-18b-2 cells internalized [3H]mevalonate with high capacity (Km approximately 0.3 mM) kinetics. The increased uptake of [3H]mevalonate was temperature dependent and highly specific. These results suggest that met-18b-2 cells express a mevalonate transport activity that is not normally expressed by CHO cells. This activity may be due to a specific mevalonate transporter that is differentially expressed in specialized tissues. Because intracellular mevalonate in met-18b-2 cells can be labeled to high specific activity, these cells should prove very useful in further characterizing the structures of mevalonate derivatives and their metabolism.", 
    "73": "This article is aimed at reviewing and analyzing studies that are related to the possible therapeutic use of a potent and ubiquitously-distributed hormone--somato-statin (SS-14), and its analogues. Administration of these substances has provided beneficial effects in treating acromegaly, gastro-intestinal hemorrhagic and hypersecretory disorders, acute pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, and certain types of cancer. Further studies with SS-14-analogues might provide new therapies for treating certain life-threatening disorders of man.", 
    "74": "A monensin-resistant clone (Monr-31) shows a related series of differences from its parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line in the cellular response to several ligands. The uptake and metabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in the mutant cells are defective. Accumulation of fluorescent-labeled LDL as well as internalization and degradation of 125I-LDL are greatly reduced in Monr-31 cells. The receptor number for LDL on the cell surface of Monr-31 is about one-third that for CHO cells, but affinity constants for both cell lines are similar. Electrophoretic analysis shows a slightly reduced molecular weight of LDL receptor in Monr-31 cells in comparison to that in CHO cells. The internalization index (internalization plus degradation per binding) of LDL of the mutant is about one-half that of CHO cells, suggesting a failure of internalization of LDL as well as LDL binding. Hybrids (hyb-1, -2, and -3) between CHO and Monr-31 cells show LDL binding and LDL internalization activities comparable to that of CHO cells, suggesting that the altered LDL response in Monr-31 cells is recessive. Addition of exogenous LDL to culture medium down-regulates the LDL receptor activity of CHO, hyb-2, and hyb-3 cells, whereas no such down-regulation is seen in Monr-31 cells. Probably as a result of the failure of down-regulation, the prominent inhibition of sterol synthesis from acetate and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase observed in CHO cells is scarcely detectable in Monr-31 cells. As a correlated result, sterol synthesis from acetate is 6-fold higher in the mutant. The failure of down-regulation of LDL receptors in Monr-31 cells is discussed in relation to the altered binding and internalization of LDL.", 
    "75": "Incubating Hep G2 cells for 18 h with triparanol, buthiobate and low concentrations (less than 0.5 microM) of U18666A, inhibitors of desmosterol delta 24-reductase, of lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase and of squalene-2,3-epoxide cyclase (EC 5.4.99.7) respectively, resulted in a decrease of the HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase activity. However, U18666A at concentrations higher than 3 microM increased the HMG-CoA reductase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. None of these inhibitors influenced directly the reductase activity in Hep G2 cell homogenates. Analysis by t.l.c. of 14C-labelled non-saponifiable lipids formed from either [14C]acetate or [14C]mevalonate during the cell incubations confirmed the sites of action of the drugs used. Beside the 14C-labelled substrates of the blocked enzymes and 14C-labelled cholesterol, another non-saponifiable lipid fraction was observed, which behaves as polar sterols on t.l.c. This was the case with triparanol and at those concentrations of U18666A that decreased the reductase activity, suggesting that polar sterols may play a role in suppressing the reductase activity. In the presence of 30 microM-U18666A (sterol formation blocked) the increase produced by simultaneously added compactin could be prevented by addition of mevalonate. This indicates the existence of a non-sterol mevalonate-derived effector in addition to a sterol-dependent regulation. LDL (low-density lipoprotein), which was shown to be able to decrease the compactin-induced increase in reductase activity, could not prevent the U18666A-induced increase. On the contrary, LDL enhanced the U18666A effect, showing that the LDL regulation is not merely the result of introducing cholesterol to the cells.", 
    "76": "In rat hepatocytes cultured in lipoprotein-deficient serum, the uptake and degradation of chylomicron remnant cholesteryl ester per mg cell protein varies inversely with cell density. Compactin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase, stimulates the uptake at all cell densities. Mevalonic acid, on the other hand, can suppress a significant part of the remnant uptake. Chylomicron remnant uptake in hepatocyte cultures can thus be influenced by factors known to regulate the apolipoprotein-BE receptor activity.", 
    "77": "The introduction of inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis offers a new approach to treatment of hypercholesterolemia. One such agent, lovastatin (formerly, mevinolin), causes significant reductions in plasma cholesterol levels. This action can be enhanced by bile acid sequestrants. In this study, lovastatin and colestipol hydrochloride together were administered to ten patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolemia. Compared with a control period, the combined-drug therapy caused a 36% reduction in plasma total cholesterol level, a 48% decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level, and a 17% increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. The reduction in LDL cholesterol level was due to three factors: a 27% decrease in the production rate of LDL, a 20% increase in fractional catabolic rate of LDL, and a 15% depletion of cholesterol in LDL particles. This major reduction in LDL cholesterol level produced by combined-drug therapy may be valuable for prevention of coronary heart disease in high-risk patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "78": "Incubation of monolayers of cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells with oxygenated sterols (25-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, or cholesterol 5,6-epoxide) markedly inhibited growth though the viability of the culture was not affected. The effects on growth was concentration dependent, and 25-hydroxycholesterol was the most potent inhibitor of cellular growth as measured by decreased incorporation of thymidine into DNA and suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity. The inhibitory effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol on cellular growth was not reversible if the cultures were grown in medium with normal fetal calf serum. However, in medium with delipidated serum, addition of purified cholesterol partially prevented growth inhibition induced by 25-hydroxycholesterol. Purified cholesterol, independently or in combination with tocopherol had no toxic effect on cellular growth. Addition of cholesterol oxides to the incubation medium stimulated lysosomal activation and release of acid phosphatase into the culture medium. The effect was concentration dependent and inversely related to cellular growth.", 
    "79": "Cholesterol availability is a major determinant of the capacity of lymphocytes to proliferate. Either endogenously-synthesized cholesterol or that taken up from the medium can be utilized as a source for new membrane biosynthesis. Mitogenic stimulation of human lymphocytes augments the rate of endogenous sterol synthesis. This mitogen-induced increase in lymphocyte sterol synthesis can be observed within 4 h of stimulation and is prevented by suppressing the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase with the specific inhibitors ML-236B or mevinolin. The resultant inhibition of lymphocyte sterol synthesis does not affect mitogen-stimulated blast transformation or initial entry into the S phase of the cell cycle, even when no source of exogenous sterol is present. However, maximal enlargement of the stimulated blast cells is suppressed by inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity, and lymphocyte proliferation is completely prevented. These inhibitory effects are reversed by the addition either of mevalonate, the product of the inhibited enzyme, or of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The finding that LDL cholesterol could not support growth of lymphocytes obtained from individuals who lacked LDL receptors indicates that LDL-mediated delivery of exogenous sterols to proliferating lymphocytes requires intact LDL receptors. The data indicate that neither endogenous sterol synthesis nor a source of cholesterol is necessary for mitogen-stimulated activation and blast transformation of human lymphocytes. Subsequent enlargement and cell division requires either sterol synthesis or an exogenous source of cholesterol. When the exogenous source of cholesterol is in the form of LDL, normal LDL receptors are also necessary.", 
    "80": "The role of lipids in the pathogenesis of focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) was evaluated using two chemically different lipid lowering agents, clofibric acid and mevinolin. Pharmacologically, these two agents have different mechanisms of action. Clofibric acid affects both cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, while mevinolin inhibits 3-hydroxy-3 methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in cellular cholesterol synthesis. In two different models of FGS in which hyperlipidemia occurs, the obese Zucker rat and the 5/6 nephrectomy model, both agents significantly reduced FGS and albuminuria. Since glomerular hemodynamic function is normal in obese Zucker rats, these results suggested that lipids are an independent factor in the pathogenesis of FGS. Moreover, in the 5/6 nephrectomy model, the beneficial effects on glomerular structure of reducing serum lipids occurred despite persistent systemic and glomerular hypertension. Thus, we postulated that a synergistic interaction between lipids and hypertension might exist in the pathogenesis of FGS.", 
    "81": "Lovastatin is a potent new drug for lowering serum cholesterol through inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis. Metabolic studies with lovastatin in healthy volunteers and patients with hypercholesterolemia suggest reduced synthesis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as well as enhanced catabolism LDL-C mediated through LDL receptors as the principal mechanisms for lipid-lowering effects. Total cholesterol and LDL-C are reduced by 30% or more on average when added to baseline therapy, with the effects being more pronounced in nonfamilial than in familial hypercholesterolemia. Optimal dosing appears to be 20 mg given twice a day. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal, while the most serious are elevated transaminase levels and the potential for lens opacities. Lovastatin is the first of a new class of lipid-lowering agents, and is effective when added to diet therapy or in combination with other drugs.", 
    "82": "A murine killer T cell line, G-CTLL 1, whose proliferation depends on the presence of interleukin 2 (IL-2), was used to analyze the mechanism of IL-2 action with respect to sterol synthesis and arachidonate metabolism. De novo sterol synthesis was substantially enhanced much earlier than DNA synthesis, and the rate reached a maximum at 13 hr after the addition of IL-2. Compactin, which is a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase, the enzyme in the rate-limiting step of the sterol synthesis), inhibited the IL-2-induced DNA synthesis. The addition of mevalonate, the product of HMG CoA reductase, prevented the inhibition of DNA synthesis by compactin, suggesting that the supply of a sufficient amount of sterol is an essential prerequisite for IL-2 action. The IL-2-induced DNA synthesis was also inhibited by AA861, a specific inhibitor of arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase, and by other lipoxygenase inhibitors such as nordihydroguaiaretic acid and esculetin. In contrast, indomethacin, an inhibitor of arachidonate cyclooxygenase, had no effect. These findings suggest that synthesis of 5-lipoxygenase products is also a prerequisite. The inhibition of DNA synthesis was effectively inhibited only when compactin or lipoxygenase inhibitors were added early enough to block the synthesis of sterols or 5-lipoxygenase products; addition of the reagents after 3 hr decreased the inhibition with time. Therefore, about 3 hr after the addition of IL-2, several drastic intracellular changes are assumed to begin and to lead to DNA synthesis.", 
    "83": "The regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase was studied in mouse uterine epithelium. The enzyme was rapidly inactivated during incubation with ATP/Mg2+ in vitro, and could be re-activated by incubation with partially purified rat liver phosphoprotein phosphatase. Enzyme activity was rapidly inhibited by mevalonate injection in vivo to approx. 30% of control. The percentage of total enzyme active in vivo was measured by inclusion of NaF in the isolation buffers. The percentage of enzyme active in vivo 18 h after stimulation by oestrogens remained at approx. 25% after inhibition of activity by mevalonate injection, cholesterol feeding or progesterone pretreatment. However, 9 h after oestrogen stimulation, cholesterol feeding inhibited enzyme activity to 57% of control, 94% of which was in the active form. We conclude that, although all components for a reversible phosphorylative regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity are present in uterine epithelial cells, a role in the rapid changes in epithelial enzyme activity has not been demonstrated.", 
    "84": "Primary monolayer cultures of human fetal adrenal cells maintained in either lipoprotein-depleted or lipoprotein-supplemented media responded chronically to ACTH treatment with similarly increased steroid secretion. The principal steroid secreted into each medium was dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. The presence of human low density lipoprotein (hLDL) in the medium enhanced the secretion of nonsulfoconjugated steroids, especially dehydroepiandrosterone. The secretion rate of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione was similar to that of cortisol. In the absence of hLDL, ACTH increased cholesterologenesis to maintain the high rates of steroid secretion. After ACTH treatment, increased accumulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a rate-determining enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, was found. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that this enzyme was a 97K protein in human fetal adrenal cells. Interestingly, the content of this enzyme in cells treated with ACTH in lipoprotein-depleted medium was similar to that in adrenal fetal zone tissue. This finding suggests that cholesterologenesis de novo in addition to plasma LDL is important as a source of steroid precursor in vivo in the human fetal adrenal gland."
