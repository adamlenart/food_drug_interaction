    "0": "Postprandial lipemia has emerged as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. In this systematic review we examined the effect of the medications used for the management of dyslipidemia on postprandial lipemia. Statins, beyond their effects on fasting lipid levels, reduce also postprandial lipemia mainly by inhibiting the production of apoB containing lipoproteins from the liver and thus increasing the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins of either liver or intestinal origin. Fibrates decrease fasting triglyceride and increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Besides, fibrates are particularly potent drugs in the reduction of postprandial lipemia; they decrease the production or triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and increase their clearance by enhancing the activity of lipoprotein lipase.", 
    "1": "We report a case of rosuvastatin induced rhabdomyolysis in a low risk patient, who presented with five-day history of generalized muscle pain, weakness and easy fatigability associated with passing dark urine. Initial investigations showed creatinine 140micromol/L, creatine kinase (CK) 4566 U/L and serum myoglobin 2694 ng/ml with a significant increase in urine myoglobin. Although there were no obvious risk factors, the patient was diagnosed with rosuvastatin induced rhabdomyolysis. The drug was stopped on the first day of admission and the patient was initiated on intravenous fluid with cautious monitoring of serum electrolytes. On the following days the level of creatine kinase and serum myoglobin returned toward normal and consequently he was discharged without statins but on dietary therapy. On follow-up evaluation, the patient was symptom free his serum creatinine was 106micromol/L, whereas his LDL cholesterol was 2.1mmol/L. The rosuvastatin induced rhabdomyolysis is discussed and the danger of its use in low risk patients is emphasized.", 
    "2": "The objective of this study was to demonstrate that Bama miniature pigs are a suitable experimental animal model for the evaluation of drugs for man. To this end, in vitro lovastatin metabolism at the minipig liver microsomal level and in vivo pharmacokinetics were studied. Results were compared with those obtained from humans. Our data indicate that the main metabolites and enzyme kinetic parameters of lovastatin metabolism are similar in pigs and humans. Triacetyloleandomycin, a specific inhibitor of human CYP3A4, inhibited the metabolism of lovastatin in pig and human liver microsomes. In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters and absolute bioavailability suggested that the absorption and elimination of lovastatin in Bama miniature pigs were similar to those in humans. Lovastatin was distributed across many organs in pigs, but the highest levels were found in the stomach, intestines, and liver. Within 96 h, 7% and 82% of the given dose was excreted in the urine and feces, respectively. In addition, no significant species differences in the plasma protein binding ratio of lovastatin and the rates of lovastatin hydrolysis to beta-hydroxyacid lovastatin were apparent. From these results, we conclude that Bama miniature pigs are suitable for use in drug evaluation studies.",

To estimate the efficiency of treatment we used modern laboratory-instrumental, ultrasonic and biochemical methods of examinations. The examinations of indexs of fat exchange in bile and blood showed the communication of theirs disturbances. The application of chophytol and vasilip in the treatment of the first stage of gallstone disease is prove the positive changes of clinical symptoms of illness and lead to improvement of liver functional condition and biochemical composition of bile. These changes are cause to decrease of risk of formation the gallstones.", 
    "4": "LDL can vary considerably in its cholesterol content; thus, lowering LDL cholesterol (LDLC) as a goal of statin treatment implies the existence of considerable variation in the extent to which statin treatment removes circulating LDL particles. This consideration is particularly applicable in diabetes mellitus, in which LDL is frequently depleted of cholesterol.", 
    "5": "Type 2 diabetes patients randomly allocated to 10 mg/day atorvastatin (n = 1154) or to placebo (n = 1196) for 1 year were studied to compare spontaneous and statin-induced apolipoprotein B (apo B) concentrations (a measure of LDL particle concentration) at LDLC and non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDLC) concentrations proposed as statin targets in type 2 diabetes.", 
    "6": "Patients treated with atorvastatin produced lower serum apo B concentrations at any given LDLC concentration than patients on placebo. An LDLC concentration of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) during atorvastatin treatment was equivalent to a non-HDLC concentration of 2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or an apo B concentration of 0.8 g/L. At the more conservative LDLC targets of 2.59 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and 3.37 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) for non-HDLC, however, the apo B concentration exceeded the 0.9-g/L value anticipated in the recent Consensus Statement from the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology.",

    "8": "Abnormal lipids are associated with the development of coronary heart disease; for this reason, lipid-lowering agents have become a standard of care. The purposes of this case report are: (1) to highlight the association of impaired inspiratory muscle performance (IMP) with statin therapy and (2) to describe potentially useful methods of examining and treating people with known or suspected statin-induced skeletal myopathies (SISMs).", 
    "9": "The patient had breathlessness on exertion and a restrictive lung disorder from a right hemidiaphragmatic paralysis, for which he was prescribed high-intensity inspiratory muscle training (IMT). He had a secondary diagnosis of hyperlipidemia, which was treated with 40 mg of simvastatin after 5(1/2) months of IMT.", 
    "10": "The improvements in IMP, symptoms, and functional status obtained from almost 6 months of high-intensity IMT were lost after the commencement of simvastatin. However, 3 weeks after termination of simvastatin combined with high-intensity IMT, the patient's IMP, symptoms, and functional status exceeded pre-statin levels.", 
    "11": "This case report suggests that high-intensity IMT can be used effectively in a patient with impaired diaphragmatic function and during recovery from a respiratory SISM. The marked reduction in IMP and inability to perform IMT resolved with the cessation of statin therapy. The case report also highlights the potential effects of SISMs in all skeletal muscle groups. The clinical implications of this case report include the potential role of physical therapy in monitoring and possibly facilitating the spontaneous recovery of an SISM, as well as the need to investigate the IMP of a person with dyspnea and fatigue who is taking a statin.", 
    "12": "Cardiotoxicity, which may result from intense cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation, is the main limiting factor of the anticancer therapy using doxorubicin. Because statins might exert beneficial pleiotropic cardiovascular effects, among other things, by anti-inflammatory and antioxidative mechanisms, we investigated whether or not fluvastatin pretreatment can attenuate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Five days after a single injection of doxorubicin (20 mg/kg; i.p.), left ventricular (LV) function was measured in fluvastatin-treated (DoxStatin; 100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and saline-treated (doxorubicin) mice (n = 8 per group) by a micro conductance catheter. Untreated mice served as controls (placebo; n = 8 per group). After measurement of cardiac function, LV tissues were analyzed by molecular biological and immunohistologic methods. Injection resulted in significantly impaired LV function (LV pressure, -29%; dp/dtmax, -45%; cardiac output, -68%; P < 0.05) when compared with placebo. This was associated with a significant increase in cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic mechanisms, as indicated by significant increased cardiac lipid peroxidation activity, protein expression of nitrotyrosine, tumor necrosis factor alpha and Bax (P < 0.05). In contrast, DoxStatin mice showed improved LV function (LV pressure, +24%; dp/dtmax, +87%; cardiac output, +87%; P < 0.05) when compared with untreated doxorubicin mice. This was associated with reduced cardiac expression of nitrotyrosine, enhanced expression of the mitochondrial located antioxidative SOD 2, attenuated mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, and reduced cardiac inflammatory response. Statin pretreatment attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects.", 
    "13": "Osteoprotegerin is a secretory glycoprotein. Recent experimental findings have suggested that osteoprotegerin may protect against vascular calcification and/or atherosclerosis. In humans, osteoprotegerin levels are positively correlated with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease and the progression of atherosclerosis. However, it is unclear how osteoprotegerin levels are regulated. Statins are known to have beneficial pleiotropic effects against atherosclerosis beyond their lipid-lowering effects. In this study, we examined whether treatment with pravastatin can alter osteoprotegerin levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes. Osteoprotegerin levels were significantly increased from 6.64 +/- 2.18 pmol/L at baseline to 7.08 +/- 2.29 pmol/L (P = .024) after 3-month treatment with pravastatin. These increases in osteoprotegerin levels remained after 6 months of treatment (7.05 +/- 2.22 pmol/L, P = .026). These findings suggest that pravastatin may exert its pleiotropic effects in part through alteration of osteoprotegerin levels.", 
    "14": "The normal expression of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein is critical for efficient myocardial function. The present study tested the hypothesis that rosuvastatin treatment may attenuate left ventricular (LV) remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart, which may be associated with alterations of Ca(2+)-regulatory protein.", 
    "15": "We investigated the change of LV remodelling and function in a rat model of cardiac dysfunction due to myocardial infarction (MI) with or without rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) treatment for 10 weeks. The protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA)2a, phospholamban (PLB), and phospho-PLB at serine-16 (pSer16-PLB), as well as SERCA activity, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 levels were evaluated. After rosuvastatin treatment, LV remodelling and dysfunction were prevented. Rosuvastatin prevented the decrease of SERCA2a and pSer16-PLB expression, increased SERCA activity, but showed no effect on PLB expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin reduced the increased IL-6 level and further elevated IL-10 level in the peri-infarct and remote zones of MI. Serum lipid levels remained unchanged.", 
    "16": "Rosuvastatin is effective in preventing LV remodelling and dysfunction in the failing heart. The molecular mechanism may be related to normalization of SERCA2a expression, SERCA activity, and pSer16-PLB levels, as well as through cytokine alterations independent of its lipid-lowering effect.", 
    "17": "To study the efficacy and tolerability of Daming capsule (DMC) in Chinese patients with hyperlipidemia, a randomized, multi-centre, open-label, parallel-group trial was conducted. Sixty enrolled patients with hyperlipidemia allocated to six medical centers were randomly divided into two groups of 30 individuals each. One group received DMC 2 g b.i.d. for 6 weeks, and the other received pravastatin 10 mg o.d. for 6 weeks. For efficacy assessment, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured before and after drug treatment. Serum TC and LDL-C levels in the DMC-treatment group were significantly decreased compared with those before treatment (p < 0.05), while TG and HDL-C levels did not change much. Tolerability was assessed by heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine (Cr), which were not changed in either the DMC or pravastatin groups at 3 and 6 weeks (p > 0.05). Besides, eight patients experienced diarrhea during DMC treatment and two experienced myalgia and epigastric discomfort during pravastatin treatment. Based on the above results, it was concluded that DMC may be a good candidate for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and further clinical trials are warranted.", 
    "18": "Simvaglyzin, a complex compound of simvastatin and glycyrrhizic acid, administered to rabbits with experimental hypercholesterolemiain in doses equivalent to 66.6 and 40 microg/kg simvastatin exhibited antioxidant capacity (decreased the content of lipid peroxidation products in the blood by 27-41%) and endothelium-normalizing effect (decreased the level of von Willebrand factor and endothelin-1 by 26-58 and 21-29%, respectively, compared to 200 microg/kg simvastatin, p<0.05).", 
    "19": "The cardiovascular benefits of fish-derived long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid are well established. Less studied are specific effects of individual long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Based on data from 16 published clinical trials, this review examines effects of DHA triglyceride (TG) oil derived from algae (algal-DHA) on serum TG levels and related parameters. Study populations included subjects with both normal and elevated TG levels including those with persistent hypertriglyceridemia treated with concomitant 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy. At doses of 1-2 g/d, algal-DHA significantly lowered plasma TG levels (up to 26%) either administered alone or in combination with statins. The reduction in TG levels was markedly greater in hypertriglyceridemic than in normal subjects. Algal-DHA modestly increased plasma levels of both high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The increased plasma level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was associated with a shift of lipoprotein particle size toward larger, less atherogenic subfractions. In some subjects, blood pressure and heart rate were significantly reduced. Algal-DHA was safe and well tolerated. Unlike fish oil, algal-DHA seldom caused gastrointestinal complaints such as fishy taste and eructation, attributes of importance for patient compliance in high-dose therapy. Regression analysis that showed a linear relationship between baseline TG and magnitude of TG reduction suggests that a study of patients with very high TG levels (>500 mg/dL) is warranted. Future pharmacologic therapies for treating hypertriglyceridemia may include algal-DHA.", 
    "20": "Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease after carotid endarterectomy should include management of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, but increased LDL levels are undertreated in these patients. We examined trends in statin use and LDL goal achievement in veterans undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA), a medically high-risk group with high rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The records of all CEA performed between 1995 and 2005 in the Connecticut Veterans' Affairs (VA) hospital were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze long-term outcomes. ANOVA was used for comparisons between groups. A total of 309 CEA procedures were performed in 298 patients. The mean follow-up was 4.1 years. Statin use increased over time (12% in 1995, 84% in 2005) and mean LDL levels decreased (105 mg/dl in 1997, 90 mg/dl in 2007). The number of patients achieving LDL goals of 100 mg/dl or 70 mg/dl increased. Mean HDL levels decreased (53 mg/dl in 1997 and 38 mg/dl in 2007). Patients with three or more comorbid medical conditions were more likely to achieve LDL goals. At 12 years, freedom from stroke was 91%, freedom from myocardial infarction was 46% and survival was 12%. In conclusion, over the last decade, among patients who have undergone CEA, statin use has increased and LDL levels have improved.", 
    "21": "Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide. As dyslipidemia increases cardiovascular disease risk, proper management of dyslipidemia is one means by which to decrease cardiovascular disease risk. This review focuses on dyslipidemia treatment utilizing fibrate therapy, which targets high trigylcerides, low HDL, and high small, dense LDL, while contrasting fibrate therapy with statin therapy and combined therapy. Studies were obtained using electronic search strategies, such as Medline and Cochrane Library. Sources selected were limited to those that discussed fibrates, statins, and combined therapy, with specific emphasis placed on sources that focused on fibrates. Selected studies were then assessed for quality via analysis of the study's methodology, results, and data.", 
    "22": "of selected studies were then stratified using a rating system devised to determine the quality of results using the scientific evidence provided for them. Combination fibrate and statin therapy can be more effective in achieving optimal lipid levels than just fibrate or statin therapy alone without significant side effects as long as gemfibrozil is not used in therapy.", 
    "23": "Cardiac biomarkers play an important role in heart failure. The family of natriuretic peptides, especially B-type natriuretic peptide, was identified as a valued diagnostic and prognostic tool. Not unexpectedly, the natriuretic peptides fail to fulfill all the criteria of an ideal biochemical marker. The quest for a single marker or a combination is therefore still on and several established, widely available biomarkers might have been overlooked in the field of heart failure. This review puts forward some of those biomarkers, and we speculate on the possible roles of combining two or more biomarkers. In that sense, any blood parameter including hemoglobin, cholesterol, uric acid, and recently identified proteins might function as a biomarker. Additionally, several biomarkers are discussed and we try to anticipate their diagnostic and prognostic value along with the natriuretic peptides and established biomarkers. Finally, we speculate about the potential of sharing the biomarkers over a variety of chronic diseases with similar pathophysiology.", 
    "24": "The aim of the study was to investigate the functional profile of dendritic cells in patients with coronary heart disease and the effects of pravastatin on this. Forty-eight patients with coronary heart disease were divided into three groups: 16 treated with pravastatin 10 mg/day, 16 treated with pravastatin 20 mg/day and 16 not treated with pravastatin. Dendritic cells from 48 patients with coronary heart disease (before and 4 weeks after the treatment) and 16 healthy individuals were derived from peripheral blood. CD86 of dendritic cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Immunostimulatory capacity of dendritic cells was measured by mixed lymphocyte reaction. The levels of cytokines in the medium of mixed lymphocyte reaction were analysed. Blood lipids and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured. Compared to normal group, more CD86+ dendritic cells were expressed in coronary heart disease and greater immunostimulatory capacity of dendritic cells in coronary heart disease was demonstrated. T lymphocytes in coronary heart disease in mixed lymphocyte reaction secreted higher levels of pro-inflammation cytokines and lower levels of anti-inflammation cytokines. CD86 expression significantly correlated with C-reactive protein, but did not correlate with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Both dosages of pravastatin markedly inhibited the function of dendritic cells and lowered C-reactive protein, which is independent of plasma cholesterol lowering. The anti-inflammatory effect of pravastatin showed no obvious difference between the two dosage groups. In conclusion, dendritic cells were activated in coronary heart disease and dendritic cell-mediated immune mechanisms may be involved in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease. Pravastatin can inhibit dendritic cell activation, which is independent of plasma cholesterol lowering. Pravastatin in different doses showed no apparent differences in the inhibition of dendritic cell functions.", 
    "25": "On the basis of large randomized trials, current guidelines recommend to treat all patients with type 2 diabetes or coronary artery disease after myocardial infarction with statin drugs. However, the recent 4D, CORONA and GISSI-HF trials show that old patients with ischemic heart failure and patients with diabetes and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis do not benefit from new onset of statin therapy with regard to mortality. The survival benefit from statin therapy appears to stem primarily from the prevention of progression of coronary artery disease. In clinical conditions where coronary artery disease does not significantly contribute to the cause of death, statins seem to be less effective. In patients at risk of organ damage, statin therapy therefore has to be initiated early in the course of the disease. The effect of statin withdrawal in ischemic heart failure or in patients with advanced renal disease is not known and potentially harmful and therefore, on the basis of the available evidence, ongoing statin treatment should not be stopped in these patients.", 
    "26": "Diabetes is a complex disorder characterized by impaired insulin formation, release or action (insulin resistance), elevated blood glucose, and multiple long-term complications. It is a common endocrine disorder of humans and is associated with abnormalities of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. There are two forms of diabetes, classified as type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, hyperglycemia is due to an absolute lack of insulin, whereas in type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia is due to a relative lack of insulin and insulin resistance. More than 90% of people with diabetes have type 2 with varied degrees of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is often associated with impaired insulin secretion, and hyperglycemia is a common feature in both types of diabetes, but failure to make a distinction between the types of diabetes in different animal models has led to confusion in the literature. This is particularly true in relation to cardiovascular disease in the presence of diabetes and especially the response to vascular injury, in which there are major differences between the two types of diabetes. Animal models do not completely mimic the clinical disease seen in humans. Animal models are at best analogies of the pathologic process they are designed to represent. The focus of this review is an analysis of intimal hyperplasia following catheter-induced vascular injury, including factors that may complicate comparisons between different animal models or between in vitro and in vivo studies. We examine the variables, pitfalls, and caveats that follow from the manner of induction of the injury and the diabetic state of the animal. The efficacy of selected antidiabetic drugs in inhibiting the development of the hyperplastic response is also discussed.", 
    "27": "Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from 1-arginine by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). NO participates in regulation of physiologically important cardiovascular functions (contractive reduction of heart, cellular proliferation, a tone of vessels and blood pressure), immunity, and nervous systems. Inflammation factors, hypoxia, lipids affect NO synthesis. Intensity of eNOS gene transcription depends on polymorphic alleles of eNOS gene, posttranscriptional mechanisms providing mRNA stability. All these factors have effects on development of cardiovascular events.", 
    "28": "Although a low level of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease, few available agents are capable of significantly increasing HDL-C. This multicenter study demonstrated that administration of pitavastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, significantly and persistently increased HDL-C (from 36.0+/-5.9 to 40.5+/-9.1 mg/dL: p<0.001) and apolipoprotein A-I levels (from 108.4+/-18.0 to 118.7+/-19.3 mg/dL: p<0.01) in 43 hypercholesterolemic patients with low HDL-C over the course of 12 months of treatment. This suggests that pitavastatin may contribute to reduction in coronary heart disease.",

Patients with either a primary or secondary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome were identified from medical records over a 4-month period (January-April 2007). A range of clinical data was extracted from medical records, including medical history, clinical presentation and pharmacotherapy both on admission and at discharge. This audit focussed on the use of four guideline-recommended therapies: aspirin +/- clopidogrel, beta blockers, statins and ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I), as well as the utilization of multiple antithrombotics.", 
    "35": "Data pertaining to a total of 169 patients was extracted and reviewed. The mean age of the study population was 65.9 years and 71% of the population was male. Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (Non-STEMI) accounted for 42% of the admissions, whereas 33.7% and 24.3% of the patients were respectively admitted for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or unstable angina. After accounting for reported contra-indications, overall, 96% of the eligible patients received antithrombotics comprising of at least aspirin, and 79% of eligible patients received aspirin plus clopidogrel. Furthermore, 82% of eligible patients received a beta-blocker at discharge, 86% a statin and 79% received either an ACE-I or angiotensin-II receptor antagonist. Compared with patients who presented with myocardial infarction (with or without ST-segment elevation), those presenting with unstable angina were less likely to receive a beta-blocker (OR = 0.19, 95%-CI: 0.08-0.48) or an ACE-agent (OR = 0.15, 95%-CI: 0.06-0.39) at discharge.

All three animal groups were subjected to restraint stress on day 10 and to infusions of isoprenaline (ISO; 1 mg/kg x day) or NaCl via minipumps for the last 4 days. Heart rate was measured by telemetry, left ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) transcript levels by RT-PCR, and left atrial contractile function in organ baths. Heart rate was similar in all six study groups. In animals pre-treated with water, infusion of ISO induced an increase in heart-to-body weight ratio (HW/BW) by approximately 20%, an increase in ANP mRNA by approximately 350%, and a reduction in the inotropic effect of isoprenaline in left atrium by approximately 50%. In animals pre-treated with high-dose atorvastatin, the effects of ISO on HW/BW, ANP, and left atrial force were approximately 40, 50, and 40% smaller, respectively. Low dose atorvastatin had similar, albeit smaller effects. Atorvastatin treatment of NaCl-infused rats had only marginal effects.

The decreased arachidonic acid release was not reversed by addition of either intermediate products during cholesterol synthesis, such as mevalonate, geranylgeraniol, farnesol, or cholesterol and lipoprotein although a reduced concentration of cholesterol in the cells, caused by lovastatin, was reversed by added cholesterol. Lovastatin, furthermore, diminished prostacyclin production and inhibited activity of cyclooxygenase-1. 27-Hydroxycholesterol (27OHC), an oxidized cholesterol, had the same effect on HMG-CoA reductase as lovastatin, but 27OHC increased arachidonic acid release and (45)Ca(2+) influx.

Fasting lipid profile was taken when patients were treated with diet, diet plus 80 mg of fluvastatin and diet plus fluvastatin 80 mg and 4 g of prescription omega 3 fatty acids. The intestinal lipoproteins were quantified by the fasting concentration of apolipoprotein B48 using a commercial ELISA.", 
    "47": "The addition of 4 g of prescription omega 3 was followed by significant reductions in the levels of triglycerides, VLDL triglycerides and the triglyceride/HDL cholesterol ratio, and an increase in HDL cholesterol (P < 0.05). Fluvastatin induced a reduction of 26% in B100 (P < 0.05) and 14% in B48 (NS). However, the addition of omega 3 fatty acids enhanced this reduction to 32% in B100 (NS) and up to 36% in B48 (P < 0.05).", 
    "48": "Our preliminary findings therefore suggest an additional benefit on postprandial atherogenic particles when omega 3 fatty acids are added to standard treatment with fluvastatin.", 
    "49": "Elevated plasma concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), also named serpin E1, are encountered in patients with thrombophilia, atherosclerosis, septicemia and the metabolic syndrome and may be associated with an increased risk of complications. Expression of PAI-1 is increased by inflammatory stimuli and decreased by statins, drugs widely used in patients with cardiovascular disease. Increased expression of PAI-1 by inflammatory stimuli is mediated by a large variety of signal transduction pathways, which include the NF-kappaB and MAP kinase pathways. The downregulating effect of statins on PAI-1 expression is dependent on the inhibition of Rho family proteins and may involve an activation of PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathways. In this review we summarize the findings on the effect of inflammation and statins on PAI-1 expression.", 
    "50": "In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins may reduce platelet activity and exert beneficial non-lipid (pleiotropic) effects. We evaluated the effects of two different simvastatin based treatment regimens on platelet reactivity in patients with dysglycemia and coronary artery disease (CAD). Thirty-two patients with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance and stable CAD received six weeks of double-blind treatment with simvastatin 80 mg daily (S80; n = 16) or ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 10 mg daily (E10/S10; n = 16). Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) decreased similarly in the two groups. LDL (mM) decreased from 3.2 +/- 0.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.7 with E10/S10 and from 3.0 +/- 1.0 to 1.4 +/- 0.5 with S80 treatment. Platelet function was evaluated by whole blood flow cytometry and turbidimetric aggregometry with agonist stimulation ex vivo before and after treatment. Neither treatment affected basal or adenosine diphosphate (ADP)- or thrombin-induced platelet P-selectin expression, or fibrinogen binding, or platelet-leukocyte aggregation. Similarly, neither treatment affected ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In conclusion, lipid lowering treatment with high dose simvastatin or low dose simvastatin plus ezetimibe did not exert any substantial inhibitory effects on the basal or agonist-stimulated activity of circulating platelets in patients with stable CAD and type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.", 
    "51": "Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) plays a central role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis by controlling NO bioavailability. The activity of eNOS in vascular endothelial cells (ECs) largely depends on posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation. Because the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in ECs can be increased by multiple cardiovascular events, we studied the phosphorylation of eNOS Ser633 by AMPK and examined its functional relevance in the mouse models. Shear stress, atorvastatin, and adiponectin all increased AMPK Thr172 and eNOS Ser633 phosphorylations, which were abolished if AMPK was pharmacologically inhibited or genetically ablated. The constitutively active form of AMPK or an AMPK agonist caused a sustained Ser633 phosphorylation. Expression of gain-/loss-of-function eNOS mutants revealed that Ser633 phosphorylation is important for NO production. The aorta of AMPKalpha2(-/-) mice showed attenuated atorvastatin-induced eNOS phosphorylation. Nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) confirmed that eNOS Ser633 was able to compete with Ser1177 or acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase Ser79 for AMPKalpha phosphorylation. Nano-LC/MS/MS confirmed that eNOS purified from AICAR-treated ECs was phosphorylated at both Ser633 and Ser1177. Our results indicate that AMPK phosphorylation of eNOS Ser633 is a functional signaling event for NO bioavailability in ECs.", 
    "52": "Statins exert multiple effects besides lowering the serum cholesterol level, which might be beneficial for patients with sepsis and infections. We designed this study to assess the therapeutic potential of simvastatin in an established animal model of pneumococcal meningitis, a disease characterized by high morbidity and mortality despite effective antibiotic treatment. 24 h after injection of live pneumococci into the cisterna magna of mice, animals were clinically evaluated, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte counts and intracranial pressure were determined, and brains were removed for assessment of bacterial titer and blood-brain barrier breakdown. The following experimental groups were investigated: (I) no infection and treatment with vehicle; (II) infection and treatment with vehicle; infection and treatment with (III) 20 mg/kg or (IV) 40 mg/kg simvastatin s.c. 18 h before and just prior to infection. Treatment with simvastatin dose-dependently decreased CSF leukocyte counts, a marker for CNS inflammation. In addition, hypothermia was completely abolished in the 40 mg/kg simvastatin group. In contrast, a neurological clinical score, and intracranial complications like increase in intracranial pressure and blood-brain barrier breakdown were not altered by the treatment. In conclusion, simvastatin attenuates CNS leukocyte recruitment and systemic complications of experimental pneumococcal meningitis.", 
    "53": "The effect of two different doses (1 microg Se/Kg and 50 microg Se/Kg Body wt) of selenium on nicotine induced hyperlipidemia was investigated in rats. Results revealed that nicotine intake caused an increase in concentration of cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, phospholipids and low density lipoprotein compared to control group. Coadministration of selenium along with nicotine reduced the levels of lipids compared to nicotine group. This reduction was due to reduction in the biosynthesis of lipids as evidenced by the reduced activity of HMGCoA reductase and lipogenic enzymes. Nicotine intake also reduced the absorption of selenium in the intestine. Histopathological studies revealed that selenium at a dose of 1 microg was more effective in reducing lipid levels and higher dose of selenium was toxic.", 
    "54": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are safe and well-tolerated therapeutic drugs. However, they occasionally induce myotoxicity such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Here, we investigated the mechanism of statin-induced myotoxicity in L6 fibroblasts and in rats in vivo. L6 fibroblasts were differentiated and then treated with pravastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin for 72 h. Hydrophobic simvastatin and fluvastatin decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner via apoptosis characterized by typical nuclear fragmentation and condensation and caspase-3 activation. Both hydrophobic statins transferred RhoA localization from the cell membrane to the cytosol. These changes induced by both hydrophobic statins were completely abolished by the co-application of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP). Y27632, a Rho-kinase inhibitor, mimicked the hydrophobic statin-induced apoptosis. Hydrophilic pravastatin did not affect the viability of the cells. Fluvastatin was continuously infused (2.08 mg/kg at an infusion rate of 0.5 mL/h) into the right internal jugular vein of the rats in vivo for 72 h. Fluvastatin infusion significantly elevated the plasma CPK level and transferred RhoA localization in the skeletal muscle from the cell membrane to the cytosol. In conclusion, RhoA dysfunction due to loss of lipid modification with GGPP is involved in the mechanisms of statin-induced skeletal muscle toxicity.", 
    "55": "Statins enhance the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) from their precursors both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, an increased conversion of linoleic acid (LA) and of alpha-linolenic acid to their derivatives is observed in cultured cells. On the contrary, cigarette smoke (CS) negatively and dose-dependently affects the LC-PUFA production.", 
    "56": "To evaluate the effects of CS alone or with simvastatin, on [1-(14)C] LA metabolism in THP-1 cells.", 
    "57": "CS inhibits LA conversion; after co-incubation, simvastatin nullifies the effects of CS, maintaining LA conversion comparable to controls. However, at the highest CS concentration, simvastatin is unable to counteract the effects of CS. Changes of LA conversion reflect the modulation of desaturase activities by simvastatin and CS.", 
    "58": "CS decreases PUFA conversion and its effects are modulated by the opposite effect of statins. It can be speculated that statin treatments in smoking patients may provide some beneficial effects on PUFA metabolism in addition to lowering cholesterol levels.",

Total and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were determined by enzymatic methods; non-HDL-C was calculated by subtracting HDL-C from total cholesterol; and atherosclerosis was presented as the percentage of lesion area, relative to the total area from the aorta segment analyzed.", 
    "62": "Simvastatin significantly reduced the tot cholesterol (16%) and non-HDL-C level (17%) and increased the HDL-C (98%), compared to group H. E. faecium raised the HDL-C level by 43.3% (P < 0.05). Isoflavone decreased the total cholesterol and non-HDL-C concentrations (9%), but this effect was not statistically significant. At the end of the treatments, groups HE and HS had significantly lower levels of triglycerides in relation to H and HI. The atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic arch was not different between groups. The extent of atherosclerosis in the thoracic and abdominal aorta was reduced in the groups HI and HS by 22.7% and 26.7% respectively, but this effect was not significant (P > 0.05).", 
    "63": "The results indicated that probiotic microorganism E. faecium CRL 183 could be used to improve the lipid profile as an alternative or an adjuvant for drug therapy. The effectiveness of simvastatin in the management of blood lipid was confirmed. There were no effects of soy isoflavones, E. faecium and simvastatin on atherosclerosis development.", 
    "64": "X-Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a peroxisomal disorder characterized by accumulation of very-long-chain (VLC) fatty acids, which induces inflammatory disease and alterations in cellular redox, both of which are reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of the severe form of the disease (childhood cerebral ALD). Here, we report on the status of oxidative stress (NADPH oxidase activity) and inflammatory mediators in an X-ALD lymphoblast cell line under nonstimulated conditions. X-ALD lymphoblasts contain nearly 7 times higher levels of the C(26:0) fatty acid compared to controls; these levels were downregulated by treatment with sodium phenylacetate (NaPA), lovastatin or the combination of both drugs. In addition, free-radicals synthesis was elevated in X-ALD lymphoblasts, and protein levels of the NADPH oxidase gp91(PHOX) membrane subunit were significantly upregulated, but no changes were observed in the p47(PHOX) and p67(PHOX) cytoplasmic subunits. Unexpectedly, there was no increase in gp91(PHOX) mRNA levels in X-ALD lymphoblasts. Furthermore, X-ALD lymphoblasts produced higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 1 beta), and treatment with NaPA or lovastatin decreased the synthesis of NO. Our data indicate that X-ALD lymphoblasts are significantly affected by the accumulation of VLC fatty acids, which induces changes in the cell membrane properties/functions that may, in turn, play a role in the development/progression of the pathogenesis of X-ALD disease.",

Low HDL-C was independently associated with CVD [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.46, 95% CI: 1.22-1.74, p < 0.001]. The prevalence of CVD was higher as HDL-C concentration was lower (chi-square trend < 0.001).

However, despite the evidence highlighted in this review demonstrating that older patients can safely achieve substantial benefit from statin therapy, studies have consistently shown an inverse relationship between age and treatment propensity. Often, older patients have multiple risk factors and many chronic comorbid conditions that seem to complicate and hinder treatment in many busy clinic practices. More extensive guidelines for the use of statin therapy in older patients, incorporating recommendations for treatment targets and developing a framework for the use of statins in stroke prevention, would assist care providers in the management of this high-risk population.

At week 4, additional antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication was permitted. The primary end point was the proportion of patients in whom the dual goal of blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control (<100 mg/dL) was met at week 4. This dual goal attainment was significantly greater with amlodipine/atorvastatin plus TLC compared with placebo plus TLC at week 4 (47.6% vs 1.7%; P<.001), with further improvements at week 8.

The main results are as follows. (1) Majority of statins enhanced PPARalpha promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in HepG2 cells transfected with the human PPARalpha promoter. This enhancement may be mediated by statin-induced HNF-4alpha. (2) PPARalpha mRNA expression was increased by statin treatment. (3) The PPARalpha levels in nuclear fractions were increased by statin treatment. (4) Simvastatin, pravastatin, and cerivastatin markedly enhanced transcriptional activity in 293T cells cotransfected with acyl-coenzyme A oxidase promoter and PPARalpha/RXRalpha expression vectors. In summary, these data demonstrate that PPARalpha production and activation are upregulated through the PPARalpha promoter activity by statin treatment.",

Although cardiovascular risk is multifactorial, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels contribute to risk even in old age. Despite the importance of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with statins to reduce cardiovascular events, specific evidence and recommendations for older populations are limited. Where evidence supports lipid lowering in older adults, provider and patient adherence to statins remains suboptimal. Paradoxically, risk is an inverse driver of statin use regardless of age, with those most likely to benefit being least likely to receive them.

The hope is therefore, that we someday in the management of patients with calcific AS can apply some of the same treatment strategies as in atherosclerotic vascular disease. This article reviews the pathophysiological mechanisms of calcific AS, reviews current clinical trials of statin use in aortic stenosis and reports on on-going trials, evaluating whether cholesterol lowering therapy can slow disease progression in different populations.

These drugs reduce cholesterol levels, which have been related to a reduction in vascular event risk, but they also have other functions besides cholesterol metabolism, called pleiotropic effects. Statins play an important role during the acute phase of ischemia, and might have neuroprotective effects, as they act in several mechanisms during the acute phase of stroke, such as in nitric oxide (NO) and glutamate metabolism, inflammation, platelet aggregation, immune responses and apoptosis. They also have other functions that can be related, with better long-term outcome, to neurorepair mechanisms.

Periprocedural myocardial infarction and contrast induced nephropathy, after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), are associated with a worse outcome on long term follow-up. In the ARMYDA study, pretreatment with statins before elective PCI reduces periprocedural myocardial infarction in patients with stable angina. Moreover, the ARMYDA ACS was the first randomized, prospective trial that demonstrated that an acute loading with a high dose of atorvastatin prevents myocardial damage in patients with unstable syndromes undergoing early (<48 hours) coronary angiography and consequent angioplasty. Statins could also have beneficial effects by reducing expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial cells (ICAM-1 and E-Selectin) as demonstrated in the ARMYDA-CAMS study.

Patients with low HDL-C are also at an amplified risk of coronary heart disease due to the common coexistence of other risk factors, including excess adiposity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, and the atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by small dense LDL-C. First-line therapy of low HDL-C generally consists of nonpharmacologic measures such as improved fitness and weight loss. Current pharmaceutical options include statins, fibrates, and nicotinic acid.

After 8 weeks, oral administration of either Mevalotin or Mevan was started at the dose of 30 mg pravastatin/day for 16 weeks. After a transient increase for a few weeks, the plasma levels of total- and LDL-cholesterol gradually decreased in Mevalotingroup, whereas these levels did not significantly changed in Mevan group within 16 weeks. The level of HDL-cholesterol in Mevan group tended to increase but not in Mevalotin group. The triglyceride level in Mevan group changed as well as that in Mevalotin group until 10 weeks after administration, and then gradually increased. The present results suggest that pharmaceutical properties of Mevan are not always identical with those of Mevalotin.",

Pretreatment of oxLDL-exposed cells with statins reduced the above mentioned histone modification, as well as recruitment of CREB binding protein (CBP) 300, NF-kappaB, and of RNA polymerase II but prevented loss of binding of histone deacetylase (HDAC)-1 and -2 at the il8 and mcp1 gene promoters. OxLDL reduced HDAC1 and 2 expression, and statins partly restored global HDAC-activity. Statin-related effects were reverted with mevalonate.

In subjects with normal kidney function, the control of classic, Framingham-type, risk factors (blood pressure, glycemia, lipids, smoking) reduces impressively the burden of cardiovascular disease. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), prevention is based on similar strategies in general and on reduction of proteinuria (blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [RAAS], salt restriction) in particular. Although several nontraditional risk factors are recognized already in early stages of CKD (stages 1 and 2), they become more prominent in stages 3 to 5, most likely responsible for a different pathology. In fact, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality increase dramatically from CKD stage 3b (glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.72 m2) to stage 5, and the pattern of cardiac and vascular damage changes profoundly. It appears that arteriosclerosis is recognized more often than atherosclerosis, and left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiac fibrosis is prominent. Randomized controlled trials in advanced CKD and stage 5D using strategies targeting classic risk factors indicate that treatments are not as effective as in subjects with normal kidney function. Whether late stages of CKD or a risk pattern dominated by nonclassic risk factors need a different or an additional approach or whether we can use biomarkers to detect the turning point is currently a matter of intense discussion among nephrologists and clinical scientists.", 
    "116": "Beyond lipid-lowering effects, statins have favorable effects on platelets, endothelial function, plaque stability, and inflammation. These \"pleiotropic\" effects could contribute to microvascular function preservation during ischemia. Data are limited about the impact of previous treatment with statins on outcomes of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Accordingly, the aim was to evaluate the effect of previous statin treatment on clinical outcomes of such patients. A total of 950 consecutive patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI who were included in our primary PCI registry from January 2001 to July 2007 were studied. Excluded were patients with cardiogenic shock. Patients were allocated into 2 groups: those who received previous statin treatment (n=327) and those who did not (n=623). Patients who received previous statin treatment were older and more likely to be women; have diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and anemia; or have had a previous myocardial infarction. Procedural characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Despite the higher risk profile, patients who received previous statin treatment had a lower 30-day mortality rate (1.5% vs 3.8%; p=0.05). However, at 6 months, mortality differences were no longer evident and patients who received previous statin therapy had a higher rate of target-vessel revascularization (12.4% vs 7.6%; p=0.02). Multivariate analysis showed that previous statin treatment was associated with an odds ratio of 0.4 (95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.96, p=0.045) for 30-day mortality. In conclusion, the present study suggested that previous therapy with statins in patients with STEMI treated using primary PCI may be associated with reduced short-term mortality.",

    "118": "Many clinical studies have shown that baseline levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in apparently healthy men and women are highly predictive of future risk of heart attack, stroke, sudden cardiac death, and the development of peripheral arterial disease. This paper presents an analysis of the baseline characteristics of our prospective study cohort. The intent of our prospective study is to determine whether hsCRP can be used to better classify risk for life insurance applicants already at risk for cardiovascular events, as well as those who are not. The possibility that low levels of hsCRP levels in otherwise healthy applicants might be associated with more favorable cardiovascular risk could allow this test to be used to more precisely stratify risk in the standard-or-better underwriting classifications. In this preliminary analysis, high sensitivity CRP appears to be weakly correlated with BMI, and perhaps triglyceride level in this cohort of insurance applicants. Somewhat surprisingly, in contrast to many published reports, hsCRP was not found to be correlated with other lipid measures (TC, HDL, LDL), dysmetabolic markers or smoking classification during the underwriting process. We plan to analyze mortality results as they evolve in the future.",

This investigation assessed and described the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and treatment patterns for hypercholesterolemia in patients with atherosclerosis who were treated in routine clinical practice. This retrospective database study used a random sample (1 million patients) from a national outpatient electronic medical record database (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) and included patients with a diagnostic code for atherosclerosis (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-9 code of 440.xx or 414.x or 437.x) between January 2004 and March 2006. Use of hypercholesterolemia medications at the time ICD codes for atherosclerosis were recorded and thereafter was documented. Patient demographics, comorbid conditions, baseline LDL cholesterol (closest value within 6 months of the diagnosis date), and follow-up LDL cholesterol (after diagnosis) were also documented. A total of 10,637 eligible patients had an ICD diagnostic code for atherosclerosis. Most patients (61.3%) were not taking any dyslipidemia medication at the time of and after atherosclerosis diagnosis. A total of 3% were prescribed therapy with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) before the time of atherosclerosis diagnosis, and 25% were prescribed a statin after diagnosis. Approximately 62% of patients with atherosclerosis did not have a baseline LDL cholesterol estimate. Of patients with LDL cholesterol recorded at diagnosis (n = 4,067), 24% had LDL cholesterol > or = 130 mg/dL (1 mg/dL = 0.02586 mmol/L), 53% had LDL cholesterol > or = 100 mg/dL, and 87% had LDL cholesterol > or = 70 mg/dL. Among patients with LDL cholesterol > or = 100 mg/dL at diagnosis, 57% were not prescribed statin treatment after diagnosis.

    "120": "Atherosclerosis causes nearly 75% of cardiovascular-related deaths and is found in 80% to 90% of adults >/=30 years old in the United States. Successful treatment minimizes lifetime chances of cardiovascular events, morbidity, and mortality. Risk factors for atherosclerosis should be monitored, beginning in childhood, even in asymptomatic patients. Modifiable factors (e.g., blood pressure, smoking, serum lipids) and nonmodifiable factors (e.g., age, family history) are important in the overall assessment. Clinicians and patients can partner to produce an individualized treatment plan by choosing from a variety of standard approaches. In some patients, improved dietary choices, increased exercise, and smoking cessation will reduce risk to an acceptable degree. To lower risk further, lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy and antihypertensive medication may be combined with these lifestyle improvements. For most of these patients, reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is the most important lipid-lowering goal, and it is best achieved with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin). Some patients may benefit from adjunctive therapies that have proven effects (e.g., niacin, fibrates, plant stanols/sterols, omega-3 fatty acids). Antihypertensive regimens may involve stepwise adjustments of multiple medications. Good clinical judgment and communication of expectations and goals are critical for effective management of atherosclerosis.", 
    "121": "Atherosclerosis develops over the course of 50 years, beginning in the early teenage years. The causes of this process appear to be lipid retention, oxidation, and modification, which provoke chronic inflammation at susceptible sites in the walls of all major conduit arteries. Initial fatty streaks evolve into fibrous plaques, some of which develop into forms that are vulnerable to rupture, causing thrombosis or stenosis. Erosion of the surfaces of some plaques and rupture of a plaque's calcific nodule into the artery lumen also may trigger thrombosis. The process of plaque development is the same regardless of race/ethnicity, sex, or geographic location, apparently worldwide. However, the rate of development is faster in patients with risk factors such as hypertension, tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and genetic predisposition. Clinical trial data demonstrate that treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) favorably alters plaque size, cellular composition, chemical composition, and biological activities centered on inflammation and cholesterol metabolism, as well as the risk of clinical events due to atherosclerosis. Even with advanced atherosclerosis, statins begin to improve clinical risk within 4 months. During long-term follow-up in clinical trials for up to 11 years with or without further treatment, clinical benefit remains significant, indicating the durability of treatment-induced changes in the development of plaque. Thus, atherosclerosis, a disease heretofore viewed as inevitably progressive, can be treated to significantly alter arterial lesions and reduce their clinical consequences.",

Epidemiologic studies suggest that elevated mid-life plasma cholesterol levels may be associated with an increased risk of AD and that statin use may reduce the prevalence of AD. Cellular studies have shown that the levels and distribution of intracellular cholesterol markedly affect the processing of amyloid precursor protein into A beta peptides, which are the toxic species that accumulate as amyloid plaques in the AD brain. Most importantly, genetic evidence identifies apolipoprotein E, the major cholesterol carrier in the central nervous system, as the primary genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. In humans, apoE exists as three major alleles (apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4), and inheritance of the apoE4 allele increases the risk of developing AD at an earlier age. However, exactly how apoE functions in the pathogenesis of AD remains to be fully determined. Our studies have identified that the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 is a crucial regulator of apoE levels and lipidation in the brain. Deficiency of ABCA1 leads to the loss of approximately 80% of apoE in the brain, and the residual 20% that remains is poorly lipidated. Several independent studies have shown this poorly lipidated apoE increases amyloid burden in mouse models of AD, demonstrating that apoE lipidation by ABCA1 affects key steps in amyloid deposition or clearance. Conversely, robust overexpression of ABCA1 in the brain promotes apoE lipidation and nearly eliminates the formation of mature amyloid plaques. These studies show that the lipid binding capacity of apoE is a major mechanism of its function in the pathogenesis of AD, and suggest that increasing apoE lipidation may be of therapeutic importance for this devastating disease.",

The trial demonstrated that treatment with statin was associated with significant lowering of hsCRP (37%), with 44% reduction in incident CV and 20% reduction in all-cause mortality.

They thus affect the small GTPase Rho, which requires attachment to cell membranes for proper signaling activity. Chimaerins are GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that accelerate GTP hydrolysis from Rac, another GTPase of the same family. We explored the cooperative antitumor effects of the overexpression of \u03b22-chimaerin in combination with statins. F3II mouse mammary carcinoma cells transfected with the \u03b22-chimaerin GAP domain exhibiting low intracellular levels of active Rac-GTP were exposed in vitro to a panel of statins. Transfectants were significantly more sensitive to the cytostatic effects of lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin than untransfected F3II cells with high Rac-GTP levels. Transfected tumor cells also showed a higher sensitivity for detachment from the substrate and for apoptosis after statin exposure. We further checked the cytostatic effect of statins in combination with azathioprine, a compound that specifically blocks Rac1 activation. Combined treatment with simvastatin and azathioprine demonstrated an enhanced growth-inhibitory effect on control F3II cells. Our data suggest that the combination of statins with a reduction in active Rac levels can produce a cooperative antitumor effect on breast cancer cells.",

The advent of colesevelam in 2000 provided a more tolerable add-on LDL-C-lowering agent with an excellent safety record and with likely benefit for coronary heart disease events. Colesevelam lowers LDL-C approximately 15%, and has an additive effect when combined with statin or non-statin lipid-modifying agents. It also tends to increase triglyceride levels. The discovery that bile sequestrants also lower glucose levels led to definitive large-scale clinical trials testing the effect of colesevelam as a dual antihyperglycemic agent with LDL-C-lowering properties in type 2 diabetic subjects on metformin-, sulfonylurea- or insulin-based therapy with inadequate glycemic control. Colesevelam was found to lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) by approximately 0.5% compared to placebo over the 16- to 26-week period, and had similar effects on the lipid profile in these diabetic subjects, as had previously been demonstrated in non-diabetic individuals. Colesevelam was well tolerated, with constipation being the most common adverse effect, and did not cause weight gain or excessive hypoglycemia. Colesevelam thus combines antihyperglycemic action with LDL-C-lowering properties, and should be useful in the management of type 2 diabetes."
