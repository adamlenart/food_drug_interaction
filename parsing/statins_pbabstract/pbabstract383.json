    "0": "The main effect of simvastatin is the decrease of serum cholesterol due to the reduction of LDL. A decrease of serum triglycerides and an increase of HDL-C are commonly observed during the treatment. The reduction of triglycerides is accounted for by the increased catabolism of apo B-containing lipoproteins whereas the mechanisms bringing about the increase of HDL-C are still unknown. We treated 318 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (227 with phenotype IIa and 91 with phenotype IIb) with simvastatin 10 mg a day and after 6 weeks we found a mean 3% increase in HDL-C. HDL-C increased only in about half of the patients and the patients in whom HDL-C increased had baseline higher serum triglycerides and had a greater hypotriglyceridemic response than patients in whom HDL-C did not increase. Accordingly, HDL-C increased in type IIb patients who experienced a greater change in triglycerides than type IIa patients, in whom HDL-C did not increase significantly. Apo A-I levels did not change and apo A-I/HDL-C ratio significantly decreased. At a daily dose of 40 mg, administered to 51 treatment-resistant patients, simvastatin produced a marginally greater decrease in serum cholesterol and LDL-C, but not in serum triglycerides and HDL-C, than at the daily dose of 10 mg. An increase in HDL-C was associated with a reduction in serum triglycerides. The decrease in apo A-I/HDL-C ratio suggests that the increase in HDL-C after simvastatin must be regarded as an enrichment of the cholesterol core of HDL particles. The effect is likely to be due to the decrease of the serum concentration of VLDL bringing about a reduction of cholesterol transfer from apo A-I to apo B-containing lipoproteins.", 
    "1": "1. Statins inhibit synthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of ubiquinone that is a central compound of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The main adverse effect of statins is a toxic myopathy possibly related to mitochondrial dysfunction. 2. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of lipid-lowering drugs on ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) serum level and on mitochondrial function assessed by blood lactate/pyruvate ratio. 3. Eighty hypercholesterolaemic patients (40 treated by statins, 20 treated by fibrates, and 20 untreated patients, all 80 having total cholesterol levels > 6.0 mmol l-1) and 20 healthy controls were included. Ubiquinone serum level and blood lactate/pyruvate ratio used as a test for mitochondrial dysfunction were evaluated in all subjects. 4. Lactate/pyruvate ratios were significantly higher in patients treated by statins than in untreated hypercholesterolaemic patients or in healthy controls (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001). The difference was not significant between fibratetreated patients and untreated patients. 5. Ubiquinone serum levels were lower in statin-treated patients (0.75 mg l-1 +/- 0.04) than in untreated hypercholesterolaemic patients (0.95 mg l-1 +/- 0.09; P < 0.05). 6. We conclude that statin therapy can be associated with high blood lactate/ pyruvate ratio suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction. It is uncertain to what extent low serum levels of ubiquinone could explain the mitochondrial dysfunction.", 
    "2": "In eight patients with familial hypercholesterolemia the effects of two lipid reducing drugs on subpopulations of high density lipoproteins (HDL) were examined. After a 14-week period of diet and diet/placebo a 12-week therapy followed with either bezafibrate (CAS 41859-67-0) or fluvastatin (CAS 93957-55-2). Throughout both treatments a significant decrease of total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglycerides during both therapies were noted as well as an insignificant increase of HDL-cholesterol during bezafibrate. The nondenaturating gradient gel electrophoresis is a valid method for the investigation of the behaviour of HDL and was therefore chosen for this investigation. The individual HDL pattern and HDL diameters did not change in these subjects. The effect on the amounts of HDL 3b and HDL 3c was significantly more extensive during fluvastatin (+2.4% resp. + 2.9%) as compared to during bezafibrate therapy (+1.7% resp. + 2.9%). The changes noted in the HDL subclasses are probably due to a variable lipoprotein metabolism, for example increased activity of lipoprotein lipase, hepatic triglyceride lipase, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and cholesterol ester transfer protein.", 
    "3": "Although thrombolytic drugs, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass grafting have provided major advances in the treatment of coronary artery disease, the use of lipid-lowering drugs for secondary prevention has significantly reduced cardiovascular events in the population with coronary artery disease. Secondary prevention trials using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors include the Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS), the Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study (MARS), the Canadian Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial (CCAIT), the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study (ACAPS), the Multi Anti-Atheroma Study (MAAS), the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), the Pravastatin Limitation of Atherosclerosis in Coronary Arteries (PLAC I), the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS), the Pravastatin Multinational Study, and the Pravastatin, Lipids, and Atherosclerosis in Carotids (PLAC II). Mean changes from baseline of lipid fractions in these trials included: total cholesterol 18 to 35% reduction; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 26 to 46% reduction; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 5 to 15% increase; and triglyceride 7 to 22% reduction. Angiographic regression or lack of progression was statistically demonstrated in the FATS, MARS, CCAIT, MAAS, PLAC I, and REGRESS trials. Cardiovascular events decreased 25 to 92% in all trials, and there was a significant reduction in both cardiovascular and total mortality in the 4S. The greater reduction in cardiovascular events than in anatomic changes suggests that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors stabilized the surface of plaques. Monotherapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors provides the clinical opportunity to modify the natural history of coronary artery disease.", 
    "4": "Fourteen patients with familial hypercholesterolemia treated with lovastatin (40 mg/day) for three months were studied to find out whether the expected changes in plasma lipids are accompanied by modifications in the lipid composition of the erythrocyte membrane and whether these in turn induce changes in the rheological behavior of the red blood cell. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of lovastatin in reducing the plasma concentration of cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. The changes observed in the plasma lipids correlate with a significant decrease in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of the red blood cell membrane, from 1.19 +/- 0.19 in a basal situation to 0.92 +/- 0.23 (p < 0.01) at the end of treatment. These changes in the lipid composition of the cell are statistically related to a decrease in erythrocyte aggregability and an improvement in blood filterability, which means beneficial change in the patients' hemorheological situation.", 
    "5": "Hyperlipidemia occurs frequently after heart transplantation, and accelerated coronary artery disease remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients who survive more than 1 year after heart transplantation. However, the risks and benefits of lipid-lowering therapy after heart transplantation remain poorly defined, and national guidelines for lipid-lowering drug therapy do not specifically address treatment of dyslipidemia in transplant recipients. Since the initial reports in the 1980s of rhabdomyolysis in heart transplant patients receiving high-dosage lovastatin, results of 11 post-transplantation series that used lovastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin at lower dosages as drug monotherapy have been published. These studies have shown an overall 1% incidence of rhabdomyolysis, defined as creatine kinase > 10 times the upper limit of normal plus muscle symptoms. One randomized, controlled prospective trial has investigated the effects of lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy on patient outcome in cardiac transplant recipients. At 1-year follow-up in this nonblinded, single-center trial, patients treated with pravastatin (20 or 40 mg/day) initiated within 2 weeks of transplantation had a significant reduction in mortality rate and a significantly lower incidence of transplant arteriopathy. A number of important issues remain unanswered regarding treatment guidelines in patients with hyperlipidemia after heart transplantation. In January 1995 we began the Heart Transplant Lipid Registry, with 12 participant centers, to gather data prospectively on the efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering drugs in the treatment of dyslipidemia after heart transplantation.", 
    "6": "The authors evaluated the association between plasma vitamin E content and progression of eye lens opacities. A total of 410 hypercholesterolemic eastern Finnish men participated in the study from January 1990 to September 1993 in Kuopio, Finland. Lens opacities were classified three times at 18-month intervals using the Lens Opacities Classification System II. A low plasma vitamin E level (lowest quartile) was associated with a 3.7-fold excess risk (95% confidence interval 1.2-11.8) of the progression of early cortical lens opacities compared with the highest quartile (p = 0.028). In addition, the number of cigarettes smoked daily was a significant predictor of the progression of cortical lens opacity (relative risk = 1.06 per cigarette, 95% confidence interval 1.003-1.12). The progression of nuclear lens opacities was not associated with either the plasma vitamin E content or smoking. The data suggest that low plasma vitamin E content may be associated with increased risk of the progression of early cortical lens opacity.", 
    "7": "ATP-citrate lyase is the primary enzyme responsible for the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA in many tissues. Inhibitors of the enzyme represent a potentially novel class of hypolipidemic agent, which are anticipated to have combined hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic properties. A series of 2-substituted butanedioic acids have been designed and synthesized as inhibitors of the enzyme. The best compounds, 58, 68, 71, 74 have reversible Ki's in the 1-3 microM range against the isolated rat enzyme. As representative of this compound class, 58, has been shown to exert its inhibitory action through a mainly competitive mechanism with respect to citrate and a noncompetitive one with respect to CoA. None of the inhibitors were able to inhibit cholesterol and/or fatty acid synthesis in HepG2 cells. This has been attributed to the adverse physicochemical properties of the molecules leading to a lack of cell penetration. Despite this, a lead structural class of compound has been identified with the potential for modification into potent, cell-penetrant, and efficacious inhibitors of ATP-citrate lyase.", 
    "8": "The efficacy and safety of the HMG-CoA reductase fluvastatin was investigated in a multicenter, open label clinical therapeutic trial in the treatment of hypercholesterinaemia in hypertensive patients (WHO I-II.). 49 patients were involved, 6 patients were dropped out because of th lack of compliance, 43 patients were investigated (mean age: 57.6 +/- 9.4 years, mean blood pressure: 146 +/- 16/88+/- g mmHg (systolic/diastolic). The antihypertensive treatment was unchanged during the study. An 8 weeks low-lipid diet was started if the fasting total cholesterol (TC) level was equal or higher than 6.5 mM/L and the triglyceride level was lower than 4.6 mM/L. After the dietary period fluvastatin treatment was started (20 mg o.d.), if the level of LDL-C was higher than 4,1 mM/L. Blood pressure, heart rate, TC, HDL-C (HDL2-C, HDL3-C), apoA1, apoB, TG were measured at the 4th, 8th, 12th weeks of treatment. LDL-C was calculated with Fridewald equation. The daily dose of fluvastatin was increased to 40 mg, if LDL-C level was higher than 3.5 mM/L after 4 weeks of treatment. 36 patients completed the study (Group B). 7 patients were dropped out at the end of the dietary period, because of the significant decrease of TC and LDL-C levels (Group A). In Group B fluvastatin significantly reduced the level of TC (from 7.22 +/- 0.88 to 5.99 +/- 0.98 mM/L), of LDL-C (from 5.13 +/- 0.71 to 3.95 +/- 0.88 mM/L), and the level of ApoB (from 0.97 +/- 0.26 to 0.85 +/- 0.15 mM/L), but did not influence significantly the level of HDL-C, ApoA1 and TG. The diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly during the dietary period, while after beginning the fluvastatin treatment the decrease of the systolic blood pressure became significant. There was no change in the heart rate. Only minor side effects were observed in 3 patients (dysuria, constipation, lack of appetite). Fluvastatin proved to be an effective and well-tolerated drug in the treatment of hypercholesterinaemia in hypertensive patients.", 
    "9": "Heterozygotes for familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) have two populations of low density lipoprotein (LDL), one bearing normal apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B) and the other bearing defective apo B which exhibits a much lower affinity for the LDL-receptor. If HMGCoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin lowered LDL mainly by up-regulating LDL-receptor mediated clearance, they should decrease the overall binding affinity of LDL from an FDB heterozygote by selectively decreasing LDL bearing normal apo B. We compared how LDL from FDB heterozygotes competed with normal 125I-labelled LDL for binding to LDL-receptors while on and off therapy with simvastatin. The LDL of FDB heterozygotes had 40% (n = 10) the affinity of normal LDL (n = 12) for the LDL receptor on cultured fibroblasts, and 55% (n = 6) of normal LDL (n = 6) for that on HepG2 cells. Treatment of FDB subjects with simvastatin (n = 10) decreased serum LDL by 22% but had no effect on its binding affinity for LDL receptors, indicative of lowering of LDL containing both normal and defective apo B. This is consistent with the major LDL lowering effect being associated with decreased synthesis of LDL, rather than enhanced LDL-receptor clearance.", 
    "10": "In microsomal preparations of CaCo-2 cells pravastatin decreased cholesterol esterifying activity at 25 micrograms/ml to 82.5% and at 800 micrograms/ml to 56.2% of controls. Pravastatin reduced cholesteryl ester formation dose-dependently also in viable CaCo-2 cells. However, the maximal inhibition was by 90.4% at pravastatin concentration of 25 micrograms/ml, half maximal inhibition occurred between concentrations of 5 and 10 micrograms/ml. Addition of mevalonolactone, which serves as endogenous source of cholesterol, antagonized this effect. At 10 mM mevalonolactone (MVL) even doses up to 200 micrograms/ml of pravastatin were ineffective. On the other hand, pravastatin suppressed cholesteryl ester formation when acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) (E.C. 2.3.1.26) activity was stimulated by addition of exogenous liposomal or Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol. This inhibition was refractory to increasing amounts of exogenous cholesterol up to 400 micrograms/ml. Therefore we conclude that only excessive doses of pravastatin suppress ACAT activity directly. In viable cells the observed inhibition of cholesteryl ester formation is due to the block in de novo synthesis of cholesterol, causing a lack of substrate for ACAT and of non-sterol products of mevalonic acid. Furthermore pravastatin interferes with the esterification and/or intracellular transport only of exogenous cholesterol, confirming former results of a compartmentalized cholesterol metabolism in the enterocyte.",

After 6 weeks on 20 mg pravastatin, total cholesterol decreased by 18% (0.9 mmol/L, p < 0.0001), triglycerides decreased by 6% (0.1 mmol/L ns), LDL-cholesterol decreased by 23% (1.1 mmol/L, p < 0.0001), and HDL-cholesterol increased by 8% (0.1 mmol/L, ns). A similar effect was also observed after 26 weeks of therapy. These effects were also significant when compared with the placebo group. In 61% of patients treated with pravastatin there was a reduction in cholesterol to less than 5.2 mmol/L, and no real change in lipid levels in patients receiving placebo. No significant differences were observed between the active and placebo groups with regard to patient withdrawal, compliance, or adverse reactions.",

Among the tested isoprenoids, only farnesol and geranylgeraniol induce actin cytoskeleton disorganization, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. In contrast, desmosterol leads only to growth inhibition. We show that all tested isoprenoids are potent inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase activity, the sterols being the most powerful while they induce neither F-actin disorganization nor apoptosis. Thus the molecular mechanisms induced by farnesol and geranylgeraniol appear independent of reductase regulation. Our results point out the specific role of farnesol and geranylgeraniol on actin cytoskeleton organization and apoptosis in adenocarcinoma cells.",

Mevinolin (lovastatin) was found to increase the LDL receptor expression by 70% at the same concentration. In contrast to mevinolin, 1 was found to have no effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in liver homogenates or in HepG2 cells at doses where substantial upregulation of the LDL receptor was observed and thus stimulated LDL receptor expression by a novel mechanism.",

Lovastatin at a mean dose of 36 mg/d lowered total and LDL cholesterol by 21 +/- 11% and 29 +/- 11%, respectively, but these levels changed by < 2% in placebo-treated patients. Coronary arteriography was repeated after 2 years in 72 smokers and their 557 lesions were measured blindly with an automated quantitative system, along with 1752 lesions in 227 nonsmokers.

Lovastatin-treated smokers had less worsening (0.07 +/- 0.15 mm) than placebo-treated smokers (P = .024). One or more coronary lesions progressed in 16 of 34 lovastatin-treated smokers and in 28 of 38 placebo-treated smokers (47% versus 74%, P < .001). In the placebo group, new coronary lesions developed in 21 of 38 smokers and in 28 of 115 nonsmokers (55% versus 24%, P < .001); fewer lovastatin-treated smokers developed new lesions (15% versus 55%, P < .001).",

The efficacy and safety of lovastatin in 459 African-Americans with hypercholesterolemia were studied in the Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin study, a multicenter, double-blind, diet- and placebo-controlled trial. This trial involved 8,245 patients who were randomly assigned, regardless of race, to receive placebo or lovastatin at doses of 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, 20 mg twice daily, or 40 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. Among African-Americans, lovastatin produced sustained, dose-related (p <0.001) decreases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (20% to 38%), total cholesterol (14% to 28%), and triglycerides (8% to 15%). From 75% to 96% of African-Americans treated with lovastatin achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program goal of low-density lipoprotien cholesterol <160 mg/di, and from 33% to 71% achieved the goal <130 mg/di. The safety profile of lovastotin in African-Americans was generally favorable. A relatively high incidence of creatine kinase levels greater than the upper limit of normal was observed in African-Americans during the study, i.e., 63% in the placebo group and similar levels in lovastatin treatment groups. Lovastatin is highly effective and generally well tolerated as therapy for primary hypercholesterolemia in African-Americans.",

    "22": "In this study, we report a novel anticarcinogenic activity of an organosulfur compound from garlic, diallyl disulfide (DADS). DADS treatment significantly inhibited the growth of H-ras oncogene transformed tumors in nude mice. As compared to controls, the appearance of tumors was also delayed markedly by oral administration of DADS. The inhibition of tumor growth by DADS treatment correlated with the inhibition of p21H-ras membrane association in the tumor tissue. The levels of membrane associated p21H-ras were markedly lower in the tumor tissues of DADS treated mice as compared to controls. An opposite trend, however, was evident for cytosolic p21H-ras. Furthermore, DADS treatment resulted in a significant inhibition of hepatic as well as tumoral 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. These results indicate that DADS suppresses the growth of H-ras oncogene transformed tumors in nude mice by inhibiting the membrane association of tumoral p21H-ras.", 
    "23": "Allatostatins with a typical YXFGL-amide C-terminus constitute a neuropeptide family, which was discovered because of its inhibitory action on insect juvenile hormone synthesis. In the search for possible new functions for allatostatins we focused our attention on the fat body. Our previous studies on the cockroach Blattella germanica suggested the occurrence of factors terminating vitellogenesis, and the hypothesis here was that allatostatins might be one of these factors. Our experiments have shown that allatostatin impaired vitellogenin release in fat bodies incubated in vitro, and that this effect appears to be mediated by the inhibition of vitellogenin glycosylation. Fluvastatin also inhibited vitellogenin release, and mevalonolactone counteracted the inhibitory effects of allatostatin. These results suggest that allatostatin acts upon the mevalonate pathway and synthesis of dolichol, which would explain the inhibition of vitellogenin glycosylation. We finally conclude that allatostatins may effectively contribute to the termination of the vitellogenic cycle in B. germanica.", 
    "24": "The thrombospondin and collagen receptor CD36 was recently found to function, also, as a dominating scavenger receptor for oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDL). Thus, CD36 might be a key factor in monocyte adhesion and foam cell formation. We, therefore, studied CD36 expression in monocytic cells under conditions of cholesterol depletion and overload. Human monocytic U937 cells were cultured under control conditions and in the presence of lovastatin, native, and oxLDL. The expression of lipoprotein receptors was measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In sharp contrast to the feedback-controlled ApoB100 specific receptor for native low-density lipoprotein (LDL-R), CD36 expression was significantly reduced by lovastatin in a dose-dependent manner, both at the RNA and protein level, resulting in decreased cellular oxLDL binding. The addition of mevalonate completely reversed lovastatin effects, whereas excess LDL was only partially effective. Similarly to native LDL, oxLDL reduced LDL-R transcription, but did not affect CD36 transcription. CD36 protein surface expression fell, however, due to internalization of CD36 loaded with oxLDL. In summary, monocytic expression of CD36, in contrast to the native LDL-R, is reduced by cholesterol synthesis inhibition and not by feedback inhibition from substrate overexposure. CD36 suppression is a new pharmacological action of lovastatin that may contribute to its clinical benefit by attenuating monocyte adhesion and foam cell formation, key steps in atherosclerosis.", 
    "25": "The biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acid (FA) proceeds by independent pathways. Information is lacking on potential interaction that could provide feedback regulation between these pathways. In an attempt to search for a new approach to produce a dual effect on regulation of these two processes, we have identified mevalonate-5-diphosphate (MevPP) decarboxylase, an enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, the inhibition of which leads not only to the suppression of cholesterol but also FA biosynthesis. Mechanistic studies with Hep G2 cells using specific inhibitors for MevPP decarboxylase and related enzymes reveal that the inhibitory effect on FA biosynthesis is mainly due to the accumulation of MevPP, resulting from MevPP decarboxylase inhibition. The present study proposes a new mechanism through which interpathway regulation could take place between the cholesterol and FA cascades.",

Since the introduction of lovastatin for clinical use in the United States in 1987, statins have become widely available and the number of patients treated with these compounds is estimated to be over 2 million. The incidence of adverse effects is very low with elevated transaminase levels and myopathy being of greatest concern. Currently, several intervention trials demonstrated the influence of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors on total and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and on regression of atherosclerosis as well. Fluvastatin, LESCOLR, a synthetic drug, is the most recently approved HMG CoA reductase inhibitor. PATIENTS METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: At the lipid clinic 18 patients (8 familial hypercholesterolemia heterozygotes and 10 subjects affected with familial combined hyperlipidemia) have been treated with increasing dose of fluvastatin (20 and 40 mg/day with the evening meal) for 3 months. All patients respected AHA step I diet. The basic parameters of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism have been measured, and apo A-I, apo B levels as well.",

The hypolipidemic effect was even more pronounced in LDL-cholesterol level, which was reduced by 21% and 29%. Decrease of LDL-cholesterol has been accompanied by reduction of apo B concentration by 16% resp. 24%. Also triglycerides levels were significantly influenced (-9%). On the other hand treatment with fluvastatin did not affect HDL-cholesterol and apo A-I concentration.",

    "34": "The goals of secondary prevention after myocardial infarction are to avoid the complications of infarction itself, to prevent reinfarction, to detect and treat ischaemic episodes and to slow the progression of atherosclerosis. Antiplatelet therapy, especially with aspirin, has a clearcut beneficial effect decreasing cardiovascular mortality and of non-fatal reinfarction. A metaanalysis of ten trials has shown a 25% decrease in vascular events in the long-term, irrespective of age, gender, blood pressure blood glucose level, and dosage whether low (75 to 160 mg) or moderate (160 to 325 mg/day). Apart from the irreversible inhibition of cyclooxygenase, a beneficial effect on remodelling may be observed. Lipid lowering therapy has made significant advances since the introduction of the statimes. Compared with fibrates, statines have the advantage of reducing total mortality in addition to coronary mortality, whereas the fibrates, though reducing the latter, have been reported to increase total mortality and non-coronary mortality, but in a non-significant manner. Fibrates remain the drugs of choice for the treatment of pure hypertriglyceridaemia. The mechanisms of action of the statine are diverse: effects on endothelium-dependent relaxation, haemostasis, stabilisation of the atheromatous plaque and prevention of its rupture. The cost/effectiveness ratio of aspirin and statines is very high, the latter being much more cost-effective than, for example, the treatment of mild hypertension.", 
    "35": "Fertility and reproduction studies were conducted in rats with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin. Male rats received vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) or atorvastatin at 20, 100, or 175 mg/kg by oral gavage for 11 weeks prior to mating with untreated females; treatment continued throughout mating and until necropsy on Day 115. An untreated control group of males was also included in the same procedures. Dose-related body weight gain suppressions of 17 and 25%, and food consumption suppressions of 7 and 16%, occurred during the 11-week premating treatment period at 100 and 175 mg/kg, respectively, compared with vehicle controls. There were no treatment-related effects on testes, epididymides, or accessory organs weights, testicular or epididymal sperm counts, sperm motility, or sperm morphology during Week 15 of treatment. Plasma drug concentrations during Week 15 increased with dose to a Cmax of 1820 +/- 1020 ng eq/ml at 175 mg/kg. There were no effects on copulation or fertility indices, number of days to mating, or female reproductive parameters (number of implants, live fetuses, or pre- and postimplantation loss). In the female fertility study, female rats received vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) or atorvastatin at 20, 100, or 225 mg/kg by oral gavage for 2 weeks prior to mating with untreated males; treatment continued throughout mating and until Gestation Day 7. Sperm-positive females were sacrificed on presumed Gestation Day 13 to 15 for evaluation of reproductive parameters. Body weight gain in atorvastatin groups was comparable to controls during the premating period, but was suppressed by 35% at 225 mg/kg during the treatment period of gestation (Days 0-8), and was significantly increased at 225 mg/ kg during the posttreatment period of gestation (Days 8-13). Plasma drug concentrations on premating treatment Day 14 increased with dose to a Cmax of 7030 +/- 3680 ng eq/ml at 225 mg/ kg. The mean number of estrous cycles, copulation and fertility indices, number of days to mating, and number of viable litters were comparable between groups. In addition, term sacrifice parameters (number of corpora lutea, implants, live fetuses, pre- and postimplantation loss) were not significantly different between groups. Thus, these studies demonstrate no adverse effects of atorvastatin on fertility and reproduction in rats at doses up to 175 and 225 mg/kg in males and females, respectively, and 20 mg/kg was a no-effect dose.", 
    "36": "Coronary arteries are regulated by neuronal mechanisms, hormones and paracrine mediators. The importance of endothelium-dependent mechanisms has recently been recognized. The endothelium responds to mechanical and chemical signals from the blood by releasing mediators that modulate vascular tone and structure, platelet function, coagulation and monocyte adhesion. Important relaxing factors are nitric oxide, prostacyclin and a putative hyperpolarizing factor. Nitric oxide also inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and, together with prostacyclin, platelet function. Bradykinin-induced nitric oxide production is reduced by angiotensin-converting enzyme. Endothelin-1, thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2 are contracting factors. Thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2 activate platelets, while endothelin has no direct platelet effects, but causes smooth muscle proliferation. In hypercholestermia, endothelium-dependent relaxation is impaired and contraction as well as adhesion of monocytes and platelets enhanced. Pharmacological correction of hyperlipidemia by statins also improves or normalizes endothelial dysfunction in patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have similar effects.", 
    "37": "It has been shown previously that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HMG-CoA RIs) such as compactin and lovastatin suppress human lymphocyte functions in vitro (Cuthbert and Lipsky, 1981; Cutts and Bankhurst, 1989). Although it is not fully understood what inhibitory role the HMG-CoA RIs perform in causing this suppression, we show in this study that a certain inhibition threshold (inhibition level > 90%) of lymphocytic HMG-CoA reductase is required for the HMG-CoA RIs to attain effective inhibitory action in human lymphocyte lymphocyte functions in vitro. Thus the inhibitory activity of simvastatin, a lipophilic inhibitor, on sterol synthesis (HMG-CoA reductase activity) in lymphocytes was as much as 430 times more potent than that of pravastatin sodium, a hydrophilic inhibitor (IC50; 0.013 microM and 5.6 microM, respectively), and although pravastatin sodium and simvastatin at concentration levels of 10 and 0.016 microM respectively, inhibited the sterol synthesis in just over 50%, they failed to inhibit the lymphocyte functions. Significant inhibition (P < 0.01) of lymphocyte functions, including lymphocyte proliferative response to a variety of stimuli and activated natural killer-cell cytotoxicity, was demonstrated only when greater than 90% of the sterol synthesis in lymphocytes was inhibited by either simvastatin or simvastatin sodium salt at concentrations above 2 microM. This simvastatin-induced inhibition of lymphocyte functions was almost completely reversed by the addition of a 1 mM solution of mevalonate. Although simvastatin at a lower clinical blood concentration of 0.016 microM failed to inhibit either lymphocyte functions or HMG-CoA reductase activity sufficiently, at this level it caused a significant increase in cyclosporin A-induced suppression of T-cell response. These results infer that insufficient inhibition (in the 50% region) of HMG-CoA reductase activity by a low clinical blood concentration of HMG-CoA RIs, could still render the lymphocytes susceptible to immunosuppressive treatments. Pravastatin sodium on the other hand, is inactive in inhibiting lymphocyte functions in vitro, and such inactivity can be explained solely of the basis of its failure to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity in lymphocytes sufficiently.", 
    "38": "Tolerance and pharmacokinetics after single-dose administration of atorvastatin, an investigational inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, were examined in 22 healthy volunteers in a three-period, partially-blinded study. Participants received capsule and solution doses of atorvastatin (0.5 to 120 mg) and placebo at weekly intervals. Atorvastatin was well tolerated at doses as high as 80 mg. The adverse event profile was similar after administration of atorvastatin capsules and placebo. Atorvastatin solution was slightly less well tolerated. The most common side effect after administration of capsules and solution was headache, followed by sporadic reports of diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea. At the 120-mg solution dose, one participant experienced mild, transient restlessness, euphoria, and mental confusion that were considered to be dose-limiting side effects. Mean concentrations of atorvastatin, maximum concentration (Cmax), and area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last detectable concentration (AUCo-tldc) increased with increasing dose. Plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) ranged from 14.7 to 57.6 hours. The bioavailability of atorvastatin capsules was similar to that of solution. These results suggest that atorvastatin is well tolerated after single doses as high as 80 mg, and may require administration only once daily.", 
    "39": "Recently, a new class of lipid lowering agents [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors] was introduced into clinical practice. The use of these agents could lead to a secondary deficiency in carnitine, which may manifest clinically as a myalgia/myositis-a side effect that is occasionally seen with this class of drugs. In the present study, we examined the effect of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (lovastatin) on serum and tissue levels of carnitine and carnitine acyltransferase activities in the rabbit. Rabbits (n = 6) were fed chow containing lovastatin (30 mg/d) for 16 wk. Blood was collected and tissues (liver, heart, and skeletal muscle) harvested at sacrifice. Free and total carnitine were measured in serum and tissues by a radioenzymatic method. Carnitine acetyltransferase and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) activities were determined and expressed relative to DNA. Serum free (24.0 +/- 2.6 vs. 29.4 +/- 3.1 microM) and total (35.1 +/- 4.7 vs. 52.8 +/- 8.8 microM) carnitine levels increased significantly with 16 wk of treatment. This increase in total carnitine was mainly due to an increase in the levels of serum acylcarnitine (12.7 +/- 3.1 vs 26.5 +/- 5.7 microM). Tissue levels of total carnitine were significantly decreased by the treatment. Carnitine acetyltransferase was unaffected by the treatment, whereas there was a significant increase in the activity of CPT in the liver and heart.", 
    "40": "Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), a measure of tight junction (TJ) barrier function, develops more rapidly and reaches higher values after preincubation of MDCK cells for 24 h with 2 microM Lovastatin (lova), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. While this effect was attributed to a 30% fall in cholesterol (CH), possible effects of lova on the supply of prenyl group precursors could not be excluded. In the current study, strategies were devised to examine effects on TER of agents that simultaneously lower CH and increase the flux of intermediates through the CH biosynthetic pathway. Zaragozic acid, 20 microM, an inhibitor of squalene synthase known to increase the synthesis of isoprenoids and levels of prenylated proteins, lowered cell CH by 30% after 24 h, while accelerating development of TER in the same manner as lova. TER was also enhanced, despite a 23% increase in the rate of [3H]acetate incorporation into CH, when total CH was reduced by 45% during a 2-h incubation with 2 mM methyl beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD), an agent that stimulates CH efflux from cells. The fact that the rate of TER development was diminished when cell CH content was elevated by incubation with a complex of CH and MBCD is further evidence that this sterol modulates development of the epithelial barrier. Cell associated CH derived from the complex was similar to endogenous CH with respect to its accessibility to cholesterol oxidase. Lova's effect on TER was diminished when 5 micrograms/mL of CH was added to the medium during the last 11 h of incubation with lova.", 
    "41": "Effectiveness of a simultaneous inhibition of cholesterol absorption and synthesis, caused by sitostanol ester margarine and pravastatin, was studied to control mild hypercholesterolemia in men with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (n = 8). Margarine, 24 g daily, was a basal dietary treatment. Four 7-week intervention periods included margarine, sitostanol (3 g/day) ester margarine, pravastatin (40 mg/day), and sitostanol ester margarine plus pravastatin in a random order. Pravastatin lowered serum total (-32%) and LDL cholesterol (-38%) and apolipoprotein B (-39%) because of enhanced removal (+20%) and decreased production (-26%) of LDL apolipoprotein B, and reduced synthesis (-9%) and turnover (-8%) of cholesterol, which resulted in reduced biliary cholesterol seretion (-18%). Even though serum triglycerides were lowered by 28%, VLDL, IDL, and light and dense LDL became triglyceride-enriched. Despite increasing cholesterol synthesis, sitostanol lowered LDL cholesterol (-14%) by inhibiting cholesterol absorption (-68%) and LDL apolipoprotein B production rate (-20%). Combination of pravastatin and sitostanol ester lowered serum total, VLDL, IDL, and LDL cholesterol and LDL apolipoprotein B by the highest rate, 35%, 50%, 35%, 44%, and 45% from the control margarine period, respectively, because of reduced apolipoprotein B transport rate (but unchanged removal), in both the total and dense LDL subfractions. HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I kinetics were unchanged. In spite of decreased absorption, cholesterol synthesis was not compensatorily increased. In conclusion, simultaneous inhibition of cholesterol absorption and synthesis lowers LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B by 44-45% solely through inhibition of LDL apolipoprotein B production rate in hypercholesterolemic NIDDM patients. A combination of statin to sitostanol ester margarine-resistant patients offers a safe and effective measure to normalize abnormally high cholesterol values, probably with a lowered statin dose.", 
    "42": "1. We tested whether lipid lowering treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitor modified the flow mediated large artery reactivity in primary pure hypercholesterolaemia. 2. Abnormalities in arterial reactivity have been described in the presence of high blood cholesterol, in particular an enhanced constriction of the brachial artery in response to acute induction of a low flow state. 3. Using pulsed-Doppler, we measured brachial artery diameter and flow velocity at rest and their changes induced by wrist occlusion before and after 3 months of double-blind treatment by pravastatin (40 mg orally) in 13 subjects and placebo in 15 others. 4. The significant decrease (P < 0.01) in diameter induced by wrist occlusion before (0.34 +/- 0.08 mm) placebo and pravastatin (0.39 +/- 0.10 mm) persisted after placebo (0.26 +/- 0.07 mm) but was abolished after pravastatin (0.07 +/- 0.05 mm). The absolute change in diameter induced by wrist occlusion was lower after than before pravastatin (P < 0.01) and lower after pravastin than after placebo (P < 0.05). Diameter during the wrist occlusion was higher after pravastatin than after placebo (4.35 +/- 0.16 vs 3.89 +/- 0.09 mm); P < 0.01). 5. These findings indicate that the lipid changes induced by pravastatin and/or some unknown but direct mechanism of the drug itself inhibit low-flow-mediated vasoconstriction associated with hypercholesterolaemia. Such effects may have important implications for the treatment of vasospasm often seen in the presence of high blood cholesterol.", 
    "43": "1. The objective of this study was to compare in cultured human hepatocytes or Hep G2 cells, changes in the fate of unesterified low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol induced by crilvastatin, a new cholesterol lowering drug and a reference statin, simvastatin. 2. The experiments were carried out for 20 h, each well contained 4.2 x 10(5)/cm2 Hep G2 cells or 0.5 x 10(5)/Cm2 human hepatocytes, 130 microM ursodeoxycholate, 0.68 microCi or 1.59 microCi unesterified human [14C]-LDL-cholesterol, crilvastatin or simvastatin at 0 or 50 microM (both cell types) or 300 microM (Hep-G2 cells). Incubation with the two drugs resulted in increased amounts of unesterified [14C]-LDL-cholesterol taken by the two cell types, compared to control. 3. Crilvastatin 50 microM led to significantly higher quantities of [14C]-glyco-tauro-conjugated bile salts, compared to simvastatin. Statins reduced the apo B100 level secreted by the two cell types (simvastatin) or human hepatocytes (crilvastatin). Crilvastatin enhanced both the level of apo A1 secreted by the Hep G2 cells and the level of APF, a high density lipoprotein (HDL) and biliary apoprotein. 4. Crilvastatin not only acts by stimulating LDL-cholesterol uptake by hepatocytes, but also by enhancing the catabolism of LDL-cholesterol in bile salts and probably by stimulating HDL and/or bile component secretion. Such a mechanism was not previously described for HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Our results on APF show that this apoprotein could be considered also as an indicator of changes in bile and/or HDL compartments. 5. The human hepatocyte model appeared to be a suitable and relevant model in the pharmacological-metabolic experiments carried out in this study. It led to more consistent data than those obtained with Hep G2 cells.",

    "45": "We evaluated in a parallel, double-blind randomized fashion the effect of gemfibrozil (1200 mg/day) (n = 40) or simvastatin (20 mg/day) (n = 41) on lipids, apolipoprotein-B (apo-B)-containing lipoproteins, apo-CIII and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], in 81 well-defined FCH patients.", 
    "46": "While both drugs lowered plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, gemfibrozil lowered plasma triglycerides more effectively by reduction of triglycerides in VLDL and LDL, whereas simvastatin was more effective in its reduction of total plasma cholesterol by exclusively decreasing LDL cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) increased to an equal extent on both therapies. Total serum apo-B levels were reduced with both drugs; however, gemfibrozil decreased apo-B only in VLDL + IDL, whereas simvastatin decreased apo-B in both VLDL + IDL and LDL. In keeping with a more effective reduction of VLDL particles, a more pronounced reduction of apo-CIII also was observed after gemfibrozil, which correlated with the reduction in plasma triglycerides. Baseline concentrations of Lp(a) showed a wide range in both treatment groups. Median Lp(a) levels increased after simvastatin, but were not affected by gemfibrozil.", 
    "47": "Both therapies exhibited their specific effects, although none of the drugs alone completely normalized the lipid profiles of these patients with FCH.

    "48": "A potential chemopreventive action of pravastatin (Pr), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on colon carcinogenesis was evaluated in F344 rats. All rats at 7 weeks of age received an intrarectal dose of 2 mg of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea 3 times weekly for 2 weeks in experiment I (2 groups of 16 rats each), and for 3 weeks in experiment II (4 groups of 30 rats each). They were given drinking water containing 0 ppm (control) or 200 ppm Pr during weeks 1 to 40 in experiment I, and containing 0 ppm (control), 25 ppm, 5 ppm and 1 ppm Pr during weeks 4 to 40 in experiment II. The body weight gains, and food and water intakes were similar in all the groups. The incidence of colon carcinomas at termination of the experiment at week 40 was not different in the 200 ppm Pr and control groups in experiment I (63% vs. 69%), while it was significantly lower in the 25 ppm and 5 ppm groups, but not in the 1 ppm Pr group, compared with the control group in experiment II (50%, 48%, and 77% vs. 80%). This inhibitory effect of Pr against colon carcinogenesis was not related to the cholesterol-lowering effect of this agent. We postulate that Pr inhibits the promotion stage of colon carcinogenesis, perhaps through modulation of cholesterol synthesis in situ in the colonic mucosa, thereby suppressing farnesyl isoprenylation of growth-regulating proteins such as p21 ras.", 
    "49": "We have used the Tpr-Met oncogene as a model to examine signaling pathways of growth factors and tyrosine kinase oncogenes that can increase parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP) production. PTHRP production in Tpr-Met transfected cells, when assessed by Northern blot analysis and radioimmunoassay, was increased four- to eightfold. Treatment of these cells with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D and nuclear run-off assays showed that the major cause of increased PTHRP mRNA was enhanced gene transcription. To analyze the intracellular signaling molecules involved in PTHRP production, stable cell lines expressing a Tyr489 Phe mutant of the Tpr-Met oncoprotein were examined. The mutant fails to activate phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase or associate with the Grb-2 adaptor protein and caused a significant reduction in PTHRP production. Treatment of wild-type Tpr-Met transfected cells with wortmannin, a PI-3 kinase inhibitor, had no effect on PTHRP production; however, treatment of these cells with lovastatin, an inhibitor of p21ran isoprenylation, significantly reduced PTHRP expression. These results show that PTHRP is a downsteam target of the Tpr-Met oncogene and indicate that the PTHRP stimulating activity is mediated via the Ras signaling pathway.", 
    "50": "The thoracic aorta is frequently involved in atherosclerotic lesions associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) allows quantitative evaluation of the wall properties of the thoracic aorta. Using TEE, we tested whether atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta in FH could be improved by cholesterol-lowering therapies. The subjects investigated were 22 FH patients and 22 age-matched normal subjects. The descending aorta (DA) was divided into four longitudinal portions of equal length. Atheromatous lesions of each portion of the DA were scored by character and extension of lesions by biplane two-dimensional TEE. The scores of atheromatous lesions from all four portions of the DA were added together to give the total atheromatous score (TAS). We also measured instantaneous dimensional changes of the DA in a cardiac cycle by M-mode TEE and blood pressure by a cuff method and calculated the stiffness parameter beta (In[SBP/DBP]/[Dmax-Dmin]/Dmin), where SBP is the systolic arterial blood pressure, DBP is the diastolic arterial blood pressure, Dmax is the maximum aortic dimension during the ejection period, and Dmin is the minimum aortic dimension during the preejection period. TAS was higher in FH (3.70 +/- 1.32) than normal (0.62 +/- 0.54, P < .0001) subjects. Beta in FH (10.35 +/- 4.87) was greater than in normal (5.10 +/- 1.25, P < .0001) subjects, but there were no significant differences of DA dimensions between the groups. In both normal subjects and FH patients, beta correlated with age (r = .52, P < .02 and r = .59, P < .005, respectively). In FH patients, beta and TAS correlated well with pretreatment total cholesterol levels (r = .43, P < .05 and r = .60, P < .005, respectively). In 12 of 22 FH patients, strict cholesterol-lowering therapies with diet and cholesterol-lowering drugs (pravastatin and probucol) were undertaken for 13 months. Cholesterol levels were significantly decreased from 333 +/- 45 to 219 +/- 39 mg/dL (P < .0001); this was associated with significant decreases in beta and TAS (from 9.88 +/- 5.03 to 7.88 +/- 3.92, P < .005, and from 3.61 +/- 1.50 to 2.94 +/- 1.22, P < .0005, respectively). In FH patients, the incidence and severity of morphological and physiological atherosclerosis of the DA were significantly higher than in age-matched normal subjects. A significant regression of atherosclerosis was achieved by strict cholesterol-lowering therapies in relatively young FH patients.", 
    "51": "The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is a common inherited birth disorder caused by markedly reduced 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase activity, the final enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. BM 15.766 (4-[2-[1-(4-chlorocinnamyl)piperazin-4-yl]ethyl]-benzoic acid) inhibits 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase activity, reduces plasma cholesterol levels, and increases 7-dehydrocholesterol levels to reproduce the biochemical abnormalities of the syndrome in rats. Cholesterol, cholic acid, and lovastatin, alone or in combinations, were fed to rats given BM 15.766, and hepatic activities of the last two enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, lathosterol 5-dehydrogenase and 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase, were measured. After feeding BM 15.766, hepatic 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase activity decreased by 77% while lathosterol 5-dehydrogenase activity tended to increase, so that the ratio of 5-dehydrogenase to delta 7-reductase activities increased from 0.33 to 2.8. In BM 15.766-fed rats, treatment with cholesterol suppressed both 5-dehydrogenase and delta 7-reductase activities by 76% and 66%, respectively, and decreased the 5-dehydrogenase: delta 7-reductase activities ratio from 2.8 to 2.2. In contrast, treatment with cholic acid and BM 15.766 further inhibited delta 7-reductase activity by 67% without changing significantly the 5-dehydrogenase activity that had increased the ratio to 5.5. Combining BM 15.766 with lovastatin increased 5-dehydrogenase activity fivefold but did not change delta 7-reductase activity, raising the ratio to 14.3. In BM 15.766-treated rats, the first and last two enzymatic reactions in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, lathosterol 5-dehydrogenase, and 7-dehydrocholesterol delta 7-reductase are down-regulated by cholesterol. Thus, only cholesterol and not cholic acid or lovastatin could reduce elevated plasma 7-dehydrocholesterol levels induced by BM 15.766.", 
    "52": "We showed previously that cholesterol biosynthesis in dermal fibroblasts from patients with metabolic disorders of peroxisomal origin is increased in steps prior to mevalonate, whereas low-density-lipoprotein(LDL)-receptor activities were not different from control fibroblasts. Here, the suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity by lovastatin was studied both in dermal fibroblasts from patients with different peroxisomal defects and in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line lacking morphologically intact peroxisomes. In addition, the formation of intracellular cholesteryl esters (a measure of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase(ACAT)-activity) stimulated by exogenous LDL was investigated. A dose-dependent suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis by lovastatin at concentrations of 1-50 mumol/l was observed which was comparable in normal and peroxisomal-disease fibroblasts. ACAT activity was measured in the absence and presence of exogenous LDL using [3H]oleate as a substrate for cholesterol ester synthesis. The basal esterification rate was equal or lower in peroxisomal-defective fibroblasts compared with controls. In the presence of exogenous LDL, cholesterol esterification was significantly impaired in all defective cells in comparison with normal fibroblasts. We conclude that changes in cholesterol homeostasis in peroxisomal diseased fibroblasts be related to cholesterol ester formation.", 
    "53": "Depletion of mevalonic acid (MVA), obtained by inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase using lovastatin, depressed the biosynthesis of dolichyl-phosphate and the rate of N-linked glycosylation and caused growth arrest in the melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2. The growth arrest was partially prevented by addition of high concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) to the cells, indicating that MVA depletion may inhibit cell growth through decreasing the number of IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R) at the cell surface. Such a decrease in receptor number might be a result of a lowered translocation of de novo synthesized receptors to the cell membrane which in turn might be a result of a decreased N-linked glycosylation of the receptor proteins. We could also demonstrate that IGF-1R became underglycosylated and that the amount of de novo synthesized IGF-1R proteins at the cell membrane was drastically decreased upon MVA depletion. Analysis of receptor proteins cross-linked with IGF-1, as well as binding assays and immunocytostaining confirmed that the number of functional membrane-bound IGF-1R was substantially reduced. The N-linked glycosylation and the expression of de novo synthesized IGF-1R proteins at the cell surface as well as the number of IGF-1 binding sites were completely restored upon replenishment of MVA. These effects of MVA were efficiently abrogated by the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. The translocation of IGF-1R to the cell membrane was shown to take place just prior to initiation of DNA synthesis in arrested cells stimulated with MVA. Additionally, there was a clear correlation between IGF-1 binding and initiation of DNA synthesis with regard to the MVA dose requirement. It was confirmed that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity and N-linked glycosylation also depressed the expression of functional IGF-1R in other cell types (i.e. hepatoblastoma cells and colon cancer cells). Our data suggest that this mechanism is involved in MVA-regulated cell growth.",

    "69": "Plasma levels of fibrinogen, factor VIIc and prothrombin fragment F1 + 2, a marker of thrombin generation in vivo, were studied in 68 subjects with serum total cholesterol (TC) levels between 135 and 349 mg/dl but without clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease and other atherosclerotic risk factors. F1 + 2 plasma levels were directly correlated with TC (p < 0.0004), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; p < 0.0018) and factor VIIc (p < 0.024). Thirty-five subjects with TC greater than 249 mg/dl (median value of the whole group) showed higher levels of F1 + 2 (p < 0.0001) and fibrinogen (p < 0.0015) than those with TC lower than 249 mg/dl. In subjects with TC > 249 mg/dl and F1 + 2 > 1.2 nM (median value of the whole group), a cholesterol-lowering drug (simvastatin) was able to reduce F1 + 2 (p < 0.009) as well as TC and LDL-C. This study shows a relationship between serum cholesterol and the rate of thrombin generation supporting the hypothesis that a hypercoagulable state may occur in hypercholesterolemic subjects before the onset of clinical evidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.", 
    "70": "The toxicity of atorvastatin (AT), an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG), was evaluated in beagle dogs. In 4 studies [2-wk rising dose (daily increasing doses for 1 wk; maintenance for 1 wk), 12-wk rising dose (daily dosing with weekly increases in dose), 2-wk toxicity (daily dosing for 2 wk; 3 dose levels), 13-wk toxicity (daily dosing for 13 wk; 3 dose levels)], dogs received up to 400 mg/kg orally. Doses of 180 mg/kg induced moribundity, necessitating euthanasia. Weight losses up to 26% were seen at doses > or = 150 mg/kg. Decreases in cholesterol levels were dose-related. Alanine and/or aspartate aminotransferase were increased at doses > or = 80 mg/kg; alkaline phosphatase was increased at doses > or = 150 mg/kg. Histopathologic findings were seen at > or = 150 mg/kg and included hepatocellular eosinophilia related to increased smooth endoplasmic reticulum and cholangiohepatitis and cholecystitis at 150 mg/kg in the 2-wk toxicity study; hepatocellular degeneration, centrilobular bridging, cholecystitis, hemorrhage in gallbladder and brain, demyelination of optic nerve, and skeletal muscle necrosis at > or = 280 mg/kg in the 12-wk rising dose study; and erosion and hemorrhage in large intestine, hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis, and inflammation and necrosis of gallbladder epithelium at 320 mg/kg in the 2-wk rising dose study. Doses up to 80 mg/kg for 13 wk did not induce histopathologic lesions in examined organs. AT effectively lowered serum cholesterol in normal lipidemic dogs. Toxicity at AT in dogs was similar to that with other inhibitors of HMG except that lenticular changes were not seen, significant hepatic, testicular, or neurological toxicity was associated only with high doses at AT, and skeletal muscle changes similar to those described in rats and rabbits were identified.", 
    "71": "The pharmacodynamic effects and pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, a potent investigational inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, were studied in 16 normolipidemic subjects after administration of 40 mg daily for 15 days in the morning or evening. Lipid and apolipoprotein parameters were determined, and plasma atorvastatin equivalent concentrations were measured according to a validated enzyme inhibition bioassay procedure. Atorvastatin was well tolerated by the participants. Overall, mean reductions of 34% in total cholesterol, 48% in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 37% in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, 25% in triglycerides, 6% in apolipoprotein A-I, and 34% in apolipoprotein B were observed. Changes in lipid and apolipoprotein values were similar after morning and evening administration of atorvastatin. In contrast, studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have consistently shown that evening administration results in larger reductions in total and LDL cholesterol than does morning administration. Rate and extent of equivalent absorption of atorvastatin were lower during evening than morning administration. Mean elimination half-life values were similar, however, suggesting that there is no diurnal variation in disposition of this drug. Pharmacokinetic differences did not correlate with effects on serum lipids.", 
    "72": "An analysis of the cost-effectiveness of simvastatin was conducted, based on the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S). The total cost of hospitalization in the placebo group was 52.8 million Swedish kronor (SEK) (5.15 million pounds), compared with SEK 36.0 million (3.51 million pounds) in the simvastatin group. This amounts to a 32% reduction, or a saving of SEK 16.8 million (1.6 million pounds) or SEK 7560 (738 pounds) per patient. The net cost per patient for the duration of the study (5.4 years) was SEK 13,540 (1324 pounds). Simvastatin treatment saved an estimated 0.377 undiscounted life years (0.240 life years discounted at 5% per annum). The cost of simvastatin therapy per discounted life-year saved was therefore SEK 56,400 (5502 pounds). Sensitivity analysis, examining the effect of different life expectancies, costs of initiation and monitoring of simvastatin therapy, and discount rates, showed the results to be stable. Conclusion. The cost per life-year saved of simvastatin in the treatment of post-myocardial infarction and angina patients, as determined from 4S data, is well within the range normally considered cost-effective.", 
    "73": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is seen with high frequency in the province of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. A large deletion (> 10 kb) of the 5'-end of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) gene is the major mutation of the LDL-R in FH subjects in Qu\u00e9bec (approximately 60% of FH subjects). No mRNA is produced from the allele bearing the mutation, and cellular cholesterol obtained by receptor-mediated endocytosis is under the control of the non-deletion allele. We have previously reported that some patients with the 10-kb deletion (approximately 9%) fail to respond to the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase) inhibitor class of medications. We studied mRNA levels of the LDL-R and HMG CoA reductase genes in response to the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in cultured human skin fibroblasts and we devised an in vitro model to study the response to drug therapy in subjects with FH. We determined mRNA levels by RNase protection assay in skin fibroblasts obtained from controls (n = 3) and FH subjects with the > 10-kb deletion (responders, n = 3; non responders, n = 3; to drug therapy). We measured 125I-LDL binding on skin fibroblasts grown in the presence of lipoprotein-deficient serum with or without 1 microM lovastatin, using 10 micrograms/mL of 125I-LDL protein. Control subjects exhibited coordinate regulation of the LDL-R and HMG CoA reductase genes in response to lovastatin, 0.1-25 microM, for 0-24 h. Correlation coefficients between mRNA levels of both genes were > 0.9 in controls and FH subjects. However, by linear regression analysis, the corresponding slopes for the correlation between both genes were 0.98 (controls), 3.36 and 3.63 (FH responders and non-responders), indicating a pattern of dissociated but still coordinate regulation in FH subjects. The magnitude of increase of mRNA levels of the LDL-R gene was approximately five-fold over LPDS in controls, two-fold in FH responders and two-fold in non-responders. Binding studies using 125I-LDL reveal that a control subject and all responders had a 2-2.5-fold increase in binding to cell surface receptors but two out of three FH non-responders showed no increase in binding in response to 1 microM lovastatin. The LDL-R and HMG CoA reductase genes are expressed in coordinate regulation in fibroblasts from subjects with FH due to the > 10-kb deletion, but with a proportionately greater up-regulation of the HMG CoA reductase gene. Some subjects, with FH caused by the > 10-kb deletion of the LDL-R gene, who fail to respond to HMG CoA reductase inhibitors have abnormal LDL receptor binding activity at the cell surface in response to lovastatin in vitro.", 
    "74": "Lymphatic absorption and transport of cholesterol and triacylglycerols were examined in rats treated with pravastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Pravastatin-treatment for 1, 7 and 28 days did not affect the recovery of cholesterol and triacylglycerols during 24 h after the lipid administration: the recovery was 52-59% and 82-93% for cholesterol and triacylglycerols, respectively. Rats treated with pravastatin for 28 days had a higher lymphatic recovery of the lipids during 3-6 h after the lipid administration than did control rats. Pravastatin treatment did not affect the ratio of phospholipid to cholesterol in the gut mucosa, the fatty acid composition of the lymph and mucosal lipids. We concluded that an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase would exert no adverse effect on absorption of fat-soluble nutrients by gut.", 
    "75": "The oxidative modification of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) has been widely investigated. However, there are no data concerning the oxidation susceptibility of combined very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and low density lipoprotein fraction, although all of them are atherogenic and contain antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol. We investigated the oxidation susceptibility and oxidation resistance of VLDL + LDL (including IDL) fraction by induction with CuCl2 and its relation to plasma alpha-tocopherol concentration and lipid standardised alpha-tocopherol concentration in 406 non-vitamin E-supplemented men from eastern Finland. Even thought we did not give oral vitamin E or any other antioxidant supplementation to our study participants, we observed a significant, consistent relationship between measurements of oxidation resistance and plasma content of vitamin E. In the multivariate regression model, a high plasma content of vitamin E or lipid standardised vitamin E concentration were the most important determinants of lag time to maximal oxidation rate (standardised regression coefficient = 0.244, P < 0.0001 for vitamin E and 0.211, P < 0.0001 for lipid standardised vitamin E). After statistical adjustment for age, use of cigarettes, hypolipidemic medication (yes vs. no), month of the measurements, plasma concentrations of total ascorbic acid (ascorbic acid + dehydroascorbic acid), beta-carotene and phospholipids, serum concentrations of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and dietary intake of linoleic acid, the lag time to maximal oxidation rate was 10% (95% C.I. 6.0-13.5%) longer in men in the highest fifth than in the lowest fifth of plasma vitamin E content (P < 0.0001 for trend). When the fifths of lipid standardised vitamin E were compared, the lag time to maximal oxidation rate was 6% (95% C.I. 1.8-10.1%) longer in men in the highest than in the lowest fifth (P < 0.0001 for trend). Our data suggest that alpha-tocopherol is an important antioxidant preventing the in vitro oxidation of VLDL + LDL fraction even in non-supplemented subjects.",

Lipid therapy safely reduces the future risk of coronary disease and simultaneously improves life expectancy. These benefits have been demonstrated in patients with and without-prior heart disease. Lipid therapy needs to be prioritized for those at highest absolute risk of coronary disease, that is, in those with established coronary disease or in those with other major risk factors such as diabetes, a positive family history of coronary disease, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, hypertension or cigarette smoking. Drug selection is discussed, as is the place of lipid therapy in the elderly. Many patients fail to continue their lipid therapy beyond a few weeks and this problem needs to be considered by the general practitioner.",

They had at least two cardiovascular risk factors in addition to moderate primary hyperlipidaemia (total cholesterol of at least 6.50 mmol L-1 on three occasions measured by Reflotron triglycerides less than 4.0 mmol L-1 and an LDL:HDL cholesterol ratio of more than 4.0). Most (87%) of the subjects were males; 626 subjects (92%) completed the 18-month follow-up.",

The other subjects receiving intensive advice tended to fare better than those on usual advice. Lifestyle was not influenced significantly over the study period. The ritual of daily medication did not affect the outcome.", 
    "84": "As expected, lipid-lowering medication reduced serum cholesterol as well as overall cardiovascular risk in subjects with several risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was no additive effect of intensive advice to these subjects. However, there was a meagre but significant effect of intensive advice in subjects not receiving active lipid-lowering drugs. One explanation for this difference may be that those on active lipid-lowering medication who had substantial drops in cholesterol might have felt less inclined to change their lifestyle compared with those on other treatment regimens who had less successful drops in cholesterol. There was no benefit from the ritual of taking daily medication.", 
    "85": "Lovastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug that can cause myopathy as a rare side effect. Concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., cyclosporine) increases the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity. Lovastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Because itraconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, we wanted to study a possible interaction between these drugs.", 
    "86": "In this double-blind, randomized, two-phase crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of lovastatin. Plasma concentrations of lovastatin, lovastatin acid, itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole, and creatine kinase were measured up to 24 hours.", 
    "87": "On average, itraconazole increased the peak concentration (Cmax) of lovastatin and the area under the lovastatin concentration-time curve (AUC) more than twentyfold (p < 0.001). The mean Cmax of the active metabolite, lovastatin acid, was increased 13-fold (range, tenfold to 23-fold; p < 0.001) and the AUC(0-24) twentyfold (p < 0.001). In one subject plasma creatine kinase was increased tenfold within 24 hours of lovastatin administration during the itraconazole phase but not during the placebo phase. No increase in creatine kinase was observed in the other subjects.", 
    "88": "Itraconazole greatly increases plasma concentrations of lovastatin and lovastatin acid. Inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism probably explains the increased toxicity of lovastatin caused not only by itraconazole but also by cyclosporine, erythromycin, and other inhibitors of CYP3A4. Their concomitant use with lovastatin and simvastatin should be avoided, or the dose of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors should be reduced accordingly.", 
    "89": "The aims of this study were to evaluate the influence of different coronary angiographic endpoints on the outcome of lipid intervention studies and to formulate a proposal for angiographic endpoint standardization. In recent angiographic intervention studies a confusing diversity in angiographic endpoints has been used to determine the outcome. In addition, differences in study populations (eg, bypass patients included or not) could influence results. This makes comparisons between studies cumbersome and raises the question to what extent the results of various studies may be subject to the selection of angiographic endpoints. The investigators compared three frequently used endpoints (mean segment diameter, minimum obstruction diameter, and % stenosis) in a group of 505 patients who had just finished a trial designed to assess the effect of cholesterol lowering by pravastatin. To exclude a potential bias this analysis was carried out at the time that the study was still blinded. They found poor intercorrelation coefficients for mean segment diameter calculated in different ways, ranging from 0.55 to 0.95, dependent on inclusion or exclusion of segments influenced by coronary angioplasty or bypass grafting and on whether or not a value of 0 was assumed for occluded segments and segments distal to occlusions. The correlation between mean segment diameter and minimum obstruction diameter was 0.79; between minimum obstruction diamete and % stenosis, 0.85; and between mean segment diameter and % stenosis, only 0.64. Different endpoints sometimes correlate poorly. This may lead to differences in results of angiographic intervention trials. The authors propose standardization by (1) using both mean sement diameter and minimum obstruction diameter as endpoints and (2) excluding from the primary analysis segments influenced by mechanical interventions.",

Renal blood flow was measured with an ultrasonic flowprobe, and glomerular filtration rate was measured by inulin clearance. The effect of lovastatin on pre- and postglomerular vessel diameters was also observed in a hydronephrotic kidney preparation by videomicroscopy.",

The increase in renal blood flow was mediated by preglomerular vasodilation (expressed as percent increase from baseline diameter, n = 20), 25% in the interlobular artery and 20% in the afferent arteriole (p < 0.05).", 
    "93": "In addition to its known lipid-lowering properties, lovastatin has a direct renal hemodynamic effect, increasing renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in normal nonpathologic kidneys. Lovastatin's selective preglomerular vasodilation may account for the observed increase in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Accordingly, this additional hemodynamic effect may be useful in preserving renal function in models of chronic renal failure.",

    "95": "SR-12813 (tetra-ethyl 2-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl-1, 1-bisphosphonate) lowers plasma cholesterol in five species. In this paper we investigate the underlying mechanism using Hep G2 cells. SR-12813 inhibited incorporation of tritiated water into cholesterol with an IC50 of 1.2 microM but had no effect on fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, SR-12813 reduced cellular 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity with an IC50 of 0.85 microM. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity was rapid with a T1/2 of 10 min. After a 16-h incubation with SR-12813, mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase and low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor were increased. The increased expression of LDL receptor translated into a higher LDL uptake, which can explain the primary hypocholesterolemic effect of SR-12813 in vivo. Western blot analysis indicated that the amount of HMG-CoA reductase protein rapidly decreased in the presence of SR-12813. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine showed that the T1/2 of HMG-CoA reductase degradation decreased in the presence of SR-12813 from 90 to 20 min. Pre-incubation with 50 microM of lovastatin did not prevent the effects of SR-12813 on HMG-CoA reductase degradation, indicating that the compound does not need mevalonate-derived regulators for its action. It is concluded that SR-12813 inhibits cholesterol synthesis mainly by an enhanced degradation of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "96": "Lovastatin and simvastatin are strong inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis in cultured human granulosa cells, as measured within 6 days after isolation, with IC50-values of respectively 27.0 and 18.2 nM obtained after 3.5 hours of incubation with the drugs. Pravastatin is a much weaker inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis (IC50-value of 977.8 nM) in these cells. Under these conditions inhibition of cholesterol synthesis had no influence on progesterone secretion into the medium which was probably due to the presence of large cholesterol pools in the cells. To deplete these pools, granulosa cells were cultured for 7 days after which the culture medium was changed into medium supplemented with 20% lipoprotein-depleted serum to deprive the cells of exogenous cholesterol. Additionally, 30 mIU of follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone per ml were added to stimulate the progesterone production and secretion, thereby decreasing the cholesteryl ester pools. After 48 h of incubation, culture was continued without hormones for another two days. Thereafter, the cells were preincubated for 24 h without or with 1 microM of lovastatin, simvastatin or pravastatin in medium containing lipoprotein-deficient serum and the above-mentioned hormones. This period is followed by incubation for another 24 h in the presence of [14C]acetate after which cells and media were collected for determination of 14C-labelled sterols synthesized and progesterone secreted into the media. Now, lovastatin and simvastatin, which strongly inhibited sterol synthesis, significantly attenuated the secretion of progesterone. One microM of pravastatin had no significant effect on sterol synthesis nor on progesterone secretion. When the latter experiment was performed under conditions in which exogenous cholesterol was provided in the form of human low density lipoproteins, no influence of the vastatins on progesterone secretion was observed. So under conditions in which the cholesterol pools were decreased, lovastatin and simvastatin attenuated the progesterone secretion, whereas pravastatin did not. When pools were filled by exogenous cholesterol, no effect on progesterone secretion by either of the drugs was observed.",

G(1)-synchronized MCF-7 cells, made quiescent by exposure to the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Simvastatin in estrogen-free medium, readily resume cell cycle progression upon stimulation with 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), even under conditions where polypeptide growth factor-triggered signal transduction pathways are inhibited by the continuous presence of Simvastatin in the culture medium. Under these conditions, cyclin D(1) gene transcription is transiently induced within the first 1-9 h of stimulation, as shown by the accumulation of cyclin D(1) mRNA and protein (p36(D(1))) in the cell and by enhanced expression of stably transfected D(1) promoter-luciferase hybrid genes. Estrogen-induced p36(D(1)) associates readily with p32(cdk2) and p34(cdk4), but not with p31(cdk5), which is however abundantly expressed in these cells. Only p36(D(1))-p34(cdk4) complexes are activated by E(2), as detected in cell extracts by immunoprecipitation with anti-D(1) antibodies followed by assessment of phosphotransferase activity toward the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene product and by analysis of p105(Rb) phosphorylation in vivo. An estrogen-responsive regulatory region has been mapped within the first 944 bp upstream of the transcriptional startsite of the human D(1) gene. Sequence analysis of this DNA region reveals that the cis-acting elements responsive to estrogen are likely to be different in this case from the canonical EREs.", 
    "104": "Elevated plasma cholesterol is a well recognised risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies have shown that a reduction in circulating cholesterol results in a reduced cardiovascular risk. The statins are a group of cholesterol lowering agents which act by inhibition of a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis; 3-hydroxy 3-methyliglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonate. In addition to their efficacy as cholesterol lowering agents, statins inhibit the proliferation, migration and signalling of vascular smooth muscle cells. Inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis and resultant reduction in prenylation of key cellular proteins such members of p21ras and p21rho families may underlie some of these effects.", 
    "105": "Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is an essential immunoregulating molecule that has recently been shown to have a growth stimulatory effect on Trypanosoma brucei brucei (T. b. brucei). The signalling pathway(s) involved during this triggering are unknown. Since the different products from the biosynthesis pathway utilizing mevalonate have several important cellular functions, ranging from cholesterol synthesis to growth control, we here investigate the possible role for the mevalonate pathway in IFN-gamma-driven parasite proliferation. Thus, lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase-inhibiting drug, was incubated at different concentrations in vitro with T. b. brucei. The parasites were then stimulated with a broad concentration range of rIFN-gamma. The effect on proliferation or growth was measured either by the tritium-labeled thymidine incorporation assay or by direct counting of parasites from the cultures using light microscopy. The maximum proliferative response was obtained with IFN-gamma at a concentration of 10(3) U/ml added to 10(6) parasites. This response was markedly decreased with lovastatin, even at a low concentration (0.1 mM). The effect of lovastatin was reversed by the addition of 10 mM mevalonate. IFN-gamma at a concentration of 10(4) U/ml showed no proliferative effect. Addition of mevalonate to this concentration of IFN-gamma gave a threefold increase in parasite proliferation. Our data suggest that a low concentration of IFN-gamma induces parasite growth, a high concentration has the opposite effect, and both these events are regulated by activity or inactivity of the mevalonate pathway.", 
    "106": "Hepatic excretion of non-bile acid organic anions is reported to be ATP-dependent and a defect of this transport has been reported in congenitally jaundiced rats, animal models of human Dubin-Johnson syndrome. To investigate the effect of the transmembrane pH gradient on hepatocyte canalicular membrane transport of ATP-dependent organic anions, uptake of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase-inhibiting organic anion, by hepatocyte canalicular membrane vesicles was observed in the presence or absence of transmembrane pH gradients. Uptake was assessed by a rapid filtration technique. ATP-dependent pravastatin uptake was stimulated in the presence of a transmembrane pH gradient (in > out) in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Uptake was dependent on both pravastatin and ATP concentrations and showed saturation kinetics. After intravenous injection of [14C]-pravastatin (0.3 mumol), 81% of the dose was excreted in the bile within 35 min in SD rats, whereas only 20% was excreted in the bile in Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rats. ATP and the pH gradient also co-stimulated the uptake of pravastatin in Eisai hyperbilirubinuria rats, although the K(m) was much higher and Vmax was much lower than corresponding values in SD rats. This coincided well with the marked reduction in vivo biliary excretion of pravastatin in jaundiced rats.", 
    "107": "Abrupt withdrawal of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is associated with increased excretion of cholesterol into bile, but this phenomenon has not been investigated in humans. In order to evaluate whether patients interrupting these hypolipidemic drugs are at increased risk of forming gallstones, pravastatin (40 mg twice a day) or placebo was randomly administered to 16 bile fistula patients for 5 days. Biliary lipid composition was determined in basal conditions and for 5 consecutive days after drug withdrawal. Both biliary cholesterol concentration and saturation increased significantly on the second day after pravastatin withdrawal, but tended to decrease thereafter. Biliary bile acids and phospholipids were not affected. This short-lasting effect on biliary cholesterol excretion was probably the result of a transient increase of hepatic cholesterol synthesis by the up-regulated HMG-CoA reductase in the absence of the inhibitory drug. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, also in humans, biliary cholesterol excretion could be dependent on the hepatic free cholesterol pool.", 
    "108": "The intercellular domains of the stratum corneum, which contain a mixture of cholesterol, free fatty acids, and ceramides, mediate both the epidermal permeability barrier and the transdermal delivery of both lipophilic and hydrophilic molecules. Prior studies have shown that each of the three key lipid classes is required for normal barrier function. For example, selective inhibition of either cholesterol, fatty acid, or ceramide synthesis in the epidermis delays barrier recovery rates after barrier perturbation of hairless mouse skin in vivo. In this study, we investigated the potential of certain inhibitors of lipid synthesis to enhance the transdermal delivery of lidocaine or caffeine as a result of their capacity to perturb barrier homeostasis. After acetone disruption of the barrier, the extent of lidocaine delivery and the degree of altered barrier function paralleled each other. Moreover, the further alteration in barrier function produced by either the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic acid (TOFA), the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor fluvastatin (FLU), or cholesterol sulfate (CS) resulted in a further increase in lidocaine absorption. Furthermore, coapplications of TOFA and CS together caused an additive increase in lidocaine uptake. Finally, a comparable increase in drug delivery occurred when the barrier was disrupted initially with DMSO instead of acetone; coapplications of TOFA and FLU together again delayed barrier recovery and increased drug delivery by about 8-fold vs delivery from a standard enhancing vehicle. Whereas these metabolic inhibitors also variably increased the octanol/water partitioning of the drugs studied (perhaps via complexion or pH alterations), physicochemical effects of the inhibitors alone did not alter drug uptake in intact skin; i.e., passive mechanisms alone cannot account for the net increase in drug delivery. Our results show that modulations of epidermal lipid biosynthesis, following application of conventional, chemical penetration enhancers, cause a further boost in drug delivery, attributable to the ability of these agents to alter both permeability barrier homeostasis and thermodynamics. This biochemical/metabolic approach provides a novel means to enhance transdermal drug delivery in conjunction with the concurrent or prior use of chemical enhancers.", 
    "109": "Several truly \"landmark' studies were presented during the 45th Annual Scientific Session of the American College of Cardiology (ACC). This report reviews studies of markers of atherosclerosis and some of the trials in endothelial dysfunction (TREND), lipid lowering (CARE), coronary angioplasty and unstable angina (EPILOG, CAPTURE, RESTORE), acute myocardial infarction (HERO, GUSTO 11b), post-myocardial infarction (EMIAT, CAMIAT), and heart failure (DIG trial).", 
    "110": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), cholesterol-lowering drugs that have not been approved for use in children and adolescents, may cause myopathy as a side effect. We compared the effects of three statins (simva-, prava- and lovastatin) in young rats to determine whether skeletal muscle of young animals is more susceptible than that of adults. We also evaluated whether the type of statin (lipophilic versus hydrophilic) determines the degree of muscle damage. Administration via chow of simvastatin (15 mg/kg of body weight/d) and lovastatin (43-55 mg/kg of body weight/d), both lipophilic, caused stunted growth, high creatine kinase (CK) activity in plasma, and severe myopathy. Statin doses that caused damage were much lower for young rats than for adults. Pravastatin (8-55 mg/kg of body weight/d), a hydrophilic drug, caused none of these symptoms. Histologic analysis of hind paw muscles of simvastatin-and lovastatin-treated rats showed abundant signs of damage (hypercontraction, fiber necrosis) in the extensor digitorum longus, correlating with the symptoms noted above. No cellular infiltrates were seen at the onset, pointing to a noninflammatory myopathy. Pravastatin-treated rats never showed signs of myopathy. Impaired DNA synthesis may explain why muscle toxicity is seen at lower doses in young, rapidly developing rats than in adult animals. The differences in muscle damage between the statins may be attributed to differences in lipophilicity and thus in tissue selectivity. Our results can be important when considering drug therapy in young patients with inherited lipoprotein disorders.", 
    "111": "Since plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations are inversely related to the development of atherosclerosis, induction of HDL after pharmacological treatment is considered of benefit. To study whether currently used hypolipidemic drugs affect HDL metabolism by modulating the expression of genes involved in HDL metabolism, liver and intestinal apolipoprotein (apo) AI, apo-AII and apo-AIV gene expression was evaluated in rats treated with different classes of hypolipidemic drugs, and correlated to the changes in plasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations. In rats, the most pronounced hypolipidemic effects were observed after treatment with the fibrates clofibrate and fenofibrate, which lowered plasma lipid, apo-AI and apo-AIV concentrations. This decrease was accompanied by lowered liver apo-AI, apo-AII and apo-AIV mRNA levels. None of the other compounds tested affected plasma cholesterol, whereas probucol and simvastatin decreased plasma triglyceride concentrations. Apo-AI and apo-AII mRNA remained constant after nicotinic acid and probucol, whereas liver apo-AIV mRNA levels decreased. Cholestyramine increased hepatic apo-AI and apo-AII, but not apo-AIV mRNA levels. Simvastatin treatment increased apo-AI mRNA nearly threefold, whereas apo-AII and apo-AIV decreased by more than 50%. Similarly as after cholestyramine, the alteration in hepatic apo-AI mRNA levels did not result in changed plasma apo-AI concentrations. Remarkably, none of the drugs tested significantly affected intestinal apolipoprotein mRNA levels. These results indicate that hypolipidemic drugs may act on plasma lipoprotein metabolism by regulating apolipoprotein gene expression. Further studies in humans and primates are therefore warranted.", 
    "112": "The H.E.L.P. procedure (heparin-induced extracorporeal low density lipoprotein: fibrinogen precipitation) provides an efficient means of lowering high concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in severe hypercholesterolemia, with the additional effect of lowering lipoprotein(a) and fibrinogen, while high density lipoprotein levels are increased during long-term treatment. The H.E.L.P. treatment also significantly improves plasma viscosity, erythrocyte aggregation and erythrocyte filtration. Overall treatment tolerance is very good, and no major complications have been observed after approximately 70,000 single treatment sessions. Some patients are treated for more than 10 years. In combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, a mean interval value of -75% to -80% for LDL as compared to the starting concentration may be achieved. The treatment has the advantage that the patient is not exposed to foreign proteins or compounds, with their attendant immunological problems. It displays a high degree of reproducibility and a standardized capacity, guaranteeing a constant therapy independent of the clinic or institution performing the treatment. The clinical experience with the H.E.L.P. system has proved its clinical utility--there is a regression of coronary heart disease, a decrease in coronary heart disease events, and a remarkable improvement in acute as well as chronic impairment of microcirculation. For the future, the availability of this safe and efficient apheresis technique may provide help for many patients who previously could not be treated adequately.",

    "114": "A cross-sectional analysis was conducted at baseline of 4159 participants in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) Study. Symptomatic diffuse atherosclerosis was defined as a history of MI plus lower extremity or cerebrovascular atherosclerosis or claudication by Rose questionnaire.", 
    "115": "The prevalence of symptomatic diffuse atherosclerosis was 12.9%; 353 participants (8.5%) had lower extremity disease and 219 (5.3%) had cerebrovascular disease. After controlling for other variables, diffuse atherosclerosis was associated with age (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.44 per ten-year increase), systolic blood pressure (OR = 1.13 per 10 mm Hg increase), a history of multiple myocardial infarctions (OR = 1.76), diabetes (OR = 1.76), hypertension (OR = 1.38), reduced exercise performance (OR = 1.55), current smoking status (OR = 2.87), and lower alcohol intake (OR = 0.97 per drink per week). There was no association with race, gender, or lipid levels.",

All patients were taking a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor as monotherapy for treatment of high blood cholesterol for a minimum of 1 year. Medical charts and laboratory and pharmacy computer databases were utilized to gather information regarding the patients' medical history, treatment history, relevant laboratory tests, and medication refill profile.", 
    "119": "The majority of patients, 73%, were secondary prevention patients. Only 33% of the 90 subjects met the LDL cholesterol goal recommended by the NCEP. For the secondary prevention patients, only 24% met goal LDL. Even when the stringency of the NCEP guidelines was reduced by 20% (goal LDL < 120 mg/dL), 50% of the secondary prevention patients were still inadequately treated. Only 2 of the 90 patients were on maximal dosage regimens. Sixty-seven percent of patients had annual lipid panels and 49% had annual liver panels. Forty-five percent of patients followed by nonphysicians met goal LDL while only 29% and 31% of patients followed by attending physicians and residents/fellows met goal LDL, respectively. In addition, patients followed by nonphysicians were monitored more closely for efficacy and toxicity of the medications.",

    "121": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to reduce glomerular injury in different models of progressive renal damage. The transcription factor NF-kappaB plays a major role in the induced expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation and inflammatory responses that could be important in the pathogenesis of glomerular injury. We therefore examined the effects of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin on NFkappaB activation in human mesangial cells.", 
    "122": "Cultured human mesangial cells were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence or absence of lovastatin. NF-kappaB activity was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).",

Treatment of mesangial cells with lovstatin in the presence of exogenous cholesterol resulted in a significant reduction of the LPS-induced NF-kappaB activity. In the presence of either mevalonate or the mevalonate metabolite farnesyl pyrophosphate, the lovastatin inhibition of NF-kappaB activation was substantially reversed, supporting a role for mevalonate metabolites in LPS-induced mesangial cell NF-kappaB activation.",

    "125": "Atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries is the most common cause of death in the United States for persons over the age of 45. Dyslipidemia is one of the risk factors for the development of coronary atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that treating dyslipidemia in persons with coronary atherosclerosis may decrease morbidity and mortality.", 
    "126": "A meta-analysis of 33 studies on the clinical and angiographic benefits of treating dyslipidemia in the prevention of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease was performed. These benefits are quantitated in the form of \"number needed to treat\" (NNT) as an estimate of the public health benefit. The NNT is defined as the number of people that need to be treated to prevent one event.", 
    "127": "Treatment of dyslipidemia in persons with multiple atherosclerosis risk factors alone, ie, primary prevention, was effective in preventing myocardial infarction and all-cause death. In six trials of primary prevention, excluding the British cooperative trial using clofibrate, the NNT was 53 to prevent a nonfatal MI and 190 to prevent all-cause death (4.8 years treatment with total cholesterol reduction of 15%). Treatment of dyslipidemia in people with known atherosclerosis, ie, secondary and tertiary prevention, was also effective in preventing myocardial infarctions and death from all causes. For 23 trials of secondary and tertiary prevention, the NNT was 37 to prevent death from any cause (4.9 years treatment with total cholesterol reduction of 18%). In the trials with quantitative angiography, the NNT was 7 to prevent progression of coronary atherosclerosis and 10 to induce regression of coronary atherosclerosis (2.5 years treatment with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction of 28%). Similar benefits were observed in those trials employing HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. Benefits may be similar with niacin or dietary therapy, but these therapies did not reach significance in all categories of benefits, potentially due to beta error. These treatment benefits are comparable to other secondary prevention measures such as aspirin or beta blockers. The benefits appeared to extend to persons over 65, with less clearly defined benefits for women.", 
    "128": "These results support the overall clinical benefit of treating dyslipidemia, both in persons with and without known atherosclerosis.", 
    "129": "Sitosterolemia is a genetic disorder characterized by sitosterol accumulation in plasma and clinically accelerated atherosclerosis. Under a condition of metabolic control with a 30% fat, low-sitosterol diet, we compared the effects of monotherapy and dual-drug treatment with lovastatin and cholestyramine on plasma sterol parameters and endogenous cholesterol synthesis in a homozygous sitosterolemic patient with concomitant heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), her obligate heterozygous father, and hyperlipidemic control subjects. We found that for both the sitosterolemic homozygote and heterozygote, cholestyramine plus lovastatin dual therapy proved not to be superior to either drug treatment alone. In the homozygous patient, cholestyramine accounted for the decrease of plasma sterol (ie, lovastatin was ineffective), whereas in the heterozygote, lovastatin represented the margin of difference (ie, low-dose cholestyramine was relatively ineffective). Thus, the best treatment option for this homozygote child and her heterozygote father appears to be monotherapy with cholestyramine and lovastatin, respectively. Stimulation by bile acid malabsorption produced a dramatic decrease of plasma sterols in the homozygote, without increasing endogenous cholesterol synthesis, but this therapy was ineffective in the heterozygote. Decreasing endogenous cholesterol synthesis with lovastatin was effective in the heterozygote, but ineffective in the homozygote. In suspected sitosterolemia, a poor sterol response to lovastatin and a dramatic response to cholestyramine may differentiate homozygous from heterozygous and other familial forms of hyperlipidemia.", 
    "130": "The formation of oxysterols in cultured human fibroblasts and their physiological roles as intracellular regulators of cholesterol production have been investigated. In the presence of low density lipoproteins (LDL), normal fibroblasts converted LDL cholesterol to 27hydroxycholesterol, which was further metabolized to 7alpha, 27-dihydroxycholesterol, 7alpha,27-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoic acid. Autooxidation products of cholesterol contaminating the lipoproteins were also metabolized in the cells. 7alpha-Hydroxycholesterol was converted to 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one prior to 27-hydroxylation and further oxidation to 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoic acid. 7beta-Hydroxycholesterol and 7-oxocholesterol were 27-hydroxylated and then oxidized to C27-acids. Oxidation of the 7beta-hydroxy group also occurred. 25-Hydroxycholesterol was 7alpha-hydroxylated and further oxidized to 7alpha,25-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. 25-Hydroxylation of sterols was observed only under specific conditions. In contrast, only small amounts of oxysterols were formed in virus-transformed human fibroblasts when incubated with lipoproteins. This was due to very low activities of the 27- and 7alpha-hydroxylating enzymes. The rate of oxidation at C-3 was also decreased moderately. A defective suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase by LDL and autooxidation products of cholesterol observed in the transformed fibroblasts could be caused by the deficiencies of the sterol-metabolizing enzymes, since these cells responded normally to the sterol metabolites 7alpha,27-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, 7alpha, 25-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and 27-hydroxy-7-oxo-cholesterol. These metabolites, which all possessed an oxo group with a conjugated double bond in the steroid nucleus and a hydroxyl group in the side chain, did not seem to require further metabolism in order to be active. An impaired response to LDL was also seen in other human tumor cells, including breast carcinoma, colonic carcinoma, and malignant melanoma cells. Common to all the malignant cells was an intracellular shortage of 7alpha, 27-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one caused by a decreased formation or an increased metabolism.", 
    "131": "Hyperlipidemia is an important complication of kidney transplantation affecting up to 74% of recipients. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are reported to provide safe and effective treatment for this problem. A recent study suggests that pravastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, also decreases the incidence of both clinically severe acute rejection episodes and natural killer cell cytotoxicity after orthotopic heart transplantation. We have performed a prospective randomized pilot study of the effect of pravastatin on these same parameters after cadaveric kidney transplantation. Graft recipients were randomized to receive pravastatin after transplantation or no pravastatin (24 patients in each group) in addition to routine cyclosporine and prednisone immunosuppression. Lipid levels, acute rejection episodes and serial natural killer cell cytotoxicities were followed for 4 months after the transplant. At the end of the study period, pravastatin had successfully controlled mean total cholesterol levels (202.6 +/- 9.3 vs. 236.5 +/- 11.9 mg/dl, P < 0.02), LDL levels (107.9 +/- 6.6 vs.149.6 +/- 10.7 mg/dl, P < 0.002), and triglyceride levels (118.8 +/- 14.2 vs. 157.2 +/- 13.8 mg/dl, P < 0.05). In addition, the pravastatin-treated group experienced a reduction in the incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes (25% vs. 58%, P = 0.01), the incidence of multiple rejections episodes (P < 0.05), and the use of both pulse methylprednisolone (P = 0.01) and OKT3 (P = 0.02). Mean natural killer cell cytotoxicity was similarly reduced (11.3 +/- 1.6 vs. 20.0 +/- 2.0% lysis of K562 target cells, P < 0.002). These data suggest that pravastatin exerts an additional immunosuppressive effect in kidney transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine-based immunosuppression."
