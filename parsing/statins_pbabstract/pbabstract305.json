This prospective, placebo-controlled, crossover trial evaluated the effect of atorvastatin on various lipid parameters including remnant lipoproteins and small, dense-LDL cholesterol levels. Forty-five subjects were enrolled in the study. These subjects fell into three distinct lipid patterns: atherogenic dyslipidemia, isolated hypercholesterolemia, and mixed dyslipidemia. Regardless of the baseline lipid profile, atorvastatin (10 mg q x d) reduced levels of remnant lipoproteins by 25%, LDL-cholesterol by 27%, and the three LDL subfractions by 23%-28% (p<0.0001 for all). Combining all patients, atorvastatin did not significantly alter the overall LDL subfraction pattern; however, in the isolated hypercholesterolemia group, the proportion of LDL present as the small, dense fraction increased by 23% (p=0.01) with treatment, whereas it did not change significantly in the other two groups. Overall, atorvastatin reduced triglycerides by 18% and apolipoprotein-B100 by 23% and increased high-density lipoproteins by 6.2% (p<0.001 all). Since atorvastatin is known to reduce the risk for coronary heart disease events and these data suggest that it does not appear to alter the LDL subfraction pattern, it is unclear whether or not the latter is an important risk predictor independent of LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Increased attention should be paid to absolute concentrations of LDL subfraction cholesterol, which may be a more sensitive indicator of coronary heart disease risk than total LDL or an LDL pattern.",

Because citrinin is a mycotoxin and possesses nephrotoxic and hepatoxic effects, it has a negative impact on the acceptance of red mold rice by people. In this research, a simple and quick selection method for mutant strains with low citrinin production was designed based on the fact that citrinin possesses antibacterial activity for Bacillus subtilis and will form an inhibition zone around the colony of the Monascus strain. The mutant strain M. purpureus N 301 only produced 0.23 +/- 0.01 ppm citrinin, which was 50% less than that of the parent strain, and the monacolin K production was 481.29 +/- 7.98 ppm and maintained 91% productivity. M. purpureus N 310, the other mutant strain, produced 0.27 +/- 0.01 ppm citrinin, which was 41% less than that of the parent strain, and the monacolin K production was 526.29 +/- 5.54 ppm, which showed no significant changes when compared with the parent strain.

    "29": "Dyslipidaemia associated with the treatment of HIV infection, particularly with the use of protease inhibitors (PIs), can raise cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels to the thresholds indicated for intervention. Recent evidence from epidemiological studies has shown that there are correlations between antiretroviral drug use and increased risks for, and incidences of, cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease. The primary goals of dyslipidaemia therapy for HIV patients are reductions of both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and markedly elevated TG levels. Dietary strategies and exercise programs may be tried, although these have shown inconsistent results. The two options for drug therapy are switching antiretroviral agents and using lipid-lowering drugs. Each approach is associated with advantages and limitations, and the need to maintain viral suppression must be balanced with the need to treat abnormal lipid levels. Most drug switches replace the PI component with drugs from another antiretroviral class. Selection of drug therapy for lipid lowering depends on the type of dyslipidaemia predominating and the potential for drug interactions. The use of the statins pravastatin and atorvastatin is recommended for the treatment of patients with elevated LDL-C levels and gemfibrozil or fenofibrate for patients with elevated TG concentrations. Development of new PIs with more favourable effects on the lipid profile should be of benefit.",

Half of the study group was treated with a lipid lowering drug while the other half was randomly assigned to placebo. This study cohort afforded the opportunity to look at ECG morphology as a marker of risk. All 12-lead ECGs in the study were processed by the Glasgow Program and automated Minnesota Coding was also undertaken. All computer outputs were reviewed to exclude errors due to technically unsatisfactory recordings. Multiple variables were studied. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were undertaken to determine those electrocardiographic and clinical parameters of predictive value with respect to the primary endpoint of fatal or non fatal myocardial infarction. Those ST-T variables with additional prognostic value in the multivariate analysis, which included the clinical parameters, were used to develop a risk score. Although many ECG measures were of prognostic value in a univariate analysis, only rate, frontal T axis and T+ amplitude in lead I were of significance in a multivariate analysis which included clinical data. With respect to QT dispersion, while it was shown that there was an increased risk for those with QT dispersion exceeding 44 ms (RR 1.38, CI 1.02 - 1.81 P = 0.034) the receiver operating characteristic curve was virtually a straight line. The risk equation also demonstrated that there was as much prognostic value in the use of age and smoking history alone as there was in ECG plus age combined. The conclusion drawn is that the prognostic value of ECG variables has to be considered carefully in the light of other available data.",

Direct measurement of LDL cholesterol gives a correct measure independent of the triglyceride level up to 13.0 mmol/L. LDL cholesterol levels may be low despite high total cholesterol levels and high triglyceride levels. Diet and lifestyle intervention is important. Blood sugar control is crucial. Statins are the first choice of drugs in combined hyperlipidaemia. Isolated hypertriglyceridaemia >10 mmol/L represents a large risk for pancreatitis. Purified omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates and eventually niacin are the drugs of choice in this condition. If LDL cholesterol levels are elevated, statins should also be considered.

An acceptable theory is that the acute coronary syndrome is caused by rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque with superimposed thrombus, which is a complex process and involving a number of different stages. Previous studies indicated that inflammation is one of the most important features of vulnerable plaque, and occurs in most vulnerable plaque, comprised of monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes in both the cap and in the adventitia. This is supported by evidence that reduction in serum inflammatory marker levels, such as C-reactive protein, significantly decreased coronary events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. A large number of investigations have demonstrated that administration of statin could modify C-reactive protein concentrations with a concurrent fall in cardiovascular events. Our recent data indicated that reduction of inflammatory markers could be achieved within 24 h following a single dose of statin administration after admission in patients with coronary artery disease. Based on the available evidence and in light of the new understanding that statins have pleiotropic effects, especially as a potent anti-inflammatory agent, the statins, like aspirin, should be clinically given as early as possible in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "47": "Statins have very important influences on adipocyte physiology, particularly via their effects on sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), which are extremely important transcription factors for the regulation of adipocyte physiology. SREBP-1c activation in fat cell by the cytosolic cholesterol deprivation through HMG-reductase inhibition is responsible for most of the beneficial effects of statins. Glucose and lipid excess, and oxidative overload coming with energy dense nutrition, which might be deleterious, can be removed from the circulation by adipo-lipogenetic enhancement through the activated SREBP-1c. SREBP-1c causes formation of new small and competent adipocytes, which are insulin and leptin sensitive. Thus, adipocytes gain the ability of fat storing, and much more importantly, fat-burning machines. Statins already have a large and growing number of indications in the treatment of atherovascular diseases. General mechanism for the action of statins is their inhibitory effects on 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl CoA reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, particularly in the liver. Recently, the beneficial effects of statins beyond their cholesterol lowering, which are called pleiotropic effects, have been the focus of great attention. Certain characteristics of the statin molecule itself have been proposed to explain these effects. Adipocytes are in the very heart of metabolic regulations. Therefore, the important elements of the pleiotropic effects of statins occur through executive improvements on impaired adipocyte functions by the activation of SREBP-1c.", 
    "48": "Many possible risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been investigated, with only a very few showing positive associations and none defining the etiology of the neurodegenerative disease. The presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA in the brain, coupled with apolipoprotein E allele e4 (ApoE e4), has been suggested to confer an increased risk for AD. Studies have shown that pathogens, including viruses, utilize clathrin-independent endocytosis, i.e., lipid rafts that contain cholesterol, as part of their structure. Moreover, cholesterol-lowering statins have recently been linked with a reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia. We, therefore, posit that long-term statin therapy protects individuals from AD by reducing the neuronal spread of HSV-1 via lipid raft domain pathways. Although the mechanism by which statins reduce AD risk is unknown, they reduce the amount of cholesterol in the plasma membrane and, thus, may decrease the availability of lipid raft pathways to spread HSV-1 within the brain.", 
    "49": "Previous studies suggest that treatment with statins reduce beta amyloid (Abeta) deposition in brains of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may reduce the prevalence of AD in humans. Since lipophilicity influences the biological efficacy of statins, we compared the effects of lovastatin, a lipophilic statin, to effects of the hydrophilic pravastatin on amyloid processing and inflammatory responses in brain. Three-month old TgCRND8 mice expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (mHuAPP) were treated daily with various doses of either statin. After 1 month, levels of cerebral soluble and fibrillar Abeta peptides, soluble sAPPalpha, and inflammatory cytokines were measured. Both statins caused dose-dependent reductions in total Abeta peptides with parallel increases in total sAPPalpha. At all doses, slightly greater effects were observed with lovastatin than with pravastatin. In contrast, only lovastatin significantly increased levels of IL-1beta and of TNFalpha in a dose-dependent manner. Lovastatin, but not pravastatin, decreased succinic dehydrogenase and increased lactate dehydrogenase activities in skeletal muscle and increased TUNEL staining in liver. Our data demonstrate that both statins shift the balance of APP processing from excessive beta-toward the normal alpha-cleavage while reducing the total amyloid burden in TgCRND8 brain and that lovastatin, but not pravastatin, potentiates cerebral inflammation and is associated with liver and muscle histotoxicity in these animals. These data show that pravastatin can reduce amyloid burden without potentiating inflammatory responses in brain and, therefore, may have a wider dose-range of safety than have lipophilic statins in the treatment or prevention of AD.",

According to one trial, rosuvastatin does not appear to be more effective than atorvastatin in homozygous forms. (5) In clinical trials the adverse effects of rosuvastatin were similar to those of other statins, with the exception of renal adverse effects. We don't know whether rosuvastatin is more or less likely than other statins to cause rhabdomyolysis. (6) Clinical trials reported some cases of proteinuria and renal failure suggesting there is a need for more thorough assessment in long-term trials. (7) In practice, statins with the best-documented benefits (simvastatin and pravastatin) should be used first for cardiovascular prevention in patients with hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "55": "Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with an increased risk of coronary events. The levels of CRP and other inflammatory markers are significantly elevated in patients with unstable angina. We hypothesised that a high-dose statin therapy alone or with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, administered before coronary diagnostic or invasive procedures, can attenuate CRP elevation after the procedure and, consequently, more effectively reduce the rate of coronary events.", 
    "56": "All patients with unstable angina in class III and IIB according to Braunwald classification were considered for inclusion in the present study. Finally, 60 patients with elevated CRP level (>3 mg/l) were randomised to three groups of pharmacological treatment before coronary angiography and subsequent angioplasty. Patients from group A received placebo, patients from group B - 80 mg of atorvastatin, and patients from group C - 80 mg of atorvastatin and 25 mg of rofecoxib. The levels of CRP were measured at baseline, after 3 days of therapy and 48 hours after invasive coronary procedure.", 
    "57": "The mean baseline CRP level in group A was 5.67+/-2.82 mg/l, in group B - 4.7+/-1.32 mg/l, and in group C - 6.78+/-2.56 mg/l (NS). After three days of pharmacological treatment, the mean CRP level was 5.82+/-2.69 mg/l in group A (NS compared with baseline) and was significantly reduced in group B to 2.5+/-1.37 mg/l and in group C to 3.01+/-1.57 mg/l (p<0.0013 compared with group A). Measurements performed 48 hours after the procedure revealed a marked CRP level increase in group A (up to 24.54+/-5.48 mg/l) and a much lower increase in groups B and C (up to 3.02+/-2.0 mg/l and 7.31+/-2.96 mg/l, respectively).", 
    "58": "High-dose statin therapy alone or in combination with COX-2 inhibitor, administered before invasive coronary procedure in patients with unstable angina, rapidly lowers CRP levels. This therapy also reduces a marked CRP elevation typically occurring after invasive coronary intervention. Attenuation of inflammatory reaction may be crucial for the reduction of coronary events following invasive coronary interventions.", 
    "59": "We identify berberine (BBR), a compound isolated from a Chinese herb, as a new cholesterol-lowering drug. Oral administration of BBR in 32 hypercholesterolemic patients for 3 months reduced serum cholesterol by 29%, triglycerides by 35% and LDL-cholesterol by 25%. Treatment of hyperlipidemic hamsters with BBR reduced serum cholesterol by 40% and LDL-cholesterol by 42%, with a 3.5-fold increase in hepatic LDLR mRNA and a 2.6-fold increase in hepatic LDLR protein. Using human hepatoma cells, we show that BBR upregulates LDLR expression independent of sterol regulatory element binding proteins, but dependent on ERK activation. BBR elevates LDLR expression through a post-transcriptional mechanism that stabilizes the mRNA. Using a heterologous system with luciferase as a reporter, we further identify the 5' proximal section of the LDLR mRNA 3' untranslated region responsible for the regulatory effect of BBR. These findings show BBR as a new hypolipidemic drug with a mechanism of action different from that of statin drugs.", 
    "60": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors - HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) have been approved for the treatment of lipid disorders. Recently, in vivo studies with experimental animals and in vitro studies indicated a possible role for statins in the treatment of malignancies. Inhibition of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase results in decreased farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of several proteins essential for cellular proliferation and survival. Inhibition of Ras farnesylation was originally thought to be the mechanism that mediates statin-induced effects in cancer. Consequently, specific inhibitors of the enzyme farnesyltransferase (FTIs) were developed. Currently, the mechanisms that mediate statin- and FTI-induced antitumour effects are questioned. It remains unclear which proteins and signal transduction cascades are involved. This review focuses on the effects and possible therapeutic application of statins and FTIs. Antitumour properties such as induction of growth arrest and apoptosis, inhibition of metastasis and inhibition of angiogenesis are discussed. Furthermore, the mechanisms of statin- and farnesyltransferase inhibitor-induced effects and the involvement of a number of cellular components (such as farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins, the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway, the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase signalling pathway, and cell cycle regulatory proteins) are reviewed. In addition, clinical and epidemiological data with respect to statins and farnesyltransferase inhibitors are summarised. We propose that inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway are particularly effective when administered in combination with other drugs. Therefore, the mechanisms and effects of combined therapy of statins or farnesyltransferase inhibitors with chemotherapeutics, biphosphonates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, specific inhibitors of geranylgeranyltransferase and inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity are discussed.", 
    "61": "Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and diltiazem, a calcium antagonist, were investigated in 7 male and 4 female patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. The patients were given, for one in a three consecutive 4-week periods, oral simvastatin (5 mg/day), oral simvastatin (5 mg/day) combined with diltiazem (90 mg/day), and then oral diltiazem (90 mg/day), respectively. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve up to 6 hours post-dose (AUC0-6h) and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of the drugs, serum lipid profiles, blood pressures and liver functions were assessed on the last day of each of the three 4-week periods. After the combined treatment period, Cmax of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor was elevated from 7.8 +/- 2.6 ng/ml to 15.4 +/- 7.9 ng/ml (P < 0.01) and AUC0-6h from 21.7 +/- 4.9 ng x hr/ml to 43.3 +/- 23.4 ng x hr/ml (P < 0.01), while Cmax of diltiazem was decreased from 74.2 +/- 36.4 ng/ml to 58.6 +/- 18.9 ng/ml (P < 0.05) and its AUC0-6h from 365 +/- 153 ng x hr/ml to 287 +/- 113 ng x hr/ml (P < 0.01). Compared to simvastatin monotherapy, combined treatment further reduced LDL-cholesterol levels by 9%, from 129 +/- 16 mg/dl to 119 +/- 17 mg/dl (P < 0.05). No adverse events were observed throughout the study. These apparent pharmacokinetic interactions, namely the increase of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor concentration by diltiazem and the decrease of diltiazem concentration by simvastatin, enhance the cholesterol-lowering effects of simvastatin during combined treatment.",

Fifty-one percent of patients were women, the mean (SD) age was 57 (12) years, and 19% had a documented history of atherosclerotic disease. Over 6 weeks, rosuvastatin significantly reduced non-HDL-C, apo B, and all lipid and apolipoprotein ratios assessed, compared with milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin and milligram-equivalent or higher doses of simvastatin and pravastatin (all, P < 0.002). Rosuvastatin reduced non-HDL-C by 42.0% to 50.9% compared with 34.4% to 48.1% with atorvastatin, 26.0% to 41.8% with simvastatin, and 18.6% to 27.4% with pravastatin.

Rosuvastatin enabled significantly more patients to achieve the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) goals for LDL-C with lower doses (P < 0.05). Rosuvastatin was well tolerated. Incidences of myopathy and liver function test abnormalities were rare and comparable to those of other statins. Because it is not metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 enzymes, rosuvastatin had fewer clinically significant drug interactions compared with other statins.

Recent evidence suggests the need for an even lower LDL-C goal than that being recommended by the NCEP Based on the studies included in this review, rosuvastatin may help patients achieve optimal goals early with lower dosages, thus reducing the need for dose titration or combination therapy.", 
    "72": "Observational studies suggested that the progression of carotid atherosclerosis and plaques might be an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, prior researches of different dosage of statins therapy on the progression of carotid atherosclerosis in patients had small sample sizes and different the results. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins therapy on the rate of carotid atherosclerosis progression through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We searched MEDLINE (1980-September 2003), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, EMBASE (1985-September 2003), Science Citation Index and PUBMED (updated through December 2003). Additional articles were obtained from reference lists of relevant reviews and papers in manual searches. Ten studies (eight studies between statins and placebo, two studies between aggressive statins and conventional therapy) were included. Two reviewers extracted abstracts, and appraised the Jadad Score for Grading Quality of Randomized Controlled Trials independently, and discrepancies were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. We analyzed the 10 trials with 3443 individuals age range from 30 to 70 years old and follow-up for 1-4 years. Eight studies showed that the rates of carotid IMT progression were consistently significantly different between statins and placebo, the Z score for overall effect of IMT was 10.41 (P<0.00001), Total 95%CI of weighted mean difference (WMD) between two groups was -0.02235 [-0.02656, -0.01614] (mm/y), the chi(2)-test for heterogeneity of IMT between eight studies was 685.33 (P<0.00001), two studies between aggressive statins and conventional statins demonstrated that the Z score for overall effect of IMT was 15.85 (P<0.00001), total 95%CI of WMD between two groups was -0.06326 [-0.07108, -0.05544], chi(2)-test for heterogeneity of IMT between two studies was 3.75 (P=0.05). Conventional statins were not significantly different of adverse events and withdrawal than placebo (P>0.05). Our findings suggest that conventional statins therapy are efficient and safe to decrease the rate of carotid atherosclerosis progression in a long-term, and aggressive statins may provide superior efficacy for carotid atherosclerosis regression.", 
    "73": "We have investigated the association between APOE genotypes and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in a cohort of approximately 600 individuals who were candidates for statin therapy. An association had been previously reported between the APOE3 allele and elevated CRP levels. That study only examined men. We have reproduced that association in men and have extended the finding to women. We also investigated the effect of the interaction between APOE genotype and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) status on CRP levels, adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and other covariates. BMI and HRT are also significant predictors of CRP, as previously reported. The effect of HRT is strong enough that the contribution of APOE genotype is no longer statistically significant among women on HRT. We also demonstrate that the presence or absence of the single SNP Cysl30Arg (which distinguishes APOE4 from APOE2 and APOE3) is sufficient to determine whether an individual is predisposed to higher or lower CRP levels. Essentially, the presence of one or two copies of APOE4 is associated with a reduction of CRP levels by approximately 34% relative to individuals with zero copies (1.73 mg/L for subjects with one or two copies versus 2.63 mg/L for subjects with zero copies of APOE4). We also tested previously reported associations between CRP levels and polymorphisms in the CRP and IL6 genes. These associations were not reproduced in our cohort.", 
    "74": "Despite the benefit of statin therapy in the prevention of coronary heart disease, a considerable inter-individual variation exists in its response. It is well recognized that genetic variation can contribute to differences in drug disposition and, consequently, clinical efficacy at the population level. Pharmacogenetics, exploring genetic polymorphisms that influence response to drug therapy, may one day allow the clinician to customize treatment strategies for patients in order to improve the success rate of drug therapies. To date, 41 studies have investigated the relationships between common genetic variants and response to statin therapy in terms of lipid effects and clinical outcomes; 16 candidate genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism and 3 in pharmacokinetics. APOE is the most extensively studied locus, and absolute difference in LDL cholesterol reduction across genotypes remained 3-6%. Moreover, none of the associations was striking enough to justify genetic analysis in clinical practice. Reported data have suggested that larger studies (>1000 participants) or combination analyses with >2 different polymorphisms would enable us to find clinically or biologically meaningful difference, which could be assumed as >10% absolute difference, and that genes influencing cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver, such as ABCG5/G8, CYP7A1, HMGCR, would be good candidates for future studies.", 
    "75": "Except functioning as lipid-lowering agents, HMG-CoA inhibitors, statins, are good tools to clarify the signaling role of small G proteins. In this study, we found in murine RAW264.7 macrophages, statins within 1-30 microM stimulated COX-2 gene transcription and PGE(2) formation, displaying potencies as lovastatin > fluvastatin > atorvastatin > pravastatin. Transfection experiments with COX-2 promoter construct showed the necessity of C/EBPbeta and CRE promoter sites, but not NF-kappaB promoter site. Effects of statins on the activation of COX-2 promoter, induction of COX-2 protein, and PGE(2) production were all prevented by mevalonate and prenylated metabolites, FPP and GGPP. Consistent with the effect of statins, manumycin A, farnesyltransferase inhibitor, and geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor increased PGE(2) production and COX-2 induction. Likewise, toxin B, an inhibitor of Rho family members, caused a prominent COX-2 induction. Results also indicated that tyrosine kinase, ERK, and p38 MAPK play essential roles in statin action. Taken together, these results not only demonstrate a unique action of statins in the upregulation of COX-2 expression in macrophages, but also suggest a negative role controlled by small G proteins in COX-2 gene regulation. Removal of this negative control by impairing G protein prenylation with statins leads to MAPKs activation and promotes COX-2 gene expression through the activation at CRE and C/EBPbeta sites.", 
    "76": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors significantly improve survival in patients with atherosclerosis. Although ACE inhibitors reduce local angiotensin II (AngII) formation, serine proteases form AngII to an enormous amount independently from ACE. Therefore, our study concentrates on the effect of the ACE-inhibitor ramiprilat on chemokine release, AngII receptor (ATR) expression, and NF-kappaB activity in monocytes stimulated with AngII.", 
    "77": "AngII-induced upregulation of IL-8 and MCP-1 protein and RNA in monocytes was inhibited by the AT1R-blocker losartan, but not by the AT2R-blocker PD 123.319. Ramiprilat dose-dependently suppressed AngII-induced upregulation of IL-8 and MCP-1. The suppressive effect of ramiprilat on AngII-induced chemokine production and release was in part caused by downregulation of NF-kappaB, but more by a selective and highly significant reduced expression of AT1 receptors as shown in monocytes and endothelial cells.", 
    "78": "In our study we demonstrated for the first time that ramiprilat reduced expression of AT1R in monocytes and endothelial cells. In addition, ramiprilat downregulated NF-kappaB activity and thereby reduced the AngII-induced release of IL-8 and MCP-1 in monocytes. This antiinflammatory effect, at least in part, may contribute to the clinical benefit of the ACE inhibitor in the treatment of coronary artery disease.", 
    "79": "Statins are highly effective in lowering TC and LDL-C but the increasing of HDL-C is modest and the cost of long-term treatment is too high. On the other hand it is known that the association of H2 receptor blockers increases the plasmatic level of statins, and moderate alcohol consumption increases HDL-C. The purpose of the study was to compare the effect of statins alone and in association with either H2 receptor blockers or alcohol upon serum lipids in dyslipidemic patients. Three groups of dyslipidemic patients were studied, each of them consisting of 20 patients. The group A was treated with simvastatin 20 mg/day, the group B with simvastatin 20 mg/day + ranitidine 150 mg/day and the group C with simvastatin 20 mg/day + 30 g alcohol/day. Before and after two weeks treatment TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG were determined in each patient. For the group A patients the studied lipid fractions were modified into the limits described by the literature; for the group B patients, the decreasing of LDL-C was significantly, higher than for A group; for the group C patients, the incresing of HDL-C was significantly, higher than for A group, after two week alcohol consumption. In conclusions, the association of H2 receptor blockers increases the effect of statins upon dyslipidemia and the association of statins with moderate alcohol consumption increases the effect of statins upon HDL-C but the clinical implication has to be established.", 
    "80": "Since endothelial dysfunction may significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of hypertension and its complications, its modification seems to be a very attractive means to favourably affect the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients. However, not all antihypertensive drugs consistently improve endothelial dysfunction. While first-generation beta-blockers showed contrasting or null effects on endothelial function, newer beta-blockers of the third generation, such as carvedilol and nebivolol, seem to be provided with specific endothelium-mediated vasodilating effects. Calcium channel blockers are generally able to increase endothelium-dependent vasodilation in several vascular beds, in patients with essential hypertension, probably through multiple mechanisms. Most studies have shown thatACE inhibitors favourably affect endothelial function mainly in the subcutaneous, epicardial and renal circulation, not only by inhibiting the effects of angiotensin II on the endothelium, but also by enhancing bradykinin-induced vasodilation, probably a hyperpolarization-related effect. On the other hand, discordant evidence is available about the effects of angiotensin II receptor type I blockers on endothelial function in patients with essential hypertension, atherosclerosis or diabetes.There are data suggesting that an increased activity of the endothelin- I system may play a role in the blunted endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of hypertensive patients, an effect that could be contrasted by the use of endothelin-I receptor antagonists. However, to date no substantial clinical efficacy of endothelin-I receptor blockers has been shown in patients with essential hypertension. Finally, other possibly useful compounds in restoring impaired endothelial function in hypertension are some antioxidant agents such as vitamin C, folic acid, the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), L-arginine and the drugs of the statin class.", 
    "81": "Statins reduce major coronary events and all-cause mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. Statin therapy has a proven track record for the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. The extension of the benefit to patients with acute coronary syndromes can be expected. Apart from their lipid-lowering effects, statins significantly and favourably alter the natural history of acute coronary syndromes. Promotion of plaque stability, improvement of endothelial dysfunction and reversal of coagulation and platelet abnormalities are only some of the effects which are beneficial in the management of these patients. Early potential clinical benefits further strengthen the rationale for starting statin treatment as soon as possible after acute coronary events particularly in patients in whom invasive intervention is planned. This review examines their role in acute coronary syndromes and emphasizes the benefits of early statin therapy.", 
    "82": "During inflammation, several cell types synthesize and secrete phospholipase A2 that catalyses lipid oxidation in LDL. Myeloperoxidase, a haeme protein secreted by activated phagocytes, oxidizes L-tyrosine to a tyrosyl radical that is a physiological catalyst for the initiation of lipid oxidation in LDL. Lipid oxidation results in the generation of aldehydes that substitute lysine residues in the apolipoprotein B-100 moiety. Lipid together with protein oxidation in LDL results in the generation of oxidized LDL. We, among others, have demonstrated an association between coronary heart disease (CHD) and increased plasma levels of oxidized LDL. Recently, we have demonstrated a higher prevalence of elevated oxidized LDL in persons with high-calculated CHD risk prior to events. The odds of having elevated oxidized LDL for persons with high-calculated CHD risk prior to events were even higher than for persons with diagnosed CHD. A likely explanation is that once CHD has been diagnosed the patients are more treated with a statin that appears to decrease oxidized LDL even beyond its cholesterol-lowering effect. We have identified several metabolic syndrome components (high triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol, glucose intolerance and diabetes) that independently of LDL-cholesterol, predicted high levels of oxidized LDL. Finally, elevated oxidized LDL predicted myocardial infarction in the Health ABC cohort consisting of well-functioning elderly people, even after adjusting for age, gender, race, smoking, and the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "83": "Cardiovascular diseases are the principal causes of mortality in middle-aged people and in older people. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases; high serum levels of cholesterol are associated with atherosclerosis and an increased risk of CHD. Cholesterol homeostasis is achieved by means of a fine balance between cholesterol intake, absorption/excretion and synthesis. All of these processes are tightly linked and a change in one of them can significantly influence the others. Results from both experimental studies and clinical trials have shown that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with a statin increases absorption and that conversely, inhibition of cholesterol absorption increases synthesis. The tight linkage of cholesterol absorption and synthesis in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis suggests that treatment with an agent that influences only one of these two processes is likely to have distinct limits with respect to its effects on cholesterol levels. Better understanding of cholesterol homeostasis, particularly the close interrelationship between cholesterol synthesis and absorption, may result in the design of rational integrated treatment regimens that employ multiple agents with complementary actions that attack multiple mechanisms to lower cholesterol.", 
    "84": "Current antiretroviral therapy protocols enable long-term survival of HIV-infected patients, decreasing the risk of infectious complications. Three classes of anti-HIV treatments are available. With longer survival, unusual cardiovascular complications related to iatrogenic biological anomalies (dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance) have appeared among this young population which is exposed to usual risk factors of atherosclerosis. Antiretroviral therapies are suspected to cause these complications, inducing maturity-onset diabetes in 4 to 20% of patients, impaired glucose tolerance in 15 to 60%, hypertriglyceridemia in 15 to 74% depending on the survey, and hypercholesterolemia in 20 to 60%, especially in case of associated lipodystrophia. A lipid battery including total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides, and 12-h fasting blood glucose should be obtained before initiating antiretroviral therapy. Any anomalous finding should be followed carefully with regular surveillance every 3 to 6 months and search for other causes of secondary dyslipidemia. In the event of casual and persisting elevation of LDL-cholesterol levels, a statin treatment can be introduced. For secondary prevention, irrespective of the context, recommendations currently merge with the consensus applying to the general population. These patients require careful surveillance of cardiovascular risk factors and a specific care in addition to treatment of their immunodeficiency.", 
    "85": "Advances in cholesterol biology suggest that cholesterol metabolism modulates beta-amyloid production, and that pharmaceuticals that inhibit cholesterol metabolism might be valuable in therapy of Alzheimer's disease. Although the genetics and cell biology continue to support the link between cholesterol and Alzheimer's disease, recent clinical studies suggest that the animal studies might not directly translate to clinical studies in humans.", 
    "86": "This review will highlight advances in genetics, cell biology and clinical sciences investigating the relationship between cholesterol and Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "87": "Cholesterol, its catabolites and proteins that regulate cholesterol levels all modulate processing of amyloid precursor protein. Statins hold promise in therapy of Alzheimer's disease, but the current data are more consistent with a model of statins that act as neuroprotective agents rather than inhibitors of beta-amyloid production.", 
    "88": "Well designed, randomized, placebo-controlled studies show that niacin prevents cardiovascular disease and death. Unfortunately, early studies and anecdotal evidence have limited its use by promoting the opinion that niacin is intolerable and contraindicated in diabetes. As evidence mounts that treating multiple lipid risk factors decreases cardiovascular risk, the use of niacin in the treatment of atherosclerosis is experiencing somewhat of a renaissance.", 
    "89": "Emerging clinical evidence shows that niacin is both safe and effective in diabetes. Niacin beneficially alters lipoprotein subclass distribution and when used in combination with statins, has additional effects on lipoproteins. Niacin selectively and directly inhibits hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, but not diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, thus inhibiting hepatic triglyceride synthesis and very low density lipoprotein secretion. The recent discovery and characterization of a membrane-bound nicotinic acid receptor (HM74) explains niacin's acute inhibition of adipocyte lipolysis, but the role of HM74 in lowering triglycerides is unclear. Niacin possesses antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and other beneficial effects on atherosclerosis unrelated to lipid lowering. Finally, niacin appears to activate nuclear transcription factors such peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma, possibly via prostaglandin metabolism.", 
    "90": "New data indicate that niacin alters lipoprotein metabolism in novel ways, and mediates other beneficial nonlipid changes that may be atheroprotective. This information forms the rationale for the use of niacin in combination with agents possessing complementary mechanisms of action (e.g. statins) for cardiovascular risk reduction beyond that observed with monotherapy. Further research into the specific mechanisms of niacin may identify additional targets for future drug development.",

    "92": "The Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) study showed that intensive statin therapy with 80 mg of atorvastatin to achieve a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 62 mg/dl resulted in a 3.9% absolute and a 16% relative risk reduction in death or major cardiovascular events up to 2 years, compared to 40 mg of pravastatin, in patients with ACS. The results were especially significant as intensive statin therapy resulted in a very early benefit (<30 days) and occurred against a background of percutaneous coronary intervention (69%) for the index admission and high use of medications for secondary prevention. The PROVE IT and the Myocardial Ischaemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) C-reactive protein sub-study also showed that atorvastatin (80 mg) resulted in a significant reduction in markers of inflammation, whilst the Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) study showed that intensive statin therapy was associated with reduced progression of atherosclerosis compared with conventional doses of statins.", 
    "93": "Intensive statin therapy results in a significant early reduction in adverse cardiac events in ACS patients which are sustained over 2 years. The early benefits seen are likely to result from modulation of inflammation, endothelial function and coagulation, i.e. the pleiotropic effects, whereas the greater reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol results in reduced long-term events.", 
    "94": "The opportunistic pathogens Rhizomucor pusillus and Rhizomucor miehei may be agents of frequently fatal mycotic diseases. In the present study, the susceptibilities of 27 clinical and environmental isolates of R. miehei and R. pusillus to lovastatin under different culturing conditions were investigated. Most of the R. miehei strains grew at lovastatin concentrations as high as 64 to 128 microg/ml. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of lovastatin on all of the R. pusillus strains was evident at lovastatin concentrations as low as 1 to 2 microg/ml. A simple and reliable method for species-level differentiation, based on the significantly higher sensitivity of R. pusillus to lovastatin than that of R. miehei, was elaborated. According this, on malt extract agar containing 6 mug of lovastatin/ml, R. pusillus is not able to produce colonies, while R. miehei will form compact colonies.", 
    "95": "Recent publications have reanimated the point of view that there exist links between atherosclerosis--inflammation and hypercholesterolemia. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible influence of statins on some inflammatory parameters in persons with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (PHC). The effects of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor--Atorvastatin--on serum lipids, apoproteins, C reactive protein (CRP), soluble Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (sICAM), lipid peroxides, antibodies to oxidized LDL (Ab oxLDL) and homocystein were evaluated in 21 persons (52.9 +/- 8.38 years old) with severe PHC, 12 of these having significant coronary-artery stenosis (diameter stenosis > or = 70%), in at least one major coronary artery branch. Ab oxLDL, sICAM, TBARS, CRP and homocystein were significantly increased (p < 0.05) in patients with coronary-artery stenosis. Following a 4 weeks hypolipemiant free baseline period, all persons were treated with Atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Atorvastatin 40 mg resulted in a reduction of LDL-C with 57.8% (baseline 259.6 +/- 71.39 mg%) p < 0.001, total Cholesterol with 44.08% (baseline 343.1 +/- 71.72 mg%) p < 0.001, Apo B with 50.6% (baseline 194.7 +/- 48.71 mg%) p < 0.001, TG with 12.02% (baseline 177.4 +/- 83.63 mg%) and HDL-C was increased with 6.84% (baseline 48.0 +/- 7.86 mg%). In coronary heart disease patients, Atorvastatin reduced homocystein concentrations with 19.41% (baseline 17.7 +/- 11.16 microM/l) (p < 0.01), and CRP with 21.9% (baseline 4.8 +/- 4.19 mg/l) p < 0.01 and TBARS with 52% (baseline 0.87 +/- 0.89 nM/ml) p < 0.001, but did not influence sICAM and Ab oxLDL. Thus atherogenic concentrations of LDL-C have to be closely modulated by minimal changes in LDL oxidative state. The effects of Atorvastatin on inflammatory parameters may crucially contribute to the clinical benefit of statins, independent of cholesterol lowering. Plaque stabilization may be a paradigm for antiinflammatory mechanism of action by this class of drugs.", 
    "96": "The statins have a moderate lowering effect upon triglycerides, one hypothesis suggesting an inhibitory effect upon liver VLDL synthesis.

Hypercholesterolaemia significantly increased the vasoconstriction response to noradrenaline (placebo versus statin treatment; p=0.046). In hypercholesterolaemia, there was a strong trend towards a reduction in the vasoconstriction response to Ang I (placebo versus statin treatment; p=0.089). In hypercholesterolaemia, the vasoconstriction response to Ang II was significantly reduced (placebo versus statin treatment; p=0.01).",

Plasma levels of apoprotein B and apoprotein E were also significantly reduced by atorvastatin 10 mg, while up-titration to 20 and 40 mg daily provided additional benefits by lowering triglycerides and apoprotein C-III. At week 12, the fraction of small dense low-density lipoprotein was significantly reduced from 23% - 18%, and apoprotein B-containing intermediate-density lipoproteins were no longer detectable.",

We measured the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, serum amyloid A (SAA), prothrombin 1.2, t-PA antigen, PAI-1, and the t-PA antigen/PAI-1 ratio. Adjusting for age, sex, race, body mass index, ABI, comorbidities, smoking, total cholesterol/HDL ratio and statin use (for CRP only), we found significant inverse linear associations between physical activity levels and log D-dimer (p = 0.002), log CRP (p < 0.001), fibrinogen (p = 0.014), and log SAA (p = 0.012). There were no significant associations between physical activity levels and other blood factors. In an analysis adjusting for all blood factors simultaneously along with known and potential confounders, log D-dimer was the only blood factor associated significantly with physical activity levels (p = 0.036).

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy and improve symptoms of heart failure by cholesterol-independent mechanisms. Statins block the isoprenylation and function of members of the Rho guanosine triphosphatase family, such as Rac1 and RhoA. Because Rac1 is a requisite component of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, which is a major source of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular cells, the ability of statins to inhibit Rac1-mediated oxidative stress contributes importantly to their inhibitory effects on cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, inhibition of RhoA by statins leads to the activation of protein kinase B/Akt and up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the endothelium and the heart. This results in increased angiogenesis and myocardial perfusion, decreased myocardial apoptosis, and improvement in endothelial and cardiac function. Because these effects of statins occur independently of cholesterol lowering, statins may have therapeutic benefits in nonhyperlipidemic patients with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.",

Although mean telomere length did not differ between statin-treated and untreated EPCs, atorvastatin (0.1 micromol/L) and mevastatin (1.0 micromol/L) both led to a more than 3-fold increase in the expression of the telomere capping protein TRF2 (telomere repeat-binding factor), as shown by immunoblotting, whereas quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction demonstrated no increase in TRF2 mRNA. Telomere dysfunction of EPCs was also paralleled by a 4-fold increase in the DNA damage checkpoint-kinase 2 (Chk2). Conversely, statin cotreatment or overexpression of TRF2 completely suppressed Chk2 induction. Finally, overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of the TRF2 protein abrogated statin-induced enhancement of migratory activity down to baseline values.",

In this paper, we have analyzed the effect of the lipid-lowering compound rosuvastatin on apoptosis and caspase-3 activity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to A beta(1-42) alone resulted in a significantly increased caspase-3 activity approximately by 35% (135+/-15%, p<0.05), and decreased alpha-secretase activity by 34% (67.4+/-2.7%, p<0.001) compared to the controls (100+/-18.1%). Rosuvastatin alone decreased caspase-3 activity by 15% (85.3+/-1.5%, p<0.0005) compared to the controls and by 50% to cells exposed to A beta alone (p<0.00005). Cells exposed to rosuvastatin alone had a higher alpha-secretase activity compared to cells exposed to A beta (76.4+/-23.8%, n.s.) but a slightly lower activity compared to the controls (n.s.). Pre-treatment of SY-SY5Y cells with rosuvastatin prior to incubation with A beta(1-42) resulted in decreased caspase-3 activity by approximately 15% compared to the controls and by approximately 48% (86.8+/-16.9%, p<0.05) compared to cells treated with A beta(1-42) alone. Also, alpha-secretase activity was increased by approximately 50% compared to the controls and by 84% (151.3+/-10.1%, p<0.05), compared to cells treated with A beta(1-42) alone. Mevalonate abrogated the effect of rosuvastatin in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the hydrophilic compound rosuvastatin decreases caspase-3 activity and increases alpha-secretase activity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells exposed to A beta in vitro.

    "146": "An increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetes mellitus type 2 has been associated with disturbances of lipid homeostasis. Recently, decreased intestinal absorption of cholesterol and increased liver cholesterol production have been reported. To investigate the influence of cholesterol lowering therapy using statin on cholesterol turnover in diabetes mellitus type 2, the levels of non-cholesterol based sterols were studied. One hundred and thirty five patients with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls with cardiovascular diseases were studied. Both groups were divided into two subgroups: treated with atorvastatin and without statin therapy. The diabetics showed significantly higher levels of lathosterol (6.97micromol l(-1) versus 5.11micromol l(-1), p = 0.012) and lower levels of sitosterol (5.03micromol l(-1) versus 8.98micromol l(-1), p < 0.001) and campesterol (6.35micromol l(-1) versus 9.80micromol l(-1), p < 0.001). Non-diabetics showed no significant differences in non-cholesterol based sterols in relation to atorvastatin therapy. A significantly lower level of lathosterol as well as a decrease in lathosterol/cholesterol ratio in the statin treated groups was found in diabetics (4.11micromol l(-1) versus 7.83micromol l(-1), p < 0.001). The results based on ANOVA analysis show that the effect of atorvastatin on the lathosterol level is more pronounced in diabetics. Regression analysis showed the relationship between increased triglycerides levels and the increase in cholesterol synthesis. The calculated regression model for loglathosterol in diabetics has the following form: log(lathosterol) = 2.76 - 0.52.statin + 0.22.cholesterol (ANOVA, p < 0.001, R(2) = 34%, p = 0.005 for statin, p < 0.001 for cholesterol). We conclude that in spite the total cholesterol level in diabetics type 2 is not increased, its endogenous synthesis is enhanced. Our results show that the diabetics type 2 with increased serum lathosterol and expressed metabolic syndrome (mild increase of triglycerides) might represent a suitable group for intensive treatment with statins.", 
    "147": "Simvastatin (10-mg tablet) has been reclassified for sale as a pharmacy-only over-the-counter medicine in the United Kingdom. It is designed to be a primary prevention agent targeting that segment of the population having a moderate risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). The anticipated effect is a reduction of risk of a first major coronary event (nonfatal myocardial infarction or CAD death). Simvastatin is a component of the Heart Health Programme, which also addresses other modifiable risk factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking. Men >/=55 years of age, men aged 45 to 54 years with >/=1 risk factor, and women aged >/=55 years with >/=1 risk factor have a moderate (10% to 15%) 10-year risk of developing CAD. Risk factors include having a first-degree relative with a history of early family CAD, smoking, being overweight, and South Asian ethnicity. Simvastatin 10 mg lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by approximately 30%, with a resultant 33% reduction in risk of a major CAD event after 3 years. After the patient completes a check-box questionnaire regarding his or her medical history and other specific risk factors, the pharmacist performs a few simple physical measurements and makes a decision as to CAD risk and simvastatin eligibility. After 1 month of simvastatin therapy, cholesterol testing is highly recommended to patients, and a kit is made available that permits home blood collection and analysis at a central laboratory.", 
    "148": "Statins have transformed the care of patients with vascular disease. Patients in almost every category that has been studied have benefited substantially. On the other hand, although the incidence of side effects is remarkably low, statins, like any other therapy, are not entirely free of serious risks. From the outset, based on the mechanism of action of statins, hepatotoxicity has been a concern. Moreover, although the mechanisms remain obscure, significant skeletal muscle injury, which can lead to renal failure and death, unquestionably does occur. To mitigate these risks, screening and monitoring programs for hepatic and skeletal muscle injury were put in place when statins were introduced into clinical practice. This article reviews the benefits and the costs of these efforts. Although the benefits have not been shown, the costs are real and substantial. These include the harm caused by inappropriate withdrawal of therapy, which has been shown to be life-saving, as well as the considerable financial expenditure. The conclusion that follows, based on the evidence in hand, is that although these programs were appropriate at the time statins were introduced, they are not appropriate now.", 
    "149": "Despite the proven benefits of statins, large numbers of patients meeting guideline criteria for therapy are not receiving these drugs. It has been suggested that over-the-counter (OTC) availability of statins would allow more consumers to use statins and achieve cardiovascular risk reduction. However, concerns have been raised as to the consumers' ability to self-manage hyperlipidemia and use statins safely. The Consumer Use Study of OTC Mevacor (CUSTOM) was designed to define consumer behaviors in the setting of OTC statin availability. The study was conducted in a simulated OTC setting and allowed consumers to purchase once-daily lovastatin 20 mg. The CUSTOM dataset includes >3,300 consumers who evaluated OTC lovastatin for potential purchase at study sites and follow-up information on purchasers for up to 6 months of self-managed therapy. These data have been analyzed to address consumers' knowledge of their cholesterol concentrations as well as their ability to make OTC use decisions based on their cardiovascular risk, avoid drug-drug interactions, self-manage their cholesterol treatment after deciding to use the OTC product, and maintain interactions with physicians while using lovastatin OTC. The results showed that most study participants appropriately self-selected OTC statin therapy and managed their treatment. Use of OTC statins by consumers needing more intensive statin therapy or facing the risk of potential drug-drug interactions remains an area of concern but occurred infrequently in CUSTOM. These data are important for making an informed risk-benefit decision concerning OTC statin availability.", 
    "150": "Surveys commissioned by the National Lipid Association (NLA) were conducted to determine the current attitudes and perceptions of physicians, consumers, and pharmacists regarding the impact of an over-the-counter (OTC) statin. Individuals from preexisting independent databases were randomly invited to participate in the online surveys that were open from January 26 to 30, 2004 for physicians and consumers and from March 1 to 12, 2004 for pharmacists. The results of these surveys indicate that consumers and pharmacists are more positive regarding the idea of an OTC statin, whereas physicians are more guarded. Concerns of both physicians and pharmacists included the discontinuation by patients of their prescription cholesterol-lowering therapy without consulting their physician, safety issues such as potential drug interactions and side effects, and patient ability to self-manage OTC statins. Consumers interested in purchasing an OTC statin reported that they would consult their physician before doing so, and pharmacists were interested in supporting consumers who use OTC statins. Although such support would require further training and time, pharmacists believed that they could facilitate consumer self-care programs and follow-up with physicians."
