A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials failed to show reduced risk of cancers in statin users. Case-control studies, however, have the advantage of examining remote exposures. This study determined the association between statins and breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, or any cancer in case-control studies. A comprehensive search for studies published through November 2006 was performed. Twenty case-control studies (100 129 incident cancer cases) were combined to obtain a pooled odds ratio using an inverse variance method. A funnel plot did not suggest a significant absence of unpublished data. The studies were significantly heterogeneous (P<0.01), thus a random effects model was used. The pooled OR and 95% confidence intervals for statin users and cancer were as follows: any cancer 0.71 (0.56-0.89), breast cancer 0.86 (0.60-1.23), colon cancer 0.89 (0.82-0.97), lung cancer 0.75 (0.50-1.11), and prostate cancer 0.74 (0.45-1.20). In this meta-analysis of case-control studies, we found a significant association between statin usage and any cancer, but when stratified by cancer type, only the association with colon cancer remained. On the basis of these results, randomized control trials with longer follow-up times than previously used are warranted.", 
    "1": "Coronary heart disease remains the major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States and other western countries despite major advances in its treatment. During the last decades, many markers of coronary artery disease have been found which help predict future risk of cardiovascular events. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein has been studied extensively and was seen to be associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes and/or peripheral artery disease. Discussed in this review is the latest literature about this marker and its association with cardiovascular disease, as well as the latest therapeutic options available.",

    "3": "To determine whether generic simvastatin tablets and capsules obtained via the Internet from international markets are equivalent to the US innovator product regarding major aspects of pharmaceutical quality.", 
    "4": "Twenty simvastatin tablets and capsules were obtained for pharmaceutical analysis: 19 generic samples from international Internet pharmacy Web sites and the US innovator product. Tablet samples were tested according to US Pharmacopeial (USP) guidelines where applicable, using high-performance liquid chromatography, disintegration, dissolution, weight variation, hardness, and assessment of physical characteristics. These tests are often used to detect formulation defects of drug products during the manufacturing process.", 
    "5": "Several international samples analyzed were not comparable to the US product in one or more aspects of quality assurance testing, and significant variability was found among foreign-made tablets themselves. Five samples failed to meet USP standards for dissolution and 2 for content uniformity. Among all samples, variability was observed in hardness, weight, and physical characterization.", 
    "6": "Results suggest that manufacturing standards for the international generic drug products compared with the US innovator product are not equivalent with regard to quality attributes. These findings have implications for safety and effectiveness that should be considered by clinicians to potentially safeguard patients who choose to purchase foreign-manufactured drugs via the Internet.", 
    "7": "Multiple intracellular signaling pathways stimulate quiescent smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to exit from G(0) and re-enter the cell cycle. Thus, a combination of two drugs with different mechanisms of action may represent a suitable approach to control SMC proliferation, a prominent feature of in-stent restenosis. In the present study, we investigated the effect of everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, in combination with fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on proliferation of rat SMCs. The antiproliferative action of everolimus was amplified by 2.5-fold by the addition of subliminal concentrations of fluvastatin (5 x 10(-7) M), lowering the IC(50) value from 2.5 x 10(-9) to 1.0 x 10(-9) M. The increased antiproliferative effect of everolimus by fluvastatin was prevented in the presence of mevalonate, farnesol, or geranylgeraniol, suggesting the involvement of prenylated proteins. Cell cycle analysis and [3H]thymidine incorporation assay demonstrated that the two drugs synergistically interfered with the progression of G(1) phase. In particular, the drug combination significantly up-regulated p27(Kip1) levels by 47.0%, suppressed cyclin E by 43.0%, and it reduced retinoblastoma (Rb) hyperphosphorylation by 79.0%, compared with everolimus alone. Retroviral overexpression of cyclin E conferred a significant resistance of rat SMCs to the antiproliferative action of the drug combination, measured by cell counting, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and cell cycle analysis, with higher levels of hyperphosphorylated form of Rb. Taken together, these results demonstrated that everolimus acts synergistically with fluvastatin to inhibit SMC proliferation by altering the expression of cyclin E and p27(kip1), which affects Rb phosphorylation and leads to G(1) phase arrest.", 
    "8": "Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and 1B3 are widely acknowledged as important and rate-limiting to the hepatic uptake of many drugs in clinical use. Accordingly, to better understand the in vivo relevance of OATP1B transporters, targeted disruption of murine Slco1b2 gene was carried out. It is noteworthy that Slco1b2(-/-) mice were fertile, developed normally, and exhibited no overt phenotypic abnormalities. We confirmed the loss of Oatp1b2 expression in liver using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western Blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Expression of Oatp1a4 and Oatp2b1 but not Oatp1a1 was greater in female Slco1b2(-/-) mice, but expression of other non-OATP transporters did not significantly differ between wild-type and Slco1b2(-/-) male mice. Total bilirubin level was elevated by 2-fold in the Slco1b2(-/-) mice despite the fact that liver enzymes ALT and AST were normal. Pharmacological characterization was carried out using two prototypical substrates of human OATP1B1 and -1B3, rifampin and pravastatin. After a single intravenous dose of rifampin (1 mg/kg), a 1.7-fold increase in plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was observed, whereas the liver-to-plasma ratio was reduced by 5-fold, and nearly 8-fold when assessed at steady-state conditions after 24 h of continuous subcutaneous infusion in Slco1b2(-/-) mice. Likewise, continuous subcutaneous infusion at low (8 microg/h) or high (32 microg/h) dose rates of pravastatin resulted in a 4-fold lower liver-plasma ratio in the in Slco1b2(-/-) mice. This is the first report of altered drug disposition profile in the Slco1b2 knockout mice and suggests the utility of this model for understanding the in vivo role of hepatic OATP transporters in drug disposition.",

Findings were similar for change in BMD at the femoral neck and trochanter.",

Nine hundred seventy-three men and women without known cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol screening levels of 115 to 190 mg/dL, had assessment of systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP, respectively). Blood pressure values were compared for placebo vs statins by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Additional analyses were performed that (1) were confined to subjects with neither high baseline BP (SBP>140 mm Hg or DBP>90 mm Hg) nor receiving BP medications, to exclude groups in whom BP medications or medication changes may have influenced results, and (2) separately evaluated simvastatin and pravastatin (vs placebo). The time course of BP changes after statin initiation and the effect of stopping statins on BP were examined.", 
    "15": "Statins modestly but significantly reduced BP relative to placebo,by 2.2 mm Hg for SBP (P=.02) and 2.4 mm Hg for DBP (P<.001) in ITT analysis. Blood pressure reductions ranged from 2.4 to 2.8 mm Hg for both SBP and DBP with both simvastatin and pravastatin, in those subjects with full follow-up, and without potential for influence by BP medications (ie, neither receiving nor meriting BP medications).",

    "17": "A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether therapy with statins significantly slows the progression of aortic valve stenosis. Altogether 226 papers were found using the reported search, of which twelve represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date, country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. The results of the reported studies provided conflicting results. There are twelve studies. Ten retrospective studies and one prospective had been promising with a slower rate of hemodynamic progression in patients taking statins. One retrospective and one randomized controlled trial did not halt the progression of calcific aortic stenosis or induce its regression. The data are discrepant as to whether this effect is related to serum lipid levels or to other effects of statins. While the data are not yet strong enough to change clinical practice, two large randomized controlled trials (ASTRONOMER and SEAS) which have recruited 272 and 1873 patients, respectively, will provide important new evidence in this area in the near future.", 
    "18": "Fluvastatin lowers lipids and protects endothelial function. This study investigated how 2 preparations of fluvastatin would affect endothelial function after treatment and early after its discontinuation. Twenty-seven patients received 80 mg extended-release fluvastatin every day, 40 mg immediate-release fluvastatin twice a day, or placebo for 5 weeks. Fasting lipids and flow-mediated dilation were measured at baseline and after each treatment period. In 21 patients, flow-mediated vasodilation was also measured 24 hours after discontinuation of therapy. Both forms of fluvastatin improved flow-mediated vasodilation (extended release: P < .037 and immediate release: P < .001). However, this improvement occurred preferentially in patients with low baseline flow-mediated vasodilation (<5%). Twenty-four hours after treatment discontinuation, the flow-mediated vasodilation deteriorated again to baseline (extended release and immediate release: P < .001). Fluvastatin improved flow-mediated vasodilation only in patients with low baseline values. Twenty-four hours after discontinuation, the flow-mediated vasodilation deteriorated again, surprisingly irrespective of prior improvement.", 
    "19": "Mice were subjected to different dietary manipulations to selectively alter expression of hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) or SREBP-2. mRNA levels for key target genes were measured and compared with the direct binding of SREBP-1 and -2 to the associated promoters using isoform specific antibodies in chromatin immunoprecipitation studies. A diet supplemented with Zetia (ezetimibe) and lovastatin increased and decreased nuclear SREBP-2 and SREBP-1, respectively, whereas a fasting/refeeding protocol dramatically altered SREBP-1 but had modest effects on SREBP-2 levels. Binding of both SREBP-1 and -2 increased on promoters for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, fatty-acid synthase, and squalene synthase in livers of Zetia/lovastatin-treated mice despite the decline in total SREBP-1 protein. In contrast, only SREBP-2 binding was increased for the low density lipoprotein receptor promoter. Decreased SREBP-1 binding during fasting and a dramatic increase upon refeeding indicates that the lipogenic \"overshoot\" for fatty-acid synthase gene expression known to occur during high carbohydrate refeeding can be attributed to a similar overshoot in SREBP-1 binding. SREBP co-regulatory protein recruitment was also increased/decreased in parallel with associated changes in SREBP binding, and there were clear distinctions for different promoters in response to the dietary manipulations. Taken together, these studies reveal that there are alternative molecular mechanisms for activating SREBP target genes in response to the different dietary challenges of Zetia/lovastatin versus fasting/refeeding. This underscores the mechanistic flexibility that has evolved at the individual gene/promoter level to maintain metabolic homeostasis in response to shifting nutritional states and environmental fluctuations.",

Although statins are regarded as generally safe, they are known to cause myopathy and, in rare cases, rhabdomyolysis. Statin-dependent effects on plasma lipids are mediated through the inhibition of HMGR in the hepatocyte, whereas evidence suggests that myotoxicity is due to inhibition of HMGR within the myocyte. Thus, an inhibitor with increased selectivity for hepatocytes could potentially result in an improved therapeutic window. Implementation of a strategy that focused on in vitro potency, compound polarity, cell selectivity, and oral absorption, followed by extensive efficacy and safety modeling in guinea pig and rat, resulted in the identification of compound 1b (BMS-644950). Using this discovery pathway, we compared 1b to other marketed statins to demonstrate its outstanding efficacy and safety profile. With the potential to generate an excellent therapeutic window, 1b was advanced into clinical development.",

Second generation cholinesterase inhibitors remain the preferred therapy for early and intermediate AD while the glutamate antagonist, memantine, is also approved for advanced stages of disease. Antioxidants may delay disease progression, while data on other experimental therapies remain equivocal at best.

Statins were recently reported to suppress acute HIV-1 infection and reduce infectious virion production, but the precise mechanism of inhibition has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that lypophilic statins suppress HIV-1 virion release from tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated latently infected U1 cells through inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation, but not by cholesterol depletion. Indeed, this suppression was reversed by the addition of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, and a geranylgeranyltransferase-1 inhibitor reduced HIV-1 production. Notably, silencing of the endogenous Rab11a GTPase expression in U1 cells by RNA interference destabilized Gag and reduced virion production both in vitro and in NOD/SCID/gammac null mice. Our findings thus suggest that small GTPase proteins play an important role in HIV-1 replication, and therefore could be attractive molecular targets for anti-HIV-1 therapy.",

At 3 months, interstitial albumin retention (AR) was markedly increased in the 3 groups. From 3 to 5 months, AR increased significantly in group U, decreased in group R and in group RM. At 5 and 8 months, AR was significantly lower in groups R and RM than in group U. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured at 8 months and was significantly lower in group R than in group U and RM. At 8 months, serum cholesterol levels were not different between the three groups whereas triglycerides were significantly lower in groups R and RM than in group U. In conclusion, in diabetic rats rosuvastatin prevents the increase in peripheral CFA and induces a decrease in blood pressure. The beneficial effect of rosuvastatin on endothelial function does not seem to result from blood pressure reduction nor lipid lowering effects.", 
    "61": "5'-AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in the regulation of cellular lipid metabolism. The contribution of vesicular exocytosis to this regulation is not known. Accordingly, we studied the effects of AMPK on exocytosis and intracellular lipid content in a model liver cell line. Activation of AMPK by metformin or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) increased the rates of constitutive exocytosis by about 2-fold. Stimulation of exocytosis by AMPK occurred within minutes, and persisted after overnight exposure to metformin or AICAR. Activation of AMPK also increased the amount of triacylglycerol (TG) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) secreted from lipid-loaded cells. These effects were accompanied by a decrease in the intracellular lipid content indicating that exocytosis of lipoproteins was involved in these lipid-lowering effects. While AMPK increased the rates of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), the lipid-lowering effects were quantitatively significant even after inhibition of FAO with R-etomoxir. These results suggest that hepatic AMPK stimulates constitutive exocytosis of lipoproteins, which may function in parallel with FAO to regulate intracellular lipid content.",

Incident cases of myopathy were identified using the following International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes: 359.x for myopathy, 728.88 for rhabdomyolysis, and 729.1 for unspecified myalgia and myositis. Prescription claims were used as a proxy for drug exposure. Five categories of exposure were employed: statins only, TZDs only, concomitant TZDs and statins, other antidiabetic agents only, and neither statins nor antidiabetic agents. Exposure to statins and/or TZDs within 90 days before the case index date was defined as recent exposure, and exposure at any time before the case index date was defined as ever exposure.

It is estimated that there are around 1 million patients in Poland after myocardial infarction (MI) requiring medical care. Implementation of optimal treatment in these patients is a significant clinical and social problem. Clinical practice guidelines published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) are focused on the crucial tasks such as regular physical activity sufficient to increase exercise capacity, smoking cessation, a Mediterranean diet, intensive control of risk factors for atherosclerosis (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), combination pharmacotherapy and in selected cases, coronary revascularization. Of particular importance is that all patients who have had an acute MI should receive optimal treatment with a combination of the drugs that are recommended as class I by the ESC guidelines. Recent registries showed that some of these drugs, including aspirin, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and statins, are commonly used in clinical practice in Poland.

A hydrophilic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) does not affect this phenomenon, but lipophilic statins further reduce the contraction during reperfusion. The effects of novel hydrophilic rosuvastatin and lipophilic pitavastatin on myocardial stunning in dogs were examined. In a preliminary experiment in vitro, pitavastatin reduced L6 cell viability at 10(-6) M and higher, whereas rosuvastatin and pravastatin up to 10(-5) M did not show such effects. An empty capsule or a capsule filled with rosuvastatin (2 mg/kg per day) or pitavastatin (0.4 mg/kg per day) was orally administered to dogs. After 3 weeks, both statins lowered the serum cholesterol level to the same extent. Under pentobarbital anesthesia, dogs were subjected to 15-min ischemia followed by 120-min reperfusion. Ischemia arrested the myocardial contraction in the ischemic area, and reperfusion recovered it but incompletely, showing the stunning phenomenon. Rosuvastatin did not modify the stunning phenomenon, while pitavastatin further deteriorated the myocardial contraction during reperfusion.",

This article compares apo J and PON1 serum concentrations, PON1 activity, and the apo J/PON1 ratio in 138 IHD patients (64 statins users and 74 statin nonusers) referred for angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention. The effect of statin treatment on apo J and PON1 concentrations, PON1 activity, and the degree of coronary artery stenosis were evaluated. In both groups, apo J levels were increased, whereas PON1 concentration and activity decreased. IHD patients on statins had significantly lower apo J concentration and higher PON1 concentration and activity. Patients on statins had less coronary artery stenosis. High apo J levels, low PON1 levels, low PON1 activity, and a high apo J/PON1 ratio were associated with IHD. Statin treatment reverses these changes, probably by multiple beneficial actions.", 
    "74": "In the present study, we examined the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity of pitavastatin, a new statin, and we compared the in vitro potencies of muscle cytotoxicity using a prototypic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD cells), a typical side effect of statins and compared the cholesterol-lowering effects of statins using Hep G2 hepatoma cells. Pitavastatin reduced the number of viable cells and caused caspase-9 and -3/7 activation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The comparison of cytotoxities of statins showed that statins significantly reduced cell viability and markedly enhanced activity of caspase-3/7 in concentration-dependent manner. On the other hand, the effects of hydrophilic statins, pravastatin, rosuvastatin were very weak. The rank order of cytotoxicity was cerivastatin > simvastatin acid> fluvastatin > atorvastatin > lovastatin acid > pitavastatin > rosuvastatin, pravastatin. Statin-induced cytotoxicity is associated with these partition coefficients. On the other hand, the cholesterol-lowering effect of statins did not correlate with these partition coefficients and cytotoxicity. Thus, it is necessary to consider the association between risk of myopathy and cholesterol-lowering effect of a statin for precise use of statins.",

It appears to exert its effect by blocking intestinal sterol transporters, specifically Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 proteins, thereby inhibiting the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, phytosterols and certain oxysterols. Ezetimibe monotherapy and in combination with statin therapy is primarily indicated for lowering LDL-cholesterol levels. In addition, it may favorably affect other parameters that could potentially further reduce atherosclerotic coronary heart disease risk, such as raising HDL-cholesterol and lowering levels of triglycerides, non-HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and remnant-like particle cholesterol. Further effects of ezetimibe include a reduction in circulating phytosterols and oxysterols and, when used in combination with statins, a reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. The clinical significance of the LDL-cholesterol lowering and other effects of ezetimibe is being evaluated in clinical outcome studies.",

It can be decreased by influencing the LDL-cholesterol values, the blood pressure and the platelet aggregation. It is, however, not proven that lowering of serum homocysteine levels reduces the risk forcardiovascular diseases. Wald and Law suggest in their epidemiological study a polypill, which has as its ingredients a statin, an anti-hypertonic drug, folic acid, and aspirine. Overall, the risk reduction by a polypill is overestimated, since a threshold is currently not existing, in all drugs side effects and interactions are possible, pharmaceuticals are only labelled for specific indications, and with missing efficacy there could be a negative risk-benefit-relation. Indeed, a combined therapy with different drugs is in place in patients with higher risk and for secondary prevention, which is already risk-adjusted. The use of effective drugs, however, in patients without evidence of a positive risk-benefit-relation and without medical control cannot be justified. Therefore, the application of the polypill for subjects beyond 55 years of age is an illusion; by contrast, treatment of patients with a high risk for atherosclerotic diseases is already reality.",

A narrative review of published randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses was conducted to critically appraise the benefits and risks of statins in primary prevention. Statins effectively reduce plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and death. The greatest benefits are observed in high-risk subjects, such as patients with diabetes or hypertension. Serious cardiovascular events should not be included among serious adverse events because they are efficacy outcomes and are dependent on the baseline risk of patients. Rates of specific serious adverse events, such as cancer and rhabdomyolysis, seem to be similar between the statin and control arms of the clinical trials examined. Thus, the benefits of statins in primary prevention outweigh the risks, particularly among high-risk patients. However, the benefit-risk ratio would likely be optimized through interventions designed to increase persistence and adherence in a real-life setting.",

In this study, we investigated the change in the cell surface area and protein content of cultured rat cardiomyocytes on exposure to cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), a cytokine involved in the growth and survival of cardiac cells, plus SIM, and thus confirmed that SIM ameliorated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by CT-1. We also showed that SIM attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in rats with pressure overload due to abdominal aortic constriction by measuring such parameters as systolic blood pressure, ratio of heart weight to body weight and ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight in rats as well as cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes. Western blot analysis indicated that the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway was involved in the mechanisms underlying the in vitro and in vivo inhibitory effects of SIM on cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, the effect of SIM amelioration on CT-1-induced cultured cardiomyocyte hypertrophy might be related to the change in angiotensinogen (AGT) mRNA expression, as evidenced by RT-PCR analysis, and the subsequent alteration in angiotensin II (Ang II) levels. The results of our study provide further evidence that SIM, like other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, is a promising drug for prevention and treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.",

The levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances induced by Fe(2+)-ascorbate in liver and heart mitochondria also increased significantly with simvastatin. Furthermore, cultured cardiac myocytes treated with simvastatin exhibited less resistance to oxidative stress, decreased time to the cessation of spontaneous beating in response to H(2)O(2) addition, and decreased responsiveness to electrical field stimulation. These results suggested that oral administration of simvastatin suppresses the biosynthesis of CoQ, which shares the same biosynthesis pathway as cholesterol up to farnesyl pyrophosphate, thus compromising the physiological function of reduced CoQ, which possesses antioxidant activity. However, these undesirable effects induced by simvastatin were alleviated by coadministering CoQ(10) with simvastatin to mice. Simvastatin also reduced the activity of NADPH-CoQ reductase, a biological enzyme that converts oxidized CoQ to the corresponding reduced CoQ, while CoQ(10) administration improved it. These findings may also support the efficacy of coadministering CoQ(10) with statins.",

We examined the effects of pravastatin and simvastatin on charge-based LDL subfractions as determined by cITP in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Patients (n=72) with CHD or CHD risk factors and elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were randomly assigned to receive pravastatin or simvastatin. After treatment with statins for 3 and 6 months, both cITP fLDL and sLDL were reduced (p<0.05) from the baseline, but the effects did not differ between treatment with pravastatin and simvastatin. At baseline and after treatment for 3 months, cITP sLDL was correlated with LDL-C, but fLDL was correlated with inflammatory markers, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and LDL-associated platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, and atherogenic lipoproteins, remnant-like particle cholesterol and small, dense LDL cholesterol.

Pretreatment by statin could reduce the occurrence of those periprocedural myonecrosis. Medline and Cochrane Database screenings allow us to select articles published until March 2007. Sixteen prospective and retrospective studies have been identified in relation with the impact of statin pretreatment on periprocedural myonecrosis or morbimortality outcomes in patients who underwent PCI. Among selected studies, 12 provide the rate of periprocedural myocardial infarction. The relative risk (RR) of periprocedural myocardial necrosis in patients pretreated with statin was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.40-0.63). Among the 5409 patients with clinical follow-up ensured until six months, the RR of death in patients pretreated with statin before the PCI was 0.64 (95% CI: 0.44-0.93). Significant heterogeneity was observed in the results. In sensitivity analysis, stable and unstable patients were compared with similar RR reduction of periprocedural myonecrosis in favour of patients receiving statin before PCI. In the present meta-analysis, we confirm that statin pretreatment before PCI is able to reduce periprocedural myonecrosis and suggest a potential impact on six months survival of patients.",

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated using the MDRD Study equation. Results indicated that patients with CKD received more diuretics (47.6% vs 32.8%; p = 0.034), calcium channel blockers (29.3% vs 23.2%, p = 0.027); and blockers of the angiotensin-renin system (76.4% vs 65.3%; p <0.001).

A lower percentage of subjects with CKD achieved good control of blood pressure (39.2% vs 65.4%; p <0.001) and glycosylated hemoglobin (43.9% vs 53.4%; p <0.001) relative to patients without CKD. Only 11.8% of patients with CKD had optimum control of all risk factors. Using multivariate analysis, the presence of CKD was inversely related to the degree of risk-factor control, especially in groups with low GFR. In conclusion, patients with stable coronary heart disease and CKD attended to in primary-care centers had poorer control of coronary heart disease risk factors than those with normal GFR despite receiving a similar rate of prescription of evidence-based cardiovascular disease preventive therapies.",

Fracture data are abstracted from the medical record. Subjects were considered to be on a statin if they were exposed at any time since the date of dialysis initiation. The subjects were 174 HD patients (68.4% male) with a median age of 69.1 and age range from 25.2 to 96.3 years. The median age at initiation of HD was 62.5, ranging from 15.2 to 90.5 years. The mean (SD) dialysis vintage was 7.3 (4.5) years. Seventy-seven subjects (44.3%) had statin exposure. There were a total of 54 first bone fractures. There was a positive correlation between bone fracture and dialysis vintage (p=0.023) and a negative association between bone fracture and statin exposure (p=0.044).

In Western countries, the yearly incidence of stroke is approximately 0.2% of the population and the number of stroke-related death is expected to double over the next 30 years. Studies from the Netherlands and Scotland showed that stroke accounted for 3% to 5% of their total health care resources. For 2006, the estimated direct and indirect cost of stroke in the United States was approximately 60 billion. Significant stenosis of the internal carotid artery is responsible for 10% to 20% of all strokes or transient ischemic attacks. Large-scale randomized clinical trials have established the superiority of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) over medical management in patients with high-grade stenosis of the internal carotid artery, particularly among symptomatic patients. Although percutaneous carotid revascularization has been performed since the early eighties, the enthusiasm has long been tempered by the fear of cerebral embolism. Following the introduction of emboli protection devices (EPD) around the year 2000, the number of procedures performed worldwide has grown exponentially. We review the available studies on carotid stenting and discuss appropriate use of this procedure. Emphasis is also placed on optimal long-term pharmacotherapy in patients with carotid stenosis.",

Data are reviewed according to trial design (observational or prospective) and baseline CVD risk. Two (ASCOT, CARDS) out of five primary CVD prevention statin trials showed a considerable reduction in stroke rates. In two (MIRACL and PROVE IT) out of five acute coronary syndrome trials, the prevention of first stroke was significant. Most secondary prevention trials (4S, CARE, LIPID, HPS, GREACE and TNT) showed a beneficial effect of statins in stroke prevention. Finally, SPARCL, the only secondary stroke prevention trial in subjects without overt coronary heart disease (CHD), showed a significant reduction in total and ischaemic (fatal and nonfatal) stroke rate, although a small but significant increase in nonfatal haemorrhagic stroke was noted. There was also a significant reduction in CHD-related events. The possible mechanisms responsible for statin-associated stroke prevention are discussed. The evidence suggests the need to consider early and long-term statin treatment (with substantial low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction) in all patients at high risk of any type of major vascular event, without discriminating CHD from stroke. Thus, statins may be beneficial to both the heart and the brain.", 
    "160": "Chronic volume/pressure overload-induced heart failure augments oxidative stress and activates matrix metalloproteinase which causes endocardial endothelial-myocyte (EM) uncoupling eventually leading to decline in myocardial systolic and diastolic function. The elevated levels of homocysteine (Hcy), hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), are associated with decline in cardiac performance. Hcy impairs the EM functions associated with the induction of ventricular hypertrophy leading to cardiac stiffness and diastolic heart failure. Hcy-induced neurological defects are mediated by the NMDA-R (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor) activation. NMDA-R is expressed in the heart. However, the role of NMDA-R on cardiac function during HHcy is still in its infancy. The blockade of NMDA-R attenuates NMDA-agonist-induced increase in the heart rate. Hcy increases intracellular calcium and activates calpain and calpain-associated mitochondrial (mt) abnormalities have been identified in HHcy. Mitochondrial permeabilization and uncoupling in the pathological setting is fueled by redox stress and calcium mishandling. Recently the role of cyclophilin D, a component of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore, has been identified in cardiac-ischemia. Mechanisms underlying the potentiation between NMDA-R activation and mitochondrial defects leading to cardiac dysfunction during HHcy remain to be elucidated. This review addresses the mitochondrial mechanism by which Hcy contributes to the decline in mechano-electrical function and arrhythmogenesis via agonizing NMDA-R. The putative role of mitochondrial MMP activation, protease stress and mitochondrial permeability transition in cardiac conduction during HHcy is discussed. The review suggests that Hcy increases calcium overload and oxidative stress in the mitochondria and amplifies the activation of mtMMP, causing the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore leading to mechano-electrical dysfunction.", 
    "161": "Previous studies suggest a reduction in cardiovascular risk among subjects expressing the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, EC 1.1.1.49) deficient phenotype. We aimed to test this hypothesis in male subjects expressing the G6PD-deficient phenotype vs wild type G6PD. In a case-control study we examined consecutive patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina, and controls admitted for diagnoses other than coronary heart disease (CHD). The G6PD phenotype was determined by measuring the enzyme activity in erythrocytes, as the absorbance rate change due to NADPH reduction. The CHD risk associated with the G6PD phenotype was assessed with unconditional logistic regression. G6PD-deficient subjects were less frequently represented among cases (11.8%) than among controls (18.6%, p=0.002). The genetic condition of G6PD deficiency conveyed a significant reduction in CHD risk (OR=0.6; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9). We confirm the hypothesis that subjects with the G6PD-deficient phenotype are less prone to CHD. We suggest that such a protective effect may be ascribable to a reduced 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA R) activity, a statin-like effect, as well as to a downregulation in NADPH oxidase activity with a consequent reduction in oxygen-free radical production.",

    "173": "We investigated the effects of chronic simvastatin treatment on the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation seen in aortas from type 2 diabetic mice. Starting at 8 weeks of diabetes, simvastatin (10 mg/kg per day) was administered to diabetic mice for 4 weeks. The significantly elevated systolic blood pressure in diabetic mice was normalized by simvastatin. Aortas from diabetic mice, but not those from simvastatin-treated diabetic mice, showed impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to both clonidine and adrenomedullin. After preincubation with an Akt inhibitor, these relaxations were not significantly different among the three Akt inhibitor-treated groups (controls, diabetics, and simvastatin-treated diabetics). Although clonidine-induced NO(x)(-) (NO(2)(-) + NO(3)(-)) production was greatly attenuated in our diabetic model, it was normalized by simvastatin treatment. The expression levels of both total Akt protein and clonidine-induced Ser-473-phosphorylated Akt were significantly decreased in diabetic aortas, while chronic simvastatin administration improved these decreased levels. The expression level of clonidine-induced phosphorylated PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) was significantly increased in diabetic aortas, but chronic simvastatin did not affect it. These results strongly suggest that simvastatin improves the endothelial dysfunction seen in type 2 diabetic mice via increases in Akt and Akt phosphorylation.", 
    "174": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm is a common condition that may be lethal when it is unrecognized. Current guidelines suggest repair as the aneurysm diameter reaches 5.0 to 5.5 cm. Most aortic aneurysms are detected incidentally when imaging is done for other purposes or through screening programs. Ninety percent of these aneurysms are below the threshold for intervention at the time of detection. A number of studies have sought to determine factors that lead to progression of aneurysmal disease that might be amenable to intervention during this period of observation. We review these studies and make recommendations for the medical management of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. On the basis of our current knowledge of the causes of aneurysm, a number of approaches have been proposed to prevent progression of aneurysmal disease. These include hemodynamic management, inhibition of inflammation, and protease inhibition. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guidelines rules of evidence have helped to define strength of evidence to support these approaches. Level A evidence (from large randomized trials) is available to indicate that observation of small aneurysms in men is safe up to a size of 5.5 cm and that propranolol does not inhibit aneurysm expansion. Level B evidence (from small randomized trials) suggests that roxithromycin or doxycycline will decrease the rate of aneurysm expansion. A number of studies agree that tobacco use is associated with an increased rate of aneurysm expansion. Level B and C evidence is available to suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may inhibit aneurysm expansion. There are animal data but no human data demonstrating that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, will decrease the rate of AAA expansion. A pharmacological agent without important side effects that inhibited aneurysm expansion could change current approaches to aneurysm treatment. Additional studies are needed to clarify the potential role of doxycycline, roxithromycin, and statin therapy in the progression of aneurysmal disease.", 
    "175": "The inflammatory response following particle inhalation is described as a key event in the development of lung diseases, e.g., fibrosis and cancer. The essential role of alveolar macrophages (AM) in the pathogenicity of particles through their functions in lung clearance and mediation of inflammation is well known. However, the molecular mechanisms and direct consequences of particle uptake are still unclear. Inhibition of different classic phagocytosis receptors by flow cytometry shows a reduction of the dose-dependent quartz particle (DQ12) uptake in the rat AM cell line NR8383. Thereby the strongest inhibitory effect was observed by blocking the FcgammaII-receptor (FcgammaII-R). Fluorescence immunocytochemistry, demonstrating FcgammaII-R clustering at particle binding sites as well as transmission electron microscopy, visualizing zippering mechanism-like morphological changes, confirmed the role of the FcgammaII-R in DQ12 phagocytosis. FcgammaII-R participation in DQ12 uptake was further strengthened by the quartz-induced activation of the Src-kinase Lyn, the phospho-tyrosine kinases Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) and PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), as shown by Western blotting. Activation of the small GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42, shown by immunoprecipitation, as well as inhibition of tyrosine kinases, GTPases, or Rac1 provided further support for the role of the FcgammaII-R. Consistent with the uptake results, FcgammaII-R activation with its specific ligand caused a similar generation of reactive oxygen species and TNF-alpha release as observed after treatment with DQ12. In conclusion, our results indicate a major role of FcgammaII-R and its downstream signaling cascade in the phagocytosis of quartz particles in AM as well as in the associated generation and release of inflammatory mediators.", 
    "176": "In this study, we determined the regulation and potential function of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGR) during skin repair in mice. Upon skin injury, healthy mice exhibited a biphasic increase in HMGR expression and activity with elevated levels at days 3 and 13 post-wounding. In situ hybridization revealed wound margin keratinocytes as a cellular source of HMGR expression. In vitro experiments using cultured HaCaT keratinocytes uncovered epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, and insulin as potent co-inducers of HMGR activity and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the cells. Insulin-, but not EGF-mediated VEGF protein expression was functionally connected to co-induced HMGR activity, as simvastatin restrictively interfered only with insulin-induced translation of VEGF mRNA by inhibition of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) phosphorylation. Functional ablation of insulin-induced sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2 by siRNA abolished HMGR expression and insulin-triggered VEGF protein release from keratinocytes. Simvastatin also blocked proliferation of cultured keratinocytes. The observed inhibitory effects of simvastatin on keratinocyte VEGF expression and proliferation could be reversed by mevalonate, the product of HMGR enzymatic activity. In accordance, simvastatin-mediated inhibition of HMGR activity in acutely regenerating tissue of wounded mice was paralleled by a marked loss of VEGF protein expression and disturbances of normal proliferation processes in wound margin keratinocytes during skin repair.",

    "178": "Sixteen untreated dyslipidaemic subjects with moderately increased cardiovascular risk (National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III) were studied before and during long-term (1 year) simvastatin treatment. Neutrophils from dyslipidaemic subjects generated more ROS in comparison with cells from healthy control subjects. After 1 year of simvastatin treatment, ROS production (delta N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-induced generation and area under the curve) was significantly reduced. At baseline, AT1-R mRNA expression was also higher in dyslipidaemic subjects than in healthy controls and it was reduced after clinical treatment with simvastatin. In a subgroup of patients, a reduced angiotensin II-induced ROS generation was also observed upon clinical simvastatin treatment. Moreover, a direct effect of statin on the upregulated AT(1)-R expression was demonstrated in vitro in neutrophils of untreated dyslipidaemic subjects.", 
    "179": "A consistent reversion of pro-inflammatory oxidative functional response and reduction of AT(1)-R expression in primed PMNs was observed in patients during long-term statin treatment. The AT1-R reduction over treatment may contribute to the normalization of dysregulated neutrophil activation which occurs in the pre-clinical phase of atherosclerosis.", 
    "180": "Statins have been shown to exert 'pleiotropic effects' independent of their cholesterol lowering actions that include anti-inflammatory properties. We show in this study that atorvastatin dependent on the way of administration may exert anti- or pro- inflammation effects. Carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and mouse air-pouch as inflammatory models were used in this study. Animals were received statins orally prior to induction of inflammation by injection of carrageenan into rat paw or the pouch. The local effect of atorvastatin was determined by injection of the drug into the pouch. Oral administration of statins reduced both the maximal edema response and neutrophils infiltration in the inflammation zone. Lovastatin had the lowest and atorvastatin had the greatest effects. Also, in the mouse air-pouch model oral treatment by atorvastatin produced a very significant (p<0.0001) reduction in carrageenan-induced pouch leukocyte recruitment and exudates production. Concurrent administration of mevalonate reversed the anti-inflammatory effect of atorvastatin. However, local injection of atorvastatin into the pouch induced a dose depend and significant increase in leukocyte recruitment into the pouch that was not reversed by co-administration of mevalonate. This study shows that atorvastatin dependent on the way of administration has both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. Contrary to anti-inflammatory effects, the pro-inflammatory responses are independent of HMG CoA reductase inhibition and can be mediated directly by atorvastatin.",

    "185": "Reducing high levels of plasmatic lipoids (LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides) is one of the most important steps in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In the majority of cases, treatment based on lifestyle changes (changes in dietary habits, more physical activity) is not sufficient and pharmacotherapy becomes necessary. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are a well tolerated first-choice drug in patients with dyslipidemia. However, great variability of statin effects has been observed in different patients on the same therapy, and the cause clearly resides in different genetic characteristics of each individual, influencing the effect of therapy. The influence of different genetic variants has been described, but the control of response to hypolipidemic therapy is most likely subject to polygenic control. The analysis of multiple gene combinations may help detect the \"hyper-\" and \"hypo-\" responders, i.e. individuals with a good response to treatment (allowing for starting with a lower dose of the drug), and those with an insufficient response to treatment (in whom statin shall not be the drug of first choice), or it may help detect the patients who are more likely to develop severe adverse events. Studies with different designs describe that for instance genes (and their variants) for cytochromes, apolipoprotein E and A1 and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase may be important genetic determinants of the effect of pharmacological treatment of dyslipidemia and play a role in the individualisation of treatment.", 
    "186": "The 'Controlled rosuvastatin multinational trial in heart failure' (CORONA) recently reported that treatment with 10 mg of rosuvastatin per day has no significant effect on primary endpoints cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke in older patients with ischaemic systolic heart failure, despite a reduction in LDL-cholesterol of 45% to a level of 2.0 mmol/l. High sensitivity C-reactive protein was also reduced by 37%. The number of hospitalizations for cardiovascular disorders was significantly reduced. There were no more side effects in the rosuvastatin group than in the placebo group, even though the population consisted of elderly people with comorbidity and at risk for adverse drug interactions due to polypharmacy. There were no signs of any pleiotropic effects of statins in patients with heart failure. There seems to be no indication to start treatment with statins in patients with moderate to severe heart failure.", 
    "187": "Our aim in this study was to investigate the changes of serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and uric acid (UA), and evaluate the synergistic effect of amlodipine and atorvastatin on blood pressure and left ventricular remodeling in hypertensive patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. One hundred and twenty-six hypertensive patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomized into amlodipine group (10 mg/day, group A, n = 65) and amlodipine (10 mg/day) plus atorvastatin group (20 mg/day, group B, n = 61), treated for 4 months continuously. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, hs-CRP, and UA were determined, and blood pressure of both groups was examined before and after treatment. Left ventricular posterior wall thickness and interventricular spectum thickness were measured by echocardiography, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was calculated. After 4-months of treatment with atorvastatin, serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, hs-CRP, and UA were significantly decreased in group B (P < 0.05, P < 0.01), while serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was elevated (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were reduced in both groups (P < 0.05), and blood pressure in group B was markedly lower than that in group A after treatment (P < 0.05). Compared with that before treatment, LVMI in both groups decreased (P < 0.05), to a significantly lower degree in group B than in group A (P < 0.05). Atorvastatin can decrease serum concentrations of hs-CRP and UA. The amlodipine-atorvastatin combination markedly reduces blood pressure and reverses left ventricular hypertrophy more than amlodipine monotherapy. The positive effect suggests that in hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic patients, the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin could be the treatment of choice.", 
    "188": "It has been suggested that the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype modifies the effect of dietary and pharmacological interventions for lowering lipid levels. We wanted to determine whether APOE genotyping information would be useful in making lipid-lowering treatment decisions in clinical practice. We included 981 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) enrolled in an inpatient 3-week standardized rehabilitation program. Of these, 555 (57%) patients received continued statin therapy and 232 (24%) patients received newly initiated statin therapy. Dietary intervention was part of the program only for 194 (20%) patients. Total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) levels decreased in all the groups of patients during rehabilitation. The decreases were less pronounced among the APOE E2 carriers. However, the observed variation among the groups with respect to reduction of lipid levels was accounted for mainly by the initial lipid levels (30-47%) and only marginally on the APOE genotype (1%) . We therefore found no evidence that APOE genotyping will be useful in guiding dietary or pharmacological lipid-lowering treatment decisions.", 
    "189": "Patients on a statin regimen have a decreased risk of death due to bacterial sepsis. We have found that protection by simvastatin includes the inhibition of host cell invasion by Staphylococcus aureus, the most common etiologic agent of sepsis. Inhibition was due in part to depletion of isoprenoid intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and led to the cytosolic accumulation of the small GTPases CDC42, Rac, and RhoB. Actin stress fiber disassembly required for host invasion was attenuated by simvastatin and by the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. PI3K relies on coupling to prenylated proteins, such as this subset of small GTPases, for access to membrane-bound phosphoinositide to mediate stress fiber disassembly. Therefore, we examined whether simvastatin restricts PI3K cellular localization. In response to simvastatin, the PI3K isoform p85, coupled to these small-GTPases, was sequestered within the cytosol. From these findings, we propose a mechanism whereby simvastatin restricts p85 localization, inhibiting the actin dynamics required for bacterial endocytosis. This approach may provide the basis for protection at the level of the host in invasive infections by S. aureus.", 
    "190": "The authors aimed to determine the incidence and angiographic features associated with plaque progression requiring nontarget lesion percutaneous coronary intervention after culprit lesion percutaneous coronary intervention. Of 945 consecutive percutaneous coronary interventions reviewed, 100 patients who required nontarget lesion percutaneous coronary intervention in the following year of the index percutaneous coronary intervention were found and compared with 100 consecutive patients who did not require nontarget lesion percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients with restenosis were excluded. Incidence of clinical plaque progression leading to additional nontarget lesion percutaneous coronary intervention in the year after an index percutaneous coronary intervention was found to be 10.5%. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, the predictors of plaque progression were multivessel disease, unstable angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, and lack of statin use. Initially, lesions that lead to repercutaneous coronary intervention were mostly nonsignificant. Clinical presentation of plaque progression was mostly acute coronary syndrome. Results emphasize the need for further study to refine the methods to identify potentially vulnerable but clinically silent plaques.", 
    "191": "Research has been carried on the feasibility of near infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy as rapid screening methods to discriminate between genuine and counterfeits of the cholesterol-lowering medicine Lipitor. Classification, based on partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models, appears to be successful for both spectroscopic techniques, irrespective of whether atorvastatine or lovastatine has been used as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The discriminative power of the NIR model, in particular, largely relies on the spectral differences of the tablet matrix. This is due to the relative large sample volume that is probed with NIR and the strong spectroscopic activity of the excipients. PLS-DA models based on NIR or Raman spectra can also be applied to distinguish between atorvastatine and lovastatine as the API used in the counterfeits tested in this study. A disadvantage of Raman microscopy for this type of analysis is that it is primarily a surface technique. As a consequence spectra of the coating and the tablet core might differ. Besides, spectra may change with the position of the laser in case the sample is inhomogeneous. However, the robustness of the PLS-DA models turned out to be sufficiently large to allow a reliable discrimination. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the spectra revealed that the conditions, at which tablets have been stored, affect the NIR data. This effect is attributed to the adsorption of water from the atmosphere after unpacking from the blister. It implies that storage conditions should be taken into account when the NIR technique is used for discriminating purposes. However, in this study both models based on NIR spectra and Raman data enabled reliable discrimination between genuine and counterfeited Lipitor tablets, regardless of their storage conditions.",
