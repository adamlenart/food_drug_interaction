We sought to determine if the Pl(A2) and ACE D polymorphisms were risk factors for recurrent coronary events. In the Cholesterol And Recurrent Events (CARE) trial, 4,159 men and women with documented myocardial infarction (MI) were randomized to receive either placebo or pravastatin, and were followed prospectively for 5 years. Pl(A) and ACE genotypes were determined in 767 patients: 385 cases who had experienced a recurrent primary event (death due to coronary disease or nonfatal MI), and 382 age- and gender-matched controls. In patients receiving placebo, the Pl(A1,A2) genotype conferred a relative risk (RR) of 1.38 (confidence intervals [CI] 1.04 to 1.83; p = 0.028; adjusted RR = 1.32, CI = 0.99 to 1.76; p = 0.058]) for the primary end point. Compared with the placebo group, pravastatin reduced the excess RR of coronary disease death and recurrent MI in the Pl(A1,A2) patient population by 31% (p = 0.06). The ACE D allele appeared to have modestly additive effects on the Pl(A1,A2) risk. Among the Pl(A1,A2) patients, pravastatin had little effect on the risk of recurrent events with the ACE II genotype, but reduced the adjusted RR from 1.42 (placebo) to 0.58 for ACE ID patients, and from 1.56 (placebo) to 0.83 for ACE DD. The Pl(A1,A2) genotype was associated with an excess of recurrent coronary events in patients after MI who did not receive pravastatin, and the ACE D allele added to this risk. These data suggest that it would be important to perform a larger study to address the potential role of these genotypes in therapeutic decision making.", 
    "1": "Magnetic resonance imaging is proving to be a very useful non-invasive imaging technique in the study of the long-term evolution of atheroma lesions. Not only is it applicable for the diagnosis of atherosclerotic disease but also for the characterization of the cellular mechanisms implied in the development of vascular damage. The four main lesions found in atherosclerosis the onset of the lesion with the appearance of remodeling, the development of vulnerable plaque, thrombus formation and the organization of the thrombus by connective tissue have been reported in detail, in both experimental animal models and in humans, from the images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging. Even though we do not yet dispose of sensitive enough methods to study the evolution of fat in coronary arteries, the high resolution images obtained in carotid or aortic plaques by magnetic resonance allow us to visualize the effect produced by statin therapy or by other protective maneuvers such as the reduction of LDL levels or the increase of HDL levels. Atherosclerotic disease must be considered as a growing tumoral process and our main goal should be to determine the degree of malignancy more than trying to quantify the stenosis. Therefore, imaging techniques constitute an essential instrument to determine the plaque characteristics, and evaluate the phase of development to thereby predict the evolution of these lesions.", 
    "2": "In primary and secondary prevention trials, statins have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke. In addition to lipid lowering, statins have a number of antiatherothrombotic and neuroprotective properties. In a preliminary observational study, we explored whether clinical outcome is improved in patients who are on treatment with statins when stroke occurs.", 
    "3": "We conducted a population-based case-referent study of 25- to 74-year-old stroke patients with, for each case of a patient who was on statin treatment at the onset of stroke (n=125), 2 referent patients who were not treated with statins but were matched for age, gender, year of onset, and stroke subtype (n=250).", 
    "4": "The unadjusted odds ratio for early discharge to home (versus late discharge or death) was 1.41 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.17) when patients on statin treatment were compared with referent stroke patients not on statins. Prognostic factors were, in general, more unfavorable among patients on statins. When this was adjusted for in a logistic regression model, the use of statins was a moderately strong but statistically nonsignificant predictor of discharge to home (multiple-adjusted odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.22).", 
    "5": "The statistical power of this case-referent study was such that only large beneficial effects of statins in acute stroke could be confirmed. However, the observed trend, together with experimental observations, is interesting enough to warrant a more detailed analysis of the relationship between statins and stroke outcome.", 
    "6": "Recent studies suggest that some of the beneficial effects of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) may be due to their cholesterol-lowering independent effects on the blood vessels. Chronic inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by oral administration of N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) to rats induces early vascular inflammation as well as subsequent arteriosclerosis. The aim of the study is to test whether treatment with statins attenuates such arteriosclerotic changes through their cholesterol-lowering independent effects. We investigated the effect of statins (pravastatin and cerivastatin) on the arteriosclerotic changes in the rat model. We found that treatment with statins did not affect serum lipid levels but markedly inhibited the L-NAME-induced vascular inflammation and arteriosclerosis. Treatment with statins augmented endothelial NO synthase activity in L-NAME-treated rats. We also found the L-NAME induced increase in Rho membrane translocation in hearts and its prevention by statins. Such vasculoprotective effects of statins were suppressed by the higher dose of L-NAME. In summary, in this study, we found that statins such as pravastatin and cerivastatin inhibited vascular inflammation and arteriosclerosis through their lipid-lowering independent actions in this model. Such antiarteriosclerotic effects may involve the increase in endothelial NO synthase activity and the inhibition of Rho activity.", 
    "7": "We investigated the inhibitory effects of fluvastain (FV) and its metabolites (M-2, M-3, M-4, M-5, and M-7) on the formation of several reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide anion (O2-), hydroxy radical (*OH), hypochlorite ion (OCL-), and linoleic acid peroxide (LOO*). Inhibitory effects of pravastatin (PV), simvastatin (SV), probucol (PR) and alpha-tocopherol (TOC) were also tested. The inhibitory effects of 5-hydroxy FV (M-2) and 6-hydroxy FV (M-3) on the formation of 1O2, O2-, *OH, and OCL- were strongest. Scavenging of 1O2 by M-4, M-5, (+)-FV, and (-)-FV was also noted. The inhibitory effects of (+)-FV on the formation of 1O2 were comparable to those of (-)-FV, PV, SV, PR and M-7 had little or no inhibitory effect on the formation of several ROS. In conclusion, FV and its metabolites, particulary M-2 and M-3, have the potential to protect against oxidative stress mediated by several ROS.", 
    "8": "Most patients fail to achieve and maintain low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals established by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP).

    "9": "Of 7542 patients screened, 3916 hypercholesterolemic patients were randomly assigned to treatment with a statin, beginning with the lowest recommended dose (atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin, 10 mg; fluvastatin and lovastatin, 20 mg). If the NCEP target was not achieved, the dose was titrated up to the recommended maximum (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and lovastatin, 80 mg; pravastatin and simvastatin, 40 mg). The total duration of treatment was 54 weeks.", 
    "10": "Atorvastatin achieved the greatest mean reduction in LDL cholesterol: 36% +/- 11% at 6 weeks (initial dose) and 42% +/- 13% at 54 weeks. More patients receiving atorvastatin at its initial dose (53%, 997 of 1888) achieved their NCEP target levels than patients receiving simvastatin (38%, 174 of 462), lovastatin (28%, 134 of 472), pravastatin (15%, 71 of 461), or fluvastatin (15%, 69 of 474) at the initial dose. Atorvastatin-treated patients were more likely to maintain their target levels from week 6 to week 54.

    "12": "Hypercholesterolaemia is an established major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in the general population. In the vast majority of studies that focused on this particular age group and carefully eliminated other confounding factors such as co-morbid conditions, hypercholesterolaemia was a risk factor for CHD in the older population. Because the prevalence of CHD increases with advancing age, studies that consider not only the relative risk attributed to cholesterol but also the absolute numbers of people affected, show hypercholesterolaemia to be an even stronger risk factor in the elderly. Large primary and secondary prevention studies of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in the elderly have shown a reduction in major coronary events similar to that observed in the younger age group. The role of hypercholesterolaemia as a risk factor for stroke is less clear, and a major limitation is the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Nevertheless, most studies that evaluated non-haemorrhagic strokes separately showed a positive association with cholesterol levels, and statin therapy is effective in preventing stroke. These data provide a rationale for treating older hypercholesterolaemic people with statins, not only to prevent CHD, but also to prevent stroke.",

Coronary vasomotor function and intimal thickness as well as coronary sinus and aortic cytokine concentrations (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-6 and soluble IL-2 receptor) were investigated.

Infarct size and cholesterol levels were similar among all groups. LV cavity area, an index of LV dilatation, was reduced in MI rats on cerivastatin compared with placebo. LV end-diastolic pressure was increased in MI rats on placebo (24.1+/-4.1 mm Hg versus sham: 5.1+/-0.3 mm Hg; P<0.01), and it was significantly reduced by cerivastatin treatment (13.7+/-2.7 mm Hg; P<0.05 versus placebo). Cerivastatin partially normalized LV dP/dt(max) and dP/dt(min), indices of LV systolic and diastolic function, which were significantly reduced in MI rats on placebo. Improvement of LV function by cerivastatin was accompanied by a reduced expression of collagen type I and beta-myosin heavy chain.

    "21": "Rosuvastatin is a new, synthetic, orally active statin, with marked low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering activity. We conducted 2 dose-ranging studies. In the first study, after a 6-week dietary run-in, 142 moderately hypercholesterolemic patients were randomized equally to receive double-blind placebo or rosuvastatin 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg or open-label atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg once daily for 6 weeks; in the second study, conducted to extend the rosuvastatin dose range, 64 patients were randomized to double-blind, once-daily placebo or rosuvastatin 40 or 80 mg (1:1:2 ratio) for 6 weeks. Data from both studies were combined for analysis of lipid effects. No statistical comparison of atorvastatin arms with placebo or rosuvastatin was performed. Rosuvastatin was associated with highly significant dose-dependent reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with placebo (p <0.001); decreases ranged from 34% (1 mg) to 65% (80 mg). Linear regression analysis indicated an additional 4.5% LDL cholesterol reduction for each doubling of the rosuvastatin dose. Across the dose range, approximately 90% of LDL cholesterol reduction occurred within the first 2 weeks of treatment. Significant, dose-dependent reductions in total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B with rosuvastatin were also observed (p <0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increases and triglyceride reductions were consistently observed and statistically significant at some dose levels. All lipid ratios were significantly reduced at all rosuvastatin dose levels (p <0.001). Adverse events were similar across placebo and active treatments. No significant increases in alanine aminotransferase or creatine kinase were seen in any patient. Over 6 weeks, rosuvastatin produced large, rapid, dose-dependent LDL cholesterol reductions and was well tolerated in hypercholesterolemic patients.", 
    "22": "An emerging body of evidence indicates that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or 'statins', provide neuroprotection in addition to reducing ischaemic stroke. Statins reduce the incidence of ischaemic stroke by stabilising atherosclerotic plaques in the precerebral vasculature and through antithrombotic actions, and the neuroprotective effects of statins may confer significant clinical benefit. Some of these neuroprotective effects are likely to be cholesterol independent and mediated by the interruption of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Therapy with statins may modulate endothelial function and preserve blood flow to regions exposed to an ischaemic insult. In particular, statin-mediated preservation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity in cerebral vasculature, especially in the ischaemic penumbra, may limit neurological deficit. Moreover, putative anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of statins may confer additional neuroprotection. Further large clinical trials are necessary to address the role of statin therapy in the primary prevention of stroke, small vessel cerebrovascular disease and vascular dementia.", 
    "23": "Six 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (the present cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins), lovastatin (L), simvastatin (S), pravastatin (P), fluvastatin (F), atorvastatin (A) and cerivastatin (C) are shown to be potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis in human hepatocytes, the target tissue for these drugs in man. All six inhibited in the nM range (IC(50) values: 0.2-8.0 nM). As daily used cholesterol-lowering drugs they are likely coadministered with other drugs. While several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved in drug metabolism in the liver and thus play an important role in drug-drug interaction it was investigated which of these enzymes are influenced by the active forms of the six statins. These enzyme activities were studied in human liver microsomal preparations, and in simian and human hepatocytes in primary culture. The following CYP reactions were used: nifedipine aromatization (CYP3A4), testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4), tolbutamide methylhydroxylation (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation (CYP2D6), aniline 4-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), coumarin 7-hydroxylation (CYP2A6) and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation (CYP1A1/2). In the human liver microsomes the statins (concentrations up to 400 microM) did not influence the CYP1A1/2 activity and hardly the CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 activities. Except P, the other five statins were stronger inhibitors of the CYP2C19 activity with IC(50) values around 200 microM and the same holds for the effect of A, C and F on the CYP2D6 activity. L and S were weaker inhibitors of the latter enzyme activity, whereas P did not influence both activities. About the same was observed for the statin effect on CYP2C9 activity, except that F was a strong inhibitor of this activity (IC(50) value: 4 microM). Using the assay of testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation the CYP3A4 activity was decreased by L, S and F with IC(50) values of about 200 microM and a little more by C and A (IC(50) around 100 microM). P had hardly an effect on this activity. To a somewhat less extent the same trend was seen when CYP3A4 activity was measured using nifedipine as substrate. The inhibitory effects observed in microsomes were verified in suspension culture of freshly isolated hepatocytes from Cynomolgus monkey (as a readily available model) and of human hepatocytes. In general the same trends were seen as in the human microsomes, except that in some cases the inhibition of the CYP activity was less, possibly by the induction of the particular CYP enzyme by incubation of the cells with a particular statin. F remained a strong inhibitor of CYP2C9 activity in human and monkey hepatocytes. A induced the CYP2C9 in monkey hepatocytes but was an inhibitor of the CYP2C9 in human hepatocytes. A, S, L and C were moderate inhibitors in both cellular systems of CYP3A4. P was not affecting any of the CYP activities in the three systems studied. It is concluded that different CYP enzymes interact with different statins and therefore differences in between these drugs are to be expected when drug-drug interaction is considered.",

Of 48 patients with biopsy-proven FSGS, 30 had pre-therapy and follow-up evaluations of proteinuria. Of these, 22 were nephrotic (> or = 3 g protein/24 h). Twelve/22 were treated with S and 10/22 with ACEI +/- HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) alone. 92% of S patients received ACEI during follow-up, 83% concurrently with steroid treatment. The two cohorts (S vs. ACEI) were not different in age (34 +/- 12 vs. 33 +/- 12), sex (75% vs. 78% male), or ethnicity (83% vs. 83% African American). Mean follow-up time was 16 (range 4 - 61 months) vs. 23 months (range 6 - 56 months). Mean S dose was 70 mg qd (range 60 - 100 mg), with mean treatment duration of 4 months. Nephrotic patients were compared with regard to degree of proteinuria at follow-up. There were no complete remissions (proteinuria < or = 200 mg/24 h) in either group. There was no difference in partial remissions (> 200 mg to < 3 g proteinuria/24 h) between the two groups - 5/12 vs. 6/10 (p = 0.434). There was no difference in the proportion of patients progressing to ESRD. Although proteinuria decreased significantly with time in both groups, there was no significant treatment effect. There was no significant time or treatment effect on serum creatinine. Mean arterial pressure and serum cholesterol were not significantly different between the groups. Thus, treatment with S +/- ACEI is no more effective in reducing proteinuria in FSGS than treatment with ACEI alone.",

    "30": "HB2 a candidate HDL receptor, is quite distinct from other HDL receptors in its structure. However, while changes in cellular cholesterol content, or a reduction in cholesterol biosynthesis accompany corresponding changes in HB2 expression, the level at which these changes occur have not been determined and the regulation and the function of HB2 remain uncertain. In order to further investigate the regulation of HB2, we administered simvastatin to rabbits to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis and follow changes in HB2 mRNA in various tissues. Six rabbits were given 15 mg/kg of simvastatin by oral administration daily and another six rabbits were given the same volume of saline as a control, for 21 days. They were then sacrificed to obtain samples of blood, liver, lung, jejunum and brain. Simvastatin reduced plasma total cholesterol by 47% and free cholesterol concentrations in liver and lung by 25 and 10%, respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that simvastatin lowered the expression of HB2 significantly in the liver and lung by 54% and 42% respectively but not in the jejunum or brain. These results support the findings of a previous study showing that HDL binding activity of both HB1 and HB2, which was determined by ligand blotting using HDL3 as a ligand, were reduced after administering cholesterol lowering agents. (Arteriosclerosis, 10: 1045-1050,1990). The present study suggests that simvastatin down-regulated HB2 at the transcriptional stage. Although the complete physiological function of HB2 is unclear, it appears to play some role in the cholesterol metabolism, warranting further studies to elucidate the nature of this interaction.",

Several clinical trials in progress will investigate the use of statins in entirely elderly or diabetic cohorts, and larger trials will continue to include significant numbers of these patients, as well as greater numbers of women. Additional clinical endpoint trials are assessing the potential benefits of lowering lipid levels to below currently recommended goals and of aggressive early statin treatment to prevent ischemic events in patients with stable coronary disease or acute coronary syndromes. These trials are expected to yield important data on the relation of lipid reduction to the prevention of coronary artery disease and on the potential for extending the use of statins.", 
    "36": "Over the past several years, results of clinical trials of lipid lowering have increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of coronary atherosclerosis and ischemia. Evidence is accumulating that cholesterol lowering has potential anti-ischemic effects and may have immediate consequences that have a favorable impact on coronary events, possibly even acute coronary syndromes. Yet, less than one half of all patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes have their cardiovascular risks appropriately modified. The results of recent statin trials provide impetus for the implementation of aggressive risk-reduction strategies in patients with coronary atherosclerosis, including those with recent acute coronary syndromes. Prevention is now a viable therapeutic goal.",

These results were achieved in a broad range of patients including those with and without a history of coronary artery disease and with elevated or average LDL-C levels. The results also support the large body of epidemiologic evidence demonstrating that the lower the cholesterol level, the lower the cardiovascular risk. Evidence now substantially supports the urgency of physicians to aggressively target the lowering of LDL-C levels for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary disease.", 
    "38": "Atherosclerotic coronary disease develops over several decades and was once thought to be an inevitable, irreversible consequence of aging. Atherogenesis is an inflammatory response that occurs after injury to the endothelium. Thrombosis, because of either endothelial erosion or plaque disruption, precipitates acute coronary events. Effective lipid lowering with statins has consistently and significantly decreased the risk that acute ischemic events will occur. The beneficial effects of statins likely result not only from their lipid-lowering effects but also from mechanisms that influence plaque behavior. Atherosclerotic plaques are not immutable; rather, their structure and composition can be altered by therapeutic modification. Ample evidence from clinical trials supports statin treatment in patients with stable coronary disease. Results of recent clinical trials support early treatment of high-risk patients with unstable coronary disease; early and aggressive statin treatment resulted in fewer recurrent ischemic events in patients with an acute coronary syndrome. Additional studies are needed to confirm the benefit of early statin treatment in patients with unstable coronary disease and to elucidate the reasons for the occurrence of events in treated patients. Research is also necessary to clarify the role of other lipids, as well as nonlipid risk factors, in the occurrence of acute ischemic events.", 
    "39": "Multifactorial risk factor modification is proven to positively influence morbidity and mortality from both cardiovascular disease and stroke. The vascular endothelium has recently been a focus of interest in cardiovascular prevention. Data suggest that vascular endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of clinical ischemia, especially angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden death. Endothelial dysfunction includes abnormalities of vasomotor tone (constriction and dilation), balance between fibrinolysis and thrombosis, control of the inflammatory response, and growth of vascular smooth muscle. Cardiovascular prevention interventions have been studied extensively and there are considerable data supporting a beneficial effect on endothelial dysfunction. The interventions that are clearly effective in improving endothelial function are diet and lipid-lowering therapy (especially with statin drugs), use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, hormone replacement therapy, vitamin E, and proper physical exercise. Many challenging issues remain unsolved, however, and the endothelium at both the molecular and cellular levels must be further investigated for both research and clinical interests.", 
    "40": "Overexpression of the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene, encoding a downstream effector of mitogenic signals that plays a central role in G1 phase progression, is often found in cancerous cells. In sporadic breast cancer (BC), this is one of the most frequent and early genetic lesions identified so far, found in more than 50% of the tumors. Inhibitors of the mevalonate/protein prenylation pathway belong to a new family of cancer therapeutic agents that act by blocking intracellular mitogenic signal transduction pathways, thereby preventing expansion of pre-cancerous foci and inhibiting growth of transformed cells. It is not known at present whether constitutively high intracellular levels of cyclin D1 might interfere with the cytostatic actions of mevalonate/protein prenylation inhibitors. This possibility was investigated here by assessing the cell cycle effects of Simvastatin, a non-toxic upstream inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, on human BC MCF-7 cells expressing either normal or enhanced levels of cyclin D1 from of a stably transfected, tet-inducible expression vector. Results show that constitutive overexpression of this protein, such as that found in sporadic BCs, does not influence the growth inhibitory effects of Simvastatin in vitro. In addition, D1-overexpressing embryo fibroblasts were also found to be responsive to the cell cycle effects of mevalonate/protein prenylation pathway blockade, further suggesting that high intracellular levels of cyclin D1 do not prevent the cytostatic actions of compounds targeting this metabolic pathway.",

Shoulder stiffness is a very common symptom, while drug-induced shoulder stiffness is generally unknown. Many cases involving such an adverse effect may thus be overlooked. We present 2 typical cases here.", 
    "42": "The treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the United States begins with the recognition of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as the primary target. An optimal LDL-C level has been defined as < 100 mg/dL. The first step in lowering LDL-C continues to be lifestyle modification, which includes a restriction of saturated fat and cholesterol, increased physical activity, and weight loss, if applicable. Approximately half of all patients with elevated LDL-C levels will ultimately need treatment with a lipid-lowering drug to achieve treatment goals. The preferred drug for first-line treatment in most patients is a statin; a bile acid resin or niacin can be used in patients who cannot tolerate statins or who are not candidates for stain therapy. Combination therapy is an option, with several combinations showing efficacy in lowering LDL-C (statin plus bile acid resin, niacin plus bile acid resin) and in lowering both LDL-C and triglycerides (statin plus fibrate, statin plus niacin, bile acid resin plus niacin). Successful lipid management includes treating to reach the LDL-C goal level, treating to reach the non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal level if applicable, and managing other risk factors for coronary heart disease.", 
    "43": "Despite advances in treatment and prevention, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States. A major risk factor for CHD is elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Randomized clinical trials have proven that lowering LDL-C to near target levels significantly reduces CHD risk. More aggressive LDL-C reductions would have an even greater impact on reducing CHD risk if these goal levels were applied to all patients at risk, as identified by a CHD risk prediction scoring system. In 1993 the second Adult Treatment Panel (ATP II) of the National Cholesterol Education Program issued guidelines that defined CHD risk on the basis of whether a patient qualified for primary or secondary prevention. The ATP III guidelines, issued May 2001, introduce the concept of CHD-equivalent risk in patients without known CHD, thereby expanding considerably the number of people eligible for lipid-lowering therapy. Unfortunately, many patients who are eligible for therapy are not receiving it, and among those on lipid-lowering therapy, less than half have achieved their treatment goals. As mentioned, findings from several large-scale primary- and secondary-prevention trials with statins and other lipid-lowering agents have shown that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk for fatal and nonfatal coronary events and results in fewer hospitalizations and revascularization procedures. In fact, a review of the 5 major statin trials reveals that the higher the patient's baseline CHD risk, the more striking the benefits of therapy are. Clearly, the need to lower LDL-C levels is crucial. Meeting this need involves targeting patients who are at risk, implementing appropriate treatment, and ensuring compliance with therapy.", 
    "44": "Lovastatin is an inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the major regulatory enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. We have previously reported that lovastatin induces a significant apoptotic response in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. To identify the critical biochemical mechanism(s) essential for lovastatin-induced apoptosis, add-back experiments were conducted to determine which downstream product(s) of the mevalonate pathway could suppress this apoptotic response. Apoptosis induced by lovastatin was abrogated by mevalonate (MVA) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and was partially inhibited by farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Other products of the mevalonate pathway including cholesterol, squalene, lanosterol, desmosterol, dolichol, dolichol phosphate, ubiquinone, and isopentenyladenine did not affect lovastatin-induced apoptosis in AML cells. Our results suggest that inhibiting geranylgeranylation of target proteins is the predominant mechanism of lovastatin-induced apoptosis in AML cells. In support of this hypothesis, the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI-298) mimicked the effect of lovastatin, whereas the farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI-277) was much less effective at triggering apoptosis in AML cells. Inhibition of geranylgeranylation was monitored and associated with the apoptotic response induced by lovastatin and GGTI-298 in the AML cells. We conclude that blockage of the mevalonate pathway, particularly inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation holds a critical role in the mechanism of lovastatin-induced apoptosis in AML cells.", 
    "45": "The isoprenoid pathway and its metabolites--digoxin, dolichol and ubiquinone were assessed in schizophrenia. There was an upregulation of the isoprenoid pathway as evidenced by elevated HMG CoA reductase activity. Digoxin, an endogenous Na+-K+ ATPase inhibitor secreted by the hypothalamus was found to be elevated and RBC membrane Na+-K+ ATPase activity was found to be reduced in schizophrenia. Membrane Na+-K+ ATPase inhibition can result in increased intracellular Ca2+ and reduced magnesium levels. Hypothalamic digoxin can modulate conscious and subliminal perception and its dysfunction may lead on to schizophrenia. Digoxin can also preferentially upregulate tryptophan transport over tyrosine resulting in increased levels of depolarising tryptophan catabolites--serotonin and quinolinic acid (NMDA agonist), and decreased levels of hyperpolarising tyrosine catabolites--dopamine and noradrenaline contributing to membrane Na+-K+ ATPase inhibition. NMDA excitotoxicity could result from hypomagnesemia induced by membrane Na+-K+ ATPase inhibition and quinolinic acid, an NMDA agonist acting on the NMDA receptor. Hypomagnesemia and increased dolichol level can affect glycoconjugate metabolism and membranogenesis leading on to disordered synaptic connectivity in the limbic allocortex and defective presentation of viral antigens and neuronal antigens contributing to autoimmunity and viral persistance important in the pathogenesis. Membrane Na+-K+ ATPase inhibition can produce immune activation, a component of autoimmunity. Mitochondrial dysfunction consequent to altered calcium/magnesium ratios and reduced ubiquinone levels can result in increased free radical generation and reduced free radical scavenging & defective apoptosis leading on to abnormal synaptogenesis. Schizophrenia can thus be considered as a syndrome of hypothalamic digoxin hypersecretion consequent to an upregulated isoprenoid pathway.",

At projected CHD risk 20% over 10 years, 12.4% (95% CI 11.4% to 13.5%) would be treated with statins.

    "50": "Cellular cholesterol homoeostasis is regulated through proteolysis of the membrane-bound precursor sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein (SREBP) that releases the mature transcription factor form, which regulates gene expression. Our aim was to identify the nature and intracellular site of the putative sterol-regulatory pool which regulates SREBP proteolysis in hamster liver. Cholesterol metabolism was modulated by feeding hamsters control chow, or a cholesterol-enriched diet, or by treatment with simvastatin or with the oral acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor C1-1011 plus cholesterol. The effects of the different treatments on SREBP activation were confirmed by determination of the mRNAs for the low-density lipoprotein receptor and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase and by measurement of HMG-CoA reductase activity. The endoplasmic reticulum was isolated from livers and separated into subfractions by centrifugation in self-generating iodixanol gradients. Immunodetectable SREBP-2 accumulated in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of cholesterol-fed animals. Cholesterol ester levels of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane (but not the cholesterol levels) increased after cholesterol feeding and fell after treatment with simvastatin or C1-1011. The results suggest that an increased cellular cholesterol load causes accumulation of SREBP-2 in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and, therefore, that membrane cholesterol ester may be one signal allowing exit of the SREBP-2/SREBP-cleavage-regulating protein complex to the Golgi.",

Improved survival by way of reduced deaths from coronary heart disease was also reported with these agents, which are primarily indicated for substantial reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels. However, the statins are extremely complex drugs and exhibit a wide variety of vascular effects that may or may not be dependent on their lipid-modifying properties. These so-called pleiotropic effects include alterations of endothelial function, inflammation, coagulation, and plaque stability. The relative contribution of the nonlipid effects of statin therapy to the well-documented clinical benefits is currently under intense investigation.", 
    "63": "The endothelium produces a number of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor substances that not only regulate vasomotor tone, but also the recruitment and activity of inflammatory cells and the propensity towards thrombosis. Endothelial vasomotor function is a convenient way to assess these other functions, and is related to the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease. Lipids (particularly low density lipoprotein cholesterol) and oxidant stress play a major role in impairing these functions, by reducing the bioavailability of nitric oxide and activating pro-inflammatory signalling pathways such as nuclear factor kappa B. Biomechanical forces on the endothelium, including low shear stress from disturbed blood flow, also activate the endothelium increasing vasomotor dysfunction and promoting inflammation by upregulating pro-atherogenic genes. In contrast, normal laminar shear stress promotes the expression of genes that may protect against atherosclerosis. The sub-cellular structure of endothelial cells includes caveolae that play an integral part in regulating the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol and oxidant stress impair caveolae structure and function and adversely affect endothelial function. Lipid-independent pathways of endothelial cell activation are increasingly recognized, and may provide new therapeutic targets. Endothelial vasoconstrictors, such as endothelin, antagonize endothelium-derived vasodilators and contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Some but not all studies have linked certain genetic polymorphisms of the nitric oxide synthase enzyme to vascular disease and impaired endothelial function. Such genetic heterogeneity may nonetheless offer new insights into the variability of endothelial function.",

The difference between the two groups approached significance at week 24 (P = 0.051). This fall was accounted for entirely by a reduction in low density lipoprotein [calculated change 1.24 mmol/l (19%) and 0.07 mmol (5.5%) in pravastatin and dietary advice groups, respectively] as high density lipoprotein rose non-significantly by 0.6 mmol/l in both groups.

Patients with this metabolic syndrome have a markedly increased risk for the development of atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease. The characteristic dyslipidemia of insulin resistance consists of elevated triglyceride and triglyceride-rich lipoprotein levels, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased concentrations of small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Management of this dyslipidemia typically involves a dual approach. Lifestyle modification is an essential component of any successful treatment plan, but alone is usually insufficient to correct these lipoprotein abnormalities. Medications that diminish insulin resistance and directly alter lipoproteins are also necessary in the majority of cases. Combinations of therapeutic agents are often required to optimize attainment of treatment goals.",

    "71": "To study the potential influence of cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) on intracellular pH regulation during apoptosis induction, we used PS120 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts devoid of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE1 isoform) transfected with constructs, allowing the expression of CFTR and/or NHE1. Kinetics of lovastatin-induced apoptosis were measured by orcein staining, double staining with Hoechst-33258, propidium iodide, DNA fragmentation, and annexin V labeling. In PS120 control cells, the percentage of apoptotic cells after 40 h of lovastatin treatment was 23 +/- 3%, whereas in PS120 CFTR-transfected cells, this percentage was 40 +/- 4%. In PS120 NHE1 cells, the transfection with CFTR did not modify the percentage of apoptotic cells after 40 h (control: 19 +/- 3%, n = 8; CFTR: 17 +/- 1%, n = 8), indicating that blocking intracellular acidification by overexpressing the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger inhibited the enhancement of apoptosis induced by CFTR. In all cell lines, the initial pH values were identical (pH = 7.46 +/- 0.04, n = 9), and treatment with lovastatin led to intracellular acidification. However, the pH value after 40 h was lower in PS120 CFTR-transfected cells (pH = 6.85 +/- 0.02, n = 10) than in PS120 cells (pH = 7.15 +/- 0.03, n = 10). To further investigate the origin of this increased intracellular acidification observed in CFTR-transfected cells, the activity of the DIDS-inhibitable Cl(-)/HCO exchanger was studied. 8-Bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate incubation resulted in Cl(-)/HCO exchanger activation in PS120 CFTR-transfected cells but had no effect on PS120 cells. Together, our results suggest that CFTR can enhance apoptosis in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, probably due to the modulation of the Cl(-)/HCO exchanger, resulting in a more efficient intracellular acidification.", 
    "72": "Optimizing coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction requires the application of clinical evidence to patient care, as well as the refinement of risk assessment. Clinical evidence indicates that most patients are not treated to optimal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals. Despite the efficacy of statin therapy in reducing the incidence of CHD, many treated patients still experience CHD events. Targeting other lipid factors such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides may augment the risk reduction achieved by lowering LDL cholesterol. Refined global risk assessment can lead to more accurate determinations of absolute risk and to the identification both of high-risk patients needing aggressive intervention and intermediate-risk patients who appear to be at low risk. Previous global risk assessment measures failed to identify a substantial proportion of primary prevention patients who would benefit from therapy. However, revised guidelines issued by the National Cholesterol Education Program introduce new criteria for more precise risk assessment and advocate use of the Framingham scoring system to calculate absolute risk. Although intensified treatment is recommended for high-risk patients, cost considerations may limit drug therapy for some lower-risk individuals.", 
    "73": "The results of five large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, involving nearly 31,000 subjects, attest to the benefits of statins in the prevention of coronary events. Several key observations can be made on the basis of the evidence from these investigations. Of primary importance is the fact that statins reduce coronary event rates in patients with or without coronary heart disease. The percentage reduction in risk increases with each successive year of statin therapy. Moreover, the risk reduction is proportional to the reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Subgroup analyses have demonstrated that the efficacy of statins extends to specific subgroups of patients, including women, people with diabetes, and older individuals. These agents also reduce the risk of stroke and transient ischemic attacks in patients with coronary disease. Both the randomized trials and widespread clinical experience have confirmed that statins are safe and do not increase the risk of cancer or mortality. Several markers of atherosclerotic risk are ameliorated by statins, although the clinical significance of this observation remains under investigation. The broad range of the therapeutic effects of statins yields safe, effective management of hypercholesterolemia in current practice while also providing a foundation for additional therapeutic refinements in the future.", 
    "74": "Statins are powerful agents for the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduction of cardiovascular risk. Newly developed statins with increased potency, such as rosuvastatin (Crestor) and NK-104 (in earlier clinical development), are capable of achieving marked LDL-C reductions. Cholesterol-lowering agents with mechanisms of action distinct from those of the statins are in active development. These include bile transport inhibitors, such as improved bile acid-absorbing resins and specific inhibitors of the ileal Na+/bile acid cotransporter. There are also specific inhibitors of cholesterol absorption, such as ezetimibe, which may provide cholesterol lowering that is additive to that achieved with statin treatment. Another approach is to reduce cardiovascular risk by modifying atherosclerotic processes within the arterial wall, as represented by the acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor avasimibe; ACAT inhibitors may reduce atherosclerotic lesions by inhibiting macrophage cholesterol storage.", 
    "75": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatments designed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in the setting of either primary or secondary prevention. The rationale for aggressive lowering of LDL-C, supported by large observational studies, is the concept that no threshold exists below which reductions fail to provide additional benefit. The statins are widely considered first-line therapy for preventing CHD events because these agents yield the greatest reductions in LDL-C. However, many patients do not achieve target LDL-C levels with the currently available statins. Newer, more effective statins may permit the benefits of aggressive LDL-C reduction to be extended to larger numbers of patients. A novel, highly efficacious statin, rosuvastatin (Crestor, AstraZeneca group of companies), is currently undergoing clinical investigation. Dose-ranging studies in hypercholesterolemic patients have shdwn that rosuvastatin produces significant, dose-dependent decreases in LDL-C when compared with placebo. Reductions have ranged from 34% at a dose of 1 mg/day to 65% at 80 mg/day. This agent has been found to be well tolerated across the range of doses studied. Phase III studies indicate that rosuvastatin is more effective than atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in improving the atherogenic lipid profiles of hypercholesterolemic patients, and more effective than atorvastatin in improving the atherogenic lipid profiles of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Overall, these findings suggest that rosuvastatin is a promising new medication for the treatment of dyslipidemias.", 
    "76": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, and effective treatment of hyperlipidaemia can prevent development of CHD and significantly reduce the risk for cardiovascular events and mortality in this disease. The advent of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) has revolutionised the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, but many patients receiving these drugs still do not achieve their therapeutic goals. Rosuvastatin (Crestor; formerly ZD4522) is a new, potent and long-lasting inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase that is highly selective for hepatocytes. Its pharmacokinetics permit once-daily dosing, and a lack of oxidative hepatic metabolism results in a reduced potential for drug-drug interactions. Preliminary clinical results indicate that it produces rapid dose-related reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B that may exceed those achieved with other currently available statins. Increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol have also been observed. Rosuvastatin is also well tolerated, with no evidence of either hepato- or myotoxicity. It is hoped that new agents such as rosuvastatin may help to reduce the high global morbidity, mortality and associated costs of CHD and related vascular disorders.", 
    "77": "The response to therapy with hypolipidemic agents shows considerable individual variation. These differences may be due to the interaction of environmental and genetic factors that affect drug bioavailability, receptor function or ligand structure. Our objective was to assess the effect of apolipoprotein (apo) E genotype and gender on lipid-lowering response to the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin. Genotyping was carried out on DNA from 328 male and female subjects who participated in a multicentric, double-blind clinical trial, and received 10 mg/day of atorvastatin. Our data demonstrate no significant gender differences for LDL cholesterol levels at baseline. Moreover, mean LDL-C lowering was similar in men (-36.2%, range -2.7 to -57.8%) and in women (-38.1%, range -9.5 to -58.5%) as compared to baseline. However, men carrying the epsilon2 allele had a significantly higher mean LDL-C response (-44%) than epsilon3 homozygotes (-37%) and epsilon4 carriers (-34%); P=0.01 for apoE group by treatment interaction. No such gene/treatment interactions were noted in women, with those carrying the epsilon2 allele showing a similar mean response (-34%) as epsilon3 homozygotes (-39%) and epsilon4 carriers (-34%). Mean plasma triglyceride lowering with atorvastatin was 17%. A significant apoE group by treatment interaction (P=0.010) was also observed in men, with epsilon2 carriers being more responsive (-27%) than epsilon3/3 (-13%) and epsilon4 (-22%). This interaction was not observed in women. In summary, atorvastatin treatment had similar effects on plasma lipid levels in both men and women; however, the apoE gene locus was a significant predictor of LDL-C and TG responses to atorvastatin therapy in men, but not in women.", 
    "78": "Statins are thought to play a role in directly affecting immune and mesenchymal cells. Since cerivastatin's pleiotropic effects are poorly investigated, we were interested to find out whether this drug can modulate leukocyte and vessel wall cell functions. Leukocyte migration was tested in modified Boyden microchemotaxis chambers and oxygen radical production was measured fluorometrically. Transendothelial migration experiments were performed with human umbilical vein endothelial cells and neutrophils. Neutrophil, monocyte, and vascular smooth muscle cell caspase-3 activity and annexin-V binding were quantified by FIENA and FACS, respectively. Cerivastatin [10 pM to 100 microM] decreased leukocyte chemotaxis towards interleukin-8 or RANTES. Migration of cells was completely restored by addition of mevalonic acid. In neutrophils, cerivastatin [100 microM] reduced transendothelial migration, whereas treatment of endothelial cells failed to affect transmigration. Neutrophil respiratory burst activity was unaffected by cerivastatin. At concentrations of 10 nM or higher, cerivastatin increased the rate of apoptosis in phagocytes and smooth muscle cells. Results show that cerivastatin is able to inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis, and that cerivastatin induces neutrophil, monocyte, and smooth muscle cell apoptosis. The drug's impact on transendothelial migration is due to its effects on neutrophils. In addition to its lipid-lowering effects, pharmacological properties of cerivastatin may include modulatory actions in leukocytes and mesenchymal cells.", 
    "79": "This study set out to clarify whether the inhibition of sterol or nonsterol derivatives arising from mevalonate biotransformation plays a major role in the in vivo anti-inflammatory action of statins. Hepatic synthesis of all these derivatives was inhibited in mice by administered statins, whereas squalestatin inhibited only sterol derivatives. Using a short-term treatment schedule, we found that statins reduced the hepatic activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase without affecting blood cholesterol. This treatment inhibited lipopolysaccharide- and carrageenan-induced pouch leukocyte recruitment and the exudate production of interleukin-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and RANTES. Coadministration of mevalonate reversed the effect of statin on leukocyte recruitment. The inhibition of sterol synthesis by squalestatin did not have any anti-inflammatory effect, indicating that the biosynthesis of nonsterol compounds arising from mevalonate is crucial for the in vivo regulation of cytokine and chemokine production by statins. Their inhibition by statins may account for the reported anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs and may provide a biochemical basis for the recently reported effects of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality.",

Because HDL can prevent LDL oxidation, the low-HDL state also may benefit clinically from supplemental antioxidants. Lipoprotein changes over 12 months were studied in 153 CAD subjects with low HDL-C randomized to take simvastatin and niacin (S-N), antioxidants (vitamins E and C, beta-carotene, and selenium), S-N plus antioxidants (S-N+A), or placebo. Mean baseline plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels of the 153 subjects were 196, 207, 127, and 32 mg/dL, respectively. Without S-N, lipid changes were minor. The S-N and S-N+A groups had comparably significant reductions (P</=0.001) in plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL-C. However, increases in HDL-C, especially HDL(2)-C, were consistently higher in the S-N group than in the S-N+A group (25% vs 18% and 42% vs 0%, respectively). With S-N, but not with S-N+A, there was a selective increase in apolipoprotein (apo) A-I (64%) in HDL particles containing apo A-I but not A-II [Lp(A-I)] and their particle size. Thus, in CAD patients with low HDL-C, S-N substantially increased HDL(2)-C, Lp(A-I), and HDL particle size. These favorable responses were blunted by the antioxidants used owing to a striking selective effect on Lp(A-I). This unexpected adverse interaction between antioxidants and lipid therapy may have important implications for the management of CAD.", 
    "81": "The objective of our study was to evaluate in humans the drug-drug interaction occurring during the concomitant administration of cisapride and simvastatin, two well-known substrates of CYP3A4.", 
    "82": "Eleven healthy men aged between 20 years and 35 years gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. Each participant received repeated doses of cisapride and/or simvastatin. At first, subjects received cisapride alone, 10 mg every 8 h, for 3 days. Then, the drug was given at the same regimen during concomitant administration of simvastatin, 20 mg every 12 h for 4 days, starting on the night of day 3. Finally, cisapride was stopped and subjects received simvastatin (20 mg every 12 h) for four additional days.", 
    "83": "Simvastatin administration caused a 14 +/- 20% increase in the AUC0-8 of cisapride. In contrast, plasma concentrations of simvastatin were unaltered by the coadministration of cisapride, whereas plasma concentrations of simvastatin acid, its active metabolite, were decreased by 33 +/- 24%.", 
    "84": "The concomitant administration of the prokinetic agent cisapride and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylgluaryl CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin resulted in altered pharmacokinetics of both drugs. Increased plasma concentrations of cisapride suggest that some patients may be at risk of toxicity while receiving both drugs, whereas the decrease in simvastatin acid plasma concentrations suggests that cholesterol lowering effects of simvastatin treatment may be blunted.", 
    "85": "Hyperlipoproteinemia is frequent following liver transplantation and may lead to atherosclerosis. Lipid-lowering agents may be useful, but could interfere with the function of the transplanted organ and with immunosuppression. We therefore evaluated in a prospective, randomized, open-labeled cross-over trial the effect of two frequently used 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (pravastatin 10 mg d(-1) and cerivastatin 0.1 mg d(-1)) in hyperlipoproteinemic patients after liver transplantation.",

Treatment periods of 6 weeks were separated by a 4-week washout period.", 
    "87": "Both medications were tolerated well, no effects on serum concentrations of liver enzymes or immunosuppressive agents were observed. Cerivastatin and pravastatin decreased (P < 0.001) cholesterol by 21 +/- 10% and 15 +/- 10%, LDL-cholesterol by 27 +/- 14% and 17 +/- 15%, respectively, while triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol concentrations did not change significantly. LDL/HDL-cholesterol markedly improved (P < 0.001) by 29 +/- 16% (cerivastatin) and 16 +/- 16% (pravastatin). Cerivastatin was more potent than pravastatin in patients receiving cyclosporine A, while there was no significant difference in patients receiving tacrolimus.", 
    "88": "Low-dose cerivastatin and pravastatin significantly improve lipid profiles following liver transplantation without affecting liver function or immunosuppression.", 
    "89": "Simvastatin is one of the competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. During clinical trials, it has shown the ability to lower serum cholesterol. We investigated the effect of simvastatin on the growth of malignant gliomas in vitro, semi-in vivo, and in vivo. An in-vitro MTT assay revealed that human malignant glioma cell lines: U-251MG, U-373MG, and U-87MG, and rat malignant glioma cell line C6 were well inhibited in growth in a dose-dependent fashion. An anchorage-independent growth assay showed that the number of colonies (more than 100 microM in size) of human (U-373MG) and rat malignant gliomas (C6) was markedly reduced in a dose-dependent fashion. A flow cytometry analysis revealed that simvastatin treatment led U-251MG cells to accumulate in sub G0-G1. Immunostaining by TUNEL method showed that most glioma cells treated by 10 microM simvastatin had nuclear immunostaining, suggesting apoptotic changes of the treated cells. The human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human lung fibroblasts were inhibited in growth by no more than 20% of controls even with a high dose (10 microM) of simvastatin. In the semi-in vivo model, using newborn rat brain slice cultures, the rhodamine-labeled glioma cells were abolished after 7 days of local simvastatin treatment with fibrin glue probably suggesting that simvastatin led the cells to apoptosis. In rat models using subcutaneously inoculated C6, the local application of simvastatin combined with fibrin glue (spray method) was quite effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor. These data suggest that simvastatin may be a novel anti-glioma drug, and the local application of simvastatin combined with fibrin glue (by spray method) may be a crucial new clinical strategy against glioma growth.",

    "95": "We examined isoprostane 8-epi-PGF2alpha, a marker of in-vivo oxidation injury, in plasma, serum and urine in these patients at baseline, when muscle problems manifested and different time intervals after withdrawing the respective statin. A healthy control group and a group of untreated patients with hyperlipoproteinemia were run as controls.", 
    "96": "The majority of patients with muscular side-effects show elevated 8-epi-PGF2alpha in plasma and urine, whereas serum values were elevated only to a lesser extent. Stopping statin therapy or successfully changing to another member of this family of compounds resulted in a normalization of the values in all patients.", 
    "97": "These findings indicate a significant involvement of oxidative injury in the muscular side-effects of statins in patients suffering from hyperlipoproteinemia.", 
    "98": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been isolated from circulating mononuclear cells in peripheral blood and shown to incorporate into foci of neovascularization, consistent with postnatal vasculogenesis. These circulating EPCs are derived from bone marrow and are mobilized endogenously in response to tissue ischemia or exogenously by cytokine stimulation. We show here, using a chemotaxis assay of bone marrow mononuclear cells in vitro and EPC culture assay of peripheral blood from simvastatin-treated animals in vivo, that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, augments the circulating population of EPCs. Direct evidence that this increased pool of circulating EPCs originates from bone marrow and may enhance neovascularization was demonstrated in simvastatin-treated mice transplanted with bone marrow from transgenic donors expressing beta-galactosidase transcriptionally regulated by the endothelial cell-specific Tie-2 promoter. The role of Akt signaling in mediating effects of statin on EPCs is suggested by the observation that simvastatin rapidly activates Akt protein kinase in EPCs, enhancing proliferative and migratory activities and cell survival. Furthermore, dominant negative Akt overexpression leads to functional blocking of EPC bioactivity. These findings establish that augmented mobilization of bone marrow-derived EPCs through stimulation of the Akt signaling pathway constitutes a novel function for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "99": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been developed as lipid-lowering drugs and are well established to reduce morbidity and mortality from coronary artery disease. Here we demonstrate that statins potently augment endothelial progenitor cell differentiation in mononuclear cells and CD34-positive hematopoietic stem cells isolated from peripheral blood. Moreover, treatment of mice with statins increased c-kit(+)/Sca-1(+)--positive hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow and further elevated the number of differentiated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Statins induce EPC differentiation via the PI 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway as demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of pharmacological PI3K blockers or overexpression of a dominant negative Akt construct. Similarly, the potent angiogenic growth factor VEGF requires Akt to augment EPC numbers, suggesting an essential role for Akt in regulating hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation. Given that statins are at least as potent as VEGF in increasing EPC differentiation, augmentation of circulating EPC might importantly contribute to the well-established beneficial effects of statins in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "100": "We investigated effects of fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and its major metabolites, M2 and M4, on CuSO4-induced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and cholesteryl ester accumulation in mouse peritoneal macrophages. All the test compounds inhibited LDL oxidation, and M2 had the most potent effect comparable to vitamin E. When LDL was previously incubated with the test compounds in the presence of CuSO4, the pre-treatment resulted in a marked reduction of facilitated cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages. Supplementation of mevalonate did not overcome the inhibitory effects of fluvastatin and its metabolites on both LDL oxidation and facilitated cholesterol esterification. Pravastatin, another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, did not show any inhibitory effect. Consequently, these effects of fluvastatin and its metabolites are considered to be derived from their own unique chemical structures. Moreover, fluvastatin and M2 directly inhibited cholesterol esterification induced by oxidized LDL in macrophages, but pravastatin was also found to have a weak effect. As their inhibitory effects were overcome by addition of mevalonate, the direct inhibitory effect on cholesterol esterification would be a common property of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The inhibitory effects of fluvastatin and its metabolites on both LDL oxidation and cholesterol esterification in macrophages may contribute to the antiatherogenic action in vivo.", 
    "101": "It was supposed that inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase (statins) might inhibit the expression of the fibrosis-related factor CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) by interfering with the isoprenylation of Rho proteins. The human renal fibroblast cell line TK173 was used as an in vitro model system to study the statin-mediated modulation of the structure of the actin cytoskeleton and of the expression of CTGF mRNA. Incubation of the cells with simvastatin or lovastatin time-dependently and reversibly changed cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton with maximal effects observed after about 18 h. Within the same time period, statins reduced the basal expression of CTGF and interfered with CTGF induction by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or transforming growth factor beta. Simvastatin and lovastatin proved to be much more potent than pravastatin (IC(50) 1 - 3 microM compared to 500 microM). The inhibition of CTGF expression was prevented when the cells were incubated with mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) but not by farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP). Specific inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferase-I by GTI-286 inhibited LPA-mediated CTGF expression whereas an inhibitor of farnesyltransferases FTI-276 was ineffective. Simvastatin reduced the binding of the small GTPase RhoA to cellular membranes. The effect was prevented by mevalonate and GGPP, but not FPP. These data are in agreement with the hypothesis that interference of statins with the expression of CTGF mRNA is primarily due to interference with the isoprenylation of RhoA, in line with previous studies, which have shown that RhoA is an essential mediator of CTGF induction. The direct interference of statins with the synthesis of CTGF, a protein functionally related to the development of fibrosis, may thus be a novel mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of statins observed in renal diseases.", 
    "102": "Lipid-lowering drugs, in particular statin treatments, have been shown to reduce the incidence of initial and recurrent coronary heart disease (CHD) events within several years of initiating therapy. This effect can be clinically detected within the first 1 to 2 years in randomized trials. Recent observational and clinical trial data suggest that lipid-lowering therapy initiated at the time of an acute coronary event can reduce recurrent events, and possibly all-cause mortality, in a much shorter period of time. The possible mechanisms by which this benefit occurs include the effect of reduced lipoprotein levels, as well as an independent effect of statins on endothelial function. Statins improve endothelial-dependent flow-mediated vasodilation by increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide. They stabilize the plaque by modulating the inflammatory response within the vessel wall. They also decrease clot formation by decreasing the adherence of platelets to the ruptured plaque and by acting on the extrinsic coagulation cascade pathway. This review examines these effects of statins and lipoproteins on vascular function, as well as the clinical evidence supporting early treatment in acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "103": "Statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids have similar actions: both enhance endothelial nitric oxide synthesis, inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, lower cholesterol levels, prevent atherosclerosis and are of benefit in coronary heart disease, stroke and osteoporosis. Statins enhance the conversion of linoleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid to their long chain derivatives. Animals with essential fatty acid deficiency show an increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity, which reverts to normalcy following topical application of linoleic acid. Similarly to statins, polyunsaturated fatty acids also inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity. In view of the similarity in their actions and as statins influence essential fatty acid metabolism, it is suggested that essential fatty acids and their metabolites may serve as second messengers of the actions of statins.", 
    "104": "Precautionary warnings for severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis from the coadministration of statins and fibrates have been well publicized. However, a recent cerivastatin labeling change made the combined use with fibric acid derivatives a contraindication.

    "106": "A comprehensive MEDLINE (1966-July 2000) and bibliographic search was performed.", 
    "107": "Thirty-six published clinical trials and 29 case reports involving combination therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives regarding the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy were reviewed. The literature review demonstrated that combination therapy with a statin and fibrate increases the risk of muscle damage, with an incidence of 0.12%. Risk factors that predispose patients to myopathy caused by combination statin-fibrate therapy include increased age, female gender, renal or liver disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, debilitated status, surgery, trauma, excessive alcohol intake, and heavy exercise.", 
    "108": "Combination therapy with a statin and fibrate offers significant therapeutic advantage for the treatment of severe or refractory mixed hyperlipidemia. Although such a combination does increase the risk of myopathy, with an incidence of approximately 0.12%, this small risk of myopathy rarely outweighs the established morbidity and mortality benefits of achieving lipid goals. Nevertheless, a higher incidence of myopathy has been reported with statin monotherapy. When monotherapy with a statin fails to control mixed hyperlipidemia, combination therapy may be considered. Niacin may be added before a fibrate is considered, as it appears to have less risk of myopathy. Statin-fibrate combination therapy must be undertaken cautiously and only after careful risk-benefit analysis. Patient counseling on the risks and warning signs of myopathy is extremely important.",

    "110": "MEDLINE searches (1966-June 2000) and manufacturer prescribing literature were employed to find articles on colesevelam. Additional studies and abstracts were identified from the bibliographies of reviewed literature.", 
    "111": "All articles identified from data sources were evaluated, and all information deemed relevant was included in this review. Priority was given to randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.", 
    "112": "Colesevelam HCl is a nonabsorbed hydrogel with bile acid sequestrant properties. Monotherapy using colesevelam in once-daily or two divided daily doses of 1.5-4.5 g has produced significant reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Mean LDL cholesterol decreases to 20% have been noted when the patient is on 3.75-4.5 g/d. Increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed (up to 9%), whereas triglycerides (TG) have increased significantly to 25% in some studies. In unpublished studies, combined use of colesevelam plus hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor have produced greater reductions in LDL cholesterol than either the statin or colesevelam administered alone. The efficacy of colesevelam monotherapy is slightly less than or similar to cholestyramine or colestipol in decreasing LDL cholesterol, although colesevelam is more potent on a gram-to-gram basis. Adverse effects have been minimal with colesevelam in published studies; this suggests an advantage over cholestyramine or colestipol therapy. Colesevelam appears to be more cost-effective than the packet dosage form of the brand formulation of the older bile acid resins. Care in selection of an appropriate agent should be exercised when considering the issues of adverse effects and palatability.", 
    "113": "Colesevelam alone or combined with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is effective in the reduction of total and LDL cholesterol. Since colesevelam is formulated as a tablet, problems with palatability such as with the powder formulation of the bile acid-binding resins are likely to be eliminated.", 
    "114": "The effect of lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxymethyl-3-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, was examined on human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC). Untransformed HVSMC were obtained from saphenous vein and in addition an SV-40 transformed immortalized cell line (HVTs-SM1) derived from saphenous vein smooth muscle was also used. HVTs-SM1 cell proliferation and DNA synthesis were measured, and cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis in both cell types was assessed by a combination of flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TUNEL) reagent-based immunocytochemistry, DAPI staining, and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. Lovastatin had no effect on apoptosis of HVSMC over 96 h in serum-free conditions or after stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), although PDGF-BB increased apoptosis in HVSMC, and this was prevented by lovastatin. In HVTs-SM1 cells lovastatin inhibited cell proliferation and DNA synthesis and induced apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The effects of lovastatin on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and apoptosis were prevented by coincubation with mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not by farnesyl pyrophosphate. Lovastatin does not induce apoptosis in saphenous vein HVSMC in culture and inhibits PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis and apoptosis. In contrast, in SV40 transformed immortalized HVTs-SM1 cells, lovastatin induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. The pro-apoptotic effects of lovastatin in SV40 transformed HVTs-SM1 cells may be related to the enhanced rate of proliferation or deregulation of the cell cycle in this cell line.",

After adjusting for age; sex; prior hospitalization; newly diagnosed cancer; or prescribed aspirin, warfarin, or estrogen, statin users (n = 77 993) had an associated decreased risk of DVT relative to those prescribed thyroid replacement therapy (n = 35 978) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.87). Compared with thyroid replacement therapy, users of nonstatin lipid-lowering agents (n = 11 891) did not seem to be at lower risk for deep vein thrombosis (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.79-1.18). In the secondary cohort of 89 508 women, after adjusting for age, prior hospitalization, newly diagnosed cancer, or prescribed aspirin or warfarin, estrogen users (n = 29 165) had an associated increased risk for DVT compared with those receiving thyroid replacement therapy (n = 22 118) (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.33), while statin users had an associated decreased risk (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.79).
