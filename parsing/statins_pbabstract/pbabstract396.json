The birds were fed with normal ('N group', n = 20) or atherogenic diet (grains + 0.4% cholesterol + 4% lard) alone ('C group', n = 20) and in association with pravastatin ('P group', n = 20). Plasma lipids and aortic intima lipidosis were studied after 3-5 and 8-12 months of the diet. Compared to the N group, pigeons from C group exhibited hypercholesterolemia (TC = 1000 mg/dl) and hyperlipoproteinemia of which level was independent of the duration of the diet. Total VLDL (VLDL+LDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein-B levels rose significantly 15, 8 and 4 times, respectively, whereas HDL were increased two times (P < 0.01) in females only. Macroscopically visible intima lipidosis areas covered 40% and 80% of aortic surface after 3-5 and 8-12 months of the diet. In P group, the increase in plasma lipid values was significantly lower than in WC from C group: -40% for total cholesterol (600 mg/dl) (P < 0.01), -71% for VLDL (P < 0.001), -53% for (VLDL+LDL)-cholesterol (P < 0.01) and -54% for apo-B (P < 0.05). HDL remained as high as in C group. Consequently TC/HDL-C ratio was improved and atherogenic risk of cholesterol was reduced by 41% (P < 0.05). Intima lipidosis areas were lowered by 35% (P < 0.01). We conclude that pravastatin treatment involves (1) a decrease in hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipoproteinemia and (2) a lowering in extensiveness and severity of macroscopically visible aortic lipidosis in cholesterol-fed White Carneau pigeon.", 
    "1": "The efficacy and safety profile of simvastatin and pravastatin across their most commonly recommended dosage ranges were compared in a double-blind, parallel, multicenter study in 550 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. The study consisted of a 6-week placebo period followed by 18 weeks of active treatment. Patients were randomized to 10 mg of simvastatin or pravastatin once in the evening; doses were titrated at 6-week intervals to a maximum of 40 mg/day if the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remained > or = 130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/liter). Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. At the end of the study with simvastatin and pravastatin, respectively, 30 and 14% continued to take the 10 mg dose and 48 and 66% were titrated to the maximal dose. After 18 weeks of treatment with simvastatin and pravastatin the mean percent decreases from baseline were, respectively, for total plasma cholesterol 27 and 19% (p < 0.01 between groups), for LDL cholesterol 38 and 26% (p < 0.01 between groups), for very low density lipoprotein cholesterol 30 and 16% (p < 0.01 between groups), and for triglycerides 18 and 14% (p < 0.05 between groups). The mean percent increase from baseline in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 15% with simvastatin compared to 12% with pravastatin (p < 0.05 between groups). The efficacy goal of LDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dl was achieved in 65% of the patients treated with simvastatin versus 39% of those treated with pravastatin (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between groups in the frequency of drug-related adverse experiences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "In the present study we investigated the subcellular localization of squalene synthase (farnesyl-diphosphate:farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.21). Squalene synthase catalyzes the formation of squalene from trans-farnesyl diphosphate in two distinct steps and is the first committed enzyme for the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Recently, a truncated form of the enzyme from rat hepatocytes was purified, and monospecific antibodies for squalene synthase were produced. This enabled the subcellular localization of squalene synthase by three different methods: (i) analytical subcellular fractionation and measurements of enzyme activities; (ii) immunodeterminations of squalene synthase in the isolated subcellular fractions with a monospecific antibody; and (iii) immunoelectron microscopy. All three methods gave consistent results. The data clearly illustrate that squalene synthase enzymatic activity and squalene synthase are exclusively localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. In rat hepatic peroxisomes we were not able to detect any squalene synthase. In addition, we also demonstrated that squalene synthase in the microsomal fraction is dramatically regulated by a number of hypolipidemic drugs and dietary treatments.", 
    "3": "In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that regulate apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB) secretion in response to the change of intracellular cholesteryl ester contents by adding low density lipoprotein (LDL) and an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (pravastatin) in rabbit hepatocyte culture system. LDL caused a significant dose-dependent increase in apoB secretion. On the other hand, the addition of pravastatin decreased apoB secretion significantly. LDL caused a dose-dependent increase in cellular cholesteryl ester, while cellular cholesteryl ester was decreased by pravastatin significantly. Therefore, these results indicate that the change of apoB secretion was in parallel with the change of cellular cholesteryl ester contents. Cellular contents of free cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid did not change. To investigate intracellular degradation of apoB prior to secretion, pulse-chase experiments were performed. It was shown that the addition of pravastatin accelerated intracellular degradation of apoB, while LDL slowed the apoB intracellular degradation rate. We also investigated whether the change of cellular cholesteryl ester could affect the apoB mRNA level. Northern blot analysis and solution hybridization RNase protection assay demonstrated that neither LDL nor pravastatin caused a significant change in cellular apoB mRNA level. We conclude that intracellular cholesteryl ester contents play a critical role in apoB secretion, and the intracellular apoB degradation rate could be the main mechanism that regulates apoB secretion in response to the change of intracellular cholesteryl ester level.", 
    "4": "Primers, based on the cDNA nucleotide sequences for rat hepatic squalene synthase (EC 2.5.1.21) (McKenzie, T.L., Jiang, G., Straubhaar, J.R., Conrad, D., and Shechter, I. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 21368-21374), were synthesized and used for the amplification and sequencing of a 1672-base pair (bp) cDNA for the human hepatic squalene synthase (HSS) from human hepatic RNA. An open reading frame of 1251 bp encoding 417 amino acids (M(r) = 48,200) was detected for HSS. We have constructed a pHSS 1286 expression vector by molecular cloning of a 1286-bp cDNA, that includes sequences of the entire coding region for HSS, into pBluescript. Expression in Escherichia coli of a functional, full-length HSS was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and enzymatic activity. Northern blot analyses of poly(A+) RNA obtained from the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 show three distinct size classes of mRNA for HSS. 1.4-, 1.6- and 2.1-kilobase mRNA were observed. The relative abundance is in the order 1.6 > 1.4 > 2.1 and did not change when the cells were grown in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol or lovastatin. The ratio between the level of HSS mRNA in cells grown in the absence and presence of 5 micrograms/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol varies between 8- and 16-fold. This lowering of the mRNA level was observed when the cells were grown in 10% of either full serum or lipid-depleted serum. A 2.7- and 4.0-fold increase of HSS mRNA was observed when HepG2 cells were grown in the presence of 5 micrograms/ml lovastatin in lipid-depleted or full serum, respectively. These studies show that HSS exhibit a relatively high level of transcriptional regulation in response to 25-hydroxycholesterol regardless of the presence of cholesterol in the growth media.",

    "7": "After 8 weeks of therapy, pravastatin in a dosage of 20 mg twice daily reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 31%, whereas a dosage of 40 mg twice daily reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 38%. Cholestyramine, 24 g daily alone, reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 32%. Cholestyramine combined with 40 mg of pravastatin reduced the level by 51%. Pravastatin, 40 or 80 mg daily, reduced the triglyceride level by 13% to 19%, resin alone increased the triglyceride level by 21%, and no change was seen with combined therapy. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased by about 5% regardless of regimen. Similar effects were seen at 24 weeks. Symptoms reported were indistinguishable among placebo and pravastatin users and were less than with cholestyramine alone or cholestyramine in combination with pravastatin. Elevations of liver enzyme levels were small in all groups, indistinguishable between resin and pravastatin, and were highest when the two drugs were combined. Plasma creatine kinase levels did not increase in any treatment group.", 
    "8": "Pravastatin treatment of hypercholesterolemia is highly effective and well tolerated alone and in combination with bile acid-binding resin and shows no tendency to increase muscle enzyme levels.", 
    "9": "The possible difference between lovastatin (mevinolin, MK-803), simvastatin (MK-733) and pravastatin (CS-514), all chemically-related competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, were tested in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2, which is often used as a model for the human hepatocyte. After an 18-hr incubation of the cells with the drugs, pravastatin (IC50 = 1900 nM) was less potent than simvastatin and lovastatin (IC50 = 34 and 24 nM, respectively) in inhibiting the sterol synthesis. As a consequence of this inhibition, the HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels and squalene synthase activity, both negatively-regulated by sterols, were increased equally by simvastatin and lovastatin, whereas the induction by pravastatin was much less. In contrast, there were fewer differences between the compounds in inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase activity, when assayed directly in Hep G2 cell homogenates (IC50 values = 18, 61 and 95 nM for simvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin, respectively). Moreover, in experiments with human hepatocytes in primary culture the IC50 values for inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis by simvastatin and pravastatin were of the same order of magnitude (23 and 105 nM, respectively). The results are therefore explained as follows: the three drugs act in the same way within the Hep G2 cell in terms of inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and their subsequent effect on the feedback regulation of the cholesterol synthesis, i.e. increasing squalene synthase and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA. However, pravastatin seems to be less able to enter the cells compared with simvastatin and lovastatin, possibly because of the higher hydrophobicity of the latter compounds. The observation with human hepatocytes suggests that in Hep G2 cells a specific hepatic transporter is missing. On one hand the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2 has proved to be a good model for the study of the feedback regulation of enzymes of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway such as HMG-CoA reductase and squalene synthase, but, on the other hand seems to be less suitable as a model for the study of specific uptake of drugs, e.g. the vastatins, in human hepatocytes.", 
    "10": "LDL-cholesterol is the leading risk factor which influences the clinical outcome of patients with preexisting coronary heart disease. Clinical trials show that plasma LDL-cholesterol below 100 mg/dL decrease the rate of recurrent myocardial infarction and can induce regression in patients with coronary heart disease. However, in most cases of severe hypercholesterolemia with plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations above 220 mg/dL LDL cannot be sufficiently decreased by maximal dietary and pharmacological therapy alone. Today this group of high risk CHD patients can be treated in addition with an extracorporeal procedure to eliminate LDL from the plasma circulation, the H.E.L.P.--LDL-apheresis. This method for selective removal of LDL, lipoprotein(a) and fibrinogen from plasma has been shown to be a clinically safe and very efficient method for the treatment of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or CHD patients with severe hypercholesterolemia. Treatments with 1 week H.E.L.P. intervals revealed a mean reduction of minus 51% for LDL, of minus 45% for Lp(a) and of minus 46% for apo B, while HDL was increased by +12%. Fibrinogen was decreased by minus 46%. Besides the marked reduction of LDL and fibrinogen plasma concentrations the H.E.L.P. treatment significantly improves hemorheological parameters and increases the oxygen tension in the tissue. We have also investigated the efficiency of a combined therapy, using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors together with the H.E.L.P.--apheresis. Under this combined treatment, a reduction of the interval LDL-cholesterol levels of 70-80% has been achieved, while Lp(a) and fibrinogen were not further affected. We now report about our long-term clinical experience with the H.E.L.P. system in treating patients with different lipoprotein disorders: (1) Homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia; (2) CHD patients with familial and non-familial hypercholesterolemia; (3) CHD patients with very high concentrations of lipoprotein(a); and (4) Hypercholesterolemic patients after heart transplantation. Based on present experience guidelines for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease indications for the H.E.L.P.--LDL-apheresis treatment are discussed.", 
    "11": "Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a rare disorder having a greater frequency in populations with founder effects for the mutations in low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. It is characterized by early signs of cholesterol infiltrates with premature coronary artery disease and does not respond to conventional lipid-lowering therapy. Plasma exchange is an established mode of treatment which improves the biochemical abnormality and may allow reversal of the physical manifestations as well as favourably influencing the clinical course of the disease. The efficacy, safety and tolerability of this procedure is confirmed by our experience over the 15 years following the previous report. In a subset of these patients who have residual LDL receptor activity, further lowering of the plasma cholesterol concentration was achieved by adding simvastatin, an hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. It is concluded that this combined approach may be of benefit in selected cases of homozygous FH undergoing regular plasmapheresis.", 
    "12": "The present study defines the origin of cholesterol subserving bile acid synthesis in male rats with an extracorporal bile duct by labeling newly formed cholesterol with tritiated water. Within 6 hr after interruption of the enterohepatic circulation, the bile acid pool was depleted. At this early time point the proportion from de novo cholesterol was 8% and 12% for biliary cholesterol and cholate, but 18% and 19% for muricholate and chenodeoxycholate, respectively. This proportion gradually rose to 40%, 34%, 51% and 51%, respectively, at 15 to 30 hr. At 78 hr after bile diversion, 64% of cholate was labeled, compared with 84% to 88% of the other biliary lipids and 71% of plasma cholesterol. Total and labeled bile acid secretion exhibited the same diurnal rhythm. To allow differentiation between direct hepatocytic de novo synthesis of bile acids from acetate and recycling of labeled plasma cholesterol, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (pravastatin) was infused from 54 to 78 hr. It suppressed total synthesis of primary bile acids by 60% to 80% but decreased the tritium label of bile acids only from a range of 74% to 92% (54 hr) to a range of 54% to 63% (78 hr), which was in the range of plasma cholesterol (58%). We conclude that bile acids and biliary cholesterol are synthesized mostly from preformed (i.e., plasma) cholesterol, both immediately after depletion of the pool in enterohepatic circulation and after derepression. Moreover, the hepatic cholesterol pools subserving the synthesis of different bile acids and biliary cholesterol secretion are not identical.", 
    "13": "Lovastatin (LOVA) is a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase widely used in clinical practice. We treated primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes, maintained in a minimal, serum-free medium on Matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane, with this drug, and found that the amounts of P450 2B2 mRNA detected on Northern blots were increased at the same doses (10(-5) to 3 x 10(-5) M) required for induction of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, a gene known to be under oxysterol regulatory control. LOVA treatment produced selective effects increasing also the mRNA levels for P450s 2C6, 2C7, 3A1, and 4A1 but not for 1A1, 2A1/2, or NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase. LOVA treatment increased the induction of 2B1/2 mRNA in cells cotreated with either phenobarbital (PB; 10(-4) M) or clotrimazole (CTZ; 10(-5) M), or of 3A1 mRNA in cells cotreated with PB (2 x 10(-3) M), but not dexamethasone (10(-5) M. LOVA treatment did not potentiate the induction of 1A1 or 4A1 mRNA in cells cotreated with beta-naphthoflavone (10(-5) M) or ciprofibrate (10(-4) M), respectively. In contrast to the potentiation of 2B1/2 mRNA induction produced by treatments with LOVA in combination with PB or CTZ, cotreatment of hepatocytes with PB and CTZ did not result in increased induction relative to that seen in cells treated with either agent alone. Treatment of hepatocyte cultures with either mevalonate (3 x 10(-4) to 3 x 10(-3) M), the immediate product of HMG-CoA reductase, or 25-hydroxycholesterol (10(-6) to 10(-5) M), a model oxysterol, resulted in dose-dependent suppression of 2B1/2 mRNA induction in cells treated with PB-like inducers. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LOVA is a unique inducer of P450 mRNA in cultured rat hepatocytes and implicate oxysterols as potential intracellular modulators of 2B1/2 induction. We conclude that endogenous metabolic factors including those related to cholesterol biosynthesis are critical in induction of liver cytochromes P450 2B1 and 2B2 by PB and \"PB-like\" agents.", 
    "14": "The relationship between lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) was studied in 58 untreated patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) from eight different kindreds, 17 spouse controls, and 17 unrelated controls. Lp(a) plasma concentrations were not significantly different between FCH subjects (343 +/- 61 mg/L, mean +/- SEM) and controls (249 +/- 52 mg/L). In FCH, log-transformed Lp(a) levels correlated positively with postheparin lipoprotein lipase ([LPL] r = .61, P = .0002) and hepatic lipase ([HL] r = .46, P = .008) activities and total plasma cholesterol level (r = .30, P = .03). In controls, Lp(a) correlated with LPL (r = .50, P = .04) and total plasma cholesterol level (r = .51, P = .003). In eight FCH patients, treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin resulted in significantly increased mean LPL activities and plasma Lp(a) concentrations. In three of these FCH patients, repeated measurements during 1 year demonstrated that changes in Lp(a) concentrations were paralleled by similar changes in LPL activity, but not HL activity. The observed correlation between postheparin plasma lipolytic activities and Lp(a) plasma concentrations suggests a connection between the metabolism of TRL and Lp(a).", 
    "15": "Growth arrest induced by serum depletion and/or treatment with mevinolin (an inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis) in the human breast cancer cell line Hs578T was overcome by exogenous mevalonate, indicating that some product or metabolite of mevalonate may be involved in the mediation of serum-regulated growth of these cells. In the search for such compounds we first tested a variety of known end products of mevalonate with respect to their ability to counteract the inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by serum-free medium and mevinolin. Thereby high doses (10 micrograms/ml) of dolichol-20 were found to cause a partial counteraction. After straight-phase HPLC purification of endogenous lipids, isolated from 3H- or 14C-mevalonate-labelled Hs578T cultures, we found that non-sterol lipids co-eluting with dolichols efficiently induced DNA synthesis. After further purification with reverse-phase HPLC it was confirmed that virtually all of this effect was achieved by compounds(s) (seen as a single UV and radioactive peak) co-eluting with dolichol-20. Nanogram doses, at most, of this (these) compound(s) elicited a substantial stimulation of DNA synthesis. The lipid(s) also counteracted the inhibition by mevinolin of N-linked glycosylation, indicating that it (they) also interfere(s) with this processing. Since treatment with tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation) abolished this growth-stimulative effect, N-linked glycosylation seems to be a necessary event in the processes leading to lipid-induced initiation of DNA synthesis.",

The effect of simvastatin on intracellular pH and Na+/H+ antiport activity was therefore studied on an adherent cell line, the SV40-virus-transformed MRC5 human fibroblast. 2. Simvastatin led to a dose-dependent decrease in intracellular pH, attributed to a reduction in Na+/H+ exchange, together with a rounding of cell shape. Mevalonate (1 mmol/l) prevented these effects of simvastatin, and when added after inhibition of the antiport by simvastatin, reversed these changes within 1-2h. 3. The phenomenon of mevalonate reversal of antiport inhibition by simvastatin was not sensitive to cycloheximide, indicating its post-translational nature. This was also consistent with the short period of incubation with mevalonate leading to reversal of antiport inhibition (1-2 h). These changes in intracellular pH regulation were not due to alterations in cell cholesterol content. 4. A variety of inhibitors of post-translational processes, such as N-linked glycosylation (tunicamycin), phosphorylation (staurosporine), isoprenylation (farnesol, limonene), and of pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-proteins or calmodulin (W7), had no effect on the reversal by mevalonate of simvastatin-induced changes in Na+/H+ antiport activity. 5. N-Ethylmaleimide (50 mumol/l for 5 min) prevented mevalonate reversing the effects of simvastatin, suggesting the importance of thiol groups in the phenomenon of reversal of the inhibition of Na+/H+ antiport activity by simvastatin. Furthermore, concurrent incubation of simvastatin-treated cells with dithiothreitol (1 mmol/l) and N-ethylmaleimide restored the ability of mevalonate to reverse the inhibitory effects of simvastatin on Na+H+ antiport activity.",

The objective of the present study was to define the role of cholesterol in the regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and determine the molecular level of its control. In order to avoid intestinal or intravenous administration of cholesterol, we manipulated the flow of cholesterol within the hepatocytes by decreasing cholesterol synthesis with lovastatin in bile fistula rats (bile acid synthesis is up-regulated), or by increasing cholesterol supply by administering mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol, to rats with intact enterohepatic circulation (bile acid synthesis is normal).

Patients were included in the study if their total cholesterol (TC) was at least 6.2 mmol/L and total triglycerides (TG) were 4.0 mmol/L or less at baseline. Half of the patients were in stratum I (TC 6.2 to 7.8 mmol/L at baseline and placebo period) and half in stratum II (TC greater than 7.8 mmol/L). The initial dose of lovastatin or simvastatin (20 and 10 mg/day, respectively) was doubled if the patient's cholesterol was greater than 5.2 mmol/L after six and/or 12 weeks, to a maximum of 80 mg/day lovastatin or 40 mg/day simvastatin.

This paper describes the aims, methodology, and baseline data. Patients with at least two coronary segments visibly involved with atherosclerosis, in whom an angiogram was carried out according to the standards required for quantitative analysis, were selected provided that the serum total cholesterol was between 5.5 and 8.0 mmol/L and fasting triglycerides were lower than 4 mmol/L. Between march 1988 and October 1989, 383 eligible patients of both sexes aged 30-67 years were randomized in 11 European clinics. Patients received either 20 mg oral simvastatin or placebo daily for 2 years in addition to dietary counseling. The primary outcome measures are the change in the mean absolute width and in the mean of the minimal width of segments analyzed quantitatively by coronary angiography performed before and after 2 and 4 years of trial medication. To this end, at least 5 coronary artery segments are analyzed in each angiogram using matched view. The 2-year analysis was completed on 89% of eligible patients in February 1992. The trial was initially designed with a 2-year treatment period. To allow for the possibility to extend this, the decision was taken to keep all patients on the original medication allocation until all 2-year angiograms had been analyzed. Based on a predefined decision rule, an independent committee then recommended extension of treatment with another 2 years, to be concluded by a third angiogram. Of the patients enrolled initially, 81% continued. Four-year follow-up will be completed late 1993 and final results are expected mid 1994.",

Although an effective hypolipidemic agent, lovastatin has been associated with rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure in patients on cyclosporin A (CsA). In this study, lovastatin was administered at 10 mg/day for 8 wk followed by 20 mg/day for 12 wk to six renal transplant recipients who were receiving CsA concomitantly. The 10-mg/day dose was effective, but an additional lipid-lowering effect was seen with the 20-mg/day dose. Both serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 27% at the end of the 20 wk of lovastatin administration. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels remained unchanged. No significant clinical or laboratory adverse effects were observed, including muscular symptoms, ophthalmologic abnormalities, or alterations in serum creatine kinase, urea nitrogen, creatinine, transaminases, and CsA levels. Peak and trough plasma concentrations of active lovastatin were comparable to those reported in normal subjects receiving a higher lovastatin dose without CsA. It was concluded that the administration of low-dose (10 to 20 mg/day) lovastatin to renal transplant recipients receiving concomitant CsA can be safe and effective in lowering serum cholesterol.",

The mean elimination t1/2 was unaffected by taking pravastatin with food. However, reductions in mean total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were identical whether pravastatin was given with or before meals. In both treatment groups, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced from baseline (p < 0.001). These results indicate that although the bioavailability of pravastatin is reduced when taken with meals, the lipid-lowering efficacy of pravastatin is not altered.

Satisfactory zero binding and sensitivity were obtained after an overnight incubation at 4 degrees C. Separation of the antibody-bound and free radiolabel was achieved by employing polyethylene glycol-goat anti-rabbit gamma-globulin (PEG-GARG) separant.

Lovastatin also elevated lipid levels in tissues, whereas azepine in general did not have a similar effect. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly elevated and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were reduced after treatment with both agents.

Pravastatin, a well tolerated HMG CoA reductase inhibitor with a convenient once-daily dosing regimen, has been shown to effectively lower total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Individual data from more than 1800 hypercholesterolemic patients enrolled in six double-blind, randomized, multicenter studies were pooled and then analyzed to compare the safety and efficacy of pravastatin in the elderly (i.e., patients at least 65 years old) and the non-elderly. In short-term studies (8-16 weeks), response was dose-related and similar in elderly and non-elderly subjects. Pravastatin 20 or 40 mg daily lowered total cholesterol 19-25%, LDL-cholesterol 25-33%, and triglycerides 14-23%; high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased 5-10%. During long-term studies, improvements were sustained for more than 24 months in both the non-elderly and elderly. The incidences of adverse drug events and laboratory abnormalities were similar in the elderly and non-elderly patients in all groups (active treatment control with resin, pravastatin alone, or combination therapy). In short-term studies, treatment was discontinued because of adverse events in < 1% of all patients treated with pravastatin (all doses) or placebo. The frequency and profile of adverse events were similar among patients treated with pravastatin or placebo. In long-term studies, treatment was discontinued in 0.4% of patients in the pravastatin group and in 0.3% of the patients in the bile-acid-binding resin group. If drug therapy is warranted, pravastatin appears to be safe and effective for long-term use in elderly patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "47": "The role of mevalonate and its products (isoprenoids) in the control of cellular proliferation was examined by investigating the effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (vastatins) on growth and on cholesterol biosynthesis of cultured arterial myocytes (SMC). Simvastatin (S) and fluvastatin (F), but not pravastatin (P), decreased the rate of growth of rat vascular SMC. The inhibition, evaluated as cell number, was dose-dependent with IC50 values of 2.8 and 2.2 microM for S and F, respectively; P (1-500 microM) was inactive. The inhibition of cell growth induced by 3.5 microM S (70% decrease) was prevented completely by the addition of 100 microM mevalonate, partially (70-85%) by the addition of 10 microM geraniol, 10 microM farnesol and 5 microM geranylgeraniol, but not by the addition of squalene, confirming the specific role of isoprenoid metabolites in regulating cell proliferation. All the tested vastatins inhibited the incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol but P had 800 times lower potency than S and F. Similar results were obtained in SMC from human femoral artery. At least 80% inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was necessary to induce a decrease in SMC proliferation. To further investigate the relationship between cholesterol synthesis and cell growth, two enantiomers of F were investigated. The enantiomer more active on HMG-CoA reductase was 70- and 1.6-fold more potent on arterial myocyte proliferation than its antipode and the racemic mixture, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "Hypercholesterolemia, before atherosclerosis, is known to reduce agonist- (e.g., acetylcholine) mediated nitric oxide (NO) production within 2 weeks of a cholesterol-enriched diet. However, no data exist on the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the basal release of NO from blood vessels. We studied the basal release of NO in rabbit coronary arteries by addition of the NO synthase blocker NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME). Basal release of NO was markedly attenuated 2 weeks after introduction of a 0.5% cholesterol addition to the diet. One week later, the adherence of neutrophils to the coronary endothelium was significantly enhanced (i.e., threefold; p < 0.01 different from control). The increased adhesiveness could be attributed to enhanced endothelial adhesion rather than to changes in the properties of the leukocytes. Both phenomena could be reversed by addition of L-arginine to isolated coronary arteries. Administration of 10 mg/day lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, markedly attenuated both the reduced basal NO production and the increased adhesiveness of the endothelium. These results support the concept that NO is an important protective agent produced by the endothelium to preserve the integrity of the endothelium and may protect it against atherogenesis.", 
    "49": "Tocotrienols are natural farnesylated analogues of tocopherols which decrease hepatic cholesterol production and reduce plasma cholesterol levels in animals. For several cultured cell types, incubation with gamma-tocotrienol inhibited the rate of [14C]acetate but not [3H] mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with 50% inhibition at approximately 2 microM and maximum approximately 80% inhibition observed within 6 h in HepG2 cells. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase total activity and protein levels assayed by Western blot were reduced concomitantly with the decrease in cholesterol synthesis. In HepG2 cells, gamma-tocotrienol suppressed reductase despite strong blockade by inhibitors at several steps in the pathway, suggesting that isoprenoid flux is not required for the regulatory effect. HMG-CoA reductase protein synthesis rate was moderately diminished (57% of control), while the degradation rate was increased 2.4-fold versus control (t1/2 declined from 3.73 to 1.59 h) as judged by [35S]methionine pulse-chase/immunoprecipitation analysis of HepG2 cells treated with 10 microM gamma-tocotrienol. Under these conditions, the decrease in reductase protein levels greatly exceeded the minor decrease in mRNA (23 versus 76% of control, respectively), and the low density lipoprotein receptor protein was augmented. In contrast, 25-hydroxycholesterol strongly cosuppressed HMG-CoA reductase protein and mRNA levels and the low density lipoprotein receptor protein. Thus, tocotrienols influence the mevalonate pathway in mammalian cells by post-transcriptional suppression of HMG-CoA reductase, and appear to specifically modulate the intracellular mechanism for controlled degradation of the reductase protein, an activity that mirrors the actions of the putative non-sterol isoprenoid regulators derived from mevalonate.", 
    "50": "NB-598, a specific inhibitor of squalene epoxidase, suppressed the secretion of cholesterol and triacylglycerol from HepG2 cells into the medium. L-654,969, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, inhibited the secretion of cholesterol as potently as NB-598, but did not suppress the secretion of triacylglycerol. Both compounds decreased the intracellular cholesterol content almost equally, and neither of the compounds reduced the intracellular triacylglycerol content. The suppression of lipid secretion by NB-598 was associated with a significant reduction in apolipoprotein (apo) B secretion into the medium. Therefore, the suppression of lipid secretion by NB-598 may be caused by a reduction in the number of triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein particles. In contrast, the suppression of cholesterol secretion by L-654,969 may be due to a modulation of lipoprotein lipid composition, since this agent did not reduce the secretion of apo B or triacylglycerol. The secretion of apo A-I was unaffected by either NB-598 or L-654,969. Pulse chase studies using [35S]methionine showed that the suppression of apo B secretion by NB-598 depended on an enhancement of intracellular degradation of apo B. These results indicate that the secretion of apo B from HepG2 cells is not regulated by the lipid synthesis alone, and suggest that the mechanism of the hypolipidemic effect of NB-598 involves the suppression of triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein secretion from the liver as well as an inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver.",

The patients were 49 males and 59 females with mean age of 55 and 59 years respectively, with a total of 157 reported suspected adverse reactions. The most important effects reported comprised muscle and vision disorders, interactions with coumarins, liver damage and psychic effects.

    "58": "Hepatic lipase (HL) is an important enzyme in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high density lipoproteins. The clinical syndrome of HL deficiency is rare and difficult to identify. We studied carriers of mutant HL to ascertain whether there are distinctive clinical and/or biochemical characteristics of the heterozygous state. In an Ontario kindred, compound heterozygosity for two HL mutations, S267F and T383M, underlies the clinical syndrome of complete HL deficiency. We report that simple heterozygotes for either HL mutant do not have a discrete lipoprotein abnormality, except for relative triglyceride enrichment of lipoprotein fractions with d > 1.006 g/mL. Postheparin HL activity is depressed to a greater degree in carriers of S267F compared with carriers of T383M. Retinyl palmitate loading studies in a compound heterozygote revealed impaired clearance of chylomicron remnants. The dyslipoproteinemia in a compound heterozygote was ameliorated by lovastatin. There was no difference in the quantity and distribution of HL mRNA in the liver of a compound heterozygote when compared with that of a normal subject. Thus, HL deficiency associated with structural variation of the HL gene is characterized by premature atherosclerosis, triglyceride enrichment of lipoprotein fractions with d > 1.006 g/mL, the presence of circulating beta-very low density lipoproteins, and abnormal catabolism of postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.", 
    "59": "Blockade of mevalonate synthesis by the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase inhibitor mevinolin (lovastatin) causes FRTL-5 thyroid cells to undergo significant morphological changes; these include a transition from a flat, polygonal to a round shape, the development of cytoplasmic arborizations, and the loss of contact between neighboring cells. Immunofluorescence studies of cytoskeletal structures show that, at early times after administering the drug, and before the round phenotype develops, stress fibers disassemble while the peripheral actin filaments, which are adjacent to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, appear largely unaffected. Subsequently, when this cortical actin network becomes fragmented, cells start to round up and become separated from neighbors. Microtubules become disconnected from the plasma membrane and retract toward the cell center, although they do not appear depolymerized; indeed, at this stage, cytoplasmic elongations contain mostly intact microtubules. After exposure to mevinolin FRTL-5 cells also lose vinculin-related substrate contacts. Treatment of cells with either cycloheximide or colchicine abolishes morphological changes induced by mevinolin, suggesting that ongoing protein synthesis and microtubule integrity are prerequisites for the drug to be effective. Both cytoskeletal and morphological perturbations can be reversed by mevalonate, but not by cholesterol or the non-sterol derivatives of mevalonate such as dolichol, ubiquinone, and isopentenyladenine, individually or in combination. It is suggested that mevalonate deficiency may impair formation of isoprenylated proteins important for cytoskeletal organization and stability.", 
    "60": "The host response to infection is frequently accompanied by changes in cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) metabolism. To determine the role of cytokines in mediating these changes, we studied the effects of endotoxin (LPS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) on cholesterol and TG metabolism in C57Bl/6 (LPS-sensitive) mice and in C3H/HeJ (LPS-resistant) mice whose macrophages do not produce TNF and IL-1 in response to LPS. Sixteen hours after administration, LPS (1 micrograms/mouse) produced a 41% increase in serum cholesterol and a 62% increase in serum TG levels in C57Bl/6 mice whereas a 100-fold higher dose of LPS did not have a significant effect in C3H/HeJ mice. LPS (1 microgram/mouse) also produced a 8.6-fold increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis and a 2.7-fold increase in hepatic fatty acid synthesis in C57Bl/6 mice but had no effect in C3H/HeJ mice. This suggests that macrophage produced cytokines such as TNF and IL-1 may be involved in mediating these effects of LPS. Additionally, LPS also increased the activity of hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. As seen with LPS, TNF and IL-1 also increased serum cholesterol and TG levels in C57Bl/6 mice. Moreover, TNF and IL-1 produced a 2.3- and 2.1-fold increase in hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity, respectively. Finally, pretreatment of mice with anti-TNF antibodies, but not with an IL-1 receptor antagonist, blocked the effect of LPS on serum cholesterol and TG levels, hepatic cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, and hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity. These results suggest that whereas both TNF and IL-1 mimic the effects of LPS on cholesterol and TG metabolism, TNF may be the in vivo mediator of these late effects of LPS in mice.", 
    "61": "Following three 24 hourly serial injections of 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (4-APP) to rats, the levels of plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and of adrenal HMG-CoA reductase, the cholesterol side chain cleavage system, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 21-hydroxylase, and adrenodoxin increased after an initial lag of 17 h. In contrast the mRNA level of 11 beta-hydroxylase was differently regulated since it was elevated after 17 and 24 h and decreased thereafter to basal values. These increases appear to be related to ACTH secretion since they were blocked by the coadministration of dexamethasone (Dex) and 4-APP. Also 3 h after the administration of Dex to 4-APP treated rats rapid decreases in plasma corticosterone and ACTH levels were accompanied by decreases in mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase and low density lipoprotein receptor, two components involved in the synthesis and transport of cholesterol. The mRNA level of the electron donor adrenodoxin was also decreased, suggesting that this component participates in the short term regulation of corticosterone synthesis in the rat adrenal. The adrenal response was more readily observed with components involved in the steps preceding cholesterol biosynthesis than in those subsequent to cholesterol in the corticosteroid pathway. However, the effects of 4-APP on the latter pathway were well documented with mRNA analysis performed by Northern blot, a more sensitive technique than the Western blot used for protein quantification. The entire metabolism of the corticosterone biosynthetic pathway was thus affected in rats treated with 4-APP. Taken collectively these results indicate that under acute lipoprotein depletion rat adrenals developed a compensatory mechanism enabling them to synthesize and utilize cholesterol for corticosteroid synthesis.",

The most severely affected patients have had profound developmental delay, dysmorphic features, cataracts, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and anemia, as well as diarrhea and malabsorption, and have died in infancy. Less severely affected patients have had psychomotor retardation, hypotonia, myopathy, and ataxia. All patients have had recurrent crises in which there was fever, lymphadenopathy, increase in size of liver and spleen, arthralgia, edema, and a morbilliform rash. Neuroimaging studies revealed selective and progressive atrophy of the cerebellum. Mevalonic acid concentrations were found to be grossly elevated in body fluids of all patients. Concentrations of plasma cholesterol were normal or only slightly reduced. Concentrations of ubiquinone-10 in plasma were found to be decreased in most patients. Abnormalities such as hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, or lactic acidemia, the usual concomitants of disorders of organic acid metabolism, were conspicuously absent.",

    "66": "The authors report a case of rhabdomyolysis which occurred in a 61 year old woman who was receiving pravastatin and who was also found to present with type 1 macrocreatine kinase. Drug induced rhabdomyolysis is common, particularly with HMG Coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. The authors describe the onset of an adverse effect of this type with pravastatin, a recently marketed drug, as has been previously described for lovastatin and simvastatin. The concomitant detection of macrocreatine kinase, the incidence of which is estimated to be between 2 and 5% in the population, raises the question of whether rhabdomyolysis of this type may occur preferentially in patients with this biological anomaly.", 
    "67": "We studied the effects of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors simvastatin and pravastatin on the in vitro susceptibility of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidation. Twenty-three hypercholesterolaemic patients (mean serum cholesterol 9.7 mmol l-1) were treated with increasing doses of either simvastatin or pravastatin for 18 weeks. No significant differences in effect on lipid levels between the two drugs were found. Treatment resulted in lowering of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol by maximally 30% and 34%, respectively. Chemical composition analysis showed that LDL particles contained relatively more protein and less free cholesterol and cholesteryl-ester after treatment. The LDL cholesterol/protein ratio decreased from 1.24 +/- 0.21 to 0.97 +/- 0.23 (n = 20). By continuous monitoring of in vitro oxidation it appeared that LDL was less susceptible to oxidation after drug treatment. Maximal rate of diene production was significantly decreased from 19.7 +/- 3.1 to 18.5 +/- 3.3 nmol min-1 mg-1 LDL; total diene production decreased significantly from 420.3 +/- 67.6 to 380.5 +/- 49.1 nmol mg-1 LDL; the lag time was unchanged throughout the study. These studies show that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce the oxidizability of LDL by altering its composition.",

Group 1 had a 29.3% reduction of total and a 38.3% reduction of LDL cholesterol as against reductions of 9% and 9.6% respectively in group 2. No significant difference was observed between the two groups as far as the vascular events considered were concerned. Pravastatin is an effective and safe drug. The lack of influence on the evolution of vascular disease would appear to be correlated to the small number of subjects studied and the short follow-up.", 
    "69": "Seventy-seven hypercholesterolemic patients participated in a 26-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that investigated the efficacy and safety of pravastatin therapy. All patients had primary moderate hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol 200-300 mg/dl, at the end of a 6-week dietary run-in period) and two additional coronary risk factors. Pravastatin, 20-40 mg/day given at bedtime, reduced total cholesterol by 19-22%, LDL-cholesterol by 24-30%, triglycerides by 10-30% and increased HDL-cholesterol by 9-13%. The drug caused mild elevation in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Almost all these elevations were within normal limits and no patient was clinically symptomatic. No other significant differences were observed between the pravastatin and the placebo-treated groups with regard to other adverse effects and to patient compliance and withdrawal. It is concluded that pravastatin has a beneficial effect on the lipid profile and that the drug is safe and well tolerated.",

Lipids and lipoproteins play an important role in its pathogenesis. The authors treated a group of elderly patients with Simvastatin (20 mg/day for 1 year), a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor and observed a significant reduction in total cholesterol (p < 0.001). LDL (p < 0.001) and beta apolipoproteins (p < 0.05). They also achieved regression of the atherosclerotic plaque in 5 patients and arrested the atherosclerotic process in 8.

    "71": "The pharmacological potency of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (lisinopril and enalaprilat) on the transcription of low density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase genes was examined in human vascular smooth muscle cells and compared with the action of Ca(2+)-channel blockers (manidipine, verapamil, and diltiazem). Analogous to Ca(2+)-channel blockers, nanomolar concentrations of enalaprilat or lisinopril stimulated the synthesis of low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA and amplified the transcription induced by recombinant platelet-derived growth factor BB. In contrast to Ca(2+)-channel blockers, ACE inhibitors did not alter the transcription of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase gene. Platelet-derived growth factor BB stimulated the translocation of delta and epsilon isoforms of protein kinase C. Similar to Ca(2+)-channel blockers, ACE inhibitors reduced the translocation of delta and epsilon isoforms of protein kinase C. Furthermore, ACE inhibitors and Ca(2+)-channel blockers inhibited platelet-derived growth factor BB-induced transcription of c-fos and c-jun genes. The findings suggest that increased de novo synthesis of mRNA low density lipoprotein receptor apparently involves the participation of delta and epsilon isoforms of protein kinase C and transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun.",

The reactions were inhibited by the inhibitors for sulfotransferases, and 18OH was introduced to the 3'alpha- and 6'alpha-positions of R-416 and R-418, respectively, by incubation with H2 18O. These results strongly suggested that PV was metabolically activated by sulfation at the 6'beta-hydroxy group by sulfotransferases, followed by nucleophilic attack of hydroxy anions at the 3'alpha- or 6'alpha-position, to give R-416 or R-418, respectively.",

A diet high in fat and cholesterol and a placebo identical in appearance to the lovastatin were used as the respective controls. Each of the 97 patients completing the study (58 men and 39 women) underwent four consecutive nine-week periods of treatment according to a randomized, balanced design: a high-fat diet-placebo period, a low-fat diet-placebo period, a high-fat diet-lovastatin period, and a low-fat diet-lovastatin period.", 
    "75": "The level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was a mean of 5 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 7 percent) lower during the low-fat diet than during the high-fat diet (P < 0.001). With lovastatin therapy as compared with placebo, the reduction was 27 percent. Together, the low-fat diet and lovastatin led to a mean reduction of 32 percent in the level of LDL cholesterol. The level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol fell by 6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 8 percent) during the low-fat diet (P < 0.001) and rose by 4 percent during treatment with lovastatin (P < 0.001). The ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol and the level of total triglycerides were reduced by lovastatin (P < 0.001), but not by the low-fat diet.", 
    "76": "The effects of the low-fat-low-cholesterol diet and lovastatin on lipoprotein levels were independent and additive.

    "77": "Involvement in catalysis of a histidyl residue of Syrian hamster 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase was suggested by the ability of diethyl pyrocarbonate to abolish catalytic activity, accompanying spectral changes, and reactivation by hydroxylamine. The 7 histidines present in the catalytic domain of the hamster enzyme were changed to glutamine (His474, His487, His634, His751, His860, and His865), lysine (His865), or tyrosine (His868). Overexpression in Escherichia coli yielded six soluble mutant proteins, one insoluble protein (H634Q), and one which was degraded in vivo (H487Q). Following purification to homogeneity, mutant enzymes H474Q, H751Q, H860Q, and H868Y had essentially wild-type catalytic activity, while mutant enzymes H865K and H865Q had less than 0.6% wild-type activity. The low activity of mutant enzymes H865K and H865Q is unlikely to reflect altered structural integrity since both chromatographed on affinity supports like wild-type enzyme and had Km values for (S)-HMG-CoA (31 and 16 microM) and for NADPH (60 and 24 microM) close to those for wild-type enzyme (31 and 52 microM for (S)-HMG-CoA and NADPH, respectively). His865 of hamster HMG-CoA reductase, the histidine of the consensus Leu-Val-Xaa-Ser-His-Met-Xaa-Xaa-Asn-Arg-Ser motif and the only histidine conserved among the catalytic domains of all HMG-CoA reductases, thus appears to be a general acid/base functional in catalysis.", 
    "78": "Crilvastatin is a drug from the pyrrolidone family that had been shown to induce non-competitive inhibition of rat hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase activity in vitro. The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of crilvastatin on the hepatic metabolism of cholesterol in rats. Crilvastatin increased low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol uptake by the liver more than high density lipoprotein (HDL) uptake, thus increasing by up 30% the clearance of excess plasma cholesterol. In normolipidemic rats, crilvastatin significantly enhanced acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl transferase and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. In rats with a previous high cholesterolemia, crilvastatin also enhanced cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and did not increase liver acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl transferase activity. These findings suggest that a drug such as crilvastatin could have a hypocholesterolemic effect by a mechanism other than the sole inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, possibly by stimulating cholesterol and bile salt secretion via the biliary tract in previously hypercholesterolemic rats.", 
    "79": "The effect of fluvastatin sodium (XU62-320), a new type of inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A, on the induction of LDL receptor in the human liver-derived cell line HepG2 was investigated. Fluvastatin sodium produced marked inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and induction of LDL receptor on HepG2 cells at a concentration of 0.1-1.0 microM. These results suggest that fluvastatin sodium has potential for use as a strong plasma cholesterol-lowering drug.", 
    "80": "Statin is a 57 kD protein previously reported to be expressed by cells in G0. We have studied the detailed distribution of statin immunoreactivity in normal human and rat tissues, and correlated this with investigation of in vitro model systems. By laser confocal microscopy, statin immunoreactivity is localized to the nuclear membrane. In contrast to previous reports, using in vitro model systems we found that statin was also expressed by replicating cells as judged by both co-localization with [3H]thymidine-labelled and Ki67-labelled cells. Furthermore, in a nude mouse xenograft model the number of statin-labelled cells exceeded the number of quiescent cells as assessed by both fraction of labelled mitosis methods and labelling with [3H]thymidine and Ki67. We conclude that although there is an association between expression of the 57 kD nuclear membrane protein statin and growth arrest, this is not absolute and it is expressed in a sub-population of cycling cells. The properties of statin closely resemble those of nuclear lamins, members of the intermediate filament family.", 
    "81": "The influence of the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors pravastatin and simvastatin on lens cholesterol metabolism was investigated in the rat. Short-term organ culture experiments with explanted lenses from 21-day-old Wistar rats showed that simvastatin was at least 35 times more effective than pravastatin in inhibiting cholesterol synthesis. In vivo the cholesterol content of the rat lens increased linearly with age. Experiments were designed to answer the question whether simvastatin and pravastatin inhibit lens cholesterol synthesis in vivo, which would result in a reduced cholesterol accumulation in the lens with age. Young Wistar rats were weaned at an age of 21 days and had ad libitum access to a chow supplemented with 10-100 mg vastatin kg-1 (drug consumption: 1.5-15 mg vastatin kg-1 body weight day-1, respectively) or no additions for 3 weeks. Both drugs induced the HMG-CoA reductase activity in rat liver microsomes (isolated after 1, 2 and 3 weeks of treatment) to a similar extent. This indicates that the two drugs inhibited hepatic cholesterol synthesis to a comparable extent. During the whole treatment period no significant differences between control and drug-treated animals could be observed when the wet weight and protein content of the lenses were considered. However, a striking difference between the control group and pravastatin group (50 mg drug kg-1 diet) on the one hand and the simvastatin group (50 mg drug kg-1 diet) on the other was observed when the cholesterol content of the lenses were compared as a function of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors effectively reduce the concentration of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in plasma. Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] may be as atherogenic as LDL. A few studies, only one of which was placebo controlled, suggest that the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors either do not affect Lp(a) or they increase Lp(a). The response of Lp(a) to HMG-CoA reductase inhibition has not been related to apolipoprotein(a) phenotypes in previous studies. We conducted a double-blind, placebo controlled study of pravastatin in 51 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (n = 43) or probable FH (n = 8). All patients had LDL-cholesterol concentration above 4.1 mmol l-1 despite treatment with diet and bile acid sequestration. In patients assigned to pravastatin (n = 34), the mean concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol fell significantly (P < 0.01) when compared to placebo. Lp(a) increased (P < 0.01) from a mean (+/- SD) of 33.6 +/- 40.8 mg dl-1 to 41.1 +/- 46.1 mg dl-1 on pravastatin but was unchanged during placebo treatment. The percentage increase in Lp(a) was the same in patients with different apo(a) phenotypes, and hence the absolute increase in Lp(a) was greatest in patients with the low molecular weight apo(a) phenotypes.",

Therefore, the postprandial chylomicron remnant clearance was studied in nine normolipidemic untreated controls and seven FCH patients before and after treatment with simvastatin using an oral vitamin A-fat load (24 hours, 50 g/m2). Treatment with simvastatin reduced plasma cholesterol level by 16% (mean +/- SEM, 8.1 +/- 0.8 v 6.8 +/- 0.8 mmol/L; P < .05) and plasma apolipoprotein (apo) B level by 19% (1.6 +/- 0.2 v 1.3 +/- 0.2 g/L; P < .05). Plasma apo E level (89.6 +/- 21.0 mg/L) was reduced by 29% (63.5 +/- 14.1 mg/L; P < .05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels did not change; consequently, the reductions seen had been due to a decrease in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels. Fasting plasma triglyceride (30% reduction) and plasma apo C-II (31% reduction) levels did not change significantly. Mean postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity increased by 13% after treatment (90.4 +/- 19.8 v 102.6 +/- 20.3 mU/mL; P < .05), but hepatic lipase (HL) activity was not altered. The clearance of chylomicrons (Sf > 1,000), expressed as the area under the 24-hour retinyl palmitate curve, did not change with simvastatin (52.8 +/- 12.9 v 51.8 +/- 13.4 h.mg-1/L).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "In this study, plasma HDL fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation and apo A-I containing lipoproteins (A-I Lp) were then isolated using anti-apo A-I immunoaffinity chromatography. The A-I Lp were further separated into two fractions with the use of anti-apo A-II immunoaffinity chromatography. One fraction, Lp A-I, contained apo A-I without apo A-II, while the other, Lp A-I/A-II, contained both apo A-I and apo A-II. These techniques were applied to investigate the changes in HDL apoprotein composition in hypercholesterolemic subjects treated with either probucol or pravastatin. Treatment with probucol (500 mg/day) or pravastatin (10 mg/day) reduced mean plasma total cholesterol concentrations by 24% (p < 0.01) and 16% (p < 0.05), respectively. Both drugs caused some reduction in lipoprotein lipase activity, but neither had any influence on the activity of hepatic triglyceride lipase or lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase. Their effects on HDL-cholesterol levels and apoprotein composition differed markedly. Probucol significantly decreased the HDL-cholesterol concentration, the plasma apo A-I/apo A-II ratio, and the number of large particles of diameter greater than 10.4 nm. When the ratios of Lp A-I and Lp A-I/A-II for the probucol-treated subjects were compared with those in the normolipidemic controls, and with the ratios before and after administration of probucol, a remarkable decrease in the level of Lp A-I was apparent. It is presumed that the decrease in HLD-cholesterol by prolonged probucol administration reflects the decrease of Lp A-I more than the decrease of Lp A-I/A-II.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The contralateral carotid artery served as a sham control. Pravastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin were given mixed with food at daily doses of 20 mg/kg body wt for 2 weeks starting on the day of collar placement. The treatment with vastatins did not modify rabbit plasma cholesterol concentrations. The neointimal formation was assessed by measuring the cross-sectional thickness of intimal and medial tissues of fixed arteries with light microscopy. Fourteen days after collar placement, intimal hyperplasia (mostly cellular) was pronounced in treated carotid arteries. The intimal/medial (I/M) tissue ratio was 12-fold higher in treated arteries than in arteries without the collar (0.36 +/- 0.04 versus 0.03 +/- 0.02). Animals treated with lovastatin (n = 12), simvastatin (n = 12), and fluvastatin (n = 12) showed significantly less neointimal formation; I/M tissue ratios were 0.24 +/- 0.03, 0.20 +/- 0.03, and 0.17 +/- 0.03, respectively. The inhibition elicited by pravastatin (n = 12, 0.32 +/- 0.03) did not reach statistical significance. alpha-Actin antibody immunofluorescence analysis of serial sections revealed that cells present in the hyperplastic intima were mostly myocytes. Rates of intimal myocyte proliferation were also measured by incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, a thymidine analogue, into replicating DNA. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine was actively incorporated into intimal myocytes after ++reinsertion of the collar, with a labeling index (percent of labeled myocytes) of 2.15 after 14 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "87": "Five classes of lipid-lowering drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States: nicotinic acid, bile acid sequestrants, fibric acid derivatives, reductase inhibitors, and probucol. None of the agents has an antiatherosclerotic indication. Cholestyramine and gemfibrozil have received indications for preventing complications of atherosclerosis, namely, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease death. Foreseeable pharmacological strategies to reduce lipid-related cardiovascular risk might be divided into three categories. First, the present approach of lowering lipid and lipoprotein concentrations might be extended through modification of available agents (e.g., a more potent or soluble bile acid resin) or development of agents of novel mechanism (e.g., acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase [ACAT] inhibition or inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis at a step other than HMG-CoA reductase). Second, blood lipids could be directly addressed outside of lipid-lowering strategies. Raising high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels has not been fully explored, or the target might be modification of the lipoproteins themselves rather than their concentrations. Areas of particular interest in the latter regard are hepatic lipase activity, cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity, and differences between oxidized or otherwise modified low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and normal LDL. Third, it may be possible to directly lessen the atherosclerotic potential of the vessel wall (e.g., through protecting it from the effects of certain growth factors or altering its state of relaxation.", 
    "88": "Disorders associated with the overproduction or delayed clearance of beta-very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein (LDL) are strikingly related to premature coronary artery disease. There are five recognized classes of LDL-lowering drugs, each acting through different basic mechanisms. The increased predictability, safety, and efficacy of newer lipid-lowering agents have allowed controlled clinical trials to demonstrate conclusively that reducing LDL leads to a reduction in coronary artery disease. Fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is almost completely absorbed, actively targeted to the liver, and secreted in the bile. It has no active circulating metabolites. The safety and efficacy of fluvastatin have been demonstrated in more than 2,500 subjects treated in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and more than 1,000 have been treated for more than 1 year. Combination of fluvastatin with cholestyramine results in additional cholesterol lowering. The Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study, a randomized, double-blind trial of fluvastatin using quantitative coronary angiography to measure atherosclerotic plaque change and positron emission tomography to evaluate myocardial perfusion (myocardial flow reserve), illustrates the further exploration of lipoproteins and atherogenesis made possible by the availability of this new generation of cholesterol-lowering agents.",

The mean percent changes from baseline in LDL cholesterol at weeks 6, 12 and 18 were -28, -33 and -39%, respectively, with lovastatin, and -19, -25 and -27%, respectively, with pravastatin. All changes were significantly different from 0 (p < 0.001), and the between-group differences were highly significant (p < 0.001). The frequency of adverse events leading to discontinuation was low (2.9% with lovastatin, and 2.4% with pravastatin), with no significant differences between groups. Across the recommended dosage ranges, lovastatin was more effective than pravastatin in reducing total and LDL cholesterol; however, both agents had similar safety profiles.", 
    "94": "Veterans are frequently older, have more chronic illnesses, and take more medications than subjects volunteering for clinical trials. Because these factors may impair the effectiveness of lipid-lowering drug therapy, the effectiveness of drug therapy in veterans may differ from that measured in randomized controlled trials. In 297 patients with type IIa hyperlipidemia attending a large Veterans Administration Medical Center lipid clinic, adverse effects, compliance, lipid and lipoprotein responses to drug therapy were prospectively monitored. Bile acid sequestrants (4 packets/day) were associated with a high rate of adverse effects, and had the highest drug discontinuance rate (37%) and poorest compliance (73 +/- 3% of the doses prescribed reported ingested) of all agents. Patients aged > 60 years tolerated therapy with bile acid sequestrants less well than did younger veterans (p < 0.01). Niacin (1.5 g/day) also had a high drug discontinuance rate (27%). Lovastatin (20 mg/day) had the lowest drug discontinuance rate (2%) and the highest compliance (90 +/- 2%). Lovastatin also reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol the most (-21.6 +/- 2.0%), whereas niacin produced the largest increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (+/- 14.3 +/- 2.2%); both niacin and lovastatin produced similar reductions in the LDL/HDL ratio. However, psyllium (10.4 g/day) reduced LDL cholesterol by only 2%, and had no effect on the LDL/HDL ratio. Psyllium produced larger LDL cholesterol reductions in patients aged < 60 years than in older patients (p < 0.01). Niacin and lovastatin are effective drugs for hypercholesterolemia management in the Veterans Administration Medical Center setting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "95": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether lovastatin treatment reduced very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) abnormalities in hypertriglyceridemic subjects. Lovastatin reduced plasma triglyceride levels and the levels of total VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The numbers of VLDL particles of Sf 100-400 and Sf 60-100 but not Sf 20-60 particles were reduced by lovastatin, as was the amount of cholesteryl ester per particle. All VLDL subspecies bound to the LDL receptor of cultured human fibroblasts with similar, high affinities on both placebo and lovastatin, but VLDL Sf 100-400 and VLDL Sf 60-100 caused less suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity after lovastatin therapy, indicating reduced LDL receptor-mediated cholesterol delivery. The average decrease in reductase suppression by VLDL Sf 100-400 after lovastatin was 32%, similar to the 34% average decrease in cholesteryl ester content of VLDL Sf 100-400 after lovastatin. Although statistical significance was not achieved, there was a trend toward decreased VLDL Sf 100-400-induced rapid, receptor-mediated triglyceride accumulation in P388D1 macrophages after lovastatin. Taken together, these observations suggest that lovastatin may be of potential benefit in decreasing the atherosclerotic complications of hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "96": "To develop efficient bovine leukemia virus (BLV) protease (PR) inhibitors, pure enzyme is required. For this, we have developed a two-step chromatographic nondenaturing purification protocol of PR from virions. As expected, the purified protein presents a molecular weight (14 kDa) and a NH2 terminal end fitting with previously reported data. The enzymatic activity of BLV PR was characterized using a synthetic peptide containing a potential cleavage site of the BLV gag-pro polypeptide precursor as substrate. The protease was most active at pH 6, 40 degrees, and high salt concentration (1-2 M NaCl or ammonium sulfate). In contrast, using a natural substrate such as a human T-cell leukemia virus recombinant gag precursor, BLV PR activity was higher at a low salt concentration (0.5 M NaCl). Besides, the use of different potentially cleavable molecules revealed that PR activity may be influenced by the substrate conformational structure around the cleavage site. Replacement of the two amino acids of a synthetic substrate cleavable site by a statin residue completely inhibited the enzymatic activity of the BLV PR.", 
    "97": "The efficacy on plasma lipids, apo A1 and B of a HMG Co A Reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, and a fibrate derivative, gemfibrozil, were compared in 136 hypercholesterolemic patients. The study was randomized, double-blinded and the active drug was given after a 4 week period of placebo. Gemfibrozil (n = 69) was given at 900 mg q.p.m. during the entire study. The primary dose of simvastatin was 10 mg q.p.m. during the first 6-weeks of treatment. At the end of this period, the dose was doubled if the cholesterol level was above 2 g/l (5,16 mmol/l). The same modification was carried out 12 weeks after the beginning active drug treatment with the same criteria. The baselines of total cholesterol were 3.24 +/- 0.69 g/l (8.38 +/- 1.78 mmol/l) 3.21 +/- 0.72 g/l (8.31 +/- 1.87 mmol/l) for patients with simvastatin and those with gemfibrozil respectively. So, at the end of active treatment, 64% of patients in the simvastatin group (n = 67) received 40 mg q.p.m. After 18 weeks of treatment, 89% of patients treated with Simvastatin and 37% with gemfibrozil had more than 20% reduction in LDL cholesterol. Simvastatin was more efficient on total cholesterol, LDL-C and apo B. The increase of HDL-C is similar in both groups of patients. In contrast, the level of triglycerides was further decreased by gemfibrozil. The tolerance was good in the two groups of patients and no difference in the frequency of side effects was observed.", 
    "98": "In the present study, we examined the levels of plasma lipids and apolipoproteins in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) with hypercholesterolemia in different apolipoprotein E (apo E) phenotypes. We also examined the influences of apo E polymorphism on the response to pravastatin. The patients were divided into three groups, E4/E3, E3/E3, and E3/E2. There were no differences in the baseline levels of plasma lipids and apolipoproteins, except that the level of triglycerides in E3/E2 heterozygotes was significantly higher than E3/E3 homozygotes. Three months of pravastatin administration significantly reduced plasma levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in each group to the same degree. We observed a significant reduction of apo B both in the E4/E3 and E3/E3 groups and apo E in the E3/E3 group. Such reduction was not observed in the E3/E2 group. We conclude that pravastatin is a potent drug to correct lipid abnormalities, particularly in NIDDM patients with apo E4/E3 and E3/E3. In the E3/E2 group, its effectiveness may be diminished.", 
    "99": "Platelets are involved in the initiation of atheromas and arterial thrombosis and thus may play a cardinal role in the pathogenesis of myocardial and cerebral infarction. In 18 patients with coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia resistant to low-lipid diet a 12 week treatment with lovastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) leads to the reduction of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides but also to a marked increase of platelet activity. Lovastatin is an inactive lacton prodrug which must be enzymatically or chemically transformed to the active form. In in-vitro experiments, it was discovered that both chemically hydrolysed lovastatin and plasma containing lovastatin metabolites stimulate induced platelet aggregation in whole blood samples. \"Essential\" phospholipids (Lipostabil) added to the blood samples in concentrations according to those which are used clinically prevent this stimulation. This corresponds to data obtained earlier from Lipostabil-treated ischemic heart disease patients. Besides a lipid-lowering effect Lipostabil showed a 50% reduction of spontaneous aggregates in plasma, an increase of the susceptibility threshold to aggregation inducers and a decrease of the platelet aggregation amplitude in whole blood samples. Therefore, it would be promising to combine the therapy by lovastatin with \"essential\" phospholipids possessing a remarkable improving effect on the platelet function based on a molecular action independent of their moderate lipid-reducing action.", 
    "100": "Hyperlipidemia is frequently seen in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients. The cause of abnormal lipid profile in these patients is multifactorial. In both short and long term studies, abnormal levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and, HDL cholesterol were observed. In short term studies, both lovastatin and gemfibrozil were shown to favorably alter the lipid profile.", 
    "101": "Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) was eliminated by LDL-apheresis using a dextran sulfate cellulose column in 3 homozygous and 10 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemic patients. Immediately after LDL-apheresis by the LA-15 system (continuous LDL apheresis), there were significant reductions in Lp(a) concentrations (28.6 +/- 11.8 mg/dl (mean +/- S.E.) to 9.6 +/- 5.6 mg/dl (P < 0.01)), and in LDL-cholesterol concentrations (156 +/- 32 mg/dl to 48 +/- 18 mg/dl (P < 0.01)). Immediately following LDL-apheresis, Lp(a) and LDL-cholesterol were reduced by 67.4% +/- 11.6% and 68.3% +/- 11.8%, respectively. The removal of Lp(a) paralleled that of LDL-cholesterol. The reduced levels of Lp(a) nearly returned to baseline within 7 days. In 6 of the heterozygous FH patients the rates of recovery of LDL cholesterol and Lp(a) were calculated, according to Apstein's equation after discontinuing lipid altering drug treatment for 4 weeks. Mean constant k values of LDL cholesterol and Lp(a) were 0.354 (range: 0.136-0.752) and 0.427 (range 0.112-0.933), respectively. The average concentration during the 7 days following LDL-apheresis was calculated. Average reductions were 28% in LDL cholesterol and 18% in Lp(a). Pravastatin treatment, which continued for 4 weeks, significantly decreased LDL cholesterol (P < 0.01); however, before LDL-apheresis pravastatin treatment significantly increased Lp(a) levels (P < 0.05) in a small number (n = 6) of the FH patients, who had been regularly treated with LDL-apheresis. These results suggest that LDL-apheresis using the dextran sulfate cellulose column is an effective treatment to reduce levels of serum Lp(a) and LDL proportionally. This therapy may be of value in the prevention and regression of coronary artery disease in FH patients.", 
    "102": "Eleven men with hypoalphalipoproteinemia (HPAL; fasting plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level of < 0.9 mmol/l), mild hypertriglyceridemia (HTG; triglycerides (TG) level of 1.75-7.5 mmol/l) and a normal calculated LDL cholesterol level (< 3.7 mmol/l) participated in a randomized, double-blind, double-placebo, crossover trial to compare the effect of two drugs, lovastatin (40 mg once daily) and gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily), on clearance of postprandial lipoproteins. A 2-week washout period separated drug treatment periods of 6 weeks each. Ten subjects completed each treatment period. After ingestion of a vitamin A fat load, plasma, chylomicron and non-chylomicron retinyl palmitate (RP) and TG responses (areas under curves) were reduced in all subjects on gemfibrozil therapy and in 7 on lovastatin therapy. There was close correlation between change in fasting TG (but not fasting HDL-cholesterol) and change in postprandial RP areas on gemfibrozil but not lovastatin therapy. Postheparin lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities were increased by gemfibrozil therapy while only a mild elevation in LPL activity alone was seen on lovastatin therapy. These data indicate that improvement in HTG is the main feature associated with improvement in postprandial lipemia and this is likely due to LPL-mediated enhancement of lipolytic hydrolysis. Gemfibrozil is more effective than lovastatin in attenuating postprandial lipemia in the HPAL/HTG syndrome.", 
    "103": "Using insect (Drosophila) and rodent mammalian cell cultures we demonstrate that acute mevalonate-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A was initiated in the absence of protein synthesis. In addition, insect and mammalian cells depleted (1 h) of putative regulatory post-isopentenyl-1-pyrophosphate metabolites by incubation with an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase (L-659,699) accumulated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase enzyme units. This accumulation resulted primarily from a decrease in the loss of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase enzyme units rather than from an increase in enzyme synthesis. These observations suggest that the initial phase of mevalonate-mediated suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity was governed primarily by post-translational processes. An unknown rapidly turning over post-isopentenyl-1-pyrophosphate metabolite(s) is proposed as the agonist for these post-translational processes.", 
    "104": "A concentration-dependent inactivation of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase was found on preincubation of rat liver microsomal preparations with H2O2 and at lower concentrations in the presence of KCN which inhibited the contaminating catalase. The inactivation was not affected in the presence quenchers of hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen and was also obtained when H2O2 was added during the reaction. HMG-CoA, but not NADPH, partially protected the enzyme from H2O2-inactivation. Even at high concentration DTT was unable to reverse this inactivation. The soluble 50 kDa-enzyme was similarly inactivated by H2O2, and the tryptic-digest of the inactivated protein indicated the presence of a disulfide-containing peptide. The results support the view that H2O2 by directly acting on the catalytic domain possibly converts an active thiol group to an inaccessible disulfide and irreversibly inactivates HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "105": "We have administered the hypolipaemic drugs simvastatin and cholestyramine to rats, both separately and together, to determine whether drug-induced changes in plasma apo lipoprotein levels occur through regulation of hepatic genes coding for apolipoproteins (apos) AI, AIV, E and B. Cholestyramine alone had little effect on either the plasma levels of the apolipoproteins studied or their hepatic mRNA levels. However, simvastatin, either alone or in combination with cholestyramine, produced marked changes in both of these parameters. While simvastatin plus cholestyramine lowered mRNAs for apo AIV, apo E and apo B by 50%, 37%, and 55%, respectively, the treatment resulted in an increase of 150% in apo AI mRNA. This combined drug treatment caused a lowering in plasma concentration of all four apolipoproteins which failed to reach significance with apo E. Relative to controls, the values decreased to 83 +/- 14% for apo AI, 67 +/- 8% for apo AIV and 73 +/- 15 for apo B. An important novel finding of the present study, was that hypolipaemic drugs caused the apo B mRNA levels in rat liver to decrease. Previous reports have shown that although dietary fat or hormones caused marked changes in the concentration of circulating lipoproteins, they failed to alter apo B mRNA content. We suggest that the synthesis of apo B is subject to both pre- and post-translational regulation.", 
    "106": "This study aimed to investigate the influence of the hypocholesterolemic drugs pravastatin and lovastatin on the cholesterol biosynthesis in the ocular lens. Two model systems were used: a human lens organ culture system and an in vivo rat lens system. For measurements of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis rates, human lenses were incubated for 20 h in the presence of [14C]acetate. Pravastatin and lovastatin were added 1 h prior to the addition of the radioactive label. In order to avoid the influence of differences relating to individual donors, one lens from each donor was incubated without drug (control) and the other lens was incubated in the presence of the drug. Statistical analysis showed that the fatty acid synthesis rate was not influenced by the drug. For each lens pair the percentage inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis caused by the drug was calculated. Using various concentrations of the drugs, a dose-response curve was composed for the inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis. The experiments showed that in the human lens organ culture system, lovastatin was 100-fold more potent than pravastatin in inhibiting the cholesterol biosynthesis. To study the in vivo influence of vastatins on the cholesterol content of the developing lens, Wistar rats were weaned at day 21 of age and subsequently the pups were fed a control diet or drug-containing diet (10, 50 or 100 mg lovastatin/kg chow) for a 3-week period. At the end of diet intervention, doses of 50 or 100 mg lovastatin/kg chow had caused a reduction of about 20% of the lenticular cholesterol content compared with controls. No effect on the lens cholesterol content by pravastatin was observed. Both human ex vivo and rat in vivo experiments show that lovastatin much more strongly inhibits the lenticular cholesterol synthesis than does pravastatin.", 
    "107": "Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is a common lipid disorder characterized by high levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, or both. The basic metabolic abnormality is overproduction of apolipoprotein B-100. High atherogenicity has been attributed to all forms of FCHL. We evaluated combined bezafibrate-lovastatin therapy in 10 patients (9 men and 1 woman) with FCHL and markedly high cholesterol and triglyceride levels who were at high risk of coronary artery disease and who had not responded to diet and bezafibrate treatment alone. Eight patients had coronary artery disease, 6 had hypertension, and 3 had noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Lovastatin 20 mg/day was added to the bezafibrate 600 mg/day regimen for 6 weeks; the lovastatin dosage was then doubled to 40 mg/day for an additional 6 weeks. The addition of 20 mg of lovastatin resulted in decreases of 15%, 20%, and 13% in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, respectively. Increasing the dose of lovastatin to 40 mg resulted in further moderate decreases of 4%, 3%, and 8% in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, respectively, compared with the 20 mg/day dosage. Although previous reports have emphasized the potential side effects of combination treatment with lovastatin and fibric acid derivatives, our patients tolerated the regimen well, with no significant subjective complaints or laboratory abnormalities. The bezafibrate-lovastatin combination is a possible therapeutic option for severe, resistant FCHL, but close medical supervision is needed because of potential side effects.", 
    "108": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin on some aspects of cholesterol metabolism in cholesterol-fed rabbits. The plasma cholesterol concentration was markedly lower in lovastatin-treated rabbits (6 mg/rabbit/day) compared to controls after 36 days of cholesterol-feeding (x +/- S.E.) (19 +/- 4 mmol/l, n = 9 versus 153 +/- 17 mmol/l, n = 7) (P < 0.00001). Intestinal absorption of cholesterol in such rabbits was reduced by 15% in lovastatin-treated rabbits (n = 21) compared to controls (n = 18) (P < 0.025). The results suggest that the hypocholesterolaemic effect of lovastatin in cholesterol-fed rabbits is associated with a decreased intestinal absorption of cholesterol.", 
    "109": "Several epidemiological and clinical studies have underlined the close relationship between hypercholesterolemia and risk of coronary heart disease suggesting the opportunity of treating hypercholesterolemic patients according to their associated risk factors. Simvastatin, a drug for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, is a competitive inhibitor of 3-Hydroxy-Methyl-Glutaryl-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. In the present study we have assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of simvastatin (10-20 mg) administered once daily for a period of 12 months to 50 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or at high risk for CHD according to the National Cholesterol Education Program. All patients underwent complete physical examination and laboratory safety tests (including blood cell count, liver function tests, creatine kinase and lipid profile) at baseline and every 6 weeks during treatment. Simvastatin was highly effective in reducing total and LDL cholesterol (-25% and -35% respectively). No significant effect on HDL cholesterol or triglycerides was obtained. Two patients were excluded after 6 weeks of treatment because of a serum creatine kinase increase (more than twice normal values). This was the only drug related side effect. In conclusion our data show that: a) simvastatin treatment is well accepted and compliance is good; b) the effect of simvastatin is evident after the first 6 weeks of treatment and is maintained during the whole treatment time; c) simvastatin is highly effective in lowering total and LDL cholesterol. When considering a patient who has had an atherosclerotic event the best deterrent to the occurrence of a subsequent event (secondary prevention) could be reduction of serum total and LDL cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "110": "Hyperlipidemic patients often have an accelerated esterified cholesterol transfer (ECT) from high density lipoproteins (HDL) to very low (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL). We investigated the effect of simvastatin on ECT in twelve normolipidemic subjects. After 6 weeks of simvastatin administration, ECT was decreased by 23%. To determine the mechanism of action of simvastatin, we measured ECT in different recombination experiments, using an isotopic assay in which the transfer of labelled EC from HDL to VLDL/LDL was determined. When HDL of the treated subjects were incubated with VLDL/LDL and CETP fractions isolated from control plasma, no effect of simvastatin was observed, indicating that the drug did not alter the HDL-dependent ECT. This might be expected since simvastatin induced only minor modifications of HDL structure. When HDL and VLDL/LDL of control plasma were incubated with CETP fractions of the treated subjects, a clear reduction of ECT occurred after simvastatin administration. The decrease of plasma transfer activity was correlated to that of CETP concentration and accounted for the simvastatin-induced lowering of ECT. The diminution of plasma CETP was correlated to that of the apo B-containing lipoproteins concentration. This finding confirms previous reports suggesting a relationship between LDL level and CETP activity. In conclusion, our work shows that simvastatin administration results in a decrease of ECT and that this effect occurs through a lowering of plasma CETP activity."
