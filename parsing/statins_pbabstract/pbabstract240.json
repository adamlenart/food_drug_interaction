We therefore investigated the in vitro inhibitory activity of various statins against Aspergillus fumigatus alone and in combination with antifungal drugs. Fresh conidial suspensions from 10 clinical isolates of A. fumigatus were obtained. The MIC and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M-38A protocol and the fungicidal activity by time-kill study. Fluvastatin (FST) showed good activity (MIC, 2 mg/L; MFC, 4 mg/L) against A. fumigatus; other statins had no activity (MIC > or = 256 mg/L). FST enhanced the activity of caspofungin (CFG) against A. fumigatus; subinhibitory concentrations of FST in combination with CFG showed >99.9% killing of A. fumigatus conidia, whereas either drug alone showed poor activity at subinhibitory concentrations. FST potentiated the antifungal activity of CFG but displayed no specific interaction with voriconazole or amphotericin B.",

    "4": "Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) might be involved in the progression of renal disease. Ox-LDL stimulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression via transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smad signaling in mesangial cells required activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Mevalonate depletion by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, decreases the levels of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) for isoprenylation of Ras. We postulate that statins may ameliorate the Ox-LDL-induced mesangial matrix accumulation by inhibiting Ras/ERK activation with subsequent downregulation of TGF-beta target genes. Quiescent mesangial cells were incubated for 18 h with and without the presence of lovastatin before 50 microg/mL of Ox-LDL treatment for 1 h. Lovastatin inhibited markedly the stimulatory effects of Ox-LDL on ERK1/2 activation, nuclear Smad3 expression, TGF-beta1 and PAI-1 mRNA and protein expression, and PAI-1 luciferase activity. These inhibitory effects of lovastatin were reversed almost completely by mevalonate or FPP. Similar to lovastatin, FTI-277, which is an inhibitor of Ras farnesylation, decreased the Ox-LDL-induced activation of ERK/Smad3 and induction of TGF-beta1/PAI-1. These results indicate that lovastatin prevents the Ox-LDL-induced Ras/ERK activation that results in inhibition of Smad3 activation in mesangial cells with subsequent downregulation of TGF-beta target genes. Thus, statins seem to have antifibrotic effects through their anti-TGF-beta response that are relevant in the treatment of chronic renal disease with dyslipidemia.",

Forty-eight patients with ACS were randomly divided into two groups: group C receiving conventional therapy (n=24), and group C+A receiving conventional therapy+atorvastatin (10 mg/day, n=24). T lymphocytes from ACS patients (before and 2 weeks after the treatment) or 18 healthy subjects were separated and the flow cytometry was used to measure the percentage of Treg. The inhibitory ability of Treg on effector T cells was determined by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). ELISA was used to measure the serum levels of cytokines (IL-10, TGF-beta1 and IFN-gamma) before and after treatment. The results showed that as compared with normal control group, Treg percentage was decreased significantly (P<0.01), the inhibitory ability of Treg on the T lymphocytes proliferation was reduced (P<0.01), IFN-gamma levels were increased and IL-10 and TGF-beta1 levels were lowered in ACS patients. After treatment with atorvastatin, Treg percentage and the inhibitory ability of Treg on T lymphocytes proliferation were significantly increased in ACS patients. Serum IFN-gamma was decreased significantly, while IL-10 and TGF-beta1 were elevated significantly as compared with the non-atorvastatin group. The number of Treg was positively correlated with serum TGF-beta1, but negatively with serum IFN-gamma and CRP. It was concluded that ACS was associated with decreased number and defected function of Treg, which may play an important role in initiating immune-inflammatory response in ACS. The inhibitory effects of atorvastatin on inflammation in ACS may be due to its beneficial effects on Treg and restoration of immune homeostasis.",

Clinical trial results also suggest that achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels even lower than those currently recommended can produce improved clinical outcomes across a range of patient types.

    "31": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to exert several vascular protective effects that are not related to changes in cholesterol profile, and these effects of statins are partly caused by the activation of angiogenesis. Endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and migration are crucial events for angiogenesis and statins are known to enhance these events. However, the molecular mechanism by which statins promote EC proliferation and migration is not fully understood. In this study, we show Akt and its downstream target mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) play an important role in pravastatin-induced EC proliferation and migration. We found that pravastatin significantly enhanced the proliferation and migration of rat aortic endothelial cells (rAECs). The addition of pravastatin to rAECs resulted in rapid phosphorylation of Akt and p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K). LY294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), blocked both Akt and p70S6K phosphorylation, whereas rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of mTOR, suppressed only p70S6K phosphorylation induced by pravastatin. Furthermore, both LY294002 and rapamycin inhibited pravastatin-induced rAEC proliferation and migration. Taken together, our findings indicate that pravastatin activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR /p70S6K signaling in this sequential manner and this pathway contributes to pravastatin-induced rAEC proliferation and migration.",

The exception was significantly lower cholesterol measurement and control in people with CHD, diabetes and stroke attending very remote practices (p<0.01) and beta-blocker prescription in CHD (p = 0.01).", 
    "38": "Under QOF, there are few differences in the quality of care delivered to patients in practices with different degrees of remoteness. The differences in achievement for cholesterol were consistent with lower rates of statin prescribing relative to disease burden in very remote practices.

The present study investigated whether the pleiotropic action of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors in upregulating endothelial function could also protect against the MCT-induced end-organ damages. Rosuvastatin (2 mg kg(-1) day(-1) via oral gavage) or placebo was initiated 1 wk before or 1 wk after MCT (60 mg/kg ip) administration. One month after MCT, significant PAH developed in the placebo rats, which were accompanied by histological evidence of pulmonary vascular thickening and right ventricular hypertrophy. The coronary endothelial vasodilatory function, assessed with endothelial/nitric oxide-dependent responses to acetylcholine and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), was depressed, while the constrictory responses to known coronary constrictors was enhanced. In rats that received rosuvastatin treatment 1 wk before MCT administration, a significantly reduced PAH and RVH was observed, as well as reduced pulmonary vascular and right ventricular remodelings. Rosuvastatin 1-wk posttreatment had no effect on PAH, but inhibited RVH. Right coronary endothelial dysfunction, which was shown in placebo rats, was effectively prevented by both pre- and postrosuvastatin treatment, while this effect was more dramatic in the pretreated group. Left coronary endothelial function, which was not affected by MCT, also showed an upregulation by rosuvastatin. Taken together, our results demonstrated the pleiotropic protection of rosuvastatin against the development of PAH and RVH and confirmed our previous finding that the targeted preservation of coronary endothelial function and vasoactivity may provide a novel approach to protect against cardiac remodeling.",

This post-hoc study was by nature exploratory, and, because data from such analyses are not customarily adjusted for multiple comparisons, some associations may have emerged as statistically significant by chance. Future prospective randomized controlled studies may help to confirm our findings and address other research issues, such as the generalizability of our findings to patients with CHD or diabetes mellitus and possible dose:response relationships between escalating statin (or ezetimibe-statin) doses and circulating non-cholesterol levels.",

    "51": "It is well recognized that the lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can substantially reduce coronary artery disease (CAD)-related morbidity and mortality. The prevention and management of CAD has chiefly focused on 1 component of the lipid profile: the reduction of LDL cholesterol. Yet, the majority of patients in both the primary and secondary prevention settings continue to experience significant residual risk for acute cardiovascular events even when their LDL cholesterol is lowered aggressively with combinations of lifestyle modification and pharmacologic intervention. As a result, there is increased focus on targeting and treating low serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in an effort to further reduce risk for cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, unstable angina, ischemic stroke, and death. Epidemiologically high serum levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with reduced risk for the development of atherosclerotic disease. HDL particles are believed to be antiatherogenic secondary to their capacity to drive reverse cholesterol transport and antagonize pathways of inflammation, thrombosis, and oxidation. HDL cholesterol can be quite challenging to raise in many individuals because of the large number of polymorphisms in the genes, enzymes, cell surface receptors, and apoproteins that regulate the serum concentrations, functionality, and patterns of metabolism of HDL particles This article reviews HDL metabolism and established as well as emerging therapeutic approaches to raising serum concentrations of this fascinating and complex lipoprotein.", 
    "52": "An abnormal lipid profile is very frequent in patients with kidney disease due to the well-known nephrotoxicity of lipids. During progression of chronic kidney disease, the excretion of triglycerides, LDL and proteins increases while the glomerular filtration rate declines. Blood lipoproteins and lipids are modulated depending on the type of treatment: hemodialysis, CAPD or renal transplant. We analyzed many studies on dyslipidemia in patients with kidney disease by comparing different therapies. The use of statins reduces protein excretion and hyperlipidemia as well as progression of chronic renal failure with a direct effect on mesangial cell proliferation. A decrease in total cholesterol and LDL occurs in hemodialysis patients, a decrease in LDL and an increase in HDL occur in CAPD patients, and a decrease in LDL and triglycerides is observed in renal transplant recipients; in the latter, graft survival increases without there being any relevant correlation with immunosuppressive treatment. In conclusion, we found that statins are useful to contrast the progression of chronic kidney disease and atherosclerosis in hemodialysis and CAPD patients and to reduce chronic allograft nephropathy in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "53": "Extensive data are available on the safety of atorvastatin from randomised clinical trials, postmarketing analyses and reports to regulatory agencies. Atorvastatin is generally well tolerated across the range of therapeutic dosages, with the exception of a slightly higher rate of liver enzyme elevations with atorvastatin 80 mg/day which does not appear to confer an increased risk of clinically important adverse events. Unlike simvastatin, atorvastatin is associated with a low incidence of muscular toxicity. It is not associated with neurological, cognitive or renal adverse effects and does not require dosage adjustment in patients with renal dysfunction, due to its favourable pharmacokinetic profile, which is unique among the statins. In patients aged > or =65 years, atorvastatin is well tolerated with no dose-dependent increase in adverse events up to the maximum daily dosage of 80 mg/day. Thus, atorvastatin is a safe and well tolerated statin for use in a wide range of patients.", 
    "54": "An association between hypercholesterolaemia and ischaemic stroke has not yet been clearly defined by observational studies. In clinical trials, however, cholesterol-lowering treatments appear to consistently reduce stroke risk. Data are now available from various primary prevention studies - ALLHAT-LLT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack, Lipid-Lowering Therapy), ASCOT-LLA (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, Lipid-Lowering Arm), CARDS (Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study, WOSCOPS (West of Scotland COronary Prevention Study) - and secondary prevention studies - 4S (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study), CARE (Cholesterol and Recurrent Events), GREACE (GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation), HPS (Heart Protection Study), LIPID (Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease), MIRACL (Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering), SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels), TNT (Treating to New Targets) - confirming the ability of statins to reduce stroke risk. Regarding primary prevention, post hoc analyses showed pravastatin reduced the relative risk of stroke by 9-11% (not statistically significant) in the ALLHAT-LLT and WOSCOPS trials, whereas atorvastatin reduced this risk by 27-48% in the ASCOT-LLA (p = 0.024) and CARDS trials. It remains to be established in prospective studies whether cholesterol-lowering is effective in the primary prevention of stroke. Regarding secondary prevention, in five placebo-controlled studies (4S, CARE, HPS, LIPID, MIRACL) involving a total of >40 000 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), statin therapy reduced the relative risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke by 19-50% (p < or = 0.048); the largest decrease was produced by atorvastatin in the MIRACL study (-50%, p = 0.045). In addition, high-dosage atorvastatin reduced stroke risk by 25% (p = 0.02) relative to lower-dosage therapy in the TNT trial, and by 47% (p = 0.034) relative to 'usual' care in the GREACE study. A post hoc analysis of data for 3280 HPS study participants who had had a previous stroke revealed that simvastatin reduced major vascular events by 20% (p = 0.001).The SPARCL study assessed the secondary preventive efficacy of atorvastatin versus placebo in 4731 patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA), but without CHD. Atorvastatin reduced the adjusted relative risk of fatal or nonfatal stroke by 16% (p = 0.03), and that of fatal stroke alone by 43% (p = 0.03). Among secondary study endpoints, atorvastatin reduced the relative risks of stroke and TIA (-23%; p < 0.001), TIA alone (-26%; p = 0.004), and ischaemic stroke (-22%; p = 0.01). Overall, SPARCL study findings suggest that intensive atorvastatin therapy should be started immediately after a stroke or TIA. In summary, atorvastatin has developed a well defined role in the primary and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease, and appears to have a particularly prominent place in preventing such disease in CHD patients, and in the post-stroke and post-TIA setting in patients without CHD.", 
    "55": "Several large-scale clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of atorvastatin in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or metabolic syndrome. In primary prevention, CARDS (Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study) showed that atorvastatin 10 mg/day (vs placebo) reduced relative risk of the composite primary endpoint (acute coronary heart disease [CHD] events, coronary revascularisation, or stroke) by 37% (p = 0.001). This decrease was similar to decreases in major cardiovascular events in the ASCOT-LLA (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid Lowering Arm) trial and HPS (Heart Protection Study). However, in CARDS, atorvastatin efficacy was evident as early as 6 months after starting treatment, whereas in HPS, simvastatin efficacy was noticeable only from about 15-18 months after starting treatment. In the ASCOT-LLA trial, in 2226 hypertensive diabetic patients without previous cardiovascular disease, atorvastatin (vs placebo) reduced the relative risk of all cardiovascular events and procedures by 25% (p = 0.038). In secondary prevention, substudies of the GREACE (GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation), TNT (Treating to New Targets) and PROVE-IT (PRavastatin Or atorVastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy) trials reported results for the approximately 15-25% of study participants who had diabetes. In the GREACE substudy, atorvastatin (vs physicians' standard care) significantly reduced the relative risk of total mortality by 52% (p = 0.049), coronary mortality by 62% (p = 0.042), coronary morbidity by 59% (p < 0.002) and stroke by 68% (p = 0.046). In the TNT substudy, incidence of the primary endpoint was significantly lower in diabetic patients treated with atorvastatin 80 mg/day rather than 10 mg/day (13.8% vs 17.9%; relative risk 0.75; p = 0.026). In the PROVE-IT substudy, a significantly lower incidence of acute cardiac events was reported for atorvastatin versus pravastatin recipients (21.1% vs 26.6%; p = 0.03) and, therefore, an absolute risk reduction of 5.5% was associated with atorvastatin therapy. ASPEN (Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of coronary heart disease Endpoints in Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) - a mixed primary and secondary prevention trial in diabetic patients - found that a 29% lower low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level was seen with atorvastatin than placebo at endpoint (p < 0.0001); however, the reduction in composite primary endpoint of major cardiovascular events (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal major cardiovascular event or stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalisation) with atorvastatin (13.7% vs 15.0% with placebo), and reduction in acute myocardial infarction relative risk of 27% with atorvastatin were not statistically significant. In CHD patients with metabolic syndrome (n = 5584) in a sub-analysis of the TNT trial, intensive versus lower-dosage atorvastatin therapy reduced the relative risk of major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events by 29% (p < 0.0001). The analysis also revealed that CHD patients with, rather than those without, metabolic syndrome had a 44% greater level of absolute cardiovascular risk, thus clearly underscoring the clinical feasibility of administering intensive lipid-lowering therapy to CHD patients with metabolic syndrome. In summary, several patient populations, from definitive, large-scale studies, are now available to corroborate the integral place of atorvastatin--in line with various regional and internationally accepted disease management guidelines--in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome.", 
    "56": "Atorvastatin has been extensively studied in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, and may have some clinical advantages over various other statins in these respects. The principal primary prevention study of atorvastatin, ASCOT-LLA (Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid Lowering Arm), revealed that atorvastatin reduced the relative risk of primary coronary heart disease (CHD) events by 36% (p = 0.0005) compared with placebo in patients with hypertension. Much published data confirm the secondary preventive benefits of atorvastatin in various clinical settings. The IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in End Points Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering) and TNT (Treating to New Targets) trials demonstrate the preventive efficacy of atorvastatin in patients with stable CHD. Relative to simvastatin (in the IDEAL trial) and low-dosage atorvastatin (in the TNT trial), intensive atorvastatin therapy (80 mg/day) reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) by 17-22% (p < or = 0.02). Furthermore, the ALLIANCE (Aggressive Lipid-Lowering Initiation Abates New Cardiac Events) and GREACE (GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation) trials highlight the benefits of atorvastatin in the 'real world' setting in patients with stable CHD. Compared with 'usual' care, atorvastatin reduced the risk of nonfatal MI by 47-59% (p < or = 0.0002).Moreover, the MIRACL (Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering), PROVE-IT (PRavastatin Or atorVastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy) and IDEAL-ACS (Acute Coronary Syndromes) studies outline the benefits of high-dosage atorvastatin therapy started within 24-96 hours, 10 days or 2 months, respectively, of an acute coronary syndrome. Relative to placebo, pravastatin and simvastatin, atorvastatin reduced the risk of death or major cardiovascular events by 16-18% (p < or = 0.048). In patients undergoing revascularisation procedures, the AVERT (Atorvastatin VErsus Revascularisation Treatment) study revealed that 18 months' administration of atorvastatin 80 mg/day was at least as effective as angioplasty plus usual care in reducing the risk of ischaemic events in low-risk patients with stable coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the ARMYDA (Atorvastatin for Reduction in MYocardial DAmage during angioplasty) and ARMYDA-3 trials showed that 7 days' administration of atorvastatin 40 mg/day before coronary intervention significantly reduced the risks of periprocedural myocardial damage (ARMYDA), postprocedural MI (p = 0.025; ARMYDA) and atrial fibrillation (p = 0.003; ARMYDA-3) versus placebo. In addition, it has been reported that C-reactive protein levels and the combined incidence of cardiovascular events (death, MI and target segment revascularisation during the 6-month follow-up) were significantly higher in coronaropathic patients undergoing non-surgical revascularisation procedures (stent implantation) not receiving statin therapy compared with those treated with atorvastatin (80mg). Overall, therefore, the marked efficacy of atorvastatin in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events underscores the pivotal place that this statin has in general cardiovascular disease management, and suggests even greater potential clinical utility for the drug in some clinical settings.", 
    "57": "Molecular differences among the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) give rise to some important differences in their properties, including their anti-atherogenic and anti-inflammatory actions (among the so-called pleiotropic effects) - differences that may help to account for variation in clinical efficacy and safety among the available drugs of this class. The question of whether the clinical benefit of statins such as atorvastatin in reducing cardiovascular events in individuals with elevated cholesterol levels results from direct anti-atherogenic effects in addition to cholesterol-lowering-dependent effects cannot be conclusively answered at present. However, the available evidence suggests that these actions should be considered further, especially in some clinical situations such as acute coronary syndrome where an anti-inflammatory effect could conceivably have a greater role. In the case of atorvastatin, various direct anti-atherogenic effects have been demonstrated. These effects include modification of endothelial dysfunction, inflammatory processes and lipid oxidation, and a possible direct effect on the composition of atheromatous plaques, which together may have a positive influence on the development of atherosclerosis and its subsequent progression (e.g. on the reduction of carotid intima media thickness and regression of atheromas noted in studies with intensive atorvastatin therapy [80 mg/day]). In terms of its effects on endothelial function, improvements in flow-mediated endothelium-dependent vasodilatation have been observed as early as 2 weeks after starting atorvastatin treatment. This effect does not appear to be quantitatively correlated with lowering of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) as greater improvements in endothelial function versus ezetimibe/simvastatin have been noted with atorvastatin despite comparable reductions in LDL-C. Atorvastatin has also been shown to reduce levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein; in comparative studies, this effect proved to be superior to that of simvastatin or pravastatin and equivalent to that of rosuvastatin. In other studies, atorvastatin has been found to inhibit the in vitro oxidation of LDL - an effect that appears to be due mainly its active hydroxy metabolite - and to reduce various oxidative stress markers in hypercholesterolaemic patients. In addition, there is evidence that atorvastatin is able to modify the composition of atherosclerotic plaques and their inflammatory status via a series of effects, mostly involving tissue factors.", 
    "58": "By inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the statins reduce hepatocyte cholesterol levels, which results in up-regulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and, consequently, increased clearance of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) from the plasma. Structural differences among the available statins partially account for differences in their capacity to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and their lipid-lowering efficacy, and for variability in other biological properties, such as their pharmacokinetic characteristics and their tolerability and propensity to interact with other drugs. In terms of pharmacokinetic properties, the synthetic (type II) HMG-CoA analogue atorvastatin exhibits a number of characteristics that are different to those of other members of the class, including a longer plasma half-life and metabolites that have an ability to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase equivalent to that of the parent drug. These characteristics are postulated to be responsible for a more prolonged inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, and, hence, for the greater efficacy of atorvastatin in decreasing total and LDL-C levels relative to other statins (with the exception of rosuvastatin) noted in clinical trials in patients with dyslipidaemias. From the available clinical trial data, atorvastatin can be considered one of the most effective statins, not only by taking into account its effects on LDL-C and ability to meet recommended treatment guidelines for this parameter, but also its effect on triglyceride levels and capacity to modify lipoprotein composition in a non-atherogenic manner. Clinical studies with atorvastatin have also shed some light on the question as to whether it is better to focus on obtaining maximal reduction of LDL-C in at-risk patients or on cardiovascular outcomes. Cardiovascular event rates have been shown to be substantially lower in patients attaining LDL-C levels between 1.0 and 1.6 mmol/L (40-60 mg/dL) or < or =1.0 mmol/L (< or =40 mg/dL) compared with higher levels (>2.1-2.6 mmol/L [>80-100 mg/dL]). This finding reinforces the update of the National Cholesterol Education Programme's clinical practice guidelines, which recommend LDL-C levels <2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) to be the goal of antihyperlipidaemic drug therapy in high-risk patients with CHD, with an optional therapeutic target of <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in patients at very high risk.", 
    "59": "Recent studies demonstrated that inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (HMG-CoAR), called \"statins\", independently of their well known plasma cholesterol lowering effect, exert favourable influence on a diverse range of physiologic processes including endothelial function, oxidant stress and antitumor effect. A number of epidemiological studies demonstrated that statins may have protective effect against cancer. The role of statins in the prevention and therapy of Barrett's adenocarcinoma (BA) has not been investigated so far. The aim of the present study was to analyze: 1) the impact of HMG-CoAR inhibitor, simvastatin, on human BA cell growth and 2) effect of simvastatin on apoptosis related proteins Bax/Bcl-2 and cyclooxygenase-2. BA cells (OE-19 cells) were incubated with simvastatin (1-30 microM). MTT assay was used to determine the antiproliferative effects. The expression of COX-2, Bax and Bcl-2 was analyzed at mRNA and protein level by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot. MTT assay demonstrated a significant dose-dependent inhibition of OE-19 cell growth by simvastatin, which also caused a significant reduction in Bcl-2 expression and an increase in Bax expression. In OE-19 cells, the COX-2 expression was detected and significantly increased by the addition of TNFalpha into the medium, however, this effect was significantly attenuated by simvastatin. Our in vitro data demonstrate that statins possess anticancerogenic properties possibly due to the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of COX-2. Clinical trial are necessary to prove the beneficial effects of statins on cancerogenesis in Barrett's esophagus.", 
    "60": "There are multiple factors for the etiology of atrial fibrillation (AF), including stretch, autonomic imbalance, hyperthyroidism, and inflammation. Of these factors for AF, stretch and inflammation increase the angiotensin II level, thereby inducing calcium over load, and inducing ectopic focal activities that initiate AF. Angiotensin II activates the Erk cascade through the AT(1)R and induces interstitial fibrosis of the atria, which compromises intra-atrial conduction. Short atrial refractoriness and slow conduction form multiple re-entry, before maintaining AF. Anti-arrhythmic drugs used for downstream therapy can suppress the focal activities and re-entry, but cannot prevent the development of a structural substrate. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker and statins might constitute upstream therapy through the prevention of structural remodeling that promotes AF.",

    "62": "In the prophylactic protocol, simvastatin dose-dependently suppressed the decrease in body weight and inflammatory grade of TNBS-treated mice. In contrast, in the therapeutic protocol, no significant difference in body weight reduction was observed between simvastatin-treated and control mice. IFN-gamma release from LP cells was significantly suppressed in mice receiving high-dose simvastatin in the prophylactic protocol. In contrast to TNBS colitis, even high-dose prophylactic simvastatin had no suppressive effects on either weight reduction or the inflammatory grade in OXA colitis.", 
    "63": "Our results indicate that simvastatin negatively regulates inflammation in TNBS-induced colitis, but not in OXA-induced colitis. In TNBS-induced colitis, simvastatin suppressed the Th1-polarized immune response.

    "65": "A total of 226 consecutive patients who underwent successful primary angioplasty for a first AMI were studied. Reperfusion arrhythmias were defined as all arrhythmias that occurred within 2 h after successful primary angioplasty. The reperfusion arrhythmia was found in 130 of 226 patients. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between the patients with and without statin pretreatment. However, the 41 patients receiving statin treatment before admission had lower incidence of the reperfusion arrhythmia than those without it (19.5% and 65.9%, P < 0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that absence of statin pre-treatment was a significant predictor of the reperfusion arrhythmia along with absence of pre-infarction angina and inferior AMI.", 
    "66": "Pre-treatment with statin could reduce the reperfusion arrhythmias after acute myocardial infarction in human.", 
    "67": "Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) exhibit beneficial effects on the vasculature independently of their cholesterol-lowering properties. These pleiotropic effects underlie the ability of statins to reduce intimal hyperplasia in saphenous vein (SV) bypass grafts by attenuating smooth muscle cell (SMC) invasion and proliferation. Although all statins can effectively lower cholesterol, the pleiotropic effects of individual statins may well differ. We therefore compared the concentration-dependent effects of 4 lipophilic statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and lovastatin) and 1 hydrophilic statin (pravastatin) on the proliferation and invasion of SMC cultured from SV of 9 different patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The lipophilic statins inhibited SV-SMC proliferation over a 4-day period with an order of potency of fluvastatin > atorvastatin > simvastatin > lovastatin (IC50 range = 0.07 to 1.77 microM). Similarly, these statins also inhibited SV-SMC invasion through an artificial basement membrane barrier (fluvastatin > atorvastatin > simvastatin > lovastatin; IC50 range = 0.92 to 26.9 microM). In contrast, the hydrophilic pravastatin had no significant effect on SV-SMC proliferation at concentrations up to 10 microM, nor did it attenuate SV-SMC invasion (up to 30 microM). Our data provide strong evidence that individual statins possess differential pleiotropic effects on SV-SMC function. This may be of clinical relevance in the selection of individual statins for the treatment of CABG patients.", 
    "68": "Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a complex phenomenon that might be caused by a deficiency of nitric oxide (NO) and an overproduction of peroxynitrite (ONOO-). This study used a nanotechnological approach to monitor the in vitro effect of statins on the [NO]/[ONOO-] balance in normal and dysfunctional endothelial cells. NO and (ONOO-) were measured by electrochemical nanosensors in a single human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) treated with atorvastatin or simvastatin for 24 hours in the presence or absence of 50 microg/mL oxidized-LDL. An imbalance between [NO]/[ONOO-] concentrations was used as an indicator of endothelial dysfunction and correlated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. Ox-LDL induced dysfunction of the endothelium by uncoupling eNOS. NO concentration decreased from 300 +/- 12 to 146 +/- 8 nmol/L and (ONOO-) increased from 200 +/- 9 to 360 +/- 13 nmol/L. The [NO]/[ONOO-] balance decreased from 1.50 +/- 0.04 (control) to 0.40 +/- 0.03 for cells co-incubated with ox-LDL. Treatment with statins reversed eNOS uncoupling, induced by oxidized-LDL and significantly increased the [NO]/[ONOO-] balance to 1.2 +/- 0.1. These results demonstrate that statins can restore endothelial function by increasing eNOS expression, decreasing eNOS uncoupling, reducing the (ONOO-) level (nitroxidative stress), and shifting the [NO]/[ONOO-] balance towards NO.", 
    "69": "The combined effect of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor on vascular lesion formation in the insulin-resistant state has not been examined. We tested whether or not combined treatment is superior to single-drug treatment for inhibiting vascular lesion formation in insulin-resistant rats. The rats were maintained on a fructose-rich diet for 4 weeks and then treated with olmesartan (1 mg/kg/day) and/or pravastatin (10 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. After 1 week of drug treatment, balloon injury of the carotid arteries was performed. Two weeks later, the injured arteries were harvested for morphometry and immunostaining. Olmesartan and pravastatin each modestly attenuated neointimal formation without significant changes in blood pressure or serum lipid levels. The combination of olmesartan and pravastatin significantly suppressed the neointimal formation compared with either monotherapy. The number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells was increased by olmesartan but not by pravastatin. Olmesartan and pravastatin each decreased the number of Ki-67-positive cells, which indicates cell proliferation, to the same extent. The combined treatment increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells but did not affect the number of Ki-67-positive cells. The combined treatment decreased the insulin level and increased the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells. These results suggest that the combination of olmesartan and pravastatin is beneficial for the treatment of vascular diseases in the insulin-resistant state independently of blood pressure or cholesterol levels.", 
    "70": "In the recent years, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A(HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have emerged as the most important class of lipid-lowering agents. Through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, they restrict the rate-limiting step of cholesterol synthesis resulting in up-regulation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) receptors on the cell membrane and reduction of atherogenic LDL consequences. The wide spectrum of non-lipid-mediated pleiotropic effects of statins includes: improvement of endothelial dysfunction, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant effects, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques and inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy. Several clinical trials have demonstrated and confirmed these beneficial effects of statins in cardiovascular disorders, in primary and secondary prevention settings. Recent studies have reported that the physiological background of the widespread therapeutic efficacy of HMG-CoAreductase inhibitors involved various mechanisms, partially associated with statin impact on posttranslational modifications (e.g. prenylation process). In this review, we have focused on some of them, especially including the statin impact on the endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, peroxisome poliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), beta-adrenergic signaling, renin-angiotensin system and their possible mutual mechanistic linkage.", 
    "71": "Guidelines stress the importance of the simultaneous management of multiple cardiovascular risk factors. This can in part be achieved by coadministration of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive treatments. Potential pharmacodynamic interaction between drugs should be investigated as part of developing single-pill combinations. The Respond trial assessed whether combining amlodipine to treat hypertension and atorvastatin to treat dyslipidemia affected the action of either monotherapy. A total of 1660 hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia received 1 of 15 combinations of amlodipine (placebo, 5, or 10 mg) and atorvastatin (placebo, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg) in a 3 x 5 factorial randomized, placebo-controlled design. At 8 weeks, combination-treated patients experienced dose-related and statistically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and Framingham risk score. Overall, coadministered atorvastatin and amlodipine was well tolerated and without adverse pharmacodynamic interaction; combination treatment did not affect the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering efficacy and safety of atorvastatin, or the systolic blood pressure-lowering efficacy and safety of amlodipine.", 
    "72": "Previous studies reported that statin use was associated with a decreased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), whereas no association was found between fibrate use and VTE.

No difference was found for tHcy levels between patients who were current users of statin compared to non users (17.7 micromol/L+/-7.3 in users vs 18.4 micromol/L+/-8.4 in non users, p=0.50). In contrast, fibrate users had a significant higher mean level of tHcy than non users (23.2 micromol/L+/-8.7 in users vs 18.4 micromol/L+/-8.4 in non users, p<0.0001). Nevertheless, adjustment on tHcy level did not alter significance and strength of the association between fibrates and VTE (1.66, CI 95% 1.07-2.59).",

    "76": "Anti-inflammatory strategies have attracted much interest for their potential to prevent further deterioration of Parkinson's disease. Recent experimental and clinical evidence indicate that statins - extensively used in medical practice as effective lipid-lowering agents - have also anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we investigated the influence of simvastatin on the degenerative process of the dopaminergic neurons of the rat following intranigral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inductor of inflammation that we have previously used as an animal model of Parkinson's disease. We evaluated TH positive neurons, astroglial, and microglial populations and found that simvastatin prevented the inflammatory processes, as the induction of interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and iNOS and the consequent dopaminergic degeneration induced by LPS. Moreover, simvastatin produced the activation of the neurotrophic factor BDNF, along with the prevention of the oxidative damage to proteins. Moreover, it also prevents the main changes produced by LPS on different mitogen-activated protein kinases, featured as increases of P-c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase, P-extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p-38, and P-glycogen synthase kinase and the decrease of the promotion of cell survival signals such as cAMP response element-binding protein and Akt. Our results suggest that statins could delay the progression of dopaminergic degeneration in disorders involving inflammatory processes.", 
    "77": "Atorvastatin is a lipid-lowering agent that has been evaluated in a number of primary and secondary intervention studies. In the primary prevention trials ASCOT-LLA and CARDS, atorvastatin 10 mg/day significantly reduced cardiovascular events compared with placebo. A prospectively conducted economic analysis of the 3.3-year ASCOT-LLA trial showed that atorvastatin was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of euro11,693 (UK) and euro12,673 (Sweden) per event avoided (2002 values). Longer-term modelled analyses using data from CARDS showed ICERs of euro8046 (Spain) and 6471pound (UK) per QALY gained (2003/2004 values), and a US analysis showed atorvastatin was dominant versus no statin when modelled over the lifetime of a representative US diabetic primary prevention population. In a modelled analysis based on results of the IDEAL trial, which showed significant reductions in cardiovascular endpoints with high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg/day) compared with conventional-dose simvastatin in patients with stable coronary heart disease, ICER values were below the commonly used cost-effectiveness threshold of euro50,000 per QALY gained in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, but were above this threshold in Finland (2005 values). A modelled US analysis that also included data from IDEAL and other sources showed an ICER of $US33,400 per QALY gained, assuming the incremental difference in acquisition cost between high-dose atorvastatin and conventional-dose simvastatin was $US1.40/day (2005 value). Most cost-effectiveness analyses with atorvastatin in patients with acute coronary syndrome used data from the 16-week MIRACL study, which showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events with high-dose atorvastatin compared with placebo. Analyses were conducted in North America and Europe and showed that 31-86% of the acquisition cost of high-dose atorvastatin was offset by reductions in costs associated with cardiovascular events. Across five countries, ICER values ranged from approximate $US850 to $US4100 per event avoided (2000/2001 values). Another analysis conducted in the US used longer-term data and showed that high-dose atorvastatin versus conventional-dose statin was associated with an ICER of $US12,900 per QALY gained, assuming the daily difference in acquisition cost was $US1.40 (2005 value). In conclusion, atorvastatin has demonstrated beneficial effects on various cardiovascular endpoints in large, well designed primary and secondary intervention trials. These benefits in moderate- to high-risk patients were achieved at a relatively low incremental cost and, across the economic analyses, a substantial proportion of atorvastatin acquisition costs was offset by reductions in healthcare resource use associated with cardiovascular events. Cost-effectiveness analyses based on major clinical trials comparing atorvastatin with placebo, usual medical care, simvastatin or pravastatin have generally shown that atorvastatin is associated with favourable ICER values, often well below commonly used cost-effectiveness thresholds. These modelled analyses have the inherent limitation that projecting long-term outcomes beyond the time period of a clinical trial imparts a degree of uncertainty to the results. Nevertheless, while some findings were sensitive to changes in model assumptions, such as the long-term benefits of statin therapy, most sensitivity analyses showed that results of the base-case analyses were robust to plausible changes in key parameters. Although a clear pattern is not evident from available data, intuitively, the value of atorvastatin would be expected to increase with the patient's risk for serious cardiovascular events.", 
    "78": "Monascus species-fermented red mold rice (RMR) has been regarded as a popular hypolipidemic functional food because it contains monacolin K, an inhibitor of de novo cholesterol synthesis. However, the safety of RMR is always an issue because citrinin is present in RMR and is reported to be hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic. The present study was therefore to develop a postprocess to remove citrinin yet retain monacoln K in the RMR preparation. We found that phosphate-ethanol extraction was effective for the removal citrinin, yet it could retain monacolin K, because the former was more hydrophilic than the latter in phosphate-ethanol solution. Ethanol, phosphate, and extraction time were optimized as factors of response surface methodology (RSM). It was found that the optimal RSM condition was 45% ethanol, 1.5% phosphate, and extraction for 70 min. Under this optimal condition, 91.6% citrinin was removed and 79.5% monacolin K was retained in the final RMR.", 
    "79": "Numerous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and observational studies have demonstrated that statins decrease mortality and major cardiovascular events in older high-risk persons with hypercholesterolemia. The Heart Protection Study found that statins decreased mortality and major cardiovascular events in high-risk persons regardless of the initial level of serum lipids, age, or gender. The updated National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) III guidelines state that in very high-risk patients, a serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of < 70 mg/dl is a reasonable clinical strategy, regardless of age. When a high-risk person has hypertriglyceridemia or low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, consideration can be given to combining a fibrate or nicotinic acid with an LDL cholesterol-lowering drug. For moderately high-risk persons (2 or more risk factors and a 10-year risk for coronary heart disease of 10% to 20%), the serum LDL cholesterol should be decreased to < 100 mg/dl. When LDL cholesterol-lowering drug therapy is used to treat high-risk persons or moderately high-risk persons, the serum LDL cholesterol should be decreased at least 30% to 40%.",

Pathogenic mechanisms include effects of the virus itself, effects of the antiretroviral drugs on key metabolic pathways, and drug-associated adipose repartitioning with subsequent development of insulin resistance and associated metabolic derangements. Diagnostic methods include a fasting lipoprotein profile and assessment of secondary factors. Treatment strategies include non-pharmacological approaches such as changes to diet and lifestyle, as well as switching to a less metabolically active antiretroviral regimen without compromising antiretroviral efficacy. Pharmacological treatment may include statin drugs, fibrates, niacin, or cholesterol absorption inhibitors, in addition to management of comorbidities such as increased global cardiometabolic risk and insulin resistance.",

We hypothesized that statin inhibits early atherosclerotic change in common carotid artery (CCA), and investigated its effect on lectin-like oxidized-LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression, both of which are early atherosclerotic markers. Stroke-prone spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) of 8 weeks old were orally treated with vehicle or simvastatin (20mg/kg) daily. After 4 weeks of simvastatin or vehicle treatment, or 2 weeks of vehicle and 2 weeks of simvastatin treatment, CCA was removed. LOX-1 and MCP-1 expression as well as macrophage infiltration were histologically investigated. Lipid deposition was also investigated by Sudan III staining. Simvastatin groups showed significantly smaller amount of lipid deposition and LOX-1 and MCP-1 expression, independent of serum lipid levels. Macrophage infiltration was also decreased. Reduction of cerebrovascular events by statins may be brought by the direct inhibition of atherosclerotic change.",

Statins are hypolipemic drugs that are effective in the reduction of cholesterol serum levels, attenuating cholesterol synthesis in liver by competitive inhibition regarding the substrate or molecular target HMG-CoA reductase. We have herewith used computer-aided molecular design tools, i.e., flexible docking, virtual screening in large data bases, molecular interaction fields to propose novel potential HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are promising for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.",

The appropriateness of statin application to patients with chronic cardiac insufficiency (CCI) is still under discussion, because there are no sufficient data on whether hypolipidemic therapy is able to improve the prognosis in this category of patients. The authors conducted a long-term research into the use of statins in combination with basic combined therapy in patients with CCI complicating the course of CAD. A reverse correlation between the levels of total cholesterol, low-density protein cholesterol, and the degree of CCI severity was demonstrated. Long-term continuous therapy of CCI patients with a combination of medications including statins did not worsen the clinical symptoms.

Renal inflammation, involving cytokine/adhesion molecule cascades with recruitment, activation, and diapedesis of circulating leukocytes is also implicated. Clinically, renal I-R occurs in a variety of medical and surgical settings and is responsible for the development of acute tubular necrosis (a characteristic feature of ischemic ARF), e.g., in renal transplantation where I-R of the kidney directly influences graft and patient survival. The cellular mechanisms involved in the development of renal I-R injury have been targeted by several pharmacological interventions. However, although showing promise in experimental models of renal I-R injury and ischemic ARF, they have not proved successful in the clinical setting (e.g., atrial natriuretic peptide, low-dose dopamine). This review highlights recent pharmacological developments, which have shown particular promise against experimental renal I-R injury and ischemic ARF, including novel antioxidants and antioxidant enzyme mimetics, nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, erythropoietin, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor agonists, inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, carbon monoxide-releasing molecules, statins, and adenosine.

After 12 months, the mean reduction of LDL-C was 34% in the atorvastatin group and 0% in the usual care group (p<0.01). The mean absolute plaque volume showed a larger increase in the usual care group than in the atorvastatin group (atorvastatin -1.4+/-11.6 mm3, usual care 7.6+/-10.3 mm3; p<0.01). Vessel volume also showed a larger increase in the usual care group than in the atorvastatin group (atorvastatin 2.2+/-10.9 mm3, usual care 10.9+/-17.7 mm3; p=0.03).",

Of these, 13,812 patients were followed up and included in the analysis: 10,626 (77%) men and 3,186 (23%) women. Diagnosis at the time of registration was acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for 2,955 patients, old myocardial infarction for 3,913 patients and unstable angina pectoris for 2,049 patients. Patients were followed up for an average of 2.7 years. At the start of the follow-up, 37.4% of the patients were prescribed statins, 50.2% calcium-channel blockers (CCB), 31.6% angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), 13.5% angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and 60.2% nitrates.

The pathogenesis of mevalonic aciduria is not clear, although the cause is known - a genetic defect leading to a deficiency in mevalonate kinase activity. The lack of non-steroid isoprenoids in patients with mevalonic aciduria might cause oxidative stress due to a decreased production of endogenous antioxidants including ubiquinone 10, selenoproteins and glutathione peroxidase. The Moosmann-Behl hypothesis of statin-induced muscular and neuronal damage mediated by oxidative stress might explain at least partially the pathogenesis of mevalonic aciduria. Studies focusing on the role of oxidative stress in patients suffering from disorders in cholesterol biosynthesis are needed to support adjuvant antioxidative treatment.",

By FACS analysis of freshly isolated PBMNCs, KDR (+) cells increased after simvastatin treatment while there were no differences in CD34, AC133, and VE-cadherin. Also, serum concentration of IL-8 was markedly increased, while VEGF was only slightly increased. In vitro, PBMNCs co-cultured with simvastatin showed increased cluster formation at day 7, and simvastatin facilitated the appearance and networking of EPCs compared with vehicle. Simvastatin-co-cultured PBMNCs showed significantly increased KDR (+) cells, in contrast to CD34, CD31, and VE-Cadherin (+) cells. In response to simvastatin, IL-8 was mainly increased in monocyte culture supernatants while VEGF increased in smooth muscle cell culture supernatants. These cytokines were associated with increased EPC migratory function. The increase in IL-8 secretion from monocytes by statin treatment was associated with phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK3beta, which was reversed by constitutive activation of GSK-3beta.",

The levels of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and lung tissues increased in CPB groups, whereas pretreatment with simvastatins reduced these inflammatory marks in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01, versus control group). Furthermore, pretreatment with simvastatin had a lower lung injury score (p < 0.05, versus control group).",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) modulates the nitric oxide (NO) production via inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in preadipocytes. Undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells, a model of preadipocytes, significantly produced NO by the treatment with the combination of lipopolysaccharide (L), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (T) and interferon-gamma (I). Pre-incubation with simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, or pravastatin, a hydrophilic one, dose-dependently inhibited the NO production in the LTI-treated cells. The effect of simvastatin was offset by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) but not by squalene. The mRNA level for iNOS paralleled the NO production. The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was activated by the LTI-treatment, and was inhibited by addition of simvastatin or pravastatin. Mevalonate or GGPP completely offset the effect of simvastatin. Simvastatin or pravastatin also decreased the LTI-stimulated interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion. These effects of pravastatin were relatively weak compared with those of simvastatin. Y27632, an inhibitor of Rho kinase, also inhibited the LTI-induced NF-kappaB activation and iNOS expression, and decreased the production of NO and IL-6 in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. These results suggest that statins, especially lipophilic types, inhibit induction of iNOS by inhibiting the small GTP-binding protein signal in preadipocytes.", 
    "151": "We recently found that simvastatin can modulate the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation pathway, but whether other statins have similar effects to those of simvastatin is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the effect six different statins on TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation in human myeloid leukemia cells. We then determined whether the combination of statins and standard chemotherapeutic agents could overcome chemoresistance and augment apoptosis. Of the six statins evaluated, only the natural statins (simvastatin, mevastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin), not the synthetic statins (fluvastatin and atorvastatin), inhibited TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation. Simvastatin suppressed the NF-kappaB activation and potentiated the apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and 5-fluorouracil. These results suggest that different statins behave differently from one another and that they may be useful in overcoming chemoresistance.",

A total of 17,802 persons with LDL cholesterol<130 mg/dl (3.36 mmol/L) and hs-CRP>or=2 mg/L were recruited from 26 countries and randomly allocated to 20 mg/day rosuvastatin or placebo. In contrast to previous studies of statin therapy in primary prevention, JUPITER is evaluating a group with modest plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol (median 108 mg/dl, interquartile range 94 to 119). Further, the trial includes 6,801 women (38.2%) and 5,577 participants with metabolic syndrome (32.1%). Thus, in addition to broadening our understanding of statin therapy and inflammation, the JUPITER trial will provide important and clinically relevant information on primary prevention among patients who do not currently qualify for lipid-lowering therapy. In conclusion, as 20 mg of rosuvastatin can reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 50%, JUPITER will also provide crucial safety data for several thousand patients who should achieve LDL cholesterol levels<50 mg/dl on a long-term basis.", 
    "158": "Despite significant progress in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major public health problem. Statins showed consistent benefits on cardiovascular events, but scant data were available about their effects on SCD. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of statins on SCD. Additional analyses were carried out to evaluate lipid reduction as a possible mediator of the effect. Randomized controlled trials from January 1966 to July 2006 were retrieved by searching the MEDLINE database. Inclusion criteria were outcome focusing on the incidence of SCD, statin treatment compared with placebo or no treatment, randomized design, >or=100 patients enrolled, and follow-up>or=6 months. Data were independently abstracted by 2 investigators using a standardized protocol. Ten randomized controlled trials enrolling a total of 22,275 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Risks of SCD were 3% in patients receiving statins and 3.8% in control patients. Statin treatment was associated with a significant 19% risk reduction for SCD (odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.93, p=0.003). In subgroup analysis, the benefit of statins was independent from the main characteristics of the studies and changes in patient lipid levels during the study. In conclusion, our results suggest that statins decrease the risk of SCD.", 
    "159": "In this study we examined the effect of the statin atorvastatin on the Akt/GSK-3beta pathway. Our findings indicate that atorvastatin treatment for 15 days inhibited pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and prevented nuclear translocation of GATA4 and c-Jun and AP-1 DNA-binding activity. In addition, atorvastatin treatment prevented the increase in the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta caused by cardiac hypertrophy, and this effect correlated with an increase in protein levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN), which negatively regulates the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathway. To test whether the inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on Akt and GSK-3beta phosphorylation was direct we performed in vitro studies using embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells, human AC16 cardiomyoblasts and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Preincubation of cells with atorvastatin prevented Akt/GSK-3beta phosphorylation by different hypertrophic stimuli without affecting PTEN protein levels. However, atorvastatin prevented endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and PTEN oxidation, a process that correlates with its inactivation, suggesting that atorvastatin prevents ROS-induced PTEN inactivation in acute treatments. These findings point to a new potential anti-hypertrophic effect of statins, which can prevent activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta hypertrophic pathway by modulating PTEN activation by different mechanisms in chronic and acute treatments.", 
    "160": "Pleiotropic mechanisms beyond their cholesterol lowering effect of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins such as pravastatin are known. We used a temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model in 114 Wistar rats to assess i) whether repeated injections of various doses of pravastatin (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) at 30 min, 6 h, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days after stroke onset are neuroprotective, ii) whether attenuation of striatal glutamate and interleukin-6 (IL-6) release is part of the neuroprotective mechanism, and iii) how local cerebral blood flow (CBF) is influenced by pravastatin both in the acute and late stage of ischemia. Animals were sacrificed 5 days after MCAO, infarct size was analyzed with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. As compared to saline (139+/-14 mm3, n=11), higher doses of pravastatin beyond 0.1 mg/kg significantly reduced infarct size with the greatest effect obtained with 1 mg/kg (60+/-14 mm3, n=11, P=0.0004). Using cerebral microdialyis in this dose group, we demonstrated that striatal glutamate increase in the ischemic hemisphere was attenuated by pravastatin compared to placebo. Likewise, IL-6 release was diminished at 2 h, but not at 6 h after tMCAO. Improvement of local CBF by pravastatin was observed at day 5, but not at 5 h after tMCAO, thus representing a more long term effect of pravastatin. In conclusion, a relatively high dose of pravastatin administered repetitively after stroke onset improved neurological outcome through various cholesterol-independent mechanisms.",

The authors report a case of 74 years old patient with severe lower gastrointestinal bleeding. She was in antiplatelet treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg/die) and clopidogrel (75 mg/die) for preventing the restenosis of medicated stents positioned to treat an acute coronary syndrome. At the same time the patient was under treatment for primary hypercholesterolemia with rosuvastatin (20 mg/die). The severe haemorrhage demanded haemodynamic stabilization, achieved by colloid infusion and blood transfusions. The bleeding continued; selective arteriography showed it's origin from the areas of the sigmoid and superior hemorrhoidal arteries. During the procedure, embolization of the inferior mesenteric artery using spiral type BALT was performed, with consequent bleeding interruption. Fifteen days after the embolization, a rectosigmoid colonoscopy showed a sigmoid diverticular disease. The treatment with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel has surely contributed to the severity of the hemorrhage.

    "178": "Lung cancer causes over one million deaths per year worldwide and cigarette smoking, the proximate cause, results in a field cancerization of the respiratory track. Lung cancer cells or premalignant cells may be susceptible to apoptosis or necrosis-inducing agents. Statins inhibit the acetyl coenzyme A pathway reducing L-mevalonate that is a precursor to isoprenoids necessary for post-translational processing, resulting in apoptosis. Lovastatin was added to four lung cancer cell lines and normal human bronchial epithelial cells followed by Western blots to evaluate proteins in the cell cycle, oxidant, and apoptotic pathways. Flow cytometry revealed significant increases in three of four lung cancer cell lines in apoptosis and necrosis after lovastatin treatment at 10 microM for 72 h. Lovastatin adversely affected lung cancer cell survival with increases in cell-cycle check-point inhibitors p21WAF and/or p27KIP and a decrease in cyclin D1. All four lung cancer cell lines had a decrease in glutathione after lovastatin treatment consistent with reduced protection against reactive oxidant species. Three of four lung cancer cell lines had increased cytochrome c release with reduced pro-caspase-3 and increases in activated caspase-3. Lovastatin induces apoptosis and necrosis in lung cancer cell lines by causing alterations in the cell cycle, reducing glutathione, and activating p53, Bax protein, and caspases while increasing cytochrome c in apoptosis pathways. Targeting HMG-CoA reductase may represent an approach to lung cancer chemotherapy, e.g., reversing ground glass opacities detected on CT scans or resolving airway preneoplasias detected by bronchoscopy before they progress to malignant transformation.", 
    "179": "Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition leads to changes in lipoprotein metabolism. We studied the effect of the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib on VLDL apolipoprotein E (apoE) metabolism. Subjects, pretreated with atorvastatin (n = 9) or untreated (n = 10), received placebo followed by torcetrapib (4 weeks each). After each treatment, subjects underwent a primed-constant infusion of D(3)-leucine to determine the VLDL apoE production rate (PR) and fractional catabolic rate (FCR). Torcetrapib alone reduced the VLDL apoE pool size (PS) (-28%) by increasing the VLDL apoE FCR (77%) and leaving the VLDL apoE PR unchanged. In subjects pretreated with atorvastatin, torcetrapib increased the VLDL apoE FCR (25%) and PR (21%). This left the VLDL apoE PS unchanged but increased the VLDL apoE content, likely enhancing VLDL clearance and reducing LDL production in this group. Used alone, torcetrapib reduces the VLDL apoE PS by increasing the apoE FCR while leaving the VLDL apoE content unchanged. In contrast, torcetrapib added to atorvastatin treatment increases both the VLDL apoE FCR and PR, leaving the VLDL apoE PS unchanged. Adding torcetrapib to atorvastatin treatment increases the VLDL apoE content, likely leading to decreased conversion of VLDL to LDL, reduced LDL production, and lower levels of circulating VLDL and LDL.", 
    "180": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has gained attention as a key regulator of serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. This novel protease causes the degradation of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptors. In humans, gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 cause a form of familial hypercholesterolemia, whereas loss-of-function mutations result in significantly decreased LDL-C levels and cardiovascular risk. Previous studies have demonstrated that statins upregulate PCSK9 mRNA expression in cultured cells and animal models. In light of these observations, we studied the effect of atorvastatin on circulating PCSK9 protein levels in humans using a sandwich ELISA to quantitate serum PCSK9 levels in patients treated with atorvastatin or placebo for 16 weeks. We observed that atorvastatin (40 mg/day) significantly increased circulating PCSK9 levels by 34% compared with baseline and placebo and decreased LDL-C levels by 42%. These results suggest that the addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor to statin therapy may result in even further LDL-C decreases.", 
    "181": "The cholesterol-lowering agents known as statins have in vitro activities against human pathogenic fungi, such as Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Zygomycetes. Synergy between statins and azoles against these fungi has also been reported. We evaluated the in vitro activities of two statins, lovastatin and simvastatin, alone and in combination with azoles and amphotericin B, against clinical isolates of Aspergillus spp. A disk diffusion assay showed that both statins were active against Aspergillus spp. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges for lovastatin and simvastatin against Aspergillus spp. were 16 to >256 microg/ml and 4 to >256 microg/ml, respectively. Although both statins were fungicidal for A. fumigatus, the MICs were vastly higher than clinically achievable concentrations. The results of a combined agar dilution-Epsilometer test as well as a disk diffusion assay showed that neither statin had any effect on the in vitro activities of itraconazole, voriconazole, or amphotericin B against Aspergillus spp.", 
    "182": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and statins have renoprotective effects. We studied the cellular mechanisms for this effect in adriamycin-treated mice receiving captopril, losartan, simvastatin, or their combinations. The mice developed albuminuria, renal insufficiency, and parenchymal inflammation/fibrosis accompanied by overexpression of intrarenal converting enzyme and angiotensin II. Only captopril consistently improved these abnormalities and reduced the cortical expression of several proinflammatory and profibrotic factors including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). These effects were independent of blood pressure, accompanied by increased urine N-acetylseryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) levels, and the restoration of renal angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II to baseline levels. Losartan or simvastatin alone or together had no effect, and their addition to captopril did not enhance protection. In vitro, angiotensin II stimulated TGF-beta in renal tubular cells via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Captopril or Ac-SDKP suppressed angiotensin II-induced MAPK activation and TGF-beta secretion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition confers renoprotection in adriamycin nephropathy by reducing intrarenal angiotensin II and augmenting Ac-SDKP expression that together attenuate MAPK signaling and its downstream proinflammatory and fibrogenic properties. The addition of receptor blocker and/or statin failed to potentiate such effects.", 
    "183": "The flavonoid quercetin 3-glucoside (Q3G) protected SH-SY5Y, HEK293, and MCF-7 cells against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. cDNA microarray studies suggested that Q3G-pretreated cells subjected to oxidative stress up-regulate the expression of genes associated with lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Q3G pretreatment elevated both the expression and activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) only in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to oxidative stress. Inhibition of SREBP-2 expression by small interfering RNA or small molecule inhibitors of 2,3-oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase or HMG-CoA reductase blocked Q3G-mediated cytoprotection in SH-SY5Y cells. By contrast, Q3G did not protect either HEK293 or MCF-7 cells via this signaling pathway. Moreover, the addition of isopentenyl pyrophosphate rescued SH-SY5Y cells from the inhibitory effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. Last, Q3G pretreatment enhanced the incorporation of [(14)C]acetate into [(14)C]cholesterol in SH-SY5Y cells under oxidative stress. Taken together, these studies suggest a novel mechanism for flavonoid-induced cytoprotection in SH-SY5Y cells involving SREBP-2-mediated sterol synthesis that decreases lipid peroxidation by maintaining membrane integrity in the presence of oxidative stress.", 
    "184": "Inflammation and oxidative stress have been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). On the other hand, accumulating evidence suggests that statins may have antiarrhythmic effects due to pleiotropic properties. However, inconsistent results have been reported with respect to AF.", 
    "185": "We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies to examine the association between statin use and development of AF.", 
    "186": "PubMed, Cochrane clinical trials database, and EMBASE were searched until November 2006. In addition, a manual search was performed using all review articles on this topic, reference lists of papers, and abstracts from conference reports. Of the 309 initially identified studies, 6 RCTs and 10 observational studies with 7041 patients were finally analyzed.", 
    "187": "The analysis of RCTs showed no significant effect of statins on AF development (RR=0.76, 95% CI:0.55-1.05, P=0.09), and significant heterogeneity between individual studies (P=0.0008, I(2)=74.0%). Subgroup analysis revealed that differences in AF detection methodology may be the cause of heterogeneity. The analysis of observational studies demonstrated that statin use reduced the relative risk for AF by 23% (95% CI:0.70-0.85, Z=4.95, P<0.00001) without significant differences between the trials (P=0.08, I(2)=41.2%). This favorable effect was greatest in the post-operative patients (RR=0.61, 95% CI:0.49-0.76, Z=4.30, P<0.0001).", 
    "188": "Our meta-analysis suggests that statins may be effective in AF prevention especially in the post-operative setting. However, there are insufficient data for the widespread use of statins solely for AF prevention. Larger RCTs with long-term follow-up in different clinical settings, and more sensitive methods of arrhythmia detection are needed to clarify the impact of statins on AF."
