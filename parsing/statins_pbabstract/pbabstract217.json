Nevertheless, administration of the highest approved statin dose only offers limited additional benefit at the expense of an increased incidence of side effects. Therefore, novel compounds that further reduce the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and at the same time have beneficial effects on other lipid parameters when added to statin therapy are under investigation. Nicotinic acid lowers the levels of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides while raising the concentration of the protective high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. A significant inverse association exists between long-term intake of omega-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular mortality; these fish oils lower serum triglycerides levels. Fibrates substantially decrease triglycerides, increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and modestly decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Ezetimibe selectively inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut. Combined therapy with ezetimibe and a statin provides an incremental reduction in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.", 
    "6": "Left ventricular (LV) remodelling remains an important treatment target in patients after myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic heart failure (CHF). Accumulating evidence has supported the concept that beneficial effects of current pharmacological treatment strategies to improve the prognosis in these patients, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker therapy, and beta-blocker therapy, are related, at least in part, to their effects on LV remodelling and dysfunction. However, despite modern reperfusion therapy after MI and optimized treatment of patients with CHF, LV remodelling is observed in a substantial proportion of patients and is associated with an adverse clinical outcome. These observations call for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or even reverse cardiac remodelling. Recent insights from experimental studies have provided new targets for interventions to prevent or reverse LV remodelling, i.e. reduced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase-derived NO availability, activation of cardiac and leukocyte-dependent oxidant stress pathways, inflammatory pathway activation, matrix-metalloproteinase activation, or stem cell transfer and delivery of novel paracrine factors. An important challenge in translating these observations from preclinical studies into clinical treatment strategies relates to the fact that clinical studies are designed on top of established pharmacological therapy, whereas most experimental studies have tested novel interventions without concomitant drug regimens such as ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. Therefore, animal studies may overestimate the effect of potential novel treatment strategies on LV remodelling and dysfunction, since established pharmacological therapies may act, in part, via identical or similar signalling pathways. Nevertheless, preclinical studies provide essential information for identifying potential novel targets, and their potential drawbacks, and are required for developing novel clinical treatment strategies to prevent or reverse LV remodelling and dysfunction.",

After 3 months, despite progressive weight gain caused by dietary indiscretion, LDL-C decreased by 24% and TG and TC levels reached goal. Lp(a) levels did not change. Niacin ER titration continued, pravastatin was maximized, and ezetimibe 10 mg daily was started.

Multivariate analyses of variance and multiple regression analyses were used to explore changes in cognitions and thereby better understand trial effects.", 
    "15": "Fifty-nine general medical practitioners and 53 practice nurses (intervention: n = 55, 41.98% of trial participants; control: n = 57, 38.26% of trial participants) completed the questionnaire. There were no differences between groups in mean scores for attitudes, subjective norms, PBC or intentions. Control group clinicians had 'normatively-driven' intentions (i.e., related to subjective norm scores), whereas intervention group clinicians had 'attitudinally-driven' intentions (i.e., related to attitude scores) for foot inspection and statin prescription. After controlling for effects of the three predictor variables, this group difference was significant for foot inspection behaviour (trial group x attitude interaction, beta = 0.72, p < 0.05; trial group x subjective norm interaction, beta = -0.65, p < 0.05).",

This study illustrates the use of theory-based process evaluation to uncover processes underlying change in implementation trials.",

Two trained nurses provided the detailing to prescribers, including specific discussion about the use of statins in this high-risk patient population. Nurses left the prescribers with a summary of clinical practice guidelines, a one-page detailing sheet and a list of patients under the care of the prescriber who were candidates for statins.

    "25": "1. The beneficial effects of pravastatin, beyond that of lowering cholesterol in atherosclerosis, include reducing the action of interferon (IFN)-gamma. Interferon-gamma activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), but it is unclear whether the inhibitory effect of pravastatin in atherosclerosis is via modulation of the IFN-gamma/STAT1 pathway. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the action of pravastatin in preventing aortic atherosclerosis by attenuation of IFN-gamma action is dependent on STAT1. 2. Male apolipoprotein E-knockout (apoE(-/-)) mice were fed a diet containing 1.25% cholesterol (w/w). Mice were divided into two groups, one of which was supplemented with pravastatin (80 mg/kg per day). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a normal diet and served as the control group (n = 12 per group). 3. Atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root were assessed by staining sections haematoxylin and eosin. Serum concentrations of IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma mRNA expression in the thoracoabdominal aorta were determined by ELISA and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods, respectively. Expression of phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1), interferon regulating factor (IRF)-1 and suppressors of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) was determined in the thoracoabdominal aorta using Western blot analysis. 4. After 8 weeks, pravastatin treatment significantly prevented the formation of atherosclerotic lesions (P < 0.05) and reduced serum IFN-gamma concentrations (P < 0.05) and levels of IFN-gamma mRNA within the aorta (P < 0.01). Pravastatin significantly decreased the expressions of pSTAT1 and IRF-1 within the aorta and significantly increased expression of SOCS1. 5. These results suggest that the actions of pravastatin in attenuating the action of IFN-gamma and subsequently preventing aortic atherosclerosis may depend, at least in part, on modulation of STAT1 activity. This providing us with a new therapeutic approach and a clearer insight into the clinical benefits of pravastatin.", 
    "26": "Fenofibrate is a PPAR-alpha agonist indicated for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia, and is approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, lipid abnormalities commonly observed in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, including Type 2 diabetes and/or metabolic syndromes. Treatment with fenofibrate lowers triglycerides, raises HDL-cholesterol and decreases concentrations of small LDL-cholesterol particles and apolipoprotein B. Fenofibrate is particularly effective for reducing postprandial VLDL and LDL particle concentrations, and the increased oxidative stress and inflammatory response that occurs after a fatty meal. In addition, nonlipid pleiotropic effects mediated by PPAR-alpha are likely to contribute to the reduction in atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular events, and have beneficial effects on diabetes-related microvascular diseases. While current approaches to treating dyslipidemia to prevent cardiovascular diseases focus on statin therapy, it is increasingly clear that substantial residual risk persists. The clinical significance of combination therapy with fenofibrate and a statin to macrovascular and microvascular risk is being evaluated in a large outcomes study.", 
    "27": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) carries significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Elevated LDL-cholesterol and reduced HDL-cholesterol levels are well-recognized CHD risk factors. Despite guideline recommendations for intensive therapy among patients at high risk for CHD to lower LDL-cholesterol, such lowering has failed to prevent approximately two-thirds of cardiovascular events. As a result of new data, guidelines have begun to focus on non-HDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides as treatment targets, with the end result being a recommendation for combination therapy, such as niacin plus statin for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Compared with statin monotherapy, a combination of niacin and statin therapy provides beneficial effects on a broad range of lipid particles and some evidence suggests a further reduction in CHD risk. Recent studies have shown that the combination of a fixed dose of extended-release niacin plus simvastatin reduces non-HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio by approximately 50% while increasing HDL-cholesterol by 25%. The safety of this combination is consistent with the safety profiles of each individual component and is well tolerated.

No significant between-group differences in HDL-C and C-reactive protein were observed within each stratum.

Additionally, low plasma total cholesterol (TC) concentrations have been associated with higher mortality in heart failure. Plasma CoQ(10) is closely associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which might contribute to this association. Therefore we tested the hypothesis that plasma CoQ(10) is a predictor of total mortality in CHF and could explain this association.",

Multivariable analysis allowing for effects of standard predictors of survival--including age at admission, gender, previous myocardial infarction, N-terminal peptide of B-type natriuretic peptide, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (modification of diet in renal disease)--indicated CoQ(10) was an independent predictor of survival, whether dichotomized at the ROC curve cut-point (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 3.3) or the median (HR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.6).",

Either pravastatin (5 mg/kg/d) or vehicle alone was orally administered to male C57BL/6J mice from day 2 after a transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was performed. The ER stress signaling pathway was also studied in pressure-overloaded hearts and in cultured cardiomyocytes treated with TNFalpha. Four weeks after TAC, pravastatin treatment significantly reduced heart/body weight and lung/body weight ratios and increased left ventricular (LV) fractional shortening compared with the TAC alone. Markers of ER stress, such as increases in ER chaperone and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression and enhanced phosphorylation of anti-phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha), were observed in the hearts of TAC mice, while pravastatin treatment significantly blunted these changes. Pravastatin-treated TAC mice also showed less cardiac apoptosis. Cardiac expression of TNFalpha was increased in TAC mice, and TNFalpha induced ER stress in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, either of which was significantly inhibited by pravastatin. These findings indicate that pravastatin inhibits cardiac remodeling in mice subjected to pressure overload, and that this action is associated with inhibition of the ER stress signaling pathway.", 
    "38": "Berberine (BBR) is a novel natural hypolipidemic agent. This study investigates whether BBR, similar to statins, exerts pleiotropic effects on endothelial tissue factor (TF) expression. BBR enhanced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and thrombin induced TF expression in human endothelial cells by 3.5-fold. These effects were paralleled by an enhanced TF surface activity. In contrast, expression of TF pathway inhibitor was impaired. BBR enhanced TNF-alpha induced TF mRNA expression; however, TF promoter activity was inhibited. Activation of ERK and p38 remained unaffected, while c-Jun terminal NH(2) kinase was inhibited. BBR reduced TF mRNA degradation rates, prolonging its half-life from 1.1 to 4.3 h. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin impaired thrombin induced TF expression, and BBR blunted this inhibition. Simvastatin did not affect TNF-alpha induced TF expression, and BBR enhanced TF under these conditions. Administration of BBR (100 mg/kg/d) increased TF activity and impaired TFPI expression in carotid artery of ApoE(-/-) mice. BBR enhances TF via mRNA stabilization at clinically relevant concentrations. Clinical application of BBR, either as an alternative to or in combination with statins, should be considered with caution.", 
    "39": "Together, high blood pressure (BP) and high cholesterol levels constitute a cumulative risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Elevations in cholesterol increase BP through upregulation of angiotensin type 1 receptors, with a corresponding increase in cholesterol oxidation due to elevations in BP. Hence, control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and BP through coadministration of an antihypertensive and a statin have potential benefit in the management of CHD.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of atorvastatin in the treatment of NASH associated with hyperlipidemia. This prospective study included 31 patients with biopsy-proven NASH with hyperlipidemia. Body mass index, serum lipids, liver function tests, fibrosis markers, and adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) were measured periodically during an open-label study of atorvastatin (10 mg daily) for 24 months. Standard weight-loss counseling was continued during the treatment period. Oral glucose tolerance test and liver density assessed by computerized tomography were performed before and after treatment. Follow-up liver biopsy was performed in 17 patients. All 31 patients had high cholesterol levels at baseline, and 20 also presented high triglyceride levels. The body mass index and serum glucose levels did not change during the treatment. After treatment, 23 patients (74.2%) presented normal transaminase levels. Adiponectin levels were significantly increased, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were significantly decreased. However, leptin levels were not changed significantly. The concentration of long-chain fatty acids was decreased; and significant decreases were observed in C18:2,n-6 (linoleic acid, -21%) and C20:4,n-6 (arachidonic acid, -22%). Liver steatosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score were significantly improved, whereas 4 patients had increased fibrosis stage. The NASH-related metabolic parameters improved with therapy, including fibrosis in some patients. However, 4 of 17 patients had progression of fibrosis over the 2-year period, with 3 of them progressing to stage 3.

In comparison, the LDLR activity was 86.1+/-11.6% (K790X) and 73.3+/-6.3% (P664L) of that of the control group when measured by the conventional method, indicating that impairment of LDLR function in FH K790X subjects was much more clearly differentiated with our method than with the conventional method (paired t-test, p<0.0001). The levels of LDLR expression also showed similar tendencies, that is, 89.4+/-13.2% (K790X) and 76.9+/-17.4% (P664L) of that of the control group when measured by the conventional method, and 78.1+/-9.7% (K790X) and 70.3+/-26.5% (P664L) when measured by our new method.

Confidence intervals for the treatment effect are typically calculated without acknowledging uncertainty in the estimated propensity scores, and intuitively this may yield inferences, which are falsely precise. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian method that models the propensity score as a latent variable. We consider observational studies with a dichotomous treatment, dichotomous outcome, and measured confounders where the log odds ratio is the measure of effect. Markov chain Monte Carlo is used for posterior simulation. We study the impact of modelling uncertainty in the propensity scores in a case study investigating the effect of statin therapy on mortality in Ontario patients discharged from hospital following acute myocardial infarction. Our analysis reveals that the Bayesian credible interval for the treatment effect is 10 per cent wider compared with a conventional propensity score analysis. Using simulations, we show that when the association between treatment and confounders is weak, then this increases uncertainty in the estimated propensity scores. Bayesian interval estimates for the treatment effect are longer on average, though there is little improvement in coverage probability. A novel feature of the proposed method is that it fits models for the treatment and outcome simultaneously rather than one at a time. The method uses the outcome variable to inform the fit of the propensity model. We explore the performance of the estimated propensity scores using cross-validation.", 
    "54": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive, fatal disease. Current treatments including prostanoids, endothelin-1 (ET-1) antagonists, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, have sought to address the pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction associated with the condition. These treatments may slow the progression of the disease but do not afford a cure. Future treatments must target more directly the structural vascular changes that impair blood flow through the pulmonary circulation. Several novel therapeutic targets have been proposed and are under active investigation, including soluble guanylyl cyclase, phosphodiesterases, tetrahydrobiopterin, 5-HT2B receptors, vasoactive intestinal peptide, receptor tyrosine kinases, adrenomedullin, Rho kinase, elastases, endogenous steroids, endothelial progenitor cells, immune cells, bone morphogenetic protein and its receptors, potassium channels, metabolic pathways, and nuclear factor of activated T cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, statins, 5-HT2B receptor antagonists, EPCs and soluble guanylyl cyclase activators are among the most advanced, having produced encouraging results in animal models, and human trials are underway. This review summarises the current research in this area and speculates on their likely success.",

    "69": "Statins, which are effective lipid-lowering drugs, also possess anti-inflammatory potential. However, circulating lipoproteins may also play a protective role during acute inflammatory diseases because of their ability to bind bacterial toxins. Low cholesterol levels have been reported in inflammatory conditions, and plasma cholesterol concentrations inversely correlate with severity and clinical outcome in septic patients. It is thus paradoxical that statins, which drastically reduce circulating cholesterol levels, should be beneficial in patients with inflammatory disease who are already hypocholesterolemic. We investigated the effect of simvastatin on LPS-induced nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, TNF release, and mortality in guinea pigs, an animal model with a lipoprotein profile and pattern similar to humans. In the present study, simvastatin reduced circulating total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 68% and 76%, respectively, and LPS-induced mortality from 73% to 20%. This reduction was accompanied by a significant reduction of NF-kappaB activation in the liver tissue, splenocytes, and plasma TNF levels by about 80%, 50%, and 77%, respectively. Our data suggest that simvastatin, despite lowering circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreased LPS toxicity by reduction of NF-kappaB activation and subsequent release of TNF by modulating 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and therefore deserves consideration as a possible adjuvant therapy in acute inflammatory disease.",

AML mononuclear cells (n = 17) were sorted in CD34(+) and CD34(-) fractions and compared to normal CD34(+/-) cells (n = 7). The percentage of surviving cells upon exposure to lovastatin (25-100 microM) and/or chemotherapeutics (cytarabin or daunorubicin) was determined with a luminescent cell viability assay. The results demonstrate that the primitive CD34(+) subpopulation of normal and AML cells displayed a higher sensitivity to lovastatin than the more mature CD34(-) subpopulation. The combination of lovastatin and chemotherapeutics resulted in a more pronounced inhibitory effect on both subpopulations. In contrast to the homogeneous results in normal CD34(+) cells, a distinct heterogeneity in lovastatin sensitivity was found in AML samples. Therefore, a group of normal (n = 11) and abnormal (n = 6) responders were identified based on a reduced or increased cell survival compared to normal CD34(+) cells. This distinction was not only observed in the CD34(+) AML subfraction but also in CD34(+)CD38(-)AML cells. In the abnormal responder group, 50% of patients presented with unfavorable cytogenetics and significant higher peripheral blast cell counts, which coincided with poor treatment results. In summary, the findings indicate that the primitive subfraction of CD34(+) AML cells is in the majority of cases affected by lovastatin treatment, which is potentiated when combined with chemotherapeutics.

    "106": "Atherosclerotic plaques are composed of a lipid rich core, which is covered by a collagen rich fibrous cap. Rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque with superimposed thrombosis is the main cause of acute coronary syndromes, including acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina. The stability of the plaque depends on its collagen content; degradation of the collagen leads to a vulnerable plaque that is prone to rupture. Recent studies have demonstrated a critical role for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the degradation of the collagen content and the reduction of mechanical stability of the atherosclerotic plaques. Increased expression of various MMPs has been shown in the tissue sections of atherosclerotic plaques. The increased expression of MMPs in the atheroma also leads to increased MMP levels in the circulation. The cholesterol lowering drugs - 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) - decrease the tissue expression of various MMPs in atheromatous plaques by attenuating the inflammatory process that promotes MMP expression during the course of atherosclerosis. However, the effect of statin treatment on the serum levels of MMP-13, which has a critical role in the initiation of collagen degradation, is unknown. On the basis of these previous studies, we discuss the need for studies on the effect of statin treatment on the serum levels of MMP-13 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) levels in hypercholesterolemic patients.",

The present study examined the effects of changes in the transporter activities on the systemic and liver exposure of pravastatin using a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. Scaling factors, determined by comparing in vivo and in vitro parameters of pravastatin in rats for the hepatic uptake and canalicular efflux, were obtained. The simulated plasma and liver concentrations and biliary excretion profiles were very close to the observed data in rats under linear and nonlinear conditions. In vitro parameters, determined in human cryopreserved hepatocytes and canalicular membrane vesicles, were extrapolated to in vivo parameters using the scaling factors obtained in rats. The simulated plasma concentrations of pravastatin were close to the reported values in humans. Sensitivity analyses showed that changes in the hepatic uptake ability altered the plasma concentration of pravastatin markedly but had a minimal effect on the liver concentration, whereas changes in the ability of canalicular efflux altered the liver concentration of pravastatin markedly but had a small effect on the plasma concentration. In conclusion, the model allows the prediction of the disposition of pravastatin in humans. The present study suggests that changes in the OATP1B1 activities may have a small and a large impact on the therapeutic efficacy and side effect (myopathy) of pravastatin, respectively, whereas those in the MRP2 activities may have opposite impacts (i.e., large and small impacts on the therapeutic efficacy and side effect).",

We found, in biceps femoris muscle, decreased Akt(Ser473), FOXO1(Ser253) and FOXO3a(Ser253) phosphorylation in the cytosol (P < 0.05, P < 0.05, P < 0.001, respectively) and decreased phosphorylation of FOXO1 in the nucleus after 12 days simvastatin when compared to Control (P < 0.05). This was paralleled by a marked increase in the transcription of downstream targets of FOXO, i.e. MAFbx (P < 0.001), MuRF-1 (P < 0.001), cathepsin-L (P < 0.05), PDK2 (P < 0.05) and PDK4 (P < 0.05). These changes were accompanied by increased PPARalpha (P < 0.05), TNFalpha (P < 0.01), IL6 (P < 0.01), Mt1A (P < 0.01) mRNA and increased muscle glycogen (P < 0.05) compared to Control. RhoA activity decreased after 4 days simvastatin (P < 0.05); however, activity was no different from Control after 12 days. Simvastatin down-regulated PI3k/Akt signalling, independently of RhoA, and up-regulated FOXO transcription factors and downstream gene targets known to be implicated in proteasomal- and lysosomal-mediated muscle proteolysis, carbohydrate oxidation, oxidative stress and inflammation in an in vivo model of statin-induced myopathy. These changes occurred in the main before evidence of extensive myopathy or a decline in the muscle protein to DNA ratio.",

Concomitant risk factors included diabetes (n = 3) and hypertension (n = 7) and 8 patients had coronary artery disease. Molecular analysis revealed that 4 patients had a mutation in the ABCA1 gene. Patients were assigned to sequentially receive atorvastatin 20 mg/day, fenofibrate 200 mg/day, and extended-release niacin 2 g/day for 8 weeks, with a 4-week washout period between each treatment. Patients in whom a statin was required, according to current treatment guidelines, were kept on atorvastatin throughout the study. Baseline HDL cholesterol level was 0.63 +/- 0.12 mmol/L (24 +/- 5 mg/dl), triglycerides 2.01 +/- 0.98 mmol/L (180 +/- 86 mg/dl), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 2.29 +/- 0.95 mmol/L (94 +/- 39 mg/dl). Mean percent changes in HDL cholesterol on atorvastatin, fenofibrate, and niacin were -6% (p = NS), +6% (p = NS), and +22% (p <0.05), respectively. Furthermore, niacin significantly increased the large alpha-1 apolipoprotein A-I-containing HDL subspecies (12 to 17 nm). In conclusion, niacin was the only effective drug to increase HDL cholesterol. The absolute increase in HDL cholesterol, approximately 0.10 mmol/L (3.9 mg/dl), is of uncertain clinical significance. Biomarkers of HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux were not changed by niacin therapy. Atorvastatin or fenofibrate had little effect on HDL cholesterol; atorvastatin decreased the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio by 26%. Fenofibrate did not change HDL cholesterol levels and caused an increase in LDL cholesterol. Aggressive LDL cholesterol lowering may be the strategy of choice in such patients.", 
    "144": "The Treating to New Targets (TNT) study demonstrated that intensive atorvastatin therapy to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations well below recommended target levels provides an incremental clinical benefit in patients with stable coronary artery disease. This post hoc analysis of the TNT study was conducted to investigate whether this benefit extends to patients with previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 10,001 patients with clinically evident coronary artery disease, including 5,407 patients with previous PCI, were randomized to atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg/day and followed for a median of 4.9 years. The primary end point was the occurrence of a first major cardiovascular event. Revascularization, a component of a secondary end point, was also examined. In patients with previous PCI, mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at study end were 79.5 mg/dl in the 80-mg arm and 100.8 mg/dl in the 10-mg arm. First major cardiovascular events occurred in 230 patients (8.6%) receiving high-dose atorvastatin and 289 patients (10.6%) receiving low-dose atorvastatin (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.94, p = 0.008).

In conclusion, intensive lipid lowering to a mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 79.5 mg/dl (2.1 mmol/L) with atorvastatin 80 mg/day in patients with previous PCI reduces major cardiovascular events by 21% and repeat revascularizations by 27% compared with a less intensive lipid-lowering regimen.", 
    "145": "Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a fatal lymphoproliferative disease that develops in human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected individuals. Despite the accumulating knowledge of the molecular biology of HTLV-I-infected cells, effective therapeutic strategies remain to be established. Recent reports showed that the hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor statins have anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on certain tumor cells through inhibition of protein prenylation. Here, we report that statins hinder the survival of ATL cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation is responsible for these effects, since simultaneous treatment with isoprenoid precursors, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate or farnesyl pyrophosphate, but not a cholesterol precursor squalene, restored the viability of ATL cells. Simvastatin inhibited geranylgeranylation of small GTPases Rab5B and Rac1 in ATL cells, and a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-298 reduced ATL cell viability more efficiently than a farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277. These results not only unveil an important role for protein geranylgeranylation in ATL cell survival, but also implicate therapeutic potentials of statins in the treatment of ATL.",

Ninety-four adult patients on a stable PI-based antiretroviral therapy since at least 12 months, and presenting hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol level >250 mg/dL) of at least 3-month duration and unresponsive to a hypolipidaemic diet and physical exercise, were randomized to a hypolipidaemic treatment with rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), pravastatin (20 mg once daily) or atorvastatin (10 mg once daily), and were followed-up for 12 months. Among the 85 subjects who completed the study, rosuvastatin was employed in 26 cases, pravastatin in 31, and atorvastatin in 28. At the close of 1-year follow-up, statins led to a mean reduction of 21.2% and 23.6% versus baseline total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, respectively (p=0.002). Mean decrease in total cholesterol concentration was significantly greater with rosuvastatin (25.2%) than with pravastatin (17.6%; p=0.01) and atorvastatin (19.8%; p=0.03).

    "158": "Atorvastatin calcium (ATV) is one of the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide. Among the adverse effects observed for this lipid-lowering agent, clinical cases of cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported and associated with photosensitivity disorders. Previous work dealing with ATV photochemistry has shown that exposure to natural sunlight in aqueous solution leads to photoproducts resulting from oxidation of the pyrrole ring and from cyclization to a phenanthrene derivative. Laser flash photolysis of ATV, at both 266 and 308 nm, led to a transient spectrum with two maxima at lambda= 360 and lambda= 580 nm (tau= 41 micro), which was assigned to the primary intermediate of the stilbene-like photocyclization. On the basis of the absence of a triplet-triplet absorption, the role of the parent drug as singlet oxygen photosensitizer can be discarded. By contrast, a stable phenanthrene-like photoproduct would be a good candidate to play this role. Laser flash photolysis of this compound showed a triplet-triplet transient absorption at lambdamax = 460 nm with a lifetime of 26 micro, which was efficiently quenched by oxygen (kq = 3 (+/-0.2) x 10(9) M(-1) s(-1)). Its potential to photosensitize formation of singlet oxygen was confirmed by spin trapping experiments, through conversion of TEMP to the stable free radical TEMPO. The photoreactivity of the phenanthrene-like photoproduct was investigated using Trp as a marker. The disappearance of the amino acid fluorescence (lambdamax = 340 nm) after increasing irradiation times at 355 nm was taken as a measurement of photodynamic oxidation. To confirm the involvement of a type II mechanism, the same experiment was also performed in D2O; this resulted in a significant enhancement of the reaction rate. On the basis of the obtained photophysical and photochemical results, the phototoxicity of atorvastatin can be attributed to singlet oxygen formation with the phenanthrene-like photoproduct as a photosensitizer.",

    "161": "Simvastatin is the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the blockbuster cholesterol lowering drug Zocor. We have previously developed an Escherichia coli based whole-cell biocatalytic platform towards the synthesis of simvastatin sodium salt (SS) starting from the precursor monacolin J sodium salt (MJSS). The centerpiece of the biocatalytic approach is the simvastatin synthase LovD, which is highly prone to misfolding and aggregation when overexpressed from E. coli. Increasing the solubility of LovD without decreasing its catalytic activity can therefore elevate the performance of the whole-cell biocatalyst. Using a combination of homology structural prediction and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two cysteine residues in LovD that are responsible for nonspecific intermolecular crosslinking, which leads to oligomer formation and protein aggregation. Replacement of Cys40 and Cys60 with alanine residues resulted in marked gain in both protein solubility and whole-cell biocatalytic activities. Further mutagenesis experiments converting these two residues to small or polar natural amino acids showed that C40A and C60N are the most beneficial, affording 27% and 26% increase in whole cell activities, respectively. The double mutant C40A/C60N combines the individual improvements and displayed approximately 50% increase in protein solubility and whole-cell activity. Optimized fed-batch high-cell-density fermentation of the double mutant in an E. coli strain engineered for simvastatin production quantitatively (>99%) converted 45 mM MJSS to SS within 18 h, which represents a significant improvement over the performance of wild-type LovD under identical conditions. The high efficiency of the improved whole-cell platform renders the biocatalytic synthesis of SS an attractive substitute over the existing semisynthetic routes.",

His treatment included saphenous vein, left internal mammary artery and gastroepiploic artery grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and intragraft thrombolytic therapy, directional coronary atherectomy, cutting balloon angioplasty, intracoronary stenting with bare-metal and drug-eluting stents, treatment for in-stent restenosis, stenting of the left main and circumflex coronary arteries and saphenous vein graft as well as intracoronary pressure wire diagnostics. In addition to his statin therapy, antiplatelets and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, he also underwent biventricular automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation and atrioventricular node radiofrequency ablation for his impaired left ventricular function, ventricular tachycardia and rapid atrial fibrillation. The present unusual case represents almost 'the whole nine yards' of treatment that has become available to patients with coronary artery disease during the past 30 years of technological development.",

Eligible patients were aged > 50 yrs, with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) between 9 and 19, total prostate volume (TPV) >40 mL, and serum PSA > 1.5 ng/mL. Patients were divided in two groups: those with and those without lipidemia. After selection, eligible BPH patients with lipidemia (n = 18) were prescribed lovastatin 80 mg daily and finasteride 5 mg daily, while eligible patients without lipidemia (n = 15) were prescribed only finasteride 5 mg daily. IPSS, TPV and serum PSA were evaluated at end point (4 months).",

The deduced amino acid sequence encodes a 1325-amino-acid protein, which shows 89.4% and 80.2% homology with human BSEP and rat Bsep, respectively. The transcript of the dog Bsep gene was detected at a high level in liver, but not other tissues, by quantitative RT-PCR. The BSEP-expressing membrane vesicles isolated from Sf9 cells exhibited saturable uptake of [(3)H]taurocholic acid with Michaelis constants (K(m)) of 33.7, 22.2 and 19.9 microM for the dog, rat and human transporters, respectively. The uptake of [(3)H]taurocholic acid by all three transporters was significantly inhibited by troglitazone, glibenclamide, and other several inhibitors, while pravastatin inhibited dog Bsep and human BSEP, but not rat Bsep at 100 microM. The IC(50) of troglitazone for dog Bsep, human BSEP, and rat Bsep were 32, 20, and 60 microM, and those of pravastatin were 441, 240 and >1,000 microM, respectively. In conclusion, while dog Bsep shows similar ATP-dependent bile acid transport characteristics to human BSEP and rat Bsep, there is a species difference in affinity for drugs such as pravastatin and troglitazone.",

Several species belonging to the class Zygomycetes are considered agents of opportunistic human or animal infections. In the present work, 15 fungal isolates representing eight clinically important genera (Absidia, Micromucor, Mortierella, Mucor, Rhizomucor, Rhizopus, Saksenaea and Syncephalastrum) were investigated. The efficiency with which fluvastatin inhibited growth in the presence of suramin (100 microg ml(-1)) was studied. The investigated compounds acted synergistically and additively on the growth when a strain was resistant to suramin and sensitive to fluvastatin; at the same time, antagonistic interactions were detected when strains were sensitive to both agents. In these cases, the growth inhibition effect of suramin was dominant.",

The role of cholesterol-lowering medications, HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors or statins, in reducing the risk of AMD or of delaying its progression has not been fully investigated. A 3-year prospective randomized controlled trial of 40 mg simvastatin per day compared to placebo in subjects at high risk of AMD progression is described. This paper outlines the primary aims of the Age-Related Maculopathy Statin Study (ARMSS), and the methodology involved. Standardized clinical grading of macular photographs and comparison of serial macular digital photographs, using the International grading scheme, form the basis for assessment of primary study outcomes. In addition, macular function is assessed at each visit with detailed psychophysical measurements of rod and cone function. Information collected in this study will assist in the assessment of the potential value of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins) in reducing the risk of AMD progression.",

In JELIS (18 645 patients, follow-up 4.6 years), high dose omega-3 given to Japanese patients on a high fish diet and already on statin treatment produced further benefit with a 19% reduction of nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes; fatal cardiac events are not affected. CCSPS (4870 patients, follow-up 4 years), a secondary prevention trial using xuezhikang, a commercial red yeast rice preparation, produced a 46% reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary death. There has been no trial to show that garlic reduces clinical cardiovascular outcomes. A rigorous trial with constant assessment of chemicals in the study material in 192 patients found that over a 6-month follow-up, raw garlic and 2 commercial preparations do not significantly affect lipid levels.",

    "186": "Statins, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, reduce plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels decreasing the incidence of coronary events. However, the observed benefit of statins appears to extend beyond their lipid-lowering effects. Previous studies by our group have demonstrated that atorvastatin in oxidized LDL incubated macrophages modifies the gene expression profile of certain enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism, mainly stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). SCD is a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids and its expression is mediated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). The aim of this study was to determine whether atorvastatin might affect the fatty acid composition in macrophages and if their SCD gene expression profile could explain this effect. Therefore, THP-1 macrophages were treated with atorvastatin and native or oxidized LDL, their fatty acid composition was determined by gas-chromatography, and the SCD and SREBP-1 gene expression profile was analysed using quantitative RT-PCR. We found that atorvastatin reduces the percentage of palmitoleic and oleic acids in THP-1 cells incubated with oxLDL, which could be explained by the inhibition of SCD and SREBP-1 gene expression. The observed results were reversed when mevalonate was added to THP-1 macrophages. This would suggest that inhibition of SCD in THP-1 macrophages incubated with oxLDL and the change in fatty acid composition is an important effect of atorvastatin.",

Patients were excluded if the dosage of their antidiabetic drugs was changed, if their drug therapy was altered within 3 months before starting statin therapy, or if events occurred that could affect glycemic control such as hospitalization.",

Arbitrary blood glucose levels increased from 147+/-51 mg/dL (mean+/-SD) to 176+/-69 mg/dL in group A, but only changed minimally from 136+/-31 to 134+/-32 mg/dL in group Pr and from 155+/-53 to 154+/-51 mg/dL in group Pi. HbA(1C) increased from 7.0+/-1.1% to 7.4+/-1.2% in group A, while it was 6.9+/-0.9% versus 6.9+/-1.0% in group Pr, and 7.3+/-1.0% versus 7.2+/-1.0% in group Pi.

    "191": "Changes in plasma lipoprotein profiles, especially low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), are a common biomarker for several inflammatory and immune diseases, including atherosclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. We examined the effect of simvastatin on HDL-induced anti-inflammatory actions. HDL and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid component of the lipoprotein, inhibited TNF alpha-induced expression of VCAM-1, which was associated with NO synthase (NOS) activation, in human umbilical venous endothelial cells. The HDL- but not S1P-induced anti-inflammatory actions were enhanced by a prior treatment of the cells with simvastatin in a manner sensitive to mevalonic acid. Simvastatin stimulated the expression of scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) and endothelial NOS. As for S1P receptors, however, the statin inhibited the expression of S1P(3) receptor mRNA but caused no detectable change in S1P(1) receptor expression. The reconstituted HDL, a stimulator of SR-BI, mimicked HDL actions in a simvastatin-sensitive manner. The HDL- and reconstituted HDL-induced actions were blocked by small interfering RNA specific to SR-BI regardless of simvastatin treatment. The statin-induced expression of SR-BI was attenuated by constitutively active RhoA and small interfering RNA specific to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha. Administration of simvastatin in vivo stimulated endothelial SR-BI expression, which was accompanied by the inhibition of the ex vivo monocyte adhesion in aortas from TNF alpha-injected mice. In conclusion, simvastatin induces endothelial SR-BI expression through a RhoA- and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha-dependent mechanism, thereby enhancing the HDL-induced activation of NOS and the inhibition of adhesion molecule expression.", 
    "192": "In addition to suppressing cholesterol synthesis and uptake, oxysterols also activate glycerophospholipid and SM (sphingomyelin) synthesis, possibly to buffer cells from excess sterol accumulation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of oxysterols on the CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho (phosphatidylcholine) synthesis using wild-type and sterol-resistant CHO (Chinese-hamster ovary) cells expressing a mutant of SCAP [SREBP (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein) cleavage-activating protein] (CHO-SCAP D443N). [(3)H]Choline-labelling experiments showed that 25OH (25-hydroxycholesterol), 22OH (22-hydroxycholesterol) and 27OH (27-hydroxycholesterol) increased PtdCho synthesis in CHO cells as a result of CCTalpha (CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase alpha) translocation and activation at the NE (nuclear envelope). These oxysterols also activate PtdCho synthesis in J774 macrophages. in vitro, CCTalpha activity was stimulated 2- to 2.5-fold by liposomes containing 5 mol% 25OH, 22OH or 27OH. Inclusion of up to 5 mol% cholesterol did not further activate CCTalpha. 25OH activated CCTalpha in CHO-SCAP D443N cells leading to a transient increase in PtdCho synthesis and accumulation of CDP-choline. CCTalpha translocation to the NE and intranuclear tubules in CHO-SCAP D443N cells was complete after 1 h exposure to 25OH compared with only partial translocation by 4-6 h in CHO-Mock cells. These enhanced responses in CHO-D443N cells were sterol-dependent since depletion with cyclodextrin or lovastatin resulted in reduced sensitivity to 25OH. However, the lack of effect of cholesterol on in vitro CCT activity indicates an indirect relationship or involvement of other sterols or oxysterol. We conclude that translocation and activation of CCTalpha at nuclear membranes by side-chain hydroxylated sterols are regulated by the cholesterol status of the cell.",

Optimum conditions such as pH, scan rate, and pulse amplitude were studied, and validation of the proposed methods was performed. The proposed methods proved to be accurate, precise, robust, and specific for determination of the 3 drugs. The relative standard deviation values were <2%, indicating that these methods are precise.
