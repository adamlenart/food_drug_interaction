CYP3A5*3C (AGT haplotype) was associated to lower basal CYP3A5 mRNA expression in HC (p<0.045), however none of the haplotype groups impacted treatment.", 
    "6": "It is likely that cholesterolemia status changes promoted by atorvastatin play a role in regulating CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 mRNA expression in PBMCs, as well as CYP3A activity. CYP3A5*3C (AGT haplotype) also contributes for the variability of CYP3A5 mRNA levels in PBMCs.", 
    "7": "Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in brain cells increases extracellular glutamate concentration leading to excitotoxicity. Glutamate uptake from the synaptic cleft is carried out by glutamate transporters, which are likely to be modulated by oxidative stress. Therefore, oxidative stress is associated with reduced activity of glutamate transporters and glutamine synthetase, thus increasing extracellular glutamate levels that may aggravate damage to brain cells. Atorvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering agent, has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects. The aim of this study was to investigate if in vivo atorvastatin treatment would have protective effects against hippocampal slices subjected to OGD, ex vivo. Atorvastatin pretreatment promoted increased cell viability after OGD and reoxygenation of hippocampal slices. Atorvastatin-induced neuroprotection may be related to diminished oxidative stress, since it prevented OGD-induced decrement of non-proteic thiols (NPSH) levels and increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Atorvastatin pretreatment also prevented the OGD-induced decrease in glutamate uptake and glutamine synthetase activity, although it had no effect on OGD-induced excitatory aminoacids release. Addition of cholesterol before OGD and reoxygenation, abolished the protective effect of atorvastatin on cellular viability as well as on glutamate uptake and glutamine synthetase activity. Therefore, atorvastatin is capable of preventing OGD-induced cell death, an effect achieved due to modulation of glutamate uptake and glutamine synthetase activity, and associated with diminished oxidative stress. Additionally, atorvastatin effects were dependent on its action on cholesterol synthesis inhibition. Thus, atorvastatin might be a useful strategy in the prevention of glutamate exitotoxicity involved in brain injuries such as vascular disorders.",

For patients with lower baseline cardiovascular risks, health and economic benefits were smaller; for 65-year-old women, statins yielded 0.06 QALYs and increased costs by $1,900 ($33,400 per QALY gained). Results were sensitive to rates of rhabdomyolysis and drug costs. Statins are less cost-effective when obtained at average retail prices, particularly in patients at lower CVD risk.",

At the end of follow-up, EAT regressed more in the atorvastatin than in the pravastatin group (median, -3.38% vs. -0.83%, p = 0.025). The EAT percent change from baseline was significant in the atorvastatin, but not the pravastatin group (p < 0.001 and p = 0.2, respectively).

    "27": "Embryoid bodies (EBs) generated from embryonic stem cells are used to study processes of differentiation within a three dimensional (3D) cell environment. In many instances however, EBs are dispersed to single cell suspensions with a subsequent monolayer culture. Moreover, where the 3D integrity of an EB is maintained, cytokines or drugs of interest to stimulate differentiation are often added directly to the culture medium at fixed concentrations and effects are usually limited to the outer layers of the EB. The aim of this study was to create an EB model with localised drug and or growth factor delivery directly within the EB. Using poly(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) microparticles (MPs) with an average diameter of 13\u03bcm, we have demonstrated controllable incorporation of defined numbers of MPs within human ES cell derived EBs, down to 1 MP per EB. This was achieved by coating MPs with human ES cell lysate and centrifugation of specific ratios of ES cells and MPs to form 3D aggregates. Using MPs loaded with simvastatin (pro or active drug) or BMP-2, we have demonstrated osteogenic differentiation within the 3D aggregates, maintained in culture for up to 21days, and quantified by real time QPCR for osteocalcin. Immunostaining for RUNX2 and osteocalcin, and also histochemical staining with picrosirius red to demonstrate collage type 1 and Alizarin red to demonstrate calcium/mineralisation further demonstrated osteogenic differentiation and revealed regional staining associated with the locations of MPs within the aggregates. We also demonstrated endothelial differentiation within human ES cell-derived aggregates using VEGF loaded MPs. In conclusion, we demonstrate an effective and reliable approach for engineering stem aggregates with definable number of MPs within the 3D cellular structure. We also achieved localised osteogenic and endothelial differentiation associated with MPs releasing encapsulated drug molecules or cytokines directly within the cell aggregate. This provides a powerful tool for controlling and investigating differentiation within 3D cell cultures and has applications to drug delivery, drug discovery, stem cell biology, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

Paradoxically, a \"healthy obese\" state exists, but substantial knowledge gaps also exist regarding human adipose-phenotype determinants. Surgical major amputation (AMP) patients are the \"sickest-of-the-sick.\" Conversely, elective knee replacement (TKR) is reserved for patients who expect continued health and longevity. To delineate human adipose biology variability and clinical determinants, we studied fresh subcutaneous adipose from AMP patients, using TKR patients as controls. We hypothesized that AMP patients would display a pro-inflammatory adipokine signature, and that certain clinical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, high BMI, uremia) would independently drive elevated adipose inflammation.",

    "32": "A low n-3 to n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ratio is associated with cardiovascular events. However, the effects of this ratio on coronary atherosclerosis have not been fully examined, particularly in patients treated with different types of statins. This study compared the effects of n-3 to n-6 PUFA ratios on coronary atherosclerosis in patients treated with pitavastatin and pravastatin. Coronary atherosclerosis in nonculprit lesions in the percutaneous coronary intervention vessel was evaluated using virtual histology intravascular ultrasound in 101 patients at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention and 8 months after statin therapy. Pitavastatin and pravastatin were used to treat 51 and 50 patients, respectively. Changes in the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid+DHA/AA ratios were not correlated with the percentage change in plaque volume in the pitavastatin group, whereas the percentage change in plaque volume and the changes in the DHA/AA ratio (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.404, p\u00a0= 0.004) and eicosapentaenoic acid+DHA/AA ratio (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.350, p\u00a0= 0.01) in the pravastatin group showed significant negative correlations. Multivariate regression analysis showed that age (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.306, p\u00a0= 0.02), the presence of diabetes mellitus (\u03b2\u00a0= 0.250, p\u00a0= 0.048), and changes in the DHA/AA ratio (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.423, p\u00a0= 0.001) were significant predictors of the percentage change in plaque volume in patients treated with pravastatin.

GLUT4 protein levels were similar to control after treatment with ezetimibe alone (P=0.52) or pravastatin (P=0.32). There was no significant difference (P=0.098) in GLUT4 protein levels after co-treatment with CoQ10 between any of the treatments and control conditions.",

Steady-state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were achieved by day 11. Little accumulation of rosuvastatin after repeated, once-daily dosing was observed; the geometric mean accumulation ratio for rosuvastatin was 1.37 (coefficient of variation = 36.4 %). Clearance of rosuvastatin and its metabolites via dialysis was minimal. Following rosuvastatin 10 mg daily for 16 days, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were reduced from baseline by 30.6 %, 38.9 % and 30.6 %, respectively. Rosuvastatin was well tolerated.",

The most common cause of stenotic renal artery is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic renal stenosis is usually part of a systemic syndrome that involves hypertension, intrinsic renal damage, and cardiovascular morbidity. So far, large trials have not proven the superiority of interventional therapies to medical management. As a result, renal artery stenosis should be treated mainly as a coronary artery disease equivalent focusing on rigorous management of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. Antihypertensive treatment should include renin-angiotensin system blockade medication in most cases, while HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can be used even in chronic kidney disease with safety. Lifestyle modifications, such as cessation of smoking, and antiplatelet therapy have reduced the risk of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients.",

Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) have consistently been shown to decrease both LDL-C and CVD risk in almost all patient categories, with the exception of heart and kidney failure as well as advanced aortic stenosis. As a consequence, statins have become the cornerstone in current prevention guidelines. In patients who do not reach the LDL-C target, combination therapy with additional LDL-C lowering drugs (e.g. ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants or fibrates) should be considered. Guidelines provide different LDL-C levels to strive for, depending on the CVD risk. In this review, we describe the rationale for these LDL-C targets and how these goals might be reached by current and future therapies.", 
    "53": "Survival of melanoma patients after metastases detection remains short. Several clinical trials have shown moderate efficiency in improving patient survival, and the search for pharmacological agents to enhance the immune response and reduce melanoma metastases is still necessary. Statins block the mevalonate pathway, which leads to decreases in GTPase isoprenylation and activity, particularly those of the Ras superfamily. They are widely used as hypocholesterolemic agents in cardiovascular diseases and several studies have shown that they also have protective effects against cancers. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that treatment of melanoma cells with inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway, such as statins, favor the development of specific adaptive immune responses against these tumors. In the present study, we tested statin impact on the innate immune response against human metastatic melanoma cells. Our data shows that treatment of two human melanoma cell lines with statins induced a weak but significant increase of MHC class I Chain-related protein A (MICA) membrane expression. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma is involved in this statin-induced MICA overexpression, which is independent of Ras and Rho GTPase signaling pathways. Interestingly, this MICA overexpression makes melanoma cells more sensitive to in vitro lysis by NK cells. The impact of statin treatment on in vivo development of melanoma tumors and metastases was investigated in nude mice, because murine NK cells, which express NKG2D receptors, are able to recognize and kill human tumor cells expressing MICA. The results demonstrated that both local tumor growth and pulmonary metastases were strongly inhibited in nude mice injected with statin-treated melanoma cells. These results suggest that statins could be effective in melanoma immunotherapy treatments.",

Statins have long and quite successfully been used as cholesterol lowering drugs. They reversibly inhibit the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase activity, which is rate limiting in the early steps of the cholesterol synthesis pathway. In addition to these effects, it has also been amply shown that statins may efficiently trigger cancer cell apoptosis, making them a plausible therapeutic option for the treatment of cancer. Whether statins may prevent cancer occurrence is a matter of debate and an unanswered question; undoubtedly experimental models have clearly demonstrated the potential of statins as direct cytotoxic agents, which can reduce tumour development or metastasis spread, even more so when combined with cytotoxic drugs. Until now, however, only few data in humans support the idea that statins could rightfully belong to the group of anticancer drugs. Nevertheless, as cancer cell metabolism is being thoroughly revisited, the mevalonate pathway has recently been reported as truly oncogenic, presenting the attractive possibility that mevalonate pathway inhibitors, such as statins, may join the ranks of anticancer drugs.",

Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were induced in rats by L-NAME and cholesterol-enriched diet, respectively. In these animals, repeated administration of simvastatin decreased the systolic blood pressure, enhanced its progressive reductions induced by repeated administration of losartan, and corrected the compromised lipid profile. Concomitantly, repeated administration of simvastatin, losartan, or simvastatin in combination with losartan to these animals increased nitric oxide (NO) production and decreased the elevated serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. Effects of combined treatment were greater than those of simvastatin or losartan alone. In hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients, repeated administration of losartan decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increased NO production, and decreased the elevated serum MDA and hs-CRP levels. Addition of simvastatin to losartan therapy enhanced these effects and corrected the compromised lipid profile. Simvastatin inhibited the contractile responses of isolated aortic rings induced by angiotensin II and enhanced the inhibitory effect of losartan on this preparation. l-arginine and acetylcholine enhanced, while L-NAME inhibited the effects of simvastatin, losartan, and their combination on these contractile responses. Thus, simvastatin exerts antihypertensive effect in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals and enhances the antihypertensive effect of losartan in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals and patients.

Human bronchial fibroblasts derived from patients with diagnosed asthma display in vitro predestination towards TGF-\u03b2-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT), a key event in the bronchial wall remodelling. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxymethyl-3-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a key enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway and are widely used as antilipidemic drugs. The pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects of statins, independent of their cholesterol-lowering capacity, are also well established. Since commonly used anti-asthmatic drugs do not reverse the structural remodelling of the airways and statins have tentative anti-asthmatic activity, we have studied the effect of lovastatin on FMT in populations of human bronchial fibroblasts derived from asthmatic patients. We demonstrate that the intensity of FMT induced by TGF-\u03b21 was strongly and dose-dependently attenuated by lovastatin. Furthermore, we show that neither the suppression of prenylation of signalling proteins nor the effect on reactive oxygen species formation are important for lovastatin-induced inhibition of myofibroblast differentiation. On the other hand, we show that a squalene synthase inhibitor, zaragozic acid A, reduced the TGF-\u03b21-induced FMT to an extent comparable to lovastatin effect. Additionally we demonstrate that in bronchial fibroblast populations, both inhibitors (lovastatin and zaragozic acid A) attenuate the TGF-\u03b21-induced Smad2 nuclear translocation in a manner dependent on intracellular cholesterol level. Our data suggest that statins can directly, by decrease of intracellular cholesterol level, affect basic cell signalling events crucial for asthmatic processes and potentially prevent perilous bronchial wall remodelling associated with intensive myofibroblast formation.",

Sixty (60) male Wistar rats were subjected to ICH by stereotactic injection of 100 \u03bcL of autologous blood into the striatum and were treated with or without simvastatin or atorvastatin. Neurological functional outcome was evaluated by behavioral tests (mNSS and corner turn test) at different time points after ICH. Brain extracts were utilized for Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses to measure vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) expression, and nerve growth factor (NGF). Western blot was used to measure the changes in the Akt-mediated signaling pathway. Both the simvastatin- and atorvastatin-treated animals had significant neurological improvement at 2 weeks post-ICH. Simvastatin and atorvastatin treatment increased the expression of BDNF, VEGF and NGF in both low- and high-dose groups at 7 days after ICH (p < 0.05). Phosphorylation of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), and cAMP response element-binding proteins (CREB) were also increased at 7 days after statin treatment. These results suggest that the therapeutic effects of statins after experimental ICH may be mediated by the transient induction of BDNF, VEGF and NGF expression and the activation of the Akt-mediated signaling pathway.",

    "143": "Dyslipidemia is one of the key risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes mellitus. Despite the mounting clinical trial data, the management of dyslipidemia other than lowering the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) continues to be controversial. The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia are high plasma triglyceride concentration, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) concentration, and increased concentration of small dense LDL particles. These changes are caused by increased free fatty acid flux secondary to insulin resistance and aggravated by increased inflammatory adipokines. The availability of several lipid-lowering drugs and nutritional supplements offers novel and effective options for achieving target lipid levels in people with diabetes. While initiation of drug therapy based on differences in the lipid profile is an option, most practice guidelines recommend statins as first-line therapy. Although the evidence for clinical utility of combination of statins with fibrates or nicotinic acid in reducing cardiovascular events remains inconclusive, the preponderance of evidence suggests that a subgroup who have high triglycerides and low HDL-c levels may benefit from combination therapy of statins and fibrates. The goal of therapy is to achieve at least 30-40\u00a0% reduction in LDL-c levels. Preferably the LDL-c should be less than 100\u00a0mg/dL in low-risk people and less than 70\u00a0mg/dL in those at high risk, including people with established CVD.",

Tx patients had moderate hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and dyslipoproteinemia, disturbed triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and HDL composition, decreased LCAT, and slightly increased hsCRP but no CETP activity. Spearman's correlation test showed the association between lipids and lipoproteins and LCAT or CETP, and multiple ridge stepwise forward regression showed that immunosuppressive therapy in Tx patients can disturb HDL and TRLs composition. The results suggest that inhibition or activation of LCAT is due, in part, to HDL-associated lipoprotein. Lipoprotein composition of apoAI, apoAIInonB, and apoCIIInonB in HDL particle and apoB:AII TRLs can contribute to decrease LCAT mass in Tx patients. Tx patients without statin and with lower triglycerides but higher HDL cholesterol concentration and disturbed lipoprotein composition of ApoAI and apoAII in HDL particle can decrease LCAT, increase LDL cholesterol, aggravate renal graft, and accelerate atherosclerosis and chronic heart diseases.",

Data was collected by review of the Pharmacy Database, the Electronic Medical Records Database (EMR viewer), and the Patient's Medical Records. Comparisons of lipid profile measurements at baseline and at first- and second-year intervals were taken. Results. Rosuvastatin (10\u2009mg) was the most effective at reducing LDL-C (29.03%). Atorvastatin reduced LDL-C the most at a dose of 40\u2009mg (22.8%), and pravastatin reduced LDL-C the most at a dose of 20\u2009mg (20.3%). All three statins were safe in relation to muscular and hepatic functions.

    "179": "The retrospective-gated CINE MRI provides a robust and simple way to detect and quantify contrast enhancement in atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic wall of ApoE(-/-) mice. From the same scan, plaque-related changes in stiffness of the aortic wall can be determined. In this mouse model, a correlation between vessel wall stiffness and atherosclerotic lesions was found.", 
    "180": "Lipophilic statins purportedly exert anti-tumoral effects on breast cancer by decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis. HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, is the target of statins. However, data on statin-induced effects on HMGCR activity in cancer are limited. Thus, this pre-operative study investigated statin-induced effects on tumor proliferation and HMGCR expression while analyzing HMGCR as a predictive marker for statin response in breast cancer treatment. The study was designed as a window-of-opportunity trial and included 50 patients with primary invasive breast cancer. High-dose atorvastatin (i.e., 80\u00a0mg/day) was prescribed to patients for 2\u00a0weeks before surgery. Pre- and post-statin paired tumor samples were analyzed for Ki67 and HMGCR immunohistochemical expression. Changes in the Ki67 expression and HMGCR activity following statin treatment were the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. Up-regulation of HMGCR following atorvastatin treatment was observed in 68\u00a0% of the paired samples with evaluable HMGCR expression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0005). The average relative decrease in Ki67 expression following atorvastatin treatment was 7.6\u00a0% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.39) in all paired samples, whereas the corresponding decrease in Ki67 expression in tumors expressing HMGCR in the pre-treatment sample was 24\u00a0% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Furthermore, post-treatment Ki67 expression was inversely correlated to post-treatment HMGCR expression (rs\u00a0=\u00a0-0.42; P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Findings from this study suggest that HMGCR is targeted by statins in breast cancer cells in vivo, and that statins may have an anti-proliferative effect in HMGCR-positive tumors. Future studies are needed to evaluate HMGCR as a predictive marker for the selection of breast cancer patients who may benefit from statin treatment.",

However, patients with advanced CKD on dialysis show little to no cardiovascular benefits from lipid-lowering therapy and have an exaggerated residual cardiovascular risk. HDL quantity and functionality may explain some of the residual risk. CKD modulates the level, composition and functionality of HDL, including impaired cholesterol acceptor function and pro-inflammatory effects. Although these abnormalities prevail in CKD, they do not track together and thus support the idea of separate and distinct mechanistic pathways for each of these critical functions of HDL.",

Thirty-one trials that include at least one event were identified, providing data for 48 429 patients with CKD, including 6690 major cardiovascular events and 6653 deaths. Statin therapy produced a 23% RR reduction (16-30) for major cardiovascular events (P<0.001), an 18% RR reduction (8-27) for coronary events, and 9% (1-16) reduction in cardiovascular or all-cause deaths, but had no significantly effect on stroke (21%, -12 to 44) or no clear effect on kidney failure events (5%, -1 to 10). Adverse events were not significantly increased by statins, including hepatic (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92-1.39) or muscular disorders (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95-1.09).

The formulation strategy included selection of oil phase based on saturated solubility studies and surfactant and co-surfactant screening on the basis of their emulsification ability. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the self-emulsifying region. Capryol 90 (20%) as oil, Cremophore RH40 (40%) as surfactant and Transcutol P (40%) as co-surfactant were concluded to be optimized components. The prepared SMEDDS was characterized through its droplet size, zeta potential, emulsification time, rheological determination and transmission electron microscopy. The optimized formulation exhibited 94% in vitro drug release, which was significantly higher than that of the drug solution. In vivo studies using the Triton-induced hyperlipidemia model in Wistar rats revealed considerable reduction in lipid levels compared to pure lovastatin.

    "204": "A randomized cross-over pharmacokinetic study of rosuvastatin calcium (single dose: 5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg; multiple doses: 10mg once daily for 7 days) was conducted in 12 healthy Chinese volunteers. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were determined by an LC-ESI-MS-MS method. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCB1, ABCG2, SLCOB1, CYP2C9 and CYP3A5 were determined by TaqMan (MGB) genotyping assay. An impact of the aforementioned SNPs on steady state pharmacokinetic parameters [average steady state concentration (Cav,ss) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve during the dosing interval at steady state (AUCss)], dose-normalized (based on 5 mg) pharmacokinetic parameters of single-dose rosuvastatin were further analyzed. Rosuvastatin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics and great inter-subject variability. Cav,ss, AUCss and dose-normalized peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and AUC(0-infinity) of single-dose rosuvastatin were significantly related with ABCB1 C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T polymorphisms and ABCB1 haplotypes. Compared to homozygous wild type and heterozygous mutation gene carriers, subjects carrying the variant ABCB1 1236TT, 2677 non-G or 3435TT genotype had higher Cav,ss, AUCss, Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) (p < 0.05). ABCB1 haplotype (1236TT-2677TT-3435TT) had significant influence on dose-normalized pharmacokinetics of single-dose rosuvastatin. ABCB1 haplotype (1236TT-2677TT-3435TT) carriers (n = 12) had obvious higher Cmax (11.16 +/- 3.10 microg x L(-1) vs 8.35 +/- 3.31 microg x L(-1), p < 0.05) and AUC(0-infinity) (86.61 +/- 24.32 microg x h x L(-1) vs 62.60 +/- 26.19 microg x h x L(-1), p < 0.05) compared to non-1236TT-2677TT-3435TT carriers (n = 24). ABCG2 c.421C > A had a significant impact on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics. Homozygotes (AA) carriers had obvious higher Cmax (12.20 +/- 4.09 microg x L(-1) vs 8.70 +/- 3.09 microg x L(-1), p < 0.05) and AUC(0-infinity) (98.74 +/- 25.36 microg x h x L(-1) vs 64.97 +/- 24.90 microg x h x L(-1), p < 0.05) values compared to heterozygotes (CA) and homozygotes (CC) carriers. There were no significant effects on single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin by CYP2C9*3 (1075A > C), CYP3A5*3 g.6986A > G, ABCG2 c.34G > A, SLCO1B1 c.521 T > C, c.388 A > G, g.11187 G > A, c.571 T > C and c.597 C > T. In addition, no difference in rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics was observed among subjects of different genders. We conclude that ABCB1 C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T polymorphism, ABCB1 haplotypes and ABCG2 c.421C > A are determinants of inter-subject variability in rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy Chinese volunteers, and potentially affect the efficacy and toxicity of statin therapy.", 
    "205": "A pharmacokinetic study of simvastatin (single oral dose, 40 mg) was conducted in 17 healthy Chinese volunteers. Plasma concentrations of simvastatin were determined by an LC-ESI-MS-MS method. The pharmacokinetic parameters of simvastatin were derived with a non-compartmental method. The polymorphisms of CYP2C9, CYP3A5, ABCB1 (encoding P-gp), ABCG2 (encoding BCRP) and SLCO1B1 (encoding OATP1B1) were determined by TaqMan genotyping assay and the impacts of these SNPs on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin were analyzed. Major pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows: Tmax 1.44 +/- 0.39 h, Cmax 9.83 +/- 2.41 microg x L(-1), t1/2 4.85 +/- 1.23 h and AUC(0-infinity) 40.32 +/- 6.82 microg x h x L(-1). Effect of ABCB1 G2677T/A SNP on dispostion of simvastatin was observed. Significant differences in t1/2, but not Cmax and AUC(0-infinity), were observed between G/A, G/T or G/G carriers and non-G carriers (5.65 +/- 0.50 h vs 4.41 +/- 1.31 h, P < 0.05). There were no significant effects on simvastatin pharmacokinetics by SNPs such as CYP2C9*3 (1075A > C), CYP3A5*3 g.6986A > G, ABCB1 C3435T, ABCG2 c.34G > A, ABCG2 c.421C>A, SLCO1B1 c.388 A > G, SLCO1B1 c.521 T > C, SLCO1B1 g.11187 G > A, SLCO1B1 c.571 T > C and SLCO1B1 c.597 C > T. We conclude here that there is a small inter-subject variation in simvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy Chinese volunteers. P-gp, OATP1 B1 and BCRP seem unlikely to play an important role in the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin. The gene-dose effects of ABCG2 c.421 C > A and CYP3A5*3 g.6986A > G on simvastatin pharmacokinetics are not strong enough in Chinese subjects.",

We pay particular attention to the specific drug pairing of paroxetine and pravastatin, whose interaction was reported to cause hyperglycemia after the time period of the online logs used in the analysis. We also examine sets of drug pairs known to be associated with hyperglycemia and those not associated with hyperglycemia.

High white blood cell count is a strong and independent predictor of coronary risk in patients of both sexes, with and without coronary heart disease. A high number of white blood cells and their subtypes (for example, neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils) are associated with the presence of coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke. The coronary heart disease risk ratios associated with a high white blood cell count are comparable to those of other inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein. In addition, other components of the complete blood count, such as hematocrit and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, also are associated with coronary heart disease, and the combination of the complete blood count with the white blood cell count can improve our ability to predict coronary heart disease risk. These tests are inexpensive, widely available, and easy to order and interpret. They merit further research."
