Within each group, half of the patients received capsules containing 2.4 g/day of a mixture of EPA and DHA for 6 weeks, while the other half received a mixture of soya and corn oil. After a period of 90 days of washout, the groups were switched, and received the supplementation for 6 weeks more.", 
    "3": "Statins reduced serum LDL and increased SOD expression. n-3 fatty acids increased the plasma malondialdehyde and SOD activity but reduced catalase expression (p<0.05). The interaction involving statins and n-3 fatty acids was nearly significant to the serum triacylglycerol reduction (p=0.054).", 
    "4": "Combining statins and n-3 fatty acids is an excellent strategy to reduce plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentration in women. However, n-3 fatty acids increased the oxidative stress and the pleiotropic effect of statins seemed to be not enough to counterbalance this result. Our data also suggested that the mechanism by which n-3 fatty acids interfere in oxidative stress can be associated with antioxidant enzymes expression and activity.", 
    "5": "The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has been studied for over a hundred years, but so far no consensus on this issue doesn't exist. During this time, experts have gone from ideas of atherogenesis as a consequence of excess cholesterol in the diet to complex theories of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Today generally accepted that one of the major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis is dyslipidemia. When atherogenic dyslipidemia occur expressed disbiotic changes intestine and lead to endotoxemia, bacterial translocation and impaired liver function. The undoubted fact is that the liver plays an important role in the development of atherogenic dyslipidemia, and also is the target organ, which leads to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Currently, NAFLD is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it limits the possibility of adequate lipid-lowering therapy, increasing cardiovascular risk. Therefore, in the treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemia with statins and fibrates useful purpose hepatoprotectors. Choosing hepatoprotectors depends on the stage NAFLD.",

Although the pathogenesis is unknown, we believe the combination of concurrent statin use in the setting of the infection promoted this complication. We describe proposed mechanisms including cytokine activation, alteration of the muscle membrane components, and ionic balance as contributing factors.", 
    "7": "The enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the main site of action of statins, undergoes alternative splicing of exon 13, which encodes the binding domain of statins to the enzyme. The resulting isoform, called HMGCRv1, shows altered enzyme activity and sensitivity to statins compared to the classical isoform. This translates into interindividual differences in the response to treatment with these drugs. A recent discovery in the field of genetics has brought about the identification of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs4363657 of the SLCO1B1 gene located on chromosome 12. This polymorphism is strongly associated with myopathy induced by statins. From the available literature, a clinical study has evaluated the relationship between gene polymorphisms and myopathy during statin therapy. The study involved 12 000 patients treated with simvastatin at a dose of 80 mg/day. The odds ratio for myopathy was 4.5 (95% confidence interval 2.6-7.7) per copy of the C allele, and 16.9 (95% confidence interval 4.7-61.1) in CC as compared with TT homozygotes. Myopathy could be attributed to the C variant in more than 60% of cases. Genomic typing may allow the identification of these variants, leading to a tailored statin therapy with higher benefits to the patients and less adverse side effects.",

In an investigator-initiated, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, patients with ACS were assigned to 40 mg/d of simvastatin + 10 mg/d of ezetimibe (n = 26) or 40 mg/d of simvastatin + placebo (n = 28) administered for 2 months. Markers of coagulation (prothrombin fragments 1.2, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, free tissue factor pathway inhibitor), fibrinolysis [plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, clot lysis time (CLT)], platelet activation (soluble CD40 ligand, \u03b2-thromboglobulin, thromboxane B2), oxidative stress [8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1)], and inflammation (interleukin-6, interleukin-18, and interleukin-1\u03b2) were measured within the first 12 hours of ACS and at 1 and 2 months of therapy. A final analysis comprised 20 patients in the simvastatin + ezetimibe group and 26 patients in the simvastatin + placebo group. Both groups were similar with regard to demographics, risk factors, medications, and routine laboratory results. Inflammatory, coagulation, and platelet markers did not differ between both treatment groups at all time points. Reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, CLT, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 were significantly greater (by 10%, 8.7%, 17.5%, and 22.4%) in the simvastatin + ezetimibe group after 1 month, with further decreases in CLT and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 at 2 months (all P < 0.05). These changes were not associated with lipid and inflammatory parameters. In conclusion, compared with simvastatin alone, simvastatin + ezetimibe results in a greater suppression of oxidative stress and enhanced fibrinolysis in patients with ACS, indicating that ezetimibe might exert cholesterol-independent actions in humans (NCT00725829).",

    "27": "Caspase-3 is a key molecule involved in the inflammation and apoptosis of ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury. Statins are known to inhibit IR injury, but the mechanism of action remains uncertain. In the present study, the effect and underlying mechanism of ischemia alone, and reperfusion with or without atorvastatin (AT) as a timed intervention were examined, since clinically the kidney is only exposed to drug delivery during reperfusion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 45-min clamping of the left renal hilus followed by four hours reperfusion with a right nephrectomy. AT 10 mg/kg was intravenously administered after clamping the renal hilus, but prior to kidney reperfusion. Ischemia alone did cause tubulointerstitial damage (TID), protein carbonylation and caspase-3 activation with an increase in 12 kDa subunit, while reperfusion further enhanced TID, monocyte (ED-1+ cell) infiltration, apoptosis and necrosis together with caspase-3 activity and 17 kDa subunit, but reversed protein carbonylation. AT significantly reduced TID (26%), ED-1+ cell infiltration (74%), tubular apoptosis (47%) and necrosis (73%), and interstitial apoptosis (64%), as well as caspase-3 activity (26%), but did not change serum creatinine and cholesterol. Importantly, without affecting either caspase-3 active protein cleavage or S-nitrosylation, AT directly inhibited caspase-3 active enzyme in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. In conclusions, IR and AT exerted opposing effects on caspase-3 activity by differing mechanisms, with IR stimulating caspase-3 proteolytic cleavage and AT inhibiting active caspase-3 enzyme. This new inhibitory mechanism of AT may improve reperfusion tolerance in ischemic kidneys and benefit transplant recipients.", 
    "28": "Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune prothrombotic disorder characterised by the predisposition to venous and/or arterial thrombosis and obstetric morbidity. Management of APS centres on attenuating the procoagulant state whilst balancing the risks of anticoagulant therapy. Cases of recurrent thromboses and obstetric complications occur despite optimum therapy. Alternative therapies for refractory cases are subject to disparity among clinicians due to the current lack of clinical evidence present. This review aims to address the current management strategies for refractory thrombotic and obstetric cases and future therapeutic interventions. The role and current clinical evidence of using long term low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as an alternative to warfarin therapy for refractory thromboses is evaluated. Potential alternatives for thromboses including statins, hydroxychloroquine, Rituximab are reviewed as well as the additional avenues to target in the future as the pathogenic mechanisms of APS are unveiled. The optimal management for refractory obstetric APS cases is subject to controversy. This review focuses and assesses the current evidence for the uses of low dose prednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin and hydroxycholoroquine in obstetric cases. The treatment modalities for the management of refractory APS require further clinical evidence.", 
    "29": "Hypercholesterolemia or dyslipidemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and statins (inhibitors of a key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase) are the drugs of choice for decreasing plasma cholesterol. It has been estimated that genetic factors can explain 40%-60% of final cholesterol concentrations and approximately 70% of the efficacy of statin treatment. The gene most often analyzed in the context of statin efficacy is the gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE). This review summarizes evidence of the association between variations in the APOE gene locus and the response of plasma lipids to statin therapy. Although the results are not consistent, carriers of the APOE4 allele seems to be less responsive to statins than carriers of APOE2 and APOE3 alleles. This effect is partially context-dependent (gene-gender interactions; gene-nutrition and gene-smoking interactions have not yet been studied) and the absolute differences vary between different population groups.", 
    "30": "Medical and lifestyle secondary prevention strategies are essential components for reducing cardiovascular risk, irrespective of whether revascularization is performed. In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), recent clinical trials have further clarified the management of lipid optimization, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition, antiplatelet therapy, and diabetes. Still, many questions remain with regard to optimal secondary prevention strategies in patients with CAD. Despite the significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with secondary prevention therapies demonstrated in clinical trials, long-term adherence to these interventions remains relatively low, with reasons being multifactorial. One promising method to improve compliance is the use of trained nurses/case managers to routinely follow medications, and provide both lifestyle and behavioral counseling. Implementation of this strategy led to significant improvements in medication compliance and risk factor optimization, although these results require confirmation in a randomized clinical study. Given that poor compliance has been associated with worsening cardiovascular outcomes, effective CAD management should include strategies for improving patient adherence to therapies that have proven benefits.", 
    "31": "We determined the effect of atorvastatin on myocardial apoptosis and caspase-8 activation following coronary microembolization (CME) in a rat model. For this, 50 rats were randomly and equally divided into CME; sham-operated (control); atorvastatin lavage; gastric lavage control; and caspase-8 inhibitor (CHO) groups. In CME animals, a microembolization ball was injected through the left ventricle. Sham animals were injected with normal saline (NS). Atorvastatin group received atorvastatin gastric lavage once-a-day, 1 week before surgery. Gastric lavage controls had similar lavage with NS. CHO group was i.p-injected (CHO: 10 mg/kg) 30 min before surgery. Cardiac indices in each group were determined by echocardiography 6-h postoperatively. TUNEL assay and western blot were used for myocardial apoptosis and expression of caspases-3/-8, respectively. Echocardiography data show that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in CME group was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) compared with sham controls. Besides, left ventricular fractional shortening (FS) and cardiac output (CO) were also decreased with an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDd). Atorvastatin and CHO animals had significantly improved (P < 0.05) cardiac function compared with CME group. Myocardial apoptosis and activation levels of caspases-3/-8 were significantly increased (P < 0.05) compared with sham; myocardial apoptosis and activation levels of caspases-3/-8 were significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in atorvastatin and CHO groups compared with CME group. In conclusion, atorvastatin pretreatment suppressed post-CME myocardial apoptosis and improved cardiac function through the blockade of a myocardial death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway.", 
    "32": "Dyslipidemia is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population, and the cardioprotective role of statins is well established. However, although cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the role of statin therapy is still under investigation. In CKD the atherosclerotic burden is high and pathophysiology of dyslipidemia is complex; however, the majority of large-scale statin trials excluded patients with CKD. Statins could have different effects in the different stages of CKD. Two large trials involving haemodialysis patients showed unfavourable results, whereas in renal transplant subjects as well as in early CKD subjects, statins reduced cardiovascular risk. The studies involving early CKD patients are post-hoc analyses of large trials and they showed that statins are more effective in secondary than in primary prevention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of statins for prevention of cardiovascular events by calculating the number of patients needed to be treated in different interventional trials. We conclude that dyslipidemia is a modifiable cardiovascular risk and statins appear to be an effective treatment especially in the early stages of CKD. Patients on renal replacement therapy could obtain an advantage from this treatment; however, the patient's clinical prognosis should be taken into account when evaluating treatment.",

We estimated complexity by measuring the number of medications, prescribers, pharmacies, pharmacy visits, and refill consolidation (a measure of the number of visits per fill) during the 3 months from the first prescription. The number of daily doses was also measured in ACEI/ARB users. After this period, adherence was evaluated over the subsequent year.

However, the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on ABCA1 in the liver and the precise mechanisms of their actions have been obscure. The aims of this study were to determine whether statins (atorvastatin (Ato) and pitavastatin (Pit)) affect hepatic ABCA1 expression and to clarify the mechanisms of their actions using HepG2 cells and the rat liver. We examined alterations in mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. In vitro and in vivo studies suggested that Pit increases ABCA1 mRNA level, but not Ato. Pit greatly increased Abca1 mRNA level and also increased the amount of plasma HDL and the mRNA level of PPAR\u03b1. Clofibrate (PPAR\u03b1 agonist) increased ABCA1 expression in HepG2 cells and rat primary hepatocytes more than did PPAR \u03b2/\u03b4 and \u03b3 agonists. Pit-induced ABCA1 expression alteration was blocked by GW6471 (PPAR\u03b1 antagonist) and by PPAR\u03b1 knockdown. In this study, we demonstrated that Pit affect ABCA1 expression via PPAR\u03b1 in hepatocytes. The strategy to target a PPAR\u03b1 agonist in the liver can lead to increases in ABCA1 expression and HDL level.",

In vitro studies have demonstrated that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have activity against several pathogenic moulds including Zygomycetes and Aspergillus spp. The aim of our study was to determine if statin use is a preventive factor for the development of IMI. This was a retrospective case-control study of 10 United States Veterans Affairs Medical Centers that comprise the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 16. Cases with IMI and controls were identified from 2001 to 2008. Controls were matched by age, facility, history of transplantation, presence of chronic steroid use and presence of human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV). Two hundred and thirty-eight patients were included. Independent variables associated with the development of IMI were history of solid malignant tumours (OR 2.63, 1.41-4.87) and hypertension (OR 2.29, 1.13-4.68). Statin use within 3 months of index date was not an independent variable for prevention or development of IMI. No level of exposure to a statin drug appeared to influence the development of infection. This retrospective case-control study suggests that despite evidence of in vitro activity, statins may not decrease risk of IMI. Prospective, controlled trials may be necessary to investigate any potential clinical benefit.",

Because these drugs have modest benefits, various alternative drug therapies have been of interest. Drugs with vasodilator activity were originally tried in dementia when it was hypothesized that the condition was due to cerebrovascular insufficiency. Isoxsuprine and ergoloid mesylates are FDA approved for the treatment of dementia, although they have limited evidence of benefit and are rarely used. The hypothesis that free radicals may initiate and maintain mechanisms responsible for neurodegeneration in dementia has stimulated interest in investigating various antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drugs. There is no evidence that other drug therapies, including vitamin E, selegiline, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statin drugs, omega-3 fatty acids, estrogen or combined estrogen plus progestin therapy, or B vitamins, are sufficiently effective and safe to justify their clinical use for the treatment of dementing disorders.",

In an attempt to further improve postischemic tissue repair, we investigated the effect of a local administration of MSC, in the presence or not of low-dose simvastatin, on angiogenesis and functional recovery in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia. In vitro, the proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and tube formation of bone marrow MSC derived from transgenic mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were detected in the presence or not of 0.01 \u03bcmol/l simvastatin, respectively. In vivo, immediately after hindlimb ischemia, the mice were divided into four groups, namely control, MSC, statin, and statin-MSC, and received a single local injection of MSC (2\u00d710(6) cells) and/or a repeated gavages' administration of simvastatin (0.2 mg/kg) for 21 days. The blood flow was measured by laser Doppler imaging, the capillary density was detected by alkaline phosphatase staining and, the MSC differentiation was assessed by immunofluorescent staining at 21 days after the ischemia. In vitro, the MSC proliferation rate, migration ability and tube formation number were increased significantly in simvastatin group relative to control group. Whereas, the H2O2 induced-apoptosis was inhibited significantly in simvastatin group relative to control group. In vivo, hindlimb blood reperfusion was significantly improved (MSC 0.55\u00b10.08, statin 0.57\u00b10.05, vs. control 0.47\u00b10.07, P<0.05) and capillary density was obviously higher at day 21 post-ischemia by Laser Doppler Imaging in the MSC group and the Statin group when compared with control group. The combined use of statin and MSC further improved revascularization (perfusion ratio of 0.70\u00b10.09; P<0.001 verse other groups) and resulted in the highest capillary density (P<0.05 vs. all other groups). GFP-labeled transplanted cells were more frequently observed in the Statin-MSC group than in the MSC group (6.8\u00b10.5-3.1\u00b10.7, P<0.05). Low-dose simvastatin could act in a synergistic way with MSC to potentiate the functional neovascularization in a mouse model of hind limb ischemia.",

The highest quintile of BMI was associated with a fivefold risk of TKR compared with the lowest (8% vs 1.6%), and severe HOA had a 2.4 fold risk compared with those with no HOA (8% vs 3.3%). There was no statistical interaction between BMI and HOA. Thus, individuals with BMI<23.5 with no evidence of HOA had a prevalence of TKR of 1.1%, while those with BMI>30.3 and severe HOA had a prevalence of 13.4%.",

Compounds that demethylate tumour suppressor genes and induce differentiation of cancer cells, but do not have toxic side effects, would represent an exciting option in cancer therapy. Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs with an excellent safety profile and associated with a reduced incidence of various cancers including colorectal cancer (CRC). The authors have previously shown that statins act by activating tumour suppressive bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling in CRC, increasing expression of BMP2. BMP2 is silenced by hypermethylation in gastric cancer.",

The effect of statins was confirmed in a xenograft mouse model. Results BMP2 is silenced by promoter hypermethylation in cell lines with the hypermethylator phenotype and in primary tumours. Treatment with lovastatin downregulates DNMT activity, leading to BMP2 promoter demethylation and to upregulation of expression of BMP2 as well as other genes methylated in CRC. Statins alter gene expression, indicating a shift from a stem-like state to a more differentiated state, thereby sensitising cells to the effects of 5-fluorouracil. In a xenograft mouse model, simvastatin treatment induces BMP2 expression, leading to differentiation and reduced proliferation of CRC cells.",

Incident cerebrovascular events were defined as nonfatal (hospitalized stroke, carotid endarterectomy) and fatal (stroke death) events after dialysis initiation. With Cox proportional hazards regression analysis accounting for the competing risk of nonstroke death, we assessed the independent event risk associated with baseline levels of multiple inflammatory markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-3 [MMP-3], and P-selectin) and hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) use, which may have pleiotropic inflammatory effects.",

However, no strongly effective inhibitors of class II HMGR have been found so far. In the present study, for the first time, four annonaceous acetogenins (ACGs) were explored for the inhibition on S. pneumoniae HMGR. The results showed that the ACGs had higher inhibitory activities against S. pneumoniae HMGR with K(i) values in the range of 6.45-20.49 \u03bcM than the statin drug lovastatin (K(i)=116.25 \u03bcM), a classical inhibitor of class I HMGR.

    "64": "A rapid, simple and accurate method was developed for the determination of chamaechromone in rat plasma using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Rosuvastatin was used as the internal standard. The plasma samples were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. Chromatographic separation was performed on Xbridge\u2122 C(18) column (2.1mm\u00d750mm, 3.5\u03bcm) with linear gradient elution using water and methanol, both of which were acidified with 0.1% aqueous formic acid. The flow rate was 0.4mL/min and the total run time was 6min. Detection was performed on a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer using positive ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI) in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MS/MS ion transitions monitored were m/z 543.3\u2192198.9 and 481.9\u2192258.3 for chamaechromone and rosuvastatin, respectively. Good linearity was observed over the concentration range of 8-6400ng/mL in 0.1mL of rat plasma. The lowest concentration (8ng/mL) in the calibration curve was estimated as LLOQ with both deviation of accuracy and RSD of precision <20% (n=6). Intra-assay and inter-assay variability were less than 11% in plasma. This method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of chamaechromone in rats after intravenous (5mg/kg) and oral (100mg/kg) administration. Following oral administration the concentration-time curve of chamaechromone exhibited a biphasic absorption profile. The maximum mean concentration in plasma (C(max), 795.9\u00b114.6ng/L) was achieved at 11.3\u00b10.8h (T(max)) and the area under curve (AUC(0-60)) was 6976.7\u00b11026.9ngh/L. After single intravenously administration of chamaechromone, the essential pharmacokinetic parameters C(max), AUC(0-48) were 4300.7\u00b1113.6ng/L and 3672.1\u00b1225.4ngh/L, respectively.

The model was evaluated on primary human hepatocytes and parameter identifiability analysis was performed under multiple experimental constraints. Dynamic simulations of atorvastatin biotransformation considering the inter-individual variability of the two major involved enzymes CYP3A4 and UGT1A3 based on quantitative protein expression data in a large human liver bank (n = 150) highlighted the variability in the individual biotransformation profiles and therefore also points to the individuality of pharmacokinetics.",

The model comprises kinetics for transport processes and metabolic enzymes as well as population liver expression data allowing us to assess the impact of inter-individual variability of concentrations of key proteins. Application of computational tools for parameter sensitivity analysis enabled us to considerably improve the validity of the model and to create a consistent framework for precise computer-aided simulations in toxicology.", 
    "68": "Myalgias are the most common side effect of statin use and the commonest cause for discontinuing therapy. Vitamin D has known physiologic functions in muscle and vitamin D deficiency is known to cause myalgias, with its correction leading to disappearance of muscle symptoms. The 521T>C SLCO1B1*5 gene polymorphism decreasing function in the gene coding for a liver anion transporter that is responsible for statin uptake has been found to explain the majority of statin-associated muscle symptoms. Patients with statin-associated myalgias have been reported to improve with vitamin D supplementation. We therefore investigated (i) whether repletion of vitamin D in deficient patients with myalgias could lead to tolerance for subsequent statin therapy and (ii) whether vitamin D status modifies the effect of the SLCO1B1*5 genotype on myalgia risk. Using a retrospective cohort of 64 patients in whom 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] had been measured for any reason while on statin therapy, including 46 patients who consented to be genotyped, we found strong evidence showing that repletion of vitamin D in vitamin D deficient patients improved myalgias. Of 21 vitamin D deficient patients with intolerable statin-associated myalgias, 14 of 15 rechallenged with statins were subsequently symptomfree, with one patient experiencing mild and tolerable symptoms, far exceeding expected rates of acquired tolerability with no therapy (p = 0.01). In addition, while the SLCO1B1*5 genotype was associated with a three-fold increased risk of myalgias (p = 0.07), this risk was not found to differ by vitamin D status (p = 0.60).", 
    "69": "There is growing evidence that vitamin D deficiency significantly increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events and that a vitamin D status representing sufficiency or optimum is protective. Unfortunately, in clinical trials that address interventions for reducing risk of adverse cardiovascular events, vitamin D status is not generally measured. Failure to do this has now assumed greater importance with the report of a study that found rosuvastatin at doses at the level used in a recent large randomized lipid lowering trial (JUPITER) had a large and significant impact on vitamin D levels as measured by the metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The statin alone appears to have increased this marker such that the participants on average went from deficient to sufficient in two months. The difference in cardiovascular risk between those deficient and sufficient in vitamin D in observational studies was similar to the risk reduction found in JUPITER. Thus it appears that this pleiotropic effect of rosuvastatin may be responsible for part of its unusual effectiveness in reducing the risk of various cardiovascular endpoints found in JUPITER and calls into question the interpretation based only on LDL cholesterol and CRP changes. In addition, vitamin D status is a cardiovascular risk factor which up until now has not been considered in adjusting study results or in multivariate analysis, and even statistical analysis using only baseline values may be inadequate.",

This review evaluates data regarding statin use in vascular and noncardiac surgery, the use of statins in combination with \u03b2-blockers in the perioperative period, perioperative statin use in patients already treated with statins, and the safety of statin therapy in the perioperative period. Current recommendations state that patients who are prescribed statins as chronic therapy should continue treatment in the perioperative period, but data suggest that there may be benefit from the use of perioperative statins in a wider population.",

We studied the association between detection of AF after discharge and the risk of recurrent stroke. We followed a prospectively assembled cohort of patients hospitalized for stroke for 1 year for new diagnoses of AF and recurrent stroke. We compared rates of recurrent stroke in patients with a new diagnosis of AF and those without a new diagnosis of AF after discharge using Kaplan-Meier survival statistics. We conducted Cox proportional hazards analysis of the diagnosis and timing of AF and recurrent stroke after adjustment for age, sex, race, preexisting AF, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, previous stroke, and use of antithrombotic and statin medications. Among 5575 patients with stroke, 113 (2.0%) received a new diagnosis of AF after discharge, and 221 (4.0%) had recurrent stroke. At 1 year, the Kaplan\u2012Meier rate of recurrent stroke was 18.9% in those with a new diagnosis of AF and 4.5% in others, including those with AF diagnosed before or during the index hospitalization (P = .001). The association between a new diagnosis of AF and stroke recurrence persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (hazard ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 3.4-9.1). A new diagnosis of AF after discharge for stroke is associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke, even compared with patients with known AF. These findings identify a subset of patients at high risk for recurrent stroke and highlight the importance of timely detection of AF in patients with stroke.",

    "82": "Seven patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and eight patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia underwent determination of 27-hydroxylation rates in vivo by i.v. infusion of deuterated 27-hydroxycholesterol. Isotope enrichment was assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, allowing to calculate 27-hydroxycholesterol appearance rates. Six normocholesterolemic subjects were regarded as controls. In some hypercholesterolemic patients the infusions were repeated during treatment with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. Hydroxylation rates were higher in hypercholesterolemic patients (8.7 \u00b1 2.5 mg/h; controls, 3.4 \u00b1 2.0 mg/h; combined hyperlipidemia, 4.4 \u00b1 1.6 mg/h; mean \u00b1 SD, P < 0.01 vs both).

The correlation with cholesterol levels supports the view that 27-hydroxylation may act as a compensatory mechanism in a condition of larger plasma cholesterol pool.

These data prompt novel pharmacological approaches for the management of hypercholesterolemia and the prevention of atherosclerosis.", 
    "84": "Statins decrease postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) if given before cardiac surgery. However, whether early administration of statins after surgery decreases the risk of postoperative AF is unknown. The association of early reinstitution of postoperative statin therapy within 48 hours to the occurrence of postoperative AF was studied in propensity-adjusted analyses of 200 consecutive patients in sinus rhythm who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting with or without valve surgery. Postoperative AF occurred in 36 patients (18%). Of 52 patients who received a statin early after surgery, 4 (7.7%) developed AF compared to 32 (28%) of 148 patients who did not (p = 0.043). In the propensity-adjusted analyses, early postoperative statin treatment was associated with a significantly lower occurrence of AF (odds ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.99), irrespective of concomitant \u03b2-blocker therapy. The length of stay was shorter for the patients who received early postoperative statins (median 6.1 days, interquartile range 4 to 7, vs 7.8 days, interquartile range 5 to 8; p = 0.0031). In conclusion, of preoperative statin users undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with or without valve surgery, early postoperative reinstitution of statins was associated with a lower occurrence of postoperative AF and a shorter length of stay. Early postoperative statin therapy might be a feasible and safe method of reducing postoperative AF.", 
    "85": "Long-term data on the effects of cholesterol-lowering regimens on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and cardiovascular events in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are lacking. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of long-term intensive lipid-lowering therapy on the natural history of FH. Of approximately 1,000 adult patients with heterozygous FH treated from 1974 to 2008, the charts of 327 were randomly selected for review. FH was defined according to the Simon Broome Registry Group criteria. The recorded data included age; gender; lipid levels with diet only, with each lipid-lowering regimen, and at the most recent visit during treatment; the length of follow-up; cardiovascular events; and revascularization procedures. The lipid assay calibrations and standardization were unchanged throughout the study period. Of the 327 patients, 60% were men, the mean age at diagnosis was 38 \u00b1 14 years, and the mean follow-up was 15 \u00b1 8 years. The baseline and most recent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during treatment were 256 \u00b1 60 mg/dl and 116 \u00b1 46 mg/dl, respectively, for a mean reduction of 55% from baseline (p <0.0001). At their most recent visit, 24% of all subjects were treated with statin monotherapy, 55% with a statin plus another agent, and 21% with triple therapy; 44% received a statin-ezetimibe combination. The interval between recurrent cardiovascular events tended to increase from 5.3 \u00b1 4.8 years before treatment to 7.4 \u00b1 6.7 years after referral (p = 0.1303). In conclusion, advances in drug therapy during the past 3 decades has led to substantial reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and appears to diminish the cardiovascular risk in patients with FH.", 
    "86": "Despite the use of statin therapy and achieving the target for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a substantial number of coronary events are not prevented, and residual risk factors remain unsettled. Recently, ezetimibe has been shown to reduce not only low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but also triglyceride (TG) levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations of residual risk factors, mainly hypertriglyceridemia, with endothelial function during statin therapy in patients with coronary heart disease and examine the effect of ezetimibe add-on therapy. A total of 109 consecutive patients with coronary heart disease during statin therapy were enrolled. Lipid profile was measured and endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery in a fasting state. Next, 32 patients with high TG levels (\u2265150 mg/dl) were prospectively assigned to the ezetimibe add-on group or the no-ezetimibe group, and endothelial function was assessed after 3 months. Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that serum TG and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were independent determinants of percentage FMD (\u03b2 = -0.210 and 0.208, respectively, p <0.05). In patients with high TG levels, ezetimibe add-on therapy significantly improved percentage FMD (from 3.3 \u00b1 1.1% to 4.0 \u00b1 1.1%, p <0.005), whereas no significant change was observed in the no-ezetimibe group. Moreover, the improvement in percentage FMD was significantly associated with reduction in serum TG levels (\u03b2 = -0.387, p <0.05) independent of the change in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In conclusion, hypertriglyceridemia is independently associated with endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary heart disease during statin therapy. Ezetimibe add-on therapy improves endothelial function in these high-risk populations.",

Another 80-year-old Chinese woman with FH, mild vascular dementia and hypertension was hospitalized with bilateral lower limb weakness associated with raised CK (8869 IU/L), lactate dehydrogenase (1384 IU/L) and ALT (288 IU/L) after taking diltiazem 60 mg twice daily with simvastatin 40 mg for 11 months. Statin-associated myopathy was suspected and simvastatin was stopped in both cases, and symptoms resolved and all laboratory parameters returned to normal in 2 weeks. The myopathy in both cases is likely to have resulted from an interaction of higher doses of simvastatin with diltiazem through inhibition of CYP3A enzymes and drug transporters. The strength of simvastatin-diltiazem interactions in the two cases estimated by the Drug Interaction Probability Scale (DIPS) indicated a possible association.",

    "94": "In addition to cholesterol-lowering effect, HMG-CoA reductase inhibition by statins has been shown to have protective effect in many cells type. The loss of vision in retinal degeneration disease associates with oxidative stress and apoptosis in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell. This study was designed to examine the effect of statins on oxidant-induced damage in human RPE cells. Cultured human ARPE-19 (ARPE) cells were challenged with hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) plus tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) in the presence or absence of statins or various stress signaling inhibitors, including anti-oxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI), and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) inhibitor SB203580. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL analysis and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H(2) DCFH-DA). Expression of p-p38 MAPK protein was measured by Western blot analysis. Our findings indicate that statins treatment significantly suppressed oxidant-induced ROS accumulation and RPE apoptosis. Statins increased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, statins treatment prevented the activation of NADPH oxidase and p38 MAPK signaling induced by oxidative stress. These results suggest that statins protects ARPE cells from oxidative stress via an NADPH oxidase and/or p38 MAPK-dependent mechanisms, which may contribute to statins-induced beneficial effects on RPE function.", 
    "95": "Although evidence from epidemiological studies examining a relationship between cholesterol level and stroke is less than definitive, there is a compelling evidence from the clinical therapy trials primarily designed to examine the coronary benefits of statins that statin therapy also causes a reduction in the risk of stroke. Even though a stroke does not have the same exact pathophysiology as a heart attack, specific trials in stroke patients confirm advantages and risks of statin therapy in this kind of population. In primary prevention, statins are effective both when low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is raised and when hs-CRP is elevated. In secondary prevention, an absolute reduction of recurrent stroke can be obtained with statins, with a number needed to treat at 5 years of 45.", 
    "96": "Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Evidence is less robust for the effect of reduction of triglyceride levels and increase of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. In spite of the decrease of cardiovascular events in trials of LDL cholesterol-lowering medications, considerable residual risk remains, even with the use of high-dose statins. The fibric acid derivatives or fibrates reduce triglyceride and increase HDL cholesterol levels, effects that would be expected to affect cardiovascular events. However, clinical outcomes trials with fibrates have shown mixed results. Post-hoc analyses of fibrate trials as well as several meta-analyses suggest an overall decrease in primarily non-fatal coronary events without decrease in total mortality. The effects are most apparent in patients with elevated triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol levels. Statin therapy is the treatment of choice for most patients with dyslipidemia. The addition of a fibrate appears to be most beneficial in high-risk patients who continue to have significant dyslipidemia on statin therapy, most notably patients with diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. Thus, fibrates are not first-line drugs, but they do have a place in the management of the atherogenic lipid profile.",

    "105": "High salt intake (HS) is a risk factor for cardiovascular and kidney disease. Indeed, HS may promote blood-pressure-independent tissue injury via inflammatory factors. The lipid-lowering 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors exert beneficial lipid-independent effects, reducing the expression and synthesis of inflammatory factors. We hypothesized that HS impairs kidney structure and function in the absence of hypertension, and these changes are reversed by atorvastatin. Four groups of rats were treated for 6 wk in metabolic cages with their diets: normal salt (NS); HS, NS plus atorvastatin and HS plus atorvastatin. We measured basal and final body weight, urinary sodium and protein excretion (U(Prot)V), and systolic blood pressure (SBP). At the end of the experimental period, cholesterolemia, creatinine clearance, renal vascular reactivity, glomerular volume, cortical and glomerular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 expression were measured. We found no differences in SBP, body weight, and cholesterolemia. HS rats had increased creatinine clearence, U(Prot)V, and glomerular volume at the end of the study. Acetylcholine-induced vasodilatation decreased by 40.4% in HS rats (P < 0.05). HS decreased cortical and glomerular eNOS and caused mild glomerular sclerosis, interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration, and increased cortical expression of TGF-\u03b21. All of these salt-induced changes were reversed by atorvastatin. We conclude that long-term HS induces inflammatory and hemodynamic changes in the kidney that are independent of SBP. Atorvastatin corrected all, suggesting that the nitric oxide-oxidative stress balance plays a significant role in the earlier stages of salt induced kidney damage.",

We evaluated the growth-suppressive activity of geranylgeraniol in murine B16 melanoma cells. Geranylgeraniol induced dose-dependent suppression of B16 cell growth (IC(50) = 55 \u00b1 13 \u00b5mol/L) following a 48-h incubation in 96-well plates. Cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, manifested by a geranylgeraniol-induced increase in the G1/S ratio and decreased expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4, apoptosis detected by Guava Nexin\u2122 assay and fluorescence microscopy following acridine orange and ethidium bromide dual staining, and cell differentiation shown by increased alkaline phosphatase activity, contributed to the growth suppression. Murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were 10-fold more resistant than B16 cells to geranylgeraniol-mediated growth suppression. Geranylgeraniol at near IC(50) concentration (60 \u00b5mol/L) suppressed the mRNA level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase by 50%. The impact of geranylgeraniol on B16 cell growth, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were attenuated by supplemental mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA reductase that is essential for cell growth. Geranylgeraniol and d-\u03b4-tocotrienol, a down-regulator of HMG-CoA reductase, additively suppressed the growth of B16 cells. These results support our hypothesis that mevalonate depletion mediates the tumor-specific growth-suppressive impact of geranylgeraniol.

Plasma PCSK9 levels were measured in FCHL patients (n=45), NL (normolipidaemic) relatives (n=139) and their spouses (n=72). In addition, 11 FCHL patients were treated with atorvastatin to study the response in PCSK9 levels. PCSK9 levels were higher in FCHL patients compared with NL relatives and spouses: 96.1 compared with 78.7 and 82.0\u00a0ng/ml (P=0.004 and P=0.002 respectively). PCSK9 was significantly associated with both TAG (triacylglycerol) and apolipoprotein B levels (P<0.001). The latter relationship was accounted for by LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-apolipoprotein B (r=0.31, P=0.02), not by VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein)-apolipoprotein B (r=0.09, P=0.49) in a subgroup of subjects (n=59).

In conclusion, plasma PCSK9 is a heritable trait associated with both FCHL diagnostic hallmarks.

To characterize the utility of this approach for detecting genotoxic compounds and identifying the type(s) of DNA damage induced, we evaluated nine of 42 compounds identified as positive for differential cytotoxicity in qHTS (actinomycin D, adriamycin, alachlor, benzotrichloride, diglycidyl resorcinol ether, lovastatin, melphalan, trans-1,4-dichloro-2-butene, tris(2,3-epoxypropyl)isocyanurate) and one non-cytotoxic genotoxic compound (2-aminothiamine) for (1) clastogenicity in mutant and wild-type cells; (2) the comparative induction of \u03b3H2AX positive foci by melphalan; (3) the extent to which a 72-hr exposure duration increased assay sensitivity or specificity; (4) the use of 10 additional DT40 DNA repair-deficient cell lines to better analyze the type(s) of DNA damage induced; and (5) the involvement of reactive oxygen species in the induction of DNA damage. All compounds but lovastatin and 2-aminothiamine were more clastogenic in at least one DNA repair-deficient cell line than the wild-type cells. The differential responses across the various DNA repair-deficient cell lines provided information on the type(s) of DNA damage induced.

The number of apoptotic TUNEL/autophagic LC3 double-positive cells was also significantly decreased with amlodipine or atorvastatin alone compared with vehicle (P < 0.01) and was further decreased by amlodipine plus atorvastatin (P < 0.001). These data suggest additive neuroprotective effects of combination amlodipine and atorvastatin treatment after acute ischemic stroke in MetS model Zucker rats.

    "138": "Introduction: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is prevalent after cardiac surgery and associated with significant morbidity and costs. Statins are commonly used in this population and may be a preventative strategy for PAOF. We wished to examine the effect of preoperative statin use on the risk of POAF after cardiac surgery. Methods: A retrospective, observational study was conducted using data from 489 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at a single institution. Univariate analyses and unconditional logistic regression were used to determine the impact of preoperative statin use on the probability of developing POAF, while controlling for the baseline risk of POAF and the use of amiodarone prophylaxis (AMP). A baseline risk index was calculated for each patient using a previously validated model. Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation or missing data were excluded. Results: Mean patient age was 63 (SD=13) years, 73% were male, 68% underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting, 16% underwent isolated valve surgery, with 13% underwent combined CABG and valve surgeries, and 3% underwent other forms of cardiac surgery. POAF occurred in 27% of patients receiving statins and 24% of those not receiving statins (p=0.3792). After controlling for baseline risk of POAF and the use of AMP, we found that preoperative statins were not associated with reductions in POAF (OR=1.19, 95%CI=0.782-1.822, p=0.4118). Conclusions: Multiple factors impact the development of POAF after cardiac surgery including patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical type, and concomitant medications. In this study, after adjustment for these factors the preoperative use of statins did not significantly influence the development of POAF.", 
    "139": "Randomized multicenter studies in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with chronic proteinuric nephropathies have clearly demonstrated that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) used alone or in combination, effectively retard renal disease progression. Proteinuria reduction, in addition to arterial blood pressure control, largely mediates the nephroprotective effect of RAS inhibitor therapy. Despite RAS inhibition, however, most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This highlights the importance of innovative therapies to halt or revert CKD progression in those at risk. Along this line, a multimodal strategy (Remission Clinic) targeting urinary proteins by dual RAS inhibition with ACE inhibitors and ARBs up-titrated to maximum tolerated doses, by intensified blood pressure control, amelioration of dyslipidemia by statins, smoking cessation and healthy lifestyle implementation was safely and effectively applied at our outpatient clinic to normalize urinary proteins and prevent renal function loss in patients otherwise predicted to rapidly progress to ESRD because of nephrotic-range proteinuria refractory to standard antihypertensive dosages of an ACE inhibitor. This approach achieved remission or regression of proteinuria and stabilized kidney function in most cases, and almost fully prevented progression to ESRD. Provided patients are closely monitored and treatment is cautiously up-titrated according to tolerability, this approach might be safely applied in day-by-day hospital practice. Effective prevention of ESRD would reduce costs of renal replacement therapy by dialysis or transplantation and would be life-saving where these are not available for all patients in need.",

Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase and are an example of a promising cancer chemotherapeutic agent whose clinical usefulness has been limited due to high-dose toxicity. Similarly, erlotinib and gefitinib are anticancer agents that inhibit the activation of individual HER/ErbB receptor subtypes, but have shown limited clinical success because of heterodimerization between different EGF receptor family members that can rescue cancer cells from agents directed against a single receptor subtype. Recent studies have investigated the anticancer effectiveness of low-dose treatment of various statins or EGF receptor inhibitors alone and in combination with \u03b3-tocotrienol on highly malignant +SA mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro. Combined treatment with subeffective doses of \u03b3-tocotrienol with these other chemotherapeutic agents resulted in a synergistic inhibition of +SA cell growth and viability. These findings strongly suggest that combined treatment of \u03b3-tocotrienol with other anticancer agents may not only provide an enhanced therapeutic response but also provide a means to avoid the toxicity, low bioavailability, or limited therapeutic action associated with high-dose monotherapy.", 
    "141": "Given evidence of increasing prevalence in developed and developing countries, as a result of obesity trends and sedentary lifestyles, the metabolic syndrome represents an increasing burden on healthcare systems. Management guidelines for dyslipidaemia have primarily focused on LDL-C reduction; however, this approach fails to sufficiently address other lipid abnormalities associated with the metabolic syndrome. Atherogenic dyslipidaemia (characterized by elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C) is strongly associated with insulin-resistant states, such as type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, and is also a common finding among patients receiving treatment for dyslipidaemia. Intervening against atherogenic dyslipidaemia may address a substantial modifiable fraction of residual cardiovascular risk that remains after treatment with a statin. Recent findings from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study support this view. Fenofibrate treatment was shown to be especially effective in treating marked atherogenic dyslipidaemia, with a significant 27% relative risk reduction for cardiovascular events (P=0.0005, vs. 11%, P=0.035 for all patients) relative to placebo. These data, together with the earlier demonstration of significant microvascular benefits associated with this treatment, suggest a role for fenofibrate, in addition to statin therapy and lifestyle intervention, for reducing global vascular risk in type 2 diabetes patients and for impacting atherogenic dyslipidaemia associated with the metabolic syndrome.",

Maximal superoxide scavenging with polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), 150 U/ml did not influence phenylephrine constrictor responses but potentiated pravastatin's effect, suggesting that the statin did not increase NO bioavailability merely via an antioxidant mechanism. In contrast, pravastatin did not affect endothelin-1 (ET-1) constrictor responses. However, after pre-incubation with a selective endothelin-B (ET(B)) receptor antagonist (BQ788 3 \u00b5mol/L) pravastatin inhibited ET-1 constriction, suggesting that its effect is via the same mechanistic pathway as the ET(B) receptor.",

    "145": "Over the past decade, multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) has become the most reliable and established of the noninvasive examination techniques for detecting coronary heart disease. Now MDCT is chasing intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in terms of spatial resolution. Among the components of vulnerable plaque, MDCT may detect lipid-rich plaque, the lipid pool, and calcified spots using computed tomography number. Plaque components are detected by MDCT with high accuracy compared with IVUS and angioscopy when assessing vulnerable plaque. The TWINS study and TOGETHAR trial demonstrated that angioscopic loss of yellow color occurred independently of volumetric plaque change by statin therapy. These 2 studies showed that plaque stabilization and regression reflect independent processes mediated by different mechanisms and time course. Noncalcified plaque and/or low-density plaque was found to be the strongest predictor of cardiac events, regardless of lesion severity, and act as a potential marker of plaque vulnerability. MDCT may be an effective tool for early triage of patients with chest pain who have a normal ECG and cardiac enzymes in the emergency department. MDCT has the potential ability to analyze coronary plaque quantitatively and qualitatively if some problems are resolved. MDCT may become an essential tool for detecting and preventing coronary artery disease in the future.",

Treatment of osteoporosis in such cases is essentially the same as that for primary osteoporosis, but it is important to be aware of the interference between osteoporosis treatment and the drugs used for the lifestyle-related diseases. Raloxifene, bisphosphonates and activated vitamin D are commonly used for treatment of osteoporosis, and they are reported to have a positive effect on atherosclerosis. Beta-blocker use, particularly selective beta-blocker, is associated with reduced fracture risk. Statin is also reported to stimulate bone formation via bone morphogenetic protein-2 expression, but their clinical utility has not yet been confirmed. One class of antidiabetic drugs, thiazolidinediones, causes bone loss and further increases fracture risk, placing thiazolidinediones in the category of drugs causing secondary osteoporosis.", 
    "147": "Accumulating evidence indicates several drugs for lifestyle-related diseases are involved in bone metabolism. Drugs that might reduce fracture incidence are statins, \u03b2-blockers and thiazide diuretics, and those that might increase fractures are thiazolidinediones and loop diuretics. It is yet controversial whether ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor- II blockers and aldosterone receptor antagonists are indeed involved in the increase or the decrease in fracture incidence.", 
    "148": "Statins are an important part of the treatment plan for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, patients who are prescribed statins often take less than the prescribed amount or stop taking the drug altogether. This suboptimal adherence may decrease the benefit of statin initiation.",

Their model incorporates a Markov model linking adherence to treatment effectiveness and long-term health outcomes. They determine the optimal time of statin initiation that minimizes expected costs and maximizes expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).", 
    "151": "In the long run, approximately 25% of patients remain highly adherent to statins. Based on the MDP model, generic statins lower costs in men and result in a small increase in costs in women relative to no treatment. Patients are able to noticeably increase their expected QALYs by 0.5 to 2 years depending on the level of adherence.", 
    "152": "Adherence-improving interventions can increase expected QALYs by as much as 1.5 years. Given suboptimal adherence to statins, it is optimal to delay the start time for statins; however, changing the start time alone does not lead to significant changes in costs or QALYs.", 
    "153": "Even at low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal, patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. This paper aims (i) to critically appraise evidence for elevated levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) as cardiovascular risk factors, and (ii) to advise on therapeutic strategies for management. Current evidence supports a causal association between elevated TRL and their remnants, low HDL-C, and cardiovascular risk. This interpretation is based on mechanistic and genetic studies for TRL and remnants, together with the epidemiological data suggestive of the association for circulating triglycerides and cardiovascular disease. For HDL, epidemiological, mechanistic, and clinical intervention data are consistent with the view that low HDL-C contributes to elevated cardiovascular risk; genetic evidence is unclear however, potentially reflecting the complexity of HDL metabolism. The Panel believes that therapeutic targeting of elevated triglycerides (\u2265 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL), a marker of TRL and their remnants, and/or low HDL-C (<1.0 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) may provide further benefit. The first step should be lifestyle interventions together with consideration of compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia. If inadequately corrected, adding niacin or a fibrate, or intensifying LDL-C lowering therapy may be considered. Treatment decisions regarding statin combination therapy should take into account relevant safety concerns, i.e. the risk of elevation of blood glucose, uric acid or liver enzymes with niacin, and myopathy, increased serum creatinine and cholelithiasis with fibrates. These recommendations will facilitate reduction in the substantial cardiovascular risk that persists in patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities at LDL-C goal.",

The aim of this study was to investigate whether short-term high-dose atorvastatin load decreases the incidence of CIN after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Statin-naive patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI (n = 241) randomly received atorvastatin (80 mg 12 hours before intervention with another 40-mg preprocedure dose, n = 120) or placebo (n = 121). All patients had long-term atorvastatin treatment thereafter (40 mg/day). Primary end point was incidence of CIN defined as postintervention increase in serum creatinine \u22650.5 mg/dl or >25% from baseline. Five percent of patients in the atorvastatin arm developed CIN versus 13.2% of those in the placebo arm (p = 0.046). In the atorvastatin group, postprocedure serum creatinine was significantly lower (1.06 \u00b1 0.35 vs 1.12 \u00b1 0.27 mg/dl in placebo, p = 0.01), creatinine clearance was decreased (80.1 \u00b1 32.2 vs 72.0 \u00b1 26.6 ml/min, p = 0.034), and C-reactive protein peak levels after intervention were decreased (8.4 \u00b1 10.5 vs 13.1 \u00b1 20.8 mg/l, p = 0.01). Multivariable analysis showed that atorvastatin pretreatment was independently associated with a decreased risk of CIN (odds ratios 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.97, p = 0.043). Prevention of CIN with atorvastatin was paralleled by a shorter hospital stay (p = 0.007). In conclusion, short-term pretreatment with high-dose atorvastatin load prevents CIN and shortens hospital stay in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing PCI; anti-inflammatory effects may be involved in this renal protection. These results lend further support to early use of high-dose statins as adjuvant pharmacologic therapy before percutaneous coronary revascularization.",

Multiple studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome in Germany.Statins remain first-line therapy for the treatment of dyslipidemia. However, despite therapy a relevant cardiovascular risk remains. Therefore, it is important to also aim for an adequate treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and also to raise HDL-levels. Many combination therapies have been shown to be effective in treating dyslipidemia. Adding Omega-3-fatty acids, nicotinic acid/laropiprant or a fibrate to statin monotherapy provide additional beneficial lipid-modifying effects for combined dyslipidemia. In the future a recommendation for the treatment of mixed hyperlipoproteinemia with decreased HDL, raised triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol shall have to be added to our guidelines.",

Of the social surplus generated, the producer appropriated 20-43% of the value during the on-patent period, a figure dropping to 1% following loss of exclusivity. The total producer surplus between 1987 and 2018 is 2-5% of the total social surplus.",

The lipid profiles in TCM were consistent with the underlying pathology of non-atherosclerotic, non-obstructive coronary artery disease. As lipoproteins in most TCM patients were within the optimal range, we recommend an individual assessment of lipid profiles along with their coronary heart disease risk factors for considering long term lipid-lowering therapy. A finding of hyperalphalipoproteinemia or hypotriglyceridemia in 40% of TCM patients is novel but this association needs to be confirmed in future studies with larger sample sizes.

    "186": "Hepatic ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays a key role in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) production by apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) lipidation. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, statins, increase ABCA1 mRNA levels in hepatoma cell lines, but their mechanism of action is not yet clear. We investigated how statins increase ABCA1 in rat hepatoma McARH7777 cells. Pitavastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin increased total ABCA1 mRNA levels, whereas pravastatin had no effect. Pitavastatin also increased ABCA1 protein. Hepatic ABCA1 expression in rats is regulated by both liver X receptor (LXR) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP2) pathways. Pitavastatin repressed peripheral type ABCA1 mRNA levels and its LXR-driven promoter, but activated the liver-type SREBP-driven promoter, and eventually increased total ABCA1 mRNA expression. Furthermore, pitavastatin increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) and its downstream gene expression. Knockdown of PPAR\u03b1 attenuated the increase in ABCA1 protein, indicating that pitavastatin increased ABCA1 protein via PPAR\u03b1 activation, although it repressed LXR activation. Furthermore, the degradation of ABCA1 protein was retarded in pitavastatin-treated cells. These data suggest that pitavastatin increases ABCA1 protein expression by dual mechanisms: SREBP2-mediated mRNA transcription and PPAR\u03b1-mediated ABCA1 protein stabilization, but not by the PPAR-LXR-ABCA1 pathway.
