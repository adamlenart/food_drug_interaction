Three prenyl transferase enzymes have been identified so far. In this paper we report the presence of two prenyl transferases in the HaCaT human keratinocyte cell line. Chromatography of a cytosolic extract from these cells resolved a farnesyl protein transferase (FPT) and geranylgeranyl protein transferase-I (GGPT-I) whose activities were measured using a novel peptide-based assay. Both enzymes were inhibited dose dependently by zaragozic acids A and C. Zaragozic acid C was more active towards the FPT than GGPT-I while zaragozic acid A inhibited both enzymes with similar potency. Incubation of HaCaT cell homogenates with [3H] prenyl precursors resulted in the labelling of a number of proteins which was increased when the cells were pretreated with an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase. Given the role of prenylated proteins in proliferative and inflammatory processes, our finding that prenyl transferases capable of prenylating endogenous substrates are also present in keratinocytes suggests that these enzymes might provide novel therapeutic targets of dermatological importance.", 
    "1": "An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for sensitive and specific determination of pravastatin (PS) sodium, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Preparation of immunogens to obtain antisera was carried out using chemically modified PS; beta-alanine derivative of PS (for ELISA-1) and 5-deoxy- PS (for ELISA-2) were linked to bovine serum albumin via its terminal carboxylic acid by the N-succinimidyl ester method, to avoid intramolecular lactonization of PS. Enzyme-labeled antigens were prepared similarly by coupling with horseradish peroxidase, and were used by homogeneous combination of antisera. The enzymic activity was determined using a microtiter plate coated with second antibody and tetramethylbenzidine as a chromogenic substrate. Both of the ELISA systems enabled the determination of PS in a range of 5 to 500 pg/well, with an IC50 of 36 to 130 pg/well. Cross-reactivties with main metabolites in plasma, which differed from PS in decaline moiety, were less than a few percent. When ELISA-1 was applied to the determination of PS in human plasma directly after dilution with the ELISA buffer, the detection limit and the intra-assay coefficient (5 ng/ml of PS) were 500 pg/ml and 4.5%, respectively. Further, ELISA-1 was validated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with the determination of PS in human plasma after oral administration at a dose of 10 mg/body.", 
    "2": "The relaxation of aortic rings in response to acetylcholine (ACh) was significantly decreased in cholesterol-fed mice. The attenuated relaxation in cholesterol-fed mice was preserved by the chronic administration of prazosin (20 mg/kg/day) or pravastatin (12.5 mg/kg/day). Serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were significantly increased in mice given cholesterol. The increased serum LDL levels in cholesterol-fed mice were returned to normal by the chronic administration of prazosin and pravastatin. A prior incubation of aortic rings with lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) significantly attenuated ACh- and A23187-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation. The inhibitory effects of LPC on endothelium-dependent relaxation were not affected by indomethacin or superoxide dismutase. The sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation of aortic rings was not changed by LPC. The inhibitory effects on ACh-induced relaxation by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine were restored by a prior exposure to L-arginine, whereas the inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation by LPC was not affected by L-arginine. These results suggest that cholesterol-fed mice are useful animal models of hypercholesterolemia, and chronic administration of prazosin or pravastatin can preserve endothelium-dependent relaxation by lowering serum LDL in these animals. It is further suggested that LPC derived from oxidized LDL may be involved in the reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation in hyperlipidemia.", 
    "3": "Selenocysteine tRNA[Ser]Sec isoacceptors contain the modified nucleotide i6A immediately 3' to the anticodon. Because synthesis of i6A is expected to be inhibited by lovastatin, the status of tRNA[Ser]Sec isoacceptors was examined in human breast carcinoma cells. As part of the initial characterization of these cells, it was determined that an adriamycin resistant derivative of the MCF-7 cell line exhibited a dramatic increase in the sensitivity to the killing effects of lovastatin relative to the parental MCF-7 cells. When MCF-7Adr cells were incubated with high levels of lovastatin, there was a dramatic perturbation in the distribution of isoacceptors within the selenocysteine tRNA population. Lovastatin may therefore be a useful reagent for both the study of differential killing of drug-resistant tumor cells and selenoprotein biosynthesis.", 
    "4": "Types of growth include embryonic, fetal, neonatal, juvenile and mature. Until full differentiation is achieved, cells grow through proliferation from progenitor cells. At maturity, the cellular genome is fixed with committed patterns of cell cycle duration and adaptation, ranging from static to renewing type 3. The static cell type cannot proliferate and adapts through hypertrophy. The renewing type continuously proliferates even without stimulus. In all cell types the processes of differentiation and proliferation are mutually exclusive. Cellular kinetics involve (a) the duration of the cell cycle, (b) the birth rate of cells, and (c) the growth rate fractions. The duration of the cell cycle is 2-4 days. All growth factors (GF) exert their influence during G1 phase. Release a GF by one cell type can influence the proliferation of another (= paracrine stimulation). At the end of G1 is the point of highest sensitivity to toxicity. Tumor suppressor genes act here through tyrosine phosphorylation. During S, the cell replicates its chromosomes. During G2 the immune surveillance and DNA damage repair mechanisms operate. Injured cells stay here longer enabling repair of their damaged DNA. Cell division involves both nuclear (mitosis) and cytoplasmic (cytokinesis) phases giving rise to 2 new cells. The cell cycle has 2 checkpoints. The first involves the G1-S transition and the second the G2-M transition. The types of cell cycle inhibition include (a) cycle- and phase-specific inhibition; (b) cycle-and nonphase-specific inhibition; (c) noncycle-and nonphase-specific inhibition, and finally (d) noncycle, nonphase-, and nonorgan-specific inhibition. Proliferation is a circadian process and it is stimulated by a variety of stimuli which include (1) interference with hormonal feedback pathways; (2) inhibition of the tissue trophic activity; (3) sustained presence of antigenic substances; (4) tissue ischemia; (5) changes of conditions luminally or on surfaces of tissues; (6) sustained cytotoxicity; (7) cell death; and (8) surgical resection. Proliferation can be arrested through senescence, apoptosis, injury or even during the development of immune cells. In the past, tissue/cell kinetics have been studied by tritiated thymidine histoautoradiography. Recently, monoclonal antibodies to proliferation-associated antigens, have been successfully employed. These antigens are cycle-associated proteins and include (1) PCNA; (2) p53; (3) Ki67; (4) AGNOR; (5) Statin; and (6) BrdU. Practical examples are given comparing PCNA and BrdU markers from 3 tissues, i.e. liver, glandular stomach, and uterus, across 2 or 3 strains of rats. Mean values of labeling indices are cited. Within the PCNA marker, 2 different clones are compared from the glandular stomach of SD rats of 2 different ages. Gender and across species comparisons are also made. All these comparisons denote that in every study where markers are used (a) there is a need for a concurrent study control group of the same age; (b) there is a need for in-house control data for this particular organ by species, strain, gender and age; (c) there is ancillary assessment of the trophic status of the target tissue; (d) there is a need for at least 2 different time points during assessment; (e) there is a need for such proliferation data prior to commencing the 2 year rodent bioassay; and (f) that PCNA is the most reliable and versatile of all markers used, capable of rendering good results even from archival specimens.", 
    "5": "The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S-Studie) has provided proof beyond any doubt that reduction of plasma cholesterol decreases mortality. The enormous rise of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease in both gender calls for preventative measures as an urgent task. With a reduction of cardiac events by 30-40% and of mortality in the same order of magnitude, cholesterol lowering and increase in HDL-cholesterol are most effective measures for the treatment of coronary artery disease. However, not treatment of late stages of the disease, but primary prevention to reduce the incidence of coronary artery disease in this country should be the principle aim. Thus, the international guidelines for the treatment of lipid disorders considering the individual patient's risk profile have been revised.", 
    "6": "The mechanisms by which peroxisome proliferators are able to regulate metabolic processes such as fat metabolism, while at the same time creating an environment for the development of hepatocellular carcinomas, is a central issue in the non-genotoxic carcinogenesis field. The convergence of two members of the steroid receptor family (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, PPAR; and retinoid X receptor, RXR) has provided strong support for an oxidative stress component in this carcinogenesis process, but has yet to define clearly a pathway for the classical tumor promotion events associated with peroxisome proliferation. The findings presented here integrate a third member of the steroid receptor family into this process and suggest a novel autocrine loop and mechanism for creating both oxidative stress and tumor promotion. A central regulatory component in this pathway is farnesol which has recently been shown to induce transcription mediated by the steroid receptor family member, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). In this report, it is clearly demonstrated that farnesol can also upregulate the transcriptional events of PPAR, but most likely through a different farnesoid metabolite, resulting in the regulation of an entirely different set of genetic components. Deregulation of the activities of these receptors offers a provocative mechanism for explaining the hepatocarcinogenic effects of peroxisome proliferators in chronically treated rodents.", 
    "7": "The effects of colestipol therapy alone (20 g/d) or combined with simvastatin (20 mg/d) were examined in a group of eight male patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol > or = 6.5 mmol/L [> or = 250 mg/dL]) who had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting more than 3 months previously. Colestipol therapy decreased total cholesterol by 14% (P < .001) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) by 23% (P < .001), while dual therapy decreased total cholesterol by 38% and LDL-C by 52% (both P < .001 versus baseline). No significant changes were observed in plasma triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol, or HDL cholesterol levels. VLDL subfraction turnovers were conducted at baseline and again on each regimen. ApoB kinetic parameters derived from a multicompartmental model suggested that colestipol therapy resulted in an expansion of the total VLDL apoB pool (36%, P < .05) that was largely due to a fall in the clearance rate of VLDL1 apoB (49%), while the LDL apoB pool decreased 23% as a result of diminished direct LDL input. The model used also revealed that addition of simvastatin to the resin therapy caused increases in the fractional transfer rates of VLDL2 to IDL and IDL to LDL together with a 37% increment in the LDL apoB fractional catabolic rate. Compared with baseline, combined therapy generated falls in both IDL (35%, P = .01) and LDL (37%, P < .04) apoB pools due to enhanced clearance of IDL (214%, P < .03) and reduced total input of LDL (39%, P < .003).", 
    "8": "A review of relevant literature on biological activities of oxysterols (OS) and cholesterol is presented. The data clearly demonstrate manifold biological activities, often detrimental, for OS compared with little or no such activity of a deleterious nature for cholesterol itself. Cholesterol is perhaps the single most important compound in animal tissue and, as such, it is difficult to imagine it as a toxin or hazard. In contrast, OS exhibit cytotoxicity to a wide variety of cells leading to angiotoxic and atherogenic effects; alter vascular permeability to albumin; alter prostaglandin synthesis and stimulate platelet aggregation, an important process facilitating atherosclerosis and thrombosis; alter the functionality of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, possibly stimulating hypercholesterolaemia; modify cholesteryl ester accumulation in various cells, inducing foam cell formation; and enrich the LDL particle in cholesteryl esters, possibly increasing its atherogenicity. Furthermore, OS are mutagenic and carcinogenic, although some have been studied as antitumour agents based on their cytotoxic properties. Moreover, numerous studies have implicated OS in membrane and enzyme alterations that are interrelated with many of the foregoing effects. The authors find that OS deserve much more attention than cholesterol itself in terms of research activity but that unfortunately the reverse is true with regard to funding.", 
    "9": "Malignant gliomas, the most common form of primary brain tumors, are highly dependent on the mevalonate (MVA) pathway for the synthesis of lipid moieties critical to cell replication. Human glioblastoma cells were found to be uniquely vulnerable to growth arrest by lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme regulating MVA synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. The sodium salt of phenylacetic acid (NaPA), an inhibitor of MVA-pyrophosphate decarboxylase, the enzyme that controls MVA use, acted synergistically with lovastatin to suppress malignant growth. When used at pharmacologically attainable concentrations, the two compounds induced profound cytostasis and loss of malignant properties such as invasiveness and expression of the transforming growth factor-beta 2 gene, coding for a potent immunosuppressive cytokine. Supplementation with exogenous ubiquinone, an end product of the MVA pathway, failed to rescue the cells, suggesting that decreased synthesis of intermediary products are responsible for the antitumor effects observed. In addition to blocking the MVA pathway, lovastatin alone and in combination with NaPA increased the expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, a transcription factor implicated in the control of lipid metabolism, cell growth, and differentiation. Our results indicate that targeting lipid metabolism with lovastatin, used alone or in combination with the aromatic fatty acid NaPA, may offer a novel approach to the treatment of malignant gliomas.", 
    "10": "Fasting plasma mevalonic acid (MVA), an indicator of in vivo cholesterol synthesis, was measured in 35 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) of whom 7 were treated with pravastatin 10-40 mg/day, 7 with simvastatin 10-40 mg/day and 21 with atorvastatin 80 mg/day. Reductions in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and MVA on maximal dose therapy differed significantly between the three drugs: 34.7%, 42.9% and 54.0% (P = 0.0001), and 31.6%, 48.9% and 58.8% (P = 0.004), respectively. Patients on atorvastatin were subdivided according to whether their reduction in LDL cholesterol on treatment was above or below the mean percentage change for the whole group. Basal values of LDL cholesterol did not differ significantly, but above average responders had a significantly higher mean pre-treatment level of MVA (6.2 +/- 0.60 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.61 ng/ml, P < 0.05) than below average responders. When all three drug groups were pooled above average responders showed a significantly greater absolute decrease in MVA on treatment than below average responders (3.85 +/- 0.48 vs. 2.33 +/- 0.40 ng/ml, P < 0.05). However, there was no significant correlation between the magnitude of the decreases in LDL cholesterol and MVA. These findings suggest that FH patients who responded well to statins had a higher basal level of plasma MVA, i.e. a higher rate of cholesterol synthesis, which was more susceptible to pharmacological inhibition. The more marked cholesterol lowering effect of atorvastatin 80 mg/day presumably reflects, at least in part, its ability to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase to a greater extent than maximal recommended doses of pravastatin and simvastatin of 40 mg/day.", 
    "11": "Inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis are believed to lower serum cholesterol levels by enhancing the removal of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by increasing hepatic LDL receptor function. Thus, the effects of several different inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis were examined for their effects on the expression of the hepatic LDL receptor in rats. We found that administration of inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase such as lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rivastatin resulted in increased hepatic LDL receptor mRNA levels. Surprisingly, these agents failed to increase levels of immunoreactive LDL receptor protein in rat liver even when the dose and length of treatment were increased. Treatment of rats with zaragozic acid A, an inhibitor of squalene synthase, caused even greater increases in hepatic LDL receptor mRNA levels, but did not increase levels of immunoreactive protein. Further investigation revealed that the rate of degradation of the hepatic LDL receptor was increased in rats given inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. The greatest increase in the rate of degradation was seen in animals treated with zaragozic acid A which caused the largest increase in hepatic LDL receptor mRNA levels. In contrast, hepatic LDL receptor protein was stabilized in cholesterol-fed rats. It appears that increased potential for LDL receptor protein synthesis, reflected in increased mRNA levels, is offset by a corresponding increase in the rate of receptor protein degradation resulting in constant steady-state levels of hepatic LDL receptor protein. These findings are suggestive of increased cycling of the hepatic LDL receptor. This postulated mechanism can provide for enhanced hepatic uptake of lipoproteins without increasing steady-state levels of LDL receptor protein.", 
    "12": "Within the Lovastatin Restenosis Trial, restenosis has been clearly shown to increase resource utilization and costs. While it is not possible to generalize these results to other patient populations, it is clear that successful efforts to decrease restenosis will certainly improve efficacy while decreasing follow-up costs and increasing the cost-effectiveness of intervention in the coronaries.",

    "21": "Lipoprotein deposition and increased intimal proteoglycans are characteristics of the atherosclerotic lesion in which low density lipoproteins (LDL) bind with high affinity to proteoglycans. The affinity of LDL to proteoglycans is dependent on its structural and compositional characteristics. This study investigated the relationship between serum lipid levels and LDL-proteoglycan reactivity. We also analyzed how lipid-lowering drugs affect this interaction. Patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia (n = 147) were randomized to pravastatin 40 mg o.d., gemfibrozil 600 mg b.i.d., gemfibrozil+pravastatin (same doses) or placebo. LDL reactivity with proteoglycans was analyzed by precipitation of serum with isolated human arterial proteoglycans. Reactivity was determined as amount of precipitated cholesterol or apolipoprotein (apo) B. Under the conditions used, 53% of the LDL cholesterol and 29% of serum apo B were precipitated. There were strong correlations between precipitated LDL and serum levels of cholesterol, LDL or apo B. No correlations were found with serum lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels. During pravastatin treatment, cholesterol was reduced by 26.5% and triglycerides by 9.8%. During gemfibrozil treatment corresponding figures were 16.8 and 40.2, and for the combined treatment, 27.5% and 34.2%. On all treatments, the reactivity of LDL with proteoglycan was reduced. The effects were significantly larger in the groups treated with gemfibrozil. This was correlated with the increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) during gemfibrozil treatment. In hypercholesterolemia, the reactivity of LDL with proteoglycan is increased; treatment with lipid-lowering drugs lowers this reactivity, the effect being greatest for gemfibrozil. This might be due to conformational changes of LDL during treatment with gemfibrozil, unrelated to its lipid lowering effect. Since binding of LDL to proteoglycans is central in atherogenesis, this may be of importance for the role of gemfibrozil as an antiatherogenic drug.", 
    "22": "A partial rabbit cDNA clone (14b) for ACAT has been characterized and used to demonstrate that hepatic and aortic ACAT mRNA14b abundance increased 2-3-fold in rabbits receiving a high fat/high cholesterol-diet compared to chow fed animals (Pape et al. (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36, 823-838). Because of those data we hypothesized that increased hepatic cholesteryl ester mass and synthesis rates in rabbit liver cells are associated with an increase in ACAT mRNA14b levels. To test this hypothesis we altered cellular cholesteryl ester mass and synthesis rates in primary parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells using various extracellular agents and measured the accumulated mass of ACAT mRNA14b. Parenchymal cells incubated with rabbit beta VLDL or mevalonolactone displayed a 6-10-fold increase in cellular cholesteryl ester mass over a three day treatment with no significant changes in cellular free cholesterol, triacylglycerols, or ACAT mRNA14b levels; HMG CoA reductase and LDL receptor mRNA mass decreased initially as a result of cholesteryl ester loading. Treatment of parenchymal cells with CI-976, an ACAT inhibitor, showed a marked reduction in cholesteryl ester synthetic rate compared to beta VLDL controls but displayed no change in ACAT mRNA14b levels. A mixed population of rabbit hepatic nonparenchymal cells was incubated with beta VLDL for 24 h in culture which resulted in a 6-fold increase in cellular cholesteryl ester mass; there was no change in ACAT mRNA14b levels. In an in vivo study, rabbits consuming a high fat/high cholesterol-diet for three weeks showed a 10-fold increase in hepatic cholesteryl ester with no significant changes in ACAT mRNA14b levels. Together these data indicate that rabbit liver cellular cholesteryl ester mass increases of up to 10-fold are not correlated with ACAT mRNA14b changes. Thus, hepatic ACAT mRNA14b expression and cellular cholesterol esterification do not appear to be coordinately regulated at this level of cholesteryl ester loading.",

    "25": "Addition of angiotensin II to aortic rings incubated in Krebs' Ringer bicarbonate medium produced tension generation (0.9 +/- 0.12 g = 100%). Treatment of aortic rings with simvastatin inhibited the angiotensin II-induced contraction 58 +/- 0.06%. To evaluate this effect further, dose-response curves with noradrenaline were measured in the presence and absence of 20 micromol/l simvastatin, lovastatin, mevastatin and pravastatin. The results indicate that simvastatin, lovastatin and mevastatin inhibited the contraction induced by noradrenaline (10 micromol/l) by about 50%. Pravastatin did not inhibit aortic ring contraction. Furthermore, the concentration required for 50% of the maximal contraction (EC50) by noradrenaline (6.2 +/- 0.1 nmol/l) was significantly increased by simvastatin, lovastatin, mevastatin and pravastatin. The inhibition of vascular contraction by vastatins appears to involve inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase activity because the inhibitory effect of simvastatin was reduced 50% by 10 mmol/l mevalonic acid. To determine whether the depression of vascular contraction by these agents was correlated with cell calcium changes, the angiotensin II-induced calcium mobilization was determined in Fura-2 loaded cells, before and after treatment with these inhibitors. Simvastatin, lovastatin and mevastatin significantly reduced the angiotensin II-induced calcium mobilization. The concentration that induced 50% inhibition was 3.3 micromol/l for simvastatin, 17.4 micromol/l for mevastatin and 21.7 micromol/l for lovastatin. No effect of pravastatin on calcium mobilization was observed.",

    "27": "The intensive search for inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis by screening culture broths has spanned more than 20 years here at Sankyo. Resulting from our efforts, ML-236B was discovered in Japan as the first potent and specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. This compound contributed-to the Nobel Prize-winning work of Goldstein and Brown in which they elucidated the mechanisms of the LDL receptor pathway. After the discovery of ML-236B, many attempts were performed to find other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and some potent inhibitors including pravastatin have already been launched. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are in worldwide clinical use and play a pivotal role in the therapy of hyperlipidemic patients. Pravastatin is produced by a two-step fermentation, firstly ML-236B is produced by Penicillium citrinum followed by the hydroxylation of ML-236B by S. carbophilus to form pravastatin. Recent advances in the molecular characterization of the Cyt P-450sca-2 and their responsiveness to ML-236B and PB in bacterial cultures should help elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of ML-236BNa and PB induction. In an effort to increase the productivity of this fermentation process, new technologies have been developed, and the mechanism of hydroxylation has been extensively investigated.", 
    "28": "Resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs can not only be caused by treatment with antineoplastic agents but also by radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to analyze whether ionizing radiation can influence the mRNA expression of proteins which have been found to be involved in drug resistance of tumor cells. Human tumor cell lines (MCF-7, LXF and Sk-Mel) were treated with single doses of irradiation (5, 10 and 20 Gy). The expression of the resistance related proteins glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi), topoisomerase II alpha (Topo II), thymidylate synthase (TS), O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), P-glycoprotein (Pgp), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) and also of the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP 70) were determined at the mRNA level during the time interval from 1.5 to 72 h post-irradiation and compared with their corresponding controls. We also examined whether a relationship exists between these proteins and the proliferative activity (histone 3, Ki-67, statin) of the cells. We found that exposure of MCF-7, LXF and Sk-Mel cells to ionizing radiation increases the expression of the mRNA of GST-pi. Topo II, TS, HSP 70 and proliferation markers were also altered by exposure to ionizing radiation, but there was no common response of the three cell lines. No significant changes were observed in the expression of MGMT, Pgp, GPX and MRP after radiation treatment. Drug resistance tests revealed that irradiated MCF 7 cells were less sensitive to doxorubicin than non-irradiated control cells. Our results indicate that ionizing irradiation modifies the expression of some proteins involved in drug resistance and the response of MCF 7 cells to doxorubicin and may, therefore, play a role in clinical drug response.", 
    "29": "We report on 2 children, brother and sister, who presented with cardiomyopathy and muscular hypotonia at the age of B months. They both excreted significant amounts of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (3-HMG) and 3-methylglutaconic acid (3-MGC) but no 3-methylglutaric acid (3-MG). Enzyme analysis in fibroblasts revealed normal activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) lyase and of 3-methylglutaconyl hydratase and other enzymes of 3-HMG metabolism. Loading tests with leucine did not affect the excretion of 3-HMG and 3-MGC. The girl died as a result of her cardiomyopathy, while the boy recovered and was treated with cardiac supportive therapy. He showed a steady improvement during his clinical course with biochemical normalization of the urinary excretion of 3-HMG, concomitant with marked improvement in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In cultured fibroblasts from both patients a reduced activity of complex II/III of the respiratory chain was measured which may be the cause of this new type of 3-HMG uria. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA heart muscle, liver and fibroblast culture of the patient did not reveal any major mitochondrial DNA rearrangements (deletion, duplication) or any point mutation that had been described in association with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy.",

The study aims to test the hypothesis that the long term reduction of serum total cholesterol by pravastatin will lead to a decrease in coronary heart disease (CHD) events. The trial was designed to include a random 6,000 male patients aged 45-74 years with serum total cholesterol of 220 mg/dl (5.69 mmol/l) or greater and without a history of myocardial infarction, coronary surgery or angioplasty, to undertake either pravastatin or conventional treatment (including hypolipidemic drugs other than HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, probucol and bezafibrate), and to follow up each patient for 5 years. Primary endpoints are fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary bypass surgery and angioplasty, cardiac death, and sudden and unexpected death. During the period from May 1990 to September 1993, a total of 5,640 male patients aged 45-74 were recruited by 902 participating physicians throughout Kyushu. Randomization was, however, neglected by study physicians; the numbers of patients enrolled were 3,061 in the pravastatin group and 2,579 in the conventional treatment group. Patients allocated to the pravastatin treatment were generally unfavorable regarding coronary risk factors. Baseline mean levels of serum total cholesterol were 259 mg/dl (6.70 mmol/l) in the pravastatin group and 246 mg/dl (6.36 mmol/l) in the conventional treatment group (p <0.001). Although the trial was regarded as a prospective observational study, the KLIS provides valuable quantitative data regarding cholesterol lowering and reduction in CHD events as well as safety data of the long-term use of a statin in Japanese men with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "31": "The effect of lovastatin, a competing inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) of the fungal origin on the growth of and ergosterol biosynthesis by Rh. rubra VKPM Y 1337 was studied. It was shown that the yeast growth was inhibited by lovastatin in concentrations of 0.25 to 5.0 micrograms/ml when the inhibitor was added to the cultivation medium either with the inoculum or at later periods of the yeast cultivation. In concentrations of 2.0 to 5.0 micrograms/ml lovastatin almost completely inhibited the yeast growth. In the concentrations tested the inhibitor did not decrease the ergosterol level in the yeast cells below 40 per cent of the control. When lovastatin was added in concentrations of 1.0 to 5.0 micrograms/ml the maximum inhibition of the ergosterol biosynthesis was observed at the end of the growth log phase. Further cultivation of the yeast in the presence of the inhibitor resulted in an increase of the ergosterol biosynthesis. It is believed that the increase in the quantity of ergosterol may be due either to the HMG-CoA-reductase induction under the action of the inhibitor or to its inactivation as a result of the hydroxylation.", 
    "32": "Changes in blood lipids were assessed in the course of 4 years in 29 patients with cholesterol (CS) levels at least 300 mg/dl (hyperlipidemia). Of these, 20 received mevacor, 9 were controls. Taking mevacor in a dose 20-40 mg/day for 6 months reduced CS in the study group by 20% and by 10% more within the next 6 months. CS in controls changed unnoticeably. Lowering of the dose to 10-20 mg/day or mevacor discontinuation at the moment CS fell to 250 mg/dl or greater did not entail a rerise of total blood CS within subsequent 4-6 months.", 
    "33": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of pravastatin (Pr) on accelerated coronary arteriosclerosis in transplanted hearts. The rabbit hearts were transplanted to the recipients' neck heterotopically, and received FK506. The rabbits in group 1 were fed a normal diet (ND), and cholesterol-rich diet (CD) in group 2 and 3. Pr (10 mg/kg) was given to group 3. They were sacrificed at 4 weeks and the severity of myocardial rejection and arterio-sclerosis was assessed and scored histologically. The serum lipid levels were significantly elevated by a CD. However, addition of Pr had no effect on the levels of LDL and total cholesterol (TC). There was no significant difference in myocardial rejection in each group. Transplanted hearts in group 2 showed more severe arteriosclerotic lesions than those in group 1. Pr treatment in group 3 diminished the severity of coronary arteriosclerosis. Pr may prevent the accelerated coronary arteriosclerosis after heart transplantation without significant changes in TC and LDL.", 
    "34": "Many studies have found that familial hypercholesterolemia, a hyperlipoproteinemia associated with premature atherosclerosis, is characterized by enhanced platelet aggregation. This study was undertaken to measure the urinary excretion of the two main urinary thromboxane B2 (TXB2) metabolites (2, 3-dinor-TXB2 and 11-dehydro-TXB2) in 20 patients affected by familial hypercholesterolemia treated for one month with 40 mg/day of pravastatin (10 patients) in comparison to 10 normocholesterolemic subjects. After a run-in period, the type II A patients showed total cholesterol levels (296 +/- 32 mg/dL) significantly higher (P < 0.001) than those of control subjects (155 +/- 46 mg/dL). The urinary concentrations of 11-dehydro-TXB2 and 2,3-dinor-TXB2 also significantly differed (P < 0.001) between control group (1,463 +/- 1,440 and 386 +/- 447 pg/mg urinary creatinine) and treated patients (3,536 +/- 2,112 and 914 +/- 572 pg/mg urinary creatinine). At baseline there was a positive correlation between total cholesterol (TC) levels and urinary TXB2 metabolite concentrations (2,3-dinor-TXB2 r = 0.61, P < 0.02; 11-dehydro-TXB2, r = 48, P < 0.05), but not between low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the urinary compounds. At the end of a four-week treatment. TC and LDL-C had decreased significantly from the baseline levels, by 27% and 30% in the fluvastatin group (P < 0.01) and by 23% and 31% in the pravastatin group (P < 0.01), with no significant difference between the two groups. After the two treatments with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, there was no statistically significant reduction of the urinary metabolite levels. In addition, the positive correlation seen at baseline between TC and TXB2 metabolites was no longer present. In accord with previous studies, we found a significant correlation between TC levels and TXB2 metabolites concentrations in type II A hypercholesterolemic patients. Although, short-term treatment with two statins reduced TC levels, it did not change the thromboxane metabolite excretion.", 
    "35": "Tumors derived from the colonic epithelium exhibit cholesterol metabolism which is clearly different from that in fibroblasts, hepatocytes, adrenals, and ovaries. In hepatocytes and fibroblasts MEV inhibition of the rate limiting step in cholesterol synthesis HMG Co A reductase can be overcome by the uptake of LDL. Colon cancer cells however do not overcome MEV inhibition by LDL uptake but rather exhibit further growth suppression Mevinolin (Mevacor), a drug used to lower serum cholesterol levels has the advantage of accumulating in the liver to approximately 95% with the first pass. A small but variable percentage of non-sterol precursors may escape inhibition and be utilized for other pathways in the isoprenylation of certain proteins, among them members of the ras family. Mutated ras, an oncogene, is found in 40-50% of colon tumors and the expression of a functional gene product is dependent on isoprenylation for anchorage to the tumor cell membrane. d-Limonene, a relatively non-toxic monoterpene found in orange skin oil, selectively inhibits isoprenylation and also accumulates to some extent in the liver. It was hypothesized that the differences in mevalonate metabolism between hepatocytes and colon tumor cells could provide a chemotherapeutic advantage in which MEV and/or d-limonene could effectively inhibit cholesterol synthesis and post-translational modification of proteins with non-sterol cholesterol precursors in colon tumor derived hepatic metastases and thus inhibit their growth. Since each drug affects aspects of mevalonate synthesis at different points, the effects of the combination of their agents on inhibiting tumor metastases was investigated to ascertain if these could be additive. In tissue culture, MEV and d-limonene significantly inhibited the growth of CT-26, a murine transplantable colon tumor. Cholesterol synthesis assessed in these cells indicated that in lipid deficient media the following additions-25-hydroxycholesterol, and LDL significantly reduced cholesterol synthesis. Conversely, perillyl alcohol increased cholesterol synthesis 2.5 fold. In cells cultured in FBS based medium, which have an FBS control, MEV treatment reduced cholesterol synthesis to 65% of control. Perillyl alcohol increased synthesis 1.4 fold and when given in conjunction with MEV, it abolished the effects of this inhibitor. In isoprenylation studies of 14C-mevalonate incorporation into proteins, MEV impaired isoprenylation by restricting synthesis of mevalonate derived intermediates. Results of CT-26 treatment with perillyl alcohol are inconsistent with its putative role as a protein isoprenylation inhibitor. The combination of these agents indicates an additive action which requires additional investigation to elucidate their mechanism(s). Dietary MEV and d-limonene were evaluated alone and in combination for their chemotherapeutic potential in a hepatic \"metastasis\" model. Using splenic colonization in which CT-26 was implanted into the spleen and ultimately seeded the liver, each of these compounds were found to inhibit the growth of resultant tumors both alone and in combination by approximately 80% versus controls at 35 days post-implantation. Assessment of HMGCoA reductase in liver and tumor indicated that these agents were effective in reaching these target sites. The findings to date indicate that while d-limonene and MEV may differentially affect the same pathway, and their individual actions may appear antagonistic in vitro, their overall action individually or together, appears promising as a chemotherapeutic modality for the possible management of hepatic metastases from colon cancer.", 
    "36": "In order to determine whether there is a difference in the effect of the hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor pravastatin on cholesterol synthesis between the morning and the evening, we studied the 24-h profile of mevalonate in plasma and urine in 11 subjects with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. In study 1, eight subjects with familial hypercholesterolaemia took pravastatin (20 mg) once in the morning, and another 20-mg dose in the evening after a 1-week wash-out period. In study 2, five subjects with familial hypercholesterolaemia took pravastatin (20 mg per day) in the morning on 3 consecutive days and on 3 days in the evening after a 1 day wash-out. Plasma mevalonate concentrations were reduced at 9 h and 5 h after pravastatin administration in the morning and the evening, respectively. Urinary mevalonate excretion was significantly reduced at 4-8 h after pravastatin administration in the morning (51 vs 19 nmol.h-1) and at 4-16 h after pravastatin administration in the evening (56 vs 27 nmol.h-1). Daily urinary mevalonate excretion was equally and significantly reduced by pravastatin in the morning or evening. In conclusion, we found that morning and evening administration of pravastatin caused equal reductions in plasma and urinary mevalonate concentrations.", 
    "37": "We compared the lipid-lowering effects of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, and gemfibrozil, a fibric acid derivative, in 22 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients whose serum total cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels were > or = 220 mg/dL after a standard diet for six months. The study group was first treated with gemfibrozil (600 mg/b.i.d.) for three months (stage 1). After a wash-out period of two months, during which no treatment was given, all of the patients became hyperlipidemic again and, therefore, were given simvastatin (10 mg/day) for three months (stage 2), which was followed by another two-month wash-out period. A control group, which served to evaluate the natural progression of pharmacologically untreated dyslipidemia, was followed during the same period. Blood determinations of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were performed after each step. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and HDL ratio were calculated from the measured values. Both gemfibrozil and simvastatin improved all parameters of the lipid profile, but the effect of simvastatin was better than that of gemfibrozil (-69 vs -39 mg/dL for triglyceride and -95 vs -64 mg/dL for cholesterol), while their actions on LDL and HDL cholesterol were of equal magnitude. Two months after discontinuation of simvastatin, significant decreases of total cholesterol (-46 mg/dL) and triglyceride (-60 mg/dL) were still present, while these values had returned to pretreatment levels after stopping gemfibrozil. The HDL ratio remained markedlyhigher (p < 0.05) during the wash-out period after simvastatin, while it decreased to pretreatment values after gemfibrozil was stopped. The lipid profile of the control group did not change during the follow-up. Both drugs were well tolerated, and no serious side effects occurred.", 
    "38": "Fluvastatin is a potent synthetic competitive inhibitor of beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway for hepatic cholesterol synthesis. The therapeutic indication is reduction of elevated total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Results from four toxicity studies in beagle dogs and one study in rhesus monkeys following oral administration of fluvastatin are reported. In two 26-week dog studies, doses were 0, 1, 8, or 48 mg/kg/day (reduced to 36 mg/kg/day in Week 7) and 0, 6, 24, or 36 mg/kg/day (reduced to 30 mg/kg/day in Week 2). In a 2-year dog study, doses were 0, 1, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day. Dose levels in the 26-week monkey study were 0, 0.6, 12, and 48 mg/kg/day (raised to 84 mg/kg/day in Week 17 and to 108 mg/kg/day in Week 22). In these studies, evaluations included clinical and physical examinations, body weight and food consumption, electrocardiography, ophthalmoscopy, hematology and clinical chemistries, urinalysis, blood drug concentration, and macroscopic and microscopic examinations of observed lesions and representative tissues. In the 26- and 52-week dog studies and the monkey study, lenticular biochemistry, the HMG-CoA reductase activity of liver microsomes, and serum lipid concentrations were investigated. The fourth dog study was a single-dose toxicokinetic study in which 48 mg/kg [3H]-fluvastatin was monitored for up to 2 weeks. Sampling was limited to ocular tissues for enzyme analysis. Doses of > or = 24 mg/kg/day were lethal in dogs. At lethal doses, ataxia, convulsions, fecal blood, multifocal congestion and hemorrhage, isolated foci of malacia in the medulla oblongata, and liver necrosis were observed. Reduced weight gain, emesis, cataracts, elevated liver enzymes, reduced cholesterol, and gallbladder inflammation with mucosal hyperplasia occurred at > or = 8 mg/kg/day. In contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fluvastatin did not cause significant central nervous system hemorrhage or testicular changes in dogs. Monkeys tolerated exposure to fluvastatin well with only mild gallbladder changes observed. Reduced serum cholesterol and slight hyperplasia of the gallbladder mucosa occurred in the 12 and 48/84/108 mg/kg/day groups.", 
    "39": "To investigate the effect of endogenous cholesterol synthesis on blood pressure and vascular response, a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin (1 or 10 mg/kg per day) was administered orally for 2 or 4 weeks to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR/lzm) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY/lzm) rats. Blood pressure was significantly increased in the pravastatin-treated groups of both strains, occurring in WKY after a longer treatment period than in SHR. The thoracic aortas from SHR and WKY were pretreated with pravastatin (10(-4)M). The vascular response to norepinephrine in terms of both contractility and sensitivity, was increased in the pravastatin-treated SHR aorta but not in the WKY aorta. The increased response was not observed in the presence of mevalonate. Acetylcholine-induced vascular relaxation in the aortas from both strains was not affected by pravastatin pretreatment. These results suggest that the vascular response to norepinephrine may be affected by the intracellular cholesterol synthesis pathway.", 
    "40": "The heterotrimeric G protein G0 is highly enriched in the growth cones of neuronal cells and makes up 10% of the membrane protein of growth cones from neonatal rat brain. We have used PC12 cells, a cell line that differentiates to a neuron-like phenotype, as a model with which to study the mechanism of G protein localization. First, the role of the beta gamma-subunit was investigated. The attachment of the beta gamma-subunit to the membrane depends on the isoprenylation of the gamma-subunit. The drug lovastatin blocks isoprenylation by inhibiting a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway. After treatment of PC12 cells with 10 microM lovastatin for 48 hours 50% of the beta gamma-subunits were cytosolic compared with 100% membrane bound beta gamma in control cells, as determined by cell fractionation, gel electrophoresis and western blot. Addition of 200 microM mevalonic acid reverses this effect. However, lovastatin affects neither the membrane attachment of alpha 0 nor its localization to the growth cones as determined by immunohistochemistry. This suggests that the localization and retention of alpha 0 are independent of the membrane attachment of the full complement of beta gamma-subunits. Second, pertussis toxin was used to block the interaction between alpha 0 and receptors. PC12 cells were treated with 0.1 microgram/ml pertussis toxin prior to and during nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. In vitro [32P]ADP-ribosylation confirmed that alpha 0 and alpha i were completely ADP-ribosylated by this treatment. The ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin did not interfere with neurite outgrowth. The localization of alpha 0 to the growth cones was indistinguishable from that in untreated cells. We conclude that G protein-receptor interaction is not necessary for the distribution of alpha 0 to growth cones.", 
    "41": "Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between hyperlipidemia and rate of progression of renal disease, suggesting that lipids can induce or aggravate glomerular injury mainly by interacting with mesangial cells. Nevertheless, recently has been demonstrated that increased cholesterol levels can also induce endothelial cell dysfunction. Thus, since endothelium is known to play a major role in modulating the vascular tone, we have tested the possibility that hypercholesterolemia impairs the renal hemodynamics in patients with active nephrotic syndrome and elevated serum cholesterol levels. In this single-blind, nonrandom study, 12 patients were treated with pravastatin (group T, treated, n = 12) and 8 with placebo (group C, controls, n = 8). The controls were studied after the pravastatin group had been completed. Before starting the treatment the patients underwent basal determinations including routine laboratory investigations and PAH and inulin clearances. The same determinations were repeated after 48 h, and 6 and 12 weeks from the beginning of the treatment. The study at 48 h was performed to see if pravastatin had a direct, cholesterol-independent effect on renal function. The following basal results were reported (mean +/- SEM; group T vs. group C): serum cholesterol (mmol/l) 9.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 9.1 +/- 0.3 (NS); proteinuria (g/24 h): 6.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 7.0 +/- 0.7 (NS); PAH clearance (ml/min): 353 +/- 21 vs. 385 +/- 31 (NS); inulin clearance (ml/min): 62.5 +/- 7.7 vs. 67 +/- 9.3 (NS). After 48 h, no changes were observed in both groups. Subsequently, in group T, the following percentage changes of basal levels were observed: serum cholesterol -21.4 +/- 3.2% at 6 weeks (p < 0.05) and -34.9 +/- 3.2% at 12 weeks (p < 0.01); inulin clearance +3 +/- 3.7% at 6 weeks (NS) and +9.3 +/- 2.9% at 12 weeks (p < 0.05); PAH clearance +7 +/- 3.1% at 6 weeks (p < 0.05) and +21.2 +/- 5.5% at 12 weeks (p < 0.01). By contrast, no significant changes of these parameters occurred in group C at any time, so that the percent changes of baseline values of CPAH were significantly greater in group T (at 6 weeks: p < 0.05; at 12 weeks p < 0.005). These results indicate that the reduction of cholesterol is associated with a significant increase in renal plasma flow, thus, suggesting that hypercholesterolemia may actually impair the renal hemodynamics. We speculate that this effect may contribute to increase the risk of ischemic acute renal failure in nephrotic patients and, along with changes induced in the mesangium by other mechanisms, to contribute to the progression of renal disease.", 
    "42": "Some metabolites and products of mevalonic acid are involved in various cellular functions, particularly cell growth. In this study, we assessed the effects of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on cell viability and DNA production of rat hepatocytes stimulated with epidermal growth factor. Pravastatin (0.1 to 10 microM) induced a dose-dependent reduction of DNA synthesis, assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation in rat hepatocytes, which dropped by approximately 60% at a drug concentration of 10 microM. This suppression of DNA synthesis was nearly reversed by exogenous mevalonic acid, but was not prevented by purified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Pravastatin did not affect the mitochondrial reduction of Dimethylthiazolyl-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT), but induced apoptotic change as assessed by nuclear chromatin staining. This apoptotic change was also reversed by exogenous mevalonic acid. These results indicate that mevalonic acid metabolites are necessary for DNA synthesis by rat hepatocytes stimulated by epidermal growth factor and for suppressing cell death.", 
    "43": "Within the cholesterol biosynthesis cascade, the enzyme 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase [EC 5.4.99.7] is of special interest due to its dual function: cyclization of 2,3-monoepoxysqualene to lanosterol and 2,3;22,23-diepoxysqualene to oxylanosterol. Further determination of the significance of this enzyme for the intracellular cholesterol homeostasis was done with BIBX 79, a new potent, specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In HepG2 cells the effects of BIBX 79 on cholesterol biosynthesis, 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase as well as HMG-CoA reductase activities were studied. BIBX 79 is a potent inhibitor of sterol biosynthesis in HepG2 cells (IC50 4 x 10(-9) M). No other enzyme within the cholesterol biosynthesis cascade was significantly inhibited as was evidenced by a radio HPLC detection system. In contrast to simvastatin, no direct interaction with HMG-CoA reductase was observed. When incubating HepG2 cells for 16 h with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (10(-6)-10(-10) M) HMG-CoA reductase activity was increased up to 180%. BIBX 79 did also affect HMG-CoA reductase activity under these conditions: in concentrations of BIBX 79 \"> or =\" 10(-9) \"< or =\" 10(-7) M, where a partial inhibition of 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase is observed, HMG-CoA reductase activity was decreased. However, higher concentrations of BIBX 79 that totally blocked 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase led to an increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity. This effect of BIBX 79 on HMG-CoA reductase is thought to be mainly mediated by oxysterols that are formed by the cyclization of 2,3;22,23-diepoxysqualene. 2,3;22,23-Diepoxysqualene is preferentially cyclized by the 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase and, consequently, only high inhibitor concentrations will also block 2,3;22,23-diepoxysqualene cyclization. Thus, by partial blockade of this enzyme, both an inhibition of lanosterol and subsequently cholesterol formation as well as a concomitant effect on HMG-CoA reductase can be achieved. Both effects complement each other and lead to an effective control of cholesterol biosynthesis. It is therefore concluded that 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase plays a crucial role in the regulation of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. 2,3-Oxidosqualene cyclase inhibitors offer an attractive approach for novel lipid-lowering agents.", 
    "44": "There is evidence that the overproduction of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins by the liver is the underlying event in some forms of dyslipoproteinemia. This metabolic status is associated to an increased risk of developing premature coronary artery disease CAD. The conclusions from previous studies suggested that the availability to the hepatocytes of cholesterol that is readily esterified is an important determinant for VLDL and LDL secretion. In the present study, we set out to investigate the effect of the specific stimulation and inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol esterification, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT, E.C. 2.3.1.26), on the lipid and on the apoB-100 secretion rate from a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). When the specific ACAT inhibitor FCE 27677 (10-5 M) was added to the cultures, a decrease of the cellular cholesteryl ester content and at the same time a significant reduction of the neutral lipids and of the apoB-100 secretion rate were noticed. The stimulation of ACAT by 25-hydroxycholesterol (20 microgram/ml) caused a 4-fold increase of the cellular cholesteryl ester content and a 2-fold increase of the lipoprotein secretion rate. FCE 27677 (10-5 M to 10-7 M) prevented the effects elicited by the oxysterol. On the contrary, lovastatin (10-6 M) and gemfibrozil (10-6 M) had no effect. The analysis of the lipid and of the apolipoprotein composition of the lipoproteins secreted in the medium revealed that ACAT inhibition had the dual effect of both decreasing the number of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins secreted as well as their cholesteryl ester load. Altogether, these data support the idea of a close relationship between ACAT activation, leading to increased cholesteryl ester availability, and apoB-100-containing lipoprotein secretion. It is speculated that ACAT inhibitors may prove useful for the treatment of human dyslipoproteinemias caused by the hepatic overproduction of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins.", 
    "45": "The major relation existing between cell growth, migration and cholesterol homeostasis prompted us to investigate the effect of the new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor cerivastatin (BAY W 6228) on these cellular events. The molecule inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the migration and the replication (evaluated as cell number and nuclear incorporation of 3H-thymidine) of rat arterial SMC with IC50 values of 2.7 microM and 0.5 microM, respectively. Among the tested statins BAY W 6228 resulted to be the most potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis and cell proliferation. Conditions producing 80-90% inhibition of cholesterol synthesis correlate with approximately 50% inhibition of cell growth. Similar results were obtained in SMC from human femoral artery. The in vitro inhibition of cell migration and proliferation induced by BAY W 6228 (80% decrease) was completely prevented by the addition of mevalonate and partially prevented (60-80%) by farnesol and geranylgeraniol, confirming the specific role of isoprenoid metabolites-probably through a prenylated protein(s)-in regulating these cellular events. The present results provide evidence that BAY W 6228 interferes, at least in vivo, with smooth muscle cells migration and proliferation, major processes involved in atherogenesis.", 
    "46": "A randomly selected subset of 100 pairs of baseline and 36-month follow-up carotid B-mode ultrasound examinations from the 919 patients participating in the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study (ACAPS) were subjected to a blinded rereading at the conclusion of the trial to assess temporal bias in the measurement of carotid artery intimal-medial thickness (IMT). The original measurements of the primary outcome variable and five secondary outcome variables at baseline and 36 months, respectively, and the 3-year change in each of these variables, were compared with those obtained from the rereadings. For the primary outcome variable, the mean value of 12 IMT measurements obtained from predefined carotid segments, the mean difference (original-rereading) and the 95% confidence interval which resulted from the rereadings were -0.005 (-0.033, 0.023) mm at baseline and -0.009 (-0.031, 0.013) mm at 36 months. The difference in the 3-year change was -0.004 (-0.038, 0.028) mm. The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference between the rereadings and the original readings for the baseline and the 36-month follow-up examinations included zero for all of the six outcome variables as was also the case for the 3-year change in each variable. The magnitude of the mean differences for these 18 variables ranged from 0.004 to 0.034 mm. Intraclass correlation coefficients between the original readings and rereadings ranged from 0.56 to 0.87 with the 3-year changes in outcome variables tending to have lower correlations and the 36-month examinations higher correlations. The carotid IMT measurement process, when combined with uniform reader training, certification and monitoring of reading performance throughout the course of the study, can avoid the temporal bias observed in other studies.", 
    "47": "Experimental evidence suggests that lipids may modulate progressive renal injury. The inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase have demonstrated beneficial effects in different models of progressive renal failure. Recent experimental data suggests that these agents also may have glomerular protective effects independent of reduction in circulating lipids. Monocyte infiltration, mesangial cell proliferation and mesangial matrix expansion have been shown to be early events in the process of glomerulosclerosis that can be lessened by HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. In vitro, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit mesangial cell proliferation, as well as the production of chemokines involved in macrophage biology. These effects appear to be related to a reduction in cell production of cholesterol precursors, the so-called nonsterol isoprenoids. The isoprenoids are an important class of lipids necessary for isoprenylation of proteins such Ras, which are involved in cell signaling for various growth-promoting cytokines. We have also shown that interference with this signaling pathway results in marked reduction in the activation of nuclear transcription factors. Thus, it would appear that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have the potential of modifying mesangial cell biology independent of any lipid-lowering effect. Clinically, a number of studies have shown that increased lipids are associated with an accelerated rate of progression of renal disease. Indeed, these lipid abnormalities are evident in the diabetic patient at the onset of microalbuminuria. In diabetic and nondiabetic patients, preliminary studies have suggested that interventions with these agents may have salutary effects on the progression of renal disease. Recently, experimental and clinical studies have also suggested that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may also reduce the severity of chronic vascular rejection.", 
    "48": "The murine monoclonal antibody BU31 binds to the nuclear membrane of many cell types. The expression of the BU31 antigen has previously been shown to have an inverse correlation with the proliferative index in lung tumours, defined by Ki67 staining. The distribution of BU31-positive cells is now shown to parallel the distribution of non-dividing cells in a range of normal human and rat tissues, although neuroendocrine cells and germ cells in the testis show no reactivity. Cells grown in culture and induced to undergo growth arrest show a higher level of labelling with BU31 than their proliferating counterparts. Confocal laser scanning microscopy reveals that the BU31 antigen is distributed predominantly along the nuclear lamina, with occasional internal foci. This distribution is very similar to that of the nuclear membrane proteins lamin A and lamin C, suggesting that the BU31 antigen and lamins A and C could be one and the same. Immunoblotting using recombinant lamin proteins confirmed this proposal. Moreover, a monoclonal antibody to the non-proliferation-associated antigen, statin, also recognizes lamins A and C. These data indicate that the demonstration of lamins A and C can be used to provide information on the proliferative activity of normal and neoplastic tissues. These data also suggest a role for nuclear lamins A and C during cellular quiescence, possibly through the reorganization and maintenance of nuclear structure, or more directly through interactions with the retinoblastoma gene product or related proteins.", 
    "49": "In order to investigate the effects of lovastatin on adrenal and gonadal function, we prospectively determined the basal and gonadorelin-stimulated concentrations of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and the cortisol response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in a sample of 25 male patients with advanced chronic renal failure, hypercholesterolemia and proteinuria. Hormone studies were done prior to and after lovastatin treatment. The values of these patients were compared with those of a matched healthy control group. Before starting treatment with lovastatin, the patients showed significantly lower testosterone concentration and higher LH concentration than the control group. After stimulation with gonadorelin, they also showed a lower increase in testosterone and LH. After 12 months of lovastatin treatment, a significant decrease in the concentration of cholesterol, LDL C, VLDL C and apo B was observed, but neither the basal testosterone concentration nor the response to gonadorelin stimulation was modified. Before treatment, basal and ACTH-stimulated serum cortisol levels did not differ from those of the control group. After lovastatin treatment, neither the basal serum cortisol levels nor the response to ACTH was modified. We conclude that in the patients studied, although the decrease in testosterone concentration may be partially attributable to a decrease in its synthesis, lovastatin treatment does not increase testosterone deficit. This is either because this drug does not inhibit gonadal hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase at the does given or because the cholesterol which LDL C provides the cell with is enough to maintain testosterone synthesis.", 
    "50": "Atraumatic rhabdomyolysis with consecutive oliguric renal failure occurred in a 67-year-old man with chronic renal insufficiency in the pre-dialysis phase after four years of therapy with lovastatin without complications. Diuresis remained low after normalization of the muscle enzymes, and the patient required chronic hemodialysis. This case report shows that lovastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis with consecutive myoglobinuric renal failure can be seen also after long-standing lovastatin therapy. In pre-existing renal insufficiency this can lead to earlier requirement of chronic dialysis treatment.", 
    "51": "The ribonuclease protection assay procedure described enables the relative quantitation of either single mRNAs or multiple mRNA species simultaneously in a sample of total RNA and demonstrates its applicability to two systems of relevance to the study of apolipoproteins, namely, liver tissue and liver-derived cell lines in culture. The main requirements of the method are the availability of cDNA cloned into a vector that directs the transcription of antisense RNA for the preparation of radioactive probes, and choice of suitable restriction endonuclease sites for linearizing the cDNA so that the final protected products of the various mRNA species are sufficiently different in size to allow their separation. For moderately abundant apolipoprotein mRNAs in rat liver, the method is sensitive down to 1 microgram total RNA. Other experimental sources of RNA or the assay of less abundant mRNA species may require a larger amount of starting material. These aspects of the assay need to be determined for each probe/ tissue system to be studied. The need for adjustments to the specific radioactivity of the probes will depend on the relative abundance of the target mRNA molecules and can be readily determined empirically. The rationale for varying the specific radioactivities to facilitate multiple assays as suggested here is both simple and effective. A preliminary assay provides information on the relative levels of the mRNA species of interest, and the step of preparing, in parallel, a sample of unlabeled antisense RNA provides the means for quantitative dilution of specific radioactivity of the 32P-labeled RNA probe where required.", 
    "52": "The affinity of (+)-, (-)- and (+/-)- fluvastatin, a new synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor developed as a racemate, for specific human P450 monooxygenases in liver microsomes was compared with that of the pharmacologically active acidic forms of lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin.", 
    "53": "Affinity was determined as the inhibitory potency for prototype reactions for 3 major drug metabolising enzymes: diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation (CYP2C9), dextromethorphan O-demethylation (CYP2D6), and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (CYP3A4).", 
    "54": "Lovastatin acid, pravastatin and simvastatin acid displayed moderate affinity for all three P450 isozymes (estimated Ki > 50 micromol.1(-1)). Racemic and (+)- and (-)-fluvastatin showed moderate affinity (estimated Ki > 50 micromol.1(-1)) for CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, whereas their affinity for CYP2C9 was high (estimated Ki < 1 micromol.1(-1)). Diclofenac 4'-hydroxylation was competitively and stereoselectively inhibited, with measured Ki's of 0.06 and 0.28 micromol.1(-1) for (+)- and (-)- fluvastatin, respectively.", 
    "55": "Fluvastatin selectively inhibits a major drug metabolising enzyme (CYP2C9), the (+)-isomer (pharmacologically more active) showing 4-5 fold higher affinity. As already reported for lovastatin and simvastatin, in vivo drug interactions by inhibition of liver oxidation of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. hypoglyceamic sulphonylureas and oral anticoagulants) may be expected.", 
    "56": "We examined the phenotypic characteristics, molecular genetics and optimal pharmacological treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) in an English family with combined hyperlipidaemia. The proband presented in adulthood with classical clinical characteristics of CTX, a greater than tenfold elevation in plasma cholestanol and combined hyperlipidaemia. His brother also had typical features of CTX without the presence of dyslipidaemia. Genotyping revealed that the two brothers were compound heterozygotes for a novel missense mutation in exon 2 (R94Q) and for a recently described nonsense mutation in exon 5, of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (CYP27). Analysis of all available family members revealed that hyperlipidaemia did not co-segregate with the presence of a CYP27 mutant allele. Trial of therapy showed that the lowest plasma sterol and triglyceride concentrations and cholestanol:cholesterol ratio were achieved with the combination of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) 750 mg/day, a primary bile acid, and simvastatin 40 mg/day, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. CDCA alone and simvastatin alone significantly lowered plasma cholestanol concentration, but the decrease was greater with the former. After 1 year there was significant improvement in both cognitive and motor function with regression of tendon xanthomata on computerized tomography. We conclude that CTX in this English pedigree is probably due to compound mutant alleles in CYP27, that combined hyperlipidaemia in this family is unrelated to CTX, and that this complicated condition responds optimally to the combination of CDCA and simvastatin.", 
    "57": "Luminal renarrowing (restenosis) is the major limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and the search for a 'magic bullet' to prevent this apparent biological healing response to vessel injury has thus far been unsuccessful. Large clinical trials using serial quantitative coronary angiography have, however, provided some valuable insight into this area. In particular, the restenosis process may be measured as the loss in minimal luminal diameter from post-PTCA to follow-up angiography, and is essentially ubiquitous and normally distributed. The angiographic outcome of clinical trials can thus be appropriately evaluated using a continuous rather than a categorical approach, which also considerably reduces the number of patients required. Fluvastatin, a synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, has been shown experimentally to reduce the neointimal proliferative response after PTCA, independent of its lipid-lowering action. The FLuvastatin Angioplasty REstenosis trial was designed to evaluate whether fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily, commencing at least 2 weeks before planned PTCA, can reduce luminal loss by 30% from successful PTCA to follow-up angiography at 26 +/- 2 weeks in 730 evaluable patients.", 
    "58": "Fluvastatin, a new synthetic inhibitor of HMGCoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, has been studied in several models to examine its effects when used in combination with other lipid-modifying agents such as derivatives of fibric acid (bezafibrate), resins (cholestyramine), and niacin. The combination of fluvastatin with bezafibrate has been studied in a double-blind trial involving patients with well-documented familial hypercholesterolaemia. Fluvastatin 40 mg/day, combined with either bezafibrate 400 mg/day or cholestyramine 8 g/day, resulted in reductions in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), these being indistinguishable between the groups; however, significantly greater increases in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (21.3%) and reductions in levels of triglycerides (25.1%) were seen with the fluvastatin-bezafibrate combination. No notable increases were seen in levels of serum creatine kinase, aspartate aminotransferase, or alanine aminotransferase, and no cases of myopathy were observed. In a study model that examined low-dose combinations of fluvastatin with cholestyramine, reductions in levels of LDL-C of 15.8% and 19.3% were seen with fluvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg, respectively. After an 8-week interval in which a daily dosage of cholestyramine 8 g was added, from baseline, reductions of 26.3% in the 10 mg fluvastatin-cholestyramine group and 31.2% in the 20 mg fluvastatin-cholestyramine group were observed, whereas the placebo-cholestyramine group displayed a reduction of 14.9%. Doubling the resin dosage to 16 g/day for the final 8 weeks of the study provided little additional benefit. Myotoxicity has been observed when lovastatin is coadministered with niacin, and so the combination of niacin with fluvastatin has also been studied to examine the possibility of this effect occurring. Patients were randomised to either fluvastatin 20 mg or placebo for 6 weeks, after which time open-label niacin was administered to all patients and titrated to a final dosage of 3 g/day. After 6 weeks, fluvastatin produced a 20.8% reduction in LDL-C levels from baseline. When combined with niacin, a 43.7% reduction was noted at the week 15 endpoint, against the 26.5% reduction seen with niacin monotherapy. The combination was well tolerated, with no reports of myopathy or of significant elevations in creatine kinase or liver transaminase levels. Combinations of fluvastatin with a variety of other agents have been shown to have significant effects on lipid profiles, with no evidence to date of clinically remarkable safety findings. Thus, the use of combination therapies may result in optimal management of patients with moderately severe hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemic profiles.", 
    "59": "Both the European Atherosclerosis Society and the US National Cholesterol Education Program have issued revised guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), based on a multitude of recent epidemiological and angiographic studies. Both authorities agree that a target plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level is the single most important parameter, this target level being different for primary and secondary prevention. The introduction of statins for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia provides an important tool to enable target LDL-C levels to be reached in most cases of primary prevention. For secondary prevention, however, the target LDL-C levels--2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl)--may be achieved in only a fraction of cases. Others may require the concomitant administration of other cholesterol-lowering drugs, such as bile-acid sequestrants (resins) and/or derivatives of fibric acid (fibrates). The use of statin-fibrate combinations has been discouraged since the report by the US Food and Drug Administration of 12 sporadic cases of myositis or rhabdomyolysis. During the past 7 years, however, 21 clinical trials have examined the efficacy and safety of statin-fibrate combinations in a total of 486 patients with a variety of dyslipidaemias. Overall, the combinations were proven to be effective and safe, and the incidence of abnormalities in liver function tests and levels of creatine kinase (CK) was low. A double-blind study has been carried out at the Hadassah University Hospital to examine the efficacy and safety of fluvastatin when combined with either cholestyramine (group 1) or bezafibrate (group 2) for the treatment of 38 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Patients in group 2 showed a reduction in plasma LDL-C levels of 35% and in LDL-C to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio of 45% compared with 32% and 38% respectively in group 1. Both cholestyramine and bezafibrate produced an additional benefit of a 13% reduction in LDL-C levels in comparison with fluvastatin as monotherapy. An open-label ongoing study on a larger cohort of FH patients reveals that a decrease in plasma LDL-C levels of up to 38.5% may be achieved with a combination of fluvastatin 80 mg/day and bezafibrate 400 mg/day. In both studies, biochemical safety analyses revealed no notable abnormalities in liver function tests or levels of CK. It was concluded that fluvastatin-bezafibrate is a very effective synergistic therapy for heterozygous FH and is superior to a fluvastatin-cholestyramine combination.", 
    "60": "Statins are regarded as a well-tolerated class of drugs, particularly when compared with some of the older lipid-modifying agents, which have poor rates of compliance. Despite some early concern, the incidence of lens opacities observed in clinical studies involving statin use is no different from that in a normal ageing population. Similarly, the occurrence of insomnia with lipophilic agents appears to have been overemphasised and is not a clinically significant problem, irrespective of the statin under study. Fluvastatin is the newest representative of this class of agents; it has already been evaluated in thousands of patients who have hyperlipidaemia with and without additional risk factors. In controlled clinical studies, the incidence of the majority of adverse events observed with fluvastatin therapy is no higher than that seen with placebo, with the exception of gastrointestinal disturbances (known to be common to all stains). Nonetheless, the incidence of these effects seen with fluvastatin treatment is noted to be lower than that associated with cholestyramine or fibrate use. Elevations in levels of liver transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) have been reported with fluvastatin therapy but have led to discontinuation of treatment with the same frequency as with placebo. Elevations in creatine kinase levels as a cause of discontinuing fluvastatin are not more frequent than with placebo. Drug-related myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have not been reported with fluvastatin therapy, and myalgia does not occur more frequently than with placebo. In terms of drug interactions, fluvastatin does not interfere with the efficacy of antihypertensive agents. In controlled clinical trials, the overall reported discontinuation rate due to adverse events noted with fluvastatin therapy is not significantly distinguishable from the rate associated with placebo.", 
    "61": "In many patients with primary hyperlipidaemia the statins have become the drugs of choice when diet alone has failed. The usual dosages of statins prescribed in most countries appear to be aimed at producing a reduction in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of about 25%. Fluvastatin is the newest member of this class of agent and the first completely synthetic compound. In dose-finding studies, fluvastatin has produced statistically significant (P < 0.001) reductions in LDL-C levels when used in dosages of 20 mg (21%) and 40 mg (27.4%), thus placing it within the range generally expected with usual dosages of other statins; additional studies have shown that the efficacy of fluvastatin is unaffected by gender and age. Moreover, fluvastatin produces the maximum reduction in LDL-C levels within 6 weeks and maintains this efficacy during long-term treatment (LDL-C levels have been reported to fall by 27.4% over 2 years with fluvastatin 40 mg/day). In high-risk patients the LDL-C-lowering effect of fluvastatin 40 mg/day is maintained when compared with low-risk patients (26.6% vs 24.8%). A similar pattern has been observed in hypertensive patients, irrespective of the antihypertensive agent used to control blood pressure. Fluvastatin has been found to produce better LDL-C-lowering effects than bezafibrate. In addition to lowering LDL-C levels by the required amount, 20 and 40 mg (the equivalent of pravastatin 20 mg) dosages of fluvastatin significantly reduce levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.", 
    "62": "Fluvastatin is the first synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitor to be approved for clinical use, and has been studied extensively in humans since 1986. It is structurally distinct from the other currently available HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin), leading to unique biopharmaceutical properties relative to the other agents of this class. Absorption of fluvastatin is virtually complete across all species, including man, and is not affected by the presence of food. Systemic exposure is limited, as fluvastatin is subject to first-pass metabolism, and the plasma half-life of the drug is approximately 30 minutes. Some 95% of a single dosage of fluvastatin is excreted via the biliary route, with less than 2% of this being the parent compound. Additionally, there is no evidence of circulating active metabolites or accumulation during chronic dosing. Studies of the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin have demonstrated marked reductions in the rate of bioavailability--from 40% to 60%; however, a comparison of fluvastatin administration with the evening meal or at bedtime has revealed no significant differences in the extent of bioavailability (area under the curve) of these two regimens. Furthermore, no significant difference in pharmacodynamic effect (reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) could be ascertained between mealtime dosing and bedtime dosing. The pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin have also been assessed in various demographic groups. Relative to the general population, plasma concentrations of fluvastatin do not vary as a function of either age or gender. In addition, administration to a patient population with hepatic insufficiency resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in both the rate and extent of bioavailability relative to controls. Also, although minimal alterations of fluvastatin clearance in patients with renal insufficiency are anticipated due to limited renal excretion (5%), a study in this patient group is currently underway to examine this further. Interaction studies have been performed with fluvastatin and several drugs with which it might be coadministered. Cholestyramine, an anionic-binding resin, has a considerable effect in lowering the rate and extent of fluvastatin bioavailability. Although this effect was noted even when cholestyramine was given 4 hours prior to fluvastatin, this regimen did not result in diminished efficacy. Further, no effects on either warfarin levels or prothrombin times were observed in a study involving concomitant administration of warfarin and fluvastatin. Moreover, additional interaction studies with niacin and propranolol have not demonstrated any effect on fluvastatin plasma levels, and administration to a patient population chronically receiving digoxin resulted in no difference in the extent of bioavailability of digoxin relative to control data. The results generated to date in clinical pharmacokinetic studies with fluvastatin thus support its use in a broad population of hypercholesterolaemic patients.",

    "68": "RPR 101821 (trans-2-[4-(benzoxazol-2-yl)-phenylmethoxy] amino cyclohexane hydrochloride) is a potent cholesterol-lowering agent in rodents and marmoset. The compound inhibited rat liver microsomal squalene synthase (IC50 = 1 nM) and 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) reductase (IC50 = 1 microM; Lewis et al. 1995). When RPR 101821 (10 mg/kg), the 7DHC reductase inhibitor BM 15.766 (4[2-[4-(4-chlorocinnamyl)piperazine-1-yl]ethyl] benzoic acid; 10 mg/kg) or the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin (30 mg/kg) was given orally to rats at -29 h, -21 h and -5 h, serum cholesterol was reduced by 56%, 46% or 15%, respectively. The reduction in cholesterol with RPR 101821 was associated with an accumulation of 7DHC in serum, suggesting an inhibition of 7DHC reductase. In the presence of BM 15.766, RPR 101821 reduced the serum accumulation of 7DHC in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition at 30 mg/kg, p.o. In Balb-cJ mice, RPR 101821 and lovastatin (50 mg/kg, b.i.d., p.o., for 14 days) lowered serum cholesterol by 67% and 2%, respectively. In marmosets, RPR 101821 and lovastatin (both at a dose of 10 mg/kg, p.o., b.i.d., for 7 days) reduced cholesterol by 28% and 19%, respectively. In summary, RPR 101821 is an orally effective potent cholesterol-lowering agent in rodents and a small primate species. The suggested mechanism of hypocholesterolemic effect is the inhibition of squalene synthase and 7DHC reductase.", 
    "69": "Although several cholesterol-lowering interventions have reduced coronary heart disease (CHD) events in clinical trials, drug therapy for hypercholesterolaemia has not been as widely used as the US and European guidelines recommend, mainly because until recently there was insufficient clinical trial evidence for improved survival. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) is the first trial of lipid-lowering therapy to demonstrate an unequivocal reduction in total mortality. Largely as a result of this study, there is now little disagreement on the necessity to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol effectively in hypercholesterolaemic patients with CHD. Many physicians believe it is also important to reduce elevated levels of LDL cholesterol in patients without overt coronary disease, but more clinical trial evidence will be required before this is universally accepted. Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase are the most effective class of agents for this purpose, and have become widely used. It is likely that the magnitude of risk reduction produced by lipid-lowering therapy is proportional to the degree of cholesterol lowering achieved, which is an important consideration when selecting an agent and deciding the dosage to use. The results of several multicentre comparative trials have clearly established that the 4 members of the class are not all equipotent on a mg basis in terms of their effects on lowering LDL cholesterol. They have shown that the hypolipidaemic effect of simvastatin 5 mg approximately equals that of pravastatin 15 mg and lovastatin 15 mg and that of fluvastatin 40 mg, all given once daily. The tolerability profiles of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are excellent. Five-year data are available for simvastatin and lovastatin, and to date there is no good evidence for important differences in safety or tolerability among the class.", 
    "70": "Increasing experimental evidence suggests that lipids might be important modulators in progressive glomerulosclerosis. The inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase have demonstrated beneficial effects in different models of progressive renal failure. Monocyte infiltration, mesangial cell proliferation and mesangial matrix expansion have been shown to be early events in the process of glomerulosclerosis that can be lessened by HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. Recent experimental data suggest that these agents may also have glomerular protective effects independent of a reduction in circulating lipids. In vitro, lovastatin has been shown to downregulate mesangial cell production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and colony-stimulating factor. In addition, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can directly reduce mesangial cell proliferation. These effects appear related to the ability of this class of agents to inhibit mesangial cell formation of intermediates of cholesterol formation, the nonsterol isoprenoids. Although low density lipoprotein cholesterol can induce mesangial cells to increase synthesis of matrix proteins, e.g., type-IV collagen, we have shown that lovastatin does not directly influence mesangial cell type-IV collagen metabolism. Thus, prevention of mesangial matrix expansion in vivo with type-IV collagen by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors could be related to an indirect mechanism related to inhibition of monocyte influx into the glomerulus. Alternatively, a direct effect of these agents, through their cholesterol-lowering capabilities, could play a role in reducing matrix expansion.", 
    "71": "Since we have previously shown that farnesol (F-OH) and geranylgeraniol (GG-OH) can be utilized for protein isoprenylation, the ability of the free allylic isoprenols to overcome the lovastatin-induced block on rat C6 glial cell proliferation has been investigated. Lovastatin an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in mevalonate biosynthesis, inhibited the rate of cell growth in a concentration dependent manner. The addition of mevalonate and GG-OH to lovastatin treated cells was shown to overcome the drug induced inhibition of cell proliferation. This result indicates that geranylgeraniol is capable of providing the mevalonic acid-derived products necessary to support cell growth. These results suggest that isoprenols are converted to an \"activated' form, possibly the corresponding allylic pyrophosphate intermediate by reactions that remain to be characterized, prior to being utilized for sterol biosynthesis and protein isoprenylation.",

We report here the characterization of an HMG-CoA reductase from the third domain, the archaea. HMG-CoA reductase of the halobacterium Haloferax volcanii was initially partially purified from extracts of H. volcanii. Subsequently, a portion of the H. volcanii lovastatin (formerly called mevinolin) resistance marker mev was subcloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pT7-7. While no HMG-CoA reductase activity was detectable following expression in E. coli, activity could be recovered after extracts were exposed to 3 M KCl. Following purification to electrophoretic homogeneity, the specific activity of the expressed enzyme, 24 microU/mg, equaled that of homogeneous hamster or P. mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase. Activity was optimal at pH 7.3. Kms were 66 microM (NADPH) and 60 microM [(S)-HMG-CoA]. (R)-HMG-CoA and lovastatin inhibited competitively with (S)-HMG-CoA. H. volcanii HMG-CoA reductase also catalyzed the reduction of mevaldehyde [optimal activity at pH 6.0; Vmax 11 microU/mg; Kms 32 microM (NADPH), 550 microM [(R,S)-mevaldehyde]] and the oxidative acylation of mevaldehyde [optimal activity at pH 8.0; Vmax 2.1 microU/mg; Kms 350 microM (NADP+), 300 microM (CoA), 470 microM [(R,S)-mevaldehyde]].

    "79": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FHC) in swine, which resembles human familial combined hyperlipidemia, is a complex lipid and lipoprotein disorder associated with the development of severe coronary lesions similar to those occurring in advanced human coronary disease. The disorder is characterized by elevated plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoproteins (apo) B, C-III, and E, and by decreased levels of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), apoA-I, and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity. A dose-response study with simvastatin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, was conducted in four treatment groups of FHC animals, exhibiting TC > or = 250 mg/dL. The animals were fed 0, 80, 200, or 400 mg simvastatin daily for 3 weeks. The measured serum parameters included the levels of TC, VLDL-C, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, lathosterol, apoA-I, B, C-III, and E, as well as LCAT activity. Simvastatin at 200 mg/d significantly decreased the levels of TC (-25%), LDL-C (-27%), lathosterol (-40%), apoB (-22%), apoC-III (-37%), and apoE (-24%) and modestly decreased the levels of HDL-C (-12%) and apoA-I (-11%) (percent relative to the average pretreatment and posttreatment baseline values) but did not affect the levels of TG, VLDL-C, the lathosterol/TC ratio, or LCAT activity. The levels of TC, LDL-C, apoB, and E were also lowered by simvastatin at 80 or 400 mg/d, but to a lesser extent than at 200 mg/d, while the other parameters were not influenced at these doses. The simvastatin-induced decreases of LDL-C, HDL-C, and apoA-I, B, C-III, and E were significantly correlated among each other. These results show that the trend of responses in TC, LDL-C, apoB, apoC-III, and apoE to simvastatin in the FHC swine is similar to that observed in humans, although the drugs is less potent and efficacious in swine, while the results are different from those in humans with regard to the remaining parameters.",

To determine the extent to which these levels affect vascular function, we assessed flow-mediated (endothelium-dependent) brachial artery vasoactivity noninvasively before, during, and after cholesterol lowering (simvastatin 10 mg/day) in 7 healthy middle-aged men with cholesterol levels meeting current recommendations. Flow-mediated brachial artery vasoactivity was measured using 7.5 MHz ultrasound and expressed as percent diameter change from baseline to hyperemic conditions (1 minute following 5 minutes of blood pressure cuff arterial occlusion). Flow-mediated vasoactivity rose from 5.0 +/- 3.6% at baseline to 10.5 +/- 5.6%, 13.3 +/- 4.3%, and 15.7 +/- 4.9% (all p < 0.05) as cholesterol fell from 200 +/- 12 to 161 +/- 18, 169 +/- 16, and 153 +/- 11 mg/dl after 2, 4, and 12 weeks, respectively, of cholesterol-lowering therapy. Vasoactivity and cholesterol returned to baseline levels 12 weeks after simvastatin discontinuation. Overall, vasoactivity was found to correlate inversely with cholesterol levels (r = -0.47, p = 0.004). These data suggest that flow-mediated brachial artery vasoactivity responds rapidly to changes in cholesterol levels and that endothelial function improves by lowering cholesterol levels below recommendations of current guidelines.",

    "83": "The Felodipine Atherosclerosis Prevention Study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the calcium antagonist felodipine ER and combined felodipine/simvastatin therapy on retarding the progression of atherosclerosis, estimated by serial changes in coronary calcium evaluated by noninvasive electron beam computed tomography. Subjects include 180 men and women aged 40 to 69 and 50 to 69 years, respectively, with moderate type IIa dyslipidemia, with either cardiovascular disease or risk factors. All subjects receive simvastatin lipid-lowering therapy, and are randomized either to felodipine or placebo for a treatment period of 2 years. Monitoring of blood chemistry, measures of lipids and apolipoproteins, blood pressure, evaluation of symptoms, and interim clinical event monitoring are done at routine follow-up visits. Baseline and 2-year follow-up electron beam computed tomography, measuring changes in total calcium score, area, and mass, evaluate the effects of intervention on the progression of calcified atherosclerosis. The results from the Felodipine Atherosclerosis Prevention Study will provide valuable information about the effect of felodipine alone and in combination with simvastatin on progression of calcified atherosclerosis evaluated noninvasively.", 
    "84": "The effect of compactin (a lovastatin analogue) on vascular smooth muscle cells was studied at the level of cell proliferation and protein kinase C. It was observed: a) an inhibition of cell proliferation by compactin at a micromolar range, which was prevented by simultaneous addition of mevalonate; b) a stimulation of DNA synthesis with a shift in the cell cycle kinetics, either in the presence or absence of fetal calf serum and c) an increase in protein kinase C activity in compactin-treated cells in the G1 phase of the cycle. This increase was similar to the one elicited by calyculin A, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases of type PP-1 and PP-2A. It is suggested that compactin behaves as a PP-1/PP-2A protein phosphatase inhibitor, inhibiting proliferation of smooth muscle cells by a block of the cell cycle after the S-phase.", 
    "85": "When used for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, treatment with an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase results in worthwhile benefit that clearly exceeds any risk in patients whose risk of coronary death is 1.5% or more per year. This evidence can be extrapolated logically to primary prevention of coronary disease provided that treatment is targeted at those with similar or higher risk. We present a table that refines previously proposed methods of risk prediction. The table identifies subjects who have the specified degree of coronary risk; shows the serum cholesterol concentration that confers that degree or risk in the individual; and identifies subjects who will not have this degree of risk, irrespective of their cholesterol concentration. It is simple enough for use in ordinary practice. The table highlights the predominant effect of age on coronary risk; a person who is free of vascular disease and younger than 52 years is unlikely to have the specified degree of risk. Even in older people (60-70 years) several risk factors are generally required to attain this degree of risk. Some people are candidates for lipid- lowering drug treatment with serum cholesterol as low as 5.5 mmol/L, whereas others with cholesterol as high as 9.0 mmol/L are not. Although cholesterol lowering is a powerful method for preventing coronary events in people at high risk, cholesterol measurement by itself is not a good way to identify those with high coronary risk. The method can be adapted readily to target a different level of coronary risk as new evidence on the benefit and risk of treatment becomes available.", 
    "86": "A total of 47 patients suffering from heterozygous hyperlipidemia were treated with LDL-apheresis (24 patients, aged 49.5 +/- 11.5 years), diet and/or lipid-lowering drugs or with diet and lipid-lowering drugs only (23 patients, aged 48.0 +/- 11.9 years). After treatment periods of 44.4 +/- 14.3 (apheresis group) and 33.5 +/- 15.9 (drug group) months, respectively, the ensuing results revealed significant differences (p < 0.0001): total cholesterol decreased from 10.4 to 5.5 vs 9.9 to 8.7 mmol/l, LDL from 7.4 to 3.9 vs 6.6 to 5.2 mmol/l, triglycerides from 5.8 to 3.7 vs 4.8 to 4.1 mmol/l and the LDL/HDL-ratio decreased from 7.1 to 3.4 vs 6.7 to 5.8. In the apheresis group one patient died from myocardial infarction vs one non-fatal myocardial infarction and the manifestation of coronary heart disease in three cases in the drug group. There were no severe side-effects in either group. All patients in the apheresis group experienced an increased clinical performance. On the other hand physological well-being of these patients was lower than that of the drug group (scores 42.3 +/- 8.9 vs 50.2 +/- 9.9, p < 0.002). The present trial suggests that a continuing reduction in serum lipid concentrations may lower in a dose dependent manner the risk of development and progression of coronary heart disease. With respect to clinical and laboratory results, LDL-apheresis seems safe and appears to be the most effective therapy.", 
    "87": "The efficacy of simvastatin in reducing plasma cholesterol is well documented. Other molecules within the apo lipoprotein family, particularly lipoprotein (a) Lp(a), have recently been found to have a predictive and/or causative role in atherosclerosis. Based on these considerations, we studied 15 patients affected by primary hypercholesterolemia to evaluate the effect of simvastatin in Lp(a) and apoprotein plasma levels (A1, B, C2, C3, E), in addition to the classic lipid parameters. Clinical and laboratory parameters were evaluated before therapy, after 12 weeks of therapy, and after 5 weeks of drug withdrawal. Simvastatin therapy produced a significant reduction in total cholesterol (CH) and LDL-CH (p < 0.0001), and a significant increase in HDL-CH (p < 0.01); no variation was observed in triglyceride (TG) levels. Simvastatin therapy further showed a significant decrease in apoC2 (p < 0.05), the apo C2/C3 ratio (p < 0.01), and apoE (p < 0.01), as well as a significant increase in Lp(a) plasma levels (p < 0.05). All of the parameters studied returned to pretreatment values 5 weeks after drug withdrawal; only HDL-CH persisted above the values reached during therapy. Our data agree with those documenting the beneficial effect of simvastatin in greatly decreasing CH and LDL-CH, but point out the need for further studies on the long-term effect of simvastatin on apoprotein molecules, such as on Lp(a), in order to fully establish its role in the secondary prevention of atherosclerosis.", 
    "88": "The present study analyses the effects of simvastatin, a specific inhibitor of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA reductase) in male Syrian hamsters fed a standard diet or a diet supplemented with 0.12% cholesterol and 20% coconut oil. In hamsters fed the standard diet, gastric administration of simvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) during 12 days was found to be lethal and to have hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects. This toxicity was exacerbated in hamsters fed a hyperlipidaemic diet and was preceded by a progressive anorexia and loss of body weight. Marked elevations in serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase activities were associated with the organ lesions. All elevated biochemical changes and morphological alterations were prevented or reversed by coadministration of mevalonate, the product of the HMG-CoA reductase. It is suggested that the dramatic effect of simvastatin could result from depletion of a non-sterol metabolite of mevalonate in spite of a lack of protective effects of farnesol and geranylgeraniol in the following study. The toxicity of simvastatin could indeed result from the low basal activity of HMG-CoA reductase in hamster liver coupled with a prolonged inhibition of mevalonate synthesis.", 
    "89": "A systematic examination of the evidence on the relationship between serum cholesterol and ischaemic heart disease shows conclusively that serum cholesterol reduction in populations with high rates of heart disease is an effective and safe method of reducing ischaemic heart disease rates. The relative protective effect is greater at younger ages (50% reduction at age 40 for a 0.6 mmol/l reduction in serum cholesterol declining to about 20% at age 70 or more). The absolute protective effect is greater if the disease is common because the effect of a give serum cholesterol reduction is proportional to the prevailing heart disease rate. The full effect of a serum cholesterol reduction is evident after about 5 years. The use of drugs of the 'statin' type can lower serum cholesterol by about 1.8 mmol/l, yielding a reduction in risk of about 60% at age 60. A diet typical in Japan would lower serum cholesterol by about 1.2 mmol/l and lead to a halving of the risk. Only modest serum cholesterol reductions (about 0.3 mmol/l) are generally achievable by individuals altering their diet independently of others and this is expected to lead to a 15% reduction in the risk of ischaemic heart disease at age 60. Larger reductions (about 0.6 mmol/l) require collective action over the supply and preparation of food which could reduce the risk by about 30%. Achieving the full impact of serum cholesterol reduction in a population will require a national nutritional policy. It is not something that can be effectively left to individual action.", 
    "90": "The effects of simvastatin and pravastatin on cholesterol biosynthesis were compared in 26 hypercholesterolemic patients who were randomly allocated to either simvastatin or pravastatin treatment (20 mg once daily) for 6 weeks in a crossover trial. Serum total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lathosterol (latho) concentrations and lathosterol/cholesterol (latho/chol) ratios (the latter two are considered as reliable indices of whole body cholesterol synthesis) were evaluated at the beginning and end of each therapeutic sequence. Reductions in TC and LDL-C were more pronounced (P < 0.001) with simvastatin (TC = -28.0%, LDL-C = -35.6%) than with pravastatin (TC = -19.6%, LDL-C = -25.2%). These results were associated with concomitant decreases in both latho concentrations (-59.0% with simvastatin and -37.0% with pravastatin) and latho/chol ratios (-43.0% with simvastatin and -20.3% with pravastatin). Simvastatin resulted in more marked diminutions of latho concentrations (P < 0.01) and latho/chol ratios (P < 0.05) than pravastatin. These results suggest that the better efficacy of simvastatin on serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol might result in part from a greater inhibitory action of simvastatin on cholesterol synthesis compared with that of pravastatin.", 
    "91": "Oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is known to be toxic to a variety of cell types, but relatively little is known about the toxic effects of oxLDL on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). We found that LDL oxidized by incubation with 5 microM cupric ions was toxic to cultured porcine SMC when administered at concentrations of 25 micrograms protein/ml and higher. The toxicity was demonstrated whether cells were proliferating or not, and was more evident in the presence of 0.4% lipoprotein-deficient serum than in 10%. Because of recent evidence that 7-ketocholesterol and 7-hydroxycholesterol are toxic species in copper-oxidized LDL, inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase was hypothesized as a mechanism of toxicity. However, mevalonic acid, the product of this enzyme, failed to protect against the toxicity of either oxLDL or the pure oxysterols. Alpha-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol acetate, probucol, butylated hydroxytoluene, and deferoxamine provided partial protection to SMC exposed to oxLDL. These results suggested a toxic role for newly initiated lipid peroxidation, either in cells or in media oxLDL. Cellular lipid peroxidation appeared more likely, since no further oxidation of media oxLDL was demonstrated in the presence or absence of antioxidants. Overall, the results suggest that toxicity of copper-oxidized LDL for SMC is multifactorial and differs from the previously described toxicity of iron-oxidized LDL for fibroblasts.", 
    "92": "Injured neurons in the CNS are known to synthesize high levels of proliferation related oncogene products and heat shock proteins without dividing. Statin is a cell cycle regulated nuclear phosphoprotein, selectively associated with the non-proliferative state in a wide variety of cell types. In the present study, neuronal statin was examined following lethal or sublethal neuronal injuries in the hippocampus of Alzheimer's disease patients, in rats receiving kainate lesions to the dorsal hippocampus and in entorhinal cortex lesioned rats. Immunolabelling of nuclear statin showed that statin immunoreactivity increased preferentially in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease. In kainate lesioned rats, statin immunoreactivity was markedly induced in the CA3 hippocampal region in association with neuronal loss. Entorhinal cortex lesioned rats showed a transient induction of statin between 2 and 6 days post lesion in CA1 neurons. However, cell counts in entorhinal cortex lesioned rats remained unaltered in the CA1 and granule cell layers during the entire 30 day time course, indicating that increased statin levels are not secondary to neuronal degeneration and are not necessarily accompanied by irreversible neuronal death. It is concluded that, in addition to proliferation related gene products, neuronal injury induces an increase in levels of statin, a nuclear marker of cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, statin may be a potentially useful marker of injurious neuronal stress, even under conditions that do not necessarily lead to irreversible cell death.", 
    "93": "The results of several lipid-lowering randomized trials were released during the past year. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study has contributed significantly to the understanding of lipid-lowering on all-cause and coronary mortality outcome. An approximate 25% net difference in cholesterol between the simvastatin and placebo group produced a 30% reduction in total mortality in the simvastatin group (P < 0.01). No increase in noncardiovascular mortality or nonfatal diseases was observed. Although angiographic trials that study atherosclerosis are not designed to show the effect on clinical outcome, several new trials such as the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Progression Study, the Multicentre Anti-Atheroma Study, the Canadian Coronary Atherosclerosis Intervention Trial and the Stanford Coronary Risk Intervention Project all add information that is consistent with the results from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study. The meta-analysis of randomized cholesterol-lowering trials also indicates that no excess of all-cause mortality is present when the degree of cholesterol reduction and treatment modality is adjusted. It is probable that the excess mortality from noncardiovascular causes found in unadjusted analyses is due to specific effects of hormones and fibrate drug treatments to reduce cholesterol. It is concluded that the lipid hypothesis is confirmed more solidly than ever before.", 
    "94": "The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study showed that a 35% decrease in LDL-cholesterol was accompanied by a 42% reduction in coronary mortality. Even if the period of time is longer than 1 year for the divergence of survival curves in the simvastatin and placebo groups there are reasons to believe that the beneficial effect of lipid lowering is rapid. The effect may be mediated by stabilization of lipid-rich coronary lesions or by effects on endothelium. Lipid-lowering studies in the acute stage of coronary heart disease are suggested.", 
    "95": "A wide consensus has been reached concerning the importance of lipid-lowering drug therapy in patients with dyslipidaemia with overt coronary heart disease. This consensus is also likely to be reflected in the more active treatment of other high-risk patient groups. The statin family of drugs has been tested in a large secondary prevention study, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, and in angiographic trials. Their role in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and mixed hyperlipidaemia is increasing, whereas fibrates are increasingly limited to hypertriglyceridaemia.",
