    "0": "Simvastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is a commonly used cholesterol-lowering agent. The long-term safety profile of simvastatin, established over 10 years of clinical use, is excellent. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors block 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. However, other important nonsterol compounds, such as coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), are also derived from the same synthetic pathway. CoQ10 is an essential carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain that participates in oxidative phosphorylation. Simvastatin and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been documented to lower serum concentrations of CoQ10. It has been suggested that the adverse effect of myopathy caused by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is due to CoQ10 deficiency in the tissue mitochondria. Documentation of this cause-and-effect phenomenon, however, has been lacking. We offer evidence that lactic acidosis may develop as a complication of simvastatin therapy. Our patient also manifested the well-known HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor drug toxicities of rhabdomyolysis and hepatitis. The occurrence of these known adverse events with lactic acidosis in our patient suggests that interference of the mitochondrial respiratory chain may play a role in the toxicity of this class of drugs.", 
    "1": "Complement-mediated vascular injury is important in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Because recent evidence shows that statins have beneficial effects on endothelial cell (EC) function independent of lipid lowering, we explored the hypothesis that statins modulate vascular EC resistance to complement through the upregulation of complement-inhibitory proteins. Human umbilical vein and aortic ECs were treated with atorvastatin or simvastatin, and decay-accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein, and CD59 expression was measured by flow cytometry. A dose-dependent increase in DAF expression of up to 4-fold was seen 24 to 48 hours after treatment. Statin-induced upregulation of DAF required increased steady-state mRNA and de novo protein synthesis. L-Mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate reversed the effect, confirming the role of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibition and suggesting that constitutive DAF expression is negatively regulated by geranylgeranylation. Neither farnesyl pyrophosphate nor squalene inhibited statin-induced DAF expression, suggesting that the effect is independent of cholesterol lowering. Statin-induced DAF upregulation was mediated by the activation of protein kinase Calpha and inhibition of RhoA and was independent of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and NO activity. The increased DAF expression was functionally effective, resulting in significant reduction of C3 deposition and complement-mediated lysis of antibody-coated ECs. These observations provide evidence for a novel cytoprotective action of statins on vascular endothelium that is independent of the effect on lipids and results in enhanced protection against complement-mediated injury. Modulation of complement regulatory protein expression may contribute to the early beneficial effects of statins in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis.", 
    "2": "This study investigated the metabolic interaction between fibrates and statin hydroxy acids in human hepatocytes. Gemfibrozil (GFZ) modestly affected the formation of beta-oxidative products and CYP3A4-mediated oxidative metabolites of simvastatin hydroxy acid (SVA) but markedly inhibited the glucuronidation-mediated lactonization of SVA and the glucuronidation of a beta-oxidation product (IC(50) approximately 50 and 15 microM, respectively). In contrast, fenofibrate had a minimal effect on all the metabolic pathways of SVA. GFZ also significantly inhibited (IC(50) approximately 50-60 microM) the oxidation of cerivastatin (CVA) and rosuvastatin (RVA), but not of atorvastatin (AVA), while effectively decreasing (IC(50) approximately 30 to 60 microM) the lactonization of all three statins. As was observed previously with other statin hydroxy acids, RVA underwent significant glucuronidation to form an acyl glucuronide conjugate and lactonization to form RVA lactone in human liver microsomes and by UGT 1A1 and 1A3. While GFZ is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, it is a competitive inhibitor (K(i) = 87 microM) of CYP2C8, a major catalyzing enzyme for CVA oxidation. These results suggest that 1) the pharmacokinetic interaction observed between GFZ and statins was not likely mediated by the inhibitory effect of GFZ on the beta-oxidation, but rather by its effect primarily on the glucuronidation and non-CYP3A-mediated oxidation of statin hydroxy acids, and 2) there is a potential difference between fibrates in their ability to affect the pharmacokinetics of statins, and among statins in their susceptibility to metabolic interactions with GFZ in humans.", 
    "3": "Rosuvastatin is a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. The liver is the target organ for the lipid-regulating effect of rosuvastatin; therefore liver-selective uptake of this drug is a desirable property. The aim of this study was to investigate, and compare with pravastatin and simvastatin, the tissue-specific distribution of rosuvastatin. Bolus intravenous doses (5 mg/kg) of radiolabeled rosuvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin were administered to rats, and initial uptake clearance (CL(uptake)) in various tissues was calculated. Hepatic CL(uptake) of rosuvastatin (0.885 ml/min/g tissue) was significantly (p < 0.001) larger than that of pravastatin (0.703 ml/min/g tissue), and rosuvastatin was taken up by the hepatic cells more selectively and efficiently than pravastatin. Hepatic CL(uptake) of simvastatin (1.24 ml/min/g tissue) was significantly larger than that of rosuvastatin (p < 0.01) and pravastatin (p < 0.001). However, adrenal CL(uptake) of simvastatin (1.55 ml/min/g tissue) was larger than hepatic CL(uptake), and simvastatin was distributed to other tissues more easily than rosuvastatin. Microautoradiography of the liver, spleen, and adrenal was undertaken 5 min after administration of the study drugs; distribution was quantified by counting the number of silver grains. After administration of rosuvastatin and pravastatin, silver grains were distributed selectively in the intracellular space of the liver, but more rosuvastatin (3.3 +/- 1.0 x 10(5) particles/mm(2)) than pravastatin (2.0 +/- 0.3 x 10(5) particles/mm(2)) tended to distribute to the liver. Simvastatin was less liver-specific (it also distributed to the spleen and adrenal). The results of this study indicated that rosuvastatin was taken up by hepatic cells more selectively and more efficiently than pravastatin and simvastatin.", 
    "4": "To investigate whether the increased interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) secretion in hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome is due to the accumulation of mevalonate kinase (MK), the substrate of the deficient enzyme, or the lack of its products, the isoprenoid compounds.",

Culture supernatants were collected for cytokine analysis 48 hours after stimulation with monoclonal antibodies against CD2 + CD28.", 
    "6": "Lovastatin induced a 15-fold rise in IL-1beta secretion by normal anti-CD2 + CD28-stimulated cells (P < 0.001). This effect could be countered by mevalonate and, to a lesser extent, by FOH and GGOH. In the absence of lovastatin, mevalonate did not change IL-1beta secretion. Stimulated MK-deficient cells secreted 9-fold more IL-1beta than control PBMCs (P < 0.005), rising 2.4-fold in the presence of lovastatin. The effect of lovastatin on IL-1beta secretion was reduced by mevalonate, FOH, and GGOH. Isoprenoid biosynthesis in PBMCs from patients was impaired due to the endogenous MK deficiency. Bypassing this defect with FOH, in the absence of lovastatin, led to a 62% reduction (P < 0.02) in IL-1beta secretion by these cells.",

    "8": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of oral cerivastatin (0.1 mg/kg/day) on vascularized allogenic transplanted bone that is treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) (10 mg/kg/day) and on vascularized isogenic transplanted bone that is not treated with CsA. Allogenic transplantation was performed on 12-week-old male DA rats with the major histocompatibility antigen (MHC) RT1a (as the donor) and age-matched male Lewis rats with MHC RT1l (as the recipient), and isogenic transplantation was performed on 12-week-old male Lewis rats. After transplantations, 20 rats (10 rats in each transplantation) were randomized into four groups to receive the following treatment for 16 weeks: (1) CsA plus cerivastatin vehicle or (2) CsA plus cerivastatin in the allogenic transplanted rats, and (3) CsA vehicle plus cerivastatin vehicle or (4) CsA vehicle plus cerivastatin in the isogenic transplanted rats. Bone biochemical markers, mineral density, and strength were measured at the end of the study period. Serum levels of osteocalcin (OC) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) level were higher in the allogenic transplanted rats than in the isogenic transplanted rats. In the allogenic transplanted rats, the cerivastatin treatment decreased urinary DPD levels, but not serum OC nor PTH levels. Furthermore, the cerivastatin treatment improved bone mineral density of the allogenic transplanted bones and bone strength of the allogenic reconstructed bones. In contrast, no effect of the cerivastatin treatment was observed in the isogenic transplanted rats. These results suggest that the cerivastatin treatment improves CsA-induced high-turnover osteopenia mainly through the inhibition of bone resorption.", 
    "9": "Statins improve vascular functions by mechanisms independent from their cholesterol-lowering effect. Rho GTPases are emerging as key targets for the vascular effects of statins. RhoB is a short-lived, early-response inducible protein involved in receptor endocytosis, apoptosis, and gene expression. Here we show that statins regulate RhoB expression by acting at multiple levels. Simvastatin increased RhoB protein levels by 8- to 10-fold. This effect was related to a depletion of isoprenoid intermediates, as deduced from the observation that several metabolites of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, namely, mevalonate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, attenuated simvastatin-induced RhoB up-regulation. Moreover, prenyltransferase inhibitors mimicked simvastatin effect. Cholesterol supplementation did not prevent simvastatin-elicited up-regulation but increased RhoB levels per se. Simvastatin moderately augmented RhoB transcript levels, but markedly impaired the degradation of RhoB protein, which accumulated in the cytosol in its non-isoprenylated form. Inhibition of RhoB isoprenylation was apparently required for simvastatin-induced up-regulation, because levels of an isoprenylation-deficient RhoB mutant were not affected by simvastatin. Moreover, this mutant was found to be markedly more stable than the wild-type protein. These results show that RhoB isoprenylation is necessary for rapid turnover of this protein and identify a novel link between the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the regulation of G-protein expression.",

However, as clinical outcomes become available it appears that statins are proving more beneficial than expected and thus it is being proposed that the actions of statins go beyond their ability to lower serum cholesterol levels. The report that statins can interact directly with lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 and prevent it engaging with the intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 receptor on T cells is a novel mechanism of statin action and provides convincing evidence that these compounds can regulate biological systems other than by the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Immunosuppression to prevent organ transplant rejection is one application for which statins are currently being assessed. The clinical evidence is conflicting and does not convincingly reflect whether statins are beneficial as immunomodulators. However, in vivo studies investigating the cellular actions of statins have identified two mechanisms by which statins can potentially modulate an in vivo immune response. Firstly, statins regulate inducible class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on macrophages and endothelial cells. Secondly, statins can inhibit LFA-1 adhesion to ICAM-1 and thus regulate T cell activation. These findings suggest that statins have the potential to regulate an immune response in vivo and that more investigation is essential in order to explain the opposing clinical data.",

Atorvastatin induced progressive CIMT regression over 12 months (change in CIMT, -0.034+/-0.021 mm), whereas CIMT was stable in the pravastatin group (change of 0.025+/- 0.017 mm; P=0.03).",

Interventional studies conducted with statins showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk and total mortality, which was enhanced when the absolute risk was high in the population studied. Moreover, there was a linear relationship between the decrease in cholesterol and the reduction of coronary events. FOR OPTIMAL CARDIOVASCULAR PREVENTION: Many arguments are in favor of a drastic reduction in LDL-cholesterol (< 1 g/l) for secondary prevention and in patients at high vascular risk (absolute cardiovascular risk greater than 20% over 10 years), without the possibility, today, of clearly defining the optimal target level in these patients. However, in daily practice the therapeutic aims established by national and international recommendations are rarely reached, as is shown by several epidemiological surveys. NEW THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES: To obtain even lower levels of LDL-cholesterol, two strategies are possible, either combined with other hypolipidemic substances, such as intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitors, or administration of more potent statins (rosuvastatin, pitavastatin). Nonetheless, the other risk factors must also be treated in order to reduce the patients' global cardiovascular risk score.",

Treatment with rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg body wt per day), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, enhanced the circulating pool of endothelial progenitor cells, propagated the advent of bone marrow-derived endothelial cells in the injured vessel wall, and, thereby, accelerated reendothelialization and significantly decreased neointimal formation.",

    "37": "During the past decade, the perception flourished that lipid and antioxidant therapy were 2 independent avenues for cardiovascular protection. However, studies have shown that commonly used antioxidant vitamin regimens do not prevent cardiovascular events. We found that the addition of antioxidant vitamins to simvastatin-niacin therapy substantially blunts the expected rise in the protective high density lipoprotein (HDL)2 cholesterol and lipoprotein(A-I) subfractions of HDL, with apparent adverse effects on the progression of coronary artery disease. To better understand this effect, 12 apolipoproteins, receptors, or enzymes that contribute to reverse cholesterol transport have been examined in terms of their relationship to HDL2 and lipoprotein(A-I) levels and the potential for antioxidant modulation of their gene expression. Three plausible candidate mechanisms are identified: (1) antioxidant stimulation of cholesteryl ester transfer protein expression/activity, (2) antioxidant suppression of macrophage ATP binding cassette transmembrane transporter A1 expression, and/or (3) antioxidant suppression of hepatic or intestinal apolipoprotein A-I synthesis or increase in apolipoprotein A-I catabolism. In summary, antioxidant vitamins E and C and beta-carotene, alone or in combination, do not protect against cardiovascular disease. Their use for this purpose may create a diversion away from proven therapies. Because these vitamins blunt the protective HDL2 cholesterol response to HDL cholesterol-targeted therapy, they are potentially harmful in this setting. We conclude that they should rarely, if ever, be recommended for cardiovascular protection.",

In unstable coronary artery disease, however, the pathophysiological background is distinct, and the potential benefits of statin therapy have not been evaluated until recently. Data from animal models and clinical studies indicate that statin treatment can influence a spectrum of molecular and cellular mechanisms that are intimately related to the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes; these include the reduction of circulating levels of atherogenic lipoproteins (very low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein remnants, intermediate density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein) and thus of arterial lipid deposition and the attenuation of inflammation, modulation of thrombogenesis and thrombolysis, improvement of endothelial dysfunction, and reduction of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Indeed, findings from prospective and observational studies have demonstrated that statin treatment significantly improves clinical outcome after acute coronary syndromes. Therefore, early initiation of statin therapy after an acute coronary event not only enhances adherence to treatment but also preempts the occurrence of new events. In this review, we discuss recent important developments in our knowledge of the clinical evidence of the beneficial effects of early statin therapy in acute coronary syndromes and the biological mechanisms that underlie them.",

Treatment of human aortic smooth muscle cells (hASMC) with Ang II for 24 hours resulted in a 3.2 +/- 0.5-fold increase in intracellular superoxide anion formation as detected by lucigenin assay. hASMC treated with clinical concentrations of fluvastatin (0-100 nM) showed a dose-dependent decrease in Ang II-activated superoxide anion formation. The addition of similar concentrations of trolox to hASMC inhibited Ang II-activated superoxide anion formation in a dose-dependent manner. However, simvastatin at similar doses failed to inhibit Ang II-activated superoxide anion formation by hASMC. Our results indicate that in addition to its hypocholesterolemic effect, fluvastatin may have direct antioxidative effects, suggesting its possible protective effect on atherosclerotic process.", 
    "45": "Cell degeneration in Alzheimer's disease is mediated by a toxic mechanism that involves interaction of the AbetaP peptide with the plasma membrane of the target cell. We report here that PC12 cells become resistant to the cytotoxic action of AbetaP when incubated in a medium that enriches cholesterol levels of the surface membrane. On the other hand, making cholesterol-deficient membranes by either cholesterol extraction with cyclodextrin or by inhibiting de novo synthesis of cholesterol makes PC12 cells more vulnerable to the action of AbetaP. Increasing cholesterol content of PS liposomes also suppresses AbetaP-dependent liposome aggregation. We suggest that by modifying the fluidity of the neuronal membranes, cholesterol modulates the incorporation and pore formation of AbetaP into cell membranes. This idea is supported by our finding that the enhanced cytotoxicity generated by lowering the membrane cholesterol content can be reversed by AbetaP calcium channel blockers Zn2+ and tromethamine.", 
    "46": "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder with impaired very long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) metabolism. The disease-associated ABCD1 (ALD) gene encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein, which belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters. Several treatment regimes have been tried without satisfactory clinical benefit. Recently, the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin was reported to normalize VLCFA levels in two out of three clinical studies. This investigation aimed to disclose the molecular mechanism of successful reduction of VLCFA accumulation in order to fill in the gap in the understanding how dietary cholesterol lowering affects the levels of VLCFA in patients with X-ALD and to allow more efficacious treatment. Overexpression of ABCD2 (ALDR), the closest relative of ABCD1, restores VLCFA accumulation in cultured ABCD1-deficient cells. Here we show by real-time PCR that the ABCD2 gene is induced in cultured human fibroblasts and monocytes upon sterol depletion via a mechanism requiring the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), a family of transcription factors that control the metabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids. This is unexpected and the first report that extends the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by SREBPs to a peroxisomal protein, thus providing a closer link between peroxisomes, cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. Using reporter gene studies, site-directed mutagenesis and gel shift assays, we identified a functional sterol regulatory element in the proximal promoter region of ABCD2. Finally, we demonstrated that ABCD2 induction by sterol depletion significantly reduced the accumulation of VLCFA in X-ALD fibroblasts. Thus, lowering cholesterol leads to SREBP maturation, increased ABCD2 expression and reduced VLCFA accumulation.", 
    "47": "Relatively brief periods (days) of hypercholesterolemia can exert profound effects on endothelium-dependent functions of the microcirculation, including dilation of arterioles, fluid filtration across capillaries, and regulation of leukocyte recruitment in postcapillary venules. Hypercholesterolemia appears to convert the normal anti-inflammatory phenotype of the microcirculation to a proinflammatory phenotype. This phenotypic change appears to result from a decline in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability that results from a reduction in NO biosynthesis, inactivation of NO by superoxide (O(2)(*)(-)), or both. A consequence of the hypercholesterolemia-induced microvascular responses is an enhanced vulnerability of the microcirculation to the deleterious effects of ischemia and other inflammatory conditions. Hence, therapeutic strategies that are directed towards preventing the early microcirculatory dysfunction and inflammation caused by hypercholesterolemia may prove effective in reducing the high mortality associated with ischemic tissue diseases. Agents that act to maintain the normal balance between NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vascular endothelial cells may prove particularly useful in this regard.", 
    "48": "The use of statin agents in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) remains an area of intense clinical interest. Statin therapy has an established secondary preventive benefit in patients with coronary artery disease, and its extension to ACS seems logical. A number of observational studies have shown an association between initiation of statin therapy early in ACS and improved clinical outcome. Additionally, 4 randomized controlled trials have examined the use of statin therapy for ACS: the Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering (MIRACL) study, the Pravastatin Turkish Trial, the Fluvastatin on Risk Diminishing After Acute Myocardial Infarction (FLORIDA) study, and the Lipid-Coronary Artery Disease (L-CAD) study. Three of these trials showed a benefit with early initiation of statin therapy, whereas 1 trial demonstrated neither benefit nor harm. All the available trials lacked the power and design to sufficiently evaluate whether early initiation of statin therapy reduces mortality and reinfarction in patients with ACS. Four ongoing trials have been designed and sufficiently powered to determine whether statin therapy reduces the risk of death and reinfarction when initiated early in ACS treatment. A body of evidence suggests that the pleiotropic actions of statin agents might modulate benefit in ACS. This article summarizes the available data and provides a rationale for early initiation of statin therapy for patients with ACS.", 
    "49": "Increasing evidence supports an important role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Recently, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, 'statins', have demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects independent of cholesterol-lowering.", 
    "50": "We tested the hypothesis that a statin would improve outcome in a murine model of renal IRI. Upon finding a protective effect, we tested the hypothesis that the mechanisms by which statins protected in renal IRI was by reducing neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-6.", 
    "51": "Cerivastatin at various dosing regimens was administered to NIH Swiss mice to evaluate the effects on renal IRI. Analysis of renal structure, function, neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, cytokine production, as well as mortality was performed in cerivastatin- and saline-treated groups.", 
    "52": "PRIMARY: Cerivastatin pretreatment for 3 days led to a significant improvement in renal function, tubular injury as well as survival after IRI compared to saline-treated mice. SECONDARY: Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into kidney tissue was similar in both groups. IL-6 was markedly upregulated early in the kidneys of statin-treated compared to saline-treated mice.", 
    "53": "These data demonstrate that a statin compound can improve the course of ischemic acute renal failure. Induction of protective molecules such as IL-6 may underlie this effect.", 
    "54": "The main pathological changes observed in scleroderma kidney are edema and proliferation of intimal cells, glomerular changes with thickening and obliteration of arteries leading to decreased renal perfusion and increased renin release. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the cornerstone in the treatment of patients with scleroderma renal crisis. Statins are used in the prevention of primary and secondary cardiovascular events. These drugs control cell proliferation and may prevent the injury observed in scleroderma kidney.", 
    "55": "The continuous physical and chemical irritation of the peritoneum in peritoneal dialysis patients can result in a nonbacterial serositis with increased fibrin deposition, thus promoting peritoneal fibrosis and adhesion development. By expressing the fibrinolytic enzyme tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and its specific inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HMC) play an important role in regulating peritoneal fibrinolysis.", 
    "56": "Cultured HMC were used to examine the effect of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, on the expression of t-PA and PAI-1. Antigen concentrations in the cell supernatants were measured by ELISA and Northern blot analysis was conducted for mRNA expression.", 
    "57": "Simvastatin time- and concentration-dependently increased t-PA and decreased PAI-1 synthesis, reaching maximal effects after 48 hours, when simvastatin (1 micromol/L) increased t-PA levels 5.1 +/- 0.1-fold and suppressed PAI-1 levels 2.6 +/- 0.2-fold. This was accompanied by a twofold increase in mesothelial cell-associated t-PA activity. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in cultured human endothelial cells, but the effects were less pronounced and required higher simvastatin concentrations. Northern blot analysis revealed that the action of simvastatin on t-PA and PAI-1 expression in HMC can be explained by parallel changes in t-PA and PAI-1 mRNA. The effects of simvastatin were prevented in the presence of mevalonate and geranylgeraniol, suggesting that the effect of simvastatin on t-PA and PAI-1 synthesis is mediated through geranylgeranyl-modified intermediates. Experiments using specific inhibitors of geranylgeranylated Rho GTPases excluded a role of members of this family of small GTP-binding proteins in simvastatin action in HMC. The effects of simvastatin on t-PA and PAI-1 expression as well as on cell shape were completely mimicked by cytochalasin D, a disrupter of cellular actin filaments, but not by colchicine, a disrupter of microtubules.", 
    "58": "In conclusion, the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin is an effective stimulator of local peritoneal fibrinolytic activity, as it increases t-PA and decreases PAI-1 production in mesothelial cells by a mechanism involving geranylgeranyl-modified intermediates and actin skeleton perturbation. These results provide a new rationale to prevent peritoneal fibrin deposition and adhesion development in peritoneal dialysis patients.", 
    "59": "Peritoneally dialyzed subjects (CAPD) are prone to dyslipidemia and have a high risk of cardiovascular death. Statins (hydroxy-methylglutaryloCoA reductase inhibitors) show beneficial effects on serum lipids and hemostasis in kidney diseases. The purpose of this study was to assess platelet functions, some hemostatic parameters-extrinsic coagulation pathway-total, truncated, free TFPI (tissue factor pathway inhibitor), TF (tissue factor), TFPI/Xa and TF/VIIa complexes, as well as a marker of endothelial cell injury--von Willebrand factor--vWF and serum lipids in 10 hyperlipidemic CAPD patients treated with simvastatin (Zocor, MSD, at a dose of 10 mg at bedtime) for 3 months. Cholesterol and LDL fell significantly as early as after 1 month and remained lowered during further months of the therapy. No significant changes in von Willebrand factor, free TFPI, TF, TFPI/Xa and TF/VIIa complexes were found during therapy with simvastatin. Truncated TFPI decreased significantly as early as after 1 month and total TFPI decreased after 3 months of the therapy with simvastatin. Simvastatin is an effective hypolipemic agent. It seems that simvastatin have no or only little effect on endothelial function and extrinsic coagulation pathway in peritoneally dialyzed patients.", 
    "60": "Patients with combined dyslipidemia are at greatly increased coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. The threat of rhabdomyolysis with dual pharmacologic treatment (hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors plus fibric acid derivatives) has tended to limit therapy in patients with combined dyslipidemia to a choice of one or the other drug. Judgment of the potential benefits of either agent has rarely taken into account their effect on the postprandial accumulation of highly atherogenic, triglyceride (TG)-rich, remnant lipoprotein particles (RLPs). Because this information could be of substantial clinical relevance, we addressed this question in patients with type 2 diabetes and combined dyslipidemia by comparing the effects of gemfibrozil versus HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) on both fasting and postprandial lipid and lipoprotein concentrations. For this purpose, 22 patients with type 2 diabetes and combined dyslipidemia were randomized to treatment with either a statin or gemfibrozil for 3 months. Glycemic control was similar in both groups at baseline and did not change in response to treatment. Baseline lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were also similar in the 2 treatment groups, but the responses to therapy were quite different. Statin-treated patients had a statistically significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration (156 mg/dL to 96 mg/dL, P <.001), whereas there was no change in patients treated with gemfibrozil. In contrast, there was a statistically significant decrease (P <.05) in plasma TG concentrations (116 mg/dL) in gemfibrozil-treated individuals, without any change in subjects treated with statins. However, the decrease in total integrated postprandial plasma RLP response measured hourly from 8 AM to 4 PM was not different in patients treated with either gemfibrozil (-43%) or statins (-34%). These results indicate that statin treatment, in addition to its beneficial effect on hypercholesterolemia, was as effective as gemfibrozil in reducing postprandial accumulation of triglyceride-rich, atherogenic RLPs in patients with type 2 diabetes and combined dyslipidemia. As such, the clinical utility of statin monotherapy in the treatment of combined dyslipidemia may have been underestimated.", 
    "61": "Recent data suggest that statins may be potent immunomodulatory agents. In order to evaluate the potential role of statins as immunomodulators in MS, the authors studied their immunologic effects in vitro and compared them to interferon (IFN)beta-1b.", 
    "62": "Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from untreated or IFN beta-1-treated patients with relapsing-remitting MS or from healthy donors (HD) and T cells were stimulated with concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, or antibody to CD3 in the presence of lovastatin, simvastatin, mevastatin, IFN beta-1b, or statins plus IFN beta-1b. The authors analyzed proliferative activity of T cells and B cells, cytokine production and release, activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), and surface expression of activation markers, adhesion molecules, and chemokine receptors on both T and B cells.", 
    "63": "All three statins inhibited proliferation of stimulated PBMC in a dose-dependent manner, with simvastatin being the most potent, followed by lovastatin and mevastatin. IFN beta-1b showed a similar effect; statins and IFN beta-1b together added their inhibitory potentials. Furthermore, statins reduced the expression of activation-induced adhesion molecules on T cells, modified the T helper 1/T helper 2 cytokine balance, reduced MMP-9, and downregulated chemokine receptors on both B and T cells. Besides strong anti-inflammatory properties, statins also exhibited some proinflammatory effects.", 
    "64": "Statins are effective immunomodulators in vitro that merit evaluation as treatment for MS.", 
    "65": "Statins significantly reduce cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality in patients with and without coronary artery disease. The potential of this drug class has yet to be fully explored. Accumulating evidence from basic research and clinical trials indicates that statins have pleiotropic effects that may largely account for the clinical benefits observed. Potential beneficial effects of these agents include enhancement of nitric oxide production in vasculature and the kidney. Statins have been shown to stabilize unstable plaques, improve vascular relaxation, and promote new vessel formation. Clinical trials and animal studies have shown that these agents reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks and events, progression of nephropathy, development of diabetes, and fracture rates; these are benefits that go beyond lipid lowering alone. Potential beneficial effects are due to the positive impact on vascular and glomerular nitric oxide (NO) production and attenuation of vascular inflammation. Effects on bone, including fracture reduction, are thought to be mediated by direct action on bone formation. Moreover, potential reduction in the development of diabetes as observed in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) may relate to the improvement in insulin sensitivity. These actions are mediated, in part, by the effects on small G-proteins, modulation of signaling cascades, transcription, and gene expression. In particular, the inhibition of small GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Ras, and Rac, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation, may play an important role in mediating the direct cellular effects of statins on the vascular wall. The clinical relevance of these effects is beginning to be recognized, and ongoing studies will be able to answer these many questions in the near future. Actions of statins on vascular, glomerular, bone, and insulin-sensitive tissue as well as effects of statins on cognitive function and oncoprotection will be discussed in this review.", 
    "66": "The method of lovastatine and mevinolinic acid known as competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA-reductase and produced by micromycetes was elaborated. The inhibitors from diluted water solutions were fully absorbed on Diapak C16 patrons. The rate of inhibitors elution from the patrones was more than 95 per cent. Patrons may be used for concentration of lovastatine group inhibitors from the culture media. Inhibitors synthesis by the Penicillium citrinum 89 was investigated in dynamics with the use of Diapak C16 patrones. It was shown that UV-spectrum of inhibitor produced by P. citrinum 89 was identical with compactin spectrum and had absorbance maximum at 230, 237 and 247 nm.", 
    "67": "We previously have found that advanced glycation end products (AGE), senescent macroproteins formed at an accelerated rate in diabetes, arise in vivo not only from glucose but also from reducing sugars. Furthermore, we recently have shown that glyceraldehyde- and glycolaldehyde-derived AGE (glycer- and glycol-AGE) are mainly involved in loss of pericytes, the earliest histopathological hallmark of diabetic retinopathy. However, the effects of these AGE proteins on angiogenesis, another vascular derangement in diabetic retinopathy, remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether these AGE proteins elicit changes in cultured endothelial cells that are associated with angiogenesis. When human skin microvascular endothelial cells (EC) were cultured with glycer-AGE or glycol-AGE, growth and tube formation of EC, the key steps of angiogenesis, were significantly stimulated. The AGE-induced growth stimulation was significantly enhanced in AGE receptor (RAGE)-overexpressed EC. Furthermore, AGE increased transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) and then up-regulated mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in EC. Cerivastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor; pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate; or curcumin was found to completely prevent the AGE-induced increase in NF-kB and AP-1 activity, VEGF mRNA up-regulation, and the resultant increase in DNA synthesis in microvascular EC. These results suggest that the AGE-RAGE interaction elicited angiogenesis through the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene via NF-kB and AP-1 factors. By blocking AGE-RAGE signaling pathways, cerivastatin might be a promising remedy for treating patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.", 
    "68": "The beneficial effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in cardiovascular disease have generally been attributed to their cholesterol-lowering property. However, an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that statins have direct anti-inflammatory effects that are not mediated by their hypocholesterolemic activity. In this article, the HMG-CoA-reductase-dependent and -independent mechanisms by which statins might affect leukocyte adhesion and migration to sites of inflammation are reviewed and the implications for the design of new statin-derived drugs are discussed.", 
    "69": "Renal disease is often associated with an increased risk of vascular events. Moreover, an accelerated form of atherosclerosis commonly occurs in these patients. The reasons for these associations are not clearly defined but include the widespread presence of several established risk factors (eg, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes). Other predictors of atherosclerotic disease may also be abnormally elevated (eg, homocysteine, fibrinogen, and lipoprotein a). In addition, there is evidence that impaired renal function per se predicts vascular risk. Despite this high-risk background, the potential benefit of treatment with statins has not been widely investigated in these patients. The present review considers the evidence (experimental and clinical) that statins exert beneficial effects in patients with different types of renal disease. This includes improved renal function, decreased microalbuminuria, and a fall in blood pressure. Statins may also improve renal allograft survival. The potential mechanisms mediating these effects are considered. The interactions between statins and several risk factors that may be present in patients with impaired renal function are also considered. There is an urgent need to define the role of statins in these high-risk patients. Which is the statin of choice? This question is relevant because impaired renal function can interfere with statin pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, other drugs administered to these patients may cause serious interactions with statins.", 
    "70": "Pravastatin when administered with cyclosporine (CsA) has been shown to ameliorate transplant vasculopathy in the clinical setting. Previously we showed that pravastatin prevents chronic rejection in rat cardiac and liver transplant models. Here we determine whether pravastatin prevents chronic rejection in a rat renal allograft model.", 
    "71": "Orthotopic renal transplantations were performed using Fisher 344 rats as donors and Lewis rats as recipients. Recipients were treated with low-dose CsA for 10 days to prevent acute rejection. Recipients were divided into three groups: CsA, CsA + pravastatin, and syngeneic. Renal function was assessed by serum creatinine level at day 130. Allografts were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry. Serum levels of alloantibodies were measured by flow cytometry. Intragraft cytokine mRNA expression was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Intragraft levels of the antiapoptotic Bag-1 gene were measured by Western blot.", 
    "72": "Unlike allografts from the pravastatin group, control allografts demonstrated glomerulosclerosis, vascular obliteration, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. Serum creatinine levels and graft infiltration of T cells and macrophages in the pravastatin-treated animals were significantly lower. Intragraft cytokines showed a T helper 2 polarization and decreased transforming growth factor-beta in the pravastatin group. Intragraft expression of Bag-1 was increased in the pravastatin group.", 
    "73": "This study demonstrates the ability of pravastatin to inhibit chronic rejection in rat renal allografts. Pravastatin's pleiotropic effects of reducing intragraft inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting immune cell infiltration, and causing up-regulation of the antiapoptotic gene Bag-1 suggest that its ability to prevent transplant chronic rejection may be multifactorial.", 
    "74": "We investigated the effects of atorvastatin on the lipid and the apoA-I-containing HDL subpopulation profiles in 86 patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD). The entire drug treatment period lasted 12 weeks (4-week periods of 20 then 40, then 80 mg/day). Each dose of atorvastatin treatment resulted in significant reductions in plasma total-C, LDL-C, and triglyceride (TG), and non-significant increases in HDL-C levels compared with placebo treatment. ApoA-I levels did not change significantly during any of the treatment periods. Despite the modest increase of HDL-C (6%, 7%, 5%) and no change in apoA-I levels, the distribution of the apoA-I-containing HDL subpopulations changed significantly during each treatment period. There were significant increases in the concentrations of the large LpA-I alpha-1 (24%, 39%, 26%) and pre alpha-1 (51%, 61%, 63%) subpopulations at the expense of the small lipoprotein LpA-I:A-II alpha-3 subpopulations which decreased on all doses, and the decreases were significant on the 40 and 80 mg/day doses (6%, 5%). Atorvastatin influences the lipid-related risk for CHD in two ways: first, it significantly decreases LDL-C and TG levels while increasing HDL-C, and second, it significantly shifts the HDL subpopulation profile of CHD patients toward that observed in subjects without CHD.", 
    "75": "Male Yucatan swine were allocated to four groups (n = 5-6 pigs per group): low fat (3%) fed control, high fat/2% cholesterol (CH) fed (HF), high fat/CH fed with alloxan-induced diabetes (DF) and DF pigs that were treated with atorvastatin (80 mg/day; DF+A). Pigs were fed two meals per day and daily insulin injections were used in diabetic pigs to maintain plasma glucose between 250 and 350 mg/dl. Diabetic dyslipidemic (DF) pigs exhibited greater coronary atherosclerosis and increased collagen deposition in internal mammary artery compared with normoglycemic hyperlipidemic pigs. Although total and LDL CH concentrations did not differ, triglyceride (TG) were increased in DF pigs and FPLC analysis indicated that the LDL/HDL CH ratio was significantly increased in DF compared with HF pigs. The LDL fraction of DF pigs contained larger, lipid enriched particles resembling IDL. Consumption of the high fat/CH diet caused a moderate increase in the percentage of 14:0 fatty acids in plasma lipids and this was compensated by small-moderate declines in several unsaturated fatty acids. There was a significant increase in phospholipid arachidonic acid in DF compared with HF pigs. Atorvastatin protected diabetic pigs from atherosclerosis and decreased total and VLDL TG, but exerted minimal effects on the FPLC lipoprotein and plasma fatty acid profiles and plasma concentrations of total and LDL CH, vitamin A, vitamin E, and lysophosphatidylcholine. Across all groups the plasma CH concentration was positively correlated with hepatic CH concentration. These findings suggest that atorvastatin's protection against coronary artery atherosclerosis in diabetes may involve effects on plasma VLDL TG concentration. Lack of major effects on other lipid parameters, including the LDL/HDL ratio, suggests that atorvastatin may have yet other anti-atherogenic effects, possibly directly in the vessel wall.", 
    "76": "The effects of age and gender on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin (Crestor) were assessed in healthy young (18-35 years) and elderly (> 65 years) males and females in this open, nonrandomized, noncontrolled, parallel-group trial. Sixteen males and 16 females (8 young and elderly volunteers per gender group) were enrolled. Mean (range) ages were 24 (18-33) and 68 (65-73) years for young and elderly volunteers, respectively. Volunteers were given a single oral 40 mg dose of rosuvastatin. Blood samples for measurement of rosuvastatin plasma concentration were collected up to 96 hours following dosing. Age and gender effects were assessed by constructing 90% confidence intervals (CIs) around the ratios of young/elderly and male/female geometric least square means (glsmeans) for AUC(0-t) and Cmax (derived from ANOVA of log-transformed parameters). Small differences in rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics were noted between age and gender groups. Glsmean AUC(0-t) was 6% higher (90% CI = 0.86-1.30) and glsmean Cmax, 12% higher (90% CI = 0.83-1.51) in the young compared with the elderly group. Glsmean AUC(0-t) was 9% lower (90% CI = 0.74-1.12) and glsmean Cmax 18% lower (90% CI = 0.61-1.11) in the male compared with the female group. These small differences are not considered clinically relevant, and dose adjustments based on age or gender are not anticipated. Rosuvastatin was well tolerated in all volunteers.",

The effect of a short-term cholesterol-lowering treatment with atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on the levels of sICAM-1 and NO2-/NO3- were also investigated. After 4 weeks of placebo administration, 40 HCh (15 males and 25 females) were randomized in 2 groups: 20 subjects (atorvastatin group) received 10 mg/day of atorvastatin and the remaining 20 (placebo group) continued to take placebo. At baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks of atorvastatin or placebo administration, serum sICAM-1 and NO2-/NO3-levels were evaluated. The basal levels of these parameters were compared with those of 20 healthy subjects (C), matched for sex and age. Hypercholesterolemic subjects showed sICAM-1 and NO2-/NO3- basal values that were higher (331.7 +/- 60.3 ng/mL vs. 202.3 +/- 32.3 ng/mL, p<0.001) and lower (10.4 +/- 2.5 micromol/L vs. 20.7 +/- 4.4 micromol/L, p<0.01) than controls. No correlation between sICAM-1 or NO products and plasma cholesterol values was found, whereas there was an inverse correlation between sICAM-1 and NO2-/NO3- levels. Atorvastatin administration significantly decreased sICAM-1 and increased NO2-/NO3- levels, however these changes were not correlated with the reduction of plasma cholesterol. These data support the hypothesize that patients with HCh with no signs of arterial lesions, may have latent atherosclerosis, expressed as an increase of sICAM-1 and decrease in NO product levels. An improvement in the levels of these parameters after a short-time treatment with atorvastatin was also demonstrated.",

Only atorvastatin led to a significant reduction of LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Only fenofibrate increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Neither drug influenced lipoprotein(a). Mean LDL particle size increased both after fenofibrate (3.08%) and atorvastatin (1.77%). Fenofibrate increased serum homocysteine (HCY) by 36.5%. Atorvastatin had no effect on HCY. Only atorvastatin increased fibrinogen by 17.4%. Only fenofibrate reduced C-reactive protein by 51.7%. Neither drug influenced HOMA (homeostasis model assessment) index of insulin resistance.

The primary study end point is the change from baseline in plaque volume in a 30-mm segment of the coronary artery assessed by 3-dimensional IVUS. Several other IVUS and angiographic end points are measured.",

Upon oral administration, SIMV is quickly hydrolyzed to its beta-hydroxyacid and other acid metabolites, which are potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. A Tecan-based enzyme inhibition assay has been developed to improve the existing Zymark-based assay for the determination of both active and total concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in human plasma. A Tecan Genesis 200 robotic workstation equipped with eight probes and customized hardware was utilized to achieve higher sample throughput and improve assay reproducibility and mechanical stability. The developed enzyme inhibition assay was validated over two concentration ranges of 0.4-20 ng equivalent/mL, and 2-50 ng equivalent/mL. Intra- and interday precision data (coefficient of variation (CV)) for both concentration ranges were less than 9%, with an accuracy of 93-107%. The interday precision for the determination of quality control (QC) samples was less than 2% and 8%, respectively. The respective interday QC accuracy values were 93-103% and 97-104%. Good linearity across the two concentration ranges was observed, with acceptable reproducibility. This improved enzyme inhibition assay has been utilized to analyze human plasma samples from several clinical studies.", 
    "94": "Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death in industrialized nations. Hyperlipidemia with elevated serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides is a known major cardiovascular risk factor. HDL cholesterol is considered to be protective, so low HDL cholesterol is being recognized as an independent cardiovascular risk factor that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis and related adverse cardiovascular events. The recognition of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome is a step further in understanding these risk factors. Attempts at reducing serum cholesterol with different strategies in the past have met with limited success until the development of statins. The advent of statins has revolutionized the management of hyperlipidemia. The post-statins era has seen major clinical trials demonstrating the benefit of cholesterol reduction in the setting of both primary and secondary prevention. In general, there appears to be a 25% to 40% relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events such as death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The recent megatrials further suggest that aggressive management of cholesterol in patients with high cardiovascular risk may be beneficial. Though the concept of the-lower-the-better may be looming, the question of \"How low is good enough?\" remains controversial. The results of recent megatrials such as the Heart Protection Study go a step further than the NCEP guidelines and suggest that statin therapy may benefit patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease regardless of their baseline values. We summarize the results of the available large clinical trials in our understanding of the management of dyslipidemia in a setting of primary prevention.", 
    "95": "After menopause, most healthy women show an impairment of peripheral vasodilation and an increase of plasma cholesterol levels. Statins have been shown to improve endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic men and women. The present study tests whether atorvastatin (10 mg) influences endothelium-dependent vasodilation in postmenopausal normocholesterolemic women. Twenty-eight healthy, postmenopausal women (mean age 51 +/- 2 years) with serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol within the desirable range entered a double-blind, single-crossover study. Postmenopausal women were randomized to receive either atorvastatin (10 mg/day) or placebo for 10 days and then crossed to the complementary treatment. Endothelium-dependent and -independent responses were assessed by means of strain-gauge plethysmography before and after intra-arterial infusion of acethylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside, in comparison to physiologic saline. The nitric oxide pathway was evaluated by repeating the infusion of ACh during admininstration of L-arginine and (G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). Serum lipoproteins were not significantly modified by the active treatment. The vasodilation induced by ACh was significantly higher in the atorvastatin-treated women compared with the placebo-treated group (24 +/- 3 vs 13 +/- 2 ml/100 ml tissue/min, p <0.01). In contrast, responses to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside were not significantly modified by atorvastatin. The ACh-stimulated vasodilation induced by atorvastatin was additionally potentiated by L-arginine (800 +/- 105% vs 370 +/- 60%, p <0.05) and blunted by L-NMMA. No correlation was found between changes in plasma cholesterol and improvement in forearm blood flow. Our data show that the beneficial effect of atorvastatin on endothelium-dependent vasodilation is independent from changes in the lipid profile.", 
    "96": "The objective of this study was to evaluate whether plant sterol-ester margarine has an additive or interactive effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction when ingested in combination with a statin drug. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study with 4 parallel treatment arms in a balanced 2 x 2 factorial design. The 4 daily treatment options were: (1) placebo plus regular margarine 25 g (n = 38); (2) placebo plus sterol-ester margarine 25 g (2 g of plant sterol) (n = 39); (3) cerivastatin 400 microg plus regular margarine 25 g (n = 38); and (4) cerivastatin 400 microg plus sterol-ester margarine 25 g (n = 37). The study was conducted in men and women with primary hypercholesterolemia with baseline LDL cholesterol >/=97 mg/dl (mean 206). The primary efficacy parameter was the percent change in LDL cholesterol between baseline and at the end of 4 weeks' treatment. Cerivastatin (vs placebo) reduced LDL cholesterol by 32% (95% confidence intervals 28% to 36%, p <0.0001) and sterol-ester margarine (vs regular margarine) by 8% (95% confidence interval 4% to 12%, p <0.0001). The effect of sterol-ester margarine and cerivastatin together was additive (39% reduction in LDL cholesterol), but there was no significant interactive effect between sterol-ester margarine and cerivastatin (p = 0.29). The treatments were generally well tolerated with no major differences in adverse events between groups. In subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia, statin and sterol-ester margarine used together produce a purely additive effect on LDL cholesterol reduction. The addition of sterol-ester margarine to statin therapy offers LDL cholesterol reduction equivalent to doubling the dose of statin.", 
    "97": "Statins are regarded as efficacious in general but there is a wide variation in individual response. We sought demographic and lifestyle factors that influenced the response to pravastatin 40 mg/day in moderately hypercholesterolemic men in the West Of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS). Changes in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol after 6 months of treatment were examined in 1,604 highly compliant subjects. LDL cholesterol decreased by a mean of 30.4%. The magnitude of the change was influenced, albeit to a small extent, by baseline plasma triglyceride levels and alcohol intake and age; subjects with low plasma triglyceride levels, older subjects, and subjects with low alcohol intake had the greatest reductions. The mean response in HDL cholesterol in the group was an 8.3% increase (0.09 mmol/L). The percent increase in HDL cholesterol was affected by baseline HDL level, plasma triglyceride levels, decrease in plasma triglyceride levels during the administration of pravastatin, and body mass index. The absolute increase in HDL cholesterol was influenced by the decrease in plasma triglyceride levels, body mass index, and alcohol intake. All of these associations were weak (r <0.2) although highly significant. In conclusion, plasma lipid phenotype, obesity, and alcohol consumption appear to influence the response of LDL and HDL cholesterol to statin treatment. The absolute increment in HDL cholesterol is relatively constant across a range of baseline values, hence the percent change is largely a function of the starting value.", 
    "98": "The effects of atorvastatin at 20, 40, and 80 mg/day on plasma lipoprotein subclasses were examined in a randomized, placebo-controlled fashion over 24 weeks in 103 patients in the fasting state who had coronary heart disease (CHD) with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels >130 mg/dl. The effects of placebo and atorvastatin 40 mg/day were examined in 88 subjects with CHD in the fasting state and 4 hours after a meal rich in saturated fat and cholesterol. These findings were compared with results in 88 age- and gender-matched control subjects. Treatment at the 20, 40, and 80 mg/day dose levels resulted in LDL cholesterol reductions of 38%, 46%, and 52% (all p <0.0001), triglyceride reductions of 22%, 26%, and 30% (all p <0.0001), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increases of 6%, 5%, and 3%, respectively (all p <0.05 at the 20- and 40-mg doses). The lowest total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio was observed with the 80 mg/day dose of atorvastatin (p <0.0001 vs placebo). Remnant-like particle (RLP) cholesterol decreased 33%, 34%, and 32%, respectively (all p <0.0001). Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] cholesterol decreased 9%, 16%, and 21% (all p <0.0001), although Lp(a) mass increased 9%, 8%, and 10%, respectively (all p <0.01). In the fed state, atorvastatin 40 mg/day normalized direct LDL cholesterol (29% below controls), triglycerides (8% above controls), and RLP cholesterol (10% below controls), with similar reductions in the fasting state. At this same dose level, atorvastatin treatment resulted in 39%, 35%, and 59% decreases in fasting triglyceride in large, medium, and small very LDLs, as well as 45%, 33%, and 47% reductions in cholesterol in large, medium, and small LDL, respectively, as assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance (all significant, p <0.05), normalizing these particles versus controls (77 cases vs 77 controls). Moreover, cholesterol in large HDL was increased 37% (p <0.001) by this treatment. Our data indicate that atorvastatin treatment normalizes levels of all classes of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and LDL in both the fasting and fed states in patients with CHD compared with control subjects.",

    "100": "Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) is the most abundant biogenic hydrocarbon released from vegetation, and there is continuing interest in understanding its biosynthesis from photosynthetic precursors in leaf chloroplasts. We used on-line proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) to observe the kinetics of (13)C-labeling of isoprene following exposure to (13)CO(2) and then the loss of (13)C after a return to normal (12)CO(2) in oak ( Quercus agrifolia Nee) and cottonwood (Populus deltoides Barr.) leaves. Assignments of labeled isoprene species were verified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For the first time, it was possible to observe the half-lives of individually (13)C-labeled isoprene species during these transitions, and to trace some of the label to a C3 fragment that contained the two isoprene carbons derived from pyruvate via the deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) pathway. At steady state (under (13)CO(2)), approximately 80% of isoprene carbon was labeled, with fully labeled isoprene as the major species (approx. 60%). The source of the unlabeled C is suggested to be extrachloroplastic, but not from photorespiratory carbon. After a transfer to (12)CO(2), (13)C-labeling persisted in one isoprene carbon for several hours; this persistence was much more pronounced in (i) leaves inhibited by fosmidomycin, a specific inhibitor of the DOXP pathway, and (ii) in sun leaves which have higher ratios of soluble sugars to starch. From the mass 41-44 fragment data, and labeling predicted from the DOXP pathway in chloroplasts, precursors may arise from cytosolic pyruvate/phospho enolpyruvate equivalents transported into the chloroplast; this idea was supported by an indirect measure of pyruvate labeling. Other sources of cytosolic isoprene precursors (i.e. dimethylallyl diphosphate or pentose phosphate) could not be excluded. The data obtained shed light on the half-lives of photosynthetic metabolites, exchanges of carbon between cellular pools, and suggest multiple origins of isoprene precursors in leaves.",

    "106": "In a randomized, double-blind trial in 3086 patients with unstable angina pectoris or non-Q wave myocardial infarction we investigated if 80 mg of atorvastatin daily could improve outcome of cardiovascular events during a short period of time (16 weeks) compared with placebo. Baseline LDL cholesterol was 3.2 mmol L-1 (124 mg dL-1) and decreased by 40% to 1.9 mmol L-1 (72 mg dL-1) during atorvastatin treatment. The primary endpoint, which was a composite of death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest with resuscitation or recurrent symptomatic myocardial ischaemia with objective evidence and requiring emergency rehospitalization occurred in 228 patients (14.8%) in the atorvastatin group and 269 patients (17.4%) in the placebo group. The relative risk was 0.84 and 95% confidence interval was 0.70-1.00 (P = 0.048). Thus for patients with acute coronary syndromes, lipid-lowering therapy with high dose atorvastatin reduces recurrent ischaemic events in the short-term. A possible mechanism behind this rapid clinical effect induced by statin treatment is on inflammatory processes. Recent studies strongly suggest that acute T-cell activation is involved in the pathogenesis of unstable angina. In another study we investigated whether circulating T cells showed signs of activation in patients with stable angina pectoris (SA). Systemic venous blood samples were taken from 38 men with SA and 42 healthy controls. The T-cell receptor expression was assessed by three-colour flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies against CD3,CD4, CD8, CD25 and human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-DR. Soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) was measured as the circulating form in serum. Levels of circulating CD3+ and CD4+ T cells tended to be higher in patients compared with controls. Patients were also shown to have a significant increase in CD4+ T cells expressing the activation markers CD25 (P < 0.05) and HLA-DR (P < 0.01). Furthermore, serum levels of sIL-2R were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in patients than in controls. We also observed that the T-cell response was more pronounced in patients without simvastatin treatment (n = 18) compared with simvastatin-treated patients (n = 20). In conclusion, our findings indicate that a continuous immune system activation takes place in patients with chronic angina pectoris, predominantly involving proliferation of CD4+ T cells. Statin treatment seems to be able to decrease this inflammatory response.", 
    "107": "Proteoheparan sulphate can be adsorbed to a methylated silica surface in a monomolecular layer via its transmembrane hydrophobic protein core domain. As a result of electrostatic repulsion, its anionic glycosaminoglycan side chains are stretched out into the blood substitute solution, thereby representing one receptor site for specific lipoprotein binding through basic amino acid-rich residues within their apolipoproteins. The binding process was studied by ellipsometric techniques suggesting that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has a high binding affinity and a protective effect on interfacial heparan sulphate proteoglycan layers with respect to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and Ca2+ complexation. Low-density lipoprotein was found to deposit strongly at the proteoheparan sulphate-coated surface, particularly in the presence of Ca2+, apparently through complex formation 'proteoglycan-LDL-calcium'. This ternary complex build-up may be interpreted as arteriosclerotic nanoplaque formation on the molecular level responsible for the arteriosclerotic primary lesion. On the other hand, HDL bound to heparan sulphate proteoglycan protected against LDL deposition and completely suppressed calcification of the proteoglycan-lipoprotein complex. In addition, HDL was able to decelerate the ternary complex deposition. Therefore, HDL attached to its proteoglycan receptor sites is thought to raise a multidomain barrier, selection and control motif for transmembrane and paracellular lipoprotein uptake into the arterial wall. Although much remains unclear regarding the mechanism of lipoprotein depositions at proteoglycan-coated surfaces, it seems clear that the use of such systems offers possibilities for investigating lipoprotein deposition at a 'nanoscopic' level under close to physiological conditions. In particular, Ca2+-promoted LDL deposition and the protective effect of HDL even at high Ca2+ and LDL concentrations agree well with previous clinical observations regarding risk and beneficial factors for early stages of atherosclerosis. Considering this, the system was tested on its reliability in a biosensor application in order to unveil possible acute pleiotropic effects of the lipid lowering drug fluvastatin. The very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)/intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)/LDL plasma fraction from a high risk patient with dyslipoproteinaemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus showed beginning arteriosclerotic nanoplaque formation already at a normal blood Ca2+ concentration, with a strong increase at higher Ca2+ concentrations. Fluvastatin, whether applied to the patient (one single 80 mg slow release matrix tablet) or acutely in the experiment (2.2 micromol L-1), markedly slowed down this process of ternary aggregational nanoplaque complexation at all Ca2+ concentrations used. This action resulted without any significant change in lipid concentrations of the patient. Furthermore, after ternary complex build-up, fluvastatin, similar to HDL, was able to reduce nanoplaque adsorption and size. These immediate effects of fluvastatin have to be taken into consideration while interpreting the clinical outcome of long-term studies.",

Both drugs increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations after 16 weeks of treatment, with no significant difference between the two treatments. After 16 weeks of treatment, 93% of atorvastatin and 85% of simvastatin patients had achieved their National Cholesterol Education Program LDL-C goals.

This study looked for the effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors on NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide anion production in THP-1 cells, a monocyte-derived cell line, and on the translocation of p21 Rac 2 and p67. A 30-min incubation with simvastatin (50 micro M ) inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced superoxide anion production by monocytes (32%) and a maximum inhibition was obtained at 3 h of incubation (69.5%). In addition, after 3 h of incubation a dose-dependent inhibition was obtained in the range 10-50 micro M of simvastatin with a median inhibitory concentration of 36 +/- 2.3 micro M Mevalonic acid (100 and 300 micro M ) and geranylgeraniol (100 micro M ) totally prevented the simvastatin-induced inhibitory effect of superoxide production by monocytes whereas farnesyl PP (100 micro M ) partially prevented (50%) this effect. In addition, simvastatin inhibited the translocation of p21 rac 2 and p67, suggesting that geranylgeranylation is required for NADPH oxidase activation. In another set of experiments, the rank order of potency of different statins on NADPH oxidase was determined (pravastatin < cerivastatin < lovastatin < fluvastatin < simvastatin). In conclusion, inhibition of superoxide formation by HMG CoA reductase inhibitors is highly suitable to prevent or limit the oxidative stress involved in the atherosclerosis process.", 
    "122": "Recent research demonstrates that statin drugs exert a number of favorable effects on endothelial function, independent of lipid modulation, that appear to be mediated by a partial inhibition of prenylation reactions. Statin-induced suppression of PKC-evoked superoxide production may be attributable to an inhibition of rac prenylation and thus translocation that impedes activation of the membrane-bound NAD(P)H oxidase. Conversely, it is now known that hyperinsulinemia up-regulates prenylation reactions by boosting the activities of isoprenyl transferases. In light of new evidence that hyperinsulinemia stimulates endothelial superoxide production via NAD(P)H oxidase, it is tempting to conclude that up-regulation of rac prenylation is at least partially responsible for this phenomenon. In patients afflicted with insulin resistance syndrome, this adverse impact of hyperinsulinemia may be exacerbated by an excessive free fatty acid flux that activates endothelial PKC - another stimulant of the NAD(P)H oxidase - while impeding insulin-mediated activation of nitric oxide synthase. The resulting imbalance of endothelial nitric oxide and superoxide production may be responsible for much of the excess vascular risk associated with this syndrome.", 
    "123": "1. The pharmacokinetics and disposition of rosuvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, were investigated following single administration of (14)C-rosuvastatin in the Sprague-Dawley rat. 2. Following oral administration of (14)C-rosuvastatin at 1, 5 and 25 mg kg(-1), the C(max) and AUC of the radioactivity in the plasma increased more than the increase in dose ratio. 3. Excretion of radioactivity was 98.0% of the dose in the faeces and 0.4% in the urine up to 168 h after oral administration in the intact rat, and was 55.1% in the bile and 0.5% in the urine up to 48 h post-dosing in the bile duct-cannulated rat. The unchanged compound mainly accounted for the radioactivity in the bile and faeces. 4. In the tissue distribution study, the concentration of the radioactivity in the liver was markedly higher than those in the other tissues, and the radioactivity concentration ratios of the liver to the plasma were between 8 and 25 up to 48 h after oral administration. The liver-specific distribution of rosuvastatin was similarly recognized in whole-body autoradiography. 5. Metabolic profiling studies indicated that rosuvastatin would not be metabolized by CYP enzymes. 6. These results clarified that rosuvastatin selectively distributed in the liver - the target organ - and was excreted in the bile mainly as the unchanged compound.", 
    "124": "Individuals without overt coronary heart disease (CHD) may nevertheless be at significant risk for future CHD events based on lipid and other risk factors. Recognition of this fact is reflected in the inclusion of measures of global risk in current CHD prevention guidelines. Given the fact that many patients in the primary prevention setting fail to achieve target lipid levels, simplicity of treatment can be considered to be of great importance. Drug treatment that can improve achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets and produce beneficial effects on other lipid risk factors at starting doses would be of considerable utility in this setting. A new statin, rosuvastatin, has been shown to produce greater reductions in LDL-C and to permit more patients to reach target levels than currently available statins, and has also demonstrated favorable effects on other lipid variables. Rosuvastatin may thus be a prime candidate for use in clinical practice to achieve the lipid goals recommended in guidelines for primary prevention of CHD.", 
    "125": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a hereditary metabolic disorder characterised by defects in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and an extremely high risk for premature cardiovascular disease. Heterozygous FH occurs in about one of every 500 individuals in the United States and Europe. The high prevalence of FH and associated morbidity and mortality strongly support aggressive screening and treatment. There are two major barriers to effective management of FH: 1) the failure to screen for this disease in people who may be at increased risk for it; and 2) the inability of most available therapies to enable achievement of LDL-C goals. More aggressive screening, coupled with new genetic screening techniques, and more powerful 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have the potential to overcome these limitations. Automated genetic assays are now available for detection of common LDL receptor mutations in individuals at risk for FH, and they have been used effectively to identify patients with this condition. Recent clinical trial results with the new synthetic statin rosuvastatin (Crestor; AstraZeneca, Alderley Park, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK; licensed from Shionogi & Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan) in patients with heterozygous FH have shown that it decreased LDL-C by 58% and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by 12%. Rosuvastatin was significantly superior to high-dose atorvastatin in improving these lipid parameters as well as total cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) B, apo A-I, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Thus, new screening tools and medical therapies have the potential to significantly improve management and reduce cardiovascular disease risk for patients with FH.",

Interestingly, changes were similar between the hypercholesterolaemic patients and the young and the age-matched control individuals (DeltaRPF 100 mg/kg/30 min, 40+/-51 ml/min vs 40+/-52 ml/min, P=NS; DeltaRPF 500 mg/kg/30 min, 114+/-85 ml/min vs 130+/-78 ml/min, P=NS). L-arginine significantly lowered systemic arterial pressure and increased heart rate in all groups. Despite significant reductions in LDL-cholesterol levels (291+/-35 mg/dl vs 213+/-30 mg/dl, P<0.001), treatment with fluvastatin did not alter the renal haemodynamic response pattern to L-arginine infusion when compared to baseline values and to those with placebo.", 
    "129": "In contrast to studies performed in the vasculature of the human forearm or the coronary circulation, our results suggest that hypercholesterolaemia is not associated with an impaired L-arginine-induced renal vascular relaxation.", 
    "130": "This report describes the effect of intensive cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin on the incidence of nonfatal stroke, a secondary end point, in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. The primary end point, a composite of death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or recurrent symptomatic myocardial ischemia with objective evidence requiring emergency rehospitalization, was reduced from 17.4% in the placebo group to 14.8% in the atorvastatin group over the 16 weeks of the trial (P=0.048).", 
    "131": "Strokes were adjudicated by a blinded end-point committee using standard clinical and imaging criteria. The outcomes of nonfatal stroke and fatal plus nonfatal stroke were analyzed by time to first occurrence during the 16-week trial. Of 38 events (in 36 patients) adjudicated as fatal or nonfatal strokes, 3 were classified as hemorrhagic, one as embolic, and 29 as thrombotic or embolic; 5 could not be categorized. Nonfatal stroke occurred in 9 patients in the atorvastatin group and 22 in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.40; 95% confidence intervals, 0.19 to 0.88; P=0.02). Fatal or nonfatal stroke occurred in 12 atorvastatin patients and 24 placebo patients (relative risk, 0.49; 95% confidence intervals, 0.24 to 0.98; P=0.04). All 3 hemorrhagic strokes occurred in the placebo group.", 
    "132": "Intensive cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin over 16 weeks in patients with acute coronary syndromes reduced the overall stroke rate by half and did not cause hemorrhagic stroke. These findings need to be confirmed in future trials.", 
    "133": "Rosuvastatin is a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with dyslipidaemia. Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolised and has a low propensity for drug interactions. In well designed trials of between 6 and 52 weeks' duration, rosuvastatin was superior to atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin in improving the lipid profile of patients with hypercholesterolaemia. In a 1-year dose-titration study, rosuvastatin 13.4mg daily (mean dose) allowed more patients to achieve US National Cholesterol Education Program (Adult Treatment panel II)[NCEP] target low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels than atorvastatin 20.8mg daily (98 vs 87%) with the difference most marked in high-risk patients (97 vs 61%). Similarly, when compared with pravastatin and simvastatin 20 mg/day in a further 1-year trial, 88% of rosuvastatin recipients [9.5 and 13.8 mg/day (mean doses)] achieved NCEP target serum LDL-cholesterol levels compared with 60 and 73% of pravastatin and simvastatin recipients, respectively, with the difference more marked in high-risk patients. In further clinical trials, rosuvastatin improved the lipid profile of patients with heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia or mixed dyslipidaemias. Rosuvastatin was well tolerated in clinical trials of up to 1 years' duration.", 
    "134": "An evident fatty liver, corroborated morphologically and chemically, was produced in CD-1 mice after five daily doses of simvastatin 75 mg/Kg body weight, a hypercholesterolemic diet and 20 percent ethanol in the drinking water. After treating the animals, they presented serum triacylglycerols levels five times higher than the control mice, total lipids, cholesterol and triacylglycerols in the liver were 2, 2 and 1.5 times higher, respectively, than in control animals. When Arthrospira maxima was given with diet two weeks prior the onset of fatty liver induction, there was a decrement of liver total lipids (40%), liver triacylglycerols (50%) and serum triacylglycerols (50%) compared to the animals with the same treatment but without Arthrospira maxima. In addition to the mentioned protective effect, the administration of this algae, produced a significant increase (45%) in serum high density lipoproteins. The mechanism for this protective effect was not established in these experiments.", 
    "135": "The introduction of the hydroxy methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in 1987 was a major advance in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Several landmark clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of lipid lowering with statins for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), namely The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), Cholesterol And Recurrent Events (CARE), Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID), West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) and Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS). Although it is widely accepted that the majority of clinical benefit obtained with statins is a direct result of their lipid-lowering properties, these agents appear to display additional cholesterol-independent or pleiotropic effects on various aspects of cardiovascular disease, including improving endothelial function, decreasing vascular inflammation and enhancing plaque stability. Although the full impact of statin therapy on each of these processes is not fully understood, ongoing studies with current and new statins are likely to shed further light on the potential cholesterol-independent benefits of these agents."
