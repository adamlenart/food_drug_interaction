    "0": "The Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) study was designed when considerable disagreement existed as to relative benefits and risks of cholesterol reduction. Between June 1990 and December 1992, 9,014 patients aged 31-75 years were randomized to receive either pravastatin 40 mg once daily or placebo. These patients had experienced either acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina within the preceding 3 months to 3 years and had total cholesterol levels of 155-271 mg/dl (4.0-7.0 mmol/liter). All patients received dietary advice. The LIPID study is projected for conclusion in 1997, after a follow-up period of at least 5 years. The primary study endpoint is mortality due to coronary artery disease (CAD). The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) is the first secondary prevention trial to show a reduction in total mortality with lipid-lowering therapy. However, the LIPID study should continue for the following reasons: (1) important differences exist between the LIPID study and 4S cohorts. Overall, > 80% of the LIPID patients could not have been included in 4S on the basis of their cholesterol level, age, or history of CAD; (2) the LIPID study will also provide important information on noncoronary mortality and on other groups, such as women and diabetic patients, who have been underrepresented in previous trials; (3) the LIPID study design allows for clinical management, including lipid-lowering therapy, to be at the discretion of the physician managing a trial patient. The 4S results have been brought to the attention of all LIPID investigators, Institutional Ethics Committees, the physicians of the individual patients, and the patients themselves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "A sample of 42 randomized cholesterol-lowering trials represented by 32 data points were subjected to a metaregression analysis. The logarithmic odds ratio (InOR) of total mortality outcome or incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) were used as dependent variables and regressed against the net amount of total cholesterol reduction between treatment groups in each trial. Analyses were weighted by variance of OR. Adjustments were also made for single and multifactor trials and for total mortality risk level in the control/placebo group as well as for treatment modality. Analyses were performed both with and without inclusion of trials using 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors as treatment modality. A statistically significant dose-response relationship was found between InOR and the amount of cholesterol reduction for both endpoints and in both groups of trials. These findings were essentially unaltered by various adjustments for potential confounders or by various sensitivity analyses. The results of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) fell close to the regression lines for both outcome measures, and inclusion of other statin trials strengthened the significance of this dose-response compared with previous metaregression analyses without inclusion of statin trials. The type of treatment was significantly associated with both endpoints. Fibrate trials did significantly worse on all-cause mortality than statin trials and other drug trials (except hormone). The baseline cholesterol level was also significantly predictive of CAD incidence as a trial outcome; efficacy increased with increased level of baseline cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Overall, 72% of pravastatin-treated patients achieved reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in excess of 20%, and 44% attained declines in excess of 30% (both P < .01 vs placebo). Pravastatin was generally well tolerated in this population, with one patient (0.5%) exhibiting a reversible myopathy with creatine kinase elevations to 10 times the upper limit of normal. No substantial elevations of aminotransferase levels of two to three times the upper limit of normal occurred in either the pravastatin or the placebo group. Drug compliance was high, exceeding 90%.",

The gene (cytP-450sca-2) encoding CytP-450sca-2 was cloned from Sc. The gene had an open reading frame of 1233 bp, encoding a 410-amino-acid protein. The partial sequencing of the purified CytP-450sca-2 revealed that the N-terminal Met had been removed. CytP-450sca-2 contained the heme-binding HR2 region characteristic of all CytP-450, as well as the putative oxygen-binding site proposed in CytP-450cam from Pseudomonas putida. ML-236B.Na enhanced transcription of cytP-450sca-2, suggesting that substrate induction in Sc is transcriptionally regulated. S. lividans (Sl) transfected with cytP-450sca-2 converted ML-236B.Na to pravastatin, indicating the cloned gene to be functional in Sl.", 
    "7": "A molecular mechanism for the intestinal monocarboxylic acid transport was characterized by using a proton/monocarboxylate transporter, MCT1, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, first found by Garcia et al. (Cell, 76, 865-873, 1994). Northern blotting analysis showed that MCT1-isomers exist in the rat and rabbit intestinal enterocytes and Caco-2 cells. The expression of [14C]lactic acid uptake by Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with rabbit intestinal mRNA was reduced by hybridizing the mRNA with a MCT1 cDNA of CHO cells before microinjection used as the antisense DNA. [14C]Lactic acid uptake by CHO cells was pH dependent, saturable, stereospecific, and reduced in the presence of acetic acid, benzoic acid, S- and R-ibuprofen, S- and R-mandelic acid, nicotinic acid, pravastatin, propionic acid and valproic acid. In addition, several monocarboxylic acids were transported in pH-dependent and saturable manners. These results suggest that the intestinal MCT1-related protein contributes to a carrier-mediated absorption for organic weak acid compounds.",

Pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective and safe in lowering cholesterol levels after cardiac transplantation. Cell-culture studies using inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase have suggested an immunosuppressive effect.",

There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence of mild or moderate episodes of cardiac rejection. In a subgroup of study patients, intracoronary ultrasound measurements at base line and one year after transplantation showed less progression in the pravastatin group in maximal intimal thickness (0.11 +/- 0.09 mm, vs. 0.23 +/- 0.16 mm in the control group; P = 0.002) and in the intimal index (0.05 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.10, P = 0.031).

    "12": "Thirty-four (34) subjects with primary hyperlipidaemia were enrolled for this study. After low fat dietary therapy for 6 weeks, subjects' whose serum total cholesterol fell to below 6.2 mmol/l (11 subjects) were excluded from the study and those whose serum total cholesterol were 6.2 mmol/l or more (23 subjects) were started on pravastatin 10 mg nocte. After 8 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in the mean total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. However 13 of the subjects still had serum total cholesterol 6.2 mmol/l or more and their pravastatin dose was increased to 20 mg nocte. After 12 weeks, there was a significant reduction in triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. There was also a significant increase in HDL-cholesterol. The triglyceride fell by a mean of 15.7%, total cholesterol by a mean of 18.1% and LDL-cholesterol by a mean of 26.3%. HDL-cholesterol on the other hand, increased by 19.4%. The subjects whose total cholesterol fell below 6.2 mmol/l at week 8 had significantly lower total cholesterol to begin with than those whose total cholesterol failed to do so and hence were commenced on 20 mg pravastatin. This suggests that the optimum dose of the drug is dependent on the initial level of total cholesterol. We conclude that pravastatin is effective as a lipid lowering agent.", 
    "13": "Hyperlipidemia associated with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and insulin resistance is characterized by high triglyceride levels; raised levels of total low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which is made up of small, dense, cholesterol-rich particles; low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL); and glycosylation of apolipoproteins. Optimal drug therapy for this lipid profile is controversial. To test whether a fibrinic acid derivative (gemfibrozil) or a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (lovastatin) would produce better results in these patients, a crossover study was performed. Gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily and, after a washout period, lovastatin 20 to 40 mg twice daily were administered to nine patients with NIDDM. Gemfibrozil significantly decreased triglyceride, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) levels, the total cholesterol:HDL ratio, and the IDL plus VLDL;HDL ratio, and significantly increased levels of HDL, HDL2, and HDL3. Lovastatin significantly decreased levels of total cholesterol, calculated LDL, directly measured LDL, IDL, total triglycerides, VLDL, and the ratios of LDL:HDL, total cholesterol:HDL, and directly measured LDL:HDL and significantly increased total HDL and HDL3 levels. Gemfibrozil was significantly more effective than lovastatin in raising total HDL and HDL3 levels and in lowering the IDL plus VLDL:HDL ratio. Lovastatin was significantly more effective than gemfibrozil in lowering total cholesterol, LDL, directly measured LDL, and the LDL:HDL and directly measured LDL:HDL ratios. In the absence of malignant hypertriglyceridemia, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, rather than a fibrinic acid derivative, is indicated for the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia associated with NIDDM and insulin resistance.", 
    "14": "The effects of pravastatin on plasma lipid levels, in vitro oxidizability of the non-HDL fraction, metabolic control, urinary albumin excretion, and four serum enzymes (SGPT, SGOT, GT and CPK) were studied in 20 insulin-dependent diabetic patients (IDDM) with incipient nephropathy. The patients were divided into two groups and the study was carried out by a crossover design. After 12 weeks pravastatin treatment (20 mg daily), plasma cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (Apo B) decreased by 22, 19 and 15%, respectively. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formation and the oxidation lagtime of the non-HDL fraction during the in vitro incubation with copper were not changed before and after treatment. The HbA1c and blood glucose levels, urinary albumin excretion, SGOT, SGPT and GT were not influenced by pravastatin treatment. CPK activity was elevated after 12 weeks of pravastatin treatment, and this elevation persisted even after the 12 weeks placebo period. So, pravastatin could be used as an effective drug for IDDM patients with incipient nephropathy, but close monitoring of the CPK activity is recommended.",

    "21": "Changes in total and LDL cholesterol levels in the validation study were expected based on established effects of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, but changes in these levels in lovastatin-cookie study were not expected. They could have occurred because lovastatin reversed the effect of saturated fats and enhanced the effect of unsaturated fats. Alternatively, they may have been due to enhanced bioavailability of lovastatin when administered with a high-fat diet. These findings must be confirmed.", 
    "22": "The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27 binds and inhibits the kinase activity of several CDKs. Here we report an analysis of the behavior and partners of p27 in Swiss 3T3 mouse fibroblasts during normal mitotic cell cycle progression, as well as in cells arrested at different stages in the cycle by growth factor deprivation, lovastatin treatment, or ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. We found that the level of p27 is elevated in cells arrested in G0 by growth factor deprivation or contact inhibition. In G0, p27 was predominantly monomeric, although some portion was associated with residual cyclin A.Cdk2. During G1, all of p27 was associated with cyclin D1.Cdk4 and was then redistributed to cyclin A.Cdk2 as cells entered S phase. The loss of the monomeric p27 pool as cyclins accumulate in G1 is consistent with the in vivo and in vitro data showing that p27 binds better to cyclin.CDK complexes than to monomeric CDKs. In growing cells, the majority of p27 was associated with cyclin D1 and the level of p27 was significantly lower than the level of cyclin D1. In cells arrested in G1 with lovastatin, cyclin D1 was degraded and p27 was redistributed to cyclin A.Cdk2. In contrast to p21 (which is a p27-related CDK inhibitor and is induced by UV irradiation), the level of p27 was reduced after UV irradiation, but because cyclin D1 was degraded more rapidly than p27, there was a transient increase in binding of p27 to cyclin A.Cdk2. These data suggest that cyclin D1.Cdk4 acts as a reservoir for p27, and p27 is redistributed from cyclin D1.Cdk4 to cyclin A.Cdk2 complexes during S phase, or when cells are arrested by growth factor deprivation, lovastatin treatment, or UV irradiation. It is likely that a similar principle of redistribution of p27 is used by the cell in other instances of cell cycle arrest.", 
    "23": "1. Effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, pravastatin and simvastatin, on the myocardial level of coenzyme Q10, and on mitochondrial respiration were examined in dogs. 2. Either vehicle (control), pravastatin (4 mg kg-1 day-1), or simvastatin (2 mg kg-1 day-1) was administered orally for 3 weeks. First, the myocardial tissue level of coenzyme Q10 was determined in the 3 groups. Second, ischaemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in anaesthetized open chest dogs, pretreated with the inhibitors. After 30 min of ischaemia, nonischaemic and ischaemic myocardium were removed from the left circumflex and LAD regions, respectively, and immediately used for isolation of mitochondria. The mitochondrial respiration was determined by polarography, with glutamate and succinate used as substrates. 3. Simvastatin significantly decreased the myocardial level of coenzyme Q10, but pravastatin did not. 4. Ischaemia decreased the mitochondrial respiratory control index (RCI) in both groups. Significant differences in RCI between nonischaemic and ischaemic myocardium were observed in the control and simvastatin-treated groups. 5. Only in the simvastatin-treated group did ischaemia significantly decrease the ADP/O ratio, determined with succinate. 6. The present results indicate that simvastatin but not pravastatin may cause worsening of the myocardial mitochondrial respiration during ischaemia, probably because of reduction of the myocardial coenzyme Q10 level.", 
    "24": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) results from genetic defects in the LDL receptor, and is characterized by a marked elevation in plasma LDL and by qualitative abnormalities in LDL particles. Because LDL particles are major acceptors of cholesteryl esters (CEs) from HDL, significant changes occur in the flux of CE through the reverse cholesterol pathway. To evaluate the effects of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, on CE transfer from HDL to apo B-containing lipoproteins and on plasma lipoprotein subspecies profile in subjects with heterozygous FH, we investigated the transfer of HDL-CE to LDL subfractions and changes in both concentration and chemical composition of the apo B- and the apo AI-containing lipoproteins. After pravastatin treatment (40 mg/d) for a 12-week period, plasma LDL concentrations (mean +/- SD, 745.4 +/- 51.9 mg/dL) were reduced by 36% in patients with FH (n = 6). By contrast, the qualitative features of the density profile of LDL subspecies in patients with FH, in whom the intermediate (d = 1.029 to 1.039 g/mL) and dense (d = 1.039 to 1.063 g/mL) subspecies were significantly increased relative to a control group, were not modified by pravastatin. In addition, no significant effect on the chemical composition of individual LDL subfractions was observed. Furthermore, plasma HDL concentrations were not modified, although the density distribution of HDL was normalized. Indeed, the HDL density peak was shifted towards the HDL2 subfraction (ratios of HDL2 to HDL3 were 0.7 and 1.1 before and after treatment, respectively). Evaluation of plasma CE transfer protein (CETP) mass was performed with an exogenous CE transfer assay. Under these conditions, no modification of plasma CETP protein mass was induced by pravastatin administration. However, the rate of CE transfer from HDL to LDL was reduced by 24% by pravastatin (61 +/- 17 micrograms CE.h-1.mL-1 plasma; P < .0005), although intermediate and dense LDL subfractions again accounted for the majority (71%) of the total CE transferred to LDL. Thus, pravastatin induced reduction of plasma CETP activity without change in the preferential targeting of the transfer of HDL-CE towards the denser LDL subfractions. In conclusion, pravastatin reduces the elevated flux of CE from HDL to apo B-containing lipoproteins in subjects with heterozygous FH as a result of a reduction in the LDL particle acceptor concentration.", 
    "25": "We previously reported that mevalonate starvation elicited by hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors reduced cholesterol accumulation promoted in murine macrophages by acetylated LDL (AcLDL). In the present study we investigated the cellular mechanism of this effect. Our results indicate that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors fluvastatin and simvastatin reduce, in a concentration-dependent manner, more than 50% of the 125I-AcLDL degradation by macrophages. This effect was not due to a decrease of lysosomal enzyme activity, and it was paralleled by the retention of AcLDL-associated cholesteryl ester in the incubation medium. The ability of fluvastatin to inhibit AcLDL degradation was completely overcome by mevalonate and its derivative geranylgeraniol. Evaluation at 4 degrees C of 125I-AcLDL binding to plasma membrane suggested that the inhibitory effect of fluvastatin on lipoprotein catabolism was not due to a decreased expression of scavenger receptors. Fluorescent microscope analysis of cellular internalization of AcLDL labeled with the fluorochrome 3,3'-dioctadecyl indocarbocyanine demonstrated that fluvastatin inhibits lipoprotein endocytosis, an effect reversed by mevalonate. Studies performed with native 125I-LDL indicated that fluvastatin did not inhibit but rather increased the degradation of LDL taken up by the normal LDL receptor. These results exclude a generalized depression of the cellular endocytotic activity by the drug. The ability of fluvastatin to reduce AcLDL catabolism and cholesterol esterification was more pronounced in cholesterol-enriched macrophages compared with normal cells. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may reduce the in vitro cholesterol accumulation in macrophages by inhibiting AcLDL endocytosis.", 
    "26": "The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of pravastatin in a primary prevention context. The primary end point of the trial is definite coronary artery disease (CAD) death and/or nonfatal acute myocardial infarction. This study describes the baseline characteristics of the trial recruits and of the subjects who were screened during the recruitment process; 6,595 men, aged 45 to 64 years, with raised cholesterol levels, were randomized in equal numbers to placebo or pravastatin after initial screening of approximately 81,000 subjects in the West of Scotland. With the exception of cholesterol levels and history of CAD, the recruits had a similar risk factor profile and demographic distribution to the group of screenees from which they were selected. Compared with previous primary prevention studies of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the WOSCOPS recruits are, on average, 7 to 9 years older than subjects in other trials and have average total cholesterol levels 0.5 mmol/L (19.4 mg/dl) lower than those in the Helsinki Heart Study and the Lipid Research Clinics-Coronary Primary Prevention Trial. The study has achieved its initial goal of accumulating > 30,000 patient-years of randomized follow-up.

    "27": "This study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of 3 different pharmacologic lipid-lowering regimens in the treatment of patients with clustered lipid risk factors. Sixty-five patients with low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and hypertriglyceridemia were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: pravastatin/niacin, pravastatin/magnesium, or pravastatin/placebo. After 18 weeks, patients in the pravastatin/niacin group had a -41% change in the total cholesterol/HDL ratio compared with -13% in the pravastatin/magnesium arm and -16% in the pravastatin/placebo group. The HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions, as well as the apolipoprotein A-I levels, were increased significantly only in the pravastatin/niacin arm. The levels of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL3) were decreased to a greater extent in the pravastatin/niacin arm (-43%) than in either the pravastatin/magnesium (-13%) or the pravastatin/placebo (-20%) arm. Only the pravastatin/niacin regimen significantly diminished postprandial lipemia (-32% change in the remnant particle triglyceride concentration and decreased very-low-density lipoprotein remnant levels). Thus, in this group of patients with clustered risk factors, the combination of pravastatin and niacin resulted in significant improvements in HDL and triglyceride levels, total cholesterol to HDL ratio, small dense LDL levels, and postprandial lipemia. Pravastatin alone or in combination with magnesium resulted in less significant changes that were largely limited to LDL cholesterol reduction.",

Each group receives dietary advice according to National Heart Foundation guidelines. Individual care of each patient is otherwise left to the discretion of the patient's usual doctor. The study has a primary outcome of coronary mortality, and is designed to detect an 18% reduction with 80% power. From April 1990 to September 1992, 11,106 patients were registered, and following the run-in phase, 9,014 were randomized: 5,754 (64%) after a qualifying event of AMI and 3,260 (36%) after hospitalization for UAP. The randomized population includes relatively large numbers in subgroups not assessed reliably in earlier trials: 1,511 women, 3,516 patients aged > or = 65 years, 777 diabetics, and 3,829 patients with serum cholesterol < or = 5.5 mmol/L (213 mg/dl) at baseline. With a projected 700 fatal coronary events, the trial should be able to detect important reductions in coronary mortality and contribute substantially to prospective meta-analyses to detect effects on total mortality. The spectrum of patients being assessed will improve the reliability of evidence for the benefits and risks of cholesterol-lowering therapies in patients with lower cholesterol levels and in other important subgroups.", 
    "29": "Proliferation of tubular epithelial cells is a major element leading to cyst formation in Han:SPRD rats with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD). ras proteins are important in the control of renal cell proliferation, and ras gene expression is increased in PKD. Farnesyl pyrophosphate, an intermediate in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to cholesterol, is required for the activation of ras guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins that are important in the execution of several cellular functions, including cell proliferation. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, such as lovastatin, reduce farnesyl production in responsive cells and thereby have potential for ameliorating the accelerated epithelial cell proliferation of PKD. We administered lovastatin to heterozygous (Cy/+) Han:SPRD rats (4 mg/kg/d subcutaneously) from age 4 to 10 weeks, a period of rapid cystic disease progression in these animals. Untreated male Cy/+ rats developed larger cystic kidneys and had more severe renal functional impairment than females, as reported previously. In males, lovastatin significantly decreased cystic kidney size (referenced to body weight), the volume density of cysts, and the serum urea nitrogen level 14.5%, 24.4%, and 25.6/%, respectively. The corresponding changes in females were insignificant, and lovastatin had no effect on kidney weight or serum urea nitrogen in homozygous (+/+) normal male animals. On the basis of these results we conclude that lovastatin diminishes the severity of PKD in heterozygous male Han:SPRD rats.",

    "31": "Young rats were treated with lovastatin, a drug that increases transcripts of the HMGR gene and translation of HMGR mRNA in lens secondary to inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. The relative concentration of HMGR mRNA in lens epithelium and superficial cortex was estimated by a competitive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction system. Relative HMGR protein levels were estimated by Western blot analysis. Because lovastatin is cleared rapidly from the lens, the half-life of HMGR protein in epithelium and cortex was estimated by following the disappearance of the increased pool of enzyme protein from each compartment with time after halting drug treatment.", 
    "32": "Between 75% and 90% of the total content of HMGR mRNA and protein in the epithelium and the superficial cortex of control rat lens was located in the cortex. Treatment with lovastatin increased the content of the mRNA in epithelium and cortex by approximately 0.4-fold and HMGR protein content approximately 5-fold. Although the concentration of HMGR mRNA and protein was similarly increased in epithelium and superficial cortex, approximately 85% to 90% of the total increase in mRNA and protein content was located in the cortex because of that area's greater mass. The half-life for the disappearance of the increased pool of HMGR protein from epithelium and cortex was similar at approximately 14 to 17 hours.", 
    "33": "The bulk of HMGR gene transcription and mRNA translation apparently is confined to elongating fiber cells. The 10-fold greater increase in enzyme protein than mRNA levels after lovastatin treatment indicates that enzyme concentration in lens is controlled mainly by effects on HMGR mRNA translation or rates of HMGR proteolysis. The observed rapid turnover of enzyme protein in the epithelium and the superficial cortex, if applicable to the deeper cortex and the homeostatic state (absence of drug exposure), suggests that the gradual disappearance of HMGR protein from the lens could be caused by waning of enzyme synthesis rather than to proteolysis in the absence of continuing enzyme synthesis.", 
    "34": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was measured in fibroblasts incubated with large (Sf > 60) and small (Sf 20-60) very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, at similar protein concentrations, from young post-infarction patients and healthy controls. The results showed that apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL, LDL) from patients suppressed HMG-CoA reductase activity to a similar extent compared to apo B-containing lipoproteins from controls. When all subjects taken together were grouped according to triglyceride levels, it was found that small VLDL from hypertriglyceridaemic individuals suppressed the HMG-CoA reductase activity more than small VLDL from normotriglyceridaemic individuals. The opposite pattern was seen for LDL. The lipoprotein composition was related to the respective HMG-CoA reductase activity. In addition to a positive association between the cholesterol content of small VLDL and LDL, and the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity, the apo C I and C II content of small VLDL and IDL was inversely related to the suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity. This study shows that the cellular processing of apo B-containing lipoproteins in young post-infarction patients and healthy controls is heterogeneous and dependent on the composition of the lipoprotein.",

Dose-response curves for serotonin-induced vasodilatation, an index of nitric oxide-dependent vasodilatation, showed a comparable and significant rightward shift after a medication-free period of 2 and 6 weeks compared with control subjects, indicating endothelial dysfunction, which was already maximum after 2 weeks. After 12 weeks of lipid-lowering medication, the difference in endothelial function between controls and patients had disappeared. Co-infusion of L-arginine, the substrate for nitric oxide synthase, returned the impaired serotonin response during hypercholesterolaemia to normal, but had no effect on this response in controls or in patients while on lipid-lowering medication. Neither endothelium-independent vasorelaxation, assessed by sodium nitroprusside infusion, nor vasoconstriction induced by the nitric oxide blocker L-NMMA, were different between controls and patients, whether the latter were on or off lipid-lowering medication. Our results show an L-arginine-sensitive, impaired nitric-oxide-mediated vascular relaxation of forearm resistance vessels in hypercholesterolaemia which is reproducible, and reversible after short-term lipid-lowering therapy. Demonstration of such changes in this readily accessible vascular bed will allow larger trials assessing vascular function during lipid-lowering therapy to be done.", 
    "37": "Herpesvirus infection of arterial smooth muscle cells has been shown to cause cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation. However, the effects of human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection on cholesterol binding and internalization, intracellular metabolism, and efflux have not been evaluated. In addition, the effects of viral infection on signal transduction pathways that impact upon cholesterol metabolism have not been studied. We show in studies reported herein that HSV-1 infection of arterial smooth muscle cells enhances low density lipoprotein (LDL) binding and uptake which parallels an increase in LDL receptor steady state mRNA levels and transcription of the LDL receptor gene. HSV-2 also increases CE synthesis and 3-hydroxy- 3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity but concomitantly reduces CE hydrolysis and cholesterol efflux. Interestingly, this viral infection was associated with a time-dependent decrease in protein kinase A activity and an increase in viral-induced protein kinase (VPK) activity commensurate with the accumulation of esterified cholesterol. The relationship between increased VPK activity and alterations in CE accumulation in virally infected cells was explored using an HSV-1 VPK- mutant in which the portion of the HSV-1 genome encoding VPK had been deleted. Cholesteryl ester accumulation was significantly increased (> 50-fold) in HSV-1-infected cells compared to uninfected cells. However, the HSV-1 VPK- mutant had no significant effect on CE accumulation. The relationship between VPK activity and these alterations in cholesterol metabolism was further supported by the observation that staurosporine and calphostin C (protein kinase inhibitors) reduced protein kinase activity in HSV-1-infected cells. These results suggest several potential mechanisms by which alterations in kinase activities in response to HSV-1 infection of vascular cells may alter cholesterol trafficking processes that eventually lead to CE accumulation.", 
    "38": "The effect of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) inhibitor lovastatin on the UVA-induced photocytotoxicity has been investigated in cultured human N.C.T.C. 2544 keratinocytes. In the absence of irradiation, 5 x 10(-7) M lovastatin did not exhibit any significant cytotoxic effect towards this cell line. Although the drug cannot act as a photosensitizer, because it does not absorb in the UVA range, it markedly increased the UVA-induced cellular damage (about 70% reduction in cell viability at 5 x 10(-7) M). This effect was not accompanied by an increase in the lipid peroxidation product content of cells as compared with treatment with UVA alone. Medium supplementation with 0.01 mg/ml free cholesterol totally prevented the enhancement of UVA photocytotoxicity induced by lovastatin. A protective effect was also observed when cells were supplemented with an amount of low-density lipoprotein giving the same cholesterol concentration in the culture medium. Finally, E64 [L-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)-butane], a lysosomal cathepsin inhibitor, also prevents the cell death induced by UVA in cells treated with lovastatin. These results suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors could increase the sensitivity of skin cells to UVA radiation, and that this phenomenon is related to lysosomal enzyme release.", 
    "39": "Agents that inhibit hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis reduce circulating cholesterol levels in experimental animals and humans, and may be of pharmacological importance in the prevention of atherosclerosis. Azalanstat (RS-21607), a synthetic imidazole, has been shown to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in HepG2 cells, human fibroblasts, hamster hepatocytes and hamster liver, by inhibiting the cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase. When administered orally to hamsters fed regular chow, RS-21607 (50 mg/kg/day) lowered serum cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 = 62 mg/kg) in a period of 1 week. It preferentially lowered low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apo B relative to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apo A-1. It also lowered plasma cholesterol levels in hamsters fed a high saturated fat and cholesterol diet. RS-21607 inhibited hepatic microsomal hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in hamsters in a dose-dependent manner (ED50 = 31 mg/kg), and this was highly correlated with serum cholesterol lowering (r = 0.97). Cholesterol lowering by azalanstat and cholestyramine was additive, and the increase in HMG-CoA reductase brought about by cholestyramine was attenuated significantly by azalanstat. In vitro studies with HepG2 cells indicated that this modulation of reductase activity was indirect, occurring at a post-transcriptional step, and it is proposed that a regulatory oxysterol derived from dihydrolanosterol (or lanosterol) may be responsible for this regulation. Azalanstat does not appear to lower circulating cholesterol in the hamster by up-regulation of the hepatic LDL receptor, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved. Orally administered azalanstat (50-75 mg/kg) stimulated hepatic microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity by 50-400% in hamsters, and it is postulated that this may result from modified cholesterol absorption and bile acid synthesis.", 
    "40": "The action of lovastatin, a competing inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, on bacterial bioluminescence was studied. The lovastatin lactone form and sodium salt of mevinolinic acid inhibited bacterial luciferase in vitro but did not affect bioluminescence of the intact cells of the luminous bacteria. The inhibition was found to be of a competing character in regard to aliphatic aldehyde, the bacterial luciferase substrate. Conditions under which the bioluminescence inhibition was proportional to the lovastatin concentration in the incubation mixture and a bioluminescence method for quantitative determination of the inhibitor were developed.",

The plasma lipid profile (LP) e.g. total cholesterol (TC), fractions and triglycerides (TG) was determined at 4 and 12 weeks of treatment.", 
    "43": "HDL-C was not affected in P, TC and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions were superior to those in G (31.3% vs 13.4% and 38.7 and 11.5%, p < 0.05 and < 0.01 respectively). In G HDL-C raised by 50% (12th week p < 0.01). Gemfibrozil reduced TG levels in 44.7% while in P it varied -32.2% (12th week p < 0.01 and < 0.05 respectively).",

    "45": "Simvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used in the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Since the time simvastatin was previously reviewed in Drugs, a number of large clinical trials have confirmed its clinical efficacy. Thus, reductions from baseline were approximately 20 to 40% for serum levels of total cholesterol, 35 to 45% for low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and 10 to 20% for triglycerides in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia receiving simvastatin 10 to 40 mg/day. High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels were increased modestly by about 5 to 15%. Recent data from long term studies indicate that little or no attenuation of these changes in serum lipid and lipoprotein levels occurred with administration of simvastatin for 3 to 5.4 years. Comparative studies with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin, pravastatin and fluvastatin), which were lacking at the time of the previous review of simvastatin, demonstrated greater reductions in serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol with simvastatin than equal dosages of lovastatin or pravastatin. Reductions in serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were similar between agents only when lovastatin or pravastatin were administered at a total daily dosage twice that of simvastatin and when fluvastatin was administered at a total daily dosage approximately 8 times that of simvastatin. In general, simvastatin 10 to 40 mg/day was also more effective than standard dosages of bile acid sequestrants, fibrates or probucol in lowering serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol; however, fibrates usually produced greater reductions in serum triglycerides and greater elevations in HDL-cholesterol levels. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), a large secondary prevention study in patients with coronary heart disease and concomitant hypercholesterolaemia, demonstrated that simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day for a median of 5.4 years significantly reduced overall mortality (the primary end-point of the study) by 30% compared with placebo, which was attributed to a 42% relative reduction in coronary mortality. Coronary morbidity was also significantly reduced by simvastatin in the 4S trial. The tolerability profile of simvastatin appears to be comparable to that of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The most frequently reported adverse events are gastrointestinal disturbances, which are generally mild and tend to occur less frequently than with cholestyramine. In conclusion, simvastatin is among the most effective agents available for treating patients with hypercholesterolaemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "46": "Biliary excretion of lithocholate-3-sulfate is markedly impaired in EHBR. To examine the mechanism of biliary lithocholate-3-sulfate excretion in EHBR, the effects of colchicine treatment, a vesicular transport inhibitor, and infusion of taurocholate and organic anions were studied in EHBR and Sprague-Dawley rats. Colchicine treatment and taurocholate infusion had no effect of biliary lithocholate-3-sulfate excretion in EHBR, suggesting that biliary lithocholate-3-sulfate excretion is not mediated by the vesicular transport or by the bile acid excretory pathway. In control Sprague-Dawley rats, both sulfobromophthalein and dibromosulfophthalein infusion inhibited biliary lithocholate-3-sulfate excretion. In contrast, in EHBR dibromosulfophthalein infusion inhibited biliary lithocholate-3-sulfate excretion but BSP infusion did not. Indocyanine green and pravastatin infusion did not affect biliary lithocholate-3-sulfate excretion but pravastatin infusion had no effect in EHBR. These findings indicate that, whether physiologically important or not, two of more excretory pathways for organic anions exist at the canalicular membrane other than the ATP-dependent one.", 
    "47": "This study was conducted to define progression of atherosclerosis in both homozygous and heterozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits and to investigate the ability of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin to attenuate progression of the disease. We examined contractile responses to phenylephrine and endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to carbachol in thoracic aorta at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in control New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits, homozygous WHHL rabbits, and heterozygous WHHL rabbits. Homozygous and heterozygous rabbits were treated with simvastatin (10 mg/kg per day) from 3 to 6 months and from 9 to 12 months of age. Simvastatin significantly reduced serum cholesterol levels in young heterozygotes, with a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in older heterozygotes. In homozygotes, no significant fall was observed. Contractile function declined progressively with age in all groups--most in homozygotes and least in NZW rabbits. Relaxation was unaffected by age in NZW rabbits; relaxation declined in the heterozygotes and declined to a greater extent in homozygotes. Simvastatin retarded the loss of function in the young heterozygotes. Similar trends were observed in young homozygotes and older heterozygotes, with no effect in older homozygotes. Histological studies revealed the progressive development of early atherosclerosis in heterozygotes, and more advanced atherosclerosis was observed in homozygotes. Simvastatin did not inhibit development of atheroma. A correlation was observed between vascular function and structure. However, functional changes preceded the development of atheroma. In addition, we have demonstrated that simvastatin can help to reduce the loss of vascular function associated with the progression of atherosclerosis in the heterozygous WHHL rabbit.", 
    "48": "A series of 15-, 32-, and 15,32-substituted lanost-8-en-3 beta-ols is described which function as inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. These agents inhibit lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase activity as well as suppress HMG-CoA reduction activity in cultured cells. Several of these agents are extremely potent as both demethylase inhibitors and reductase suppressors, while others are more selective in their activities. Selected regio double bond isomers show preference for demethylase inhibition with the following order: delta 8 > delta 7 > delta 6 = unsaturated sterols. Comparisons also show that 4,4-dimethyl sterols are always more potent demethylase inhibitors and reductase suppressors than their 4,4-bisnomethyl counterparts. However, evaluation of an extensive oxylanosterol series leads us to conclude that demethylase inhibition and reductase suppression are not parallel in the same molecule. In addition, the oxylanosterols, but not the oxycholesterols, are able to disrupt coordinate regulation of HMG-CoA reductase from the LDL receptor. Thus, oxylanosterol treatment at levels which suppress reductase activity enhances LDL receptor activity. These results demonstrate that compounds can be made which (1) are selective reductase suppressors enabling dissection of the dual inhibitor nature of these compounds and (2) maximize reductase suppression and LDL receptor induction without demethylase inhibition which could lead to novel agents for serum cholesterol lowering.", 
    "49": "We undertook a pilot study examining the efficacy of lovastatin 20 mg every other day in patients with hypercholesterolemia, and found lovastatin to be effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in patients with serum LDL > 160 mg/dl.", 
    "50": "Bioactivity-directed fractionation, using brine shrimp lethality and murine hypoglycemia, of an ethanol extract prepared from Tillandsia usneoides, led to the isolation of four apparently bioactive compounds from the water-soluble fraction. The compounds were identified as citric acid, succinic acid, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG), and 3,6,3',5'-tetramethoxy-5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone-7-O-beta-D-g lucoside. The brine shrimp lethality of the acids was simply due to acidity; however, HMG elicited significant hypoglycemic responses in fasting normal mice. Ethyl and methyl esters of citric acid were prepared and tested in the murine hypoglycemic assay. Five of the predominant sugars were identified by tlc. Free thymidine was also isolated. Further evaluation of HMG and other potential inhibitors of HMG CoA lyase, in the treatment of symptoms of diabetes mellitus, is suggested.", 
    "51": "We studied six patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) before and after 8 weeks of treatment with simvastatin (40 mg day-1), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-Coenzyme A. Simvastatin decreased plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 43% (P = 0.002), triglycerides by 15% [corrected] (P = 0.05) and mevalonic acid (a measure of in vivo cholesterol synthesis) by 20% (P = 0.002); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 17% (P = 0.02). The hepatic secretion rate of very-low-density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B-100 (VLDL apoB) was measured directly using a primed, constant intravenous infusion of 1-[13C]-leucine with monitoring of the isotopic enrichment of apoB by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; fractional secretion rate (FSR) was derived using a monoexponential function. Simvastatin decreased the FSR, ASR and pool size of VLDL apoB by 17% (14.3 (SEM 3.6)) vs. (11.9 (SEM 3.5) pools day-1, P = 0.10), 83% (51.4 (SEM 17.9) vs. (8.6 (SEM 1.4), P = 0.007 mg kg-1 day-1) and 65% (234.2 (SEM 30.4) vs. 82.6 (SEM 24.0) mg, P = 0.02), respectively. The change in the ASR of VLDL apoB was significantly correlated with the change in plasma LDL cholesterol concentration (P = 0.04), but not with the change of triglyceride or mevalonic acid. We conclude that the hepatic secretion of VLDL apoB in FH is decreased by simvastatin, which may partly explain the fall in plasma cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "Drug-drug, drug-food, and drug-disease interactions involving hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are reviewed. The four available HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors-lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin-have different potentials for drug interactions, probably because of their different pharmacokinetic characteristics. Interactions of some of these cholesterol-lowering agents with cyclosporine, erythromycin, high-dose niacin, or gemfibrozil may produce myopathy with or without rhabdomyolysis. Interactions with other commonly prescribed agents, such as bile acid sequestrants, coumarin anticoagulants, and cardiovascular drugs, may alter the pharmacokinetics of either drug, but the clinical significance is generally minor. Food may affect plasma lovastatin concentrations, systemic pravastatin bioavailability, and the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) and time to achieve Cmax for fluvastatin. Hepatic dysfunction may influence the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin; all HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with liver disease or unexplained elevations in serum aminotransferases. Severe renal insufficiency may necessitate dosage modification in lovastatin recipients. Renal dysfunction seems to affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin only minimally, but caution is still warranted. Although the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors rarely have severe adverse effects, they may interact, in some cases dangerously, with other drugs, with food, and with disease states.", 
    "53": "The long-term efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was assessed during a 24-month follow-up period in 168 elderly hypercholesterolemic patients. After completing a 4 week double blind dose ranging study with simvastatin, 47 males and 122 females over 62 years of age with type II hyperlipidemia, a total cholesterol level above 6.5 mmol/l and clinically manifest cardiovascular disease were included in this extended study. A total of 159 patients completed the 12-month follow-up period and 141 patients were monitored over the full 24 months. All patients were started on 10 mg simvastatin once daily and the dosage was increased until the target levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol between 2.3 mmol/l (90 mg/dl) and 3.6 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) were reached. Fifty percent of patients reached the targeted LDL cholesterol goal of < 3.6 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) during the study. At study completion, 65 patients (39%) were taking 40 mg simvastatin per day, 56 patients (33%) 20 mg, 42 patients (25%) 10 mg and 5 patients (3%) only used 5 mg per day. Sixteen patients (9%) received concomitant lipid lowering therapy. Over 2 years, the mean decrease in LDL cholesterol ranged from 36% to 38%, the median decrease in triglycerides was 12% to 19% and the mean increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ranged from 9% to 10%, respectively. Seven patients discontinued simvastatin because of adverse clinical or laboratory events, but only in two (1.1%) was this considered to be drug-related. Side-effects were mild and most frequently gastrointestinal in nature. Mean changes in asparate aminotransferase (AST) were not significantly different from zero and mean changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) showed a small increase. We conclude that simvastatin is an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment for hypercholesterolemia in elderly individuals for extended periods.", 
    "54": "A significant reduction in plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is a recognised consequence of treatment with probucol. By contrast, fibrate therapy in general has the opposite effect. We report two cases where the combination of probucol and a fibrate led to profoundly reduced plasma levels of HDL cholesterol associated with very low levels of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). In the first, bezafibrate was added to probucol, and in the second, probucol added to a combination of simvastatin and fenofibrate. In both cases, plasma levels of HDL and apoA-I returned towards normal after discontinuation of one or both drugs, indicating that the reduction was reversible.", 
    "55": "Macrophages play a critical role in the progression of clinical and experimental glomerular injury. Serum-stimulated human fetal mesangial cells in culture produce a chemotactic factor that is monocyte-selective. This chemotactic factor is most likely monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) as a monoclonal antibody directed against MCP-1, but not an irrelevant antibody, suppressed the mesangial cell-derived chemotactic activity. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase by lovastatin resulted in a reduction of the mesangial cell-derived chemotactic activity as well as MCP-1 mRNA expression. The inhibitory effects of lovastatin in the presence of exogenous cholesterol were reversed by mevalonate, suggesting a role for isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway and/or isoprenylated proteins in mesangial cell MCP-1 regulation. These findings suggest an additional mechanism by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in vivo may reduce glomerular injury.", 
    "56": "It has been reported that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin does not always effectively lower plasma LDL. This drug acts to monocytes/macrophages directly and inhibits cholesterol ester accumulation in these cells. However cytokine production in macrophages when simvastatin was administrated has not been described. In this study, we examined whether simvastatin affects cytokine production in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Simvastatin at doses ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-5) M did not affect the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8) from human peripheral mononuclear cells. In addition, any changes in cytokine-induced cytokine production (IL-1-induced IL-8 synthesis) were not detected after the addition of simvastatin. The present results suggest that simvastatin suppresses foam cell formation in monocyte/macrophage, without affecting the immunological or inflammatory functions of these cells.", 
    "57": "Propionate is a short-chain fatty acid formed in the colon and supposedly involved in the cholesterol-lowering effect of soluble fibre. To explore the underlying mechanism(s) of this fibre action, we have used human hepatocytes in primary culture to study the effects of propionate on hepatic lipid synthesis. Initial experiments with mevalonate and mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.88) were performed to evaluate basic regulatory mechanisms in these cells; results were compared with those obtained with rat hepatocytes. Incubation for 24 h with mevalonate caused a similar, concentration-dependent inhibition of [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol in human and rat hepatocytes. Likewise, mevinolin (100 mumol/l) inhibited the formation of cholesterol from radiolabelled acetate by about 80% in cells from both species. Propionate inhibited cholesterol as well as triacylglycerol synthesis from [14C]acetate with a similar concentration-dependency in rat hepatocytes. Fifty percent inhibition was obtained at a propionate concentration of only 0.1 mmol/l. This propionate-induced inhibition was not affected by a 100-fold excess of unlabelled acetate. Human hepatocytes were much less susceptible in this respect: propionate concentrations of 10-20 mmol/l were required to obtain similar inhibitory effects in these cells, i.e. values greatly exceeding reported portal propionate concentrations in humans. The results suggest the existence of differences in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol (and triacylglycerol) synthesis between human and rat liver cells. These results do not support the hypothesis that the fibre-induced decrease in plasma cholesterol concentration in man is mediated by a direct effect of propionate on hepatic cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "58": "Pravastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, exhibits liver-selectivity in inhibiting sterol synthesis, when administered as a single oral dose to mice or rats, whereas lovastatin and simvastatin do not. This may be due to the fact that pravastatin is distributed intracellularly, to a large extent, in the liver and extracellularly in nonhepatic tissues. In the present study, we examined whether the difference in liver-selectivity among these three HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors observed in single-dose studies was preserved after repeated oral administrations of drugs to mice. De novo sterol synthesis in different tissues of mice was examined in vivo three hours after the last dose of drug by measuring incorporation of intraperitoneally injected [14C]acetate into total sterols. Pravastatin administered orally for 11 consecutive days at 5 and 10 mg/kg exhibited a greater liver-selectivity than lovastatin and simvastatin: sterol synthesis was inhibited more than 60% in the liver by all three drugs, whereas that in nonhepatic tissues was inhibited less than 10% by pravastatin and more than 30% by lovastatin and simvastatinin in most of the nonhepatic tissues examined. Pravastatin administered orally for 11 consecutive days at 10 mg/kg caused more selective inhibition of sterol synthesis in liver ex vivo than two other inhibitors at the same dose. Pravastatin inhibited de novo sterol synthesis from [14C]acetate into sterol fraction in the liver slices in vitro, but minimally in those of the spleen and testis, whereas lovastatin and simvastatin inhibited in those of all three tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "Limonene and related monoterpenes have been shown to impair the incorporation of mevalonic acid-derived isoprene compounds, that is farnesyl pyrophosphate, into RAS and RAS-related proteins. As farnesylation is critical for RAS's membrane localization and function, the isoprenylation pathways have received attention as potential targets of anti-RAS pharmacologic maneuvers. We have expanded on these prior studies and demonstrate that one of limonene's metabolic derivatives, perillyl alcohol, decreases the levels of antigenic RAS in the human-derived myeloid THP-1 and lymphoid RPMI-8402 cell lines. Both limonene and perillyl alcohol decrease levels of [35S]methionine-labeled RAS proteins in cells that have been pulsed with radiolabeled methionine for 4 h. In contrast, lovastatin, which inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and thus depletes cells of farnesyl pyrophosphate, does not diminish levels of total antigenic RAS but rather results in a shift in the RAS protein; levels of farnesylated RAS decrease whereas levels of unmodified/unfarnesylated RAS increase. As limonene and perillyl alcohol do not induce such a shift, we conclude that these monoterpenes decrease farnesylated RAS protein levels by a mechanism that is clearly distinct from that of either depleting cells of farnesyl pyrophosphate or inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl protein transferase that catalyzes the post-translational farnesylation of RAS. Perillyl alcohol decreases antigenic RAS levels but does not decrease levels of another membrane-tethered protein, the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. Furthermore, perillyl alcohol decreases the levels of radiolabeled methionine incorporated into immunoprecipitable RAS to a greater extent than it decreases radiolabeled methionine incorporated into total cellular protein. Thus there is some degree of specificity for the activity of perillyl alcohol to depress RAS levels.", 
    "60": "The main issue is whether briefly stopping treatment of the hypercholesterolemic patient will accelerate the atherosclerotic process. This is possible, but such a strategy is preferable only in a subgroup of patients who cannot bear the economic burden of increasing the dosage of statins. In addition, stopping and restarting the drug at different stages lessens the likelihood of more adverse effects occurring when the dosage is increased.", 
    "61": "Our study indicates that the combination of nicotinic acid (1.2 g/day) and lovastatin (20 mg/day) is more effective than either drug alone in reducing total and LDL cholesterol. Although HDL cholesterol was not significantly improved by these doses of agents over the duration of this study, LDL/HDL and HDL/total cholesterol ratios were improved due to the beneficial actions on total and LDL cholesterol. No serious side effects or changes in serum chemistries were observed, and the combination was well tolerated.", 
    "62": "Renal insufficiency is frequently associated with both quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in lipid and hemorheologic profiles. Although this may lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, a number of studies have also shown dyslipidemia to be a significant risk factor for the progression of renal insufficiency in human chronic renal disease. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed to assess the effect of fluvastatin, a synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on these parameters in dyslipidemic patients with or without chronic renal insufficiency. After a 6-week placebo run-in, 42 patients who had been previously stratified into 2 groups on the basis of creatinine clearance levels (0.5-1.0 mL/sec or > 1.0-1.5 mL/sec) were randomized to treatment with fluvastatin (40 mg daily) or matching placebo. Significant differences (on analysis of variance with repeated measures) were seen between fluvastatin and placebo treatment groups for changes in total cholesterol (-15% vs 1%, respectively; p < 0.001), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; -21% vs -5%; p < 0.001), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (-14% vs 14%; p = 0.017), very low density lipoprotein triglycerides (-1% vs 29%; p = 0.014) and total triglycerides (-7% vs 24%; p < 0.001). These effects on cholesterol levels were reflected in a significant decrease in apolipoprotein B levels with fluvastatin therapy (p < 0.001). Apolipoprotein A-I levels increased (p = 0.054) despite no significant change in the levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Response to therapy did not differ between the 2 renal function groups for any of the lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein variables. Hemorheologic parameters were not altered with fluvastatin therapy, regardless of renal function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "Alcohol consumption is known to have beneficial effects on cardiac mortality, probably by increasing high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Alcohol also increases triglycerides and, in some studies, total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Nothing is known, however, of the effects of alcohol on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. Consequently, 2 studies have been carried out to determine the effects of alcohol consumption on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin. Firstly, the effects of acute alcohol consumption on a single, oral 40 mg dose of fluvastatin were examined in a reference-controlled, randomized, crossover study in 10 healthy volunteers. Measurements were made after ingestion of 70 g of ethanol diluted to 20% with lemonade and, following a 7-day period, after ingestion of lemonade alone (reference). The half-life (t1/2) of a single dose of fluvastatin was significantly reduced by acute alcohol consumption compared with reference, whereas the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), and time to peak concentration (tmax) did not differ from the reference group. The lipid profile, measured 8 hr after administration, did not differ significantly from baseline in the reference group, apart from a slight reduction in apolipoprotein (apo)-AI. Triglyceride levels increased with alcohol, probably due to impaired fatty acid oxidation.

Reduction of plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to the normal range may prevent premature atherosclerosis and usually requires a combination of cholesterol-lowering drugs such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors plus resins or fibrates. The current, 60-week, open-label investigation involved 22 patients whose plasma LDL-C had not reached the target level for prevention of coronary artery disease in 3 previous studies using fluvastatin alone and in combination with other cholesterol-lowering medications. At the beginning of the current study, patients were stabilized on fluvastatin monotherapy at 40 mg/day. After 6 weeks, the daily treatment changed to a combination of fluvastatin 40 mg/day in the evening and bezafibrate 400 mg/day in the morning. After a further 6 weeks, a lunchtime dose of cholestyramine 8 g/day was added, to form triple cholesterol-lowering therapy. Efficacy was determined by plasma lipid/lipoprotein analysis. Baseline levels were assessed after 4 weeks of placebo treatment, prior to active treatment, in the first fluvastatin study. Safety analyses included liver and renal function tests, creatine phosphokinase levels and blood counts. Compliance was determined by counting the fluvastatin capsules, bezafibrate tablets, and cholestyramine sachets returned by the patients at each visit. The triple-drug combination used in this study was more effective than the double therapy and resulted in stabilization of the LDL-C:high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio, at a reduction from baseline ranging from -40.4 to -52.5%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Combinations of fibrates and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are effective, but because of safety concerns related to myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, it is important to consider the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions when such combinations are used. In this study, the area under the curve, maximum plasma concentration, and time to maximum concentration for fluvastatin and gemfibrozil are compared, when used alone and in combination, in patients with hyperlipidemia and either coronary or carotid atherosclerosis, or a family history of coronary artery disease. A total of 17 patients were studied in a random sequence, open-label, crossover study of fluvastatin at 20 mg twice daily, gemfibrozil at 600 mg twice daily, and the combination of the 2 drugs. No significant difference was observed in area under the curve, maximum plasma concentration, and time to maximum concentration when comparing the combination with each drug alone. These pharmacokinetic data add support to the clinical observations that the combination of fluvastatin and gemfibrozil is both effective and safe.",

In such familial hypercholesterolemic patients, the lipid-lowering efficacy of fluvastatin is related to genetic factors, and it is of interest whether the response to treatment differs from that in patients with more moderate hypercholesterolemia. Thus an exploratory analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials and their open-label extensions (12-78 weeks), conducted worldwide with fluvastatin > or = 20 mg/day (n = 1810) and placebo (n = 783), assessed whether, apart from the potential differences between familial hypercholesterolemic and nonfamilial hypercholesterolemic patients, the response to 40 mg of fluvastatin is influenced by baseline plasma lipid levels in relation to disease severity.

Fluvastatin is the first completely synthetic agent in this class and offers a considerable price advantage over the other HMG-CoA therapies. In May 1994, the Buffalo Veterans Affairs Medical Center Lipid Clinic adopted a fluvastatin-preferred program in which all patients who were recommended for an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor would be treated with fluvastatin as a first-line agent. Fluvastatin was started at 20 mg daily and titrated to goal. Patients who were stable with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were converted to fluvastatin as just described. Preliminary analysis shows that, for new patients, 20 mg of fluvastatin daily at bedtime reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by an average of 22% (range, 5-32%). Preliminary results for patients converted from another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor showed that fluvastatin produced an additional LDL-C reduction of 18% (range, 5-30%). With a daily dose of 20 mg fluvastatin, patients with no heart disease (primary prevention) achieved ATP II goals in 60% of cases. For patients with established heart disease (secondary prevention), the goals of ATP II are lower but, despite this, 30% of patients taking fluvastatin at 20 mg daily achieved these goals.

Studies in vitro have indicated that the new, entirely synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor fluvastatin affects the metabolism of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac and the oral hypoglycemic tolbutamide. Diclofenac and tolbutamide are both model substrates of the CYP2C isozymes, suggesting that this enzyme could be involved in the underlying mechanism of interaction. The concomitant use of lipid-lowering drugs with oral hypoglycemic agents has been recommended in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Therefore, 2 studies were initiated to explore potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between fluvastatin, simvastatin, or placebo and the oral hypoglycemic agents tolbutamide (study I) and glyburide (study II), each in 16 healthy subjects. These compounds were selected because of a demonstrated in vitro interaction with tolbutamide and widespread clinical use of glyburide. A further study (study III) was conducted to investigate the potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between fluvastatin and glyburide under therapeutic conditions in 32 patients with NIDDM. Single and multiple coadministration of fluvastatin 40 mg or simvastatin 20 mg increased the mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time curve of glyburide by about 20%. The pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide were influenced to only a minor extent. Fluvastatin concentration-time profiles were unaffected by tolbutamide or glyburide coadministration.

    "78": "Atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial process resulting from an excessive inflammatory/fibroproliferative response to various forms of injurious stimuli to the arterial wall. The potential interactions of cells, cytokines, and growth-regulatory molecules among the different cells in the atherosclerotic lesion present numerous opportunities for modulating lesion formation and progression. Smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration and proliferation, together with lipid deposition, are now recognized as the major phenomena occurring within the arterial wall, and thus these phenomena serve as targets for pharmacologic intervention in the process of atherogenesis. Migration and proliferation of SMC are key events in atherosclerosis--and in restenosis after angioplasty. An understanding of the factors that induce such events is important for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Mevalonate and other intermediates of cholesterol synthesis (isoprenoids) are essential for cell proliferation; hence drugs affecting this metabolic pathway are potential antiatherosclerotic agents. Recently, this group provided in vitro and in vivo evidence of decreases in SMC proliferation by fluvastatin and simvastatin, but not pravastatin, independent of their cholesterol-lowering properties. The in vitro inhibition of cell migration and proliferation induced by simvastatin and fluvastatin (70-90% decrease) was completely prevented by the addition of mevalonate, and partially prevented (70-80%) by farnesol or geranylgeraniol. This confirms the specific role of isoprenoid metabolites--most probably geranylgerylated protein(s)--in regulating cell migration and proliferation. The inhibitory effect of fluvastatin and simvastatin on cholesterol esterification induced by acetyl low density lipoprotein in macrophages was also prevented by the addition of geranylgeraniol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In contrast, chronic lipid-lowering therapy is effective in restoring endothelial function of the coronary and peripheral circulation in patients with hypercholesterolemia. A beneficial effect was already documented after 3 months of therapy with fluvastatin but full restoration may last more than 1 year.", 
    "84": "The effects of fluvastatin, a new fully synthetic inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on growth and cell-cycle kinetics of porcine and human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) were studied by growth curves and flow cytometric determination of cell-cycle distribution. Growth curves were obtained from counting after 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, and 14 days of incubation in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). For cell-cycle phase determination, cells were synchronized in G0 by 48 hours of incubation in serum-free medium, then stimulated by incubation in 10% FCS, with or without fluvastatin. There was a concentration-dependent decrease in the proliferation of human and porcine SMC when cells were incubated in the presence of fluvastatin. The reduction in the number of cells was significant with 10(-5) M and 10(-4) M fluvastatin. The G/S-phase transition of human and porcine vascular SMC was reduced to 50% of controls by 10(-4) M fluvastatin, as revealed by cell-cycle analysis. The effects of fluvastatin on growth kinetics and cell-cycle distribution could be completely reversed by the addition of 1 mM mevalonolactone, indicating that the fluvastatin effects are due to specific inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. The addition of low density lipoprotein as a source of cholesterol failed to support SMC growth and phase transition. Addition of squalene or cholesterol to the culture medium also failed to normalize cell growth. It is concluded that nonsterol products synthesized from mevalonate are necessary for the growth of SMC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have rapidly become widespread in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and are known to be variable in efficacy. To investigate the effect on biliary lipids, a 3-month study using fluvastatin was devised. A total of 19 patients were enrolled in this study: all had hypercholesterolemia (7 men, 12 women; 13 with type IIa, 6 with type IIb). After an observation period of 4-6 weeks with placebo, fluvastatin at a daily dose of 30 mg was administered for 3 months. Fasting blood samples were taken early in the morning, before, and once a month during 3 months of fluvastatin treatment, for measurement of serum lipids. Cerulein-stimulated bile in the gallbladder was sampled using a duodenal tube, and the changes in biliary lipids were assessed. There was a marked decrease in serum total cholesterol after 12 weeks of treatment (21%; p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the bile cholesterol saturation index (CSI): values before and after 3 months of drug administration were 0.93 and 0.99, respectively (Admirand-Small method). There were no significant changes in either the fatty acid composition of biliary lecithin or in the bile acid composition of bile. In conclusion, on the basis of these results, short-term (3 months) administration of fluvastatin does not appear to affect CSI.", 
    "86": "Hypercholesterolemia is common following renal transplantation and undoubtedly contributes to morbidity and mortality due to occlusive atherosclerosis in these patients. Although 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are more tolerable as low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering agents than other classes of drugs, their use in transplant patients has been limited due to potentially serious interactions with cyclosporine. Fluvastatin is the first wholly synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Because it has a shorter half-life and greater protein-binding capacity than other drugs of this class and has no active circulating metabolites, fluvastatin may be safer than other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in this group of patients. To study this question, 19 renal transplant recipients (age, 21-70 years) with hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C > 180 mg/dL; triglycerides < 400 mg/liter) were entered into a 14-week active-treatment period with fluvastatin at 20 mg/day following dietary stabilization and a 3-week placebo washout period. Changes in LDL-C levels were compared with those obtained in control hypercholesterolemic subjects treated in the same way. The lipid-lowering ability of fluvastatin was not imparied in these patients, indicating a lack of interaction with cyclosporine. Mean liver enzyme levels, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and creatine did not change significantly from baseline. Two subjects experienced myalgias without CPK elevations, and another subject experienced an asymptomatic increase in CPK to > 10 times the upper limit of normal, related to exercise. In conclusion, fluvastatin safely and effectively lowers elevated LDL-C levels in renal transplant recipients.", 
    "87": "The lipophilic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been associated with rhabdomyolysis in cyclosporine-treated treated patients, indicating an interaction of drugs. We therefore studied the safety and efficacy of the hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin in 14 cyclosporine-treated renal transplant patients. To qualify for inclusion, total cholesterol after dietary stabilization had to be > 240 mg/dL. Prior to starting active medication, patients underwent a 4-week placebo period. Fluvastatin was given in a dose of 20 mg once daily for 12 weeks, which was increased to 20 mg twice daily for a further 8 weeks. Fluvastatin reduced total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in all patients at both dosages whereas no effect on high density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed. Triglyceride levels were lowered at week 20. Incremental dosages of fluvastatin did not affect cyclosporine concentration and no adjustment of cyclosporine dosage was necessary. The higher doses of fluvastatin also had no effect on renal function as judged by serum creatinine levels. Creatine phosphokinase remained unchanged throughout the study. No serious side-effects were observed. In conclusion, the hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin at either 20 or 40 mg/day appears to be both safe and effective in lowering atherogenic lipids in renal transplant patients.", 
    "88": "We describe two patients treated with a combination of cyclosporin and simvastatin who had to be hospitalized due to rhabdomyolysis. As suggested by reduced cyclosporin clearance, both patients had impaired activity of the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system, which may have contributed to the development of rhabdomyolysis. After cessation of treatment with simvastatin and intensive hydration, both patients recovered within one week. While rhabdomyolysis has been described in several patients receiving the combination lovastatin/cyclosporin, so far only one case has been reported in patients treated with simvastatin/cyclosporin. Our cases therefore suggest that this complication may be more frequent than previously suspected. In patients treated with cyclosporin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be used cautiously, and concomitant administration of drugs inhibiting the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system should be avoided.", 
    "89": "Fluvastatin (FV), a new cholesterol-lowering agent, has been studied for its effects on hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes in male rats. FV was orally administered in dosages of 1, 5, and 30 mg/kg/day for 7 consecutive days. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activities were markedly decreased at all dose levels. The amount of microsomal protein and the contents of cytochromes P450 and b5 did not change. No induction of aniline hydroxylase, aminopyrine N-demethylase, testosterone hydroxylases (15 alpha-, 7 alpha-, 6 beta-, 16 alpha-, and 16 beta-), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were found. On the other hand, 7-ethoxycoumarin o-deethylase activity was slightly increased and lauric acid omega-1-hydroxylase activity tended to be decreased after treatment with FV.", 
    "90": "The growth of the culture-adapted procyclic forms of Trypanosoma brucei (procyclics) is accelerated by supplementation of the medium with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. This effect can be attributed to receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL, followed by utilization of lipids carried by the lipoproteins. Indeed, procyclics that normally contain ergosterol synthesized de novo, also incorporate exogenous cholesterol in their membranes. In turn, import of exogenous lipids down-regulates the isoprenoid biosynthetic machinery as measured by a approx. 3-fold decrease of [14C]acetate incorporation into sterols and a approx. 2-fold decrease of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity, compared with cells grown in lipoprotein-depleted medium. Synvinolin, a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase that slows down the procyclic growth in vitro and decreases [14C]acetate incorporation into sterols, produces striking morphological modifications, including an arrest at cytokinesis and an extensive swelling of the kinetoplast-mitochondrion system. These cytotoxic effects are amplified in the absence of lipoprotein supply. In conclusion, procyclics may acquire sterols from both exogenous and endogenous sources. To a large extent, these two pathways compensate each other, illustrating adaptation of the parasites to survive in extremely different environments.",

On a milligram-per-milligram basis, simvastatin is twice as potent as lovastatin and pravastatin. The hypocholesterolemic effects of fluvastatin appear to be approximately 30% less than that of lovastatin. In posttransplant patients receiving cyclosporine, safety has been documented for low doses of lovastatin and simvastatin, but when a higher dosage of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is warranted, pravastatin should be considered the drug of choice because of a lower incidence of myopathy. Relevant data on the incidence of adverse effects are presented. Pertinent outcomes data from clinical trials evaluating the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on atherosclerosis regression and coronary mortality, as well as published economic analyses of cholesterol-lowering agents, are summarized.

    "105": "In order to investigate the anti-proliferative effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase inhibitor, we evaluated the effects of lovastatin on DNA replication and the proliferation of rat mesangial and aortic smooth muscle cells, both of which were mesenchymal origin cells. Proliferations were determined by measuring [3H]thymidine uptake, and counting the number of cells. Growth-arrested mesangial and aortic smooth muscle cells were exposed to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), endothelin (ET) and angiotensin II (Ang II) to stimulate mitogenesis. All agents exhibited dose-dependent stimulation of [3H] thymidine uptake. PDGF was more potent than the others. Ang II increased [3H] thymidine uptake without demonstrable mitogenic activity. Lovastatin inhibited PDGF (10 ng/ml in mesangial cell, 25 ng/ml in smooth muscle cell)-, ET (10(-7)M)- and Ang II (10(-7)M)-induced [3H] thymidine uptake significantly in a dose-dependent manner in both cells. The increase of cell number in response to PDGF and ET treatment were also inhibited at 10 microM of lovastatin. The inhibitory effect of lovastatin was largely overcome in the presence of exogenous mevalonate at 200 microM, with 75.5% restoration from lovastatin-induced inhibition on PDGF-induced [3H] thymidine uptake in mesangial cells (77.8% in aortic smooth muscle cells). However, the addition of cholesterol did not prevent inhibition by lovastatin. In conclusion, lovastatin had an inhibitory effect on mesangial and aortic smooth muscle cell proliferation, and mevalonate was essential for DNA replication in both types of cells. Lovastatin may reduce glomerular and atherosclerotic injury through an anti-proliferative effect on mesangial and vascular smooth muscle cells, in addition to lowering circulating lipids.", 
    "106": "In this study the mechanism by which manganese (Mn) induces learning defect and its reversibility has been investigated in rats. Female albino rats were dosed orally with 357 micrograms Mn/kg body weight for 15 or 30 days. Attempts were made to correct the Mn-induced learning defect by (1) co-administration of mevinolin and Mn for 30 days; (2) administration of mevinolin for 15 days after 15 days of dosing with Mn, and (3) by withdrawal of Mn treatment (15 days dosing with Mn followed by 15 days without Mn). Mevinolin was given orally at 235.7 micrograms/kg body weight. Significant increases in the Mn and cholesterol levels in the hippocampus were accompanied by an obvious slowness in learning of rats exposed to Mn. After one training period (day 29) the time required to reach the exit of a T-maze was 104.5 +/- 13.8 sec for rats dosed with Mn for 30 days, whereas that of the controls was 28.7 +/- 11.4 sec on day 30. This delay was completely corrected (to 30.7 +/- 6.0 sec) in rats co-administered mevinolin (an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis) with Mn. Withdrawal of Mn, with or without inhibiting the cholesterol biosynthesis, also corrected the Mn-induced learning defect. These results suggest that Mn toxicity produces learning disability by increasing cholesterol biosynthesis and this reversible disability in learning can be corrected by withdrawal of Mn exposure.", 
    "107": "Previous data in rat conductance vessels indicated that cellular mevalonate contributes to vascular tone and systemic blood pressure control. Using exogenous mevalonate (M) or lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (L), we characterized the role of mevalonate availability in resistance artery function, both in experimental animals and humans. Rat mesenteric artery resistance vessels (MARV, n = 9) were incubated for 48 h with either L, M, L + M, or vehicle (V) and tested for reactivity to NE, serotonin, acetylcholine, atrial natriuretic peptide, and sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Lovastatin increased sensitivity to NE (P < 0.03) and serotonin (P < 0.003), and significantly impaired the response to all three vasodilators. These effects were reversed by co-incubation with mevalonate. Mevalonate alone had no effect. In separate experiments, intravascular free Ca2+ concentration (ivfCa2+) was determined in fura-2AM loaded MARV. Basal ivfCa2+ was increased after a 48-h exposure to L (52.7 +/- 4.6 nM, L, vs. 29.7 +/- 2.4 nM, V, n = 12, P < 0.003), as were ivfCa2+ levels following stimulation with low (100 nM) NE concentrations. Similar ivfCa2+ concentrations were achieved during maximum contraction with NE (10 mM) in both groups. Human resistance arteries of human adipose tissue were also studied. Lovastatin increased the sensitivity to NE (ED50 = 372 +/- 56 nM, V, and 99 +/- 33 nM, L, P < 0.001) and significantly decreased the relaxation to acetylcholine and SNP of human vessels. We conclude that mevalonate availability directly contribute to resistance vessel function and vascular signal transduction systems in both experimental animals and humans. The study calls for the identification of non-sterol, mevalonate-derived vasoactive metabolites, and suggests that disorders of the mevalonate pathway can alter vascular tone and cause hypertension."
