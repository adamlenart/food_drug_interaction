However, for a better interpretation of the experimental data as well as to possibly predict cholesterol levels given a certain dosing regimen of statins and phytosterols/-stanols a more theoretically based approach is helpful. This study aims to construct a mathematical model to simulate reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in persons who combine the use of statins with a high intake of phytosterols/-stanols, e.g. by the use of functional foods.", 
    "11": "The proposed model includes the cholesterol pool size in the liver and serum levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. Both an additional and a multiplicative effect of phytosterol/-stanol intake on LDL cholesterol reduction were predicted from the model. The additional effect relates to the decrease of dietary cholesterol uptake reduction, the multiplicative effect relates to the decrease in enterohepatic recycling efficiency, causing increased cholesterol elimination through bile. From the model, it was demonstrated that a daily intake of 2 g phytosterols/-stanols reduces LDL cholesterol level by about 8% to 9% on top of the reduction resulting from statin use. The additional decrease in LDL cholesterol caused by phytosterol/-stanol use at the recommended level of 2 g/d appeared to be similar or even greater than the decrease achieved by doubling the statin dose.",

We interviewed 30 healthy UK patients at high risk of heart disease, recruited from a family history trial at 2 weeks and 6 months after a discussion with a clinician about their risk, lifestyle and medications. The participants took four different paths: (i) pharmaceutical (most common, risk reduction with cholesterol lowering statins), (ii) mixed (statins and behaviour change), (iii) behavioural (behaviour change, focus on wellbeing) and (iv) 'lost' (no prevention, difficult social/personal circumstances). Drawing on Berg we argue that coronary heart disease (CHD) risk assessment technologies are formal tools that generate, rather than represent, high risk in a way that patients often experience lifestyle change as futile, because it rarely reduces their cholesterol to targets defined by the tools. We suggest social scientists studying incipient or 'proto-diseases', such as CHD risk, should not only focus on understandings but also investigate the technologies (and the associated guidelines, policies, clinical practice and pharmaceutical industry operations) that generate incipient diseases and patients' experiences of them. However, technologies do not determine experience and we also discuss elements that direct patients down other than the pharmaceutical path.", 
    "14": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia is a disorder of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol metabolism, which is associated with the onset of vascular changes associated with coronary heart disease in childhood. This disorder has co-dominant transmission with a prevalence of one in 500 in the general population. Cascade screening is the most effective method of identifying children. Children in the at-risk group should have their cholesterol levels checked between the age of 2 and 10 years. Children with LDL cholesterol levels \u2265 3.4 mmol/L are likely to suffer from this disorder, although at this level there is a significant false positive rate. Molecular genetic testing is available for the LDL receptor gene, APOB gene and the PCSK9 gene. This is the most specific test for familial hypercholesterolaemia but has a false negative rate of 20-50%. Once diagnosed, treatment should be considered in children with an LDL cholesterol level \u2265 4.9 mmol/L. If the child has two other risk factors or a positive family history, this threshold should be lowered to \u22654.1 mmol/L. Guidelines recommend that treatment should be commenced by the age of 10 years, although some advise waiting until menarche in females. Statin therapy is currently recommended as first line treatment. Randomised placebo trials have shown that statin therapy reduces LDL cholesterol levels by 25% and is not associated with increased risk of adverse events. These are short-term studies, and longer follow-up will be required to definitively prove efficacy and safety.",

The basic idea is using an observational study to emulate a hypothetical randomised trial by comparing initiators versus non-initiators of treatment. After adjustment for measured baseline confounders, one can then conduct the observational analogue of an intention-to-treat analysis. We also explain two approaches to conduct the analogues of per-protocol and as-treated analyses after further adjusting for measured time-varying confounding and selection bias using inverse-probability weighting. As an example, we implemented these methods to estimate the effect of statins for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from electronic medical records in the UK. Despite strong confounding by indication, our approach detected a potential benefit of statin therapy. The analogue of the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (HR) of CHD was 0.89 (0.73, 1.09) for statin initiators versus non-initiators. The HR of CHD was 0.84 (0.54, 1.30) in the per-protocol analysis and 0.79 (0.41, 1.41) in the as-treated analysis for 2 years of use versus no use. In contrast, a conventional comparison of current users versus never users of statin therapy resulted in a HR of 1.31 (1.04, 1.66).

Expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is an adverse prognostic indicator in various human tumor cells and contributes significantly to their metastatic potential. Statin therapy reduces circulating ICAM-1 levels in patients with coronary heart disease and is associated with reduction in progression from Barrett esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma.

    "40": "Human V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells monitor isoprenoid metabolism by recognizing (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP), an intermediate in the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway used by microbes, and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), an intermediate in the mevalonate pathway used by humans. Aminobisphosphonates and alkylamines indirectly stimulate V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells by inhibiting farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) in the mevalonate pathway, thereby increasing IPP/triphosphoric acid 1-adenosin-5'-yl ester 3-(3-methylbut-3-enyl) ester that directly stimulate. In this study, we further characterize stimulation by these compounds and define pathways used by new classes of compounds. Consistent with FDPS inhibition, stimulation of V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells by aminobisphosphonates and alkylamines was much more sensitive to statin inhibition than stimulation by prenyl pyrophosphates; however, the continuous presence of aminobisphosphonates was toxic for T cells and blocked their proliferation. Aminobisphosphonate stimulation was rapid and prolonged, independent of known Ag-presenting molecules, and resistant to fixation. New classes of stimulatory compounds-mevalonate, the alcohol of HMBPP, and alkenyl phosphonates-likely stimulate differently. Mevalonate, a rate-limiting metabolite, appears to enter cells to increase IPP levels, whereas the alcohol of HMBPP and alkenyl phosphonates are directly recognized. The critical chemical feature of bisphosphonates is the amino moiety, because its loss switched aminobisphosphonates to direct Ags. Transfection of APCs with small interfering RNA downregulating FDPS rendered them stimulatory for V\u03b32V\u03b42 cells and increased cellular IPP. Small interfering RNAs for isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase functioned similarly. Our results show that a variety of manipulations affecting isoprenoid metabolism lead to stimulation of V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells and that pulsing aminobisphosphonates would be more effective for the ex vivo expansion of V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells for adoptive cancer immunotherapy.", 
    "41": "Apoptosis of osteoblasts has been proposed as the common basis of osteoporosis, with oxidative stress as the major cause. This study was performed to investigate the protective effect of simvastatin (0.001-0.1 \u00b5M) on 100 \u00b5M hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in human osteosarcoma (MG63) cells and the molecular mechanisms involved. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by observation of morphological changes and Annexin V-propidium iodide double staining followed by flow cytometric analysis. MTS assays were used to evaluate cell viability. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, the expression of caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bcl-2 were analyzed by Western blotting. Following stimulation with H2O2 for 24 h, a high proportion of MG63 cells underwent apoptosis, while a dose-dependent inhibition of apoptosis was observed in the presence of simvastatin. A significant, dose-dependent reduction in the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-9 protein induced by H2O2 in MG63 cells was observed in response to simvastatin and the Bcl-2 levels were increased. In conclusion, simvastatin protects MG63 cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through downregulation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation and upregulation of Bcl-2 expression, suggesting a protective effect in osteoporosis.",

Fructose overload was induced by supplementing the drinking water with fructose (100 mg/L, 18 wks). Simvastatin treatment (5 mg/kg/day for 2 wks) was performed by gavage. The arterial pressure was recorded using a data acquisition system. Autonomic control was evaluated by pharmacological blockade.",

Fructose + simvastatin rats exhibited increased insulin sensitivity (5.4 \u00b1 0.66%/min). The fructose and fructose + simvastatin groups demonstrated an increase in the mean arterial pressure compared with controls rats (fructose: 124 \u00b1 2 mmHg and fructose+simvastatin: 126 \u00b1 3 mmHg vs. controls: 112 \u00b1 2 mmHg). The sympathetic effect was enhanced in the fructose group (73 \u00b1 7 bpm) compared with that in the control (48 \u00b1 7 bpm) and fructose+simvastatin groups (31 \u00b1 8 bpm). The vagal effect was increased in fructose + simvastatin animals (84 \u00b1 7 bpm) compared with that in control (49 \u00b1 9 bpm) and fructose animals (46 \u00b1 5 bpm).",

In addition, time-kill curves of methanol alone, simvastatin 100% and simvastatin 5% were performed for S. aureus ATCC 29213.", 
    "48": "Relevant antimicrobial activity was observed only for simvastatin 100% when tested against S. aureus (MIC = 31 mg/l). MIC of simvastatin 5% was more than 10-fold higher (500 mg/l). In analogy, time-kill rates of simvastatin against S. aureus decreased markedly when the methanol content in the test solutions was reduced. In both experimental settings, antimicrobial activity observed for pure methanol was only slightly inferior to that of simvastatin 100%.", 
    "49": "Previously published results about the antimicrobial effect of statins relied on the use of pure methanol as solvent. Present data indicate that the observed antimicrobial effect must be attributed, at least to a very large extent, to the solvent. Toxicity of solvents may influence microbiological evaluation of poorly water-soluble substances. pH adjustment to enhance solubility and thus reduce the need for using organic solvent might sometimes overcome this problem.",

In this study, we aimed to establish the significance of visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure for renal function. We analyzed 143 consecutive patients undergoing renal Doppler ultrasonography in our hospital ward and measured blood pressure at outpatient visits six or more times. We analyzed the correlation between visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure and multiple clinical parameters, including albuminuria and resistive index evaluated by renal Doppler ultrasonography, which is thought to be a good indicator of renal vascular resistance. Subjects with higher variability in systolic blood pressure showed a significantly higher prevalence rate of clinical albuminuria and microalbuminuria, and showed significantly higher resistive index. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that variability in systolic blood pressure was a significant risk factor for higher resistive index, independent of other renal risk factors. Visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure correlates significantly with renal function and renal arteriosclerotic change. This parameter could provide additional information about renal arteriosclerotic change independent of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria, and should be considered a therapeutic target for renal protection.",

Patients were randomized to group A (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] target < 100 mg/dL) and group B (< 130 mg/dL). The incidence of NOD during the 42-month follow-up was very low, 0.83 to 1.00/100 patient-years in patients with MetS and MetS with impaired fasting glucose, respectively. Older age, increased waist circumference, and persistent MetS were determinants of NOD. One CVD nonfatal event occurred in the 28 patients with NOD. Our findings suggest that treating the characteristics of MetS is achievable and beneficial. New-onset diabetes incidence and CVD events were negligible and not different from what is expected in the general population.",

We measured total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride and from these calculated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL-C. We determined the average measured apoB values, at critical target values of LDL-C and non-HDL-C, by linear regression and compared them with values of apoB considered equivalent to these cholesterol indexes by expert groups. We also assessed the number of patients, both before and after treatment, in whom c-LDL-C and non-HDL-C could not be calculated due to hypertriglyceridaemia.",

The difference was most marked for c-LDL-C in hypertriglyceridaemic subjects and for non-HDL-C in patients without hypertriglyceridaemia. A similar pattern was seen using centile-derived consensus values but the differences were accentuated because this approach generates lower equivalent consensus apoB values.",

We have studied the potential developmental toxicity effects of PPD10558 in pregnant rats and rabbits given daily oral doses during the period of organogenesis. Rats were dosed with 0, 20, 80, or 320 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day (GD) 6 to 17 and rabbits received dose levels of 0, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day from GD 6 to 18. Additional groups in both studies served as toxicokinetic animals and received the PPD10558 in the same manner as the main study groups at the same dose levels. Blood samples were collected from toxicokinetic animals at designated time points on GD 6 and 17 in rats and GD 6 and 18 in rabbits. Fetal exposure in rats was assessed on GD 20. Maternal and developmental parameters were evaluated in rats and rabbits on GD 20 and GD 29, respectively. No maternal and developmental toxicity was observed at any of the dose levels used in the rat study. Evidence of fetal exposure was determined in fetal plasma with mean fetal concentrations of PPD10558 and the metabolite (PPD11901) found to be between 1 and 6% of the mean maternal concentrations. In rabbits, marked maternal toxicity including mortality (eight deaths; 1 dose at 25 and 7 at 50 mg/kg/day), abortions (2 at 25 mg/kg/day and 6 at 50 mg/kg/day) and reduction in gestation body weight, gestation body weight changes and decreased food consumption were observed. In addition, fetal body weights of the combined sexes were significantly reduced at 50 mg/kg/day in comparison with the controls. Mean peak exposure (Cmax) and total exposure (AUC(0-24)) of PPD11901 in both rats and rabbits were higher than that of PPD10558 on GD 6 and GD 17 at each of the three dose levels.. Based on the results of these studies, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and developmental toxicity in rats was considered to be \u2265 320 mg/kg/day, the highest dose level used in the study.

Atorvastatin showed significant effects in reducing the brain water content, blocking neuron apoptosis, and decreasing plasma MMP-9 in rats with ICH.

To calculate improvements in long-term outcomes, we applied previous estimates of the change in heart disease deaths between 1980 and 2000 that was attributable to statin treatment and to the reduction in total cholesterol during the period. Experts estimated the share of cholesterol reduction that could be attributed to lipid standardization. We applied alternative assumptions about the value of a life-year saved to estimate the value of life-years saved attributable to the programs.",

With more conservative assumptions (0.5% of cholesterol-related benefits attributable to the programs and a $50,000 value per life-year), the benefit attributable to the programs was $338 million. In 2007, the CDC lipid standardization programs cost $1.7 million.",

Their possible use has only relatively recently been studied and data in the literature are sometimes controversial or are not disclosed. The aim of this paper is to review the recent literature and to discuss possible reasons for using statins in patients with extracoronary atherosclerotic arterial involvement, focusing on the areas in which they have been investigated. The main conclusions are that statins should be prescribed with the objective of reducing coronary and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with carotid disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and lower limb occlusive disease. There is sufficient evidence to suggest a reduction in the perioperative risk of vascular surgery when statins are used, and in patients with carotid stenosis they also appear to reduce perioperative risk in endarterectomy. Nevertheless, there are insufficient data to recommend the use of statins to control post-endarterectomy restenosis. In patients with intermittent claudication, statins improve walking distance and may be used for this purpose. Finally, there is insufficient evidence to recommend statins to prevent restenosis in lower limb revascularization procedures, to control progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms, or to reduce the severity of renal artery stenosis or renal dysfunction.",

It not only transforms biliverdin-IX alpha into the antioxidant bilirubin-IX alpha but through its serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity is able to modulate cell signaling networks. BVR-A's involvement in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment was previously described. Statins have been proposed to reduce risk of AD. In this study we evaluated the effect of atorvastatin treatment (80 mg/day for 14.5 months) on BVR-A in the parietal cortex, cerebellum and liver of a well characterized pre-clinical model of AD, the aged beagle. We found that atorvastatin significantly increased BVR-A protein levels, phosphorylation and activity only in parietal cortex. Additionally, we found significant negative correlations between BVR-A and oxidative stress indices, as well as discrimination learning error scores. Furthermore, BVR-A up-regulation and post-translational modifications significantly correlated with \u03b2-secretase protein levels in the brain, suggesting a possible role for BVR-A in A\u03b2 formation.",

Previously, we demonstrated that a single dose of rosuvastatin prevented IR-induced endothelial dysfunction in humans through a cyclooxygenase-2-dependent mechanism. Whether the chronic administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors provides similar protection remains controversial and is unknown in humans. Eighteen male volunteers were randomized to receive a single dose of rosuvastatin (20 mg) or placebo. Twenty-four hours later, endothelium-dependent, radial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was measured before and after IR (15 min of upper arm ischemia followed by 15 min of reperfusion). In a separate protocol, 30 healthy volunteers were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive oral rosuvastatin (20 mg/day) and placebo, rosuvastatin, and celecoxib (100 mg bid) or placebo alone, all for 21 days. Twenty-four hours after the final administration of study medication, FMD was measured before and after IR. Pre-IR FMD was similar between groups in both protocols. In the acute administration protocol, rosuvastatin significantly prevented the blunting of FMD associated with IR (FMD pre-IR: 8.4 \u00b1 1.3%; post-IR: 6.2 \u00b1 1.3%; P = 0.01 ANOVA, treatment group interaction). In the daily administration protocol, IR significantly blunted FMD in the placebo group (FMD pre-IR: 7.5 \u00b1 0.9%; post-IR: 3.3 \u00b1 0.7%; P < 0.001). Chronic treatment with rosuvastatin did not modify this ischemic injury (FMD pre-IR: 6.9 \u00b1 0.4%; post-IR: 1.6 \u00b1 1.0%; P < 0.001; P = NS ANOVA, treatment group interaction). Similarly, FMD responses post-IR in volunteers receiving rosuvastatin and celecoxib did not significantly differ from placebo (FMD pre-IR: 8.3 \u00b1 0.9%; post-IR: 2.1 \u00b1 0.8%; P < 0.001; P = NS ANOVA, treatment group interaction).

    "79": "The latest European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on myocardial revascularisation are reviewed. The nearly 300 recommendations make it difficult to apply them in their totality. The authors would propose 20-30 recommendations per guideline based on sound clinical evidence. Also, the scope of the current guidelines is very wide as it includes topics already incorporated in other guidelines, such as strategies for pre-intervention diagnosis and imaging as well as on secondary prevention. Some recommendations in the new guidelines are sensible and will not be disputed. In particular, the encouragement of a balanced multidisciplinary decision process (the 'heart team') is welcome. Although coronary revascularisation in unstable high risk patients is well accepted, this is less the case for the low risk patient with chest pain. This issue is controversial and a balanced discussion of the pros and cons of percutaneous coronary intervention is missing. Despite convincing evidence indicating lack of benefit of percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion, this procedure is not discouraged. Lastly, most committee members were interventional cardiologists or cardiac surgeons. Guideline committees should be representative of the whole group of professionals as the interpretation of the evidence by specialists may be biased. There may be a role for procedure oriented guidelines but, in that case, the items at issue should remain confined to matters directly related to technical aspects of the procedure.",

    "83": "The beneficial effects of statins have been discussed widely, and their preventative role has been confirmed in cardiovascular disorders, primary and secondary prevention settings, and in asymptomatic subjects with a high cardiovascular risk. Despite these benefits, discontinuation of statins is frequent in cardiac patients and might be associated with adverse outcomes in several conditions involving acute coronary syndromes or acute stroke. In this review, we focus on the mechanistic background of statins that might contribute to such negative changes and that extend beyond cholesterol-lowering effects, including the so-called pleiotropic statin activity. In particular, findings regarding the detrimental impact of statin withdrawal on endothelial function, inflammation, platelet activity or AT1 signaling are discussed, along with the possible clinical implications for statin safety.", 
    "84": "Statins are considered to be safe, well tolerated and the most efficient drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, one of the main risk factor for atherosclerosis, and therefore they are frequently prescribed medications. The most severe adverse effect of statins is myotoxicity, in the form of myopathy, myalgia, myositis or rhabdomyolysis. Clinical trials commonly define statin toxicity as myalgia or muscle weakness with creatine kinase (CK) levels greater than 10 times the normal upper limit. Rhabdomyolysis is the most severe adverse effect of statins, which may result in acute renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and death. The exact pathophysiology of statin-induced myopathy is not fully known. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute to statin myotoxicity. This review focuses on a number of them. The prevention of statin-related myopathy involves using the lowest statin dose required to achieve therapeutic goals and avoiding polytherapy with drugs known to increase systemic exposure and myopathy risk. Currently, the only effective treatment of statin-induced myopathy is the discontinuation of statin use in patients affected by muscle aches, pains and elevated CK levels.",

Expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, thrombomodulin, tissue factor and eNOS was unchanged in atorvastatin and clopidogrel-treated mice. Neither drug inhibited either age-related or radiation-induced atherosclerosis. Furthermore, loss of the inflammatory mediator CD40L did not influence the development of age-related and radiation-induced atherosclerosis.", 
    "88": "The effects of radiation-induced atherosclerosis could not be circumvented by these specific anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant therapies.

Conventional cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and diabetes are common in transplant recipients, partly because of the effects of immunosuppressive drugs, and are associated with adverse outcomes. However, the natural history of cardiovascular disease in such recipients differs from that in the general population, and only statin therapy has been studied in a large-scale interventional trial. Thus, the management of this disease and the balance between management of conventional risk factors and modification of immunosuppression is complex.",

Statins differed in their effectiveness, the rank order of anti-mitogenic potency being simvastatin > atorvastatin > > pravastatin. Nevertheless, a novel nitric oxide-releasing derivative of pravastatin (NCX 6550) was effective. Lipophilic statins, such as simvastatin, also enhanced the anti-proliferative effects of iloprost and sildenafil, promoted apoptosis and inhibited the release of the mitogen and survival factor endothelin-1. These effects were reversed by mevalonate and the isoprenoid intermediate geranylgeranylpyrophosphate and were mimicked by inhibitors of the Rho and Rho-kinase.",

Compared to other statins, it has no excess signal for liver, skeletal muscle or renal toxicity. This is supported by evidence from both an extensive clinical trial program as well as post-marketing surveillance. The incidence of myalgia with this drug is comparable to that observed with other statins. Rosuvastatin does not depend on cytochrome P450 3A4-dependent metabolism and has a favorable drug interaction profile.

Owing to the ability exerted by some antioxidants to modulate the activity and/or the protein levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthetic pathway), their use as additional approach to the management of hypercholesterolemia should be taken into account.

The assay involved a competitive binding reaction between ROS, in plasma sample, and the immobilized ROS-BSA for the binding sites on a limited amount of the anti-ROS antibody. The bound anti-ROS antibody was quantified with horseradish peroxidase-labelled second anti-rabbit IgG antibody (HRP-IgG) and 3,3`,5,5`-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as a substrate for the peroxidase enzyme. The concentration of ROS in the sample was quantified by its ability to inhibit the binding of the anti-ROS antibody to the immobilized ROS-BSA and subsequently the colour intensity in the assay wells. The assay limit of detection was 25 pg ml(-1) and the effective working range at relative standard deviations (RSD) of \u2264 5% was 40-2000 pg ml(-1). Analytical recovery of ROS from spiked plasma was 96.2 - 104.8 \u00b1 2.12 - 5.42%.

The study group consisted of 322 subjects including 265 males and 57 females of overall mean age of 53.6\u00b112 and 7\u00b14 years after OHT. There was coronary artery disease (CAD) before OHT in 113 (35%). The average number of ARE was 1.9\u00b11.9 and CAV was diagnosed in 77 (24%) patients. There were 247 (77%) patients on statins.

Enzyme kinetics of renal Na,K-ATPase were used for characterization of ATP- and Na(+)-binding sites after administration of fish oil (FO) (30 mg\u00b7day(-1)) or atorvastatin (0.5 mg\u00b7100 g(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) to healthy Wistar rats and rats with hereditary hypertriglyceridemia of both genders. Untreated healthy Wistar and also hypertriglyceridemic female rats revealed higher Na,K-ATPase activity as compared to respective untreated male groups. Hypertriglyceridemia itself was accompanied with higher Na,K-ATPase activity in both genders. Fish oil improved the enzyme affinity to ATP and Na(+), as indicated by lowered values of K(m) and K(Na) in Wistar female rats. In Wistar male rats FO deteriorated the enzyme in the vicinity of the Na(+)-binding site as revealed from the increased K(Na) value. In hypertriglyceridemic rats FO induced a significant effect only in females in the vicinity of the sodium binding sites resulting in improved affinity as documented by the lower value of K(Na). Atorvastatin aggravated the properties of Na,K-ATPase in both genders of Wistar rats. In hypertriglyceridemic rats protection of Na,K-ATPase was observed, but this effect was bound to females only. Both treatments protected renal Na,K-ATPase in a gender specific mode, resulting probably in improved extrusion of excessive intracellular sodium out of the cell affecting thus the retention of sodium in hHTG females only.",

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of statins still needs to be elucidated. We previously demonstrated that single doses of different statins rapidly affect Akt signaling via the purinergic receptor P2X7. In particular, statins down-regulated nuclear pAkt. Here, we report that long-term treatment of A549 cells with high concentrations of statins (15-75 \u00b5M) selects cell sub-populations exhibiting altered P2X receptor expression, signs of increased PTEN activity, enhanced PHLPP2, decreased PI3K p110\u03b2 and inhibited downstream pAkt signaling. Furthermore, the nuclear accumulation of pAkt in response to insulin was inhibited in selected cells. Statin-selected cells displayed reduced proliferation rate and were more vulnerable to etoposide- and 5-fluorouracil-elicited cytotoxic effects. The stability of a selected phenotype (50 \u00b5M) was tested for three weeks in the absence of statins. This resulted in a reversal of some, but not all alterations. Importantly, the truncated nuclear insulin response was retained. We conclude that long-term treatment with high doses of statins selects cells exhibiting stable alterations in insulin-Akt signaling and which are vulnerable to DNA damage. Our studies strengthen the hypothesis that an altered Akt signaling has a role in chemopreventive effects of statins.",

The aim of this prospective cohort, multicentre study was to assess the effect of coadministrating ezetimibe 10\u2009mg/day with an ongoing statin on the estimated risk for Cardiovascular (CVD) mortality in patients with persistently elevated LDL-C after statin monotherapy. Methods. The Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) function was used to estimate the 10-year risk for cardiovascular mortality at baseline and 6 weeks. Primary outcome measures were absolute and percent changes in estimated Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Mortality Risk, and general CVD Mortality Risk (Total CVD Mortality Risk). Results. 825 patients were included in the analysis. Mean (SD) age was 62 (10.5) years and 62.3% were males. The mean (SD) estimated Total CVD Mortality Risk decreased from 0.068 (0.059) at baseline to 0.053 (0.046) at 6 weeks (RR = 0.77; 95% CI:0.689-0.867), while the estimated CHD Mortality Risk decreased from 0.047 (0.040) at baseline to 0.034 (0.029) at 6 weeks (RR = 0.72; 95% CI:0.624-0.826).

However, there are limited data on small thrombosed aneurysms as a possible cause of ischemic events. Three patients are reported who presented with acute ischemic stroke and in whom the initial imaging studies showed a small (<10 mm), unruptured, partially thrombosed aneurysm. In each case, the aneurysm location was confirmed by a conventional angiogram. In all cases, the aneurysms were found on the proximal middle cerebral artery, in the territory corresponding to the clinical symptoms of the stroke. The mechanism of middle cerebral artery embolic event was thought to be related to the thrombus within the aneurysm, causing subsequent embolization into distal related vascular territory. Two of these patients had craniotomy for aneurysm clipping; one was managed conservatively with medical therapy alone. Thrombosis of small, unruptured intracranial aneurysms should be considered as a possible cause of acute-onset stroke symptoms in patients with acute ischemic stroke. It is under-recognized in the current literature, and no guidelines currently exist for medical or surgical treatment of such aneurysms. Medical management is often decided on an individual basis.

Whether the statin side effects are related to their intrinsic toxicity or to the decrease of HMGR main isoprenoid end products, which are essential compounds for cell viability, is still debated. In addition to HMGR, the key and rate limiting step of cholesterol synthesis, many enzymes are involved in this multi-step pathway whose inhibition could be taken into account for a \"nonstatin approach\" in the management of hypercholesterolemia. In particular, due to their unique position downstream from HMGR, the inhibition of squalene synthase, farnesyl diphosphate farnesyltransferase (FDFT1), squalene epoxidase (SQLE), and oxidosqualene cyclase:lanosterol synthase (OSC) should decrease plasma levels of cholesterol without affecting ubiquinone, dolichol, and isoprenoid metabolism. Thus, although FDFT1, SQLE and OSC are little studied, they should be considered as perspective targets for the development of novel drugs against hypercholesterolemia. Here, structure-function relationships of FDFT1, SQLE, and OSC are reviewed highlighting the advantages that the downstream inhibition of HMGR could provide when compared to the statin-based therapy.",

This study aimed at examining whether atorvastatin (AVN) modulates cell growth, adhesion, migration, and contraction of cultured human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. The in vitro effects of AVN on human RPE cells was analyzed in terms of cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell adhesion, migration, and contraction assays. The modulatory effect of AVN on TGF-\u03b22-triggered signaling was determined by Western blotting detection. AVN at submicromolar dose exhibited no prominent morphological alteration and cytotoxicity, whereas it elicited cytostatic effect at concentrations higher than 1 \u03bcM. Cell cycle analysis showed that AVN induced growth arrest in both G1 and G2/M phases. AVN at 1 \u03bcM or higher concentrations significantly suppressed RPE cell adhesion. Cell migration and 3D collagen contraction assays showed that AVN significantly suppressed RPE cell migration and contractility, respectively. Mechanistically, AVN treatment transiently up-regulated phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK, whereas down-regulated that of JNK1. Intriguingly, AVN pretreatment prominently attenuated the TGF-\u03b2(2)-mediated non-Smad signaling, including Akt, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK1 phosphorylation. Besides, it directly reduced constitutive level of myosin regulatory light chain peptide MYL9 and mitigated the TGF-\u03b2(2)-induced phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit 1, MYPT1. These in vitro findings strongly suggest that AVN possesses pleiotropic function on RPE cells, including anti-proliferation, anti-adhesion, anti-migration as well as anti-contraction. In conclusion, AVN treatment may be considered a useful therapy for proliferative vitreoretinal diseases.",

Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was diagnosed by confirmation of mutations in genes affecting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or by clinical criteria. A Cox proportional hazard model with time-varying exposure was used to estimate the risk of death and major adverse cardiovascular events among statin-treated patients compared with statin-naive patients.

Lipid abnormalities are a key risk factor for stroke, elevated LDL-cholesterol being the most common abnormality. No clear association has been demonstrated between elevated LDL-cholesterol and stroke incidence, possibly due to the lack of appropriate etiopathophysiological classification of stroke in most studies. Nonetheless, statin therapy is associated with significant reduction in first and recurrent stroke, and there remains a net benefit despite a significant but small increase in hemorrhagic stroke. Following a stroke, indirect evidence supports continuation of prestroke statin therapy while the impact of de novo statin therapy in acute stroke remains uncertain. International guidelines advise an objective assessment of cardiovascular risk to determine the appropriateness of statins for primary prevention and near universal use of statins for secondary prevention after the acute phase of ischemic stroke. There is lack of consensus with regard to the choice of agent, timing of initiation, dose and duration of therapy. Some guidelines advocate high-dose atorvastatin while others suggest the use of simvastatin owing to generic availability and low cost. While the benefits of preventive interventions for stroke are well established and clearly outlined in international guidelines, there is poor application of such measures in clinical practice. This article summarizes the current understanding of the role of statins in stroke prevention and early studies of potential interventions to overcome the barriers to effective statin therapy for secondary prevention. There is a clear need for further research into identifying deficiencies in long-term management, barriers to optimal secondary prevention and novel interventions to overcome these barriers.", 
    "172": "Immunological dysfunction has been described to occur in chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), most notably in association with an inflammatory process. Some pharmacological agents as statins--drugs used in hypercholesterolaemia--display a broad effect on the immune response and thus should be tested in vitro in CIU. Our main objectives were to evaluate the effects of statins on the innate and adaptive immune response in CIU. Simvastatin or lovastatin have markedly inhibited the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferative response induced by T and B cell mitogens, superantigen or recall antigen. Simvastatin arrested phytohaemaglutinin (PHA)-induced T cells at the G0/G1 phase, inhibiting T helper type 1 (Th1), Th2, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-17A cytokine secretion in both patients and healthy control groups. Up-regulation of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) mRNA expression in PHA-stimulated PBMCs from CIU patients was not modified by simvastatin, in contrast to the enhancing effect in the control group. Statin exhibited a less efficient inhibition effect on cytokine production [IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1] induced by Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, to which a statin preincubation step was required. Furthermore, statin did not affect the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 secretion by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PBMC or CD14+ cells in CIU patients. In addition, LPS-activated PBMC from CIU patients showed impaired indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) mRNA expression compared to healthy control, which remained at decreased levels with statin treatment. Statins exhibited a marked down-regulatory effect in T cell functions, but were not able to control TLR-4 activation in CIU patients. The unbalanced regulatory SOCS3 and IDO expressions in CIU may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.", 
    "173": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is initially regulated by androgens, such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, which regulates cell proliferation and survival by activating the androgen receptor (AR), but later progresses to an aggressive, metastatic, androgen-independent stage for which, currently, there is no cure. Here, we argue that prevention of PCa progression is a better strategy compared to trying to cure the disease once it has already progressed. Statins inhibit the mevalonate pathway, thus preventing the synthesis of cholesterol, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate. Multiple clinical studies have shown an inverse relationship between statin use and PCa risk, especially the risk for developing advanced metastatic cancer. Biochemical investigations have largely corroborated the positive effect of statins on PCa risk, showing that statins inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased cell migration and invasion in PCa cells in vitro. However, investigations of the biochemical mechanism of statin action in preventing advanced/high risk PCa remains inconclusive, as statins can act through cholesterol, geranylgeranyl, or farnesyl mediated signals. This review discusses the current clinical and biochemical findings on the use of statins in preventing PCa. Evidence of statin action through cholesterol as well as geranylgeranylation and farnesylation has been discussed. As cholesterol is a precursor of androgen production, it can reduce PCa risk by decreasing the levels of circulating testosterone, which in turn reduces the levels of interprostatic dihydrotestosterone, a strong ligand for the AR. Cholesterol was also shown to accumulate in lipid rafts and regulate the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. However, clinical evidence from multiple studies also point to the existence of cholesterol-independent pathways mediating statin action in PCa patients. In particular, ligand-activated AR activation is seen in early stage PCa and activation of the cholesterol pathway did not indicate an effect on metastasis. Cell migration and invasion, on the other hand, is regulated strongly by members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, especially the Rho family, which is geranylgeranylated. This review, therefore, also compares the effects of statins on both cholesterol and geranylgeranylated and farnesylated small GTPases regulating tumor progression and metastasis in biochemical and clinical studies.", 
    "174": "We describe the case of a 22-year old woman affected by familial hypercholesterolemia, referred for chest pain and treated with angioplasty of left anterior descending coronary artery. Marked systemic inflammation associated with acute coronary syndrome was reduced by 1-month therapy with high dose atorvastatin.", 
    "175": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been extensively applied for the restoration of cardiomyocytes loss after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the optimal therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in ischemic heart diseases has been hampered by their poor survival and low differentiated rates. Therefore, the improvement of MSC survival and differentiated rates is warranted and critical for the efficacy of MSCs in AMI. In this paper, MSCs isolated from rat inguinal fat tissues were termed as adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs), and the fourth passage of ASCs was pre-specified by co-culturing with cardiomyocytes in a transwell system termed as co-ASCs. Fourteen days later, GATA-4 (a transcription factor) and cardiac troponin-I were detected by cellular immunofluorescence. Atorvastatin (Ator group) or vehicle (control group) was administrated for the first 24 h after AMI production in rats. Fourteen days later, inflammatory parameters and cardiac function were evaluated. The other surviving rats were injected with a total of 1 \u00d7 10(6) co-ASCs/100 \u03bcl phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1\u00d710(6) ASCs/100 \u03bcl PBS, or 100 \u03bcl PBS. Twenty-eight days after cell injection, survival and differentiated rates of transplanted cells and cardiac function were evaluated. The percentage of GATA-4 expression in co-ASCs was 28.5% \u00b1 5.6% and of cardiac troponin-I was 22.8% \u00b1 3.2%. Compared with the control group, the number of infiltrating inflammatory cells, myeloperoxidase activity, inflammatory cytokines (VCAM-1, TNF-\u03b1, Hs-CRP) mRNA expression, and Bax protein expression were significantly reduced in the three Ator groups, accompanied by a significant improvement of Bcl-2 protein expression and cardiac function (P< 0.05). Compared with the Ator2 + ASCs group and Con + co-ASCs group, the number of 4-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained cells and cardiac troponin-I-positive transplanted cells, concomitant with cardiac function, were improved most prominently in the Ator3 + co-ASCs group (P< 0.05). Pre-amelioration of the cardiac milieu, in conjunction with pre-specification of ASCs, was beneficial for enhancing ASCs' therapeutic efficacy on cardiac function after AMI.", 
    "176": "Statins are commonly administrated daily, while rosuvastatin can be given every other day due to its longer half-lives. We evaluated the potential efficacy of alternate-day dosing of 10mg rosuvastatin compared with daily dosing of 10mg rosuvastatin with regarding to lipid and inflammatory markers in patients with dyslipidemia.", 
    "177": "Thirty-seven patients were randomly divided into the 2 groups: alternate-day group (rosuvastatin 10mg every other day, n=19) and once-daily group (rosuvastatin 10mg every day, n=18) for 6 weeks. The primary endpoints of the study were changes of the serum concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) following 6-week rosuvastatin therapy.", 
    "178": "Baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were well balanced. LDL-C decreased by 37.5% after the once-daily dosing period and by 36.9% after alternate-day dosing period (p>0.05). Both dosing regimens provided similar improvement in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride. And also, both dosing regimens significantly decreased serum concentrations of CRP, which had an 18.3% reduction in once-daily dosing and a 16.7% reduction in alternate-day dosing of rosuvastatin (p>0.05). Moreover, the pattern of plasma IL-6 concentrations was also similar between the two groups (p>0.05).", 
    "179": "Alternate-day dosing of rosuvastatin could be effective comparable with once-daily dosing of rosuvastatin in Chinese patients in improving not only lipid profile but also inflammatory markers, which may provide some cost savings and increase the compliance of patients.", 
    "180": "Ultrasound protocols to measure carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) vary considerably with regard to carotid sites and angles that are assessed. Measurements from the carotid bifurcation and internal carotid artery are thought to be affected by large numbers of missing data. Actual published quantification of completeness rates and the relation with cardiovascular risk factors, however, is scarce. Also, it is currently unknown whether extensive ultrasound protocols including assessment of the carotid bifurcation and internal carotid artery add information in detecting rate of change in CIMT induced by drug therapy. These issues were addressed in this study using data from Measuring Effects on Intima-Media Thickness: An Evaluation of Rosuvastatin (METEOR).", 
    "181": "In METEOR, carotid ultrasound examinations were performed twice before randomization, once each at 6, 12, and 18 months after randomization, and twice after 24 months of study treatment. B-mode ultrasound images were obtained from the near and far walls of the left and right common carotid artery, bifurcation, and internal carotid artery at five predefined angles. Completeness of CIMT data was assessed by carotid site and by angle. A site was considered complete when any of the five angles was measured. The relation between completeness at baseline and cardiovascular risk factors was assessed using logistic regression analyses. Ultrasound protocols with a reduced number of carotid sites and angles were retrospectively constructed, and differences in the rate of change in maximum CIMT between ultrasound protocols were compared.", 
    "182": "At each visit, CIMT measurements from all 12 carotid sites were available for >94% of the participants. Incompleteness was the highest for near wall of the internal carotid artery and for the extreme angles (60\u00b0 and 300\u00b0). Of 12 risk factors examined, higher body mass index was related to incompleteness. Ultrasound protocols with a reduced number of angles resulted in similar estimates for the differences in rate of change in maximum CIMT. However, reductions in the number of sites gave results in the same direction but with different magnitudes and larger standard errors.", 
    "183": "High levels of complete data can be obtained with extensive ultrasound protocols that include measurement from the carotid bifurcation and internal carotid artery. A high body mass index contributes to incompleteness of CIMT measurements. Extensive ultrasound protocols are required to obtain the highest precision to observe a treatment effect and to fully cover the degree of atherosclerotic burden.", 
    "184": "Although few cardiovascular registries report the costs of illness or cost-effectiveness of health interventions, such information is critical to inform the effective and cost-effective management of cardiovascular disease, particularly if drawn from population-based registries, which more accurately reflect clinical practice and follow up patients for much longer than clinical trials.", 
    "185": "The goal of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of closing the statin \"treatment gap\" in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Australia.", 
    "186": "A decision analysis Markov model was developed with yearly cycles and the health states of alive or dead. Using data from the Australian Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health Registry, the model compared current statin coverage (82%) in the secondary prevention of CAD (the current group) with a hypothetical situation of 100% coverage (the improved group). The 18% gap was filled with use of generic statins. Data from a recent meta-analysis were used to estimate the benefits of statin use in terms of reducing recurrent cardiovascular events and death. Government reimbursement data from 2011 were used to calculate direct health care costs. The cost of the intervention to improve statin coverage was assumed to be $250 per person. Years of life lived and costs were discounted at 5% annually. All values are given in Australian dollars.", 
    "187": "Among the 2058 subjects in the current group, the model estimated that there would be 106 nonfatal myocardial infractions, 68 nonfatal strokes, and 275 deaths over 5 years. In the improved group, all of whom took statins, the corresponding numbers were 101, 65, and 259, equating to numbers needed to treat of 426, 639, and 127, respectively. Over the 5 years, there would be 0.018 life-years gained (discounted) at a net cost of $546 (discounted) per person. These equated to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $29,717 per life-year gained.", 
    "188": "The results suggest that for patients with CAD, maximizing coverage with statins, in line with evidence-based recommendations, represents a cost-effective means of secondary prevention."
