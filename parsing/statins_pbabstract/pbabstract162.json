Four spectrophotometric methods were developed, namely, ratio spectra derivative, ratio subtraction, isosbestic point, and mean centering of ratio spectra. The developed chemometric-assisted spectrophotometric method was the concentration residual augmented classical least-squares method; its prediction ability was assessed and compared to the conventional partial least-squares method. The developed HPLC method used an RP ZORBAX C18 column (5 microm particle size, 250 x 4.6 mm id) with isocratic elution. The mobile phase was acetonitrile-pH 3.5 phosphate buffer (40 + 60, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with UV detection at 230 nm. The accuracy, precision, and linearity ranges of the developed methods were determined. The developed methods were successfully applied for determination of EZ and SM in bulk powder, laboratory-prepared mixtures, and a combined dosage form. The results obtained were compared statistically with each other and to those of a reported HPLC method; there was no significant difference between the proposed methods and the reported method regarding both accuracy and precision.", 
    "1": "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary tumor of bone. The rapid development of metastatic lesions and resistance to chemotherapy remain major mechanisms responsible for the failure of treatments and the poor survival rate for patients. We showed previously that the HMGCoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitor statin exhibits antitumoral effects on osteosarcoma cells. Here, using microarray analysis, we identify Cyr61 as a new target of statins. Transcriptome and molecular analyses revealed that statins downregulate Cyr61 expression in human and murine osteosarcoma cells. Cyr61 silencing in osteosarcoma cell lines enhanced cell death and reduced cell migration and cell invasion compared with parental cells, whereas Cyr61 overexpression had opposite effects. Cyr61 expression was evaluated in 231 tissue cores from osteosarcoma patients. Tissue microarray analysis revealed that Cyr61 protein expression was higher in human osteosarcoma than in normal bone tissue and was further increased in metastatic tissues. Finally, tumor behavior and metastasis occurrence were analyzed by intramuscular injection of modified osteosarcoma cells into BALB/c mice. Cyr61 overexpression enhanced lung metastasis development, whereas cyr61 silencing strongly reduced lung metastases in mice. The results reveal that cyr61 expression increases with tumor grade in human osteosarcoma and demonstrate that cyr61 silencing inhibits in vitro osteosarcoma cell invasion and migration as well as in vivo lung metastases in mice. These data provide a novel molecular target for therapeutic intervention in metastatic osteosarcoma.",

    "11": "Lamin A is a nuclear lamina constituent expressed in differentiated cells. Mutations in the LMNA gene cause several diseases, including muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. Among the nuclear envelope partners of lamin A are Sad1 and UNC84 domain-containing protein 1 (SUN1) and Sad1 and UNC84 domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2), which mediate nucleo-cytoskeleton interactions critical to the anchorage of nuclei. In this study, we show that differentiating human myoblasts accumulate farnesylated prelamin A, which elicits upregulation and recruitment of SUN1 to the nuclear envelope and favors SUN2 enrichment at the nuclear poles. Indeed, impairment of prelamin A farnesylation alters SUN1 recruitment and SUN2 localization. Moreover, nuclear positioning in myotubes is severely affected in the absence of farnesylated prelamin A. Importantly, reduced prelamin A and SUN1 levels are observed in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) myoblasts, concomitant with altered myonuclear positioning. These results demonstrate that the interplay between SUN1 and farnesylated prelamin A contributes to nuclear positioning in human myofibers and may be implicated in pathogenetic mechanisms.",

However, few selective small-molecule inhibitors of TF are available, and the present assays for measuring TF activity are relatively expensive and complex. The authors present a simple and high-throughput chromogenic assay for screening TF inhibitors based on using commercial human prothrombin complex instead of purified coagulation factors, reducing the dosage, and performing with a one-stage procedure. In the optimized assay, <45 \u00b5L cell lysates was incubated with Tris-CaCl(2) buffer (pH 7.3) containing human prothrombin complex at 37\u00b0C for 15 min in 96-well or 384-well plates. Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 8.4) containing chromogenic substrate Xa was then added and the absorbance measured at 405 nm. This simplified assay was more sensitive or precise than some reported methods for TF procoagulant activities. Two known active compounds (curcumin and simvastatin) inhibiting TF activity were tested by the simplified assay to validate the screening method. Furthermore, berberine and cryptotanshinone suppressed TF activity induced by lipopolysaccharides in human monocytes by this assay and might be promising new TF inhibitors.",

In these implants, fluvastatin was also able to increase NO production, as detected with an NO-sensitive electrode. 4. The inhibitory function of fluvastatin on key components of intraperitoneal inflammatory angiogenesis shown in the present study is clearly associated with the modulatory effects of this statin on vascular endothelial growth factor, TNF-\u03b1 and NO production.", 
    "29": "This review addresses the roles of Rho/Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications. Diabetes can cause many serious complications and can result in physical disability or even increased mortality. However, there are not many effective ways to treat these complications. The small guanosine-5'-triphosphate-binding protein Rho and its downstream target Rho-kinase mediate important cellular functions, such as cell morphology, motility, secretion, proliferation, and gene expression. Recently, the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway has attracted a great deal of attention in diabetes-related research. These studies have provided evidence that the activity and gene expression of Rho-kinase are upregulated in some tissues in animal models of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and in cell lines cultured with high concentrations of glucose. Inhibitors of Rho-kinase could prevent or ameliorate the pathological changes in diabetic complications. The inhibitory effects of statins on the Rho/Rho-kinase signalling pathway may also play a role in the prevention of diabetic complications. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which the Rho/Roh-kinase pathway participates in the development or progression of diabetic complications has not been extensively investigated. This article evaluates the relationship between Rho/Roh-kinase activation and diabetic complications, as well as the roles of Roh-kinase inhibitors and statins in the complications of diabetes, with the objective of providing a novel target for the treatment of long-term diabetic complications.",

These lineage-specific molecular programs are instructive to the development of distinct vascular architectures and physiological conditions of arteries and veins, but their roles in angiogenesis remain unexplored. Here, we show that the caudal vein plexus in zebrafish forms by endothelial cell sprouting, migration and anastomosis, providing a venous-specific angiogenesis model. Using this model, we have identified a novel compound, aplexone, which effectively suppresses venous, but not arterial, angiogenesis. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that aplexone differentially regulates arteriovenous angiogenesis by targeting the HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) pathway. Treatment with aplexone affects the transcription of enzymes in the HMGCR pathway and reduces cellular cholesterol levels. Injecting mevalonate, a metabolic product of HMGCR, reverses the inhibitory effect of aplexone on venous angiogenesis. In addition, aplexone treatment inhibits protein prenylation and blocking the activity of geranylgeranyl transferase induces a venous angiogenesis phenotype resembling that observed in aplexone-treated embryos. Furthermore, endothelial cells of venous origin have higher levels of proteins requiring geranylgeranylation than arterial endothelial cells and inhibiting the activity of Rac or Rho kinase effectively reduces the migration of venous, but not arterial, endothelial cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that angiogenesis is differentially regulated by the HMGCR pathway via an arteriovenous-dependent requirement for protein prenylation in zebrafish and human endothelial cells.",

Independent predictors of recurrent HF admission included history of HF [odds ratio (OR) 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.2, P < 0.01] and renal dysfunction (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.4, P < 0.01). At 12 months, patients with HF had lower rates of statin (73.9 vs. 89.2%, P < 0.01) and beta-blocker use (55.6 vs. 59.0%, P < 0.01). Angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use was also relatively low in HF patients (79.6%).",

    "54": "Dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events. Mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood but may include beneficial effects on physical conditioning and vagal tone. We investigated the association of n-3 fatty acid levels to exercise parameters in 992 subjects with stable coronary artery disease. Cross-sectional associations of heart rate recovery time, treadmill exercise capacity, and exercise time with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels were evaluated in multivariable linear and logistic regression models adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, co-morbidities, self-reported physical activity, medication use, and left ventricular function. After multivariable adjustment, n-3 fatty acid levels (DHA + EPA) were strongly associated with heart rate recovery (beta 2.1, p = 0.003), exercise capacity (beta 0.8, p <0.0001), and exercise time (beta 0.9, p <0.0001). Increasing levels of (DHA + EPA) were also associated with decreased risk of impaired heart rate recovery (odds ratio 0.8, p = 0.004) and exercise time (odds ratio 0.7, p = 0.01) and trended toward significance for exercise capacity (odds ratio 0.8, p = 0.07). These associations were not modified by demographics, body mass index, smoking, co-morbid conditions, statin use, or \u03b2-blocker use (p for interaction >0.1 for all comparisons). In conclusion, an independent association exists between n-3 fatty acid levels and important exercise parameters in patients with stable coronary artery disease. These findings support the hypothesis that n-3 fatty acids may increase vagal tone and physical conditioning.",

At week 52, mean CHD risk was 12.5% in the proactive intervention arm and 16.3% in the UC arm (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The difference, observed at weeks 16 and 52, was primarily driven by significant differences in systolic BP and in TC between the two arms. Overall, adverse events (AEs) were reported in 48.8% and 44.0% of patients in the proactive intervention and the UC arm, respectively. Although there were differences in the incidence of AEs between the treatment arms, the AE profile in the proactive intervention arm was consistent with previous safety experience for this medication.",

    "61": "Ocimum sanctum (OS) has a lipid-lowering action in both normal and diabetic animals. Because OS leaves are rich in oil, the present study was conducted to explain the anti-hyperlipidemic and organ-protective effect of OS fixed oil in rats fed with a high fat (HF) diet. OS fixed oil was extracted by hexane and the fatty acids composition identified by GC-MS. Four groups of male Wistar rats included a normal control group, a high fat fed-diet (HF) group, a HF group treated with OS fixed oil, and a HF group treated with a reference drug simvastatin. The results show that OS fixed oil contains five kinds of fatty acids, of which alpha-linolenic acid was the major fatty acid. OS fixed oil depressed high serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-C, and AI, whereas no significant effect on HDL-C was observed. OS fixed oil also suppressed high levels of liver cholesterol and triglyceride with no significant effect on both lipids in feces. In addition, OS fixed oil normalized the high serum levels of LDH and CK-MB but no significant effect on high serum levels of ALT, AST, and ALP was obtained. We conclude that treatment with OS fixed oil during the last three weeks of HF diet feeding decreased the high serum lipid profile and expressed antiartherogenic and cardioprotective actions against hyperlipidemia. The anti-hyperlipidemic action of OS fixed oil was mainly resulted from the suppression of liver lipid synthesis. Linolenic acid and linoleic acid contained in OS fixed oil were possibly responsible for both lipid-lowering and cardiac protective action against hyperlipidemia.", 
    "62": "The acute-phase response (APR) is frequently observed in patients treated with intravenous (iv) zoledronate (ZOL). We investigated whether a short course of rosuvastatin (ROSU) could attenuate the ZOL--induced APR through blocking the mevalonate pathway at a proximal level. Twenty-eight osteoporotic postmenopausal women with no prior bisphosphonate use (mean age 65.3 \u00b1 1.9 years) were subjected to ZOL iv infusion. Patients were randomly assigned into either a ROSU+ group (n = 12), which received ROSU 10 mg/day starting 5 days before the infusion of ZOL for a total period of 11 days, or a ROSU- group (n = 16), which did not receive ROSU. The visual analog pain scale (VAS) for musculoskeletal symptoms and body temperature was used to define clinically APR. In addition, white blood cell (WBC) count, leukocytic subpopulations, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were obtained before and 48 h following the infusion. Seven (58.3%) patients in the ROSU+ group and 13 (81.3%) in the ROSU- group experienced APR (P = not significant). No difference was found in fever and VAS measurements. CRP and granulocytes increased significantly in both groups; WBC count increased, while lymphocytes and eosinophils decreased significantly only in the ROSU- group. In a post hoc analysis of only patients with an APR, all laboratory parameters exhibited a similar significant change solely within the ROSU- group. In conclusion, our data suggest that a short course of ROS at this dose cannot prevent the ZOL-induced APR among osteoporotic women. Milder changes in acute-phase laboratory parameters in ROSU+ patients suggest that studies with higher doses may be warranted.", 
    "63": "Statins inhibit the proximal steps of cholesterol biosynthesis, and are linked to health benefits in various conditions, including cancer and lung disease. We have previously investigated apoptotic pathways triggered by statins in airway mesenchymal cells, and identified reduced prenylation of small GTPases as a primary effector mechanism leading to p53-mediated cell death. Here, we extend our studies of statin-induced cell death by assessing endpoints of both apoptosis and autophagy, and investigating their interplay and coincident regulation. Using primary cultured human airway smooth muscle (HASM) and human airway fibroblasts (HAF), autophagy, and autophagosome formation and flux were assessed by transmission electron microscopy, cytochemistry (lysosome number and co-localization with LC3) and immunoblotting (LC3 lipidation and Atg12-5 complex formation). Chemical inhibition of autophagy increased simvastatin-induced caspase activation and cell death. Similarly, Atg5 silencing with shRNA, thus preventing Atg5-12 complex formation, increased pro-apoptotic effects of simvastatin. Simvastatin concomitantly increased p53-dependent expression of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), NOXA, and damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM). Notably both mevalonate cascade inhibition-induced autophagy and apoptosis were p53 dependent: simvastatin increased nuclear p53 accumulation, and both cyclic pifithrin-\u03b1 and p53 shRNAi partially inhibited NOXA, PUMA expression and caspase-3/7 cleavage (apoptosis) and DRAM expression, Atg5-12 complex formation, LC3 lipidation, and autophagosome formation (autophagy). Furthermore, the autophagy response is induced rapidly, significantly delaying apoptosis, suggesting the existence of a temporally coordinated p53 regulation network. These findings are relevant for the development of statin-based therapeutic approaches in obstructive airway disease.", 
    "64": "It is well established that statins improve the prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. However, it is still unclear whether the protective effects of statins relate to lipid lowering alone or whether other pleiotropic effects may contribute. Thus, we compared the endothelial function among two groups of diabetic patients treated with fluvastatin 60 mg (F60) or fluvastatin 20 mg combined with ezetimibe 10 mg (F20/E10). The endothelial function was evaluated by measuring flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) at baseline and follow-up at 10 weeks. Similar improvements in FMD were observed in the two groups. The reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was less pronounced in the F60 group, compared with the F20/E10 group. A significant reduction in remnant-like lipoprotein particles cholesterol (RLP-C) was observed in the F20/E10 group, but not in the F60 group. A correlation between the observed reduction in LDL-C or RLP-C and the improvement in FMD was observed in F20/E10 group. These results suggest that high-dose fluvastatin might have pleiotropic effects of potential clinical benefit, and that the combination of ezetimibe with a reduced dose of fluvastatin may also significantly improve endothelial function with reduction of LDL-C and RLP-C.",

The nephrotic syndrome may be the clinical manifestation of a row of underlying diseases. The pathophysiological basics had remained elusive for decades, yet recently significant progress which allows for establishing new therapeutic strategies has been made. A major breakthrough in understanding the function of the glomerular filter unit has been possible in the last years through both genetic and cell biological studies, which have revealed a crucial role for the visceral epithelial cells of the glomerulus - the podocytes. By now various factors have been found causing podocyte damage, such as toxines, immunological phenomena or systemic disease like diabetes mellitus.",

HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) also alter Notch signaling in vascular cells, but the mechanism and involvement of Notch and VEGF signaling in statin-mediated angiogenesis remain unclear. Here, we examined how statins activate the endothelial Notch1, and promote angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. We examined blood flow recovery after hindlimb ischemia in wild-type (WT) and Notch1 mutant mice treated with or without pitavastatin (3 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Although VEGF induction was not altered in ischemic limbs, pitavastatin promoted blood flow recovery in ischemic limbs in control mice but not in Notch1 mutant mice. Furthermore, pitavastatin induced endothelial ephrinB2 downstream of Notch1 and increased the density of both capillaries and arterioles in the ischemic limbs of WT but not of Notch1 mutant mice. Pitavastatin (100 nmol/l) rapidly activated \u03b3-secretase and Notch1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells without VEGF induction, which was suppressed by pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of Akt. Pitavastatin also augmented endothelial proliferation and tube formation on Matrigel, which were suppressed by either \u03b3-secretase inhibition or knockdown of Notch1. Pitavastatin-induced microvascular sprouting was also impaired in Notch1 mutant aortic explants. Taken together, pitavastatin activates Notch1 through Akt-dependent stimulation of \u03b3-secretase in endothelial cells, and thereby increases vasculogenesis without VEGF induction.",

To further understand the causes of the damage we performed a proteome analysis in fast-twitch skeletal muscle of rats chronically treated with different hypolipidemic drugs. The proteomic maps were obtained from extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of rats treated for 2-months with 10mg/kg atorvastatin, 20 mg/kg fluvastatin, 60 mg/kg fenofibrate and control rats. The proteins differentially expressed were identified by mass spectrometry and further analyzed by immunoblot analysis. We found a significant modification in 40 out of 417 total spots analyzed in atorvastatin treated rats, 15 out of 436 total spots in fluvastatin treated rats and 21 out of 439 total spots in fenofibrate treated rats in comparison to controls. All treatments induced a general tendency to a down-regulation of protein expression; in particular, atorvastatin affected the protein pattern more extensively with respect to the other treatments. Energy production systems, both oxidative and glycolytic enzymes and creatine kinase, were down-regulated following atorvastatin administration, whereas fenofibrate determined mostly alterations in glycolytic enzymes and creatine kinase, oxidative enzymes being relatively spared. Additionally, all treatments resulted in some modifications of proteins involved in cellular defenses against oxidative stress, such as heat shock proteins, and of myofibrillar proteins. These results were confirmed by immunoblot analysis. In conclusions, the proteomic analysis showed that either statin or fibrate administration can modify the expression of proteins essential for skeletal muscle function suggesting potential mechanisms for statin myopathy.",

    "109": "This review summarizes genetic factors predisposed to statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. The first genetic risk factor of statin myopathy uncovered by genome-wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms was the common variant of SLCO1B1 gene. Analysis of 30000 genetic markers in 85 patients with myopathy induced by high-dose simvastatin showed a strong association with 521T>C polymorphism of SLCO1B1. Another study also showed that this variant of SLCO1B1 has a significant association with myopathy in patients taking pravastatin or atorvastatin although the number of patients analyzed was limited. In addition to SLCO1B1, recent studies suggested that variants of genes encoding transporters (ABCG2 and ABCB1) and metabolic enzymes (CYP2C8 and UGT1A3) involved in the disposition of statins, and those involved in the metabolic muscle disease (glycogen storage disorders, carnitine palmitoyl-2 deficiency and myoadenylate deaminase deficiency) are also risk factors of statin-induced myopathy. These genetic factors may provide predisposition testing for statin-induced rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "110": "Although statins significantly decrease the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), residual CVD risk remains high. This may partly be due to uncorrected atherogenic dyslipidaemia. The driving force behind atherogenic dyslipidaemia is hypertriglyceridaemia, which results from hepatic oversecretion and/or hypocatabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and is typical of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Persistent atherogenic dyslipidaemia in patients treated with a statin according to low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol goals may be corrected with niacin, fibrates or n-3 fatty acids. Clinical trial evidence to inform best practice is limited, but new data support adding fenofibrate to a statin. A consistent feature of fibrate clinical trials is the specific benefit of these agents in dyslipidaemic patients and the improvement in diabetic retinopathy with fenofibrate. Ongoing clinical trials may provide good evidence for adding niacin to a statin. Low-dose n-3 fatty acids could be used routinely after a myocardial infarction, but the value of higher doses of n-3 fatty acids in reducing CVD risk remains to be demonstrated.",

In this review, the use of margarines containing stanol or sterol esters, to lower LDL cholesterol is considered in the 2011 setting. Firstly, there is a brief overview of the effects of the stanols/sterols on LDL cholesterol, which shows that these agents have a modest ability to lower LDL cholesterol, and are not effective in all conditions. Secondly, the relevance of the stanols/sterols in 2010/1 is questioned, given they have not been shown to reduce clinical endpoints, and have no effects on HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Finally, there is a section comparing the stanols/sterols with the present day prescription lipid lowering medicines. Prescription drugs (statins, ezetimibe, and niacin) have a much greater ability to lower LDL cholesterol than the stanol/sterol esters, and also increase levels of HDL cholesterol and decrease levels of triglycerides. The statins and niacin have been shown to reduce cardiovascular clinical endpoints. Except in borderline normo/hypercholesterolemia, prescription drugs should be preferred to stanol/sterol esters for lowering LDL cholesterol in 2011.",

For all prespecified comparisons, patients randomized to eze/simva were found to have significantly greater percentage decreases in LDL-C and were significantly more likely to achieve LDL-C target levels compared with those on atorvastatin monotherapy (p < 0.05 to < 0.001). Also, the proportions of subjects reaching secondary biochemical targets were similarly greater with eze/simva than with atorvastatin monotherapy for all prespecified comparisons (p < 0.01 to < 0.001).

We focus on the recent medical literature on the use of hs-CRP in cardiovascular disease risk stratification and management, including updated screening guidelines on the use of hs-CRP, such as those issued in 2009 by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society. We also discuss the Reynolds Risk Score, which incorporates hs-CRP and family history with more standard cardiovascular risk factors (eg, tobacco use, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) and frequently leads to improved recategorization of cardiovascular disease risk levels. As the recently completed Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial indicated that statin therapy decreases the vascular events among persons with elevated hs-CRP by half, even when cholesterol levels are low, the inclusion of information on hs-CRP values with other cardiovascular risk factors may assist physicians in medical decision making for patients.",

This study aims to evaluate Simvastatin on the inflammatory response and heart functionality using dogs infected with Y strain of T. cruzi. Animals were treated daily with Simvastatin (20 mg) for 6 months and submitted to clinical and immunopathological evaluations. Simvastatin reduced heart expression and serum levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) but not interleukin-10 (IL-10), possibly favoring blood parasitism but reducing inflammation and fibrosis in the left ventricle and right atrium. Simvastatin also ameliorated ejection fraction, diastolic diameter, and mass index of the left ventricle 6 months after infection. This study suggests that more investigation should be performed on the use of statins as a prophylactic therapy against cardiac remodeling because of their effects on modifying immune response and benefiting functional parameters in dogs with T. cruzi-induced ventricular dysfunctions.",

We investigated the plasma high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin level and its relationship to visceral fat area (VFA) and various markers of atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. In a cross-sectional study, conventional cardiovascular risk factors, plasma total and HMW adiponectin, the number of components of the metabolic syndrome and, using computed tomography, the distribution of abdominal adiposity were assessed in 144 hemodialysis patients (90 men and 54 women; mean age, 60.7 years) and 30 age- and sex-matched patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Plasma HMW adiponectin levels in hemodialysis patients were significantly higher than those in patients with CKD, negatively associated with VFA and serum triglycerides and positively associated with plasma total adiponectin, as well as the HMW-to-total adiponectin ratio in men and women (all P < 0.05) in a simple regression analysis. In a multiple regression analysis, VFA was a significant determinant of HMW adiponectin in hemodialysis patients. Furthermore, after adjustment for classical risk factors, HMW adiponectin levels were significantly higher in patients undergoing treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or calcium channel blockers compared with patients not undergoing such treatment. This study shows that plasma HMW adiponectin levels were negatively associated with VFA and positively associated with treatment with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and of the calcium channel. Therefore, these drugs might be effective for improving adipocytokine-related metabolic abnormalities in hemodialysis patients.", 
    "142": "Enhanced vascular arginase activity impairs endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by decreasing l-arginine availability to endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, thereby reducing NO production. Elevated angiotensin II (ANG II) is a key component of endothelial dysfunction in many cardiovascular diseases and has been linked to elevated arginase activity. We determined signaling mechanisms by which ANG II increases endothelial arginase function. Results show that ANG II (0.1 \u03bcM, 24 h) elevates arginase activity and arginase I expression in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and decreases NO production. These effects are prevented by the arginase inhibitor BEC (100 \u03bcM). Blockade of ANG II AT(1) receptors or transfection with small interfering RNA (siRNA) for G\u03b112 and G\u03b113 also prevents ANG II-induced elevation of arginase activity, but siRNA for G\u03b1q does not. ANG II also elevates active RhoA levels and induces phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Inhibitors of RhoA activation (simvastatin, 0.1 \u03bcM) or Rho kinase (ROCK) (Y-27632, 10 \u03bcM; H1152, 0.5 \u03bcM) block both ANG II-induced elevation of arginase activity and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, pretreatment of BAECs with p38 inhibitor SB-202190 (2 \u03bcM) or transfection with p38 MAPK siRNA prevents ANG II-induced increased arginase activity/expression and maintains NO production. Additionally, inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB-203580, 5 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) or arginase (ABH, 8 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1)) or arginase gene knockout in mice prevents ANG II-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction and associated enhancement of arginase. These results indicate that ANG II increases endothelial arginase activity/expression through G\u03b112/13 G proteins coupled to AT(1) receptors and subsequent activation of RhoA/ROCK/p38 MAPK pathways leading to endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "143": "Angina in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease, sometimes referred to as cardiac syndrome X (CSX), is a debilitating condition that disproportionately affects women. More than 50% of women evaluated for angina have non-obstructive disease by cardiac catheterization, although the total numbers of women affected by CSX are unknown. Varying clinical definitions and the lack of large scale epidemiologic studies focusing on this illness have resulted in limited knowledge about its risk factors, although there appears to be an association with black race, estrogen deficiency, and insulin resistance. Contrary to prior beliefs about the benign nature of this entity, these women suffer considerable morbidity with costly economic implications that approach the lifetime costs of healthcare utilization for those with obstructive coronary disease. Two prevailing hypotheses have emerged to explain CSX: the ischemic hypothesis detailing abnormal coronary microvascular function and the non-ischemic hypothesis describing altered pain perception and myocardial hypersensitivity. Treatment strategies have focused on both of these pathways with the main goal of improving symptoms. Beta blockers provide the most convincing evidence for benefit, with other antianginals having secondary roles. Other promising pharmacologic therapies include xanthine derivatives, estrogen replacement therapy, ACE inhibitors, and statin medications, among other emerging treatment options. Neurostimulation and lifestyle factors including exercise can also be beneficial in reducing symptoms. However, managing patients with CSX can be frustrating for both patients and physicians, as there is a lack of data regarding an optimal treatment algorithm including few large-scale randomized controlled trials to clarify effective therapies.", 
    "144": "Receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) is a nuclear receptor coregulator that affects a wide spectrum of biological processes. It is unclear whether and how the expression level of RIP140 can be modulated and whether RIP140 is involved in inflammatory diseases. Here, we examine how intracellular cholesterol regulates RIP140 expression, and we evaluate the effect of RIP140 expression on macrophage proinflammatory potential. Macrophages treated with modified low-density lipoprotein express higher RIP140 mRNA and protein levels. Consistently, simvastatin reduces RIP140 levels, which can be reversed by mevalonate. Moreover, a high-fat diet elevates RIP140 but lowers miR-33 levels in peritoneal macrophages, and increases the production of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in macrophages. Mechanistically, miR-33 targets RIP140 mRNA by recognizing its target located in a highly conserved sequence of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RIP140 mRNA. Consequentially, miR-33 reduces RIP140 coactivator activity for NF-\u03baB, which is supported by the reduction in NF-\u03baB reporter activity and the inflammatory potential in macrophages. This study uncovers a cholesterol-miR-33-RIP140 regulatory pathway that modulates the proinflammatory potential in macrophages in response to an alteration in the intracellular cholesterol status, and identifies RIP140 as a direct target of miR-33 that mediates simvastatin-triggered anti-inflammation.", 
    "145": "In a previous issue of Annals of Medicine, we presented evidence in support of the concept that an abnormally increased production of reactive oxygen species plays a central role in the genesis and progression of cardiovascular disease. While a number of preclinical lines of evidence support this concept, and despite the results of many studies suggesting a beneficial impact of antioxidant drugs on endothelial function, large clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a benefit of antioxidants on cardiovascular outcomes. Studies exploring the possibility that classical antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, or folic acid may improve the prognosis of patients with cardiac disease have substantially reported neutral-and occasionally negative-results. In contrast, medications such as statins, ACE inhibitors, certain \u03b2-blockers, or angiotensin I receptor blockers, which possess indirect 'ancillary' antioxidant properties, have been associated with beneficial effects in both preclinical studies and large clinical trials. The reasons for the failure of the 'direct' approach to antioxidant therapy, and for the success of the therapy with these drugs, are discussed in the present review.",

The association between acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and elevated serum high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) suggests that chronic inflammation of the coronary arterial wall may play an important role. A number of drugs used in the treatment of cardiovascular disease reduce serum CRP. It* is therefore possible that reduced inflammation contributes to the beneficial effects of these medications. This was a double blind randomized clinical trial on 52 patients were admitted because of ACS at the Mazandaran Heart Center, Iran in 2007. The patients were divided to three randomized groups which received 20, 40, 80* mg Atorvastatin daily for 6 months. At the time of study enrollment and 1, 3 and 6 months after initiation hsCRP were measured. 1 and 3 month after 20mg atorvastatin therapy the median serum concentration of hsCRP did not decrease significantly, but at the end of 6th month it was* significant difference. At 40 mg dosage from 3rd month to 6th month versus 1st month to 3rd month it was significant decrease, at the end of 1st month and 3rd month it was not significant. At 80 mg dose at the end of 1st month it was not significant but at the* end of 3rd month and end of 6th month it was significant. Intensive lipid-lowering therapy with high-dose atorvastatin therapy relative to moderate lipid-lowering therapy with low-dose atorvastatin reduces hsCRP better. We found that treatment with greater dose of atorvastatin might decrease greater in plasma level of hsCRP.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of LPS on the transmural contractile tension induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) of human isolated bronchi. The possible contribution of Rho/Ras signaling pathways was examined by using geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP), the selective geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate-transferase inhibitor GGTI2133, and the selective farnesyl-pyrophosphate transferase inhibitor FTI276, the hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin and the Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein serine/threonine kinase inhibitor Y27632. LPS (300 ng/ml) significantly enhanced the EFS-induced contractile force of human bronchi (P < 0.05). The plateau was reached at 105.0 (\u00b14.1) minutes; the maximal effect (Emax) value was 267.47 (\u00b18.88) %, with a time to evoke a half-maximal contraction (t(1/2)) of 40.5 (\u00b12.0) minutes. Pretreatment with GGPP (5 \u03bcM) enhanced the EFS-mediated contractile tension (Emax, 164.56 \u00b1 9.80% and the t(1/2) 23.0 \u00b1 2.5 min). Pretreatment with FPP (5 \u03bcM) was effective, as was GGPP, in enhancing the EFS response (Emax, of 189.23 \u00b1 12.98% and a t(1/2) of 17.0 \u00b1 4.5 min). Furthermore, GGTI2133 (500 nM) and FTI276 (10 nM) significantly inhibited the effects of GGPP and FPP on EFS-induced response. Pretreatment with GGPP (5 \u03bcM) significantly enhanced the EFS response compared with the control and LPS-treated tissues; GGTI2133 (500 nM) significantly inhibited the EFS-induced contractile tension in LPS (300 ng/ml)-treated tissues, and it was not possible to calculate the t(1/2). In addition, simvastatin and Y27632 (both 1 \u03bcM) were effective in abolishing the contracturant effect of LPS. Our results provide mechanistic evidence for the enhanced bronchoconstriction induced by LPS in human isolated airways, the contribution of Rho/Ras pathways in this LPS response, and the protective role of statins.", 
    "169": "Prostate cancer is a slowly developing but very common cancer in males that may be amenable to preventive strategies that are not toxic. Chinese red yeast rice (RYR), a food herb made by fermenting Monascus purpureus Went yeast on white rice, contains a mixture of eight different monacolins that inhibit cholesterogenesis in addition to red pigments with antioxidant properties. Monacolin K is identical to lovastatin (LV), but LV unlike RYR can be used in individuals intolerant to statins due to muscle pain. Both LV and RYR inhibit de novo cholesterogenesis, which is critical to the growth of tumor cells. Long-term use of statin drugs has been associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. We have previously shown that RYR inhibited androgen-dependent and androgen receptor-overexpressing androgen-independent prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro. This study was designed to determine whether RYR and LV inhibit prostate tumor growth in SCID mice. RYR significantly reduced tumor volumes of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate xenograft tumors compared with animals receiving vehicle alone (P < 0.05). Inhibition by RYR was greater than that observed with LV at the dose found in RYR, showing that other compounds in RYR contributed to the antiproliferative effect. There was a significant correlation of tumor volume to serum cholesterol (P < 0.001). RYR decreased gene expression of androgen synthesizing enzymes (HSD3B2, AKR1C3, and SRD5A1) in both type of tumors (P < 0.05). Clinical studies of RYR for prostate cancer prevention in the increasing population of men undergoing active surveillance should be considered.", 
    "170": "Cardiac glycosides, statins, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used cardiovascular medications with pleiotropic properties. Many of these medications have been investigated in other diseases, including cancer. Cardiac glycosides and statins have advanced to clinical trial testing in cancer therapeutics, with variable success. Early observations in breast cancer were consistent with a more benign histologic phenotype among women taking digitalis compared to their counterparts who did not receive cardiac glycosides. Cardiac glycosides can induce apoptosis in cancer cells through various mechanisms and sensitize them to the effects of antitumor therapy. By blocking the generation of prenyl units, statins impair prenylation, an important posttranslational modification of proteins whose function depends on membrane anchoring. Statins also impair protein folding and N-glycosylation and inhibit the upregulation of cholesterol synthesis associated with chemotherapy resistance. Stress and catecholamine release promote tumor growth and angiogenesis, effects that can be mitigated by \u03b2-blockers. Components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are expressed in various cancers and are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Angiotensin II has potent mitogenic and angiogenic properties that can be blocked with ACEIs and ARBs. Although it is unclear whether the promising preclinical activity of many cardiovascular medications has clinically meaningful implications beyond the benefit in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the prevention or improvement of prognosis of common malignancies with medications known to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is encouraging and deserves further clinical investigation.", 
    "171": "The staggering number of publications featuring the use of stem cells has revolutionized regenerative medicine research. Preclinical studies indicate that allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be useful for the treatment of several clinical disorders, including sepsis, acute renal failure, acute myocardial infarction, and more recently, acute lung injury (ALI). However, considerable success would not be obtained in clinical trials due to poor survival of transplanted cells under the influence of inflammatory conditions. Despite robust approaches like cellular reprogramming, scaffolds and conditioned media have been tested to overcome this problem; however the success rate of these approaches remain questionable. Recently, pretreatment of bioactive compounds in vitro have been shown to suppress cell apoptosis and promote cell survival. Quite likely a similar phenomenon can take place in vivo. Based on such studies, we hypothesize that MSCs derived from human post-natal tissues could be conditioned and prepared for targeted disease therapy. Depending on the disease condition, the MSCs could be treated prior to delivery with appropriate bioactive compounds to allow them survive longer and perform a better role as biocatalyst. The advantage of this approach could be the tailor made availability of MSCs preconditioned with appropriate bioactive compounds for disease specific therapy. Therefore, the choice of suitable bioactive molecule is likely to enhance the efficacy of targeted stem cell therapy and preconditioning may provide a novel strategy in maximizing biological and functional properties of MSCs.",

Anti-inflammatory effects of fenofibrate partly correlated with the improvement in insulin sensitivity. Lymphocyte-suppressing, but not monocyte-suppressing, effect was stronger if these 2 agents were administered together. In conclusion, simvastatin and fenofibrate exhibit a similar effect on the secretory function of human monocytes and lymphocytes and on systemic inflammation in type 2 diabetic subjects with mixed dyslipidemia.

The single treatment with AM or AT itself exerted neuroprotective effects with reducing inductions of MMP-9 and AT2R, as well as with preserving collagen IV, and the combination therapy of AM plus AT showed a further synergistic benefit against acute ischemic neural damages. Single AT was more protective on these 3 molecules than single AM at this time point of 24h after tMCAO.

    "206": "The aim of our study was to compare the effect of simvastatin on a range of hemostatic variables in subjects with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and isolated hypercholesterolemia. We enrolled 28 subjects with IFG, 25 primary hypercholesterolemic patients and 24 age-, sex- and weight-matched control subjects with normal lipid profile and glucose metabolism. The tested parameters (lipid profile, fasting and 2-h post-glucose load plasma glucose levels, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) ratio, glycated hemoglobin, the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time, plasma fibrinogen, PAI-1 levels and factor VII coagulant activity) were determined at baseline and after 4 and 12 weeks of simvastatin treatment (20 mg/daily). Compared to the control subjects, hypercholesterolemic and IFG patients exhibited increased plasma levels of fibrinogen and PAI-1 and increased factor VII activity. PAI-1 was higher in hypercholesterolemic than in IFG patients. Simvastatin improved lipid profile in both groups of patients, but it did not influence glucose metabolism. In both IFG and hypercholesterolemic patients, simvastatin reduced fibrinogen and PAI-1 levels and factor VII activity, and it prolonged the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time in a lipid- and glucose-independent manner. The main conclusion of our study is that early glucose metabolism abnormalities are associated with disturbed coagulation and fibrinolysis, which contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Treatment with a lipid lowering agent may bring multidirectional beneficial effects on hemostasis in IFG patients.", 
    "207": "Pulmonary embolism remains the major malingerer of acute chest disease. The clinical and electrocardiographic manifestations may deviate to a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. We report a case of bilateral pulmonary embolism in a patient of 50 years. The electrocardiogram showed ST elevation in anteroseptal and lateral leads. The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was selected and a fibrinolysis achieved. Getting out under beta-blocker therapy, antiplatelet, statin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors after 10 days hospitalization, the patient was readmitted one month later for a massive pulmonary embolism. Coronary angiography performed after the second hospitalization was normal.", 
    "208": "To compare the effects of simvastatin alone versus simvastatin plus ezetimibe on small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (sdLDL-C) concentration in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "209": "Patients with LDL-C levels above those recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III were randomized to open-label simvastatin 40\u2009mg (n\u2009=\u200950) or simvastatin/ezetimibe 10/10\u2009mg as a fixed combination (n\u2009=\u200950) daily. LDL particle size (estimated by electrophoresis), sdLDL-C levels, and lipid profile were blindly assessed at baseline and 3 months.", 
    "210": "clinicaltrials.gov NCT00932620.", 
    "211": "Both simvastatin 40\u2009mg and simvastatin/ezetimibe 10/10\u2009mg decreased total cholesterol (-31% and -36%, respectively), LDL-C (-43% and -49%, respectively), triglycerides (-17% and -19%, respectively), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C; -40% and -46%, respectively), large LDL-C (-40 and -44%, respectively) and sdLDL-C levels (-42% and -46%, respectively, all p\u2009<\u20090.000 vs baseline) and increased LDL particle size (+0.5% and +0.7%, respectively, both p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs baseline). The changes in total cholesterol, LDL-C and non-HDL-C were greater in the simvastatin/ezetimibe group (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). Changes in triglycerides, large LDL-C, sdLDL-C levels and LDL particle size were similar in the two groups. In multivariate analysis, baseline sdLDL-C and triglyceride levels, but not the choice of treatment, were significantly and independently correlated with the changes in sdLDL-C levels.", 
    "212": "The combination of simvastatin 10\u2009mg plus ezetimibe 10\u2009mg is similarly effective to simvastatin 40\u2009mg in improving sdLDL-C concentration and LDL particle size in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia."
