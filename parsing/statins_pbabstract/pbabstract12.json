    "1": "This is a substudy of the J-STARS, a multicenter, randomized, open-label, blinded-end point, parallel-group trial to examine whether pravastatin reduces stroke recurrence in patients with noncardioembolic stroke. The patients are randomized to receive pravastatin (10\u2009mg daily) or not to receive any statins. Carotid ultrasonography is performed by well-trained certified examiners in each participating institute, and the recorded data are measured centrally.

Exome sequencing and electronic health record (EHR) data of 50,726 individuals were used to assess the prevalence and clinical impact of FH-associated genomic variants in the Geisinger Health System. The estimated FH prevalence was 1:256 in unselected participants and 1:118 in participants ascertained via the cardiac catheterization laboratory. FH variant carriers had significantly increased risk of coronary artery disease. Only 24% of carriers met EHR-based presequencing criteria for probable or definite FH diagnosis. Active statin use was identified in 58% of carriers; 46% of statin-treated carriers had a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level below 100 mg/dl. Thus, we find that genomic screening can prompt the diagnosis of FH patients, most of whom are receiving inadequate lipid-lowering therapy.",

These core-shell nanoparticles comprising an AT-loaded negatively charged poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) core and a cationic lipid bilayer shell were prepared by nanoprecipitation method followed by thin film hydration and extrusion. The nanoparticles were further functionalized with apoA-I and DXS via sodium cholate mediation and electrostatic interaction, respectively. The core-shell structure and the surface coating of apoA-I and DXS were verified by the increased particle size, inverted zeta potential, and reduced in vitro drug release rate. The TEM image further confirmed the entrapment of the PLGA nanoparticles in the aqueous interior of the liposomes. In vitro cell viability assay showed the biocompatibility of the AT-loaded nanocarriers. The cellular uptake study illustrated that the targeting efficacy to macrophages increased in the following order: PLGA nanoparticles (P-NP), core-shell nanoparticles (LP-NP), core-shell rHDL (LP-rHDL), and DXS-LP-rHDL. Moreover, cellular drug efficacy of AT-loaded nanoparticles in preventing macrophage-derived foam cell formation and inflammation such as intracellular lipid deposition, cholesterol esters content, DiI-oxLDL uptake, cholesterol efflux, and secretion of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10 was much better than that of the drug-free nanoparticles, consistent with the results of cellular uptake study. Collectively, AT-DXS-LP-rHDL, as multifunctional carriers, could not only deliver more drug to macrophages, but also present antiatherogenic actions of the biofunctional nanocarriers through damping oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL) uptake and promoting cholesterol efflux.",

However, the increased risk for developing diabetes during extended stain use and the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. The objective of this study was to elucidate the signaling pathway and biological function between necrosis and autophagy induced by atorvastatin (AS) and pravastatin (PS). Here we observed that atorvastatin (AS) can increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce necrotic cell death and autophagy in NIT-1 cells, whereas pravastatin (PS) does not cause ROS and cell death but also induces autophagy. PARP1 exhibited a dual role in modulating necrosis and autophagy in AS- and PS-treated NIT-1 cells through RIP1-RIP3-MLKL pathway and PARP1-AMPK-mTOR pathway. Lastly, AS treatment induced mitochondrial morphology injury significantly more than PS treatment did. Thus, the PARP1 activation should be considered in the development of effective statin therapies for diabetes. Future studies may examine specific mechanisms and pathways in mitochondria, autophagy, and oxidative stress in vivo.",

Their efficacy in cardiovascular risk reduction is well established and indications for their use are expanding. While statins are generally well tolerated and safe, adverse events are relatively common, particularly statin-associated muscle adverse events (SaMAEs), which are the most frequently encountered type of adverse event. Recent guidelines and guideline updates on SaMAEs and statin intolerance have included revised definitions of SaMAEs, incorporating new evidence on their pathogenesis and management. As SaMAEs emerge as a therapeutic challenge, it is important for physicians to be aware of updates on management strategies to ensure better patient outcomes. The majority of patients who are considered statin-intolerant can nevertheless tolerate some forms of statin therapy and successfully achieve optimal LDL-C levels. This review article discusses the recent classification of SaMAEs with emphasis on pathogenesis and management strategies.",

This association is multifactorial, but CKD is often associated with dyslipidemia, which likely contributes. Patients with CKD have dyslipidemia even at early stages of renal dysfunction and dyslipidemia tends to progress with deterioration of kidney function. The dyslipidemia in CKD is largely due to increased triglyceride levels, decreased HDL-C and varying levels of LDL-C. Current management of CKD may also affect lipid levels. Robust clinical trials demonstrate that statins are safe and efficacious in both lipid lowering and prevention of CVD events in pre-end stage CKD and post-transplant. However, there is no evidence of improved CVD outcomes with statin use in dialysis patients. This review will focus on mechanisms underlying dyslipidemia in CKD and clinical trial evidence for lipid lowering therapy in patients with CKD.", 
    "44": "Purpose To identify factors related to who undergoes a prostate biopsy in a screened population and to estimate the impact of biopsy verification on risk factor-prostate cancer associations. Patients and Methods Men who were screened regularly from the placebo arms of two large prostate cancer prevention trials (Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial [PCPT] and Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial [SELECT]) were examined to define incident prostate cancer cohorts. Because PCPT had an end-of-study biopsy, prostate cancer cases were categorized by a preceding prostate-specific antigen/digital rectal examination prompt (yes/no) and noncases by biopsy-proven negative status (yes v no). We estimated the association of risk factors (age, ethnicity, family history, body mass index, medication use) with prostate cancer and quantified differences in risk associations across cohorts. Results Men 60 to 69 years of age, those with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and those with a family history of prostate cancer were more likely, and those with a higher body mass index (\u2265 25), diabetes, or a smoking history were less likely, to undergo biopsy, adjusting for age and longitudinal prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal examination. Medication use, education, and marital status also influenced who underwent biopsy. Some risk factor estimates for prostate cancer varied substantially across cohorts. Black ( v other ethnicities) had odds ratios (ORs) that varied from 1.20 for SELECT (community screening standards, epidemiologic-like cohort) to 1.83 for PCPT (end-of-study biopsy supplemented with imputed end points). Statin use in SELECT provided an OR of 0.65 and statin use in in PCPT provided an OR of 0.99, a relative difference of 34%. Conclusion Among screened men enrolled in prostate cancer prevention trials, differences in risk factor estimates for prostate cancer likely underestimate the magnitude of bias found in other cohorts with varying screening and biopsy recommendations and acceptance. Risk factors for prostate cancer derived from epidemiologic studies not only may be erroneous but may lead to misdirected research efforts.", 
    "45": "Podocytes form the essential components of the glomerular filtration barrier and play a critical role in diabetic nephropathy. Recent evidence suggests that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) exert renoprotective effects. We investigated whether pitavastatin directly suppresses hyperglycaemia-induced podocyte injury using cultured podocytes and, if so, the mechanism of the beneficial effects. Cultured podocytes were exposed to media containing normal (NG; 5\u00a0mmol/L) or high (HG; 25\u00a0mmol/L) glucose for 1\u00a0week. HG increased the lethal injury of podocytes and disruption of F-actin fibers, and reduced the mRNA expression of novel podocyte markers, synaptopodin and Wilms tumor-1 (WT-1), in association with decreased bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) expression. Pitavastatin (100\u00a0nmol/L) reduced podocyte injury and restored the mRNA expression of synaptopodin and WT1; however, these protective effects were abolished by BMP-7 siRNA. Additionally, pitavastatin suppressed HG-induced Rho kinase activation, as assessed by the phosphorylation level of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYTP1), and C3 exotoxin, a Rho inhibitor, mimicked the effect of pitavastatin on BMP-7 preservation. Pitavastatin attenuates hyperglycaemia-induced podocyte injury via Rho-Rho kinase-dependent BMP-7 preservation.",

The particles showed a relatively fast release of simvastatin in vitro (35.6%\u00b14.2% in 6 hours) in simulated nasal fluid. Blank nanoparticles did not show cytotoxicity, evidencing that the formulation is safe for nasal administration, while cytotoxicity of simvastatin-loaded nanoparticles (IC50) was found to be three times lower than the drug solution (9.92 vs 3.50 \u03bcM). In rats, a significantly higher radioactivity was evidenced in the brain after nasal delivery of simvastatin-loaded nanoparticles in comparison to the administration of a similar dose of simvastatin suspension.",

This indicates a new Trojan-horse strategy which may enhance drug release in the proximity of the nasal mucosa. Second was their ability to enhance the nose-to-brain transport as evidenced by preliminary gamma scintigraphy studies.",

We randomized 207 patients, age 45-65\u2005years, at intermediate CHD risk, and not on statins, to receive the 10-year risk of CHD based on conventional risk factors alone (n=103) or in combination with a genetic risk score (n=104). A genetic counselor disclosed this information followed by a physician visit for SDM regarding statin therapy. A novel decision aid was used in both encounters to disclose the CHD risk estimates and facilitate SDM regarding statin use. Patients reported their decision quality and physician visit satisfaction using validated surveys. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the SDM score, satisfaction with the clinical encounter, perception of the quality of the discussion or of participation in decision-making and physician visit satisfaction scores. Quantitative analyses of a random subset of 80 video-recorded encounters using the OPTION5 scale also showed no significant difference in SDM between the two groups.

    "58": "Inflammation plays a pivotal role throughout the formation and progression of atherosclerosis. As the most representative inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP) directly participates in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. The elevated homocysteine (Hcy) level in plasma is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. We previously reported that Hcy produces a pro-inflammatory effect by stimulating CRP expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The present study observed the effect of simvastatin on Hcy-induced CRP expression in VSMCs and the molecular mechanisms. The in vitro experiments revealed that pretreatment of VSMCs with simvastatin decreased Hcy-induced mRNA and protein expression of CRP in a concentration-dependent fashion. The in vivo results showed that simvastatin not only inhibited CRP expression in the vessel walls in mRNA and protein levels, but also reduced the circulating CRP level in hyperhomocysteinemic rats. Further experiments displayed that simvastatin reduced Hcy-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, ameliorated Hcy-activated phosphorylations of ERK1/2 and p38, and antagonized Hcy-downregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression in VSMCs. These data demonstrate that simvastatin is able to inhibit Hcy-induced CRP generation in VSMCs so to relieve the vascular inflammatory response via interfering with the ROS-MAPK signal pathway. The present results provide new evidence for understanding of the potential anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic effects of simvastatin. As the high level of Hcy in plasma is related to atherosclerosis formation and mediates cardiovascular risk, our findings emphasize the importance and necessity of therapy with statins for hyperhomocysteinemia in atherosclerosis.",

Statins have been suggested to reduce the risk of several cancers beyond their cholesterol-lowing effects.

A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the association between statin intake and overall survival (OS) among patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. Patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by courses of intravenous chemotherapy were matched through a propensity score analysis. Results. A total of 60 propensity-matched patients were included. Women in statin group showed a similar OS than the nonstatin counterparts (P = 0.966), whereas residual tumor was significantly associated with better OS (P = 0.013) and was an independent factor that associated with OS (P = 0.002, hazard ratio = 5.460, and 95% confidence interval: 1.894 to 15.742) in multivariable analysis.

    "114": "Homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HoFH) is an inherited disease causing an approximately fourfold increase in blood low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) from birth compared with the age-matched normal population owing to reduced low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) activity. Such elevated cholesterol is associated with accelerated atheromatous disease, particularly of the aortic root and coronary arteries. However, HoFH is clinically heterogeneous, reflecting residual low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) activity. The main objective in treating children may be stated to be the avoidance of irreversible cardiac damage requiring heart transplantation by sufficient lowering of blood cholesterol. Lipoprotein apheresis or plasmapheresis are safe means of lowering cholesterol but may be insufficient on their own. Statin drugs, PCSK9 inhibitors ezetimibe and bile acid sequestrants are relatively ineffective if LDLR activity is lacking, but should be used if effective. Two new drugs, lomitapide and mipomersen, have been licensed specifically for HoFH by some regulatory authorities. They work by reducing LDL production rate. They have been associated with fatty liver in adults. Evidence of safety in children is lacking. An alternative is liver transplantation, which replaces the missing LDLR and normalises cholesterol. Clinicians are faced with a dilemma in choosing between these options or deferring such treatment associated with potential harm. Individual case descriptions are an important means of informing clinical judgement. Management of the two cases described in this issue is discussed in the light of modern developments in transplantation and pharmacotherapy.",

The six positive controls identified were amiodarone (repeated twice), frusemide, simvastatin, lithium and fluticasone. Amiodarone and lithium have been reported to induce thyroid dysfunction. Simvastatin reported to cause muscle cramps while fluticasone is well documented to cause oral candidiasis. Thyroxine was identified as a marker drug to treat hypothyroidism associated with amiodarone and lithium. Carbimazole was identified as a marker drug to treat hyperthyroidism associated with amiodarone use. Quinine sulphate was identified as a marker drug to treat muscle cramps associated with statins. In addition, we also analysed six negative controls that are unlikely to be associated with ADRs. The main outcome measure is to determine associations with ADRs using adjusted sequence ratios (ASR), and 95% confidence intervals RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our analyses confirmed a significant signal for all six positive controls. Significant positive associations were noted for amiodarone [ASR = 3\u00b757, 95% CI (3\u00b717-4\u00b702)], and lithium chloride induced hypothyroidism [ASR = 3\u00b743, 95% CI (2\u00b755-4\u00b770)]. Amiodarone was also strongly associated with hyperthyroidism [ASR = 8\u00b781 95% CI (5\u00b786-13\u00b777)]. Simvastatin was associated with muscle cramps [ASR = 1\u00b769, 95% CI (1\u00b761-1\u00b777)]. Fluticasone was positively associated with oral candidiasis [ASR = 2\u00b734, 95% CI (2\u00b719-2\u00b750)]. Frusemide was associated with hypokalaemia [ASR = 2\u00b794, 95% CI (2\u00b783-3\u00b705]). No strong associations were noted for the negative pairs.

A side effect of lovastatin is inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis and cell membrane formation in methanogenic Archaea, which are members of the human digestive tract microbiota and are emerging pathogens. In this study, the in vitro susceptibility of the human-associated methanogens Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter oralis, Methanobrevibacter massiliense, Methanobrevibacter arboriphilus and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis to lovastatin (1-4\u2009\u00b5g/mL) was tested in the presence of five gut anaerobes aiming to metabolise lovastatin into \u03b2-hydroxy acid lovastatin as confirmed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. Five days of incubation with lovastatin had no measurable effect on the growth of the five gut anaerobes but significantly reduced CH4 production and methanogen growth as measured by quantitative PCR (P\u2009<0.01). Quantitative PCR analyses indicated that compared with controls, \u03b2-hydroxy acid lovastatin significantly increased the expression of the genes mta and mcrA implicated in methanogenesis and significantly decreased the expression of the fno gene implicated in methanogenesis. Expression of the HMGR gene (hmg) implicated in cell wall synthesis was significantly increased by \u03b2-hydroxy acid lovastatin (P\u2009<0.01). These results strongly suggest that in the presence of gut anaerobes, lovastatin yields \u03b2-hydroxy acid lovastatin, which inhibits methane production and growth of methanogens by affecting their cell membrane biosynthesis. Lovastatin is the first licensed drug to exclusively affect the growth of methanogens whilst protecting the bacterial microbiota.",

The study was performed in a population-based cohort of 1016 elderly individuals, which comprised 168 statin users investigated at age 75 and 80. Using random forest models, the major variants influencing LDL-C levels were summarized in a weighted GRS (wGRS).

These combinations may overcome some of the limitations of statin monotherapy by blocking both sources of cholesterol. Recently, a fixed-dose combination with atorvastatin, one of the most extensively studied statins, was approved and launched in several countries, including the USA. Depending on atorvastatin dose, this combination provides LDL-C reductions of 50-60%, triglyceride reductions of 30-40%, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increases of 5-9%. Studies comparing the lipid-lowering efficacy of the atorvastatin-ezetimibe combination with the alternatives of statin dose titration or switching to a more potent statin consistently showed that combination therapy provided greater LDL-C reduction, translating into a greater proportion of patients achieving lipid goals. Simvastatin-ezetimibe combinations have been shown to reduce the incidence of major atherosclerotic events in several clinical settings to a magnitude that seems similar to that observed with statins for the same degree of absolute LDL-C lowering. The atorvastatin-ezetimibe combination has also been shown to induce the regression of coronary atherosclerosis measured by intravascular ultrasound in a significantly greater proportion of patients than atorvastatin alone. Atorvastatin-ezetimibe combinations are generally well tolerated. Previous concerns of a possible increase in the incidence of cancer with ezetimibe were dismissed in large trials with long follow-up periods.

These drugs target (among other things) the endothelial dysfunction found in all of these diseases. Most scientists work on new drugs that target viruses, and few accept the idea of treating the host response with generic drugs. A great deal of research will be needed to show conclusively that these drugs work, and this will require the support of public agencies and foundations. Investigators in developing countries should take an active role in this research. If the next Public Health Emergency of International Concern is caused by an emerging virus, a \"top down\" approach to developing specific new drug treatments is unlikely to be effective. However, a \"bottom up\" approach to treatment that targets the host response to these viruses by using widely available and inexpensive generic drugs could reduce mortality in any country with a basic health care system.

Supplementation with 10mg/kg body weight/day of atorvastatin for 17 weeks significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Atorvastatin alone caused a subtle change in fatty acid composition particularly of EPA and DHA in the plasma, liver or erythrocyte membranes. However, the TAK-085 consistently increased both the levels of EPA and DHA in the plasma, liver and erythrocyte membranes. After confirming the reduction of plasma total cholesterol, 300mg/kg body weight/day of TAK-085 was continuously administered for another 6 weeks. Supplementation with TAK-085 did not decrease plasma total cholesterol but significantly increased the EPA and DHA levels in both the plasma and liver compared with rats administered atorvastatin only. Supplementation with atorvastatin alone significantly decreased sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, \u03945- and \u03946-desaturases, elongase-5, and stearoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) desaturase-2 levels and increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase mRNA expression in the liver compared with control rats. TAK-085 supplementation significantly increased stearoyl-CoA desaturase-2 mRNA expression. These results suggest that long-term supplementation with atorvastatin decreases the EPA and DHA levels by inhibiting the desaturation and elongation of n-3 fatty acid metabolism, while TAK-085 supplementation effectively replenishes this effect in SHRcp rat liver.",

In general, the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP; SLCO) represent a superfamily of uptake transporters that mediate the sodium-independent transport of a diverse range of amphipathic organic compounds including bile salts, steroid conjugates, thyroid hormones, anionic peptides, numerous drugs and other xenobiotic substances. OATP1B1 is highly polymorphic and a number of relevant and ethnically dependent polymorphisms have been identified and functionally characterized. In particular, the SLCO1B1 521T>C and 388A>G polymorphisms are commonly occurring variants in ethnically diverse populations and numerous in vitro and clinical studies have evaluated the consequences of these variants to interindividual differences in drug disposition and response. OATP1B1 is particularly important for the disposition of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, as it is known to efficiently transport most statins to their site of action within hepatocytes. Many studies have focused on the consequences of OATP1B1 variants to statin disposition in vitro and in vivo and would suggest that genetic variability in SLCO1B1 has important implications for statin pharmacokinetics, risk for statin-induced myopathy, and modulation of statin treatment response. This review describes what is currently known regarding SLCO1B1 genotype, OATP1B1 protein expression and interindividual and interethnic consequences to drug disposition, with particular focus on statin pharmacokinetics and implications for drug response and toxicity.",

Hypercholesterolemia and training status are factors that are rarely considered in the progression of myopathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which acute and chronic exercise can influence statin-induced myopathy in hypercholesterolemic (ApoE-/-) mice. Mice either received daily injections of saline or simvastatin (20 mg/kg) while: 1) remaining sedentary (Sed), 2) engaging in daily exercise for two weeks (novel, Nov), or 3) engaging in daily exercise for two weeks after a brief period of training (accustomed, Acct) (2x3 design, n = 60). Cholesterol, activity, strength, and indices of myofiber damage and atrophy were assessed. Running wheel activity declined in both exercise groups receiving statins (statin x time interaction, p<0.05). Cholesterol, grip strength, and maximal isometric force were significantly lower in all groups following statin treatment (statin main effect, p<0.05). Mitochondrial content and myofiber size were increased and 4-HNE was decreased by exercise (statin x exercise interaction, p<0.05), and these beneficial effects were abrogated by statin treatment. Exercise (Acct and Nov) increased atrogin-1 mRNA in combination with statin treatment, yet enhanced fiber damage or atrophy was not observed. The results from this study suggest that exercise (Nov, Acct) does not exacerbate statin-induced myopathy in ApoE-/- mice, yet statin treatment reduces activity in a manner that prevents muscle from mounting a beneficial adaptive response to training.",

    "190": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal codominantly inherited disease. The severity of clinical presentation depends on the zygosity of the mutations in the LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 genes. The homozygous form (HoFH) is associated with high mortality rate by third decade of life, while individuals with HeFH begin to suffer from premature cardiovascular disease in fourth or fifth decade of life. Statin drugs have helped to improve the biochemical profile and life expectancy in HeFH, while they are only minimally effective in HoFH. LDL apheresis remains an effective treatment option in HoFH, though limited by its availability and affordability issues. We present the case that highlights a few novel aspects of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in FH, wherein a child presented with features of both HeFH and HoFH. His clinical picture was that of HoFH; however he responded well clinically and biochemically to pharmacologic treatment only. DNA sequencing showed a novel heterozygous rare splicing variant in the LDLR gene in addition to a relatively high polygenic trait score comprised of LDL-C raising alleles from common polymorphic sites. Interestingly his normolipemic mother showed the same heterozygous mutation. Thus this novel splicing variant in LDLR showed nonclassical co-segregation with the disease phenotype and was associated with a high polygenic trait score comprised of common LDL-C raising polymorphic alleles in the affected proband. Thus it indicates the phenotypic heterogeneity of FH and suggests that secondary causes, such as polygenic factors and possibly as yet undetermined genetic or environmental factors, can exacerbate the metabolic phenotype in an individual who is genotypically heterozygous for FH.",

The signaling effects of LDLs were not seen in normal lymphocytes or glycolytic lymphoma cell-lines but were restored by transduction with the nuclear receptor PPAR\u03b4, which mediates metabolic activity in CLL cells. Breakdown of LDLs in lysosomes was required for the amplification effect, which correlated with down-regulation of HMGCR expression and long lymphocyte doubling times (LDTs) of 53.6\u00b110.4months. Cholesterol content of circulating CLL cells correlated directly with blood LDL levels in a subgroup of patients.

In the non-MI/CAD subjects, both TC > 250\u00a0mg/dL and < 150\u00a0mg/dL were associated with increased risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.27; 1.17-1.37 and 1.14; 1.11-1.18) compared to the reference (TC: 150-200\u00a0mg/dL). In the MI/CAD patients, only TC < 150\u00a0mg/dL had increased risk (HR; 95% CI: 1.15; 1.08-1.24). In addition, patients of the non-MI/CAD group with highest level of TC (>250\u00a0mg/dL) in both first and third year of dialysis had a 64% increased risk for mortality (HR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.51-1.80).",

The guideline further suggested that the therapy choice be based on patient-clinician discussions of risks and benefits. Since low-density lipoprotein particle (LDL-P) levels were reported to be associated with CVD independently of traditional risk factors in intermediate and low risk patients, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of using LDL-P levels to identify intermediate risk patients likely to benefit from initiating or intensifying statin therapy.", 
    "209": "We evaluated 5 care strategies for intermediate risk patients. These included the strategies suggested by the guideline: no-statin therapy and MST. We compared each of these strategies to a related strategy that incorporated LDL-P testing. No-statin therapy was compared with the strategy of MST for those with high LDL-P levels and no statin therapy for all other patients (test-and-MST). MST was compared with the strategy of high-intensity statin therapy (HST) for those with high LDL-P levels and MST for all other patients (test-and-HST). We also evaluated the strategy of HST for all. Costs (payer perspective) and utilities were assessed over a 5-year time horizon in a Markov model of 100,000 hypothetical intermediate\u00a0risk patients.", 
    "210": "HST dominated all other strategies, costing less and-despite causing 739 more cases of diabetes than did MST-resulting in more quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). For patient-clinician discussions that would otherwise lead to the MST strategy, we found the test-and-HST strategy reduced costs by $4.67 MM and resulted in 134 fewer CVD events and 115 additional QALYs. For patient-clinician discussions that would otherwise lead to no statin therapy, we found that the test-and-MST strategy reduced costs by $3.25 MM, resulted in 97 fewer CVD events and 44 additional QALYs.",

    "212": "Cardiovascular (CV) atherosclerotic disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the advances in contemporary therapies. Inflammation is an important process in atherosclerosis, leading to plaque rupture and acute coronary syndrome. Although statin therapy has substantially reduced CV events in primary and secondary prevention, many treated patients will have recurrent adverse CV events despite the standard of care. Thus, drug development aiming to target inflammatory pathways seems a promising avenue for novel therapies in atherosclerosis. Areas covered: Statins have been extensively studied and are the most effective lipid-lowering drugs available for CV prevention. Novel anti-inflammatory drugs are being tested in Phase II and III trials, targeting pathways like interleukin-1, leukotrienes, TNF-\u03b1, P-selectin, CCL2-CCR2 and MAP Kinase. Expert opinion: Novel anti-inflammatory therapies seem promising additions to address the residual CV risk present despite the current standard of care, but large clinical trials have not yet shown beneficial effects on clinical events. PCSK9 inhibitors have been shown to substantially reduce LDL-C, however their long-term safety and effects on CV risk are currently being investigated. Pharmacogenomics holds great potential in future lipid trials, enabling the identification of patients who will respond with greater benefits and smaller risk to therapies and to decrease failure rates in drug development, as genotype-dependent effects of the CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib were shown in the dal-OUTCOMES and dal-PLAQUE-2 trials.", 
    "213": "Simvastatin is a common medication prescribed for hypercholesterolemia that accelerates local bone formation. It is unclear whether simvastatin can accelerate healing at the tendon-bone interface after rotator cuff repair. This study was conducted to investigate whether local and systemic administration of simvastatin increased tendon-bone healing of the rotator cuff as detected by maximum load to failure in a controlled animal-based model. Supraspinatus tendon repair was performed on 120 Sprague-Dawley rats. Sixty rats had a polylactic acid membrane overlying the repair site. Of these, 30 contained simvastatin and 30 did not contain medication. Sixty rats underwent repair without a polylactic acid membrane. Of these, 30 received oral simvastatin (25 mg/kg/d) and 30 received a regular diet. At 4 weeks, 5 rats from each group were killed for histologic analysis. At 8 weeks, 5 rats from each group were killed for histologic analysis and the remaining 20 rats were killed for biomechanical analysis. One rat that received oral simvastatin died of muscle necrosis. Average maximum load to failure was 35.2\u00b16.2 N for those receiving oral simvastatin, 36.8\u00b19.0 N for oral control subjects, 39.5\u00b112.8 N for those receiving local simvastatin, and 39.1\u00b19.3 N for control subjects with a polylactic acid membrane. No statistically significant differences were found between any of the 4 groups (P>.05). Qualitative histologic findings showed that all groups showed increased collagen formation and organization at 8 weeks compared with 4 weeks, with no differences between the 4 groups at each time point. The use of systemic and local simvastatin offered no benefit over control groups. [Orthopedics. 2017; 40(2):e288-e292.].", 
    "214": "ROR\u03b1 is a member of nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, which has a vital role in the regulation of various physiological processes. Cholesterol is a known ligand of ROR\u03b1 and is one of the key components that take part in cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is possible that ROR\u03b1 might have a role in the development of atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the presence of novel ROR\u03b1 response elements (ROREs) located in the promoter of CYP19A1, MIF and ABCA1 genes. Briefly, the occupancy of ROR\u03b1 in the promoter regions of these genes was demonstrated in THP-1 and HUVEC cell lines by ChIP analysis. In order to modulate ROR\u03b1 activity, THP-1 and HUVEC cells were treated with specific ROR\u03b1 ligands (CPG 52608 and SR1001) and then the expression levels of target genes were analysed. In the next step, we tested whether ROR\u03b1 activity in THP-1 macrophages was influenced by the presence of simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering drug. We found that in the presence of simvastatin the expression of the investigated target genes were down regulated and that this regulation was partially prevented by CPG 52608 and SR1001. Results of this study suggest that CYP19A1, MIF and ABCA1 are the direct target genes of ROR\u03b1. In conclusion, it is important to demonstrate that certain genes involved in the development of atherosclerosis could be modulated by an inducible transcription factor. Therefore, these results offer a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of atherosclerosis.",

Sebastiano Hospital (Caserta, Italy) and to the OLV Clinic (Aalst, Belgium), between March 2009 and December 2011, were retrospectively enrolled. Rescue PCI was the only exclusion criterion. Primary end-point was the combination of death for all causes, re-infarction, stroke, and target lesion revascularization (TLR). Patients already on DAPT at admission (26.4%) showed a significant increase in the event rate at univariate analysis (HR 2.34, CI 1.62-3.75, P\u2009<\u20090.05), while current smokers (56.5%) had a lower event rate, as compared to non-smokers (HR 0.67, CI 0.46-0.96, P\u2009<\u20090.05). In smoking patients already on DAPT at admission, a lower event rate was observed than in non-smoking patients on DAPT. Although, patients already on DAPT had a higher-risk profile (renal impairment, ongoing statin treatment, ST resolution <50%, and Killip class >1 were more frequently present than in patients not on DAPT), Cox regression analysis confirmed that both DAPT (HR 1.74, 95%CI 1.20-2.53, P\u2009<\u20090.01) and smoking status (HR 0.69, 95%CI 0.48-1.00, P\u2009<\u20090.05) retained their statistical significance, as they and were significantly associated with a worse and a better outcome, respectively, underlying their role as independent prognostic factors.",

Cardiovascular disease-related miRNAs, CTGF, and EndoMT markers were quantified using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, and Western blotting. Compared with healthy controls, human umbilical vein endothelial cell incubated with sera from acute KD patients had decreased miR-483, increased CTGF, and increased EndoMT markers. Bioinformatics analysis followed by functional validation demonstrated that Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) transactivates miR-483, which in turn targets the 3' untranslated region of CTGF mRNA. Overexpression of KLF4 or pre-miR-483 suppressed, whereas knockdown of KLF4 or anti-miR-483 enhanced, CTGF expression in endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, atorvastatin, currently being tested in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in KD children, induced KLF4-miR-483, which suppressed CTGF and EndoMT in endothelial cells.",

    "223": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by severely elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels that lead to atherosclerotic plaque deposition in the coronary arteries and proximal aorta at an early age, leading to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Xanthomas (patches of yellowish cholesterol buildup) may worsen with age as a result of extremely high cholesterol levels. Xanthomas can occur around the eyelids and within the tendons of the elbows, hands, knees, and feet. In FH, the more common cardiovascular disease is coronary artery disease (CAD), which may manifest as angina and myocardial infarction; stroke occurs more rarely. Untreated men are at a 50% risk for a fatal or non-fatal coronary event by age 50 years; untreated women are at a 30% risk by age 60 years. An estimated 70%-95% of FH results from a heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of three genes (APOB, LDLR, PCSK9). FH is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease, with a prevalence of 1:200-250. FH likely accounts for 2%-3% of myocardial infarctions in individuals younger than age 60 years. In contrast, homozygous FH (HoFH) results from biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) pathogenic variants in one of these known genes (APOB, LDLR, PCSK9). Most individuals with HoFH experience severe CAD by their mid-20s and the rate of either death or coronary bypass surgery by the teenage years is high. Severe aortic stenosis is also common.", 
    "224": "Several formal diagnostic criteria exist for FH. The diagnostic criteria most widely used in Western countries include: extreme hypercholesterolemia (untreated adults with LDL-C>190 mg/dL or total cholesterol levels >310 mg/dL; untreated children/adolescents with LDL-C levels >160 mg/dL or total cholesterol levels >230 mg/dL); history of premature CAD or other CVD; xanthomas; corneal arcus; and a family history of features suggestive of FH. The diagnosis of FH can also be established by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in one of the three genes (APOB, LDLR, and PCSK9) known to be associated with FH. The diagnosis of HoFH can be established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the three genes (APOB, LDLR, and PCSK9) known to be associated with FH.", 
    "225": "Treatment of manifestations: Adults with FH: reduce CAD risk factors including cessation of smoking, regular physical activity, healthy diet and weight control; treatment of hypertension; low-dose aspirin in high-risk individuals; pharmacotherapy (statins with additional medications as needed) to reduce lipid levels; referral to a lipid specialist if necessary to reduce LDL-C levels. Children with FH: referral to a lipid specialist; diet and lifestyle modifications; statins can be used in children starting around age eight years. Children and adults with HoFH: referral to a lipid specialist or specialized center for management of multiple drug therapy; LDL apheresis is often required; liver transplantation in rare circumstances. Prevention of primary manifestations: Statin-based therapy with addition of other medications as needed, in combination with a heart-healthy diet (including reduced intake of saturated fat and increased intake of soluble fiber to 10-20 g/day); increased physical activity; not smoking. Surveillance: Children with an established diagnosis of FH or risk factors for FH (e.g., elevated serum cholesterol, a family history of FH, a family history of premature CAD or other CVD) should have lipid levels checked before age ten years. All individuals with FH should have lipid levels monitored as recommended. Individuals with HoFH should be monitored with various imaging modalities (including echocardiograms, CT angiograms and cardiac catheterization) as recommended. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Smoking, high intake of saturated and trans unsaturated fat, excessive intake of cholesterol, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Early diagnosis and treatment of first-degree and second-degree relatives at risk for FH can reduce morbidity and mortality. The genetic status of at-risk family members can be clarified by either: (1) molecular genetic testing if the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member; or (2) measurement of LDL-C concentration. Pregnancy management: Pregnant women should incorporate all the recommended lifestyle changes including low-saturated fat intake, no smoking, and high dietary soluble fiber. Statins are contraindicated in pregnancy due to concerns for teratogenicity and should be discontinued prior to conception. Bile acid binding resins (e.g., colesevelam) are generally considered safe (Class B for pregnancy), and LDL apheresis is also occasionally used if there is evidence of established CAD.", 
    "226": "Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Almost all individuals diagnosed with FH have an affected parent; the proportion of FH caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown but appears to be extremely low. Each child of an individual with FH has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. If both parents have FH, each child has a 50% chance of having FH, a 25% chance of having HoFH, and a 25% chance of not having FH. If the pathogenic variant has been identified in a family member with FH (or if both pathogenic variants have been identified in a family member with HoFH), prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible.",

Recently proposed mechanisms of injury in patients with critical illness myopathy include inhibition of protein synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, oxidative stress, and disruption of intramuscular calcium homeostasis, which can cause a myosin-loss myopathy. Mechanisms underlying toxic myopathies include myosin loss; damage to cellular structures, including myofibrils and organelles such as lysosomes and mitochondria; inflammation; and necrosis.

The present review focuses on the evidence supporting an even wider utilization of statins in intensive care practice for diverse indications. A search of the literature was carried out in PubMed, Cochrane and EMBASE databases up to January 2016. Review articles, meta-analyses, and original trials on the effects of statin therapy in the intensive care unit (ICU) were included, by combining the following MeSH terms: \"statins,\" \"intensive care,\" \"cardiac surgery,\" \"sepsis,\" \"acute respiratory distress syndrome,\" \"pneumonia,\" \"subarachnoid hemorrhage,\" \"traumatic brain injury,\" and \"critical illness.\" Case reports were excluded. No language restriction was applied. References were also searched for other potentially useful articles. It was concluded that beneficial effects of statins are observed in cardiac surgery; however, no robust evidence supports their effectiveness in diverse critical care settings. The decision to discontinue statins in native users should be taken in consideration of particular clinical circumstances."
