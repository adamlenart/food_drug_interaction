    "0": "The mevalonate pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis and protein prenylation has been implicated in various aspects of tumor development and progression. Certain classes of drugs, such as statins and bisphosphonates, inhibit mevalonate metabolism and therefore have also been tested as antitumor agents. This concept is strongly supported by the recent finding that mutant p53, which is present in more than half of all human cancers, can significantly upregulate mevalonate metabolism and protein prenylation in carcinoma cells. The first evidence that mevalonate pathway inhibitors may have the potential to reverse the malignant phenotype has already been obtained. Moreover, recently discovered immunomodulatory properties of statins and bisphosphonates may also contribute to their known anticancer effects. Drug-induced inhibition of protein prenylation may induce sequential cellular stress responses, including the unfolded protein response and autophagy, that eventually translate into inflammasome-dependent and caspase-1-mediated activation of innate immunity. This review focuses on these novel capabilities of mevalonate pathway inhibitors to beneficially affect tumor biology and contribute to tumor immune surveillance.",

The CYP3A4 statins (i.e., simvastatin, atorvastatin and lovastatin) accounted for 85% of all statins in 2004, increasing to 93% in 2008. There was no significant difference in the likelihood of being prescribed a CYP3A4 statin versus a non-CYP3A4 statin among patients receiving EIAEDs and NEIAEDs. The average daily dose of individual CYP3A4 statins was not different between the AED groups.",

    "9": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder caused by mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene. FH is characterized by elevated plasma LDL cholesterol, premature atherosclerosis, and a high risk of premature myocardial infarction. In general, mutations within LDLR gene can cause five different classes of defects, namely: class I defect: no LDLR synthesis; class II defect: no LDLR transport; class III defect: no low density lipoprotein (LDL) to LDLR binding; class IV defect: no LDLR/LDL internalization; and class V defect: no LDLR recycling. One might expect that both the class of LDLR defect as well as the precise mutation influences the severity of hypercholesterolemia on one hand and the response on drug treatment on the other. To clarify this question we studied the effect of the LDLR mutation p.W556R in two heterozygote subjects.", 
    "10": "We found that two heterozygote FH patients with the LDLR mutation p.W556R causing a class II LDLR defect (transport defective LDLR) respond exceedingly well to the treatment with simvastatin 40 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg. There was a LDL cholesterol decrease of 55 and 64%, respectively. In contrast, two affected homozygote p.W556R FH patients, in the mean time undergoing LDL apheresis, had no response to statin but a 15% LDL cholesterol decrease on ezetimibe monotherapy.", 
    "11": "The LDLR mutation p.W556R is a frequent and severe class II defect for FH. The affected homozygote FH patients have a total loss of the functional LDLR and-as expected-do not respond on statin therapy and require LDL apheresis. In contrast, heterozygote FH patients with the same LDLR defect respond exceedingly well to standard lipid-lowering therapy, illustrating that the knowledge of the primary LDLR defect enables us to foresee the expected drug effects.",

    "20": "Recent data suggest that atherosclerotic disease is increased in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) and that dyslipidemia is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular events. Lipid-lowering agents may be associated with myopathic side effects. The current work evaluates the use of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with IIM treated by IIM specialists belonging to the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies (IMACS) Group. The IMACS Group is a multidisciplinary coalition of experts with significant interest and experience in IIM. IMACS members were asked to complete an 18-item online survey detailing their clinical practice on monitoring and treating hypercholesterolemia in IIM patients. Specific questions regarding the types of lipid-lowering therapies used in IIM patients and any side effects associated with treatment were asked. Sixty-three IMACS members representing 23 countries and a minimum of 1,641 IIM patients participated in the online survey. Seventy-six percent of these specialists treating adult IIM patients use lipid-lowering therapies in their patients. HMG co-enzymeA reductase inhibitors (statins) were the most commonly used agents (93\u00a0%). Thirty-six cases of worsening myositis associated with statin use were reported in over 300 patients using lipid-lowering therapies. Seven of eight responders who reported worsening in myositis with lipid-lowering therapies reported cases in which the myositis improved after holding therapy. This survey suggests that statins are commonly used by physicians specializing in the treatment of patients with IIM and that some myositis patients worsen with statin use and may improve on dechallenge. More research regarding the safety of lipid-lowering agents in patients with IIM is warranted.", 
    "21": "Large scale clinical trials have undoubtedly demonstrated that statins are effective in reducing cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in almost all patient populations. Also the short and long-term safety of statin therapy has been well established in the majority of treated patients. Nevertheless, intolerance to statins must be frequently faced in the clinical practice. The most commonly observed adverse effects of statins are muscle symptoms and elevation of hepatic aminotransferase and creatinine kinase (CK) levels. Overall, myalgia (muscle pain with or without plasma CK elevations) and a single abnormally elevated liver function test constitute approximately two-thirds of reported adverse events during statin therapy. These side effects raise concerns in the patients and are likely to reduce patient's adherence and, consequently, the cardiovascular benefit. Therefore, it is mandatory that clinicians improve knowledge on the clinical aspects of side effects of statins and the ability to manage patients with intolerance to statins. Numerous different approaches to statin-intolerant patients have been suggested, but an evidence-based consensus is difficult to be reached due to the lack of controlled trials. Therefore, it might be useful to review protocols and procedures to control statin intolerance. The first step in managing intolerant patients is to determine whether the adverse events are indeed related to statin therapy. Then, the switching to another statin or lower dosage, the alternate dosing options and the use of non-statin compounds may be practical strategies. However, the cardiovascular benefit of these approaches has not been established, so that their use has to be employed after a careful clinical assessment of each patient.", 
    "22": "Hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid disorder associated to different, highly prevalent metabolic derangements like diabetes mellitus, the metabolic syndrome and obesity. The choice of treatment depends on the underlying pathogenesis and the consequences for atherosclerosis or pancreatitis. A family history, physical examination and analysis of the lipid profile including measurement of apolipoprotein B or non-HDL-C are necessary to establish the underlying primary or secondary cause. Due to physiological diurnal variations of triglycerides (TG), the time of measurement (fasting or postprandial) should be taken into account when evaluating TG values. Increased awareness arises concerning the impact of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia on the development of atherosclerosis. Hypertriglyceridemia is strongly associated to postprandial hyperlipidemia, remnant accumulation, increased small dense LDL concentrations, low HDL-C, increased oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, leukocyte activation and insulin resistance. All these factors are strongly linked to the development of atherosclerosis. Treatment should be aimed at reducing the secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, increasing intravascular lipolysis and reducing the number of circulating remnants. The main intervention is a change of lifestyle with decreased alcohol consumption, increased physical activity, dietary changes and, if applicable, adaptation of used medication. Fibrates, fish oil and nicotinic acid are the first choice of treatment in sporadic and familial hypertriglyceridemia to reduce the risk of pancreatitis, whereas high dose statins, sometimes in combination with fibrates, nicotinic acid, or fish oil capsules, are indicated for familial combined hyperlipidemia. Statins are necessary to reach low LDL-C concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and statin dosage should be increased when hypertriglyceridemia is present to reach secondary treatment targets for apolipoprotein B or non-HDL-C. Finally, family screening is mandatory to detect familial lipid disorders for early intervention in other family members.", 
    "23": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA reductase inhibitors, or statins, represent an important class of agents that improve clinical outcomes in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Aside from lowering total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, statins have important pleiotropic effects that include anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antithrombotic actions as well as mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells and modification of plaque cholesterol crystallization. These combined effects lead to atherosclerotic plaque stabilization that is both quantitative (slowing of plaque progression or plaque volume regression) as well as qualitative (reduced inflammation and amount of lipid rich necrotic plaque) in nature. Statins have been shown to reduce overall mortality when used for either primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in multiple randomized clinical trials, but such trials involve a large sample size, long treatment duration and enormous financial cost. Imaging of change in plaque burden by various means such as coronary angiography, intravascular and B mode ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging represents a means of measuring surrogate endpoints by directly assessing statin effects on plaque regression. Multiple imaging studies have demonstrated plaque stabilization or regression with statin treatment that paralleled improvement in lipid profile and clinical outcomes, although it is unlikely that imaging modalities can replace hard clinical outcomes in assessing treatment efficacy.", 
    "24": "Epidemiological data have suggested that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) prevent the progression of chronic kidney diseases (CKDs), whereas the precise mechanism explaining in vitro to in vivo is missing. This study is aimed at exploring a new mechanism of action by statins on renal fibrosis, a hallmark of CKD, using mouse renal fibrosis model in vivo and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing USAG-1 in vitro. C57/BL6 mice fed a 0.2% adenine-containing diet for 4 weeks developed renal dysfunction accompanied with severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Subsequent simvastatin (SIM) treatment (50\u2009mg/kg per day) for 2 weeks significantly suppressed fibrosis progression. We found that SIM enhanced bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7)-mediated anti-fibrotic signaling with the reduced expression of uterine sensitization-associated gene-1 (USAG-1), a BMP-7 antagonist produced by renal distal tubular epithelial cells. Therefore, MDCK cells were incubated with transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and showed increased expression of USAG-1 and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin; SIM significantly reduced them. SIM significantly increased E-cadherin expression. Gene knockdown experiments using MDCK suggested that homeobox protein Hox-A13 (HOXA13) played a suppressive role in the USAG-1 gene and thus SIM reduced USAG-1 by increasing HOXA13 expression. The data from our study demonstrate that SIM, one of statins, contributes to prevent the progression of renal fibrosis by upregulating BMP-7-mediated anti-fibrotic signaling and that one aspect of crucial efficacies is achieved by regulating HOXA13 and USAG-1. HOXA13-USAG-1 pathway is a newly identified mechanism in renal fibrosis and will be a new therapeutic target for preventing renal fibrosis progression in CKDs.", 
    "25": "To discuss the beneficial effects of statin treatment in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) and carotid artery disease.", 
    "26": "Evidence suggests that statins may reduce the progression (or even reverse the development) of carotid artery stenosis and AAAs. Statins also improve several indices (e.g. serum creatinine) and preserve renal function in ARAS. In patients with PAD, statins are associated with improved claudication distance and time, reduced cardiovascular events, and improved graft patency rates should these patients undergo surgery. Finally, statins are associated with improved perioperative and long-term morbidity and mortality rates in all vascular patients whether they undergo surgery or endovascular procedures.", 
    "27": "Routine statin treatment should be implemented for all vascular patients to ensure a reduced progression of their disease, as well as a reduction in cardiovascular events.", 
    "28": "Statins are relevant drugs involved in the reduction of cardiovascular events both in primary and secondary prevention. Related muscular side-effects are the most common cause of withdrawal and statins discontinuation could induce a negative rebound effect in terms of vascular events. Among factors in association with statins side-effects the combination with other drugs and the female sex are established conditions. However recent data suggest a specific genetic influence in intolerance development, at least for some statins. Indeed a genome-wide study in patients treated with simvastatin found an impressive association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within SLCO1B1 gene on chromosome 12 and established myopathy. Furthermore, the association between the SLCO1B1*5 variant and side-effects was found also in patients treated with atorvastatin but not, apparently, with pravastatin and categorized as carriers of mild-myopathy. Recently a similar evidence has been suggested in type 2 diabetic patients treated mainly with simvastatin. However another relevant issue is that, apart from genetic influence in liver transporters influencing drug levels, the complexity of mechanisms involved in the muscular side effects of statins has been addressed by the evidence of other influencing pathways such as the variant within the COQ2 gene involved in Coenzyme Q(10) mild-asymptomatic deficiency and skeletal muscle drug transporters expression. In conclusion, the picture of putative pharmacogenetic modulation of statins safety is reaching a growing body of evidence for translation into clinical practice but more specific studies for each single statin, in different clinical settings, both from genome-wide or competitive candidate genes evaluation, are needed before describing a definitive class-risk profile.", 
    "29": "High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are small particles comprised of phospholipids and stabilizing proteins, which carry cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood stream. The incidence of cardiovascular events is high in patients with low level of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C). In the present study, we defined The PH index [\u0394coronary plaque volume/\u0394HDL-C] index as a putative clinical index of cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL from atheromatous plaque. The present study investigated the PH index in response to treatment with different types of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), in contrast to similar changes in the PL index [\u0394coronary plaque volume/\u0394low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)] by the same statins. Using the 2000-2011 PubMed database, the search keywords were \"statins\" and \"intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)\" and \"plaque volume\". Cross references were checked. PubMed search identified 29 references, and finally 4 published studies were selected for data analysis. The PL index, representing the change in plaque volume induced by 1% reduction in LDL-C, showed no difference among the different statins. On the other hand, the PH index, representing the change in plaque volume induced by 1% increase in HDL-C, showed wide variability among the different statins; 1.4 by atorvastatin, 1.0 by pravastatin, -0.1 by simvastatin, -0.2 or -0.5 by rosuvastatin, and -1.8 by pitavastatin. In conclusion, the best coronary plaque regression index attributed to HDL-cholesterol elevation (PH index) was found in pitavastatin treatment, in comparison with the other 4 statins (atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin) investigated in the articles scanned by their search.",

In the first part of the work, formulations with high amounts of Gelucire(\u00ae) 44/14 (80%) and solvents of different polarities (diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, propyleneglycol, propylene glycol monocaprylate and glyceryl mono/dicaprylate/caprate) were prepared for miscibility screening evaluation by classical least squares (CLS). It was observed that Gelucire(\u00ae) 44/14 presented higher affinity for the lipophilic solvents glyceryl mono/dicaprylate/caprate and propylene glycol monocaprylate, whose samples were observed to be homogeneous, and lower affinity for the hydrophilic solvents diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and propyleneglycol, whose samples were heterogeneous. In the second part of the work, the ratio of glyceryl mono/dicaprylate/caprate and Gelucire(\u00ae) 44/14 was determined based on studies in water and allowed the selection of the proportions of these two excipients in the preconcentrate that provided supersaturation of atorvastatin upon dilution. The preconcentrate was then evaluated for homogeneity by partial least squares (PLS) and an excellent miscibility was observed in this proportion as well. Therefore, it was possible to select a formulation that presented simultaneously homogeneous preconcentrate and solubility enhancement in water by Raman image spectroscopy and chemometrics.", 
    "55": "The aims of this study were to formulate a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) by a rational formulation approach using mixture experimental design and to derive general concepts that make the development of such systems more feasible. Various types of oils and surfactants were systematically combined and the phase behaviour upon dilution with simulated gastric fluid examined by construction of phase diagrams. The systems solubilising the highest amount of simulated gastric fluid in the continuous microemulsion area were selected for investigation and optimisation of drug solubility. Simvastatin was added as a poorly water-soluble, lipophilic model drug. Two different mixture experimental designs using D-optimal design were set up and used to investigate the solubility of simvastatin in the SMEDDS before and after dilution with simulated gastric fluid respectively. The solubility in each mixture region was analysed by fitting quadratic models using partial least squares analysis. The established models revealed the influence of mixture components on phase behaviour and drug solubility and gave the rationale for formulation optimisation. This study demonstrated that the development of complex self-emulsifying formulations with sufficient solubilisation capacity for poorly water-soluble drugs upon oral administration can be more feasible when using experimental design.",

Electron probe X-ray microanalyses and oligonucleotide microarrays were used to identify the global effects of micromolar concentrations of atorvastatin on the gene expression and cell viability of endothelial cells in different states of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-induced activation. Treatment with 1-\u03bcM atorvastatin for 24 hours significantly reduced the viability of human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). However, the same treatment of LPA-preactivated HUVECs produced elevated cell viability levels and an optimal vascular gene expression profile, including endothelial nitric oxide synthase overexpression, endothelin-1 repression, an anti-inflammatory genetic pattern, and upregulation of molecules involved in maintaining the endothelial barrier (vascular endothelial cadherin, claudin 5, tight junction protein 1, integrin \u03b24). The atorvastatin treatment also produced a repression of microRNA 21 and genes involved in cell proliferation and neointimal formation (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] A, VEGF receptor 1, VEGFC). Results obtained suggest that micromolar atorvastatin therapy can enhance global endothelial function, but its effects on cell viability vary according to the baseline state of cell activation (preactivated, postactivated, or not activated). Preactivation with LPA protects HUVECs against atorvastatin-induced apoptosis and delivers optimal levels of cell viability and functionality.",

It remains unclear whether strategies aimed at increasing HDL-C in addition to background statin therapy will further reduce risk. The AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) trial, which compared combined niacin/simvastatin with simvastatin alone, failed to demonstrate an incremental benefit of niacin among patients with atherosclerotic CVD and on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values <70 mg/dl, but this study had some limitations. Previously, small randomized, clinical trials of niacin plus statins showed that modest regression of carotid atherosclerosis is possible in individuals with CVD, CVD risk equivalents, or atherosclerosis.

This study aimed to examine the effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) on LPL production and to investigate the mechanism by which statins enhance skeletal muscle cell LPL production. L6 skeletal muscle cells were incubated with pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin or pitavastatin. LPL activity, protein levels and mRNA expression were measured. Atorvastatin and pitavastatin significantly increased LPL activity, protein levels and mRNA expression in L6 skeletal muscle cells at 1 \u03bcmol/L, but neither statin had an effect at 10 \u03bcmol/L. We measured AMPK to clarify the mechanism by which statins increase LPL production in skeletal muscle cells. At 1 \u03bcmol/L, both atorvastatin and pitavastatin enhanced AMPK activity, but this enhancement was abolished when AMPK signaling was blocked by compound C. The increased expressions of LPL protein and mRNA by atorvastatin and pitavastatin were reduced by compound C. In addition, mevalonic acid abolished atorvastatin- and pitavastatin-induced AMPK activation and LPL expression. These results suggest that atorvastatin and pitavastatin increase LPL activity, protein levels and LPL mRNA expression by activating AMPK in skeletal muscle cells.",

In the 1970s the first useful inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis were isolated, and paved the way for what would become a multimillion dollar pharmaceutical industry. Modern-day statins are incredibly effective hypolipidaemic agents, interrupting cholesterol biosynthesis at the rate-limiting step through a competitive inhibition mechanism. These compounds' structures interact with key amino acid residues through a variety of defined bonding interactions, and by understanding how these interactions form, better, and safer, hypolipidaemic agents were found.

Childhood hypercholesterolaemia can be either primary, due to hereditary disorders such as familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCHL), or secondary due to obesity, diabetes mellitus or nephrotic syndrome. Current guidelines suggest screening for hypercholesterolaemia between the ages of 2 and 10 years. Treatment strategies include lifestyle interventions involving dietary changes and increased physical activity. If these interventions are insufficient in lowering serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, pharmacological therapy should be considered from the age of 8 years. Currently, statins are the preferred initial pharmacological therapy and have proven to be both efficient and well tolerated.

Tandem mass spectrometry operated under the multiple reaction monitoring mode was used for detection, providing low quantitation limits in the 0.25-0.5\u2009ng/mL concentration interval. This method was validated and used for quantitation of simvastatin and its hydroxy acid metabolite in incurred plasma samples obtained from two volunteers participating in a bioequivalence study, using lovastatin and its hydroxy analog as internal standards. The results were statistically compared with those produced by means of an alternative RPLC-tandem MS using protein precipitation with acetonitrile. The quality attributes of the two methods are comparatively discussed. The agreement between the quality characteristics of the two methods and the experimental results obtained on real samples may be considered as a consistent basis for the simultaneous use of limonene as extraction medium and injection diluent for hydrophobic compounds in bioanalytical approaches.", 
    "109": "Interindividual variability in cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is believed to be largely heritable; however, predictive genetic factors have remained scarce. Using a candidate-gene approach in a human liver bank, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Ah-receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRMC2), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPARA) that are associated with CYP3A4 phenotype. Validation in atorvastatin-treated volunteers confirmed a decrease in atorvastatin-2-hydroxylation in carriers of PPARA SNP rs4253728. Homozygous carriers expressed significantly less PPAR-\u03b1 protein in the liver. Moreover, shRNA-mediated PPARA gene knockdown in primary human hepatocytes decreased expression levels of the PPAR-\u03b1 target ACOX1 and of CYP3A4 by more than 50%. In conclusion, this study identified novel genetic determinants of CYP3A4 that, together with nongenetic factors, explained 52, 55, and 33% of hepatic CYP3A4 mRNA, protein, and atorvastatin-2-hydroxylase activity, respectively. These findings have implications for variability in response to drug substrates of CYP3A4.", 
    "110": "Recent studies have indicated that autophagy may be one of the important pathways induced by ionizing radiation. Atorvastatin (statin), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, may exhibit anticancer effects as an autophagy inducer. In our study, the cell killing and radiosensitizing effects of statin were analyzed in PC3 cell line. Activation of the autophagy pathway was analyzed using the GFP-LC3 assay and western blot to determine LC3-II expression. The radiosensitivity of PC3 cells was determined using the clonal survival assay, TUNEL assay, and the Annexin V apoptosis assay. The expression profiles of autophagy related genes were analyzed using a pathway specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. Autophagic response was induced in PC3 cells after exposure to statin and/or gamma rays. Inhibition of the autophagic process using small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting Atg7 and/or Atg12 significantly reduced radiosensitivity of PC3 cells. Statin also exhibited a significant apoptosis-inducing effect in PC3 cells, which can be partially suppressed by Atg7 siRNA. Cells treated with statin and gamma irradiation showed significantly reduced colony forming efficiency and increased number of Annexin V positive early apoptotic cells. Analysis of autophagy and its regulatory gene profile showed that the expressions of 22 genes out of 86 genes assessed were significantly altered in the cells exposed to combined treatment or statin alone. The data indicate that activation of the autophagy pathway may be responsible for apoptosis inducing effect of statin. Furthermore, combined treatment with radiation and autophagic inducer, such as statin, may be synergistic in inducing cell death of PC3 cells.",

The present study determined the antinociceptive property of centrally administered simvastatin on the formalin-induced nociception in the mouse. Intrathecal administration of simvastatin at doses of 0.5 - 50 nmol dose-dependently attenuated the second, but not the first, phase of the formalin-induced nociception, which was partially reversed by mevalonate (5 \u00b5mol). Intracerebroventricular injection of simvastatin (50 nmol) did not affect the formalin-induced nociception. These results suggest that simvastatin-induced antinociception is mediated by attenuation of the sensitization of spinal nociceptive transmission.",

Moreover, epidemiological studies have pointed an association between statin treatment and a decrease in the risk of having AD. For these reasons, a large number of clinical trials have been carried out to determine whether the statins can prevent the progression of AD. However, these studies did not provide clear evidence for the therapeutic efficacy in AD. We consider that there are a number of explanations for this failure that may provide guidance for selecting and clinically developing statins with therapeutic efficacy in AD.", 
    "113": "Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) has been widely used to treat various malignant tumors including human non-small-cell-lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). However, the tumor-inhibitory effect of IFN-\u03b3 displays not satisfactory in NSCLC treatment due to the lack of immunogenicity of NSCLCs. This study demonstrated that inhibition of RhoA activity led to significant inhibition of NSCLC cell growth accompanied by decreased expression of c-myc and cyclin D1 and increased levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and peptide transporter protein 1 (TAP1) which are involved in tumor immunity. Combination treatment of atorvastatin and IFN-\u03b3 resulted in a synergistic inhibition of NSCLC cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Though IFN-\u03b3 alone exerted minimal inhibitory effect on RhoA activity, additional administration of atorvastatin could result in a significant inhibition of RhoA activity, thus substantially suppressing NSCLC cell growth. Specifically, atorvastatin could induce specific deposition of endogenous IFN-\u03b3 in tumors while not in other normal tissues in LLC-harbored mice. In conclusion, atorvastatin can enhance IFN-\u03b3 sensitivity in NSCLCs both in vitro and in vivo, probably through induction of a synergistic inhibitory effect on RhoA activity. This study also suggests a potential alternative of combination of atorvastatin and IFN-\u03b3 in clinical therapy against NSCLCs.",

Atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline was orally administered for 2 weeks. All animals were assessed by neurobehavioral tests before surgery and at days 3, 7, 14 after surgery. Inflammatory and neuroprotective factors were evaluated by Western blot analysis. eNOS, COX2 and iNOS in the sciatic nerve were also studied using immunohistochemistry. Atorvastatin attenuated CCI-induced nociceptive sensitization and thermal hyperalgesia in a time-dependent manner. Atorvastatin improved CCI-induced neurobehavioral/inflammatory activity by inhibition of TGF-beta, pIkB/IkB, NFkB, COX2, iNOS, EP1 and EP4 in the sciatic nerve. Atorvastatin was also found to increase neuroprotection factors pAkt/Akt, eNOS and VEGF.

    "122": "Chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) atherosclerotic events. The inflammatory state, which is the hallmark of chronic rheumatic diseases, is the important driving force for accelerated atherogenesis. Since the control of traditional risk factors alone is insufficient in reducing the risk, much attention has been directed towards the potential use of statins. Statins, a family of drugs that suppress cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, have been shown to significantly reduce CV-related morbidity and mortality. In addition to lower lipid levels, several non-lipid lowering pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities, make statins potential therapeutic agents in chronic rheumatic diseases. However, lipid metabolism in chronic rheumatic diseases is complex, since inflammatory states can induce alterations in lipid levels and function, so that cholesterol target levels from general guidelines may not be adequate in chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Larger trials are needed to refine the precise benefits and health-utility associated with this therapy.", 
    "123": "Ichthyoses, including inherited disorders of lipid metabolism, display a permeability barrier abnormality in which the severity of the clinical phenotype parallels the prominence of the barrier defect. The pathogenesis of the cutaneous phenotype represents the consequences of the mutation for epidermal function, coupled with a \"best attempt\" by affected epidermis to generate a competent barrier in a terrestrial environment. A compromised barrier in normal epidermis triggers a vigorous set of metabolic responses that rapidly normalizes function, but ichthyotic epidermis, which is inherently compromised, only partially succeeds in this effort. Unraveling mechanisms that account for barrier dysfunction in the ichthyoses has identified multiple, subcellular, and biochemical processes that contribute to the clinical phenotype. Current treatment of the ichthyoses remains largely symptomatic: directed toward reducing scale or corrective gene therapy. Reducing scale is often minimally effective. Gene therapy is impeded by multiple pitfalls, including difficulties in transcutaneous drug delivery, high costs, and discomfort of injections. We have begun to use information about disease pathogenesis to identify novel, pathogenesis-based therapeutic strategies for the ichthyoses. The clinical phenotype often reflects not only a deficiency of pathway end product due to reduced-function mutations in key synthetic enzymes but often also accumulation of proximal, potentially toxic metabolites. As a result, depending upon the identified pathomechanism(s) for each disorder, the accompanying ichthyosis can be treated by topical provision of pathway product (eg, cholesterol), with or without a proximal enzyme inhibitor (eg, simvastatin), to block metabolite production. Among the disorders of distal cholesterol metabolism, the cutaneous phenotype in Congenital Hemidysplasia with Ichthyosiform Erythroderma and Limb Defects (CHILD syndrome) and X-linked ichthyosis reflect metabolite accumulation and deficiency of pathway product (ie, cholesterol). We validated this therapeutic approach in two CHILD syndrome patients who failed to improve with topical cholesterol alone, but cleared with dual treatment with cholesterol plus lovastatin. In theory, the ichthyoses in other inherited lipid metabolic disorders could be treated analogously. This pathogenesis (pathway)-driven approach possesses several inherent advantages: (1) it is mechanism-specific for each disorder; (2) it is inherently safe, because natural lipids and/or approved drugs often are utilized; and (3) it should be inexpensive, and therefore it could be used widely in the developing world.",

Low HDL-C and high TG levels are common and are recognized as independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, atherogenic dyslipidemia, characterized by low levels of HDL-C, high TG, and small, dense LDL particles, is a typical phenotype of dyslipidemia in subjects with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, to reduce further the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), raising HDL-C and lowering TG may be the secondary therapeutic target for patients who achieve LDL-C levels below the currently recommended targets but are still at risk of CHD. However, whether increasing HDL-C levels alone reduces CHD has not yet been confirmed in large randomized clinical trials, and whether functional HDL is more important than HDL-C in reducing CHD remains controversial.

Pravastatin sodium physical mixtures and solid dispersions were prepared using various bile salts. The physicochemical characteristics and permeation profiles were investigated using pravastatin sodium-bile salt physical mixtures and solid dispersions. Pravastatin in the physical mixture did not achieve amorphous state, whereas that in the solid dispersion was completely converted to amorphous state. The permeation enhancement factors ranged between 1.13 and 11.9 with the addition of bile salts, and the permeation flux of pravastatin sodium greatly increased as the sodium cholate (NaC) concentration increased from 5 to 10 mM. Pravastatin sodium permeation fluxes [\u00b5g/(cm(2) h)] from solid dispersions (drug-NaC = 1:49) (20.8 \u00b1 2.7) were much higher than those from physical mixtures (4.7 \u00b1 3.1) and commercial tablets (3.5 \u00b1 1.2) (p < 0.05). The dissolution rates of pravastatin sodium from solid dispersions in pH 1.2 were much lower than those from physical mixtures and commercial products, whereas more than 97% of pravastatin sodium was dissolved at 5 min in pH 6.8. On the basis of the results, it was concluded that pravastatin sodium solid dispersions containing bile salts could enhance drug absorption.",

To help address the significant challenges facing the ATP IV writing group, this statement aims to provide balanced recommendations that build on ATP III. The authors aim for simplicity to increase the likelihood of implementation in clinical practice. To move from ATP III to ATP IV, the authors recommend the following: (1) assess risk more accurately, (2) simplify the starting algorithm, (3) prioritize statin therapy, (4) relax the follow-up interval for repeat lipid testing, (5) designate <70 mg/dl as an \"ideal\" low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target, (6) endorse targets beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, (7) refine therapeutic target levels to the equivalent population percentile, (8) remove misleading descriptors such as \"borderline high,\" and (9) make lifestyle messages simpler.

    "176": "Heat generated during implant osteotomy might lead to osteonecrosis and delayed bone repair, thus resulting in impaired early osseointegration and fixation of bone-anchoring devices. In this study, we proposed to overcome heat-induced injury to bone by fabricating core-shell polymeric biodegradable microspheres encapsulating a mitogenic factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and a differentiation factor, simvastatin, in a simultaneous or sequential release profile. Microspheres encapsulating bovine serum albumin (BSA), PDGF, simvastatin, PDGF-in-core with simvastatin-in-shell, and simvastatin-in-core with PDGF-in-shell were delivered to fill standardized osteotomy sites on edentulous ridges of rat maxillae under irrigated or non-irrigated conditions. In the absence of irrigation, significant reduction of cell viability and increase in inflammation and sequestrum formation without evidence of osteogenesis were observed. Both PDGF and simvastatin deliveries facilitated cell viability and reduced osteonecrosis. Localized osteogenesis was seen under simvastatin treatment, while generalized but primitive osteogenesis was noted in PDGF-treated osteotomy sites. In addition, sequential PDGF-simvastatin delivery further augmented osteogenesis and promoted bone maturation. The results suggested that sequential PDGF-simvastatin delivery was an effective modality to prevent heat-induced complications and facilitate bone apposition after implant osteotomy, potentially favoring the early fixation of bone-anchoring devices and oral implant osseointegration.", 
    "177": "Patients with critical limb ischemia have higher rates of death and amputation after revascularization compared to patients with intermittent claudication. However, the differences in patency after percutaneous revascularization of the superficial femoral artery are uncertain and impact the long-term risk of amputation and function in critical limb ischemia. We identified 171 limbs from 136 consecutive patients who had angioplasty and/or stenting for super\ufb01cial femoral artery stenoses or occlusions from July 2003 through June 2007. Patients were followed for primary and secondary patency, death and amputation up to 2.5 years, and 111 claudicants were retrospectively compared to the 25 patients with critical limb ischemia. Successful percutaneous revascularization occurred in 128 of 142 limbs (90%) with claudication versus 25 of 29 limbs (86%) with critical limb ischemia (p = 0.51). Overall secondary patency at 2.5 years was 91% for claudication and 88% for critical limb ischemia. In Cox proportional hazards models, percutaneous revascularization for critical limb ischemia had similar long-term primary patency (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.4, 2.6; p = 0.89) and secondary patency (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.2, 6.0; p = 0.95) to revascularization for claudication. Patients with critical limb ischemia had higher mortality and death rates compared to claudicants, with prior statin use associated with less death (p = 0.034) and amputation (p = 0.010), and prior clopidogrel use associated with less amputation (p = 0.034). In conclusion, percutaneous superficial femoral artery revascularization is associated with similar long-term durability in both groups. Intensive treatment of atherosclerosis risk factors and surveillance for restenosis likely contribute to improving the long-term outcomes of both manifestations of peripheral artery disease.", 
    "178": "Many clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of statins on cardiovascular risk, both in patients with history of coronary heart disease and in healthy subjects with risk factors, because of a significant reduction in acute coronary events. The introduction of more powerful statins in the market offered the opportunity to study whether an intensive lipid lowering treatment could yields even better cardiovascular outcomes than a moderate statin therapy and several clinical trial confirmed this hypothesis. Statins have also pleiotropic effect behind their lipid lowering function: they reduce inflammation, which plays an important role in the atherosclerotic process.",

Risk of atrial fibrillation increased with age, SBP and pulse pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, BMI, serum creatinine and history of hypertension, coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease (all P\u200a<\u200a0.01). After adjustment for BMI and other variables, atrial fibrillation risk increased with hip circumference. History of hypertension was associated with a 34% higher risk of new atrial fibrillation. New atrial fibrillation portended an increased risk of congestive heart failure [hazard ratio 2.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.45-3.40, P\u200a<\u200a0.01] and cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.41, P\u200a<\u200a0.01).

    "183": "Caveolae, little caves of cell surfaces, are enriched in cholesterol, a certain level of which is required for their structural integrity. Here we show in adipocytes that cavin-2, a peripheral membrane protein and one of 3 cavin isoforms present in caveolae from non-muscle tissue, is degraded upon cholesterol depletion in a rapid fashion resulting in collapse of caveolae. We exposed 3T3-L1 adipocytes to the cholesterol depleting agent methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, which results in a sudden and extensive degradation of cavin-2 by the proteasome and a concomitant movement of cavin-1 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol along with loss of caveolae. The recovery of cavin-2 at the plasma membrane is cholesterol-dependent and is required for the return of cavin-1 from the cytosol to the cell surface and caveolae restoration. Expression of shRNA directed against cavin-2 also results in a cytosolic distribution of cavin-1 and loss of caveolae. Taken together, these data demonstrate that cavin-2 functions as a cholesterol responsive component of caveolae that is required for cavin-1 localization to the plasma membrane, and caveolae structural integrity.", 
    "184": "Recently we reported that statins, the competitive inhibitors of the key enzyme regulating the mevalonate pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), decrease proliferation of human endometrial stromal (HES) cells. Furthermore, we found that simvastatin treatment reduces the number and the size of endometrial implants in a nude mouse model of endometriosis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of simvastatin on HES cell invasiveness and on expression of selected genes relevant to invasiveness: matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP3, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2), and CD44. Because statin-induced inhibition of HMGCR reduces the production of substrates for isoprenylation-geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)-the effects of GGPP and FPP were also evaluated. Simvastatin induced a concentration-dependent reduction of invasiveness of HES cells. This effect of simvastatin was abrogated by GGPP but not by FPP. Simvastatin also reduced the mRNA levels of MMP2, MMP3, and CD44, but increased TIMP2 mRNA; all these effects of simvastatin were partly or entirely reversed in the presence of GGPP. The present findings provide a novel mechanism of action of simvastatin on endometrial stroma that may explain reduction of endometriosis in animal models of this disease. Furthermore, the presently described effects of simvastatin are likely mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of geranylgeranylation.", 
    "185": "Cerebrovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetes. Compared with nondiabetic patients, diabetic patients have at least twice the risk for stroke, earlier onset of symptoms, and worse functional outcomes. Approximately 20\u00a0% of diabetic patients will die from stroke, making it one of the leading causes of death in this population. Effective strategies for primary and secondary prevention of stroke have been developed in research cohorts that included both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Nevertheless, prevention in diabetes has some specific considerations. In this paper, we summarize evidence to guide the diagnosis and management of stroke in diabetic patients. We propose that diabetic stroke patients should have a robust risk assessment to target interventions, like other patients with cerebrovascular disease, but with special attention to glycemic control and lifestyle modification.", 
    "186": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now established as a progressive compromise not only of the neurons but also of the cerebral vasculature. Increasing evidence also indicates that cerebrovascular dysfunction may be a key or an aggravating pathogenic factor in AD, emphasizing the importance to properly control this deficit when aiming for effective therapy. Here, we report that simvastatin (3-6 months, 40 mg/kg/d) completely rescued cerebrovascular reactivity, basal endothelial nitric oxide synthesis, and activity-induced neurometabolic and neurovascular coupling in adult (6 months) and aged (12 months) transgenic mice overexpressing the Swedish and Indiana mutations of the human amyloid precursor protein (AD mice). Remarkably, simvastatin fully restored short- and long-term memory in adult, but not in aged AD mice. These beneficial effects occurred without any decreasing effect of simvastatin on brain amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) levels or plaque load. However, in AD mice with recovered memory, protein levels of the learning- and memory-related immediate early genes c-Fos and Egr-1 were normalized or upregulated in hippocampal CA1 neurons, indicative of restored neuronal function. In contrast, the levels of phospholipase A2, enkephalin, PSD-95, synaptophysin, or glutamate NMDA receptor subunit type 2B were either unaltered in AD mice or unaffected by treatment. These findings disclose new sites of action for statins against A\u03b2-induced neuronal and cerebrovascular deficits that could be predictive of therapeutic benefit in AD patients. They further indicate that simvastatin and, possibly, other brain penetrant statins bear high therapeutic promise in early AD and in patients with vascular diseases who are at risk of developing AD.", 
    "187": "Polypill has been a hot issue since it was first advanced in 2003. This new concept immediately spurred a worldwide discussion. Xuezhikang is a partially purified extract of fermented red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus). It is composed of 13 kinds of natural statins, unsaturated fatty acids, ergosterol, amino acids, flavonoids, alkaloid, trace element, and other substances, and thus could be regarded as a natural lipid-lowering polypill. Interestingly, Xuezhikang in the China Coronary Secondary Prevention Study trial lowered lipid levels less as compared with provastatin in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial, but seemed to gain more benefit in reducing the cardiovascular events and the risk of death from cancer. In recent years, Xuezhikang has been further demonstrated to have additional health benefits and thus raised great interest. This article reviews the clinical benefits of Xuezhikang and the potential multicomponent synergetic mechanism. The authors hold that polypill is anticipated to be a more effective and feasible way to treat complicated diseases.",

In this paper, we will review the role of biomarkers in acute coronary syndromes, heart failure and risk stratification for cardiovascular events as guide for treatment scribing. In particular, high sensitivity assays for troponin evaluation detect with greater precision patients with elevated troponin. Therefore, direct and appropriate management is succeeded in these patients with reduction of complications due to earlier treatment, as well. Regarding heart failure, randomized trials that have evaluated biomarker guided treatment approach have not succeeded in establishing specific results for natriuretic peptides (BNP, NT-proBNP) use in terms of therapy guidance. Apart from them, a variety of novel or already used biomarkers, have been tested by small trials for heart failure management, without however, managing to dominate in every day care. Finally, as far as risk stratification for cardiovascular events is concerned, hsCRP has proved to be a strong but doubted biomarker. Therefore, lifestyle and behavioral modification remain the cornerstone of primary prevention.",

Lactobacillus plantarum LpT1 and the positive control lovastatin could significantly degrade the total cholesterol content (p<0.01) after 28 days, higher than Lactobacillus plantarum LpT2 (p<0.05). However, the negative control water could not degrade it. The transmission electron microscope result showed that the strains could effectively regulate the lipid metabolism to develop towards the regular trend after they were absorbed into the intestines.",

    "193": "Cancer and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of death worldwide. Cardiovascular medications have recently been found to have favorable effects also for the treatment of noncardiovascular diseases, including cancer. In this review, we use a reverse bedside-to-bench approach to investigate the effects of common cardiovascular medications on tumor angiogenesis and vascular angiogenesis. Aspirin seems to reduce the risk of developing cancer, particularly colon cancer. However, whether the protective influence of aspirin is due to antiangiogenesis effect is still unclear. \u03b2-Blockers, which are normally used to reduce heart rate and prolong diastole, trigger an increase in stretch-associated release of proangiogenic growth factors thereby inducing angiogenesis. However, according to other studies \u03b2-blockers are able to inhibit angiogenesis via multiplicate mechanisms. Similarly, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker have controversial effects for the regulation of cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Statins can augment collateral vascular growth in ischemic tissues and restrict the development of cancer. So this topical anti-inflammatory drug seems to be of high value for further therapy. Finally, suggestions on how this pilot experience may guide the conduct of future preclinical investigations, and clinical trials are discussed.",

Diabetes mellitus is not associated with acute lung injury but is associated with cardiac overload. A diagnosis of cardiac overload excludes a diagnosis of acute lung injury. Investigators who do not account for cardiac overload as a competing alternative outcome may therefore falsely conclude that diabetes mellitus protects from acute lung injury."
