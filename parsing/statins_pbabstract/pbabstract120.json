Molecular alterations contributing to MPNST formation have only partially been resolved. Here we examined the role of Pten, a key regulator of the Pi3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, in human MPNST and benign neurofibromas. Immunohistochemistry showed that Pten expression was significantly lower in MPNST (n=16) than in neurofibromas (n=16) and normal nervous tissue. To elucidate potential mechanisms for Pten down-regulation or Akt/mTOR activation in MPNST we performed further experiments. Mutation analysis revealed absence of somatic mutations in PTEN (n=31) and PIK3CA (n=38). However, we found frequent PTEN promotor methylation in primary MPNST (11/26) and MPNST cell lines (7/8) but not in benign nerve sheath tumours. PTEN methylation was significantly associated with early metastasis. Moreover, we detected an inverse correlation of Pten-regulating miR-21 and Pten protein levels in MPNST cell lines. The examination of NF1-/- and NF1+/+Schwann cells and fibroblasts showed that Pten expression is not regulated by NF1. To determine the significance of Pten status for treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin we treated 5 MPNST cell lines with rapamycin. All cell lines were sensitive to rapamycin without a significant correlation to Pten levels. When rapamycin was combined with simvastatin a synergistic anti-proliferative effect was achieved. Taken together we show frequent loss/reduction of Pten expression in MPNST and provide evidence for the involvement of multiple Pten regulating mechanisms.", 
    "1": "To compare the therapeutic effects of intensive versus moderate dosage of atorvastatin regimens in new-onset unstable angina with borderline lesions, 100 patients were randomized to receive either 80 mg/d or 20 mg/d atorvastatin for 9 months. Clinical symptoms, lipid profiles, and coronary stenosis (evaluated by coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound) were compared to their corresponding baselines within each group and between the 2 groups after 9 months of treatment. The results showed that (1) when compared to their corresponding baselines, both groups exhibited improvement in clinical symptoms, a significant decrease in total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP; P < .01) and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); (2) the improvement in clinical symptoms and the decrease in LDL-C and hs-CRP were significantly greater (P < .01) in the intensive-dose group than in the moderate-dose group; (3) the mean plaque volume did not progress in the intensive-dose group but increased significantly (P < .05) in the moderate-dose group. We conclude that compared to the moderate dose, the intensive-dose regimen significantly improves clinical symptoms, lowers LDL-C and hs-CRP, and halts the progression of borderline atherosclerotic plaques in patients with new-onset unstable angina.",

    "3": "Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive either rosuvastatin (5 mg/kg every day) or placebo (0.5% CMC-Na), respectively, by daily gavage from 7 days before AMI. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) model was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation through a lateral thoracotomy in rats. The expressions of stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), chemokine motif CXC receptor 4 (CXCR-4), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in peri-infarction region and nonischemic region at different time points were determined by the Western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on the 28th day after AMI to investigate the accumulation of CD90+, CD133+, and c-kit+ progenitor cells in the peri-infarction region. Masson staining and echocardiograph were performed to evaluate the left ventricular remodeling and postinfarction cardiac function 4 weeks after AMI.", 
    "4": "Western blot analysis showed that rosuvastatin could change the cytokine expressions in the peri-infarction region by upregulating the SDF-1 expression and downregulating the expressions of CXCR-4, ICAM-1, and VEGF in 4 to 14 days after AMI. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that rosuvastatin treatment was associated with increased accumulation of CD90+, CD133+, and c-kit+ progenitor cells in the peri-infarction region. Masson staining and echocardiograph confirmed that rosuvastatin could attenuate left ventricular remodeling and improve postinfarction systolic function.", 
    "5": "The data suggest that rosuvastatin can protect the heart from ischemic injury and preserve the cardiac function in rats in vivo. The changing expressions of SDF-1, CXCR-4, ICAM-1, and VEGF, and the accumulation of progenitor cells were involved in this process.", 
    "6": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) is widely available as a dietary supplement and remains under consideration as a treatment for age-associated neurodegenerative conditions. However, no studies have determined if supplementation, initiated relatively late in life, could have beneficial effects on mild functional impairments associated with normal brain aging. Accordingly, the current study assessed the effect of CoQ intake in older mice for which cognitive and psychomotor impairments were already evident. Separate groups of young (3.5 months) and relatively old mice (17.5 months) were fed a control diet or a diet supplemented with low (0.72 mg/g) or high (2.81 mg/g) concentrations of CoQ for 15 weeks. After 6 weeks, the mice were given tests for spatial learning (Morris water maze), spontaneous locomotor activity, motor coordination, and startle reflex. Age-related impairments in cognitive and psychomotor functions were evident in the 17.5-month-old mice fed the control diet, and the low-CoQ diet failed to affect any aspect of the impaired performance. However, in the Morris water maze test, old mice on the high-CoQ diet swam to the safe platform with greater efficiency than the mice on the control diet. The old mice supplemented with the high-CoQ diet did not show improvement when spatial performance was measured using probe trials and failed to show improvement in other tests of behavioral performance. Protein oxidative damage was decreased in the mitochondria from the heart, liver, and skeletal muscle of the high-CoQ-supplemented mice and, to some extent, in the brain mitochondria. Contrasting with the deleterious effect of long-term CoQ supplementation initiated during young adulthood previously published, this study suggests that CoQ improves spatial learning and attenuates oxidative damage when administered in relatively high doses and delayed until early senescence, after age-related declines have occurred. Thus, in individuals with age-associated symptoms of cognitive decline, high-CoQ intake may be beneficial.", 
    "7": "Adverse hypertrophic scars can form after healing of full-thickness skin wounds. Currently, reliable animal and in vitro models to identify and test novel scar reducing therapeutics are scarce. Here we describe the development and validation of a tissue-engineered human hypertrophic scar (HTscar) model based on reconstructed epidermis on a dermal matrix containing adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC). Although obtained from normal, healthy skin, ASC, in contrast to dermal mesenchymal cells, were found to facilitate HTscar formation. Quantifiable HTscar parameters were identified: contraction; thickness of dermis, collagen-1 secretion, epidermal outgrowth, epidermal thickness, and cytokine secretion (IL-6, CXCL8). The model was validated with therapeutics currently used for treating scars (5-fluorouracil, triamcinolon) and a therapeutic known to be unsuccessful in scar reduction (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D3). Furthermore, it was shown that atorvastatin, but not retinoic-acid, may provide a suitable alternative for scar treatment. Each therapeutic selectively affected a different combination of parameters, suggesting combined therapy may be most beneficial. This animal-free hypertrophic scar model may provide an alternative model for mechanistic studies as well as a novel in vitro means to test anti-scar therapeutics, thereby reducing the use of animals.", 
    "8": "In experimental studies, statin use has been associated with reduction of osteoclastic activity and promotion of bone formation around implants. Moreover, a large clinical study recently reported a substantially reduced risk of revision for aseptic loosening among statin users with THA. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of statin use on the development of femoral osteolysis within 5 years after THA. We conducted a case-cohort study including all THAs presenting with femoral osteolysis at the 5 year visit (cases) and compared them with those without osteolysis (controls). Cases and controls were identified from a cohort of primary THAs operated between 2001 and 2005. Seven hundred thirty-five THAs were included, mean age 68 years. Five years after surgery osteolysis had developed around the femoral component of 40 THAs (5.4%). Ever-use of statins was much less frequent among cases (5 of 40, 12.5%) than among controls (199 of 695, 28.6%). The crude risk ratio of femoral osteolysis among statin users was 0.36 (95% CI 0.14; 0.92). After adjusting for age, sex, activity level, BMI, diagnosis, bearing surface, and type of stem, the adjusted risk ratio was 0.38 (95% CI 0.15; 0.99). In conclusion, statin use was associated with a reduced risk of developing femoral osteolysis 5 years after THA. Statins may be useful for reducing the risk of implant failure following THA.",

    "11": "By means of the MCR-estimated diffraction patterns and concentration profiles, the trihydrate phase of the drug salt was found to dehydrate sequentially into two partially dehydrated hydrate structures upon heating from 25 to 110\u00b0C, with no associated breakage of the original crystal lattice. During heating from 110 to 140\u00b0C, the remaining water was lost from the solid drug salt, which instantly collapsed into a liquid crystalline phase. An isotropic melt was formed above 155\u00b0C. Thermogravimetric analysis, hot-stage polarized light microscopy, and hot-stage Raman spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis (PCA) was shown to provide consistent results.",

    "13": "Impaired wound healing is a major complication of diabetes. Recent studies have reported reduced lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis during diabetic wound healing, which are thought to be new therapeutic targets. Statins have effects beyond cholesterol reduction and can stimulate angiogenesis when used systemically. However, the effects of topically applied statins on wound healing have not been well investigated. The present study tested the hypothesis that topical application of simvastatin would promote lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis during wound healing in genetically diabetic mice. A full-thickness skin wound was generated on the back of the diabetic mice and treated with simvastatin or vehicle topically. Simvastatin administration resulted in significant acceleration of wound recovery, which was notable for increases in both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Furthermore, simvastatin promoted infiltration of macrophages, which produced vascular endothelial growth factor C in granulation tissues. In vitro, simvastatin directly promoted capillary morphogenesis and exerted an antiapoptotic effect on lymphatic endothelial cells. These results suggest that the favorable effects of simvastatin on lymphangiogenesis are due to both a direct influence on lymphatics and indirect effects via macrophages homing to the wound. In conclusion, a simple strategy of topically applied simvastatin may have significant therapeutic potential for enhanced wound healing in patients with impaired microcirculation such as that in diabetes.",

Drug-drug interactions associated with this polypharmacy are relatively new to the field of HCV pharmacotherapy. With the advent of the direct-acting antivirals telaprevir and boceprevir, which are both substrates and inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A iso-enzyme, knowledge and awareness of drug-drug interactions have become a cornerstone in the evaluation of patients starting and continuing HCV combination therapy. In our opinion, an overview of conducted drug-drug interaction studies and a list of contraindicated medications is not enough for the clinical management of these drug-drug interactions. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic profiles and concentration-effect relationships is key for the interpretation of these data, and insight into how to manage these interactions (e.g., dose adjustments, safe alternatives and therapeutic drug monitoring) is of equal importance. This review provides a practical overview of the safe and effective management of these clinical challenges.",

The SureTran matrix is a novel method facilitating short-term maintenance of fresh primary hepatocyte cellular function and offers the potential use of primary cells \"as fresh\" for several days post isolation. In the study presented, the maintenance of several key phase I and II drug metabolizing enzyme and drug transporter activities is demonstrated with rat and dog hepatocytes preserved for up to 7 days after cell isolation. 2. Intrinsic clearance values were determined for 60 new chemical entities using rat hepatocytes freshly isolated at AstraZeneca and rat hepatocytes prepared at the facilities of Abcellute Ltd (SureTran purveyors), stored and incubated 24 hours after isolation. A very good correspondence in the intrinsic clearance values underlines the utility of the cell maintenance matrix. 3. For human hepatocytes many of the enzyme activities assayed were well maintained for 7 days of storage but some declined to below 50% of initial values between day 4 and 7 of storage. Human OATP1B1 activity was only determined with one batch and declined to 51% of the initial test value by day 4 and further down to 35% by day 7.",

Increased Hcy concentration is responsible for early atherosclerosis with possible acute cardiovascular events. Ample evidence has demonstrated that Hcy lowering with folic acid and B vitamin supplementation, even if reduces Hcy serum levels, is unable to lower cardiovascular risk. On the contrary, omega-3 fatty acids and some nutraceuticals, such as N-acetyl cysteine, taurine, or S-adenosyl-methionine, reduce both Hcy serum concentration and cardiovascular risk. Instead, antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and clopidogrel or ticlopidine and statins only antagonize vascular derangements. Finally, metformin, some lipid-lowering drugs, and some diuretics should be avoided because they can increase Hcy levels.",

Lowering LDL-C after ACS leads to a significant reduction in recurrent events and overall mortality. A lower limit at which LDL-C reduction fails to decrease risk has not been determined, and lowering LDL-C below current guideline-defined targets may provide incremental benefit. While the absolute risk is small, more intensive statin therapy is associated with a higher incidence of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, liver enzyme abnormalities and incident diabetes, but not with an increase in malignancies or all-cause mortality. It is important that clinicians recognize ACS patients as being at very high risk, and provide these patients with intensive lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy for all modifiable risk factors. Within this framework, either a strategy of \"intensive statin treatment after ACS\" or a strategy of \"aggressive LDL-C targets after ACS\" would be appropriate based on currently available data. Combination lipid-lowering therapy does not have a firm evidence base at this point, but may be appropriate in patients with limited statin tolerance or very high baseline LDL-C levels.

However, the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. Cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is a ubiquitous glycoprotein present on the surfaces of various cells, including neurons, and is suggested to be involved in neurite outgrowth. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether PrP(C) mediates neurite outgrowth induced by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Atorvastatin, a strong HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, induced neurite outgrowth and increased PrP(C) levels in Neuro2a cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. PrP(C) mRNA expression was also increased by atorvastatin. Farnesol, a non-sterol mevalonate derivative, attenuated the atorvastatin-induced neurite outgrowth and increase in PrP(C). Neuro2a cells overexpressing PrP(C) showed a remarkable enhancement of atorvastatin-induced neurite outgrowth compared with mock cells transfected with empty pCI-neo vector. These findings suggest that PrP(C) contributes, at least in part, to atorvastatin-induced neurite outgrowth. This phenomenon may be included among the mechanisms underlying decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease in patients treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",

Consequently, a number of epidemiological studies have examined the effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs (i.e., statins) in the prevention and the treatment of AD. However, while retrospective studies suggested a potential benefit of statin therapy, clinical trials produced inconsistent results.

Rubus coreanus, which is widely cultivated in south eastern Asia, have been reported to show significant cholesterol lowering action in hyperlipidemic subjects. Our objective was to determine the cellular effect of Rubus coreanus extract (RCE) on cholesterol biosynthesis in human hepatic cells (HepG2) and to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which it causes change in cholesterol metabolism. RCE treatment lowered cholesterol biosynthesis as well as secretion from HepG2 cells. This effect was associated with lowering the release of apolipoproteins from hepatic cells. RCE treatment also showed an increase in phosphorylation of foxhead box protein 01 (FoXo-1) and 5-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), thus lowering expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and G6Pase, which might be a major pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition. Apart from this; RCE also lowered sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) expression in HepG2 cells, showing a long term regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis activity. These results indicate that one of the anti-hyperlipidemic actions of RCE is due to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in hepatic cells and provides first documentation of a hypolipidemic bio-molecular action of Rubus coreanus.", 
    "77": "The \"cholesterol hypothesis\" is the leading theory to explain the cause of atherosclerosis. The \"cholesterol hypothesis\" assumes that plasma (LDL) cholesterol is an important causal factor for atherosclerosis.However, data of at least seven placebo controlled randomized prospective trials with various cholesterol lowering drugs show that plasma cholesterol lowering does not necessarily lead to protection against cardiovascular disease. Therefore an alternative hypothesis for the etiology of cardiovascular disease is formulated. This alternative hypothesis, the \"mevalonate hypothesis\", assumes that after stimulation of the mevalonate pathway in endothelial cells by inflammatory factors, these cells start producing cholesterol and free radicals. In this hypothesis, only the latter play a role in the etiology of atherosclerosis by contributing to the formation of oxidized cholesterol which is a widely accepted causal factor for atherosclerosis.Regardless of how the mevalonate pathway is activated (by withdrawal of statin drugs, by inflammatory factors or indirectly by reduced intracellular cholesterol levels) in all these cases free radical production is observed as well as cardiovascular disease. Since in the \"mevalonate hypothesis\" cholesterol is produced at the same time as the free radicals causing atherosclerosis, this hypothesis provides an explanation for the correlation which exists between cardiovascular disease and plasma cholesterol levels. From an evolutionary perspective, concomitant cholesterol production and free radical production in response to inflammatory factors makes sense if one realizes that both activities potentially protect cells and organisms from infection by gram-negative bacteria.In conclusion, data have been collected which suggest that activation of the mevalonate pathway in endothelial cells is likely to be a causal factor for atherosclerosis. This \"mevalonate hypothesis\" provides a better explanation for results obtained from recent clinical studies with cholesterol lowering drugs than the \"cholesterol hypothesis\". Furthermore, this hypothesis explains how cholesterol can be correlated with cardiovascular disease without being a causal factor for it. Finally it provides a logical explanation for the etiology of this disease.", 
    "78": "As patients with type 2 diabetes receiving oral antidiabetic drugs are often concomitantly treated with other drugs, they are of increased risk for drug interactions. Drugs have to be taken up into hepatocytes before their intracellular drug action or before they are metabolized, and therefore, uptake transporters are important modulators of drug pharmacokinetics and drug effects. To gain more insights into the role of uptake transporters for drug interactions, we investigated whether frequently prescribed oral antidiabetic drugs interact with the transport of drugs, mediated by the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 (gene symbol SLCO1B1), OATP1B3 (gene symbol SLCO1B3) and OATP2B1 (gene symbol SLCO2B1). Using HEK293 cells recombinantly over-expressing these uptake transporters, we analysed whether glibenclamide, glimepiride, nateglinide and pioglitazone influence the transport of the model transport substrate bromosulfophthalein. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of the same oral antidiabetic drugs and of repaglinide and rosiglitazone on the uptake of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor atorvastatin. The oral antidiabetic drugs glibenclamide, glimepiride and nateglinide inhibited the transport of the model substrate bromosulfophthalein, particularly the OATP2B1-mediated uptake. The OATP-mediated atorvastatin uptake was inhibited in a similar manner. For glibenclamide, inhibitory constants (Ki values) of 13.6 \u03bcM, 8.1 \u03bcM and 0.5 \u03bcM for OATP1B1-, OATP1B3- and OATP2B1-mediated BSP uptake were determined. In conclusion, these in vitro results demonstrate that several oral antidiabetic drugs may influence hepatic OATP-mediated drug uptake. The in vivo consequences of these results have to be analysed in further studies.",

Although there are many therapeutic options for the treatment of Acanthamoeba, they are generally lengthy and/or have limited efficacy. Therefore, there is a requirement for the identification, validation, and development of novel therapeutic targets against these pathogens. Recently, RNA interference (RNAi) has been widely used for these validation purposes and has proven to be a powerful tool for Acanthamoeba therapeutics. Ergosterol is one of the major sterols in the membrane of Acanthamoeba. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, one of the precursors for the production of cholesterol in humans and ergosterol in plants, fungi, and protozoa. Statins are compounds which inhibit this enzyme and so are promising as chemotherapeutics. In order to validate whether this enzyme could be an interesting therapeutic target in Acanthamoeba, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against HMG-CoA were developed and used to evaluate the effects induced by the inhibition of Acanthamoeba HMG-CoA. It was found that HMG-CoA is a potential drug target in these pathogenic free-living amoebae, and various statins were evaluated in vitro against three clinical strains of Acanthamoeba by using a colorimetric assay, showing important activities against the tested strains.

    "111": "Dengue is the most important vector-borne viral infection of man, with approximately 2 billion people living in areas at risk. Infection results in a range of manifestations from asymptomatic infection through to life-threatening shock and haemorrhage. One of the hallmarks of severe dengue is vascular endothelial disruption. There is currently no specific therapy and clinical management is limited to supportive care. Statins are a class of drug initially developed for lipid lowering. There has been considerable recent interest in their effects beyond lipid lowering. These include anti-inflammatory effects at the endothelium. In addition, it is possible that lovastatin may have an anti-viral effect against dengue. Observational data suggest that the use of statins may improve outcomes for such conditions as sepsis and pneumonia. This paper describes the protocol for a randomised controlled trial investigating a short course of lovastatin therapy in adult patients with dengue.",

A target sample size of 300 patients in the second phase, enrolled over two dengue seasons, was chosen based on clinical judgement and feasibility considerations. In a previous randomised trial in dengue, about 10% and 30% of patients experienced at least one serious adverse event or adverse event, respectively. With 300 patients, we will have 80% power to detect an increase of 12% (from 10% to 22%) or 16% (from 30% to 46%) in the frequency of adverse events.

All these factors increase the likelihood of the development and worsening of CKD. In the meantime, nephrologists have developed new and better strategies to halt or at least slow the progression of CKD. These are based on the prescription to quit smoking and on dietary interventions guaranteeing an adequate calorie, protein, phosphate and sodium intake together with the correction of metabolic acidosis through either the supplementation of sodium bicarbonate or the choice of basic proteins.

    "145": "Nitric oxide generated by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) plays an important role in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis. Under various pathological conditions, abnormal expression of eNOS contributes to endothelial dysfunction and the development of cardiovascular diseases. A variety of pathological stimuli has been reported to decrease eNOS expression mainly through decreasing eNOS mRNA stability by regulating the binding of several cytosolic proteins to the cis-acting sequences within eNOS mRNA 3' untranslated regions. However, the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. Because microRNAs inhibit gene expression through binding to the 3' untranslated regions of their target mRNAs, microRNAs may be the important posttranscriptional modulators of eNOS expression. Here, we provided evidence that eNOS is a direct target of miR-155. Overexpression of miR-155 decreased, whereas inhibition of miR-155 increased, eNOS expression and NO production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in human internal mammary arteries. Inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 increased miR-155 expression. Inhibition of miR-155 reversed tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-induced downregulation of eNOS expression and impairment of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. Moreover, we observed that simvastatin attenuated tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-induced upregulation of miR-155 and ameliorated the effects of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 on eNOS expression and endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Simvastatin decreased miR-155 expression through interfering mevalonate-geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate-RhoA signaling pathway. These findings indicated that miR-155 is an essential regulator of eNOS expression and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. Inhibition of miR-155 may be a new therapeutic approach to improve endothelial dysfunction during the development of cardiovascular diseases.",

Irbesartan is reported to act as an antagonist of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) receptor, C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2). We examined the possible synergistic effects of the combination of irbesartan with rosuvastatin on preventing vascular remodeling focusing on the MCP-1/CCR2 pathway. We observed that administration of irbesartan and CCR2 antagonist, propagermanium, at noneffective doses, decreased the neointima with a decrease in PCNA labeling index in the injured mouse femoral artery induced by cuff placement. We also observed that administration of a noneffective dose of rosuvastatin with propagermanium decreased the neointima area, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of rosuvastatin on neointima formation is at least partly attributable to blockade of the MCP-1/CCR2 pathway. Moreover, we demonstrated that the combination of irbesartan with rosuvastatin decreased neointima formation. MCP-1 mRNA level was significantly increased in injured femoral arteries, and administration of irbesartan with rosuvastatin decreased the mRNA levels of MCP-1, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2, and increased PPAR\u03b3 mRNA expression.

The hearts from rats in each group were subjected to 30\u00a0min global ischaemia, followed by 120\u00a0min reperfusion. Infarct size, haemodynamics and Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression were examined. In hearts from diabetic rats, IPost did not limit infarct size or recover contractile dysfunction. Acute atorvastatin treatment with IPost limited infarct size and recovered contractile dysfunction in hearts from both diabetic and non-diabetic rats and further activated Akt and eNOS signalling pathways to enhance these protective effects in hearts from diabetic rats. Chronic statin treatment with IPost neither reduced infarct size nor increased recovery of myocardial dysfunction in hearts from both diabetic and non-diabetic rats; this may be associated with inhibition of Akt and eNOS phosphorylation. The combination of acute atorvastatin treatment with IPost had a greater protective effect within hearts from diabetic rats, but chronic statin treatment with IPost failed to protect against reperfusion injury in hearts from either diabetic or non-diabetic rats.

    "176": "Statin therapy decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates when used as either primary or secondary prevention. An immunomodulating effect of statins has been suggested. Incontrovertible evidence of accelerated atheroma has been obtained in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Routine statin therapy in SLE patients might therefore produce both cardiovascular and immunological benefits. However, routine statin therapy is inappropriate in SLE patients, the main reason being the absence of a vast interventional study done specifically in this population. An immunomodulating role for statins in SLE has not been convincingly established. The effect of statin therapy on markers for subclinical atheroma (intima-media thickness changes over time) is unclear, and there are no studies proving that statins are effective when used for primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention. Nevertheless, we believe that a serum lipid profile should be obtained once a year in all SLE patients. There is a sound rationale for classifying all SLE patients as being at high cardiovascular risk and those receiving secondary prevention as at very high risk. Consequently, the serum LDL-cholesterol level must be kept below 100 mg/dL and 70 mg/dL in these two populations, respectively. Statins are the only widely recommended drugs for achieving these treatment targets. Statin therapy requires specific monitoring precautions (transaminase levels) given the high prevalence of comorbidities and use of concomitant medications in SLE patients.", 
    "177": "Recent studies have shown that rosuvastatin significantly decreases serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and slows progression of carotid atherosclerosis in the general population. However, there are no data about its effect on progression of atherosclerosis in HIV-infected patients. Adult patients with HIV infection, on stable antiretroviral therapy, with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia, who started a rosuvastatin treatment at 10 mg daily during the period 2007-2009 were enrolled and followed-up for 24 months. Thirty-six patients (30 males) were enrolled, with a mean age of 49 years, a mean duration of current antiretroviral therapy of 38 months, and a mean 10-year risk of myocardial infarction of 18.5%. Rosuvastatin led to a significant decrease in mean values of intima-media thickness in all extracranial carotid arteries, with the greatest magnitude observed in carotid bifurcations (a mean decrease of 18.7% in the right artery and of 21.4% in the left artery) and in internal carotid arteries (a mean decrease of 23.7% in the right artery and of 25.6% in the left artery). Moreover, there was a significant reduction in mean levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides versus respective baseline values associated with a significantly decreased mean cardiovascular risk. The treatment with rosuvastatin was well tolerated, and serious adverse events were not reported. A 24-month treatment with rosuvastatin in HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with subclinical atherosclerosis and a moderate cardiovascular risk seems to promote significantly favorable changes in carotid atherosclerosis, associated with a favorable effect on serum lipid levels and a good tolerability profile.", 
    "178": "Statins are the most commonly used drugs in patients with dyslipidemia. Among the patients, a significant inter-individual variability with supposed strong genetic background in statin treatment efficacy has been observed. Genome wide screenings detected variants within the CELSR2/PSRC1/SORT1, CILP2/PBX4, APOB, APOE/C1/C4, HMGCoA reductase, LDL receptor and PCSK9 genes that are among the candidates potentially modifying response to statins. Ten variants (SNPs) within these genes (rs599838, rs646776, rs16996148, rs693, rs515135, rs4420638, rs12654264, rs6511720, rs6235, rs11206510) were analyzed in 895 (46 % men, average age 60.3+/-13.1 years) patients with dyslipidemia treated with equipotent doses of statins (~90 % on simvastatin or atorvastatin, doses 10 or 20 mg) and selected 672 normolipidemic controls (40 % men, average age 46.5 years). Lipid parameters were available prior to the treatment and after 12 weeks of therapy. Statin treatment resulted in a significant decrease of both total cholesterol (7.00+/-1.53-->5.15+/-1.17 mmol/l, P<0.0001) and triglycerides (2.03+/-1.01-->1.65+/-1.23 mmol/l, P<0.0005). Rs599838 variant was not detected in first analyzed 284 patients. After adjustment for multiple testing, there was no significant association between individual SNPs and statin treatment efficacy. Only the rs4420638 (APOE/C1/C4 gene cluster) G allele carriers seem to show more profitable change of HDL cholesterol (P=0.007 without and P=0.06 after adjustment). Results demonstrated that, although associated with plasma TC and LDL cholesterol per se, variants within the CELSR2/PSRC1/SORT1, CILP2/PBX4, APOB, APOE/C1/C4, HMGCoA reductase, LDL receptor and PCSK9 genes do not modify therapeutic response to statins.",

    "180": "Contrast media- (CM-) induced nephropathy is a serious complication of radiodiagnostic procedures. Available data suggests that the development of prophylaxis strategies is limited by poor understanding of pathophysiology of CM-induced nephropathy. Present study was designed to determine the role of oxidative stress, myeloperoxidase, and nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of iohexol model of nephropathy and its modification with simvastatin (SSTN). Adult Sprague Dawley rats were divided into seven groups. After 24 h of water deprivation, all the rats except in control and SSTN-only groups were injected (10 ml/kg) with 25% glycerol. After 30 min, SSTN (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) was administered orally, daily for 4 days. Twenty-four hours after the glycerol injection, iohexol was infused (8 ml/kg) through femoral vein over a period of 2 min. All the animals were sacrificed on day 5 and blood and kidneys were collected for biochemical and histological studies. The results showed that SSTN dose dependently attenuated CM-induced rise of creatinine, urea, and structural abnormalities suggesting its nephroprotective effect. A significant increase in oxidative stress (increased lipid hydroperoxides and reduced glutathione levels) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and decreased nitric oxide in CM group were reversed by SSTN. These findings support the use of SSTN to combat CM-induced nephrotoxicity.", 
    "181": "A recent explosion in the amount of cardiovascular risk has swept across the globe. Primary prevention is the preferred method to lower cardiovascular risk. Lowering the prevalence of obesity is the most urgent matter, and is pleiotropic since it affects blood pressure, lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, inflammation, and atherothrombotic disease progression. Given the current obstacles, success of primary prevention remains uncertain. At the same time, the consequences of delay and inaction will inevitably be disastrous, and the sense of urgency mounts. Pathological and epidemiological data confirm that atherosclerosis begins in early childhood, and advances seamlessly and inexorably throughout life. Risk factors in childhood are similar to those in adults, and track between stages of life. When indicated, aggressive treatment should begin at the earliest indication, and be continued for many years. For those patients at intermediate risk according to global risk scores, C-reactive protein, coronary artery calcium, and carotid intima-media thickness are available for further stratification. Using statins for primary prevention is recommended by guidelines, is prevalent, but remains under prescribed. Statin drugs are unrivaled, evidence-based, major weapons to lower cardiovascular risk. Even when low density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are attained, over half of patients continue to have disease progression and clinical events. Though clinical evidence is incomplete, altering or raising the blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol level continues to be pursued. The aim of this review is to point out the attention of key aspects of vulnerable plaques regarding their pathogenesis and treatment.", 
    "182": "Although the cholesterol-heart hypothesis is often regarded as a dogmatic belief, controversy continues to surround the aetiology and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In fact, lowering cholesterol with statin drugs has been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, statins have pleiotropic effects independent of their capacity to lower cholesterol. We highlight that statin drugs exert an important action on iron metabolism, which in turn may prevent progression and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque. If it is found that the effect of statins on iron metabolism is a mechanism of their beneficial action, this consequence of statin use can be clinically replicated by other methods, such as controlled reduction of body iron stores. This might allow the use of lower doses or even obviate the use of statins in primary cardiovascular prevention, and therefore avoid the side effects and expense of these drugs.", 
    "183": "Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) often represents a devastating event despite maximal therapeutic efforts. Statins are drugs primarily used as cholesterol reducers with several pleiotropic effects that may result in neuroprotection. In this study, we assessed the continued use of statins after acute ICH. From January 2008 to October 2010, we analyzed a retrospective cohort of 178 patients with acute ICH. Patients with head injury, cerebral tumors, hemorrhage after ischemic stroke, and having a National Institute Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of greater than 30 points on admission were excluded. In 29 patients, statins were continued within the first 24\u00a0h after onset of ICH and, subsequently, given daily until discharge, whereas 149 nonusers were used as controls. Inpatient mortality, NIHSS, and Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at discharge as well as mortality after 10\u00a0days, 3\u00a0months, and 6\u00a0months were recorded as outcomes. Additionally, changes of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) counts, as well as aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were assessed. Except for the number of hypertensive and diabetic patients, characteristics on admission were similar between both groups. No mortality was observed in statin users, whereas 19 controls (12.7\u00a0%) died (p\u2009=\u20090.04) until discharge; after 10\u00a0days, 3\u00a0months, and 6\u00a0months, a similar trend was found. After 6\u00a0months, statin use was associated to lower mortality in regression models (OR\u2009=\u20090.32, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u20090.11-0.95, p\u2009=\u20090.04). In the same way, statin use was related to NIHSS reduction (-3.53, 95\u00a0% CI\u2009=\u2009-7.59 to 0.42, p\u2009=\u20090.07). In mixed models, changes of WBC counts and CRP levels were associated with statin use. The hepatic enzymes were similar between groups. The continued use of statins after ICH could be associated to early neurological improvement and may reduce mortality within 6\u00a0months. Immunomodulation as a pleiotropic effect of statins may represent one of the underlying mechanisms.", 
    "184": "Scientific advances in cardiovascular research during the last decades have afforded effective pharmacological treatment to those surviving their first acute myocardial infarction. This secondary prevention treatment, based upon the combined administration of statins, aspirin, beta-blockers and renin-angiotensin blockers, might avert great part of the relapses contributing substantially to the overall incidence of acute coronary syndromes in the general population. However, a treatment gap separates evidence-based recommendations from their daily clinical application, a condition frequently explored even in the Italian medical setting. However, a general overview of the problem is missing insofar, a contribution that might eventually help to improve the status of secondary coronary prevention in our national environment.",

Chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and increased platelet activation have been widely reported to be pathophysiological links between COPD and atherosclerosis. Statins and inhaled corticosteroids have been investigated as potential therapeutic interventions in COPD that may lower cardiovascular risk.

    "194": "Cardiovascular disease is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is the principle cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. In patients with stage 5 CKD, structural changes in the myocardium have been implicated as the principle cardiovascular processes leading to this increase in morbidity and mortality, while atherosclerotic events including acute myocardial infarction and strokes are responsible for approximately 10-15% of cardiovascular deaths. Dyslipidemia is common in CKD patients and is usually not characterized by elevated cholesterol levels, except in patients with marked proteinuria. Increased triglyceride levels in conjunction with decreased high-density lipoprotein levels are the commonest qualitative abnormality. Characteristically, abnormalities in the metabolism of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins have been described, including both gut derived (apoB-48) as well as those produced by hepatic synthesis (apoB-100). A decrease in enzymatic delipidation as well as reduced receptor removal of these lipoproteins both contribute to the increased levels of these apo-B-containing particles and their remnants (which are believed to be highly atherogenic). Abnormalities in the metabolism of apoA-containing lipoproteins are also present and these changes contribute to the lower levels of HDL seen. Qualitative abnormalities of these HDL particles may be associated with cellular oxidative injury and contribute to a pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic milieu that is frequently present in CKD patients.", 
    "195": "Diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular disease; however, this risk is further increased as a result of other factors. This observation is particularly relevant with regard to lipid abnormalities. Although diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol, and small dense LDL particles, the main determinant of the role of dyslipidemia in the prognosis of diabetics is LDL cholesterol. In recent years, LDL cholesterol targets have become progressively lower, and most current recommendations establish an LDL cholesterol target of <70 mg/dL for diabetics. This target can only be achieved using potent statins at adequate doses. Although it has been suggested that statins may interfere with glycemic metabolism, the benefits of reducing LDL cholesterol by statins are much greater than this possible deleterious effect. Rosuvastatin is one of the most potent statins available. Several studies have shown that it effectively reduces LDL cholesterol to recommended targets in diabetics. Moreover, rosuvastatin modestly increases HDL cholesterol and decreases triglycerides. The risk of side effects is low, as is the risk of interactions with other drugs. In this manuscript, the efficacy and safety profile of rosuvastatin in diabetic population is reviewed.", 
    "196": "Amniotic fluid is a complex mixture composed of water, salts and different cells types derived from embryo exfoliation. Some of these cells present similar characteristics to mesenchymal stem cells as adherent properties, typical surface antigens and differentiation capacity. These cells are called amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AFMSCs) and are easily obtained by amniocentesis, propagated in culture and differentiated in several cell types with specific inductions. In this study, we observe the ability of simvastatin, a 3-HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, to induce AFSMCs osteogenic differentiation. When AFSMCs were incubated with medium containing simvastatin, it was observed morphological changes, calcium deposits formation confirmed by Alizarin Red stain. Differentiated cells also expressed typical osteogenic genes, as osteopontin and osteocalcin. In conclusion, simvastatin could be used as an optional osteogenic induction agent for amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells.", 
    "197": "Statins are the most widely used drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In spite of their overall favorable safety profile, they do possess serious myotoxic potential, whose molecular origin has remained equivocal. Here, we demonstrate in cultivated myoblasts and skeletal muscle cells that cerivastatin at nanomolar concentrations interferes with selenoprotein synthesis and evokes a heightened vulnerability of the cells toward oxidative stressors. A correspondingly increased vulnerability was found with atorvastatin, albeit at higher concentrations than with cerivastatin. In selenium-saturated cells, cerivastatin caused a largely indiscriminate suppression of selenoprotein biosynthesis and reduced the steady state-levels of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and selenoprotein N (SelN). Selenite, ebselen, and ubiquinone were unable to prevent the devitalizing effect of statin treatment, despite the fact that the cellular baseline resistance against tert-butyl hydroperoxide was significantly increased by picomolar sodium selenite. Mevalonic acid, in contrast, entirely prevented the statin-induced decrease in peroxide resistance. These results indicate that muscle cells may be particularly susceptible to a statin-induced suppression of essential antioxidant selenoproteins, which provides an explanation for the disposition of these drugs to evoke adverse muscular side-effects.", 
    "198": "The impact on cardiovascular events achieved by statin therapy seems to be mostly attributable to their cholesterol- lowering effect, with a highly debated contribution of the lipid-independent pleiotropic effects. Statins have an established role in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia with a clear and robust reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, the pathophysiologic effect of statins on inflammatory responses and local atherosclerotic plaque morphology in humans remains a matter of debate. In particular, the question remains whether statin-induced alterations in plaque composition can be ascribed mainly to low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering or an antiinflammatory pleiotropic effect, or both. This review summarizes the available evidence of the effects of statins on carotid plaque cellular composition in clinical settings, focusing on lipid-related and lipid-independent effects of statin therapy. A systematic review of the web online databases was performed. Studies in humans evaluating the effect of statins on composition of carotid plaque removed at endarterectomy were eligible for inclusion. Data support the view that plaque composition even after a short-term lipid lowering therapy is significantly modulated by the degree of LDL-C lowering. A contribution of LDL-C independent, anti-inflammatory mechanisms of statins on plaque stability is only suggested by some of the studies. Actually, data strongly support the current guidelines based on progressively lower LDL-C targets depending upon the cardiovascular risk of individual patients.", 
    "199": "Stimuli activating vascular smooth muscle cell death can constrain the neointimal response to arterial damage and prevent vascular thickening. Conversely, endothelial cell death increases endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis risk. We investigated the combined effect of atorvastatin and TNF-\u03b1 on vascular cell death.", 
    "200": "Cell death was investigated in cultures of human aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Atorvastatin downregulated NF-\u03baB and enhanced JNK activity and cell death in VSMC cultured with TNF- \u03b1. In the absence of TNF-\u03b1, percentages (mean and StDev) of annexin V positive cells were 17.4 \u00b1 6.6%, 19.3 \u00b1 5.9%, 22.9 \u00b1 9.4% and 35.0 \u00b1 20.0 % with 0, 1, 3 and 10 \u00b5M atorvastatin, respectively. The cytotoxic effect of statin was significant at the highest dose of 10 \u03bcM (p=0.001). In the presence of TNF-\u03b1, percentages of annexin V positive cells were 27.1 \u00b1 10.6%, 34.2 \u00b1 8.5%, 37.4 \u00b1 14.6, and 54.1 \u00b1 20.0% with 0, 1, 3 and 10 \u00b5M atorvastatin, respectively. The cytotoxic effect of statin was significant at each dose used (p\u22640.02), in the presence of TNF-\u03b1. The cell death sensitising effect of atorvastatin was apparently mediated by down modulation of PKC\u03b2 activity, because it was reproduced by the specific PKC\u03b2 inhibitor LY317615 and prevented by the PKC activator phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). This effect was cell context dependent because it was not observed in HUVECs. PKC\u03b2 was found to be constitutively active in VSMCs but not in HUVECs, thereby explaining the differential effect among the two cell types. Measurement of phosphoPKC\u03b2 protein levels in arterial specimens confirmed increased activation of this kinase in the smooth muscle layer, in comparison with endothelium. We show that PKC\u03b2 provides survival signals to vascular smooth muscle cells and not the endothelium.",

    "202": "Statin prevents atherosclerotic progression and helps to stabilize the plaque. According to a recent study, statin reduces inflammation in blood vessels. However, it has not been demonstrated to have any anti-inflammation reaction in patients who have been diagnosed as having a triple-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "203": "This study included a total of thirty (30) patients who had been diagnosed by coronary angiogram as having a triple-vessel CAD. Patients who already had been taking statin were given doubled dosage. An interview, physical examination and blood test were performed at the beginning of this study and three months later.", 
    "204": "After doubling the dose of statin, there was no statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, (increase in) high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglyceride in the blood test. C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant, significantly decreased from 0.34 mg/dL at the beginning of the study to 0.12 mg/dL at the end of study (p<0.01). The interleukin-6 concentration also significantly decreased from 8.55 pg/dL to 4.81 pg/dL (p<0.001). No major cardiovascular events occurred and the dosage regimen was not modified during the close observation period. There was no difference in the symptoms of angina pectoris, established by World Health Organization Angina Questionnaires, before and after the dose increase. Liver enzymes remained within normal range with no significant increase before and after conducting this study.", 
    "205": "Doubling the dose of statin alone significantly lowers pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration, which is closely related to the potential acute coronary syndrome, and CRP, a marker of vascular inflammation.", 
    "206": "Recently it has been shown that statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) at low doses express beneficial pleiotropic vascular effects. We aimed to explore whether these drugs at low doses induce the expression of vasoactive-related genes. Sixty adult Wistar rats were treated with low-dose atorvastatin (2 mg/kg), low-dose losartan (5 mg/kg), their combination or saline daily for 4, 6, or 8 weeks. Expression of the vasoactive-related genes endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), endothelial nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), and angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTRL1a) was measured in isolated thoracic aortas. Expression of EDNRA gradually decreased, the lowest values being obtained after 8 weeks (low-dose atorvastatin, losartan [1.6- and 1-7-fold vs controls, respectively; both P < .05], and the combination [2.3-fold vs control, P < .001]). The highest values of NOS3 were obtained after 6 weeks (low-dose atorvastatin, losartan, and their combination, 3.1-fold, P < .01; 3.4-fold, P < .001; and 3.6-fold, P < .001 vs controls, respectively) and then declined after 8 weeks. The combination was more effective in inducing total NOS3 expression when compared to the separate drugs (1.4-fold; P < .05). Importantly, expression of NOS3 was associated with increased plasma NO levels and positively correlated with thoracic aorta relaxation. No changes in expression of NOS2 and AGTRL1a were observed. We showed that low-dose atorvastatin or losartan and especially their combination increases the expression of NOS3 and decreases the expression of EDNRA. These findings are valuable in explaining the effectiveness of the \"low-dose pharmacological approach\" for improvement in arterial function."
