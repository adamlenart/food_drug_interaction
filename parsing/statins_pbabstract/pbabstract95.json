Twenty male patients of CHD with different CYP3A4*1G genotypes were orally administered a single 20\u2009mg dose of atorvastatin. Plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and 2-hydroxyatorvastatin were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0-\u221e ) of atorvastatin in subjects with the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype were 36% or 25% lower than in those with the wild-type or the *1/*1G genotype, respectively. The time to peak plasma concentration (Tmax ) and oral clearance of atorvastatin (CL/F) were significantly different between subjects with the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype and the wild-type. The AUC0-\u221e for 2-hydroxyatorvastatin in subjects with the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype was 44% or 31% lower than in those with the wild-type or the *1/*1G genotype, respectively. The peak plasma concentration, Tmax and apparent clearance of 2-hydroxyatorvastatin (CL/Fm) were significantly different between subjects with the CYP3A4*1G/*1G genotype and the wild-type. This study indicates that the CYP3A4*1G allele is associated with the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and its metabolites in those Chinese Han patients with CHD after a single oral dose.",

At the beginning of the Biochemistry course for Physician Assistants, a team-based assignment was designed to develop an understanding of the mechanism of action, effectiveness, and toxicity of five common over the counter (OTC) drugs and dietary supplements, and place these familiar medicines in a political and historical context. The objectives of this exercise were to stimulate interest in biochemistry; to provide basic information on enzymes and enzyme inhibitors related to these drugs to be expanded upon later in the course; and to encourage active and interactive learning. Teams of five students were formed, and each student was given an information sheet on aspirin, alpha-galactosidase, orlistat, dextromethorphan, or simvastatin, a low dose statin, which was previously available without prescription at pharmacies in the UK. After each member of the team acquired information on one OTC drug/dietary supplement by reading an assigned information sheet, the team was asked to go through a series of questions, and then submit answers to a quiz as a group. A high rate of success on the quiz, an overwhelmingly positive response on formal course evaluations, and enthusiastic exchanges during class suggested this team-based session accomplished its goals.",

Several efforts have been made to reduce drug-induced nephrotoxicity; however, DIN remains a matter of concern. Statins with their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects may have the potential to protect kidney against DIN. The present review evaluated all of the available in vitro and in vivo studies that examined the use of statins as renoprotective agents against nephrotoxic drugs. Materials for this review were obtained by searching Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews. Key words used as search terms included \"statin\", \"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, \"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors\", \"nephroprotective\", \"renoprotective\", \"drug-induced renal diseases\", \"drug-induced nephrotoxicity\", \"drug-induced renal toxicity\", \"drug-induced nephropathy\", \"drug-induced renal side effects\", and \"contrast-induced nephropathy\". This search was performed without time limitation. Only English language articles were included in this review. This review concluded that chronic statin user may be less prone to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) compared with statin non-users. Short-term high dose statin administration may also reduce the incidence of CIN in statin na\u00efve patients. This renoprotective effect of statins against CIN is seen in low risk patients with normal kidney function or mild kidney dysfunction, but probably not in patients with moderate to severe renal dysfunction. Based on available animal data, statins may protect kidney against gentamicin-, cisplatin- and cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity, however, theses animal results have not yet been confirmed by human data.

    "41": "Ezetimibe is a unique inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe selectively inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption by blocking Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPCIL1). Ezetimibe accelerates VLDL and TG degradation. Therefore, ezetimibe ameliorates postprandial hyperlipidemia. Ezetimibe inhibited the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by correcting insulin resistance and decreasing small dense LDL-C in human subjects. In clinical study, ezetimibe administration combined with statin failed to inhibit progression of IMT thickness in ENHANCE (Ezetimibe and Simvastatin in Hypercholesterolemia Enhances Atherosclerosis Regression) study. In this study baseline IMT thickness (0.7 mm) of patients was within normal range. Therefore only two years observation was too short to demonstrate anti-atherogenic effects of ezetimibe. SEAS(Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis) trial examined effects of combination therapy with ezetimibe and statin in patients with aortic stenosis. Combination therapy could not inhibit progression of aortic stenosis. However, events of ischemic heart disease, especially CABG were significantly decreased only in combination group. Statin was not reported to reduce CVD(cardiovascular disease) in moderate to severe CKD patients. In SHARP(Study of Heart and Renal Protection) study, patients with severe renal disease were allocated either for statin alone group or combination therapy group with statin and ezetimibe. Combination therapy significantly decreased non-hemorrhagic stroke by 25 % compared with statin alone group in severe CKD and HD(hemodialysis) patients. Ezetimibe has unique lipid lowering profile increasing HDL-C concomitant with decreasing LDL-C and TG. Ezetimibe should be initiated first in patients with insulin resistant metabolic syndrome. Ezetimibe should be combined with statin to reduce not only LDL-C but RLP-C(remnant like lipoprotein particle choletserol) in type IIb dyslipidemia.", 
    "42": "LDL-cholesterol lowering by statins substantially reduces morbidity and mortality of coronary heart disease (CHD) and ischemic stroke. Statins are the most potent agents for lowering circulating LDL particles. Accumulation of triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins in both fasting and postprandial state is strongly associated with the formation of highly atherogenic small dense LDL. Although dose-dependent reductions in levels of atherogenic lipids are observed with all statin, strong statins such as rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and pitavastatin, can reduce the triglyceride and small dense LDL greater than other statins. Statin is one of the first-line drugs for management of hypertriglyceridemia with elevated LDL-cholesterol and/or non HDL-cholesterol. Aggressive LDL-cholesterol lowering may be required for the management of high-risk CHD patients with both high LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride.",

Studies indicate that the use of EPA and DHA lowered triglyceride levels, which is accomplished by decreasing the production of hepatic triglycerides and increasing the clearance of plasma triglycerides. Recent clinical studies showed that intake of omega-3 fatty acids reduced cardiovascular events. In addition, combination therapy with omega-3 fatty acids and a statin is a safe and effective way to improve lipid levels and cardiovascular prognosis beyond the benefits provided by statin therapy alone. Our focus is to review the potential mechanisms by which these fatty acids reduce cardiovascular disease risk.",

Accumulation of the further clinical evidence of a fibrates is expected.", 
    "45": "Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increase in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), chylomicron, intermediate density lipoprotein(IDL). Acquired hyperlipidemia results from various disorders, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, alcohol overuse, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, and some drugs like thiazide, -blocker, estrogen, etc. It is important to identify secondary causes underlying hypertriglyceridemia before initiating pharmacotherapy, since management of the causative disorders is the first-line therapy. Even if hyperlipidemia is not controlled after treating the underlying disorders, specific lipid -lowering therapy may be required in addition to lifestyle modification. Fibrate, nicotinic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid are utilized to reduce triglyceride levels. Statin and ezetimibe are utilized if non-high density lipoprotein(HDL)-cholesterol is elevated.", 
    "46": "Clinical studies have shown that statin use may alter the risk of lung cancer. However, these studies yielded different results. To quantify the association between statin use and risk of lung cancer, we performed a detailed meta-analysis. A literature search was carried out using MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE database between January 1966 and November 2012. Before meta-analysis, between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using adequate statistical tests. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were used to calculate the pooled relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis and cumulative meta-analysis were also performed. A total of 20 (five randomized controlled trials, eight cohorts, and seven case-control) studies contributed to the analysis. Pooled results indicated a non-significant decrease of total lung cancer risk among all statin users (RR = 0.89, 95% CI [0.78, 1.02]). Further, long-term statin use did not significantly decrease the risk of total lung cancer (RR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.39 , 1.64]). In our subgroup analyses, the results were not substantially affected by study design, participant ethnicity, or confounder adjustment. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of results. The findings of this meta-analysis suggested that there was no significant association between statin use and risk of lung cancer. More studies, especially randomized controlled trials and high quality cohort studies are warranted to confirm this association.",

The aim of the research was to estimate the efficacy and safety of cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors as novel lipid modifying drugs. Systematic searches of English literature for randomized controlled trials (RCT) were collected from MEDLINE, EBASE, CENTRAL and references listed in eligible studies. Two independent authors assessed the search results and only included the double-blind RCTs by using cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors as exclusively or co-administrated with statin therapy irrespective of gender in enrolled adult subjects. Two independent authors extracted the data by using predefined data fields. Of 503 studies identified, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, and 12 studies were included into the final meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis revealed that CETP inhibitors increased the HDL-c levels (n = 2826, p<0.00001, mean difference (MD) = 20.47, 95% CI [19.80 to 21.15]) and total cholesterol (n = 3423, p = 0.0002, MD = 3.57, 95%CI [1.69 to 5.44] to some extent combined with a reduction in triglyceride (n = 3739, p<0.00001, MD = -10.47, 95% CI [-11.91 to -9.03]) and LDL-c (n = 3159, p<0.00001, MD = -17.12, 95% CI [-18.87 to -15.36]) irrespective of mono-therapy or co-administration with statins. Subgroup analysis suggested that the lipid modifying effects varied according to the four currently available CETP inhibitors. CETP inhibitor therapy did not increase the adverse events when compared with control. However, we observed a slight increase in blood pressure (SBP, n = 2384, p<0.00001, MD = 2.73, 95% CI [2.14 to 3.31], DBP, n = 2384, p<0.00001, MD = 1.16, 95% CI [0.73 to 1.60]) after CETP inhibitor treatment, which were mainly ascribed to the torcetrapib treatment subgroup. CETP inhibitors therapy is associated with significant increase in HDL-c and decrease in triglyceride and LDL-c with satisfactory safety and tolerability in patients with dyslipidemia.

The rapid induction of MDR by xenobiotics in mammalian cells and PDR in budding yeast (S. cerevisiae) has been well studied but how pathway specificity is achieved across different structural classes of xenobiotics is not well understood. As a novel approach to this problem we investigated the genome-wide network of genes modulating the yeast PDR. Fluorescently-tagged ABC pumps Pdr5p-GFP and Yor1p-GFP were used as real-time reporters for the Pdr1p/Pdr3p controlled response. Using the yeast non-essential gene deletion set fifty-four gene deletions that suppressed up-regulation of reporter fluorescence to the cell surface in the presence of atorvastatin were identified by high content confocal automated microscopy. Secondary validation using spot dilution assays to known PDR substrates and Western blot assays of Pdr5p expression confirmed 26 genes able to modulate the PDR phenotype. By analysis of network connectivity, an additional 10 genes that fell below the primary screen cut-off were predicted to be involved in PDR and confirmed as above. The PDR modulating genes taken together were enriched in signalling (Rho-GTPase, MAPK), Mediator complexes, and chromatin modification (subunits of ADA and SAGA complexes). Many of the gene deletions cause extra sensitivity in \u0394pdr1\u0394pdr3 strains strongly suggesting that there are alternative pathways to upregulate PDR, independently of Pdr1p/Pdr3p. We present here the first high-content microscopy screening for PDR modulators, and identify genes that are previously unsuspected regulators of PDR apparently contributing via network interactions.",

Our review summarizes mechanisms of action, recent meta-analyses of CVD outcome trials, sources (fish and supplements), and recommendations for use of omega-3 FA in clinical practice. With the ability to now measure the omega-3 FA biostatus through blood tests, patients can achieve cardioprotective levels by either taking fish oil supplements or simply eating more oily fish. Two omega-3 FA formulations (both in the ethyl ester form) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with very high triglyceride levels (> 500 mg/dL); one contains both EPA and DHA, whereas the other contains only EPA. The agents have been extensively tested in 2 patient populations, those with very high triglycerides and those with triglycerides between 200 and 500 mg/dL while on background statin therapy. In general, treatment with EPA+DHA appears to lower patient triglycerides more effectively, but in those patients with very high triglyceride levels, use of EPA+DHA also raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, whereas EPA alone did not. Both formulations, at doses that do not lower triglycerides, have been shown to reduce CVD events in some, but not all, studies. Given the favorable risk-to-benefit ratio for these essentially nutritional agents, use is expected to continue to expand.", 
    "57": "A combination of statin and stem cell therapies has been shown to benefit in experimental models of myocardial infarction. This study tests whether treatment with simvastatin has a direct impact on the cardiomyogenic development of murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in embryoid bodies. In a concentration-dependent manner, simvastatin treatment enhanced expression of several promyogenic nuclear transcription factors, including GATA4, Nkx2.5, DTEF-1 and myocardin A. The statin-treated cells also displayed higher levels of cardiac proteins, including myosin, \u03b1-actinin, Ryanodine receptor-2, and atrial natriuretic peptide, and they developed synchronized contraction. The statin's promyogenic effect was partially diminished by the addition of the two isoprenoids FPP and GGPP, which are intermediates of cholesterol synthesis. Thus, simvastatin treatment enhances ESC myogenesis during early development perhaps via a mechanism inhibiting the mevalonate-FPP/GGPP pathway.",

Consistent with liver-specific humanization, only hepatic drug distribution was partially restored (1.3- to 6.5-fold increase vs. knockout). Exposure and liver distribution changes in OATP1B1-humanized versus knockout mice predicted the clinical impact of OATP1B1 on oral exposure and contribution to human hepatic uptake of statins within 1.7-fold, but only after correcting for human/humanized mouse liver relative protein expression factor (OATP1B1 = 2.2, OATP1B3 = 0.30).",

Furthermore, in vivo studies in osteoporotic mice using a drug loaded and chemically modified version of the biomimetic delivery system showed significant cortical and cancellous bone increases. These studies support the notion and the rationale for future research and development of the use of coral exoskeletons as materials for drug delivery applications.",

    "113": "This is a single-institution, retrospective cohort study of 106 patients who underwent lower extremity revascularization procedures involving femoral artery exposure through a groin incision at a tertiary referral hospital. The primary outcome was occurrence of SSI at the groin wound. The duration of hospital stay, reoperation within 30\u00a0days, discharge disposition, and 30-day mortality were also evaluated. Independent variables included patient demographics and operative variables (i.e., procedure type, transfusion requirements, preoperative antibiotics, intraoperative vasopressors, and operative duration). Statistical analysis included chi-squared tests, t-tests, and multivariable regression analysis.", 
    "114": "Of the 106 patients who underwent a lower extremity revascularization procedure with a groin incision for femoral artery exposure, 62% were male, and the mean age was 62\u00a0years. Comorbidities included hypertension (93%), dyslipidemia (65%), statin use (63%), active smoker (50%), diabetes (24%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (23%). All patients received preoperative antibiotics, 50% required intraoperative pressors, 21% received a blood transfusion, and the mean operative time was 296\u00a0min. The overall duration of stay was 10.7\u00a0days, the 30-day reoperation rate was 18%, and the 30-day mortality rate was 12%. Overall, 22% developed a seroma or hematoma, and 31% developed a SSI. Patients who developed an SSI compared with those who did not were more likely to have a postoperative seroma or hematoma (55% vs 5%) and to receive a blood transfusion (33% vs 15%), but less likely to be treated with a statin (47% vs 69%) or carry a diagnosis of dyslipidemia (50% vs 72%), respectively, all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Patients with an SSI had a longer duration of stay (14.5 vs 8.7\u00a0days) and a higher reoperative rate (49% vs 4%), but had a lower 30-day mortality (0% vs 18%) than those who did not develop an SSI (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). On multivariable regression analysis adjusting for differences in patient and operative variables, the occurrence of a wound seroma or hematoma remained an independent predictor for SSI (odd ratio: 27.6; 95% confidence interval: 5.4-139.6).", 
    "115": "The incidence of postoperative surgical site complications after lower extremity revascularization procedures involving a groin incision was 31% and was significantly associated with blood transfusion, postoperative seroma or hematoma, dyslipidemia, and statin usage. After adjusting for differences in patient and operative variables, postoperative seroma or hematoma was an independent predictor of SSI. Patients with a SSI have a longer duration of hospitalization and higher reoperative rate. Additional prospective cohort studies are warranted to delineate ways to decrease the rate of SSI.",

An aortic diameter \u22653.0\u00a0cm was defined as an AAA. Patient risk factors included age, body mass index, total cholesterol, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), statin use, and active smoking status; the presence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was also evaluated. Risk factors were compared in a multivariate analysis between patients with AAA and patients with a normal aorta.",

A total of 469 patients (7.6%) with AAA were identified. The following risk factors were significantly associated with a diagnosis of AAA: age >75\u00a0years (39.6% vs. 28.9%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), prevalence of CAD (43.1% vs. 28.5%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), COPD (26% vs. 11.4%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), PVD (37.3% vs. 7.7%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), eGFR <60\u00a0mL/min (36.7% vs. 24.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and current smoking (23.2% vs. 15.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

    "121": "Dyslipidemia represents one of the major risk factors for atherosclerosis affecting the arteries of large and medium caliber and consequently causing ischemia in the brain, heart, or legs. Coronary artery disease and cerebral stroke represent the major causes of morbidity and mortality among the elderly and middle aged subjects. The change of lifestyle can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease but available drug therapy (in particular statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) is effective in modifying hyperlipidemia and consequently reducing cardiovascular events. The hypolipemic drugs can prevent, slow the progression and sometimes determine the regression of atherosclerotic plaques, therefore significantly reducing the clinical complications of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In this review, we want to point out the role of the different lipoproteins, such as triglycerides, HDL-C, LDLC, Lp(a), in the pathogenesis of stroke and the role of statins in reducing both lipid fractions and stroke risk.", 
    "122": "Probucol and statin are often prescribed for treating atherosclerosis. These two drugs exhibit different mechanisms but it is unknown whether they have the same anti-atherogenic properties. In the current study, we examined whether these two drugs at optimal doses could inhibit the initiation of atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits in the same way.", 
    "123": "New Zealand White rabbits were fed a cholesterol-rich diet for 5 weeks to produce the early-stage lesions of atherosclerosis. Drug-treated rabbits were administered either probucol or atorvastatin and serum lipids and aortic atherosclerotic lesions were compared with those in a control group.", 
    "124": "Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced serum total cholesterol levels while probucol treatment led to significant reduction of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels without changing total cholesterol levels compared with those in the control group. Compared with the control, probucol treatment led to 65% (p\u2009<\u20090.01) reduction while atorvastatin treatment led to 23% (p\u2009=\u20090.426) reduction of the aortic lesion area. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the lesions of the probucol-treated group were characterized by remarkable reduction of monocyte adherence to endothelial cells and macrophage accumulation in the intima compared with those of both atorvastatin and control groups. Furthermore, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) isolated from the probucol group exhibited prominent anti-oxidative reaction, which was not present in LDL isolated from either the atorvastatin-treated or the control group.", 
    "125": "This study suggests that probucol inhibits the initiation of atherosclerosis by reducing monocyte adherence and infiltration into the subintima. Anti-oxidization of LDL by probucol protects more effectively against early-stage lesion formation than statin-mediated lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "126": "Valvular heart disease (VHD) represents a significant burden within the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases. In recent years, there has been a great interest in finding medical treatments able to slow the progression ofVHD. The negative results of several large randomized trials failing to demonstrate a benefit of such therapies, has led to a decrease of interest in this field. However, finding a medical treatment capable of preventing VHD progression is still a hot topic, due to the important clinical implications. We believe that the jury is still out on the debate about the role of statin therapy in VHD, considering also recently published studies providing new information with future implications for the treatment of this disease process. This article gives an overview of the published evidence about the role of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors on delaying progressive valve dysfunction. A preventive therapy, which could influence not only the haemodynamic progression of valve disease, but also the cardiovascular outcome, is warranted. Large, prospective, randomized trials are needed to properly evaluate the role of statins in the early stages of valvular heart disease.", 
    "127": "Tissue-specific deletion of the gene for NADPH-cytochrome P450 (P450) reductase (CPR), the essential electron donor to all microsomal P450 enzymes, in either liver or intestine, leads to upregulation of many P450 genes in the tissue with the Cpr deletion. Here, by studying the liver-specific Cpr-null (LCN) mouse, we examined whether an interorgan regulatory pathway exists, such that a loss of hepatic CPR would cause compensatory changes in intestinal P450 expression and capacity for first-pass metabolism of oral drugs. We show for the first time that intestinal expression of CYP2B, 2C, and 3A proteins was increased in LCN mice by 2- to 3-fold compared with wild-type (WT) mice, accompanied by significant increases in small intestinal microsomal lovastatin-hydroxylase activity and systemic clearance of oral lovastatin (at 5 mg/kg). Additional studies showed that the hepatic Cpr deletion, which caused large decreases in bile acid (BA) levels in the liver, intestine, plasma, and intestinal content, led to drastic decreases in the mRNA levels of intestinal fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), a target gene of the BA receptor farnesoid X receptor. Furthermore, treatment of mice with FGF19 (the human counterpart of mouse FGF15) abolished the difference between WT and LCN mice in small intestinal (SI) CYP3A levels at 6 hours after the treatment. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized direct role of intestinal FGF15/19 in the regulation of SI P450 expression and may have profound implications for the prediction of drug exposure in patients with compromised hepatic P450 function.", 
    "128": "To review the phase 1 and 2 trials with fully human monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 published in the last 18 months and provide comprehensive data that targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 very effectively reduces LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C).", 
    "129": "The trials studied a number of different populations including patients with LDL receptor defects (heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) and non-familial hypercholesterolemia, background statin or diet only treatment, and those intolerant to statins. The LDL-C lowering has been large, consistent and greater than the largest reductions achievable by the most efficacious statins. These subcutaneously administered drugs produce very rapid reductions in LDL-C, maximal in 7 days, with dosing frequency that may be every 2 or 4 weeks. Unexpected, consistent and robust reductions in Lp(a) have also been reported. Based on these short-term trials of 8-12 weeks in over 1500 patients the drugs have been very well tolerated and the emergent safety profile has not identified any specific areas of concern.", 
    "130": "Provided these compounds continue to exhibit an acceptable safety profile in ongoing phase 3 trials they will be as crucial to LDL-C control and reduction of cardiovascular disease, as statins.", 
    "131": "To provide an update on recent mechanistic and clinical trial data related to the actions and efficacy of niacin.", 
    "132": "Recent mechanistic studies have provided novel insights regarding the mechanism of action of niacin. Studies of the purported niacin receptor, GPR109A, indicate that niacin-mediated fatty acid-lowering and flushing are dependent on niacin binding to this receptor, whereas the lipid-altering effects of niacin may be independent of the interaction of niacin with the receptor. Two cardiovascular outcome trials - Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health trial and HPS2-THRIVE - were both negative.", 
    "133": "Niacin has been used to treat dyslipidemia for almost 60 years. Recent studies have provided clues to niacin's broad lipid-altering efficacy, but more work is required to fully understand its mechanisms of action. The failure of niacin to reduce cardiovascular events in two recent placebo-controlled trials of high-risk patients with LDL-cholesterol levels less than 70\u200amg/dl on statins was surprising based on prior outcome and surrogate studies. We await publication of subgroup analyses to allow full assessment of those trials. In the meantime, we should not forget that niacin is an effective LDL-cholesterol-lowering drug in patients with high LDL levels despite statin treatment.", 
    "134": "Colchicine treatment is associated with an autophagic vacuolar myopathy in human patients. The presumed mechanism of colchicine-induced myotoxicity is the destabilization of the microtubule system that leads to impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion and the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. Using the MTOR inhibitor rapamycin we augmented colchicine\u2019s myotoxic effect by increasing the autophagic flux; this resulted in an acute myopathy with muscle necrosis. In contrast to myonecrosis induced by cardiotoxin, myonecrosis induced by a combination of rapamycin and colchicine was associated with accumulation of autophagic substrates such as LC3-II and SQSTM1; as a result, autophagic vacuoles accumulated in the center of myofibers, where LC3-positive autophagosomes failed to colocalize with the lysosomal protein marker LAMP2. A similar pattern of central LC3 accumulation and myonecrosis is seen in human patients with colchicine myopathy, many of whom have been treated with statins (HMGCR/HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) in addition to colchicine. In mice, cotreatment with colchicine and simvastatin also led to muscle necrosis and LC3 accumulation, suggesting that, like rapamycin, simvastatin activates autophagy. Consistent with this, treatment of mice with four different statin medications enhanced autophagic flux in skeletal muscle in vivo. Polypharmacy is a known risk factor for toxic myopathies; our data suggest that some medication combinations may simultaneously activate upstream autophagy signaling pathways while inhibiting the degradation of these newly synthesized autophagosomes, resulting in myotoxicity.", 
    "135": "Premature babies are particularly vulnerable to brain injury. In this study we focus on cortical brain damage associated with long-term cognitive, behavioral, attentional or socialization deficits in children born preterm. Using a mouse model of preterm birth (PTB), we demonstrated that complement component C5a contributes to fetal cortical brain injury. Disruption of cortical dendritic and axonal cytoarchitecture was observed in PTB-mice. Fetuses deficient in C5aR (-/-) did not show cortical brain damage. Treatment with antibody anti-C5, that prevents generation of C5a, also prevented cortical fetal brain injury in PTB-mice. C5a also showed a detrimental effect on fetal cortical neuron development and survival in vitro. Increased glutamate release was observed in cortical neurons in culture exposed to C5a. Blockade of C5aR prevented glutamate increase and restored neurons dendritic and axonal growth and survival. Similarly, increased glutamate levels - measured by (1)HMRS - were observed in vivo in PTB-fetuses compared to age-matched controls. The blockade of glutamate receptors prevented C5a-induced abnormal growth and increased cell death in isolated fetal cortical neurons. Simvastatin and pravastatin prevented cortical fetal brain developmental and metabolic abnormalities -in vivo and in vitro. Neuroprotective effects of statins were mediated by Akt/PKB signaling pathways. This study shows that complement activation plays a crucial role in cortical fetal brain injury in PTL and suggests that complement inhibitors and statins might be good therapeutic options to improve neonatal outcomes in preterm birth.", 
    "136": "Recent analyses of large cohorts suggest that statins or aspirin may reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Due to their observational nature, these studies may have been flawed by confounding by indication or immortal time bias. Reviews of clinical trials conducted in the metabolic or cardiovascular domain showed no effect of statins on cancer of any type, but identified a 20% reduction of cancer with aspirin use. The effect of aspirin was concentrated to adenocarcinomas. More convincing evidence is needed to support the potential preventive effect of aspirin on HCC, but a clinical trial would be achievable in patients who are at high risk.",

Multiple data points including recipient and donor demographics, patient and graft outcomes, and early use of statins were collected.", 
    "139": "Sixty-eight patients underwent solitary pancreas transplantation within the study period. Eighteen patients (26%) were already on, or were prescribed, a statin at the time of hospital discharge; the 1-year death-censored graft survival was 81.25% for those that were on statins versus 72.9% for those without (P = NS). Excluding patients with early graft loss (<600 days) mean graft survival was 646 days longer for patients receiving statins (P = .02).",

Plasma concentrations of lipids, creatine kinase (CK), and aspartate transaminase (AST) were determined. Plasma concentrations of ezetimibe and ezetimibe glucuronide were measured in a second group of patients.",

No difference between 20-mg and 10-mg dosing was seen among patients not receiving statins. Plasma concentrations of ezetimibe and its active metabolite were about 2-fold higher (P < 0.05) in patients taking ezetimibe 20 mg than in those receiving 10 mg daily. All patients tolerated ezetimibe 20 mg without side effects.", 
    "144": "Ezetimibe 20 mg daily reduced total and LDL cholesterol further in patients receiving statin therapy compared with 10 mg daily. Prospective studies are required to show whether the higher plasma levels of ezetimibe and its active metabolite in patients taking the 20-mg dose have any detrimental effects. Increasing the ezetimibe dose to 20 mg daily might be an interesting potential approach for patients who fail to reach lipid targets on ezetimibe 10 mg daily along with maximally tolerated doses of statin.", 
    "145": "Elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a causal genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease. To determine if current evidence supports both screening and treatment for elevated Lp(a) in high-risk patients, an English-language search of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted. In population studies, there is a continuous association between Lp(a) concentrations and cardiovascular risk, with synergistic effects when low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is also elevated. Candidates for Lp(a) screening include patients with a personal or family history of premature cardiovascular disease, familial hypercholesterolemia, recurrent cardiovascular events, or inadequate LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) responses to statins. Given the comparative strength of clinical evidence, reducing LDL-C to the lowest attainable value with a high-potency statin should be the primary focus of lipid-modifying therapies. If the Lp(a) level is 30 mg/dL or higher in a patient who has the aforementioned characteristics plus residual LDL-C elevations (\u226570-100 mg/dL) despite maximum-potency statins or combination statin therapy, the clinician may consider adding niacin (up to 2 g/d). If, after these interventions, the patient has progressive coronary heart disease (CHD) or LDL-C levels of 160-200 mg/dL or higher, LDL apheresis should be contemplated. Although Lp(a) is a major causal risk factor for CHD, no currently available controlled studies have suggested that lowering it through either pharmacotherapy or LDL apheresis specifically and significantly reduces coronary risk. Further research is needed to (1) optimize management in order to reduce CHD risk associated with elevated Lp(a) and (2) determine what other intermediate- or high-risk groups might benefit from Lp(a) screening.",

    "151": "Human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), generated through Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transformation of B-lymphocytes (B-cells), are a commonly used model system for identifying genetic influences on human diseases and on drug responses. We have previously used LCLs to examine the cellular effects of genetic variants that modulate the efficacy of statins, the most prescribed class of cholesterol-lowering drugs used for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. However, statin-induced gene expression differences observed in LCLs may be influenced by their transformation, and thus differ from those observed in native B-cells. To assess this possibility, we prepared LCLs and purified B-cells from the same donors, and compared mRNA profiles after 24 h incubation with simvastatin (2 \u00b5m) or sham buffer. Genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were similarly regulated between the two cell types under both the statin and sham-treated conditions, and the statin-induced changes were significantly correlated. Genes whose expression differed between the native and transformed cells were primarily implicated in cell cycle, apoptosis and alternative splicing. We found that ChIP-seq signals for MYC and EBNA2 (an EBV transcriptional co-activator) were significantly enriched in the promoters of genes up-regulated in the LCLs compared with the B-cells, and could be involved in the regulation of cell cycle and alternative splicing. Taken together, the results support the use of LCLs for the study of statin effects on cholesterol metabolism, but suggest that drug effects on cell cycle, apoptosis and alternative splicing may be affected by EBV transformation. This dataset is now uploaded to GEO at the accession number GSE51444.",

It has been suggested that the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutarylcoenzyme-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor atorvastatin shows anticancer activity in prostate cancer cell lines. To this end, we analyzed the influence of atorvastatin on the cell adhesion and differentiation of CD133(+)CD44(+) cells derived from prostate cancer biopsies and peripheral blood. CD133(+)CD44(+) cells were treated with atorvastatin (16-64\u03bcM) for different time periods. Cell adhesion to endothelial cell monolayers and differentiation into prostate cancer cells were evaluated. \u03b11, \u03b21 and \u03b12\u03b21 integrins adhesion receptors and the downstream target of atorvastatin Rho-dependent kinase (ROCK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were analyzed by Western blot. Further blocking studies with the ROCK inhibitor H1152, anti-FAK antibody and anti-integrin \u03b11 and \u03b21 antibodies were carried out. Atorvastatin treatment inhibited dose-dependently cell attachment to endothelium and differentiation. The inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on cell adhesion was associated with decreased expression of integrins \u03b11 and \u03b21 and phosphorylated MYPT1 and FAK. Furthermore, atorvastatin strongly reduced ROCK1 and FAK mediated differentiation of CD133(+)CD44(+) cells, which was confirmed by antibody treatment. Atorvastatin modified the expression of cell adhesion molecules and differentiation markers. These beneficial effects of atorvastatin may be mediated by ROCK and FAK signaling pathway. The data presented may point to novel treatment options for prostate cancer.",

One of the major factors contributing to intolerance and non-compliance are the muscle side-effects, which range from mild myalgia through to severe life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. One way to address this is pharmacogenomic screening, which aims to individualize therapy to maximize efficacy whilst avoiding toxicity. Genes encoding proteins involved in the metabolism of statins as well as genes known to cause inherited muscle disorders have been investigated. To-date only polymorphisms in the SLCO1B1 gene, which encodes the protein responsible for hepatic uptake of statins, and the COQ2 gene, important in the synthesis of coenzyme Q10, have been validated as being strongly associated with statin-induced myopathy. The aim of this review is to summarize studies investigating genetic factors predisposing to statin myopathy and myalgia, as the first step towards pharmacogenomic screening to identify at risk individuals.",

No studies have examined whether a CRD provides additional benefit beyond that achieved by habitual statin use. We hypothesized that a CRD (<50 g carbohydrate/d) for 6 weeks would improve lipid profiles and insulin sensitivity, reduce blood pressure, decrease cellular adhesion and inflammatory biomarkers, and augment VEF (flow-mediated dilation and forearm blood flow) in statin users. Participants (n = 21; 59.3 \u00b1 9.3 y, 29.5 \u00b1 3.0 kg/m(2)) decreased total caloric intake by approximately 415 kcal at 6 weeks (P < .001). Daily nutrient intakes at baseline (46/36/17% carb/fat/pro) and averaged across the intervention (11/58/28% carb/fat/pro) demonstrated dietary compliance, with carbohydrate intake at baseline nearly 5-fold greater than during the intervention (P < .001). Compared to baseline, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased after 3 and 6 weeks (P < .01). Peak forearm blood flow, but not flow-mediated dilation, increased at week 6 compared to baseline and week 3 (P \u2264 .03). Serum triglyceride, insulin, soluble E-Selectin and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 decreased (P < .01) from baseline at week 3, and this effect was maintained at week 6. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that individuals undergoing statin therapy experience additional improvements in metabolic and vascular health from a 6 weeks CRD as evidenced by increased insulin sensitivity and resistance vessel endothelial function, and decreased blood pressure, triglycerides, and adhesion molecules.", 
    "160": "Several cardiovascular (CV) risk factors may explain the high rate of CV death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Among them both traditional and uremia-related risk factors are implicated and, moreover, the presence of kidney disease represents \"per se\" a multiplier of CV risk. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles are changed in quantitative, but above all in qualitative, structural, and functional ways, and lipoprotein metabolism is influenced by the progressive loss of renal function. Statin therapy significantly reduces cholesterol synthesis and both CV morbidity and mortality either directly, by reducing the lipid profile, or via pleiotropic effects; it is supposed to be able to reduce both the progression of CKD and also proteinuria. These observations derive from a post-hoc analysis of large trials conducted in the general population, but not in CKD patients. However, the recently published SHARP trial, including over 9200 patients, either on dialysis or pre-dialysis, showed that simvastatin plus ezetimibe, compared with placebo, was associated with a significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and a 17% reduction in major atherosclerotic events. However, no benefit was observed in overall survival nor in preserving renal function in patients treated. These recent data reinforce the conviction among nephrologists to consider their patients at high CV risk and that lipid lowering drugs such as statins may represent an important tool in reducing atheromatous coronary disease which, however, represents only a third of CV deaths in patients with CKD. Therefore, statins have no protective effect among the remaining two-thirds of patients who suffer from sudden cardiac death due to arrhythmia or heart failure, prevalent among CKD patients. The safety of statins is demonstrated in CKD by several trials and recently confirmed by the largest SHARP trial, in terms of no increase in cancer incidence, muscle pain, creatine kinase levels, severe rhabdomyolysis, hepatitis, gallstones and pancreatitis; thus confirming the handiness of statins in CKD patients. Here we will review the latest data available concerning the effectiveness and safety of statin therapy in CKD patients.",

In the T2D group, there were 24 patients with nephropathy, 34 with retinopathy, and 50 with peripheral neuropathy. Serum copper levels were significantly higher in IFG, IGT, and T2D groups. Serum zinc level was dramatically lower, and urinary zinc level was significantly higher in both T1D and T2D subjects compared with controls. The serum zinc/copper ratio was significantly lower in all the patients with IFG, ITG, T1D, and T2D. The serum copper level was positively associated with HbA1c in T2D subjects. Simvastatin treatment in T2D patients had no significant effect on serum and urinary copper and zinc.

    "162": "Residual risk, the ongoing appreciable risk of major cardiovascular events (MCVE) in statin-treated patients who have achieved evidence-based lipid goals, remains a concern among cardiologists. Factors that contribute to this continuing risk are atherogenic non-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and atherogenic processes unrelated to LDL cholesterol, including other risk factors, the inherent properties of statin drugs, and patient characteristics, ie, genetics and behaviors. In addition, providers, health care systems, the community, public policies, and the environment play a role. Major statin studies suggest an average 28% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 31% reduction in relative risk, leaving a residual risk of about 69%. Incomplete reductions in risk, and failure to improve conditions that create risk, may result in ongoing progression of atherosclerosis, with new and recurring lesions in original and distant culprit sites, remodeling, arrhythmias, rehospitalizations, invasive procedures, and terminal disability. As a result, identification of additional agents to reduce residual risk, particularly administered together with statin drugs, has been an ongoing quest. The current model of atherosclerosis involves many steps during which disease may progress independently of guideline-defined elevations in LDL cholesterol. Differences in genetic responsiveness to statin therapy, differences in ability of the endothelium to regenerate and repair, and differences in susceptibility to nonlipid risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, and molecular changes associated with obesity and diabetes, may all create residual risk. A large number of inflammatory and metabolic processes may also provide eventual therapeutic targets to lower residual risk. Classically, epidemiologic and other evidence suggested that raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol would be cardioprotective. When LDL cholesterol is aggressively lowered to targets, low HDL cholesterol levels are still inversely related to MCVE. The efflux capacity, or ability to relocate cholesterol out of macrophages, is believed to be a major antiatherogenic mechanism responsible for reduction in MCVE mediated in part by healthy HDL. HDL cholesterol is a complex molecule with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, antiplatelet, and vasodilatory properties, among which is protection of LDL from oxidation. HDL-associated paraoxonase-1 has a major effect on endothelial function. Further, HDL promotes endothelial repair and progenitor cell health, and supports production of nitric oxide. HDL from patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disease may fail to protect or even become proinflammatory or pro-oxidant. Mendelian randomization and other clinical studies in which raising HDL cholesterol has not been beneficial suggest that high plasma levels do not necessarily reduce cardiovascular risk. These data, coupled with extensive preclinical information about the functional heterogeneity of HDL, challenge the \"HDL hypothesis\", ie, raising HDL cholesterol per se will reduce MCVE. After the equivocal AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) study and withdrawal of two major cholesteryl ester transfer protein compounds, one for off-target adverse effects and the other for lack of efficacy, development continues for two other agents, ie, anacetrapib and evacetrapib, both of which lower LDL cholesterol substantially. The negative but controversial HPS2-THRIVE (the Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) trial casts further doubt on the HDL cholesterol hypothesis. The growing impression that HDL functionality, rather than abundance, is clinically important is supported by experimental evidence highlighting the conditional pleiotropic actions of HDL. Non-HDL cholesterol reflects the cholesterol in all atherogenic particles containing apolipoprotein B, and has outperformed LDL cholesterol as a lipid marker of cardiovascular risk and future mortality. In addition to including a measure of residual risk, the advantages of using non-HDL cholesterol as a primary lipid target are now compelling. Reinterpretation of data from the Treating to New Targets study suggests that better control of smoking, body weight, hypertension, and diabetes will help lower residual risk. Although much improved, control of risk factors other than LDL cholesterol currently remains inadequate due to shortfalls in compliance with guidelines and poor patient adherence. More efficient and greater use of proven simple therapies, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, combined with statin therapy, may be more fruitful in improving outcomes than using other complex therapies. Comprehensive, intensive, multimechanistic, global, and national programs using primordial, primary, and secondary prevention to lower the total level of cardiovascular risk are necessary.",

In situ and ex vivo NIRF imaging of the high-cholesterol diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions of apoE-/- mice (baseline) as well as ex vivo NIRF imaging in the progression and regression group (without or with atorvastatin treatment for another 8 weeks) were performed 24 h after an intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg of anti-oxLDL-NIR797, while phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used for the controls. The plaque areas were investigated using Oil Red O (ORO) staining. Aortas isolated from the apoE-/- mice 24 h post-injection exhibited a selective, strong, heterogeneous NIRF signal enhancement in the aortic root, arch, and bifurcation, whereas the PBS and competitive inhibition groups had limited NIRF signal changes (p < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between ORO staining and NIRF in the atherosclerotic aortas that received anti-oxLDL-NIR797. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed the colocalization of the oxLDL/macrophages and NIR797 fluorochromes. Furthermore, the atherosclerotic lesions of atorvastatin-treated mice showed reduced anti-oxLDL-NIR797 uptake and oxLDL expression.

To extend the understanding of conformational and thermodynamic preferences of Z-isomeric super-statin analogues, this study focused on analyzing pitavastatin and its lactonized derivatives via NMR spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. Z-isomeric pitavastatin analogues exist in solution as a pair of interconverting rotamers, where the Gibbs free energies between the major and minor rotamers are within 0.12 and 0.25 kcal mol-1 and the rotational energy barriers are between 15.0 and 15.9 kcal mol-1. The analysis of long-range coupling constants and ab initio calculations revealed that rotation across the C5'-C7 single bond is essential for generating a pair of atropisomers. The overall comparison of the results between Z-isomeric pitavastatin and rosuvastatin analogues demonstrated that the former are to some extent more flexible to attain numerous conformations.

    "207": "We conducted a phase II trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin administration for GVHD prophylaxis in both adult donors and recipients of matched sibling allogeneic HCT. Atorvastatin (40 mg per day orally) was administered to sibling donors, starting 14 to 28 days before the anticipated first day of stem-cell collection. In HCT recipients (n = 30), GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus, short-course methotrexate, and atorvastatin (40 mg per day orally).", 
    "208": "Atorvastatin administration in healthy donors and recipients was not associated with any grade 3 to 4 adverse events. Cumulative incidence rates of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD at days +100 and +180 were 3.3% (95% CI, 0.2% to 14.8%) and 11.1% (95% CI, 2.7% to 26.4%), respectively. One-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 52.3% (95% CI, 27.6% to 72.1%). Viral and fungal infections were infrequent. One-year cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality and relapse were 9.8% (95% CI, 1.4% to 28%) and 25.4% (95% CI, 10.9% to 42.9%), respectively. One-year overall survival and progression-free survival were 74% (95% CI, 58% to 96%) and 65% (95% CI, 48% to 87%), respectively. Compared with baseline, atorvastatin administration in sibling donors was associated with a trend toward increased mean plasma interleukin-10 concentrations (5.6 v 7.1 pg/mL; P = .06).", 
    "209": "A novel two-pronged strategy of atorvastatin administration in both donors and recipients of matched sibling allogeneic HCT seems to be a feasible, safe, and potentially effective strategy to prevent acute GVHD.", 
    "210": "Pre-clinical and epidemiologic studies provide rationale for evaluating lipophilic statins for breast cancer prevention. We conducted a single-arm, biomarker modulation trial of lovastatin among women with increased risk of breast cancer. Eligibility criteria included a deleterious germline mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, or TP53; lifetime breast cancer risk of \u226520\u00a0% as estimated by the Claus model; or personal history of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor-negative breast cancer. Participants received 40 mg of lovastatin orally twice daily for 6\u00a0months. We evaluated the following biomarkers before and after lovastatin use: breast duct cytology (primary endpoint), serum lipids, C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth factor-1, IGF binding protein-3, lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase genotype, and mammographic density. Thirty women were enrolled, and 26 (86.7\u00a0%) completed the study. For the primary endpoint of changes in breast duct cytology sampled by random periareolar fine needle aspiration, most participants [57.7\u00a0%, 95\u00a0% confidence interval (CI) 38.9-74.5\u00a0%] showed no change after lovastatin; 19.2\u00a0% (CI 8.1-38.3\u00a0%) had a favorable change in cytology, 7.7\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 1.0-25.3\u00a0%) had an unfavorable change, and 15.4\u00a0% (95\u00a0% CI 5.5-34.2\u00a0%) had equivocal results due to acellular specimens, usually after lovastatin. No significant changes were observed in secondary biomarker endpoints. The study was generally well-tolerated: 4 (13.3\u00a0%) participants did not complete the study, and one (3.8\u00a0%) required a dose reduction. This trial was technically feasible, but demonstrated no significant biomarker modulation; contributing factors may include insufficient sample size, drug dose and/or duration. The results are inconclusive and do not exclude a favorable effect on breast cancer risk.", 
    "211": "Garcinia atroviridis is a seasonal fruit plant found in many parts of South East Asia. The fruit rind is used in cooking and traditionally consumed for various reasons, including to lower blood cholesterol. A comparative study was undertaken to investigate the influence of extraction solvents and plant parts used on the lipid-lowering and antioxidant activities of Garcinia atroviridis.", 
    "212": "Aqueous extracts showed better antihyperlipidemic activity than the methanol extracts. Aqueous extract of ripe fruit showed the most potent antihyperlipidemic activity, comparable to that of atorvastatin. It significantly reduced the total cholesterol (P < 0.05), triglycerides (P < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein (P < 0.01), very-low-density lipoprotein (P < 0.01) and atherogenic index (P < 0.01). In contrast, antioxidant activities of methanol extracts of all parts of G. atroviridis were higher than their respective aqueous extracts, whereby the stem and leaves extracts showed better antioxidant activities than the fruits.", 
    "213": "Aqueous and methanol extracts of G. atroviridis showed higher antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant effects, respectively. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents showed significant correlations with antioxidant but not with antihyperlipidemic activities, indicating the involvement of other compounds. Contrary to the traditional belief, the present findings suggest that the fruit has higher antihyperlipidemic potential than the fruit rind.", 
    "214": "The article summarizes the recommendations of current European and American guidelines concerning the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease and carotid artery stenosis. In comparison to older recommendations, current guidelines concerning endovascular treatment and concomitant medical therapy have been changed in recent years. With the exception of very complex and long lesions, endovascular methods are seen as the therapy of choice for revascularization of the iliac and femoral arteries. For cardiovascular risk reduction, patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease and stenosis of the carotid arteries should receive antiplatelet as well as statin therapy and should not be treated different from patients with coronary artery disease."
