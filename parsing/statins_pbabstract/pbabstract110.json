Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but serious side effect that may lead to renal failure and dangerous electrolyte abnormalities in patients with decreased hepatic clearance of atorvastatin. We herein report the case of a patient with liver cirrhosis receiving atorvastatin therapy for ischemic heart disease and hyperlipidemia who developed rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure.", 
    "2": "Two major fractions (RLP-1 and RLP-2) were obtained by purifying the crude polysaccharides extracted from a traditional Chinese herb Rosae Laevigatae Fructus. The average molecular weight of RLP-1 and RLP-2 was 21.5 kDa and 16.1 kDa, respectively. Monosaccharide analysis indicated that RLP-1 was composed of xylose, mannose and galactose in the molar ratio of 1:11:8, while RLP-2 was only a glucan. Oral administration of RLP-1 could significantly decrease levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), inhibit hepatic lipid accumulation, increase antioxidant lipids and up-regulate expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in hyperlipidemia rats. These results suggest that RLP-1 improve hyperlipidemia possibly through regulating PPAR-mediated lipid metabolism. Therefore, could be explored as a possible agent for hyperlipidemia.",

Forty Wistar albino rats were categorized into four groups: sham operated (S), trauma (T), trauma + vehicle (T + V) and trauma + simvastatin (T + S). The T, T + V and T + S groups were subjected to TBI. The T + V group was administered vehicle [ethanol:saline (1/2)] and the T + S group was administered 1 mg/kg of simvastatin 3 h after the injury insult. Blood and brain tissue specimens were obtained 24 h after the trauma to measure VEGFs and NO levels and perform histopathological examinations. The histopathological injury scores of brain tissues were significantly higher in the T group, and simvastatin significantly prevented brain injury in the T + S group. In the T group, significant increases of VEGF levels in serum and brain tissues were noted, which were prevented with simvastatin treatment in the T + S group. The markedly high levels of NO in brain tissues of the T group were decreased by simvastatin treatment in the T + S group. It can be concluded that, as evidenced by histopathological findings, simvastatin treatment improves neuropathology in acute stages of TBI.", 
    "9": "The available studies have reported the benefits of statins on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. However studies in end-stage renal disease patients on dialysis yielded conflicting results. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis and provide the most reliable trial data to date on the impact of statin therapy on cardiovascular events and death from all causes in CKD patients. Data from PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus for the years 1966 to October 2012 were searched. The final meta-analysis included 11 randomized controlled trials involving 21,295 participants with CKD. Among them 6857 were on dialysis. The use of statins in subjects with non-dialysis-dependent CKD resulted in a marked reduction in death from all causes (relative risk [RR]: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.55-0.79; p<0.0001), cardiac causes (RR: 0.69; 95%CI: 0.55-0.68; p=0.0012), cardiovascular events (RR: 0.55; 95%CI: 0.4-0.75; p=0.0001) and stroke (RR: 0.66; 95%CI: 0.5-0.88; p=0.0022). The use of statins in dialysis-dependent CKD patients resulted in a non-significant effect on death from all causes (RR: 0.99; 95%CI: 0.88-1.11; p=0.85) and stroke (RR: 1.31; 95%CI: 0.9-1.89; p>0.05), but had the effect of reducing death from cardiac causes (RR: 0.79; 95%CI: 0.64-0.98; p<0.05) and cardiovascular events (RR: 0.81; 95%CI: 0.7-0.94; p<0.05). In conclusion, the use of statins should be indicated in cardiovascular disease prevention especially in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD. According to the very limited data the obtained results suggest caution in expecting a reduction in cardiovascular events in patients on dialysis.",

We examined the effects and mechanisms of chronic statin treatment on cardiac remodelling, e.g. fibrosis and diastolic properties.", 
    "11": "We used a mouse model deficient in leptin and the LDL-receptor (DKO) that reproduces this MS phenotype. DKO mice (12 weeks) were treated with rosuvastatin (R) for 6 months vs. placebo. Morphometric and echocardiographic measurements showed that R reduced cardiac mass and increased left-ventricular end-diastolic diameter despite unchanged cardiomyocyte dimensions. Similarly, R had no effect on the hypertrophic response to neurohormones in isolated cardiomyocytes. Conversely, R reversed the age-dependent development of MF as well as mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b21 and several pro-fibrotic markers (procollagen type I, its carboxy-terminal proteinase, Lysyl oxidase). R similarly inhibited the pro-fibrotic effects of TGF-\u03b21 on procollagen type I, alpha Smooth Muscle Actin expression and migratory properties of cardiac fibroblasts in vitro. In parallel, R increased the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a known inhibitor of fibrosis, in vivo and in vitro, and the anti-fibrotic effects of R were abrogated in fibroblasts transfected with AMPK\u03b11/\u03b12 siRNA. The reversal of MF by R in DKO mice was accompanied with improved diastolic properties assessed by P-V loop analysis (slope of EDPVR, dP/dt min and cardiac output).",

In this study, we found that spleen-derived dendritic cells (DCs) from the ongoing experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) rats can be induced into tolerogenic DCs by atorvastatin in vitro. Administration of these tolerogenic DCs to EAMG rats on days 5 and 13 post immunization (p.i.) resulted in improved clinical symptoms, which were associated with increased numbers of CD4(+)CD25(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells and Foxp3 expression, decreased lymphocyte proliferation among lymph node mononuclear cells (MNC), shifted cytokine profile from Th1/Th17 to Th2 type cytokines, decreased level of anti-R97-116 peptide (region 97-116 of the rat acetylcholine receptor \u03b1 subunit) IgG antibody in serum. These tolerogenic DCs can migrate to spleen, thymus, popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes after they were injected into the EAMG rats intraperitoneally. Furthermore, these tolerogenic DCs played their immunomodulatory effects in vivo mainly by decreased expression of CD86 and MHC class II on endogenous DCs. All these data provided us a new strategy to treat EAMG and even human myasthenia gravis (MG).", 
    "14": "We investigated the role of TRAF3 interacting protein 2 (TRAF3IP2), a redox-sensitive adapter protein and an upstream regulator of IKK and JNK in interleukin (IL)-18 induced smooth muscle cell migration, and the mechanism of its inhibition by simvastatin. The pleiotropic cytokine IL-18 induced human coronary artery SMC migration through the induction of TRAF3IP2. IL-18 induced Nox1-dependent ROS generation, TRAF3IP2 expression, and IKK/NF-\u03baB and JNK/AP-1 activation. IL-18 induced its own expression and that of its receptor subunit IL-18R\u03b1. Using co-IP/IB and GST pull-down assays, we show for the first time that the subunits of the IL-18R heterodimer physically associate with Nox1 under basal conditions, and IL-18 appears to enhance their binding. Importantly, the HMG-coA reductase inhibitor simvastatin attenuated IL-18-induced TRAF3IP2 induction. These inhibitory effects were reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), but not by farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP). Interestingly, simvastatin, GGPP, FPP, or Rac1 inhibition did not modulate ectopically expressed TRAF3IP2. These results demonstrate that the promigratory effects of IL-18 are mediated through TRAF3IP2 in a redox-sensitive manner, and this may involve IL-18R/Nox1 physical association. Further, Simvastatin inhibits inducible, but not ectopically-xpressed TRAF3IP2. Targeting TRAF3IP2 may blunt progression of hyperplastic vascular diseases in vivo.",

Patients with ASTEMI who had a lipid profile tested within 24 hours of symptom onset were enrolled. They were stratified into high and low LDL-C groups according to whether their LDL-C was above (n\u00a0=\u00a0501) or below (n\u00a0=\u00a0575) the median level, respectively. The incidence of MACE, cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, revascularization, and stroke was compared between the groups at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. Survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard analysis were performed. In-hospital use of beta blockers was better in the high than in the low LDL-C group (76.6% vs. 69.7%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Statin use was significantly higher in the high than in the low LDL-C group during follow-up (86.8% vs. 80.0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003 at1 month; 71.6% vs. 62.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 at 6 months; 67.8% vs. 61.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03 at 1 year). The incidence of MACE on follow-up at 1 month was higher in the low than in the high LDL-C group (12.0% vs. 8.1%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). At 1 year, survival was not significantly different between the groups. Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated that the incidence of MACE was significantly associated with hypertension, current smoking, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), in-hospital use of beta blockers, and statin use on follow-up (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). LDL-C levels on admission in patients with ASTEMI had no significant effect on the 6-month and 1-year incidence of MACE, but the incidence of MACE was significantly higher in the low LDL-C group at 1 month. It would be relevant to further investigate the HDL-C level on admission, in-hospital use of beta blockers, and statin use during follow-up in relation to MACE.", 
    "16": "Management of skin avulsion with tissue exposure is a challenge for plastic surgeons. Clinical observations have suggested that longer survival of skin flap prevents further contamination and infection. Less well known is the role of atorvastatin in avulsion skin flap. Therefore, we attempted to determine whether atorvastatin could alleviate avulsion skin flap in a rat model. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into two groups: the atorvastatin group and the control. Before operation, each rat received an initial blood perfusion scan as baseline data. Then, each rat received an operation of skin flap incision, elevation, and resuturing to the original position under general anesthesia. Another blood perfusion scan was performed on each rat 30 minutes, 4 days, and 7 days postoperatively. On the 7th postoperative day, the necrotic area of skin flap was measured as the skin flap viability. The skin flap tissues at 2.5 and 5cm distal to the skin flap base were collected for histopathological analysis, as well as measurement of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA expression, and vascular density. Compared with 30 minutes postoperation, there was a significant increase in the ratio of skin flap blood perfusion on the 4th and 7th days postoperation in both control and atorvastatin groups (p<0.05). Compared with the control group, there was a significant decrease in\u00a0necrotic area, significant increase in ratio of skin flap blood perfusion on postoperation days 4 and 7, and significant increase in vascular density under high field at 2.5cm distal to the base of skin flap in the atorvastatin group (p<0.05). The VEGF121 and VEGF165 mRNA expression at 2.5cm distal to the base of skin flap differed significantly between the two groups (p<0.05). Compared with the control group, atorvastatin treatment improved skin flap blood perfusion, vascular density, and necrotic area dependent on VEGF mRNA expression.",

Often, older cancer patients are taking multiple pharmacotherapy agents for the treatment or prevention of cardiac disease when they face decisions about cancer treatment. Concurrent administration of drugs can result either in increased toxicity or decreased efficacy of either therapy. The benefits of the cardiac medications must be weighed against the effects of cancer therapy, and the role of drug metabolism also must be considered. For example, the benefits of cardiac medications such as anti-platelet agents, important in treating coronary artery disease, and anti-thrombotic agents, important for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, must be evaluated against an increased risk of bleeding during cancer therapy. It should be noted that some cardiac medications which act on hormonal receptors can theoretically stimulate growth of certain cancers. The concomitant management of cardiac therapy and cancer therapy is a common challenge in today's aging population.", 
    "24": "Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors that act on the mevalonate pathway and inhibit synthesis of cholesterol, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). In preclinical studies, these agents have been shown to inhibit proliferation, trigger apoptosis and promote cell differentiation of leukemia. Proposed mechanisms include cholesterol deprivation and inhibition of isoprenylation of important signaling molecules. Case reports and early clinical studies suggest a therapeutic potential for statins in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the other leukemias there are limited clinical data, but in vitro studies provide a strong rationale for future studies involving statins. The effects of statins on the immune system may lend these agents to a role in allogeneic stem cell transplant. While many of the studies are early, statins have the future potential to be integrated into conventional chemotherapy regimens with limited side effects.",

The level of atherogenic LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is directly related to an increased risk of occurrence and progression of ischemic heart disease. Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that the use of statin therapy to decrease LDL-C can significantly reduce the incidence of mortality, major coronary events and the need for revascularization procedures in the different groups of patients. The findings of a large meta-analysis conducted by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) collaborators showed that every 1.0 mmol/l reduction of atherogenic LDL-C is associated with a 22% reduction in cardiovascular diseases mortality and morbidity. However, despite the impressive results of the benefits of statin therapy, the EUROASPIRE study showed that about 50% of patients with ischemic heart disease did not achieve target LDL-C levels. According to the new ESC/EAS Guidelines for the Management of Dyslipidaemias in patients with a very high cardiovascular risk, treatment goal should be to decrease LDL-C below 1.8 mmol/l or > or = 50% of initial values. In the majority of patients that can be achieved by statin therapy. For this reason an adequate choice of statins is of crucial importance, whereby the needed reduction in atherogenic LDL-C, after the identification of its target level based on the assessment of total cardiovascular risk, can be achieved.",

In this review, the key characteristics of available fenofibrate formulations are examined. A literature search was conducted, focusing on comparative studies examining bioavailability, food effects, absorption, and lipid efficacy. Fenofibrate is highly lipophilic, virtually insoluble in water, and poorly absorbed. Coadministration with meals was necessary to maximize bioavailability of early formulations. Micronized and nanoparticle formulations of fenofibrate with reduced particle sizes were developed, resulting in greater solubility, improved bioavailability, and in some cases, the ability to be given irrespective of food. A recently introduced hydrophilic choline salt of fenofibric acid also can be taken without regard to meals, is absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, has the highest bioavailability among marketed formulations, and is approved for coadministration with a statin. Differences in bioavailability of fenofibrate formulations have resulted in low-dose (40 - 67) mg and standard-dose (120 - 200 mg) formulations. Different formulations are not equivalent on a milligram-to-milligram basis. In order to prevent medication errors, resulting in underdosing or overdosing with attendant consequences, it is important for healthcare providers to recognize that the formulations of fenofibrate and fenofibric acid that are currently available vary substantially in relation to food effect, equivalency on a milligram-to-milligram basis, and indication to be coadministered with a statin.",

On maximum tolerated statin (with or without other lipid-lowering drugs), 40% had LDL cholesterol <85 mg/dl and 23% had LDL cholesterol <70\u00a0mg/dl before starting ezetimibe. At the final study visit, 68% of ezetimibe patients achieved LDL cholesterol <85 mg/dl, and 46% achieved LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl. Using Cox regression analysis, the most significant factors associated with achieving LDL cholesterol goals were lower baseline LDL cholesterol, average statin dose, and ezetimibe use. In conclusion, after maximizing statin dose, the addition of ezetimibe results in a substantial increase in the percentage of patients who reach LDL cholesterol goal, a key component of optimal medical therapy.",

High-dose statin therapy increased PCSK9 levels from 279\u00b127 to 338\u00b150 ng/mL in HoFH, and significantly so in the HeFH patients from 202\u00b114 to 278\u00b120 ng/mL (P<0.01). Linear regression analysis showed a correlation between PCSK9 and LDL-C (r=0.6769; P<0.0001); however, this was eliminated following statin therapy (r=0.2972; P=0.0625).",

    "49": "Regulatory T cells (Treg), which play a pivotal role in maintaining immune homeostasis by suppressing the proliferation of effector T cells, have great therapeutic potential for autoimmune diseases and transplantation. However, progress on their clinical application has been hampered by the lack of high throughput screening (HTS) strategies for the systematic and rapid evaluation of existing drugs and the identification of novel drug candidates. In this report, we present an innovative in vitro HTS assay using CD4\u207a T cells from Foxp3-GFP transgenic mice that specifically express the GFP signal in Foxp3\u207a Treg cells detectable by FACS analysis in a high throughput manner. Systematic evaluation of 640 FDA-approved drugs revealed that 70 drugs increased the number of Treg cells with suppression function only in the presence of TGF\u03b2, 75 drugs increased Treg numbers even in the absence of TGF\u03b2, and 32 drugs increased Treg numbers synergistically with TGF\u03b2. The identified Treg-promoting drugs include those previously known to induce Treg (rapamycin and retinoic acid), statins, glucocorticoids and drugs in many other categories. Furthermore, Treg cells cultured with the identified drugs possess surface and intracellular markers characteristic of natural Treg cells and possess suppressive function. These results suggest that this Treg HTS assay can be used to screen compound libraries to identify novel chemical entities for Treg-based immune therapies.",

The main outcome measure was incident hospitalization for bacterial infection as principal diagnosis between 1993 and 2010. We also examined differences in statin use in 52 FDS1 pairs hospitalized with pneumonia (cases) or a contemporaneous non-infection-related cause (controls). During 12.0\u00b15.4 years of follow-up, 251 (19.4%) patients were hospitalized on 368 occasions for infection (23.7/1,000 patient-years). This was more than double the rate in matched controls (incident rate ratio (IRR) (95% CI), 2.13 (1.88-2.42), P<0.001).

The goal of this study was to evaluate if preoperative use of aspirin was associated with improved bypass grafting patency rates and limb salvage. We performed a four-year, retrospective review of one center's experience with open infra-inguinal bypass. We examined the effect pre- and postoperative usage of antiatherosclerotic agents (i.e. aspirin, statin, etc.) have on graft outcomes such as two-year secondary patency, stenosis and limb salvage via univariate Kaplan-Meir survival curve analysis and multiple regression analysis. Our cohort included 165 bypasses in individuals with multiple co-morbidities. The most frequent indication was critical limb ischemia (79%) and most bypasses crossed the knee (63%). Pre- and postoperative aspirin usage was associated with increased two-year secondary prosthetic graft patency over control (preoperative: 78% versus 44%, P < 0.002 and postoperative: 72% versus 50%, P < 0.01). Preoperative aspirin usage was associated with an improvement in the rate of amputation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.44 [95% CI 0.198-0.997]) and stenosis (OR = 0.45 [95% CI 0.217-0.956]). Medications commonly prescribed for atherosclerosis such as aspirin are associated with a significant patency benefit when administered pre- and postoperatively. In a population undergoing infrainguinal bypass with prosthetic graft for predominantly critical limb ischemia, medical optimization should include both pre- and postoperative antiatherosclerotic drug regimens.",

In addition, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the same subjects, we investigated gene expression of IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-10. Patients were longitudinally evaluated 1 month before surgery, when statin treatment was established, at the time of surgery, and after 2 and 5 months.

In this paper, a segmentation method based on Active Shape Model (ASM) is developed and evaluated to outline common carotid artery (CCA) for carotid atherosclerosis computer-aided evaluation and diagnosis. The proposed method is used to segment both media-adventitia-boundary (MAB) and lumen-intima-boundary (LIB) on transverse views slices from three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) images. The data set consists of sixty-eight, 17 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2, 3D US volume data acquired from the left and right carotid arteries of seventeen patients (eight treated with 80 mg atorvastatin and nine with placebo), who had carotid stenosis of 60% or more, at baseline and after three months of treatment. Manually outlined boundaries by expert are adopted as the ground truth for evaluation. For the MAB and LIB segmentations, respectively, the algorithm yielded Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 94.4%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2% and 92.8%\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3%, mean absolute distances (MAD) of 0.26 \u00b1 0.18 mm and 0.33 \u00b1 0.21 mm, and maximum absolute distances (MAXD) of 0.75 \u00b1 0.46 mm and 0.84 \u00b1 0.39 mm.

The objectives of this study were to determine low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal attainment rate at 4 months, and to examine prescription behavior influencing lipid goal attainment in Asian patients with ACS. A retrospective analysis of 267 patients with ACS was performed. The mean follow-up duration was 41.2\u00b110.7 months. LDL-C goal attainment rate was highest at 4 months (36.7%) but declined progressively throughout follow-up. More than 85% of patients were discharged with equipotent statin dose of 2 (equivalent to simvastatin 20 mg) or less. In patients who did not attain LDL-C goals, the statin dose remained low throughout follow-up because of a lack in responsive dose titration. Aggressive lipid-lowering therapy should be initiated early to improve goal attainment in these high-risk patients.", 
    "61": "Locally applied simvastatin is known to promote bone regeneration; however, the lack of suitable delivery systems has restricted its clinical use. In this study we demonstrate for the first time the use of premixed acidic calcium phosphate cement (CPC) as a delivery system for water-solubilized simvastatin. Freeze-dried simvastatin \u03b2-hydroxy acid (SVA) was added to the premixed cement paste in four different doses (1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0 mg SVA/g cement). The addition of the drug did not alter the cement setting time (38 min), compression strength (5.54 MPa), or diametral tensile strength (2.62 MPa). In a release study conducted in phosphate buffered saline at 37\u00b0C, a diffusion-controlled release was observed for over a week. Furthermore, the osteogenic effect of the released SVA was demonstrated in vitro. Cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization were assayed after incubation with cement extracts. The lower doses of SVA (0.5 and 0.25 mg SVA/g cement) showed an approximately fourfold increase in mineralization as compared to the control. In conclusion, our findings suggest that premixed acidic CPC is a good option for local delivery of SVA, due to its ability of slowly releasing the drug, leading to a prolonged stimulation of osteogenesis.",

The more drug therapies employed the greater the reduction, with the polypill reducing up to 351 cardiovascular events per 10,000 individuals. Cost-effectiveness analyses were sensitive to drug treatment costs and effectiveness of treatment. At a cost of AUD$42 per person per annum, aspirin was considered cost saving. All other treatment strategies, including the polypill, were not cost effective.",

    "67": "Significant elevation in serum cTnI, enlarged infarct size, and marked infiltration of inflammatory cells in myocardium were observed in the IR group. The administration of RSV significantly reduced the serum cTnI level, attenuated the accumulation of inflammatory cells, decreased infarct size, and increased the FoxP3 expression and Treg accumulation in myocardium compared with the IR group. The combination of RSV and MVA pretreatment partially abolished the anti-inflammatory and infarct size-limiting effects and completely reversed Treg accumulation in myocardium induced by RSV. The accumulation of inflammatory cells was negatively correlated with FoxP3 expression and Treg accumulation in the ischemic myocardium.",

The current algorithm for extracting SIM-suspected patients consisted of three steps: (i) event detection: increase in creatine kinase (CK) and subsequent statin discontinuation, (ii) filtration by exclusion factors (disease diagnosis/medical practices) and (iii) refinement by the time course of CK values (baseline, event and recovery). A causal relationship between the event and statin prescription (probable/possible/unlikely) was judged by review of patient medical charts by experienced pharmacists. The utility of the current algorithm was assessed by calculating the positive predictive value (PPV). In a comparative analysis, subjects screened in step 1 were extracted by the diagnostic term/code for 'myopathy/rhabdomyolysis', and the PPV of this diagnostic data approach was also estimated.",

Review of the medical charts revealed that the causal association of SIM with statin use was judged as 'Likely (probable/possible)' for all five suspected patients; thus, the PPV was estimated as 100% (95% confidence interval: 56\u00b76-100%). The higher utility of the current algorithm compared with the diagnostic data approach was also shown by assessing the PPV (100 vs. 33\u00b73%).",

    "73": "Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol via the mevalonate pathway. This pathway also produces coenzyme Q (a component of the respiratory chain), dolichols (important for protein glycosylation), and isoprenoids (lipid moieties responsible for the membrane association of small GTPases). We previously showed that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is useful to study the noncholesterol effects of statins because its mevalonate pathway lacks the sterol synthesis branch but retains all other branches. Here, from a screen of 150,000 mutagenized genomes, we isolated four C. elegans mutants resistant to statins by virtue of gain-of-function mutations within the first six amino acids of the protein ATFS-1, the key regulator of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response that includes activation of the chaperones HSP-6 and HSP-60. The atfs-1 gain-of-function mutants are also resistant to ibandronate, an inhibitor of an enzyme downstream of HMG-CoA reductase, and to gliotoxin, an inhibitor acting on a subbranch of the pathway important for protein prenylation, and showed improved mitochondrial function and protein prenylation in the presence of statins. Additionally, preinduction of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in wild-type worms using ethidium bromide or paraquat triggered statin resistance, and similar observations were made in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and in a mammalian cell line. We conclude that statin resistance through maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis is conserved across species, and that the cell-lethal effects of statins are caused primarily through impaired protein prenylation that results in mitochondria dysfunction.",

Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate drug-drug interactions between atorvastatin or pravastatin and boceprevir. We conducted a single-center, open-label, fixed-sequence, one-way-crossover study with 20 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects received single-dose atorvastatin (40 mg) or pravastatin (40 mg) on day 1, followed by boceprevir (800 mg three times daily) for 7 to 10 days. Repeat single doses of atorvastatin or pravastatin were administered in the presence of steady-state boceprevir. Atorvastatin exposure increased in the presence of boceprevir, with atorvastatin area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity after single dosing (AUC(inf)) increasing 2.3-fold (90% confidence interval [CI], 1.85, 2.90) and maximum observed concentration in plasma (Cmax) 2.7-fold (90% CI, 1.81, 3.90). Pravastatin exposure was slightly increased in the presence of boceprevir, with pravastatin AUC(inf) increasing 1.63-fold (90% CI, 1.03, 2.58) and C(max) 1.49-fold (90% CI, 1.03, 2.14). Boceprevir exposure was generally unchanged when the drug was coadministered with atorvastatin or pravastatin. All adverse events were mild and consistent with the known safety profile of boceprevir. The observed 130% increase in AUC of atorvastatin supports the use of the lowest possible effective dose of atorvastatin when coadministered with boceprevir, without exceeding a maximum daily dose of 40 mg. The observed 60% increase in pravastatin AUC with boceprevir coadministration supports the initiation of pravastatin treatment at the recommended dose when coadministered with boceprevir, with close clinical monitoring.",

    "77": "We included 181 placebo-controlled and active-comparator trials including 256,827 individuals. There were 83 two-armed placebo-controlled trials and the remaining 98 were two- or multi-armed active-comparator trials. All statins reduced serum LDL and total cholesterol levels: higher doses resulted in higher reductions in pretreatment LDL and total cholesterol concentrations. In absolute terms, all statins significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels as compared to control treatment from average baseline levels of approximately 150\u2009mg/dl, except for fluvastatin at \u226420\u2009mg/day and lovastatin at \u226410\u2009mg/day. Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin were broadly equivalent in terms of their LDL cholesterol-lowering effects. Dose-comparative effects of indivudual statins were not different between those with and without coronary heart disease at baseline. According to meta-regression analyses, LDL cholesterol-lowering effects of individual statins were not impacted by differences across trials in terms of baseline mean age and proportion of women as trial participants. Pretreatment LDL cholesterol concentrations had a marginally statistically significant effect on LDL cholesterol change from baseline. Mean differences from baseline in HDL cholesterol as compared to control treatment was not significant for any statin-dose combination.", 
    "78": "The findings of this comprehensive review provide supporting evidence for the dose-response relationship of statins in reducing LDL and total cholesterol. The LDL cholesterol-reducing effects of some statins appear less pronounced than the findings of previous meta-analyses, which is particularly the case for the high-dose formulations of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. The most consistent evidence for a combined reduction in both LDL and total cholesterol was achieved with atorvastatin at >40\u2009mg/day, rosuvastatin at >10\u2009mg/day, and simvastatin at >40\u2009mg/day, which appear equivalent in terms of their LDL and total cholesterol-reducing effects.", 
    "79": "A luminol electrochemiluminescence assay was reported to analyze active cholesterol at the plasma membrane in single mammalian cells. The cellular membrane cholesterol was activated by the exposure of the cells to low ionic strength buffer or the inhibition of intracellular acyl-coA/cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). The active membrane cholesterol was reacted with cholesterol oxidase in the solution to generate a peak concentration of hydrogen peroxide on the electrode surface, which induced a measurable luminol electrochemiluminescence. Further treatment of the active cells with mevastatin decreased the active membrane cholesterol resulting in a drop in luminance. No change in the intracellular calcium was observed in the presence of luminol and voltage, which indicated that our analysis process might not interrupt the intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Single cell analysis was performed by placing a pinhole below the electrode so that only one cell was exposed to the photomultiplier tube (PMT). Twelve single cells were analyzed individually, and a large deviation on luminance ratio observed exhibited the cell heterogeneity on the active membrane cholesterol. The smaller deviation on ACAT/HMGCoA inhibited cells than ACAT inhibited cells suggested different inhibition efficiency for sandoz 58035 and mevastatin. The new information obtained from single cell analysis might provide a new insight on the study of intracellular cholesterol trafficking.",

Simvastatin administered from day 1 to 28 normalized all these parameters. Simvastatin administered from day 13 to 28 had no effect on HPC and LC, but reduced RV/(LV+S) significantly and induced a strong trend to lower RVSP and BNP levels. Exercise capacity was reduced by Bleomycin. Simvastatin significantly improved exercise intolerance in both treatment groups.",

About 40 % of women in developed countries will experience an osteoporosis-related fracture in the course of their lifetime, with men experiencing approximately one-third to one-half the risk of women. The \"lipid hypothesis of osteoporosis\" claims for a role of oxidized lipids as a contributing factor in osteoporosis. On the other hand, statins are supposed to exert anabolic effects on the bone, either through their lipid-lowering action or signal pathways that are independent of their effects on lipid levels. The epidemiological evidence seems to suggest that higher triglycerides may give some protection against fracture, although no association with reduced fracture risk has been reported between lipid-lowering drug (except statins) users and non-users. The epidemiological evidence for a role of statins in osteoporosis is strong, with a lower fracture risk ranging from 30 to 40 % in statin users versus non-users. However, some pitfalls inherent to observational studies (high heterogeneity, residual confounding, potential publication bias) and the lack of association in randomized trials suggest caution.

However, the need to treat, and the correct treatment approach for patients with mild to moderate HTG are issues for ongoing evaluation. In the past, it was felt that triglyceride does not directly contribute to development of atherosclerotic plaques. However, this view is evolving, especially for triglyceride-related fractions and variables measured in the non-fasting state. Our understanding of the etiology, genetics and classification of HTG states is also evolving. Previously, HTG was considered to be a dominant disorder associated with variation within a single gene. The old nomenclature includes the term \"familial\" in the names of several hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) phenotypes that included HTG as part of their profile, including combined hyperlipidemia (HLP type 2B), dysbetalipoproteinemia (HLP type 3), simple HTG (HLP type 4) and mixed hyperlipidemia (HLP type 5). This old thinking has given way to the idea that genetic susceptibility to HTG results from cumulative effects of multiple genetic variants acting in concert. HTG most is often a \"polygenic\" or \"multigenic\" trait. However, a few rare autosomal recessive forms of severe HTG have been defined. Treatment depends on the overall clinical context, including severity of HTG, concomitant presence of other lipid disturbances, and the patient's global risk of cardiovascular disease. Therapeutic strategies include dietary counselling, lifestyle management, control of secondary factors, use of omega-3 preparations and selective use of pharmaceutical agents.",

In normal male C57BL/6J mice, 4 weeks of treatment with or without a statin (pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or atorvastatin) did not affect any biochemical parameters, including the lipid profile. However, cardiac gene expression profiling by microarray analysis revealed distinct patterns among the five groups. Several genes that might be involved in cardiac function, including Ccnd2, Klf7 and Timp3, were differentially regulated by treatment with a specific statin. In the primary cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes, statin-induced changes in the expression of these genes were largely unaffected by supplementation with mevalonic acid. These data indicate that statins directly regulate cardiac gene expression in a drug-specific manner in normal mice. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these differences influence the clinical efficacy in particular patients, such as those with heart failure.",

Data extraction and meta-analysis were conducted using standard methods. The meta-analysis was performed with data derived from 10 cohort studies of the effects of statins on atrial fibrillation. The endpoint used was the occurrence or new onset of AF. A total of 193,839 patients were included, and 87,741 (45.26%) patients received statin therapy.

In this study we evaluated the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor lovastatin as an anti-inflammatory drug to control RSV-induced cytokine secretion in the murine RAW 264.7 (RAW) macrophage cell line and in primary murine lung macrophages. These cells could be efficiently infected with RSV in vitro, and although no significant level of infectious virus particles were produced, the increased expression of several virus structural proteins could be detected. Virus infection and gene expression correlated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by 24 h post infection. Lovastatin treatment did not reduce the cellular cholesterol levels in RSV-infected cells, nor did it inhibit RSV infection. However, we observed a significant reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in lovastatin-treated RSV-infected cells. Since enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion is a major factor in RSV-associated pathology our findings highlighted the potential use of statins to mitigate and control the inflammatory response due to RSV infection. Furthermore, our study suggested that RAW cells maybe a simple and cost-effective model cell system to screen small molecule libraries to identify compounds that are effective in reducing RSV-induced inflammation.",

These antibodies are also found in some autoimmune myopathy patients without statin exposure. Importantly, anti-HMGCR antibodies are not found in the vast majority of statin-exposed subjects without autoimmune myopathy, including those with self-limited statin intolerance.

Concomitance of CKD and diabetes predicts a greater risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than either condition in isolation. Hence, appropriate management of modifiable cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, including dyslipidemia, is paramount in this high-risk group. The United States and Japan have distinct approaches to cholesterol management, with more stringent therapeutic targets for lipid control advocated in US guidelines. However, upward trends in cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease incidence in Japan may provide justification for more intensive CV risk factor management strategies by Japanese physicians to achieve maximum benefit. Attainment of recommended lipid goals in Japan is poor, particularly in patients with diabetes and/or CKD in whom CV risk factors are often undertreated. Statin therapy has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing CV risk in patients with diabetes and/or CKD stages 1-5.

Expression of genes for cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and sterol regulatory element binding protein 2), apical cholesterol uptake (Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 and scavenger receptor class B Type 1) and basolateral cholesterol efflux [ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)] was significantly decreased by CBE compared with control. Western blot analysis confirmed that CBE inhibited expression of these proteins. In contrast, CBE markedly induced mRNA and/or protein levels of ABCG5 and ABCG8 that mediate apical cholesterol efflux to the intestinal lumen. Furthermore, CBE significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, and cellular LDL uptake. Expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and lipoprotein assembly, including sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, fatty acid synthase and acyl-CoA oxidase 1, was significantly decreased by CBE in a dose-dependent manner. Concomitantly, CBE significantly increased sirtuin 1, 3 and 5 mRNA levels, while it decreased SIRT-2.

Patients were stratified into two groups according to HDL-C levels (low HDL-C group, baseline HDL-C <40 mg/dl; high HDL-C group, \u226540 mg/dl). Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) that included all-cause death, acute coronary syndrome, and target lesion revascularization were evaluated between the two groups. The median follow-up period was 946 days. The rate of MACE was significantly higher in diabetic patients with low-HDL-C who achieved optimal LDL-C (6.9 vs 17.9 %, log-rank P = 0.030). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that HDL-C is significantly associated with clinical outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio for MACE 1.33, 95 % confidence interval 1.01-1.75, P = 0.042). Low HDL-C is a residual risk factor that is significantly associated with long-term clinical outcomes among diabetic patients with stable CAD who achieve optimal LDL-C levels.", 
    "131": "We explored the neuroprotection by atorvastatin in the ischemia/reperfusion model of rat and its microRNA-related mechanisms. At first, we uncovered a previously unknown alteration in temporal expression of a large set of microRNAs following spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The target genes for the differentially expressed microRNAs include genes encoding components that are involved in the inflammation, apoptosis, and neural damage that are known to play important roles in IRI. Atorvastatin pretreatment restored part of the up or down regulations. These findings suggest that altered expression of microRNAs may contribute to the mechanism of neuroprotection of statins in spinal cord IRI.",

A retrospective nested case-control study was carried out on patient records from the Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. All male patients with a new diagnosis of OID over a 5-year period were included. Ten control subjects (without OID) were age-matched to each OID case. Prescription files of all subjects were queried for statin use. Information on selected comorbid medical conditions was also obtained. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of OID development in the context of statin use, controlling for comorbid conditions.",

A trend toward a reduction in the risk of new OID development was found in patients that used statins compared to those that did not (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.23, p = 0.13). The longer the duration of statin use, the greater is the effect.",

Due to drug combination of these formulations, there has been a need for a reliable quantitative method to determine these drugs in commercial samples and human serum. The chromatographic separation was carried out at ambient temperature with a mobile phase consisting of methanol-water (90 + 10, v/v), with pH adjusted to 3.50 with phosphoric acid. The pump was operated at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and all analytes were detected at 235 nm. The method was linear over the concentration range of 5-50 microg/mL for all the drugs. The LOD of gliquidone, pioglitazone hydrochloride, and atorvastatin was 0.30, 1.30, and 0.57 microg/mL and LOQ was 0.98, 4.28, and 1.90 microg/mL, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of these drugs in commercial tablets and human serum.

Results have shown that HCAEC apoptosis had increased with increasing concentration of AGEs. Atorvastatin may decrease HCAEC apoptosis, but the effect can be attenuated by PI3K inhibitor. Secretion of PI3K and P-Akt in HCAEC increased with increasing concentration of AGEs. Secretion of PI3K in HCAEC may be decreased by atorvastatin. The effect may be attenuated by PI3K inhibitor. HSF-1, HSP-70 mRNA expression level decreased with increasing concentration of AGEs. Atorvastatin may attenuate AGEs-induced HSF-1, HSP-70 mRNA expression in HCAEC, but the effect can be attenuated by PI3K inhibitor. It can be concluded that AGE can dose-dependently promote HCAEC apoptosis by the PI3K/AKT pathway. Atorvastatin may attenuate the effect possibly by upregulating HSF-1.",

The antiplatelet therapy should be continued in patients with a high risk for cardiovascular thrombosis. This might be true even for operations in which bleeding should be strictly avoided such as eye surgery. One of the most recent neuroprotective approaches is the remote ischaemic preconditioning.", 
    "152": "Perioperative stroke increases morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing surgery and is therefore highly relevant. Neuromonitoring should be used to detect a deterioration of cerebral blood flow and oxygen supply immediately. Statins which are initiated at least 2 weeks before the operation can possibly reduce the perioperative stroke rate. Routinely taken statins should not be terminated and this is also true for \u03b2-blockers. The cerebral perfusion pressure should be kept at baseline levels, whereas a mild hypercapnia theoretically could be beneficial. Hypoglycemia has to be avoided while treatment of high blood glucose levels should be started when they exceed 150 mg/dl.

Three studies found that high adherence significantly improves health outcomes and reduces annual costs for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (between $294 and $868 per patient, equating to 10.1%-17.8% cost reductions between high- and low-adherence groups). The studies were all of generally of high quality on the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (median score 8 of 9).", 
    "200": "Increased medication adherence is associated with improved outcomes and reduced costs, but most studies do not control for a \"healthy adherer\" effect.", 
    "201": "Despite achievement of optimal epicardial coronary flow in the majority of patients treated for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), myocardial no-reflow is a common phenomenon occurring in 5 to 50% of patients. The no-reflow phenomenon is a predictor of infarct size and an independent predictor of mortality both in the short and long term. Prevention of no-reflow is therefore a crucial step in improving prognosis of patients with STEMI. Several strategies including pharmacological and mechanical ones have been developed to improve microvascular perfusion in the setting of a myocardial infarction. Prevention starts by conservation of the microvascular reserve especially in patients at high risk of acute coronary syndromes such as diabetes patients. Optimal glycaemic control and the use of statins have been shown to reduce no-reflow in this context. Reducing ischaemic time by shortening door to balloon times, administration of intracoronary GP IIb/IIIa antagonists during PPCI and the use of manual aspiration thrombectomy have been shown to result in better myocardial perfusion and improved clinical outcome in major trials. In this review we discuss some of these major trials and studies of other therapeutic options that aim to prevent the no-reflow phenomenon."
