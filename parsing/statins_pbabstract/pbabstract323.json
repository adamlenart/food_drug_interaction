Pretreatment vitamin D levels showed significant and positive associations with changes in 2 bone formation markers. The serial changes in 3 markers were favorable-increased bone formation markers and unchanged bone resorption marker-but the changes occurred only in patients with pretreatment vitamin D levels >50 pg/ml.",

The data indicate that epsilon4 carriers have increased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, that the epsilon4 allele unfavorably decreases the efficiency of statin treatment, and that the angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion polymorphism exerts no significant effect, with the exception of an increase in apolipoprotein E levels.", 
    "4": "There is growing evidence that hyperinsulinemia is linked to the development of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes. We demonstrated previously that high insulin exacerbates neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion and endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Though 3-hydroxymethyl-3-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been employed as therapeutic agents in the treatment of dyslipidemia, which is frequently accompanied by diabetes mellitus; it is not known whether statins protect against leukocyte-endothelial interactions, especially in hyperinsulinemia. In this study, we determined which statin(s) could protect against endothelial reactions to high insulin.", 
    "5": "Studies of adhesion between neutrophils from healthy volunteers and human umbilical vein endothelial cells incubated in regular insulin-rich medium with or without statins were performed. Adhered neutrophils were quantified by measuring their myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and endothelial expression of ICAM-1 was examined using an enzyme immunoassay.", 
    "6": "Both the increased neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion and ICAM-1 expression caused by high insulin (100 microU/ml) for 48 h were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with cerivastatin (0.01 microM), but not by fluvastatin (0.5 microM) or pravastatin (0.05 microM). These protective actions of cerivastatin were attenuated by a key intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, mevalonate (400 microM). In addition, cerivastatin attenuated both neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion and endothelial ICAM-1 expression enhanced by a MAP kinase activator, anisomycin (1 microM) but not by a PKC activator, PMA (10 nM).",

    "8": "With the aging population and rising prevalence of vascular disease in developed and developing countries, increasing numbers of individuals are at risk of cognitive impairment. Despite the potential of the therapeutics that are currently under investigation, none have yet fulfilled their promise for the prevention and treatment of dementia. The term vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) describes individuals with significant cognitive impairment arising from vascular disease. Risk factors predisposing to stroke correlate with brain changes, cognitive loss and Alzheimer's disease pathology. The volume of the infarcts and white matter changes, silent lacunar infarcts, and global and regional brain atrophy may be imaged non-invasively, targeted as surrogates of the dementia processes and considered parameters to be targeted for interventional strategies. As the greatest chance to prevent cognitive impairment and its progression is by intervening in the early stages or prior to any change, the development of preventative therapeutics is an important strategy. Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques may help to identify a subgroup of patients in whom infarct prevention, via risk factor control, may be of paramount importance. As the pathophysiology of dementia becomes more fully understood by coupling neuropsychological with neuroimaging, genetic and pathological features, there is the potential for the establishment of diagnostic criteria of the early phase of VCI and the testing of novel interventional strategies.",

It is based on the control of vascular risk factors, the use of statins and antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs). Although antiplatelet agents have not proved to be beneficial in the primary prevention of stroke, they are recommended in patients with ICS in order to lower the risk of heart attack associated with this pathology. The use of antiplatelet drugs in the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke secondary to an ICS is based on clinical trials which have shown that antiaggregation prevents non-cardioembolic strokes. Nevertheless, several retrospective studies have observed that oral anticoagulation is better than antiaggregation with aspirin. Two prospective clinical trials are currently being conducted which will, in the next few years, help to determine what the first choice medical treatment is for this group of patients.",

Statin therapy was associated with a reduced incidence of VTE in both the HRT group and the placebo arm. The negative effect of HRT on the primary outcome seen in the 1st year of treatment was much reduced among baseline statin users and was no longer statistically significant (RH=1.34, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.86, p=0.45).",

The very-high-risk group had the lowest proportion (37%) of participants who achieved their target.", 
    "19": "Consistent with other studies, this study found that as cardiac risk increased, the proportion of patients achieving their target cholesterol values decreased, such that those at the greatest risk for cardiovascular disease (who had the most to gain from aggressive lipid-lowering interventions) were least likely to achieve their cholesterol targets. This suggests a need for more-aggressive approaches to the management of cholesterol, particularly in high-risk patients.", 
    "20": "It is well known that simvastatin affects cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore it inhibits growth and proliferation and perturbs fatty acid metabolism in some cell lines. We have studied the effects of simvastatin on the uptake and metabolism of exogenous fatty acid in the human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells. Simvastatin inhibited the proliferation of A549, and caused an increment in phospholipid/cholesterol ratio due to an increment in phospholipid content without affecting cholesterol content. All the fatty acids were uptaken and metabolized in both control and treated cells. The conversion of palmitic, linoleic and dihomo-gamma-linoleic acids to their metabolites and products/precursor ratios for the desaturation and elongation reactions showed that simvastatin enhanced the Delta5 desaturation step and altered some elongating steps. The machinery for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in A549 is quite sensitive to simvastatin and its effects could have important implication taking into account that highly unsaturated fatty acids are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular functions by themselves or through their metabolites.",

Neopterin was measured in 232 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography and compared to the degree of atherosclerosis, use of concomitant medications and demographics. Neopterin was lower in subjects using statins (n = 66) compared to those not taking statins (median (range): 6.65 (4.1-18.3) vs. 7.70 (3.6-29.1) nmol/l, p < 0.0001). This association was also found in the subgroup of patients with coronary artery disease (1-3-vessel disease, n = 164; 6.60 (4.1-18.3) vs. 7.80 (3.6-29.1) nmol/l, p = 0.0012), whereas only a slight tendency toward lower neopterin levels was found in the group without atherosclerosis (6.90 (5.1-16.0) vs. 7.60 (4.0-18.5) nmol/l, p = 0.17). In patients with coronary atherosclerosis, neopterin concentrations were lower in smokers (n = 105) compared to non-smokers (7.20 (3.6-29.1) vs. 7.90 (4.4-18.6) nmol/l, p < 0.02), confirming previous observations. However, use of statins was associated with lower neopterin levels in both non-smokers and smokers (6.70 (4.1-18.3) vs. 7.60 (3.6-29.1) nmol/l, p < 0.05, and 6.20 (5.2-16.0) vs. 7.80 (4.4-18.6) nmol/l, p < 0.05, respectively). Overall, similar serum neopterin concentrations were found in patients with coronary atherosclerosis and those without.

While aspirin, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce coronary mortality and morbidity, statins are rapidly coming to fore as another important cog in the wheel of primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Newer trial like Heart Protection Study suggests benefit of statin for high risk individuals, irrespective of initial serum cholesterol concentrations.

A less significant reduction was observed in mean triglycerides (TG) level (16 and 25%) compared with TC and LDL cholesterol. There was no significant difference in mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels compared with baseline in either group.

Methods for secondary stroke prevention include a healthy lifestyle, intensive body exercise, a low cholesterol diet, and the cessation of smoking. High levels of blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose should be rigorously controlled. In particular, blood pressure levels should remain below 135/85 mmHg including a physiological day/night profile. All patients at high risk for cardiac embolism should receive oral anticoagulants. As the risk for embolic events increases with age (especially in patients with atrial fibrillation), a rigid \"age-cutoff\" for anticoagulation is not justified.", 
    "29": "The short- and intermediate-term pleiotropic effects of atorvastatin were investigated in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients, as well as the temporal differences in these pleiotropic effects. Atorvastatin was given for 3 months and fasting lipid concentrations, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), fibrinolytic parameters, and flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery (FMD) were measured at baseline and after 2 weeks and 3 months of therapy. Atorvastatin reduced the total cholesterol (273+/-34 vs 188+/-31 mg/dl, p<0.0001), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C: 174+/-28 vs 111+/-23 mg/dl, p<0.0001), small, dense LDL-C (34+/-22 vs 18+/-20%, p<0.01), remnant-like particles cholesterol (RLP-C: 8.8+/-6.0 vs 5.1+/-2.6 mg/ml, p<0.01), and TBARS (3.3+/-1.0 vs 3.1+/-0.9 nmol/ml, p<0.05) after 2 weeks. Atorvastatin decreased the concentration of small, dense LDL-C again after 3 months (8+/-13%, p<0.0001). The plasma concentrations of the fibrinolytic parameters did not change significantly after 3 months of atorvastatin therapy. FMD increased significantly after 2 weeks (5.6+/-2.1 vs 6.3+/-2.0%, p<0.01) and additionally increased after 3 months of therapy (8.3+/-1.9%, p<0.0001). There were no correlations between the pleiotropic effects and the improvement in the lipid profile. The results indicate some short-term pleiotropic effects of atorvastatin therapy within 2 weeks, which may be important with respect to the early benefits of statin therapy.", 
    "30": "The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of atorvastatin and pravastatin on lipid parameters and the concentration of malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) in hypercholesterolemic patients. A total of 17 patients (10 men, 7 women; mean age, 68+/-9 years) who were indicated for drug therapy based on the National Cholesterol Education Program II underwent an 8-week regimen of atorvastatin (10 mg/day) or pravastatin (10 mg/day) with a 4-week washout period between drugs. After an overnight fast, lipid parameters and MDA-LDL concentration were measured before and after the 8-week treatment with each drug. Both atorvastatin and pravastatin produced significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and MDA-LDL concentrations, with a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. The percent reductions in LDL cholesterol and MDA-LDL concentration were significantly greater with atorvastatin than pravastatin (46 +/-6% vs 24+/-10%, p<0.0001, and 44+/-10% vs 14+/-13%, p<0.0001, respectively). The ratios of percent reductions in MDA-LDL concentrations and percent reductions in LDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly greater for atorvastatin than pravastatin (0.96+/-0.19 vs 0.59+/-0.55, p<0.0001). In conclusion, atorvastatin reduced serum concentrations of LDL cholesterol and MDA-LDL to a greater degree than pravastatin, indicating that atorvastatin not only has stronger lipid-lowering effects, but also stronger antioxidative effects than pravastatin.", 
    "31": "Melanoma is a deadly cancer due to its propensity to metastasize. Pharmacological inhibition of cell motility may benefit patients with cutaneous melanoma by preventing metastasis to internal organs. The Rho GTPases are signaling molecules that drive metastasis by controlling cell motility. We found RhoC to be expressed in clinical melanoma specimens and hypothesized that inhibiting its activation might prevent metastasis. Some Rho proteins, such as RhoC, depend on posttranslational geranylgeranylation for biological activity. We investigated the effect that Atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor that prevents Rho geranylgeranylation, had on subcellular localization and activity of Rho proteins as well as the metastatic ability of melanoma cells. Atorvastatin inhibited Rho activation and reverted the metastatic phenotype of human melanoma cells in vitro. Moreover, Atorvastatin, at plasma levels comparable to those used to treat of hypercholesterolemia, inhibited in vivo metastasis of melanoma cells overexpressing RhoC. These results support further examination of statins for primary prophylaxis of melanoma metastasis.", 
    "32": "In THP-1 cells, simvastatin decreases, in a concentration-dependent manner, cholesterol synthesis and increases linoleic acid (LA) conversion to its long-chain derivatives, in particular to arachidonic acid, activating delta6 and delta5 fatty acid (FA) desaturases. The intermediates in cholesterol synthesis, mevalonate and geranylgeraniol, partially reverse the effects of simvastatin on the LA conversion. The aims of this work were to evaluate: (i) the correlation between cholesterol synthesis and desaturase activity and (ii) the possible involvement of protein isoprenylation in desaturase activity, assessed through pharmacological treatments. THP-1 cells were incubated with [1-14C]LA or with [1-14C]di-homo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHGLA) and treated with simvastatin or with curcumin and nicardipine, inhibitors of desaturases. Curcumin was more active than nicardipine in inhibiting LA and DHGLA conversion: 20 microM curcumin, alone or with simvastatin, totally inhibited delta6 and delta5 desaturation steps; 10 microM nicardipine only partially inhibited the enzymes, being more active on delta5 desaturase. Simvastatin treatment decreased the incorporation of acetate in cholesterol (-93.8%) and cholesterol esters (-70.2%), as expected. Curcumin and nicardipine also decreased cholesterol synthesis and potentiated simvastatin. Finally, the isoprenylation inhibitors (perillic acid and GGTI-286) neither affected the conversion of LA nor inhibited the delta5 desaturase activity. In conclusion, our results indicate that there is no direct relationship between cholesterol synthesis and desaturase activity. In fact, simvastatin decreased cholesterol synthesis and enhanced LA conversion (mainly delta5 desaturation), whereas curcumin and nicardipin decreased delta5 desaturation, with a limited effect on cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "33": "The causal relationship between amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) deposition and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-specific neuropathological lesions such as neurodegeneration and cortical atrophy is still not known. Mounting evidence points to alterations in cholesterol homeostasis occurring in AD brain that are probably linked to cerebral Abeta pathology. Interestingly, cholesterol not only modulates Abeta synthesis, but also controls interactions between Abeta and neuronal membranes that are regarded as decisive in the initiation of a neurotoxic cascade. This review focuses on the impact of cholesterol on membrane disordering effects of Abeta. Cholesterol is known to be an essential modulator of physicochemical state and functional activity in physiological membranes, and thus plays an essential role in the regulation of synaptic function and cell plasticity. In vitro and in vivo modulation of membrane cholesterol levels affect different cholesterol pools within the plasma membrane bilayer that are differentially sensitive to Abeta's disrupting effects. Membrane acyl-chains in the hydrocarbon core are most susceptible to Abeta. In this membrane region, cholesterol attenuates the membrane disordering effects of Abeta. This cholesterol pool is modulated by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) treatment in vitro. On the other hand, statin treatment in vivo depletes a cholesterol pool in a membrane area, which is much less susceptible to Abeta's membrane-disrupting effects. Our findings clearly implicate an involvement of cholesterol in brain membrane alterations occurring during AD. Disease-related changes in membrane cholesterol metabolism may be subtle and restricted to defined membrane pools since total membrane cholesterol levels are mainly unchanged in AD brain. Thus, elucidation of the structure and function of different cholesterol pools is necessary in understanding the coherence between cholesterol and AD.", 
    "34": "Niemann Pick C (NPC), a fatal autosomal-recessive neurovisceral lipid storage disorder, is a juvenile dementia with massive nerve-cell loss and cytoskeletal abnormalities in cerebral neurons. These abnormalities consist of tangles of tau protein, which is otherwise highly soluble and usually stabilizes the microtubules. Immunologically and ultrastructurally similar tangles are seen some decades later in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is evidence that tangle-bearing cells in both diseases show higher levels of free (i. e. filipin-positive) cholesterol than adjacent tangle-free nerve cells. The cholesterol accumulates either in a more diffuse way (mainly in AD) or in granule-like accumulations (mainly in NPC). In NPC, neuron cholesterol may originate from sources other than the alimentary tract. Experiments with a NPC mouse model revealed that even in pure neuron cultures, the NPC -/- neurons accumulate free cholesterol in contrast to NPC-wt littermates, suggesting that the cholesterol is either synthesized by the neurons or liberated from degenerated ones before being taken up by the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. The accumulation of free cholesterol in the somata of NPC neurons is associated with a decrease of cholesterol levels in myelin sheaths. In terms of tau protein, NPC -/- mice exhibit higher levels of AT8-positive tau, suggesting that the phosphorylation-dependent mAb AT8 has detected a tau-epitope in a state considered to represent early stages of tangle formation. Concomitantly to the increase in free intracellular cholesterol, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis, HMG-CoA reductase, was found to be significantly reduced. Experimental blockade of the enzyme's activity by application of the lipid-lowering drug lovastatin showed subcellular shifts in tau phosphorylation as monitored with mAbs AT8, 12E8 and others. In summary, the data showed interesting similarities between NPC and AD suggesting some pathological metabolic pathway in common.", 
    "35": "Growing evidence suggests that cellular cholesterol homeostasis is causally involved in different steps leading to pathological events in the brain of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients. It was previously demonstrated that the processing of the amyloid beta-peptide precursor protein (APP) is modulated by pronounced alterations in cellular cholesterol levels using statins or cholesterol extracting agents. However, a cholesterol-rich diet was found to enhance amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) burden in the brain of transgenic mice without clearly affecting total brain cholesterol levels. Recent retrospective epidemiological studies have reported that the use of statins potentially suppresses the development of AD. Although some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors seem to influence the central cholesterol pool in vivo, the above epidemiological findings are probably not linked to statin-induced changes in brain membrane cholesterol levels per se since not all statins active in preventing AD enter the central nervous system (CNS). Recently, we reported that different statins, regardless of their brain availability, induce alterations in cellular cholesterol distribution in the brain. Such pleiotropic, cholesterol-synthesis independent statin effects might be indirect and are possibly mediated at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via nitric oxide (NO) or apolipoprotein E (ApoE).", 
    "36": "The enzymatic conversion of CNS cholesterol to 24S-hydroxycholesterol, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, is the major pathway for brain cholesterol elimination and brain cholesterol homeostasis maintenance. The enzyme mediating this conversion has been characterized at the molecular level (CYP46) and is mainly located in neurons. Like other oxysterols, 24S-hydroxycholesterol is efficiently converted into normal bile acids or excreted in bile in its sulfated and glucuronidated form. Levels of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the circulation decrease with age in infants and children. In adults, however, the levels appear to be stable. There is accumulating evidence pointing toward a potentially important link between cholesterol, beta-amyloid, and Alzheimer's disease. Concentrations of 24S-hydroxycholesterol in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are significantly higher in Alzheimer's disease and vascular demented patients at early stages of the disease compared to healthy subjects. Variations in genetic background, time of disease onset, and severity of dementia are potential sources of variance. Inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, also termed statins, seem to have a reductive influence on the generation of the amyloid precursor protein, the neuronal secretion of beta-amyloid, and on de novo cholesterol synthesis. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that the prevalence of diagnosed AD and vascular dementia is reduced among people taking statins for a longer period of time. High-dose simvastatin treatment (80 mg/day) in patients with hypercholesterolemia leads to a significant decrease in brain-specific serum 24S-hydroxycholesterol concentrations and indicates a diminished cholesterol metabolism in the brain. CSF levels of cholesterol and lathosterol, a cholesterol precursor considered to be an indicator for cholesterol neogenesis, were significantly decreased in statin-treated subjects compared to non-treated normo- and hypercholesterolemic subjects. Also, CSF concentrations of 24S-hydroxycholesterol were significantly lower in statin-treated patients compared to normocholesterolemic subjects. Treatment with high-dose simvastatin in normocholesterolemic Alzheimer patients for 26 weeks at early stages of the disease results in a significant decrease in Abeta-levels in cerebrospinal fluid. This decrease correlates with the reduction of 24S-hydroxycholesterol.", 
    "37": "Controlled clinical studies and clinical experience over many years have proven that virtually all patients benefit from lipid-lowering therapy with statins, even those with normal LDL cholesterol levels. Several recent large outcome trials have further demonstrated the clinical benefits and safety of statins in patients with a wide-range of high risks for cardiovascular disease. Those patients at highest absolute cardiovascular risk generally have the most to gain from statin therapy. A variety of statins are available to lower plasma lipids to guideline levels, but all differ in their pharmacokinetic properties, drug interaction profiles, and risk of myotoxicity. This has been highlighted by the withdrawal of cerivastatin from the market as a result of serious safety concerns. This review examines the safety and effectiveness of statins in special populations at high risk of cardiovascular disease-patients with coronary heart disease, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension, nephrotic disease, HIV, organ transplant patients and the elderly-with a focus on clinically relevant differences in the properties of individual statins that may influence the risk of drug interactions and side effects.",

Treatment with lovastatin resulted in the induction of LPS/IFN-gamma-mediated iNOS mRNA and increased nitric oxide (NO) production. The addition of mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) reversed the lovastatin-mediated effect, whereas FPP had no effect. An inhibitor of geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor (GGTI 298) further induced the cytokine and lovastatin-mediated iNOS expression, suggesting the involvement of geranylgeranylated proteins in the regulation of iNOS. Bacterial toxin B (inactivates RhoA, B, and C; CDC42; Rac proteins), C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase (C3) toxin from C. botulinum (inactivates RhoA, B, and C proteins), and Y-27632 (selective inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases) increased the LPS/IFN-gamma-mediated iNOS expression. Lovastatin treatment induced NO by increasing NF-kappaB translocation and its association with the CREB-binding protein (CBP/p300) via the downregulation of RhoA. Inhibition of RhoA resulted in increased activation of IKKalpha. Cotransfection studies with dominant-negative form of RhoA and iNOS-luciferase or NF-kappaB-luciferase reporter constructs further support these observations. Taken together, these studies show that downregulation of RhoA by lovastatin resulted in increased iNOS expression via the activation of NF-kappaB-CBP/p300 pathway in transformed brain cells.",

    "44": "Cardiac hypertrophy is an initial physiological adaptive response by the heart to pressure overload. However, if pressure overload persists, frequently, the heart decompensates and develops 'pathophysiological' hypertrophy. This leads to increased mortality and morbidity and is an independent risk factor for heart failure. Because cardiac myocytes convert this pressure overload into intracellular biochemical signals, blocking this critical signaling pathway may be an important therapeutic target to prevent cardiac hypertrophy. Small GTP-binding proteins, in particular Rac1, have been suggested to play a key role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Recently, 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also called statins, have been shown to inhibit cardiac hypertrophy independent of their cholesterol lowering property. Statins block the isoprenylation and activation of members of the Rho family, such as RhoA and Rac1. Rac1 also regulates NADPH oxidase, which is a major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cardiovascular cells. Growing evidence suggests that ROS may be involved in the process of cardiac hypertrophy and recent research has shown that statins attenuate oxidative stress through inhibition of Rac1. Overall, these pleiotropic effects of statins will give new insights into the process of cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "45": "Despite advances in pharmacological therapies to treat and prevent cardiovascular disease, it remains the leading cause of death in Canada. There now exists a large body of evidence demonstrating that reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) effectively reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite this, a large proportion of patients who would benefit from this intervention are still not achieving the recommended LDL-C levels. The currently available pharmacological agents, especially statins, are very effective but have rare, yet potentially significant, side effects. The likelihood of these side effects is small but does increase with increasing drug dose. As a result, dosages are often not titrated upward because they cannot be tolerated or their side effects are feared by either physicians or patients. Ezetimibe is a new cholesterol absorption inhibitor that is safe and effective in total cholesterol and LDL-C reduction. When used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin, ezetimibe has been shown to reduce LDL-C by an additional 15% to 20% and improve high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides slightly. The addition of ezetimibe to a statin produces an LDL-C reduction of similar magnitude to a three-fold increase in statin dose. The combination of ezetimibe and either atorvastatin or simvastatin has also been found to be beneficial in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The safety profile is similar to placebo and no significant drug interactions have been observed. There is no clinical trial outcome evidence associated with the use of ezetimibe at this time. Thus, ezetimibe is a safe and effective addition to the current LDL-C lowering regimen and is most useful in those patients who cannot achieve sufficient LDL-C reduction with an adequate dose of statin alone, cannot tolerate a statin or are fearful of a statin.",

    "70": "Atorvastatin, a second generation synthetic 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, reduces both intracellular cholesterol synthesis and serum cholesterol levels, and this could have a potential negative impact on gonadal and adrenal steroidogenesis. Hypercholesterolemia in type 2 diabetes, even when mild, must be treated in an aggressive way, due to the more strict therapeutic goals than in the non diabetic population. Since the wide use of 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statins) in type 2 diabetes, the main aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of \"therapeutic\" doses of atorvastatin on gonadal and adrenal hormones in 24 type 2 diabetic patients (16 males and 8 postmenopausal females), with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia (LDL-cholesterol = 150.1 +/- 32.0 and 189.9 +/- 32.9 mg/dl, respectively) studied before and after a 3 months treatment with atorvastatin (20 mg/day). In all patients, lipids and serum cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S), androstendione and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were measured, with the addition, only in males, of testosterone and free testosterone index. After atorvastatin treatment a significant decrease in total and LDL cholesterol was observed (p < 0.05), while HDL-cholesterol did not significantly change ( p = N.S.), as no significant difference was found between steroid hormones measured before and after atorvastatin either in male and females. In conclusion, our data suggest that, in type 2 diabetic patients, the use of atorvastatin has no clinically important effects on either gonadal or adrenal steroid hormones.", 
    "71": "The mevalonate pathway plays a crucial role in regulation of cellular cholesterol synthesis and isoprenoid groups. The entire pathway is closely regulated by feedback from an enzyme in the cascade, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, as well as LDL receptors. Clinically, inhibition of this pathway by statins, potent inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, has been shown to reduce plasma levels of LDL cholesterol and several clinical trials with this group of drugs have demonstrated a remarked improvement in cardiovascular risk reduction. Interestingly, the improvement in cardiovascular end points in those trials was superior to estimations calculated from the effect on LDL cholesterol lowering. These findings support the idea of non-lipid effects of statins in atherosclerosis. Further, recent observations using in vivo and in vitro models of atherosclerosis have shed light on their potential role for manipulation of various cellular functions via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. Among them, recently identified inhibitory effects of statins on monocyte-endothelial interaction suggest their effect on inflammation. Herein, we discuss recent progress in this area of study, with special focus on the biological function of statins.", 
    "72": "Several prospective clinical studies have indicated that hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, statins, prevent cardiovascular events in part through their antiinflammatory properties. Because inflammation is positively and negatively regulated by T helper (Th) 1 cells and Th2 cells, respectively, we examined the effects of statins on the Th polarization in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrated that the statins tested, ie, cerivastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin, promoted Th2 polarization through both inhibition of Th1 development and augmentation of Th2 development of CD4+ T cells primed in vitro with anti-CD3 antibody and splenic antigen-presenting cells. Cerivastatin exerted most potent effect on modulation of Th1/Th2 development, and the effect was completely abrogated by an addition of mevalonate. Consistent with in vitro experiments, cerivastatin treatment decreased IFN-gamma production of lymph node cells from mice immunized with ovalbumin emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, indicating that Th1 development is also suppressed in an in vivo proinflammatory environment. In this murine model, cerivastatin significantly reduced mesangial matrix expansion of glomeruli in the kidney and attenuated proteinuria. The decrease of glomerular sclerosis by cerivastatin treatment was positively related to the suppression of interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing Th1 response in draining lymph node cells. Hence, these findings strongly suggest that statins' inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase regulates Th1/Th2 polarization in vivo and such a mechanism possibly plays a pathophysiological role in immune-related glomerular injury.",

Pravastatin therapy did not cause a significant change in median LDL size-NMR (0.5% increase in pravastatin group vs 0.0% in placebo group; P=0.25). The change in LDL particle concentration with pravastatin correlated inversely with baseline LDL size (r=-0.24; P<0.001) such that the largest reduction in LDL particle concentration-NMR was among those with the smallest LDL size-NMR at baseline (median% change =21.4% for tertile 1 of LDL size, 19.9% for tertile 2, and 16.5% for tertile 3; P=0.03).

Two new therapies, ezetimibe and rosuvastatin, have recently been added to the lipid-lowering armamentarium to improve guideline adherence. Ezetimibe, a novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor, lowers LDL by 18% to 20% and can be used safely in combination with statins. Adding ezetimibe to a statin is comparable with the LDL-lowering efficacy of tripling the dose of the statin. Rosuvastatin is a highly efficacious statin providing 8% greater LDL reduction than equivalent doses of atorvastatin, and the starting dose of 10 mg/d provides nearly a 50% reduction in LDL cholesterol. There are several investigational drugs in development for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis. Of these investigational drugs, the most promising are the cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors, which have the potential to significantly raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and acetyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitors, which may directly inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis.",

Statins decrease dose-dependently low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as well as coronary events and total mortality. Clinical outcome data indicate that for simvastatin the lowest number of treated patients is needed to prevent one major coronary event (NNT 15). Based on an approximately 30% reduction of LDL (valid surrogate parameter) atorvastatin (5 mg/day) and simvastatin (10 mg/day) are the most potent agents whereas 40 mg of lovastatin or pravastatin and 60 mg of fluvastatin are needed to reach this \"therapeutic target\". While all statins share the same mode of action their pharmacokinetic properties and their susceptibility to drug interactions differ slightly. Agents inhibiting CYP3A4 (e.g. grapefruit juice, itraconazole, cyclosporine) should be discouraged if a patient is on atorvastatin, lovastatin or simvastatin. Likewise, fluconazole interferes with the CYP2C9-mediated hepatic elimination of fluvastatin. Moreover, coadministration of gemfibrozil should be avoided because it seems to increase the very low risk for statin-induced rhabdomyolysis. Several statins are available and their equieffective doses have been defined. Selection of a particular drug should be primarily based on clinical outcome data. However, costs and in certain situations the pharmacokinetic profile including the interaction potential of the statins should be taken into account.",

Inflammation appears to be a direct consequence of C5b-9-mediated cell stimulation. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors may exert anti-inflammatory effects on vascular cells independent of lowering plasma cholesterol. Thus, we studied activation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) by C5b-9 focusing on whether inhibition of the HMG-CoA reductase can reduce the proinflammatory effects of C5b-9.C5b-9 in sublytic concentrations increased the proliferation of human VSMCs and induced a time-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Proliferation and ERK1/2 activation could be inhibited by the specific ERK inhibitor PD98059. HMG-CoA inhibition with cerivastatin-reduced VSMC proliferation and C5b-9-induced ERK1/2 activation. Cerivastatin also reduced the C5b-9-induced synthesis of the proinflammatory interleukin-6 (IL-6). Furthermore, C5b-9 induced activation of the transcription factors activator protein- 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which could be inhibited by pretreatment of VSMCs with cerivastatin. L-mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate reversed the inhibitory effects of cerivastatin. The present study in VSMCs shows that cerivastatin inhibits IL-6 synthesis and cell proliferation induced by the terminal complement complex C5b-9. This may be an important mechanism contributing to the beneficial effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors beyond lowering of plasma cholesterol.",

Radiation-stimulated activation of ERKs was attenuated by lovastatin. Cell cycle analyses revealed that the level of gamma-ray-induced G2 blockage was not affected by lovastatin.

Lovastatin enhanced osteoblast differentiation as assessed by a 1.8x increase in expression of Cbfa1/Runx2 and by a 5x increase in osteocalcin promoter activity. Expression of PPARgamma2 was decreased by 60%. By enhancing osteoblast gene expression and by inhibiting adipogenesis, lovastatin may shunt uncommitted osteoprogenitor cells in marrow from the adipocytic to the osteoblastic differentiation pathway. Future evaluation of lovastatin and other lipid-lowering drugs will help determine their potential as therapeutic agents for osteonecrosis and osteoporosis.",

A recent investigation indicated that angiotensin II, a potent activator of NADH/NADPH oxidase, plays an important role in aneurysmal formation. We investigated the potential role of p22phox-based NADH/NADPH oxidase in the pathogenesis of TAA.", 
    "98": "Human thoracic aneurysmal (n=40) and non-aneurysmal (control, n=39) aortic sections were examined, and the localization of p22phox, an essential component of the oxidase, and its expressional differences were investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. In situ reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was examined by the dihydroethidium method, and the impact of medical treatment on p22phox expression was investigated by multiple regression analysis.", 
    "99": "In situ production of ROS and the expression of p22phox increased markedly in TAA throughout the wall, and Western blot confirmed the enhanced expression of p22phox. The expression was more intense in the regions where monocytes/macrophages accumulated. In these inflammatory regions, numerous chymase-positive mast cells and angiotensin converting enzyme-positive macrophages were present. Their localization closely overlapped the in situ activity of matrix metalloproteinase and the expression of p22phox. Multiple regression analysis revealed that medical treatment with statin and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) suppressed p22phox expression in TAA.", 
    "100": "Our findings indicate the role of p22phox-based NADH/NADPH oxidase and the local renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of TAA. Statin and ARB might have inhibitory effects on the formation of aneurysms via the suppression of NADH/NADPH oxidase.", 
    "101": "Patients who survive an acute coronary syndrome are at much higher risk of a recurrent event within the following year than patients with stable coronary syndromes. Risk factor modification, including statin therapy, lowers the risk of recurrent events over many years, but also to reduces the high risk of an another event within the weeks to months following the initial acute coronary syndrome. The mechanisms that contribute to this benefit are likely related to improvements in endothelial function, a decrease in vascular inflammation, and reduced prothrombotic factors. The effects of statins may be mediated by cholesterol reduction, cholesterol-independent effects (particularly by decreasing isoprenoids), and mechanisms that are independent of inhibiting HMG CoA reductase. Observational studies show an early reduction in mortality with statin therapy started before discharge from hospital after an acute coronary syndrome. Several randomized controlled trials also support a rapid reduction in the risk of recurrent events after starting statins during the hospital admission for an acute coronary syndrome. Early statin therapy is also related to improved compliance and use of statins several years after a coronary event. Thus early statin therapy may improve both early and long-term secondary prevention efforts.", 
    "102": "The MTT assay was used to measure the effects of pamidronate, clodronate and mevastatin on the cell viability of Ewing's sarcoma cell lines 6647, CADO-ES-1, ES-2, ES-3, RD-ES, SK-ES-1, STA-ET-2.1 and VH-64. Treatment of these cells with pamidronate inhibited cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After a 72-h incubation period with 50 microM pamidronate, cell numbers were reduced by up to 80%, whereas the monophosphonate analog 3-aminopropyl phosphonate had no effect at concentrations up to 2 mM. Clodronate reduced cell viability by maximally 40% at 1 mM. These data provide the first evidence for a direct growth-inhibitory effect of pamidronate on Ewing's sarcoma cells. Hence, pamidronate definitely merits a more thorough exploration into its potential use in the therapy of patients with Ewing's sarcoma.",

Whether statins exert effects within 24 hours on the coronary vasculature in patients with endothelial dysfunction has not been elucidated. Twenty-seven patients with stable angina pectoris and average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations of 138+/-9 mg/dL at baseline were allocated to treatment with placebo (14 patients) or 40 mg/d pravastatin (13 patients) in a randomized, double-blind, prospective trial. Coronary endothelial function was assessed before and 24 hours after single treatment by quantitative coronary angiography during intracoronary infusion of nitroglycerin or increasing concentrations of acetylcholine (0.01, 0.1, and 1 micromol/L). Coronary blood flow reserve was measured by Doppler velocimetry during adenosine infusion. Intracoronary acetylcholine infusion induced abnormal vasoconstriction in both groups before treatment, indicating coronary endothelial dysfunction. Treatment with a single oral 40-mg dose of pravastatin significantly attenuated acetylcholine-mediated vasoconstriction after 24 hours (mean+/-SE decrease in luminal diameter before and after treatment: 0.01 micromol/L, 6.1+/-2.2% versus 3.0+/-1.2%; 0.1 micromol/L, 15.6+/-2.6% versus 7.4+/-1.8%; P<0.05; 1 micromol/L, 22.9+/-2.9% versus 13.2+/-2.6%; P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the response to acetylcholine in the placebo group (8.1+/-2.4% versus 9.7+/-2.4%, 16.1+/-2.9% versus 16.8+/-3.2%, and 21.4+/-3.9% versus 23.3+/-4.2%). The response to nitroglycerin infusion was not altered in both groups. Increase in coronary blood flow in response to adenosine and coronary flow reserve remained unchanged during placebo and statin treatment. Serum concentrations of blood lipids and high-sensitive C-reactive protein were not significantly altered after 24 hours in response to placebo or pravastatin therapy. Statin treatment improves endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion within 24 hours in the absence of significant cholesterol reduction.

Furthermore, the percentage of subjects who showed pharmacokinetic differences was determined. A single oral dose of pravastatin 10 mg was administered to 84 Japanese healthy male subjects. Serum concentrations of pravastatin were measured for 8 hours postdose. Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak concentration (Cmax) were determined as primary evaluation parameters. An outlier was defined as follows: Outlier 1 < Q1 - (Q3 - Q1) x 1.5 or Q3+(Q3-Q1) x 1.5 < Outlier 1, Outlier 2 < Q1 - (Q3 - Q1) x 3 or Q3+ (Q3-Q1) x 3 < Outlier 2. Subjects who were outliers were regarded as having an individual difference in pharmacokinetic behavior. In AUC and Cmax, 4 of 84 subjects (4.8%) were higher outliers. Of these 4 subjects, 2 were high outliers in both AUC and Cmax. No subjects were low outliers. It was concluded that a significant individual difference in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin was observed in 4.8% of the subjects (4/84).",

Although some epidemiological observations raise doubts to the effectiveness of statins for AD, many in vitro and clinical studies insist on the effectiveness of statins decreasing amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels in medium or blood. To explore the effect of pravastatin on Abeta production, we followed the longitudinal plasma levels of both Abeta 40 and Abeta 42 during the allocation of pravastatin in 46 patients with hyperlipidemia. We found no correlation between plasma cholesterol levels or the decreasing values of total cholesterol and those of Abeta 40 or Abeta 42. Patients having Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) had higher low-density lipoprotein levels and lower Abeta 40 levels in plasma, suggesting ApoE4 seems to influence plasma Abeta levels via cholesterol metabolism.",

The beneficial effects of statins were first assumed to result from their ability to reduce cholesterol synthesis and improve serum lipid profiles. In recent years, however, numerous pleiotropic effects of statins on atherosclerotic lesions have been described. In this review, we summarize the actions of statins on different aspects of atherosclerotic plaque development. These include endothelial dysfunction, leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, smooth muscle cell activation/proliferation, and finally plaque rupture and thrombosis.",

Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia may have detrimental influences on the arterial wall. Statins (may also) inhibit insulin signal transferring in vascular smooth cell cultures. However, their effect on insulin sensitivity remains controversial. Therefore, we decided to investigate the effect of simvastatin on insulin sensitivity in hypercholesterolemic patients.",

On the other hand, lag-phase of plasma LDL oxidation was minimal in coronary patients with primary hypercholesterolemia without familial history and especially in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. This can be attributed to sharply decreased content of natural lipid antioxidants in LDL of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. However, therapy with natural antioxidant vitamin E did not modulate oxidizability of these LDL. By contrast, therapy with beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor suppressing biosynthesis of ubiphenol Q induced sharp accumulation of lipoperoxides in LDL in vivo. These data suggest that reduced form of ubiquinone Q is the main antioxidant protecting LDL from free-radical oxidation.",

    "121": "Hypercholesterolaemia is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic disease. Atorvastatin lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. The mean dose-response relationship has been shown to be log-linear for atorvastatin, but plasma concentrations of atorvastatin acid and its metabolites do not correlate with LDL-cholesterol reduction at a given dose. The clinical dosage range for atorvastatin is 10-80 mg/day, and it is given in the acid form. Atorvastatin acid is highly soluble and permeable, and the drug is completely absorbed after oral administration. However, atorvastatin acid is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism in the gut wall as well as in the liver, as oral bioavailability is 14%. The volume of distribution of atorvastatin acid is 381L, and plasma protein binding exceeds 98%. Atorvastatin acid is extensively metabolised in both the gut and liver by oxidation, lactonisation and glucuronidation, and the metabolites are eliminated by biliary secretion and direct secretion from blood to the intestine. In vitro, atorvastatin acid is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) C and H+-monocarboxylic acid cotransporter. The total plasma clearance of atorvastatin acid is 625 mL/min and the half-life is about 7 hours. The renal route is of minor importance (<1%) for the elimination of atorvastatin acid. In vivo, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is responsible for the formation of two active metabolites from the acid and the lactone forms of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin acid and its metabolites undergo glucuronidation mediated by uridinediphosphoglucuronyltransferases 1A1 and 1A3. Atorvastatin can be given either in the morning or in the evening. Food decreases the absorption rate of atorvastatin acid after oral administration, as indicated by decreased peak concentration and increased time to peak concentration. Women appear to have a slightly lower plasma exposure to atorvastatin for a given dose. Atorvastatin is subject to metabolism by CYP3A4 and cellular membrane transport by OATP C and P-glycoprotein, and drug-drug interactions with potent inhibitors of these systems, such as itraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, cyclosporin, fibrates, erythromycin and grapefruit juice, have been demonstrated. An interaction with gemfibrozil seems to be mediated by inhibition of glucuronidation. A few case studies have reported rhabdomyolysis when the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin have been affected by interacting drugs. Atorvastatin increases the bioavailability of digoxin, most probably by inhibition of P-glycoprotein, but does not affect the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir, nelfinavir or terfenadine.", 
    "122": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis and lead to a significant reduction of plasma lipid concentrations. As a clear correlation exists between serum cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, statins have become increasingly important in current preventive medicine. Studies prompted by the extraordinary benefits afforded by these drugs have reported minimal changes in the vasculature of hypercholesterolemic patients when compared with clinical benefits and have led to further investigations to determine the underlying reasons for these clinical benefits. The purpose of this review is to present the wide array of systems that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are known to influence, which range from adverse events due to coronary artery disease, stroke risk, platelet function, endothelial function, and inflammatory effects to intracellular signaling pathways that control vascular cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation.", 
    "123": "Several studies have shown that simvastatin induces apoptosis in a variety of cell lines including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), but the exactly mechanisms involved in it is not very clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms and signal pathways involved in apoptosis induced by simvastatin. When exposed to 30 microM simvastatin, [Ca2+]i in VSMCs increased with time and reached to 336 +/- 52 nM at 6 h, more than four-fold of control (P<0.01, n=5). Verapamil (80 microM), a membrane voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker, attenuated simvastatin-induced augmentation of free calcium concentration from 336 +/- 52 nM to 144 +/- 34 nM (P<0.01). After being exposed to 30 microM simvastatin for 8 h, calpain activity markedly increased (P<0.05, n=4) and reached to more than three-fold of control at 12 h (P<0.01). Caspase-3 was also activated by simvastatin after 12 h. Verapamil and PD150606, a cell-permeable selective calpain inhibitor, significantly inhibited simvastatin-induced augmentation of calpain activity and blocked caspase-3 activation, respectively. Furthermore, 80 microM verapamil and 100 microM PD150606 decreased simvastatin-induced apoptosis rate from 24.2 +/- 1.7% to 7.9 +/- 0.6% (P<0.01, n=4) and 9.5 +/- 1.9% (P<0.01), respectively and also prevented simvastatin-induced DNA laddering. In conclusion, we indicated that simvastatin increases cytosolic free calcium concentration mainly through calcium influx from extracellular solution and then induces apoptosis by activating caspase-3 via calcium-dependent protease calpain.",

    "128": "The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that by 2020 tobacco will become the largest single health problem worldwide and will cause an estimated 8.4 million deaths annually (http://www5.who.int/tobacco/). Although the impact of smoking on human health is well defined from the medical point of view, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms by which tobacco smoke mediates its disastrous effects. Here, we demonstrate that tobacco smoke dramatically changes vascular endothelial cell and tissue morphology, leading to a loss of endothelial barrier function within minutes. Long-term exposure of endothelial cells to tobacco smoke extracts induces necrosis that may trigger a pro-inflammatory status of the vessel wall. Pre-incubation of the extracts without cells for 6 h at 37 degrees C led to a complete loss of activity. Further, the endothelium could be rescued by changing to fresh medium even at times when the extracts had lost their activity. Finally, we show that N-acetyl cysteine and statins inhibit the adverse tobacco smoke effects.", 
    "129": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important cause of death in kidney transplant recipients. Future CVD mortality was estimated by a risk calculator in all patients (n = 439) with a functioning transplant (>6 months), followed at our center. In addition to CURRENT mortality rates, an OPTIMAL rate (adding anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy in uncontrolled patients) and an HISTORIC rate (higher systolic blood pressures and the absence of statin use in our population 5 years ago) were also calculated. Overall, the predicted CURRENT CVD mortality rates are 0.82 (95% CI 0.81-0.83) of HISTORIC rates. Predicted OPTIMAL CVD mortality rates are 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.92) of CURRENT rates. To achieve OPTIMAL rates, a 27% increase in blood pressure and lipid-lowering drug use is required. There were few contraindications to these medications, implying that physician prescribing was the major barrier to minimizing risk. Despite OPTIMAL rates, the transplant population's relative risk is 2.3 (median, 95% CI 2.1-2.5) times higher than that in the general population. Therefore, targeted therapy to reduce CVD risk can have substantial benefit, but CVD mortality may continue to exceed that in the general population.", 
    "130": "Despite the availability of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia since 1988, most patients do not achieve their target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) goals. With the publication of the most recent guidelines (ATP III), which contain more aggressive treatment recommendations, the cholesterol treatment gap is likely to widen further. Factors responsible for patients not receiving adequate treatment include a lack of focus on asymptomatic diseases, time and reimbursement constraints, inadequate training, a reluctance to prescribe aggressive treatment regimens, and poor communication among health care professionals. Results of several studies evaluating intervention programs indicate that pharmacists can play a key role in improving cholesterol management whether in lipid clinics, community pharmacies, or hospitals. In these intervention programs, pharmacists provided a wide range of functions that included reviewing the medical history, monitoring laboratory values, selecting lipid-lowering therapies, and educating patients regarding drug therapies and the importance of compliance. These interventions produced significant improvements in lipid parameters and in the number of patients who achieved LDL treatment goals. Most important, these interventions were associated with decreases in clinical events. Pharmacist intervention also was highly cost-effective and time efficient. These results suggest that pharmacists are in a unique position and possess the requisite skills to improve the treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "131": "Statins are the principal agents for managing hyperlipidemia because of their ability to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and triglyceride levels, increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels slightly, and decrease clinical events. Nevertheless, not all patients can tolerate the statins or achieve their treatment goals with these drugs. In addition, available statins have only modest effects on HDL, and clinical events still occur despite the best current lipid-lowering agents. Thus, new lipid-lowering agents are required to improve clinical outcomes. These recently or soon to be released agents are stanol esters, which can be incorporated into spreads and other foods and reduce LDL levels up to 15%; colesevelam, a new bile acid sequestrant with a higher potency, fewer adverse effects, and less drug interactions than those of older agents in this class; rosuvastatin, a new statin that reduces LDL levels and increases HDL levels at least more effectively than atorvastatin; and a new class of agents that inhibit cholesterol absorption and are likely to be used in combination with statins. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol apheresis is another, nonpharmacologic option for patients with severe hyperlipidemia despite maximal medical therapy.", 
    "132": "Considerable data on the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and treatment of dyslipidemia-induced coronary heart disease (CHD) have accumulated in recent years. These data have been assessed and incorporated into the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on the Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel [ATP] III). A major focus of the new guidelines is the assessment of the near-term (i.e., 10-yr) risk of experiencing a CHD event and matching the intensity of treatment to this risk. Patients with diabetes and those with a greater than 20% 10-year risk of experiencing a CHD event have been elevated to the risk level of CHD equivalent. The ATP III guidelines also modify several lipid and lipoprotein classifications. A low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) level below 100 mg/dl is now considered optimum for all individuals. In addition, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and triglyceride cutoff points have been modified to reflect more accurately the risk associated with abnormalities in these lipoproteins. As with the previous guidelines, the primary target of therapy remains LDL. Therapeutic lifestyle changes consisting of diet, weight reduction, and increased physical activity should be included in all treatment regimens. Based on their potent LDL-lowering properties and their proven ability to decrease mortality in a variety of patient populations, statins are generally the first choice for pharmacologic therapy. A secondary target of therapy includes non-HDL goals for patients with high triglyceride levels and the metabolic syndrome, which is characterized by abdominal obesity, elevated triglyceride levels, low HDL levels, and insulin resistance. Management of these secondary targets includes weight reduction and increased physical activity, and treatment of the lipid and nonlipid risk factors. Overall, ATP III represents an aggressive approach to treating dyslipidemia, greatly extending the number of individuals who qualify for treatment.", 
    "133": "Kinetics of apo B and apo AI were assessed in 8 patients with mixed hyperlipidemia at baseline and after 8 weeks of atorvastatin 80 mg q.d. and micronised fenofibrate 200 mg q.d. in a cross-over study. Both increased hepatic production and decreased catabolism of VLDL accounted for elevated cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations at baseline. Atorvastatin significantly decreased triglyceride, total, VLDL and LDL cholesterol and apo B concentrations (-65%, -36%, -57%, -40% and -33%, respectively, P<0.05). Kinetic analysis revealed that atorvastatin stimulated the catabolism of apo B containing lipoproteins, enhanced the delipidation of VLDL1 and decreased VLDL1 production. Fenofibrate lowered triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol (-57% and -64%, respectively, P<0.05) due to enhanced delipidation of VLDL1 and VLDL2 and increased VLDL1 catabolism. Changes of HDL particle composition accounted for the increase of HDL cholesterol during atorvastatin and fenofibrate (18% and 23%, P<0.01). Only fenofibrate increased apo AI concentrations through enhanced apo AI synthesis (45%, P<0.05). We conclude that atorvastatin exerts additional beneficial effects on the metabolism of apo B containing lipoproteins unrelated to an increase in LDL receptor activity. Fenofibrate but not atorvastatin increases apo AI production and plasma turnover.",

As a result the relative clopidogrel induced platelet inhibition (P-selectin-expression) is diminished--but still there is a relative clopidogrel effect of more than 80% in the maintenance phase. It may be reasonable to test the therapeutic efficacy of clopidogrel in those patients who require long-term treatment.", 
    "138": "Exposure to second hand smoke (SHS) is believed to cause lung cancer. Pathological angiogenesis is a requisite for tumor growth. Lewis lung cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into mice, which were then exposed to sidestream smoke (SHS) or clean room air and administered vehicle, cerivastatin, or mecamylamine. SHS significantly increased tumor size, weight, capillary density, VEGF and MCP-1 levels, and circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). Cerivastatin (an inhibitor of HMG-coA reductase) or mecamylamine (an inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) suppressed the effect of SHS to increase tumor size and capillary density. Cerivastatin reduced MCP-1 levels, whereas mecamylamine reduced VEGF levels and EPC. These studies reveal that SHS promotes tumor angiogenesis and growth. These effects of SHS are associated with increases in plasma VEGF and MCP-1 levels, and EPC, mediated in part by isoprenylation and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.", 
    "139": "To investigate the connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA expression in the renal cortex of 5/6 nephrectomized rats and its modulation by fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor.", 
    "140": "Twenty-four rats underwent operation 2 times: during the first operation 2/3 of the left kidney was resected, and the right kidney was resected completely one week after. The 24 5/6 nephrectomized rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: untreated 5/6 nephrectomized group (model group, n=12) and fluvastatin-treated 5/6 nephrectomized group (treatment group, fluvastatin was orally administered 7 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) for 13 weeks, n=12), and 6 sham-operated rats served as control (sham operation group). In the weeks 2, 4, 8, and 13 after the second operation metabolic cage was used to collect the 24-hour urine 2 times. Urine protein was examined by biuret reaction so as to calculate urinary protein excretion. By the end of experiment blood was collected to examine the serum cholesterol, triglyceride, urea nitrogen, and creatinine contents. The rats were killed and their kidneys taken out. The CTGF mRNA expression in the renal cortex was detected by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), type IV collagen and fibronectin in the glomeruli. Renal pathological changes and glomerular sclerosis index (GSI) were evaluated as well.", 
    "141": "At the end of the experiment, the mean urinary protein excretion in the model group was 305.4 mg/24 h, significantly higher than that in the treatment group (230.9 mg/24 h, P<0.01) and the sham operation group (5.6 mg/24 h, P<0.01) The serum urea nitrogen of the model group was (24.5 +/- 4.9) mmol/L, significantly higher than that of the treatment group [(15.8 +/- 3.9) mmol/L, P<0.05] and that of the sham-operated group (7.4 +/- 0.3 mmol/L, P<0.01). The serum creatinine (P<0.05) of the model group was 88 micromol/L +/- 14 micromol/L, significantly higher than that of the treatment group [(58 +/- 5) micromol/L, P<0.05)] and that of the sham-operated group [(54 +/- 5) micromol/L, P<0.05]. The creatinine clearance rate of the model group was (1.7 +/- 0.7) ml.min(-1).kg(-1), significantly lower than that of the treated group [(3.2 +/- 1.1) ml.min(-1).kg(-1), P<0.05] and that of the sham-operated group [(3.9 +/- 1.5) ml.min(-1).kg(-1), P<0.05]. The glomerular sclerosis index (GSI) in the model group was 41.8 +/- 11.5, significantly higher than that in the sham operation group (2.2 +/- 1.3, P<0.01) and the treatment group (23.4 +/- 6.1, P<0.05). The mean optical density of CTGF mRNA expression in the renal cortex of the model group was a 3 times that of the sham operation group, and the mean optical density of CTGF mRNA expression in the renal cortex of the treatment group was lower by 55.4% compared with that of the model group (P<0.01). The glomerular expressions of TGF-beta1, type IV collagen and fibronectin were significantly up-regulated in the model group in comparison with those in the sham operation group (all P<0.01). The glomerular protein expressions of TGF-beta1, type IV collagen and fibronectin were significantly weaker in the fluvastatin treatment group as compared with the model group (all P<0.01).", 
    "142": "CTGF mRNA expression is markedly upregulated in the renal cortex of 5/6 nephrectomized rats. Fluvastatin suppresses the increased CTGF mRNA expression in renal cortex and ameliorates the glomerular extracellular matrix accumulation.", 
    "143": "To evaluate clinicofunctional and morphological changes in the liver of patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia and in the course of treatment with statins.", 
    "144": "A general clinical examination, biochemical hepatic tests, determination of blood lipid spectrum, markers of viral hepatites B, C, G, TT, ultrasound hepatic imaging of the liver of bile ducts, punch biopsy of the liver were made in 60 patients (38 females and 22 males) at the age of 39 to 70 years with atherogenic dyslipidemia (ADL).", 
    "145": "Biochemical tests showed high activity of transaminases (1.5-2 times higher than normal) in 16 patients, hyperbilirubinemia in 12 patients, dyslipidemia of type IIb-III in all the examinees. Ultrasound investigation of the liver has found fat dystrophy in 58, cholesterosis of the gallbladder in 32, cholelithiasis in 17 patients. Histological examination of the liver evidenced for marked fat dystrophy of hepatocytes, perihepatocellular and periportal fibrosis, moderate portal and periportal hepatitis. 22 of 54 patients treated with statins appeared to have morphological signs of drug damage to the liver.", 
    "146": "ADL patients' livers are characterized by signs of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In its presence stains treatment leads to development of drug-related hepatic disorder--statin hepatitis. Therefore, hypolipidemic drugs in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis must be used individually or alternative treatments should be tried.", 
    "147": "Statins are used widely to reduce the levels of low-density lipoproteins and cholesterol and thereby lower the incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. They achieve this through their ability to limit the production of mevalonate via blockade of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. This enzyme is the rate limiting step controlling the de novo production of cholesterol. It is now clear from a number of studies in various animal models of neuroinflammation as well as in in vitro cell trafficking studies, that statins significantly attenuate both the clinical symptoms of neuroinflammation and the associated infiltration of inflammatory cells into the CNS. It has been known for some time that statins have additional effects, which appear independent of their cholesterol lowering action. Although the precise mechanism by which statins are able to exert this inhibitory effect on leukocyte infiltration and consequential neuroinflammatory disease is presently unclear, a number of potential mechanisms have been proposed.", 
    "148": "We investigated the effects of pravastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, using an animal model of chronic cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced nephropathy. Sprague-Dawley rats were maintained on a low-salt diet (0.05% sodium) and treated daily for 1 or 4 wk with vehicle (olive oil; 1 ml/kg sc), CsA (15 mg/kg sc), or both CsA and pravastatin (5 or 20 mg/kg in the drinking water). Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects of pravastatin were studied by evaluating the concentrations of the inflammatory mediators osteopontin (OPN) and C-reactive protein (CRP), of fibrotic cytokine-transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, and the presence of ED-1-positive cells (macrophages). In addition, renal function, serum lipid levels, histopathology (arteriolopathy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis), and the expression of the vasoactive factors endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and renin protein were also compared for different treatment groups. Pravastatin induced dose-dependent decreases in the expression of OPN, intrarenal CRP, and TGF-beta1, and in the numbers of ED-1-positive cells at 1 and 4 wk. These were accompanied by a significant attenuation of tubulointerstitial fibrosis at 4 wk. The downregulation of eNOS protein expression in CsA-treated rat kidney was markedly upregulated by pravastatin treatment, although intrarenal renin expression was unaffected. Renal dysfunction induced by CsA significantly improved with administration of pravastatin at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Neither CsA nor pravastatin influenced serum lipid or high-sensitivity CRP levels in the treatment groups. Thus in chronic CsA nephropathy, pravastatin effectively abrogates the progression of tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. This may support the clinical use of pravastatin.", 
    "149": "The concept of plaque stabilisation was developed to explain how medications could decrease adverse coronary events without a substantial reduction in the regression of atherosclerosis. With this concept, a comprehensive view of atherosclerosis is now appreciated. A number of imaging modalities are employed to study atherosclerosis; most identify luminal diameter or stenosis, wall thickness and plaque volume. A number of antiatherosclerotic agents have been studied as well to prove this hypothesis. However, the ultimate goal of medical treatment is to cure or prevent diseases caused by atherosclerosis.", 
    "150": "To provide an evidence-based overview of drug treatment for long-term secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI).", 
    "151": "We conducted searches of MEDLINE (1966-August 2002), the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, and the reference list of each identified study.", 
    "152": "Trials and meta-analyses were included using the following criteria: (1) randomized trials, (2) description of identification procedure, inclusion criteria, outcome measures, and statistical methods, (3) confirmed MIs, (4) treatment continued for at least 1 month, and (5) all-cause mortality as primary outcome; other events as secondary outcomes. All authors interpreted the results from trials that met the inclusion criteria.", 
    "153": "In randomized clinical trials, low-dose aspirin, high-intensity oral anticoagulants, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and statins decreased the risk of mortality and reinfarction after MI. Randomized clinical trials using calcium-channel blockers, antiarrhythmics, and hormone replacement therapy did not show benefits in patients with prior MI. Effects of the combined use of aspirin or oral anticoagulants with beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors plus statins must be derived from subgroup analysis of trials, but seem to be beneficial.", 
    "154": "The use of at least aspirin or an oral anticoagulant, a beta-blocker or an ACE inhibitor, plus a statin should be incorporated in the treatment routine. Clopidogrel treatment might be an alternative to aspirin. Standard addition of a beta-blocker to ACE inhibitor-treated patients without reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction seems to be untimely.", 
    "155": "Two methods, spectrophotometry and HPLC, were compared in the analyses of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HL) activity in three unrelated Czech patients with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric (HMG) aciduria and their family members. The HL activities in cultured fibroblasts and/or isolated lymphocytes of probands were below the detection limits of the methods used. Both methods were also suitable for recognition of all heterozygotes in affected families. We searched for pathogenic mutations in the HL gene. Molecular analyses revealed that two patients are homozygous for known mutation H233R and R41Q, respectively, whereas the third patient is a compound heterozygote for the mutation H233R and a novel mutation Pro9fs(-1). This study expands the knowledge of the genotypic variability of the HMG aciduria.", 
    "156": "The benefits of statin therapy in cardiovascular medicine are ascribed to its lipid-lowering effect as well as its anti-inflammatory properties. Whereas all statins have been shown to reduce cholesterol plasma levels, their effect on inflammatory markers has been inconsistent. Here, we show that statins differ markedly in their effectiveness in preventing activation of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor involved in the activation of immediately early genes during inflammation.", 
    "157": "Six statins (atorvastatin (Atv), cerivastatin (Cer), fluvastatin (Flu), lovastatin (Lov), pravastatin (Pra), simvastatin (Sim)) were tested for their ability to influence the induction of NF-kappaB in human monocytes (Mo) during inflammation. Mo isolated from healthy blood donors were incubated with LPS (10 microg/ml) in the presence and absence of statin (0.001-5 microM). NF-kappaB binding activity (EMSA), degradation and phosphorylation of the inhibitor protein IkappaB-alpha (Western blotting), tissue factor (TF) mRNA (rtPCR), and TF activity (clotting assay) were analyzed.", 
    "158": "All statins inhibited LPS-induced NF-kappaB binding activity in Mo in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was due to reduced phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor protein IkappaB, and was primarily dependent on the absence of mevalonate. Whilst this effect appeared with all statins, there were marked differences in the degree of inhibition between the statins. Cer (45 +/- 9% inhibition, p < 0.05) was 9-fold more effective in reducing NF-kappaB activation than Flu (5 +/- 10% inhibition). The differences in the potency of statins (Cer > Atv > Sim > Pra > Lov > Flu) were also reflected at the transcriptional level and the protein level of NF-kappaB controlled tissue factor expression.", 
    "159": "The finding that statins differ in their potency in interfering with the activation of NF-kappaB signaling in human monocytes further supports the hypothesis that some statins inhibit the inflammatory response more than others.", 
    "160": "Most patients who should be on lipid-lowering therapy are not receiving it, and most patients who are receiving it are not reaching their appropriate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) goals. This is in part because physicians and patients fear side effects of statins and other lipid-lowering agents. Ezetimibe (Zetia), a new lipid-lowering drug, may help physicians close this \"treatment gap\" in more patients, especially in combination with a statin.", 
    "161": "We investigated signal transduction pathways for LTD4 in the human promonocytic cell line U937 known, upon differentiation, to express CysLT1 receptors. We confirmed the presence of high-affinity binding sites for 3H-LTD4, which, in functional studies, displayed the features of CysLT1 receptor. In fact, three potent and selective CysLT1 receptor antagonists were able to completely inhibit LTD4-induced response. In turn, cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) increase (EC50 = 3.4 nM +/- 27% CV) was only partially sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTx) as well as to the prenylation inhibitor fluvastatin and to the specific geranylgeranylation and farnesylation inhibitors BAL 9504 and FPT II. Finally, Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, inhibitor of the Ras family of GTPases, and FTS, a potent methyltransferase inhibitor, were both able to partially inhibit LTD4-induced [Ca2+] increase, suggesting a role for a Ras family member in [Ca2+]i regulation. In conclusion, in dU937 LTD4 signal transduction involves: (a) at least two pathways, one sensitive and one insensitive to PTx; (b) isoprenylated proteins, such as betagamma subunits and, possibly, a small G protein of the Ras family.", 
    "162": "Despite the development of effective immunosuppressive therapy, transplant graft arterial disease (GAD) remains the major limitation to long-term graft survival. The interplay between host inflammatory cells and donor vascular wall cells results in an intimal hyperplastic lesion, which leads to ischemia and graft failure. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce GAD in human cardiac allografts, although it is unclear whether this is secondary to cholesterol lowering or other mechanisms. This study tested the hypothesis that statins can suppress GAD by cholesterol-independent pathways.", 
    "163": "We performed heterotopic murine cardiac transplants in total allogeneic or major histocompatibility complex class II-mismatched combinations. Transplanted animals received either control chow, chow containing 25 ppm cerivastatin (low dose), or chow containing 125 ppm cerivastatin (high dose). Mean plasma cerivastatin concentrations were 0.0 (control), 10.1 (low dose), and 21.9 (high dose) nmol/L, respectively. Plasma cholesterol levels were the same in all groups. GAD scores decreased in low-dose (P<0.05) and high-dose (P<0.0001) cerivastatin groups compared with controls, with concomitant reduction in graft-infiltrating cells and significantly decreased intragraft RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 mRNA expression. Cerivastatin, as well as other statins, also reduced RANTES and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production in mouse endothelial cells stimulated with interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in vitro.", 
    "164": "Clinically achievable levels of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor attenuate GAD in murine heart transplants, diminish host inflammatory cell recruitment, and do not alter cholesterol levels. These results indicate that statins can affect arterial biology and inflammation independently of their effects on cholesterol metabolism."
