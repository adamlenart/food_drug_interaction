    "5": "The authors investigated whether SLCO1B1 polymorphisms contribute to variability in pravastatin pharmacokinetics when pravastatin is administered alone versus with darunavir/ritonavir. HIV-negative healthy participants were prospectively enrolled on the basis of SLCO1B1 diplotype: group 1 (*1A/*1A, n = 9); group 2 (*1A/*1B, n = 10; or *1B/*1B, n = 2); and group 3 (*1A/*15, n = 1; *1B/*15, n = 5; or *1B/*17, n = 1). Participants received pravastatin (40 mg) daily on days 1 through 4, washout on days 5 through 11, darunavir/ritonavir (600/100 mg) twice daily on days 12 through 18, with pravastatin 40 mg added back on days 15 through 18. Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted on day 4 (pravastatin alone) and day 18 (pravastatin + darunavir/ritonavir). Pravastatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(tau)) was 21% higher during administration with darunavir/ritonavir compared with pravastatin alone; however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = .11). Group 3 variants had 96% higher pravastatin AUC(tau) on day 4 and 113% higher pravastatin AUC(tau) on day 18 compared with group 1. The relative change in pravastatin pharmacokinetics was largest in group 3 but did not differ significantly between diplotype groups. In sum, the influence of SLCO1B1*15 and *17 haplotypes on pravastatin pharmacokinetics was maintained in the presence of darunavir/ritonavir. Because OATP1B1 inhibition would be expected to be greater in carriers of normal or high-functioning SLCO1B1 haplotypes, these findings suggest that darunavir/ritonavir is not a potent inhibitor of OATP1B1-mediated pravastatin transport in vivo.", 
    "6": "The previous large retrospective studies demonstrated that treatment with Statins reduces both the incidence of prostate cancer by 50% and serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level up to 40%. However the main problem in those studies was the absence of control groups of men with hypercholesterolemia without Statin treatment. We performed a small prospective controlled clinical trial to assess the influence of the treatment with Atorvastatin on serum PSA in men with hypercholesterolemia referred to our educational and treatment center from October 2007 to March 2008. In this study, among the newly diagnosed males with hypercholesterolemia (LDL > 130 mg/dl), 40 patients with LDL more than 190 mg/dl were selected as a case group and were treated with Atorvastatin (20 mg/day). Among the same population and in the same period, another 40 patients with LDL between 130 and 190 mg/dl were selected as first control group and were treated only with low fat diet. Another 40 patients with normal serum cholesterol and without any treatment were selected as second control group. The lipid profile and serum PSA level of patients of all groups were tested at the first and third months after the therapy. After completion of data, the mean serum lipids and PSA level were measured in both visits and compared with each other by paired t-test. Also the mean PSA change in two visits between three groups was compared by ANOVA and Tukey HSD test. There was not any significant difference in mean baseline PSA between hypercholesterolemic and normocholesterolemic patients (P=0.547). In case group, mean PSA and LDL was reduced by 14.1% (P=0.0001) and 30% (P=0.0001) respectively by second visit. In first control group, mean PSA was not changed significantly (P=0.337), whereas mean LDL in this group was reduced by 9.6% (P= 0.0001). Similarly in the second control group mean PSA was not changed significantly (P=0.309) by second visit. In addition, mean change of PSA in case group was compared with first and second control groups that was significantly different (P=0.0001) whereas mean change of PSA between two control groups was not significantly different (P=0.615). The results of this study showed that: 1) Short term treatment with Atorvastatin can reduce serum PSA level, and 2) This reduction is more likely to be due to direct effect and is not related to lowering serum cholesterol levels. Thus, if results of this study are confirmed by large prospective randomized clinical trials with longer follow up period, it will be possible that Atorvastatin could be used in long term as a safe chemoprophylactic agent against prostate cancer in high risk patients.", 
    "7": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by synaptic loss and cognitive impairments. The presence of extracellular senile plaques (mainly composed of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide) is an important molecular hallmark in AD and neuronal damage has been attributed, at least in part, to A\u03b2-mediated toxicity. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD are not yet completely understood, several lines of evidence indicate that oxidative stress and cholesterol dyshomeostasis play crucial roles in mediating the synaptic loss and cognitive deficits observed in AD patients. This study evaluated the effects of Probucol, a phenolic lipid-lowering agent with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, on biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress and synaptic function (hippocampal glutathione and synaptophysin levels; glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and acetylcholinesterase activities; lipid peroxidation), as well as on behavioral parameters related to the cognitive function (displaced and new object recognition tasks) in A\u03b2-exposed mice. Animals were treated with a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of aggregated A\u03b2(1-40) (400 pmol/site) and, subsequently, received Probucol (10 mg/kg, i.p.) once a day, during the following 2 weeks. At the end of treatments, A\u03b2(1-40)-exposed animals showed a significant impairment on learning-memory ability, which was paralleled by a significant decrease in hippocampal synaptophysin levels, as well as by an increase in hippocampal acetylcholinesterase activity. Importantly, Probucol treatment blunted the deleterious effects of A\u03b2(1-40) on learning-memory ability and hippocampal biochemistry. Although A\u03b2(1-40) treatment did not change hippocampal glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, A\u03b2(1-40)-exposed animals showed increased hippocampal lipid peroxidation and this event was completely blunted by Probucol treatment. These findings reinforce and extend the notion of the hazardous effects of A\u03b2(1-40) toward hippocampal synaptic homeostasis and cognitive functions. In addition, the present results indicate that Probucol is able to counteract the cognitive and biochemical impairments induced by i.c.v. A\u03b2(1-40) administration in mice. The study is the first to report the protective effects of Probucol (a \"non-statin cholesterol-lowering drug\") against A\u03b2(1-40)-induced synaptic and behavioral impairments, rendering this compound a promising molecule for further pharmacological studies on the search for therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent AD.",

Thirty-four patients with low HDL cholesterol and high triglyceride (dyslipidemia) and 35 patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride at target levels (normolipidemia) were studied. Twenty healthy men were also studied. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured using immunonephelometry, insulin using a radioimmunometric assay, and total adiponectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell cholesterol efflux to serum and total isolated HDL was assayed using rat hepatoma Fu5AH cells for scavenger receptor class B type 1-mediated efflux. Compared to the normolipidemia and healthy groups, and after adjustment for age and waist circumference, patients with dyslipidemia showed higher fasting insulin (14, 9.9, and 8.5 \u03bcU/ml, respectively), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values (3.4, 2.3, and 1.8, respectively), lower adiponectin concentrations (5.1, 8.1, and 11 \u03bcg/ml, respectively), and reduced cholesterol efflux to serum (14%, 15%, and 19%, respectively) and to HDL fractions (4.4%, 4.6%, and 5.6%, respectively) (p <0.05 for all variables). Multivariate analysis showed that adiponectin and apolipoprotein A1 accounted for 10.7% and 3.9%, respectively, of the variance in cholesterol efflux. In conclusion, the decreased cholesterol efflux and metabolic abnormalities found in the dyslipidemia group may contribute to the residual risk observed in the large statin trials and the higher morbidity and mortality in statin-treated coronary patients with low HDL cholesterol even when attaining low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <70 mg/dl.", 
    "32": "Greater acculturation has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease in Hispanics. C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, is known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Whether acculturation is associated with CRP levels in Hispanics has not been established. We examined the association between acculturation and CRP in 11,858 Hispanic-American adults participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 to 2008. Acculturation was measured by the Short Acculturation Scale (SAS), a validated language-based scale. We used multivariate linear regression to examine the independent association between acculturation and CRP after adjusting for clinical and demographic covariates and appropriate sampling weights. We back-transformed the beta coefficients into relative differences (RDs). Higher acculturation was independently associated with higher CRP levels in Hispanics. Compared to those less acculturated, the RD in CRP levels was 52% higher (p = 0.003) for more acculturated Hispanics. Other significant predictors of CRP in Hispanics included a higher body mass index (RD 139% higher per 5 kg/m(2)), female gender (RD 36% higher), education level (RD 19% higher levels for at least a high school education, p <0.001), being insured (RD 27% higher CRP level, p = 0.006), having hypertension (RD 40% higher CRP levels, p <0.001), and statin use (RD 22% lower CRP levels, p = 0.002). In conclusion, higher acculturation was associated with increased CRP levels in Hispanics in a nationally representative population survey.

In addition, the investigators examined intraindividual variation in atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy human subjects in a crossover study design. Areas under the plasma concentration-time curve of atorvastatin and simvastatin acid were significantly related (Spearman r = 0.68; P = .035), whereas rosuvastatin profile was not related to atorvastatin or simvastatin exposure.

All adult members of the WellMed Medical Management, Inc. managed care health plan diagnosed with IHD or CHF, and continuously enrolled between July 1, 2006 and June 30, 2008, were included in the study. Cases were defined as those who had at least 1 comprehensive lipid test (the VAP [vertical auto profile] ultracentrifuge test) during this period (n=1767); they were compared to those who had no lipid testing or traditional standard lipid testing only (controls, n=289). Univariate statistics were analyzed to describe the groups, and bivariate t tests or chi-squares examined differences between the 2 cohorts. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to control for potential confounders.

Statins are also thought to have additional anti-atherogenic properties, yet defining these non-conventional modes of statin action remains incomplete. We have previously developed a novel mouse transplant model of atherosclerosis regression in which aortic segments from diseased donors are placed into normolipidemic recipients. With this model, we demonstrated the rapid loss of CD68+ cells (mainly macrophages) in plaques through the induction of a chemokine receptor CCR7-dependent emigration process. Because the human and mouse CCR7 promoter contain Sterol Response Elements (SREs), we hypothesized that Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SREBPs) are involved in increasing CCR7 expression and through this mechanism, statins would promote CD68+ cell emigration from plaques. We examined whether statin activation of the SREBP pathway in vivo would induce CCR7 expression and promote macrophage emigration from plaques. We found that western diet-fed apoE(-/-) mice treated with either atorvastatin or rosuvastatin led to a substantial reduction in the CD68+ cell content in the plaques despite continued hyperlipidemia. We also observed a significant increase in CCR7 mRNA in CD68+ cells from both the atorvastatin and rosuvastatin treated mice associated with emigration of CD68+ cells from plaques. Importantly, CCR7(-/-)/apoE(-/-) double knockout mice failed to display a reduction in CD68+ cell content upon statin treatment. Statins also affected the recruitment of transcriptional regulatory proteins and the organization of the chromatin at the CCR7 promoter to increase the transcriptional activity. Statins promote the beneficial remodeling of plaques in diseased mouse arteries through the stimulation of the CCR7 emigration pathway in macrophages.

Statins have been reputed to increase bone strength and bone density. In this study, we evaluated the effect of atorvastatin calcium on the flexural properties (3-point bending strength and modulus) of corticosteroid (methylprednisolone acetate) treated rabbit femurs and tibias. Our study hypothesis was that the use of statins would counteract the loss of bone strength caused by corticosteroid treatment. The 40 rabbits were divided into 5 groups: control, corticosteroid alone and corticosteroid combined with oral doses of atorvastatin calcium (2, 10, or 20 mg/day). A daily oral dose of atorvastatin calcium treatment for 70 days weakened the long bones of methylprednisolone acetate treated rabbits irrespective of the dosage (2, 10, or 20 mg). Cortical bone strength was assessed using the 3-point bending test at the end of the study period. A daily oral dose of atorvastatin calcium did not attenuate the loss of cortical bone strength caused by corticosteroid treatment in rabbits. It appeared to decrease that bone strength. If these results hold true in humans, they would have wide applicability given the frequent combined use of corticosteroids and statins in many patients.",

In Experiment 1, lung tumors were induced by vinyl carbamate in strain A/J mice followed by 500 mg/kg SAHA, 60 or 180 mg/kg atorvastatin, and combinations containing SAHA and atorvastatin administered in their diet. SAHA and both combinations, but not atorvastatin, decreased the multiplicity of lung tumors, including large adenomas and adenocarcinomas with the combinations demonstrating the greatest efficacy. In Experiment 2, lung tumors were induced by 4-(methylnitrosoamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol in strain A/J mice followed by 180 mg/kg atorvastatin, 500 mg/kg SAHA, or both drugs administered in the diet. SAHA and the combination of both drugs, but not atorvastatin alone, decreased the multiplicity of lung tumors and large tumors, with the combination demonstrating greater efficacy. In Experiment 3, lung tumors were induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in Swiss-Webster mice followed by 160 mg/kg atorvastatin, 400 mg/kg SAHA, or a combination of both drugs administered in the diet. SAHA and the combination, but not atorvastatin, decreased the multiplicity of lung tumors with the combination demonstrating greater efficacy. The multiplicity of colon tumors was decreased by SAHA, atorvastatin, and the combination, without any significant difference in their efficacy. mRNA expression analysis of lung tumor bearing mice suggested that the enhanced chemopreventive activity of the combination is related to atorvastatin modulation of DNA repair, SAHA modulation of angiogenesis, and both drugs modulating invasion and metastasis pathways. Atorvastatin demonstrated chemoprevention activity as indicated by the enhancement of the efficacy of SAHA to prevent mouse lung tumors.",

    "73": "In their natural environment, plants are synchronously confronted with mutualists and antagonists, and thus benefit from signals that contain messages for both functional groups of interaction partners. Floral scents are complex blends of volatiles of different chemical classes, including benzenoids and terpenoids. It has been hypothesized that benzenoids have evolved as pollinator attracting signals, while monoterpenoids serve as defensive compounds against antagonists. In order to test this hypothesis, we reduced terpene emission in flowers of Phlox paniculata with specific biosynthetic inhibitors and compared the responses of Lasius niger ants to natural and inhibited floral scent bouquets. While the natural odors were strongly repellent to ants, the bouquets with a reduced emission rate of terpenoids were not. The loss of the flowers' ability to repel ants could be attributed predominantly to reduced amounts of linalool, a monoterpene alcohol. Flying flower visitors, mainly hoverflies, did not discriminate between the two types of flowers in an outdoor experiment. Since individual compounds appear to be capable of either attracting pollinators or defending the flower from enemies, the complexity of floral scent bouquets may have evolved to allow flowers to respond to both mutualists and antagonists simultaneously.",

In the present study, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on ApoM expression and the underlying mechanism(s). Simvastatin up-regulated hepatic ApoM mRNA and protein expression in mice. In HepG2 cells, simvastatin significantly enhanced ApoM mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. Simvastatin increased hepatic hepatocyte nuclear factor-1\u03b1 (HNF-1\u03b1) mRNA and reduced liver X receptor-\u03b1 (LXR\u03b1) mRNA expression in mice. The simvastatin-induced up-regulation of ApoM was blocked by an HNF-1\u03b1 inhibitor (UCDA) or an LXR\u03b1 agonist (TO901317) in HepG2 cells which indicates that this effect is mediated via the regulation of HNF-1\u03b1 and LXR\u03b1. In conclusion, simvastatin signi\ufb01cantly up-regulated ApoM expression in vivo and in vitro, which indicates that ApoM is another novel apolipoprotein regulated by simvastatin.

Syrian hamsters were fed an AIN-93G-based high\u2011fat diet (HFD) and were orally administered 5 or 10 mg/kg BW of oligomer (6 kDa) chitosan (OC), low\u2011molecular-weight (70 kDa) chitosan (LMC) or high\u2011molecular-weight (200 kDa) chitosan (HMC) four times per week for 12 weeks. Animals receiving 2.5 mg/kg BW lovastatin (LOVA) served as a positive control. The blood lipid profiles of these control animals revealed that all chitosans and LOVA significantly decreased total triglyceride, total cholesterol, low\u2011density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and very\u2011low\u2011density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol levels in a dose\u2011dependent manner compared to the HFD-fed controls (P<0.05). The blood lipid lowering effectiveness of the three chitosans followed the order of LMC>OC>HMC. Hamsters receiving 5 and 10 mg/kg LMC (P<0.05) exhibited an increase in fecal fat content. Immunoblot assay revealed that acyl\u2011coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase-2 (ACAT-2) expression was suppressed in all chitosan-fed animals compared to the HFD-fed controls (P<0.05). These results suggest that chitosan effectively decreases blood lipid content, and its effectiveness depends on the molecular size of chitosan.

    "76": "The present study was performed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the anti-atherogenic action of atorvastatin (ATV). We investigated the effect of ATV on intimal thickening of the rat carotid artery induced by collar placement and further examined the effect of ATV on the expression of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) I\u03b1 and PKG I\u03b2 in carotid arteries. The expression of CNP was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Western blotting was used to determine the expression of PKG I\u03b1 and PKG I\u03b2. After 14 days, the collar placement induced a marked neointima formation and a reduction in CNP and PKG I\u03b1 expression. These effects were significantly reversed by ATV treatment. However, no obvious changes in PKG I\u03b2 expression were observed throughout the study. In conclusion, the present data suggest that elevation of CNP represents an additional mechanism by which ATV treatment may prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "77": "By taking advantage of the crystallographic data of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) complexed with statins, a quantum biochemistry study based on the density functional theory is performed to estimate the interaction energy for each statin when one considers binding pockets of different sizes. Assuming a correlation between statin potency and the strength of the total HMGR-statin binding energy, clinical data as well as IC(50) values of these cholesterol-lowering drugs are successfully explained only after stabilization of the calculated total binding energy for a larger size of the ligand-interacting HGMR region, one with a radius of at least 12.0 \u212b. Actually, the binding pocket radius suggested by classic works, which was based solely on the interpretation of crystallographic data of the HMGR-statin complex, is smaller than that necessary to achieve total binding energy convergence in our simulations. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are shown to be the most strongly bound HMGR inhibitors, while simvastatin and fluvastatin are the weakest ones. A binding site, interaction energy between residues and statin atoms, and residues domain (BIRD) panel is constructed, indicating clear quantum biochemistry-based routes for the development of new statin derivatives.", 
    "78": "Modern drug discovery relies on the continual development of synthetic methodology to address the many challenges associated with the design of new pharmaceutical agents. One such challenge arises from the enzymatic metabolism of drugs in vivo by cytochrome P450 oxidases, which use single-electron oxidative mechanisms to rapidly modify small molecules to facilitate their excretion. A commonly used synthetic strategy to protect against in vivo metabolism involves the incorporation of electron-withdrawing functionality, such as the trifluoromethyl (CF(3)) group, into drug candidates. The CF(3) group enjoys a privileged role in the realm of medicinal chemistry because its incorporation into small molecules often enhances efficacy by promoting electrostatic interactions with targets, improving cellular membrane permeability, and increasing robustness towards oxidative metabolism of the drug. Although common pharmacophores often bear CF(3) motifs in an aromatic system, access to such analogues typically requires the incorporation of the CF(3) group, or a surrogate moiety, at the start of a multi-step synthetic sequence. Here we report a mild, operationally simple strategy for the direct trifluoromethylation of unactivated arenes and heteroarenes through a radical-mediated mechanism using commercial photocatalysts and a household light bulb. We demonstrate the broad utility of this transformation through addition of CF(3) to a number of heteroaromatic and aromatic systems. The benefit to medicinal chemistry and applicability to late-stage drug development is also shown through examples of the direct trifluoromethylation of widely prescribed pharmaceutical agents.",

FCR of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoB of ARH was significantly lower than those of control subjects (0.109 versus 0.450\u00b10.122 1/day). In contrast, the direct removal of very-low-density lipoprotein remnant was significantly greater in ARH than those in control subjects (47.5 versus 2\u00b12%). Interestingly, FCR of LDL apoB in ARH dramatically increased to 0.464 1/day, accompanying reduction of LDL cholesterol levels from 8.63 to 4.22 mmol/L after treatment with atorvastatin of 20 mg/d for 3 months.",

Inflammation plays a pivotal role in the progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, little is known about how dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced systemic inflammation impacts overall heart health and, correspondingly, how soy protein modulates risk of CVD development in DSS-induced systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that soy protein-fed rats would have a lower risk of CVD by beneficial alteration of gene expression involving lipid metabolism and antioxidant capacity in DSS-induced systemic inflammation. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: casein, casein + DSS, soy protein, and soy protein + DSS. After 26 days, inflammation was induced in one group from each diet by incorporating 3% DSS in drinking water for 48 hours. Soy protein-fed rats had lower final body weights (P = .010), epididymal fat weights (P = .049), total cholesterol (P < .001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .001). In regard to gene expression, soy protein-fed rats had lower sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (P = .032) and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (P = .028) levels and higher low-density lipoprotein receptor levels (P = .036). Antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase was higher among the soy protein groups (P = .037 and P = .002, respectively). These results suggest that soy protein positively influences cardiovascular health by regulating serum lipids through modified expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 and its downstream genes (ie, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and low-density lipoprotein receptor) and by promoting the antioxidant enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase.",

However, no effective strategies against VEGF expression have been available in NSCLCs therapy. This study demonstrated that elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels derived from both mitochondria and NADPH oxidase were required for VEGF expression in NSCLC cells. Atorvastatin administration could significantly inhibit VEGF expression both in vitro and in vivo via inhibition of ROS production. Atorvastatin inhibited ROS generation partly through suppression of Rac1/NADPH oxidase activity. Specifically, atorvastatin could upregulate the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase, which are responsible for elimination of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. Thus, inhibition of ROS production by concomitant suppression of Rac1/NADPH oxidase activity and upregulation of the activity of GPx and catalase contributes critically to atorvastatin-reduced VEGF expression in NSCLCs. Atorvastatin may be a potential alternative against VEGF expression and angiogenesis in NSCLCs therapy.", 
    "112": "Perhaps no recent trial in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease has resulted in more controversy than the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, which was first published in 2008.

The trial showed that rosuvastatin is a powerful statin that, at lower doses, can reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to levels previously not seen with other agents. Concurrently, it can also reduce high-sensitivity C-reactive protein to levels below what are considered normal, but that might be more physiologic. In the trial participants who achieved such lowering, major cardiovascular events, including venous thromboembolic events, were reduced even in the short term. Despite these results, many still question whether the trial results should influence high-sensitivity C-reactive protein testing or the prescription of statins for individuals at low risk for cardiovascular disease.",

    "119": "Although clinical trials provide useful information on drug safety and efficacy, results do not always reflect those observed in the real world. The Japanese long-term prospective post-marketing surveillance LIVALO Effectiveness and Safety (LIVES) Study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of pitavastatin in clinical practice in ~20,000 patients. After 104 weeks, pitavastatin was associated with significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (29.1%) that largely occurred within 4 weeks of treatment initiation. In patients with abnormal triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels at baseline, pitavastatin reduced TG and increased HDL-C by 22.7% and 19.9%, respectively. Overall, 88.2% of the primary prevention low-risk patients attained their Japan Atherosclerosis Society LDL-C target, compared with 82.7% of intermediate-risk patients, 66.5% of high-risk patients and 50.3% of secondary prevention patients. Only 10.4% of pitavastatin-treated patients experienced adverse events (AEs), of which approximately 84% were mild and around 1% was severe. Increases in blood creatine phosphokinase (2.7%), alanine aminotransferase (1.8%), myalgia (1.1%), aspartate aminotransferase (1.5%) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (1.0%) were the most common AEs and only 7.4% of patients discontinued pitavastatin due to AEs. Regression analysis demonstrated that age was not a significant factor for the incidence of any AE or myopathy-associated events. A subanalysis of initial LIVES data focussing on the effects of pitavastatin on HDL-C levels showed that HDL-C was elevated by 5.9% in all patients and by 24.6% in those with low (<l mmol/L; 40 mg/dL) HDL-C levels at baseline (P < 0.0001). A time-course analysis showed that the elevation in HDL-C in the low-HDL-C group was enhanced by 14.0% and 24.9% at 12 weeks and 104 weeks, respectively. In contrast, previous studies have shown that other statins have inconsistent effects on HDL-C levels, with elevations ranging from 0% to 12%. According to a LIVES subanalysis, pitavastatin produced a significant increase in HDL-C levels in patients switching from other statins, suggesting that patients with an unacceptably low level of HDL-C might benefit from switching to pitavastatin. Further analyses showed an improvement in HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes after long-term pitavastatin treatment and a significant increase in eGRF in patients with chronic kidney disease. Results from the 5-year LIVES extension study (N = 6,582) showed that long-term treatment with pitavastatin was well tolerated and that the reduction in LDL-C achieved after 104 weeks was maintained for the duration of treatment, whereas levels of HDL-C continued to rise. Importantly, multivariate analysis of the 5-year data showed that, in addition to advanced age (\u2265 65 years), male gender, hypertension, diabetes, and a history of ischemic heart disease, on-treatment levels of HDL-C and LDL-C were significant predictors for cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular risk. In this study, the greatest reduction in CV and cerebrovascular risk was achieved by patients achieving both their LDL-C and HDL-C targets. Overall, results from the LIVES study show that pitavastatin is well tolerated and effectively modifies atherogenic lipid profiles, thereby reducing CV and cerebrovascular risk in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia. Pitavastatin's ability to significantly and continually increase HDL-C levels over time suggests a particular benefit for patients with low baseline levels of HDL-C and/or those that fail to increase their HDL-C levels using alternative statins.", 
    "120": "Atherogenic dyslipidemia is characterised by high levels of triglycerides, low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and moderate to marked elevations in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations; such dyslipidemia is further characterised by high apolipoprotein B (apoB): apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) ratios. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that statins are effective in lowering LDL-C and reducing cardiovascular (CV) risk in people with dyslipidemia. However, the most effective treatments should target all of the key atherogenic features, rather than LDL-C alone. Pitavastatin is a new member of the statin class whose distinct pharmacological features translate into a broad spectrum of action on both apoB-containing and apoA1-containing lipoprotein components of the atherogenic lipid profile. The efficacy and safety of this statin has been demonstrated by a large clinical development programme conducted both in Japanese and Caucasian populations. Phase III and IV studies in a wide range of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or combined dyslipidemia showed that 12 weeks' treatment with pitavastatin l-4 mg was well tolerated, significantly improved lipid profiles (including LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C levels) and increased the EAS-/NCEP ATP Ill-recommended LDL-C target attainment rate to a similar or greater degree as comparable doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin. Results were similar across all patient groups and were generally sustained after 52 weeks of treatment. However, whereas the effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin on HDL-C levels remained constant over the long term, pitavastatin-treated patients experienced progressive and maintained elevations in HDL-C, ultimately increasing by up to 14.3% vs. initial baseline. In this context, it is significant that the in vitro studies of Yamashita et al. [J Atheroscler Thromb 2010;17:436-51] have shown pitavastatin to be distinguished by its potent stimulation of apoA1 production in hepatocyte-like cells. These findings suggest that pitavastatin may be highly efficacious in raising levels of lipid-poor apoA1 particles, which are known to be highly active in ABCA1-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux, an observation which is pertinent to the excessive accumulation of cholesterol in macrophage foam cells of the atherosclerotic plaque. Indeed, the intravascular remodelling and maturation of lipid-poor apoA1 particles is known to drive flux of apoA1, cholesterol and phospholipid through the HDL pathway. It is equally relevant that pitavastatin therapy has been shown to be efficacious in markedly reducing coronary atheroma volume in acute coronary syndrome patients in the JAPAN-ACS trial, a therapeutic effect which may be linked to its impact on apoA1/HDL metabolism and function. Overall, Phase III and IV studies demonstrate that pitavastatin 1-4 mg is well tolerated, attenuates the atherogenic lipid profile and increases LDL-C target attainment rates with a similar or greater efficacy to comparable doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. Furthermore, pitavastatin may be particularly beneficial in high-risk patients with elevated concentrations of TG-rich lipoproteins and low levels of HDL-C, and in whom the atheroprotective function of HDL particles is typically defective; significantly, such patients typically exhibit persistent, residual cardiometabolic risk even when LDL-C is at goal. In this context, it is relevant that such patient groups cover a wide spectrum of metabolic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, coronary disease, familial and non-familial forms of hypercholesterolemia, auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, renal disease and some forms of hepatic insufficiency.", 
    "121": "Compared to other statins, pitavastatin is a highly potent 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor and an efficient hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) receptor inducer. Its characteristic structure (heptenoate as the basic structure, a core quinoline ring and side chains that include fluorophenyl and cyclopropyl moieties) provides improved pharmacokinetics and significant LDL-C-lowering efficacy at low doses. Unlike other statins, the cyclopropyl group on the pitavastatin molecule appears to divert the drug away from metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3 A4 and allows only a small degree of clinically insignificant metabolism by CYP2C9. As a result, pitavastatin is minimally metabolized; most of the bioavailable fraction of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the bile and is reabsorbed by the small intestine ready for enterohepatic recirculation. This process probably accounts for pitavastatin's increased bioavailability relative to most other statins and contributes to its prolonged duration of action. In addition to its potent LDL-C-lowering efficacy, a number of pleiotropic benefits that might lead to a reduction in residual risk have been suggested in vitro. These include beneficial effects on endothelial function, stabilisation of the coronary plaque, anti-inflammatory effects and anti-oxidation. With regard to the clinical safety and efficacy of pitavastatin, the Phase IV Collaborative study of Hypercholesterolemia drug Intervention and their Benefits for Atherosclerosis prevention (CHIBA study) showed similar changes in lipid profile with pitavastatin and atorvastatin in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, a subgroup analysis of the CHIBA study showed that pitavastatin produced more significant changes from baseline in LDL-C, TG, and HDL-C in patients with hypercholesterolemia and metabolic syndrome. The clinical usefulness of pitavastatin has been further demonstrated in a number of Japanese patient groups with hypercholesterolemia, including those with insulin resistance, low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), high levels of C-reactive protein, and chronic kidney disease. Finally, the Japan Assessment of Pitavastatin and AtorvastatiN in Acute Coronary Syndrome (JAPAN-ACS) study showed that pitavastatin induces plaque regression in patients with ACS, which suggests potential benefits for pitavastatin in reducing CV risk.", 
    "122": "Evidence that low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) causes cardiovascular disease (CVD) is overwhelming. It has also been proven beyond all doubt that lowering the level of LDL-C using statins reduces CV risk. However, many people remain at high risk even when their level of LDL-C has been reduced by aggressive treatment with statins. One reason for this residual risk can be a low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). The concentration of HDL-C is an independent, inverse predictor for CVD. This relationship is apparent even when treatment with statins has reduced the level of LDL-C to below 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). It has therefore been suggested that raising the level of HDL-C should be considered as a therapeutic strategy for reducing the residual CV risk that persists in some people, despite aggressive LDL-C lowering with statins. HDL particles have several functions with the potential to protect against arterial disease, the best known of which relates to their ability to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages in the artery wall. However, HDLs have several additional protective properties that are independent of their involvement in cholesterol metabolism. For example, they have properties that reduce oxidation, vascular inflammation and thrombosis, improve endothelial function, promote endothelial repair, enhance insulin sensitivity and promote insulin secretion by pancreatic beta islet cells. There is also a large and compelling body of evidence in animal models showing that interventions that increase HDL levels are profoundly anti-atherogenic. Major causes of low HDL are abdominal obesity and type 2 diabetes, the worldwide incidences of which are increasing at alarming rates. Strategies to increase the concentration of HDL should begin with lifestyle changes such as weight reduction, increased physical activity and smoking cessation. However, compliance with such measures is frequently poor and pharmacological intervention may be required. Currently available HDL-raising medications include fibrates, niacin and statins. There is indisputable evidence that lowering LDL-C levels using statins translates into a large reduction in CV risk. There is also mounting evidence that increasing the level of HDL-C using statins contributes to an additional reduction in CV risk. For example, the increase in HDL-C levels that was associated with simvastatin treatment in the 4S study was a significant predictor for the reduction in CV events. Moreover, a meta-analysis of 1,455 patients in 4 coronary intravascular ultrasound imaging trials showed that both the achieved level of LDL-C and the increase in HDL-C concentration during statin treatment were significant independent predictors for coronary atheroma progression as assessed by coronary intravascular ultrasound. In conclusion, evidence suggests that low levels of HDL-C are associated with an increased CV risk even when LDL-C is reduced to below 1.7 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) with a statin. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that increasing the level of HDL-C has the capacity to reduce CV risk. Thus, there is a compelling case for targeting both the LDL and HDL fractions to reduce CV risk in people with dyslipidemia, high CV risk and low levels of HDL-C.",

    "140": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal co-dominant disorder characterized by a marked elevation of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration, which in turn is associated with a greatly increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. International consensus recommends the use of statins as the first line of treatment for patients with this condition. However, homozygote FH patients with persistently elevated LDL-C levels are usually resistant to multiple-drug therapy. Fortunately, LDL apheresis (or simply 'lipoprotein apheresis') provides a treatment option for patients who are refractory or intolerant to lipid-lowering medications, or if there is progressive cardiovascular disease despite maximal drug therapy. Lipoprotein apheresis is an extracorporeal LDL-C-lowering treatment similar in concept to renal dialysis. There are now five main methods for extracorporeal lipoprotein apheresis in use, namely dextran sulfate adsorption (DSA), heparin extracorporeal LDL precipitation (HELP), polyacrylate full blood adsorption (PFBA or DALI\u00ae system) using hemoperfusion, immunoadsorption, and filtration plasmapheresis. Lipoprotein apheresis has been shown to be successful in reducing LDL-C levels, as well as levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a prothrombotic proatherogenic lipoprotein. In contrast, however, lipoprotein apheresis seems to have a smaller effect in preventing atherosclerosis progression, thus suggesting that a major component of the reduction in cardiovascular events may be mediated by mitigating Lp(a) levels. Side effects are infrequent and mild, and have mainly consisted of lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. As these are often bradykinin-mediated and associated with concomitant ACE inhibitor use, angiotensin type 2 receptor antagonists should be used instead of ACE inhibitors with DALI and PFBA. Nevertheless, there is scope for wider application of lipoprotein apheresis. The high cost and invasive nature of lipoprotein apheresis limits uptake; however, it is an important treatment modality that should be considered in carefully selected patients. National and international registries compiling outcome data for lipoprotein apheresis need to be established to help expand the evidence base regarding its effectiveness.",

Fluvastatin-induced fatal rhabdomyolysis has not been previously reported. We describe here a patient with liver cirrhosis who experienced fluvastatin-induced fatal rhabdomyolysis. This patient had been treated with simvastatin (20 mg/day) for coronary artery disease and was switched to fluvastatin (20 mg/day) 10 days before admission. He was also taking aspirin, betaxolol, candesartan, lactulose, and entecavir. Rhabdomyolysis was complicated and continued to progress. He was treated with massive hydration, urine alkalization, intravenous furosemide, and continuous renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure, but eventually died due to rhabdomyolysis complicated by hepatic failure. In conclusion, fluvastatin should be used with caution in patients with liver cirrhosis, especially with other medications metabolized with CYP2C9.",

The present study delineates the effects of statins, atorvastatin, and simvastatin on oxidative stress and functions of mitochondria that are the primary cellular sources of oxidative stress. In isolated rat liver mitochondria, both the statins prevented calcium-induced cytochrome c release, lipid peroxidation, and opening of the mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT). Both the statins decreased the activity of mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS), lowered the intramitochondrial ionized calcium, and increased the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Our findings suggest that statins lower intramitochondrial ionized calcium that decreases mtNOS activity, lowers oxidative stress, prevents MPT opening, and prevents the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. These results provide a novel framework for understanding the antioxidative properties of statins and their effects on mitochondrial functions.",

(2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 14734-14743) that simvastatin treatment of endothelial cells leads to a marked decrease in PKA-modulated phosphorylation of the protein VASP. Here we show that long-term treatment of mice with simvastatin attenuates the vasorelaxation response to the \u03b2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, without affecting endothelin-induced vasoconstriction or carbachol-induced vasorelaxation. We found that statin treatment of endothelial cells dose-dependently inhibits PKA activation as assessed by analyses of serine 157 VASP phosphorylation as well as Epac-mediated Rap1 activation. These effects of simvastatin are completely reversed by mevalonate and by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, implicating geranylgeranylation as a critical determinant of the stain response. We used biochemical approaches as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) methods with a cAMP biosensor to show that simvastatin treatment of endothelial cells markedly inhibits cAMP accumulation in response to epinephrine. Importantly, simvastatin treatment significantly decreases G\u03b1(s) abundance, without affecting other G\u03b1 subunits. Simvastatin treatment does not influence G\u03b1(s) protein stability, and paradoxically increases the abundance of G\u03b1(s) mRNA. Finally, we found that simvastatin treatment inhibits G\u03b1(s) translation mediated by Akt/mTOR/eIF4/4EBP. Taken together, these findings establish a novel mechanism by which simvastatin modulates \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in vascular wall, and may have implications for cardiovascular therapeutics.",

In carriers of 1 or 2 minor alleles, the HR was 0.85 (0.66-1.11) and carriers of 2 copies of the minor allele obtained a significant risk reduction (HR: 0.44, 95% confidence interval, 0.23-0.84). In IDEAL, the respective HRs were 0.85 (0.67-1.10), 0.88 (0.62-1.07) and 0.91 (0.58-1.43). The interaction term for carrier status by treatment was also nonsignificant (P=0.810 in TNT and P=0.909 in IDEAL).", 
    "189": "In these 2 large, randomized clinical trials, carriers of the KIF6 719Arg allele were not at increased cardiovascular risk and did not obtain consistent cardiovascular benefit from high-dose statin therapy compared with noncarriers.", 
    "190": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic lipid disorder that is characterized by severely elevated cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease. Both the heterozygous and homozygous forms of FH require aggressive cholesterol-lowering therapy. Statins alone frequently do not lower these patients' cholesterol to therapeutic levels, and some patients are intolerant to statins. Combination or monotherapy with other current pharmacotherapies are options, but even with these some FH patients do not meet their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals. In the cases of statin intolerance, LDL apheresis may be another treatment option. There are currently several novel therapies in development for LDL lowering that target either production or catabolism of LDL, plaque regression, and potentially gene transfer. We conclude that there is a need beyond statins for patients with FH, especially in cases of statin intolerance, and when even the highest doses of statin do not get patients to goal cholesterol levels.", 
    "191": "The statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) have been proven to be effective in lowering cholesterol and as anti-lipid agents against cardiovascular disease. Recent reports demonstrate an anticancer effect induced by the statins through inhibition of cell proliferation. Probably, these effects are due to suppression of the mevalonate pathway leading to the depletion of various downstream products that play an essential role in cell cycle progression, cell signaling and membrane integrity. To date, although many hypotheses have been proposed, the exact mechanism at the basis of cancer cell growth arrest induced by statins is not known. In this study, we have demonstrated that simvastatin, at a dose of 20 \u00b5M for 24-72 h, induced in cancer cells but not in normal cells precise features of apoptosis including increased DNA fragmentation while, at the molecular level simvastatin induced overexpression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax together with an inhibition of BCL-2, the gene that has the well-known function of protecting cells from apoptosis. The simvastatin-mediated induction of apoptosis in similar cancer cells but not in normal cells is very interesting and may be at the basis of cancer therapy using statins, usually in combination with chemotherapy or to be used as a cancer protective drug. Simvastatin may, thus, play a dual prophylactic role as a lipid-lowering drug for the prevention of heart disease and as an anticancer agent to prevent certain types of cancers.", 
    "192": "Aliskiren is the first commercially available, orally active, direct renin inhibitor approved to treat hypertension. The renin-angiotensin system has been shown to be a significant contributor to the development of hypercholesterolemia-induced atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiatherosclerotic and plaque stabilization effects of aliskiren alone and in combination with atorvastatin.", 
    "193": "APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice (n\u200a=\u200a14-17/group) were fed a western-type diet (containing 0.25% cholesterol) alone or were treated with either aliskiren (15\u200amg/kg per day), atorvastatin (3.6\u200amg/kg per day) or a combination of aliskiren and atorvastatin. Effects on SBP, total cholesterol, inflammation markers and atherosclerotic size and composition were assessed.", 
    "194": "Aliskiren reduced SBP (-19%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and atorvastatin reduced total cholesterol (-24%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Atherosclerotic lesion area was reduced by aliskiren (-40%, P\u200a<\u200a0.01), atorvastatin (-61%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and the combination treatment (-69%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). Aliskiren alone and together with atorvastatin decreased the number of T cells in the aortic root area (-60%, P\u200a<\u200a0.01; -41%, P\u200a<\u200a0.05), as well as macrophage (-64%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001; -72%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and necrotic area (-52%, P\u200a=\u200a0.071; -84%, P\u200a<\u200a0.001) in the lesion. Atorvastatin alone and together with aliskiren decreased monocyte adherence (-43%, P\u200a<\u200a0.05 and -51%, P\u200a<\u200a0.01) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (both -36%, P\u200a<\u200a0.01). The combination treatment decreased the number of lesions (-17%, P\u200a<\u200a0.05) and E-selectin (-17%, P\u200a<\u200a0.05).", 
    "195": "Aliskiren inhibited atherosclerosis development and improved plaque stability alone and in combination with atorvastatin, possibly via a mechanism involving T cells. These results suggest a potential benefit of using aliskiren in a clinical setting, particularly in combination with statin treatment.", 
    "196": "The increasing use of proliferation signal inhibitors (PSIs) has raised the issue of their risk profile. We sought to determine the causes, incidence, risk factors, and consequences of withdrawal due to adverse events of PSIs in maintenance heart transplantation.", 
    "197": "This was a retrospective study from 9 centers of the Spanish Registry for Heart Transplantation. Demographic, clinical, analytic, and evolution data were obtained for patients in whom a PSI (sirolimus or everolimus) was used between October 2001 and March 2009.", 
    "198": "In the first year, 16% of 548 patients could not tolerate PSIs. This incidence rate stabilized to 3% to 4% per year thereafter. The most frequent causes for discontinuation were edema (4.7%), gastrointestinal toxicity (3.8%), pneumonitis (3.3%), and hematologic toxicity (2.0%). In multivariate analysis, withdrawal of PSI was related to the absence of statin therapy (p = 0.006), concomitant treatment with anti-metabolites (p = 0.006), a poor baseline renal function (p = 0.026), and multiple indications for PSI use (p = 0.04). Drug discontinuation was associated with a decline in renal function (p = 0.045) but not with an excess in mortality (p = 0.42).", 
    "199": "In this large cohort of maintenance heart transplant recipients taking a PSI, 16% withdrew treatment in the first year, and 25% had stopped PSI due to severe adverse events by the fourth year. This high rate of toxicity-related PSI withdrawal could limit the clinical utility of this otherwise novel class of immunosuppressive agents.", 
    "200": "Epidemiological studies have shown that long-term treatment with statins decreases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Statins have pleiotropic effects by lowering the concentration of isoprenoid intermediates. Although several studies have shown that statins may reduce amyloid beta protein levels, there have been few reports on the interaction between statins and tau. We report here that pitavastatin reduces total and phosphorylated tau levels in a cellular model of tauopathy, and in primary neuronal cultures. The decrease caused by pitavastatin is reversed by the addition of mevalonate, or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. The maturation of small G proteins, including RhoA was disrupted by pitavastatin, as was the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), a major tau kinase. Toxin A, inhibitor of glycosylation of small G proteins, and Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor decreased phosphorylated tau levels. Rho kinase inhibitor also inactivated glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2. Although the mechanisms responsible for the reduction in tau protein by pitavastatin require further examination, this report sheds light on possible therapeutic approaches to tauopathy.", 
    "201": "Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the key enzyme of the sterol biosynthesis pathway. Statin therapy is commonly regarded as well tolerated. However, serious adverse effects have also been reported, especially during high-dose statin therapy. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of statins on gene expression profiles in human hepatoma HepG2 cells using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Expression of 102, 857 and 1091 genes was changed substantially in HepG2 cells treated with simvastatin, fluvastatin and atorvastatin, respectively. Pathway and gene ontology analysis showed that many of the genes with changed expression levels were involved in a broad range of metabolic processes. The presented data clearly indicate substantial differences between the tested statins."
