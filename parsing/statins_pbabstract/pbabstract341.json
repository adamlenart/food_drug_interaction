Diabetic women, for example, are exquisitely sensitive to the development of atherosclerosis. There is no clinical trial devoted to the study of cholesterol lowering in women. A meta-analysis of recent statin trials with clinical endpoints, however, demonstrates that cholesterol lowering is as beneficial in women as it is in men. Hormone replacement therapy has not been demonstrated in a clinical trial to be of benefit, even though there is considerable observational, epidemiology and basic science evidence that indicates that it might be. It is important that the risk of coronary disease and stroke, particularly in older women, be recognized. Patients at risk should receive cholesterol-lowering treatment with statin drugs to prevent both atherosclerotic morbidity and mortality.", 
    "1": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are greatly contributed to the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and constitute an important part of comprehensive strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in the 21st century. Particularly, a strategy for preventing acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the most important complication of hyperlipidemia, is urgently needed. Recent research has revealed a new mechanism of prevention of coronary heart disease by statins: they not only lowered cholesterol level as previously reported, but also contribute directly to plaque stabilization. Among many statins recently marketed, some act directly onto the blood vessel wall to stabilize plaques already formed (so-called vascular statins), while statins are originally classified as chemical or non-chemical. At the same time, reports on pleiotropic activities of statins, including improvement of osteoporosis, have accumulated to suggest an extended role of statins, not merely as a hypolipidemic agent but also possibly an anti-arteriosclerotic/anti-aging drug. This article reviews the direct action of statins on the blood vessel wall, with reference to classification of statins based on difference in action on the blood vessel wall (hepatic statins vs. vascular statins).", 
    "2": "Using the whole-cell voltage-clamp method, we investigated the effect of fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, on lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced nonselective cation current (I(NSC)) in guinea pig cardiac ventricular myocytes. External LPC (3 to approximately 50 microM) induced I(NSC) in a dose-dependent manner with a lag. With fluvastatin (5 microM) in the external solution, LPC induced I(NSC), which was significantly smaller and with a longer lag compared with that in the absence of fluvastatin. With mevalonic acid (MVA) (100 microM) in the external solution, fluvastatin did not diminish LPC-induced I(NSC). Geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, an MVA metabolite, in the pipette solution prevented fluvastatin from diminishing LPC-induced I(NSC), suggesting that isoprenylated signaling molecules, such as the small G-protein Rho, might be involved in the LPC effect. Botulinum toxin C3, Rho-kinase inhibitor (R)-(+)-trans-N-(4-pyridyl)-4-(1-aminoethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide, 2 HCl (Y-27632), or pertussis toxin in the pipette solution suppressed LPC-induced I(NSC). We conclude that LPC induces I(NSC) via a Gi/Go-coupled receptor and Rho-mediated pathway. The inhibitory effect of fluvastatin on LPC-induced I(NSC) provides a new insight into the signal transduction mechanism and may have important clinical implications.",

Efficacy of preservation fluids hence reduction of ischaemia injury may become enhanced by such additives as ion channel blockers, enzyme inhibitors, haeme oxygenase modulators, endothelin-l-inhibitors, quenchers of free radicals and anti-apoptotic agents.

    "16": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, are effective lipid lowering agents, extensively used in medical practice. Statins have never been shown to be involved in the immune response, although few clinical reports have suggested a better outcome of cardiac transplantation in patients under pravastatin therapy. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules are directly involved in the activation of T lymphocytes and in the control of the immune response. Whereas only a limited number of specialized cell types express MHC-II constitutively, numerous other cells become MHC-II positive upon induction by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). We and others recently demonstrated that statins act as direct inhibitors of induction of MHC-II expression by IFN-gamma and thus as repressors of MHC-II-mediated T cell activation. This effect was observed in several cell types, including primary human endothelial cells and macrophages. Interestingly, this inhibition is specific for inducible MHC-II expression and does not concern either constitutive expression of MHC-II or expression of MHC-I. In repressing induction of MHC-II, and subsequent T lymphocyte activation, statins therefore behave as a novel type of immunomodulator. This unexpected effect provides a scientific rationale for suggesting the use of statins as novel immunosuppressors, not only in organ transplantation but in numerous other pathologies as well.",

Plaque rupture on the culprit lesion was found in 9 patients (37.5%). At least 1 plaque rupture was found somewhere other than on the culprit lesion in 19 patients (79%). These lesions were in a different artery than the culprit artery in 70.8% and were in both other arteries in 12.5% of these 24 patients. Complete IVUS examination of all 3 coronary axes in patients who had experienced a first ACS revealed that multiple atherosclerotic plaque ruptures were detected by IVUS; these multiple ruptures were present simultaneously with the culprit lesion; they were frequent and located (in three quarters of cases) on the 3 principal coronary trunks; and the multiple plaque ruptures in locations other than on the culprit lesion were less severe, nonstenosing, and less calcified.",

Mean total cholesterol (10.55+/-2.17 mmol/L), mean LDL cholesterol (8.40+/-2.13 mmol/L), and median RLP-C (0.47 mmol/L) levels were all severely elevated at baseline. After treatment, RLP-C levels were reduced by 49% (0.24 mmol/L; P<0.0001).

Release of L1210 cells from lovastatin inhibition failed to produce synchronized divisions. Moreover, contrary to earlier proposals, lovastatin did not arrest cells with a G1-phase amount of DNA.

    "24": "Cloning of genes encoding polyketide synthases (PKSs) has allowed us to identify a gene cluster for ML-236B biosynthesis in Penicillium citrinum. Like lovastatin, which is produced by Aspergillus terreus, ML-236B (compactin) inhibits the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Genomic sequencing and Northern analysis showed that nine predicted genes for ML-236B biosynthesis were located within a 38-kb region and were transcribed when ML-236B was produced. The predicted amino acid sequences encoded by these nine genes, designated mlcA- mlcH and mlcR, were similar to those encoded by the genes for lovastatin synthesis, and were therefore assumed to be involved either directly or indirectly in ML-236B biosynthesis. Targeted disruption experiments provided evidence that two PKS genes in the cluster, mlcA and mlcB, are required for the biosynthesis of the nonaketide and the diketide moieties, respectively, of ML-236B, suggesting that the gene cluster as a whole is responsible for ML-236B biosynthesis in P. citrinum. Bioconversion of some of the predicted intermediates by an mlcA-disrupted mutant was also investigated in order to analyze the ML-236B biosynthetic pathway. The molecular organization of the gene cluster and proposed functions for the ML-236B biosynthetic genes in P. citrinum are described.",

Eight patients (aged 10.8-30.1 years) with inadequately controlled total cholesterol (TC) levels by a lipid-lowering diet (8 weeks) were treated daily for 12 weeks with atorvastatin at an initial dose of 2.5 mg. The dose was increased monthly by 2.5 mg in order to lower TC levels to less than 200 mg/dl. Serum lipoprotein profile, cyclosporin A (CsA), serum creatinine (SCr), and liver and muscle enzyme levels were measured before starting the lipid-lowering diet, at the start of treatment (baseline), and during treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) (24-h) was carried out in each patient at both baseline and the end of the follow-up. During the lipid-lowering diet, no significant changes in lipoprotein parameters were observed. Atorvastatin was tolerated well and no clinical side effects were noted during the follow-up. The final dose of atorvastatin ranged from 2.5 to 7.5 mg/day. At the end of the study, TC was reduced by 32.2% ( P<0.05), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 41.8% ( P<0.05), and apo B by 29.5% ( P<0.05). No significant changes in HDL-C, VLDL-C, apolipoprotein AI, and lipoprotein(a) were observed. SCr and CsA levels were unaffected. Overall, no significant changes in mean 24-h, daytime, and nighttime ABPM values between the first and the second recordings were observed. However, both daytime and nighttime systolic and diastolic ABPM values dropped in four patients. In conclusion, low-dose atorvastatin appears to be safe, well tolerated, and effective in the treatment of post-transplant hyperlipidemia. In addition, the capacity of atorvastatin to reduce blood pressure, whether or not related to its lipid-lowering action, deserves further investigation.",

    "34": "Atorvastatin is a drug of choice in the treatment of coronary heart disease, because this hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase inhibitor significantly decreases plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. However, little is known about the underlying molecular targets of this drug. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme with multiple functions in non-hepatic lipid metabolism, may be a potential candidate and LPL gene expression may increase in response to a treatment with atorvastatin. In order to verify this hypothesis, mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were incubated with 1 and 10 micromol/l atorvastatin for 24 and 48 h and LPL mRNA concentration was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Our data indicated that atorvastatin increased LPL mRNA concentration by a time- and dose-dependent mechanism. LPL mRNA concentration was significantly increased by 82% with 10 micromol/l atorvastatin after 48 h. LPL mRNA concentration was 28% greater (not significant) than control with 10 micromol/l atorvastatin after 24 h. No increase was obtained with 1 micromol/l atorvastatin after 24 or 48 h. The first 976 nucleotides of rat LPL promoter were transfected in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Addition of 10 micromol/l atorvastatin for 48 h resulted in a 44% increase of rat LPL promoter activity. This study demonstrates for the first time that a statin can regulate LPL gene expression transcriptionally in preadipocytes.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of phalloidin on the biliary excretion of substrates typical for various canalicular transporters in rats. Phalloidin decreased the biliary excretion of tracer amounts of taurocholate, leukotriene C(4), pravastatin, and vinblastine. Increases in bile flow and biliary bile acid excretion caused by taurocholate infusion were completely inhibited by phalloidin. These data indicate that, in addition to multidrug resistance protein 2 and P glycoprotein, the vesicular targeting of the bile salt export pump, a major canalicular bile acid transporter, is also impaired by phalloidin. The decrease of biliary excretion of glutathione may also relate to the increase in the bile acid independent canalicular bile flow in phalloidin-treated rats.", 
    "36": "Remnant lipoproteins have been reported to play a causative role in atherogenesis. We investigated the effect of remnant-like lipoprotein particles (RLPs) on monocyte-endothelial interaction and their potential regulation by atorvastatin. Monocytic U937 cells were incubated with RLPs isolated from hypertriglyceridemia subjects and their adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was examined under flow conditions. Incubation of U937 cells with 15 micro g protein/mL RLPs increased their adhesion to HUVECs activated with IL-1beta (untreated: 6.8+/-1.6 cells/HPF versus RLPs: 16.2+/-3.3 cells/HPF, P<0.05). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that incubation with RLPs increased expression levels of CD11a, CD18, and CD49d in U937 cells. Moreover, RLP-induced RhoA activation as well as FAK activation was seen in U937 cells, and RLP-induced RhoA activation seemed to be involved with PKC-dependent signaling. To explore the effect of atorvastatin on RLP-induced U937 cell adhesion to HUVECs, U937 cells were incubated with RLPs in the presence of atorvastatin. Pretreatment of U937 cells with 10 micro mol/L atorvastatin significantly decreased RLP-induced U937 cell adhesion to activated HUVECs (RLP 15.2+/-1.5 cells/HPF versus atorvastatin+RLP 10.2+/-1.0 cells/HPF; P<0.05) and decreased the enhanced integrin expression in RLP-treated U937 cells. Atorvastatin also inhibited RLP-induced RhoA activation and FAK activation in U937 cells. In summary, RLPs induced monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium by sequential activation of PKC, RhoA, FAK, and integrins, indicating a role of remnant lipoproteins in vascular inflammation during atherogenesis. Atorvastatin attenuated this enhanced monocyte adhesion to HUVECs, suggesting an antiinflammatory role for this compound.", 
    "37": "The aberrant dysregulation of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) is thought to play a role in many inflammatory disorders including cystic fibrosis (CF). The complex regulation of NOS2 expression is the subject of intense investigation, and one intriguing regulatory pathway known to influence NOS2 expression is the Rho GTPase cascade. We examined NOS2 regulation in response to inflammatory cytokines in a human alveolar epithelial cell line treated with inhibitors of different upstream and downstream components of the Rho GTPase pathway to better define potential signaling mechanisms. Statin-mediated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition increased cytokine-dependent activation of the NOS2 promoter, reversible by the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrphosphate. However, inhibition of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) with Y-27632 resulted in a decrease in NOS2 promoter activity, yet an increase in NOS2 mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggest that prenylation events influence NOS2 promoter activity independently of the Rho GTPase pathway and that Rho GTPase signaling mediated through ROCK suppresses NOS2 production downstream of promoter function at the message and protein level.",

Cerivastatin exhibited dual effects on glioblastoma cells in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed disruption of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion plaques even at nanomolar concentrations. Matrigel assay demonstrated marked inhibition of glioblastoma cell invasion. Immunoblot analysis using a phosphospecific antibody against focal adhesion kinase (FAK) showed that inhibition of migration was associated with the down-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK. Our data suggest that cerivastatin may be beneficial for combination therapy with conventional anti-cancer drugs by inhibiting the invasion of glioblastoma.",

    "44": "Oxidative stress plays an important role in diabetic vascular complications. It has been shown that an imbalance in the ratio of nitric oxide to superoxide anion due to a prevalence of the superoxide anion leads to an alteration in vascular reactivity. Under these conditions an increase in peroxynitrite (ONOO-) production, resulting from the reaction between nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2-), may be hypothesised. ONOO- is responsible for nitration of tyrosine residues in proteins; therefore the presence of nitrotyrosine (NT) in plasma proteins is considered indirect evidence of ONOO- production. NT has been found in the plasma of patients with diabetes, but it is not detectable in the plasma of healthy controls. NT plasma values are correlated with plasma glucose concentrations, and further studies exploring the effects of acute hyperglycaemia on NT formation confirmed that NT is produced both in normal subjects during hyperglycaemic clamp and in working hearts from rats during hyperglycaemic perfusion. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycaemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia and hyperglycaemia induce an endothelial dysfunction through an oxidative stress; however, the specific roles of these two factors are matters for debate. In a clinical study, high-fat load and glucose alone each produced a decrease in endothelial function and an increase in NT in normal subjects and patients with diabetes. These effects were more pronounced when high-fat load and glucose were combined. Short-term simvastatin treatment had no effect on lipid parameters, but reduced the effects of high-fat load, glucose alone, and both high-fat load and glucose on endothelial function and NT Long-term simvastatin treatment was accompanied by a smaller increase in postprandial triglycerides, which was followed by smaller variations in endothelial function and NT. This study showed an independent and cumulative effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycaemia on endothelial function, suggesting oxidative stress as a common mediator of these effects. Simvastatin shows a beneficial effect on oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which may be ascribed to a direct effect as well as the lipid-lowering action of the drug. These studies indicate that ONOO- is generated in diabetes, suggesting the possible involvement of ONOO- in the development of diabetic complications.", 
    "45": "In the present study, we evaluated the effects of combination therapy with niceritrol and pravastatin in patients with hyperlipidaemia. A total of 62 patients with hyperlipidaemia, defined as total cholesterol levels above 220 mg/dl or triglyceride levels above 150 mg/dl, were recruited. Patients were divided into two groups: Group N received initial therapy with niceritrol 750-1500 mg/day, and those in Group P, pravastatin 10 mg/day. After 8 weeks, pravastatin 10 mg/day was added to the Group N treatment regimen for a further 8 weeks, while patients in Group P were given niceritrol 750-1500 mg/day in addition to pravastatin for 8 weeks. After the 8-week combination therapy study period, total cholesterol levels were 209.6 mg/dl in Group N and 220.7 mg/dl in Group P. Decreased triglyceride and lipoprotein(a) levels and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, neither of which were achieved by pravastatin administration alone, were achieved with the combination of pravastatin and niceritrol. We conclude that when a single lipid-lowering drug fails to show therapeutic value, attempting combination therapy with a nicotinic acid preparation and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) is worthwhile.",

    "53": "Renal injury evokes tubular cholesterol accumulation, mediated in part by increased HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) levels. The present study was undertaken to define potential molecular determinants of these changes and to ascertain the relative importance of increased cholesterol production versus mevalonate pathway-driven protein prenylation, on the emergence of the so-called postrenal injury \"cytoresistant state.\" Cultured proximal tubule (HK-2) cells were subjected to Fe or ATP depletion injury, followed 1 to 24 hours later by assessments of: 1) sterol transcription factor expression (SREBP)-1 and -2); 2) HMGCR mRNA levels; and 3) Ras/Rho prenylation. HMGCR mRNA and Ras/Rho prenylation were also assessed after in vivo ischemic and Fe-mediated renal damage. Using specific inhibitors, the relative importance of protein prenylation versus terminal cholesterol synthesis on HK-2 cell susceptibility to injury was also assessed. Acute injury induced HK-2 cell SREBP disruption and reductions in HMGCR mRNA. Renal cortical HMGCR mRNA also fell in response to either in vivo ischemic or Fe-mediated oxidant damage. At 24 hours after in vitro/in vivo injury, a time of cholesterol buildup, no increase in Ras/Rho prenylation was observed. Prenylation inhibitors did not sensitize HK-2 cells to injury. Conversely, squalene synthase (terminal cholesterol synthesis) blockade sensitized HK-2 cells to both Fe and ATP depletion attack. We concluded that: 1) acute tubular cell injury can destroy SREBPs and lower HMGCR mRNA. This suggests that posttranscriptional/translational events are responsible for HMGCR enzyme and cholesterol accumulation after renal damage. 2) Injury-induced cholesterol accumulation appears dissociated from increased protein prenylation. 3) Cholesterol accumulation, per se, seems to be the dominant mechanism by which the mevalonate pathway contributes to the postrenal injury cytoresistant state.",

In the present study 304 patients referred for elective coronary angiography due to suspected CHD were included. Seventy-three of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction (MI). Twenty-four hours heart rate variability (HRV) was obtained in all the patients. In patients with a previous MI, HRV was significantly higher in patients who were treated with statins compared to patients not given statins. Matching of the patients with identical serum cholesterol levels (3.7 mmol l(-1) < or = s-cholesterol < or = 8.1 mmol l (-1)) also revealed a higher SDNN in patients who had a previous MI and were on statin treatment. Similar results were seen by matching for serum low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. In line with this, step-wise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that treatment with statins had an independent and significant impact on HRV. Our data suggest that statins may increase HRV in patients with a previous MI, which could in part explain the early beneficial effect on clinical events observed in several trials.", 
    "55": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the industrialized world. Included among the risk factors for CHD are an elevated level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and a low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The discovery of drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, constituted a major advance in the treatment of patients with elevated plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol. However, although the statins are potent LDL-lowering agents, they may not be the therapy of choice for all dyslipidemic patients. This is particularly true for subjects whose primary lipid abnormality is a low level of HDL cholesterol with or without hypertriglyceridemia, a group that includes about one half of patients with CHD. In this report, we review emerging options for the treatment of patients with lipid disorders, including inhibitors of cholesterol absorption, acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein, as well as liver X receptor agonists that up-regulate the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1.", 
    "56": "Event trials using statin therapy have shown a beneficial effect on rates of cardiovascular events. The three statins that have been used in long-term trials have shown generally similar effects on rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularizations, and mortality. Safety data appear to be comparable for lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. Long-term trials of other statins are in progress or pending. The question of how much low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be lowered may be answered by studies currently in progress.", 
    "57": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world, with hypercholesterolemia as the major risk factor. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors represent the most efficient drugsfor the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. They lower plasma cholesterol due to the inhibition of endogenous cholesterol synthesis in the liverand subsequent increased expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, resulting in an up-regulated catabolic rate for plasma LDL. The beneficial effect of statins on the incidence of CHD was clearly demonstrated in several large-scale clinical trials. Currently, five statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin) are available, and two novel compounds (pitavastatin, rosuvastatin) are undergoing clinical investigation. To point out potential mechanisms leading to increased toxicity and to compare the novel statins with the established ones, this article summarizes their pharmacological data since the prevalence of adverse events can be explained at least in part by their pharmacokinetic differences.", 
    "58": "The influence of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin was assessed on the cardiovascular alterations and production of free radicals associated with chronic angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion. Simvastatin (60 mg/kg per day PO) or placebo were given concomitantly for 10 days in Sprague-Dawley rats infused with Ang II (200 ng/kg per minute SC, osmotic pump). In addition, simvastatin or placebo was also given in vehicle-infused rats. Tail-cuff pressure and albuminuria were measured before and at the end of the treatment period. Cardiac weight, carotid structure, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS, by chemiluminescence) by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and aortic wall as well as protein and lipid oxidation products were determined at the end of the study. Ang II increased tail-cuff pressure by 56+/-12 mm Hg and simvastatin blunted the development of hypertension by approximately 70% (19+/-5 mm Hg). Increases in heart weight index and carotid cross-sectional area induced by Ang II were obliterated by simvastatin (3.18+/-0.09 versus 3.46+/-0.11 mg/g body wt and 0.125+/-0.010 versus 0.177+/-0.010 mm2, respectively). The Ang II-induced increases in leukocyte and aortic production of ROS as well as protein and lipid oxidation products were prevented by simvastatin. No effect of simvastatin was detected in non-Ang II-infused rats. These results indicate that simvastatin prevented the development of hypertension and cardiovascular hypertrophy together with inhibition of the induced angiotensin II production of ROS. Therefore, inhibition of HMG CoA reductase by statins may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular alterations through its antioxidant action in experimental Ang II-dependent hypertension.", 
    "59": "Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid and also, to some degree, statins reduces cholesterol saturation of bile. The present study aimed [1] to study the effects of combined treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid and pravastatin on hepatic cholesterol metabolism and [2] to evaluate if the addition of pravastatin to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment has beneficial effects on the lipid composition of gallbladder bile in gallstone patients.", 
    "60": "Nineteen patients with cholesterol gallstones were subjected to combined treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (500 mg bid) and pravastatin (20 mg bid) for three weeks before cholecystectomy. Eleven patients received ursodeoxycholic acid only and 20 untreated gallstone patients served as controls. Gallbladder bile was collected, and for both the patients receiving combined treatment and the controls a liver biopsy was also obtained peroperatively.", 
    "61": "The cholesterol saturation of bile averaged 59% in the patients on combined treatment, 60% in the ursodeoxycholic acid-treated patients, and 130% in the untreated controls. In the patients receiving ursodeoxycholic acid, this bile salt constituted approximately 60% of all bile salts. The patients receiving combined treatment had reduced cholesterol synthesis, as reflected by a 45% reduction in serum lathosterol. The activity and the mRNA levels of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and the mRNA levels for the low density lipoprotein-receptor were not significantly affected.", 
    "62": "Pravastatin does not further reduce the cholesterol saturation of bile in gallstone patients treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, although hepatic cholesterol synthesis is inhibited. The study supports the important concept that de novo synthesized cholesterol is not particularly important for biliary cholesterol secretion in humans.", 
    "63": "We have previously shown elevated fasting plasma concentrations of intestinal remnants, as reflected by apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 and remnant-like particle-cholesterol (RLP-C) in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). We now investigate the effect of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (simvastatin) on chylomicron remnant metabolism using the measurement of fasting apoB-48 and RLP-C in FH patients after long- and short-term simvastatin therapy and after a wash-out period. We also piloted the response of a breath test, involving the measurement of the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of an intravenously injected chylomicron remnant-like emulsion labeled with cholesteryl (13)C-oleate.", 
    "64": "Fifteen FH patients were studied after > 6 months 40 mg day(-1) simvastatin treatment (long-term), a wash-out period (4 weeks), and 4 weeks of simvastatin treatment (short-term). Apolipoprotein B-48 was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting/enhanced chemiluminescence and RLP-C by an immunoseparation assay. The FCR of the chylomicron remnant-like emulsion was determined from the appearance of (13)CO(2) in the breath and by multicompartmental mathematical modelling.", 
    "65": "Both long- and short-term treatment with simvastatin were associated with decreases in the plasma concentration of apoB-48 (P < 0.05) and RLP-C (P < 0.001), but there was no significant change in the FCR of the emulsion.", 
    "66": "We suggest that long- and short-term treatments with simvastatin have comparable effects in decreasing the plasma concentration of triglyceride-rich remnants in heterozygous FH, as measured by fasting apoB-48 and RLP-C. The mechanisms for this may involve decreased production of hepatic and possibly intestinal lipoproteins, and/or up-regulation of hepatic receptor clearance pathways, but these changes are apparently not associated with a change in remnant clearance as measured kinetically by the (13)CO(2) breath test.", 
    "67": "P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression is an independent prognostic factor for response to remission-induction chemotherapy in acute myeloblastic leukaemia, particularly in the elderly. There are several potential agents for modulating Pgp-mediated multi-drug resistance, such as cyclosporin A and PSC833, which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. An alternative therapeutic strategy is to increase the use of drugs which are unaffected by Pgp. However, in this review, we explain why this may be more difficult than it appears. Evidence from in vitro studies of primary AML blasts supports the commonly held supposition that chemoresistance may be linked to apoptosis-resistance. We have found that Pgp has a drug-independent role in the inhibition of in vitro apoptosis in AML blasts. Modulation of cytokine efflux, signalling lipids and intracellular pH have all been suggested as ways by which Pgp may affect cellular resistance to apoptosis; these are discussed in this review. For a chemosensitising agent to be successful, it may be more important for it to enhance apoptosis than to increase drug uptake.", 
    "68": "Statins appear to have beneficial effects on fibrous cap stabilisation but their effects on plaque thrombogenicity have not been reported. To evaluate the thrombogenicity of human carotid plaques before and after atorvastatin treatment, 59 patients with bilateral carotid stenosis eligible for two-step carotid endoarterectomy (CEA) were randomly assigned to atorvastatin, 20 mg/day, or placebo. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses, Tissue Factor (TF), Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI) antigens (Ag) and TF activity were determined in endoarterectomy specimens obtained at baseline and after treatment. Mean TFAg and TFPIAg levels from plaques removed at the first CEA were 55 +/- 56 and 32 +/- 26 pg/mg. After placebo, TFAg and TFPIAg content was higher in the second than the first CEA. Plaques removed at the second CEA from atorvastatin-treated patients had a lower macrophage content than plaques at the first CEA. TFAg and TFPIAg levels, and TF activity in plaques after atorvastatin treatment were lower (respectively 29, 18% and 56%) than after placebo. These findings indicate that atorvastatin reduce the inflammatory/thrombotic phenotype of carotid plaque, suggesting that these drugs may indeed have a beneficial effect on cerebrovascular events.", 
    "69": "Since hypercholesterolaemia is a chronic condition, the long-term safety of statins is important. Adverse reactions involving skeletal muscle are the most common (reported incidence 1-7%). The recent withdrawal of cerivastatin because of deaths from rhabdomyolysis, of which 25% were related to gemfibrozil-cerivastatin combination therapy, has focused attention on myotoxicity associated with statins and in particular with statin-fibrate combinations. We review the safety profiles of the individual statins, and discuss the mechanisms that may account for myotoxicity associated with statins and these agents and how these may relate to the different myotoxic potential of individual agents.", 
    "70": "The statins, particularly the first-generation agents, have been well evaluated from the perspective of safety and efficacy. Cerivastatin was associated with a 10-fold higher incidence of myotoxicity than any other statin, suggesting that there may be differences in myotoxic potential between agents. Statin-associated myotoxicity is complex, involving effects on cell membrane structure and function, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired myocyte duplication. Potential differences in myotoxicity between agents may relate to the physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of individual drugs. The aetiology of myotoxicity associated with statin-fibrate combination therapy is complex and multifactorial, with recent studies suggesting that there may be differences in myotoxic potential between individual fibrates.", 
    "71": "Recent evidence suggests that there may be differences in myotoxic potential between individual agents. Thus, the choice of hypolipidaemic therapy needs to be based not only on outcome evidence and cost-effectiveness analysis, but also on safety considerations for individual agents.", 
    "72": "Statin treatment is widely used in both primary and secondary prevention of diseases in which hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor, for example, ischaemic heart disease. The development of ulcerative colitis as an adverse reaction to simvastatin is reported, which, despite withdrawal of the drug, proved fatal. The adverse reaction profile of the statins is reviewed, which suggests that this is a class effect and not one limited to simvastatin.", 
    "73": "There have been eight major studies assessing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) vs. medical therapy in the past 10 years. Women were inadequately represented in many of these studies, but because of similar long-term survival curves in women and men, most of the PCI data can be applied to women until more trials are published. According to currently available data, PCI offers greater angina relief and improvement in exercise tolerance than medicine alone, but has a greater risk of procedure-related complications in women. As a result of the rapid advancement of cardiovascular therapy, many of these studies did not incorporate optimal medical therapy or current PCI therapies. It is likely that for most patients (including women) with moderate angina, the best management may be a combination of PCI, medical therapy, and lifestyle changes.", 
    "74": "During the last decade, the development of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as 'statins', has contributed greatly to cholesterol lowering therapy and cardiovascular risk reduction. These agents are well tolerated and efficacious. Data on nearly 30,000 patients from five long-term randomised, placebo-controlled trials of statins have clearly demonstrated that a broad range of individuals can benefit from such therapy. These include men or women, younger or older individuals, those with elevated or normal cholesterol levels, with or without myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease, with or without hypertension or diabetes mellitus, and those who are smokers or non-smokers. Benefits include reductions in the risks for myocardial infarction, and coronary, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, stroke and the need for coronary revascularisation. Results of the recently completed Heart Protection Trial have clearly confirmed the results of the earlier trials and support the use of statin therapy in secondary prevention. The role of statins in acute coronary syndromes is being actively evaluated and appears promising. In primary prevention, the data are not as convincing and generalisations cannot be made as to whether, and in which subgroup, drug therapy to lower low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol should be initiated. There are important cost implications to consider and the use of statin therapy has to be judged on an individual basis, particularly in those with high or very high LDL cholesterol levels and/or with multiple risk factors rendering them at high short- and long-term risk of coronary heart disease. There is evidence of a 'care gap' in translating trial data into practice, even in secondary prevention, and this needs closing in order to improve patient outcomes.", 
    "75": "Recent epidemiological data have documented associations between C-reactive protein (CRP), the prototypical acute phase response protein, and cardiovascular disease in general population. Given the lipoprotein binding and complement activation of CRP and its localization in atherosclerotic vessels, there is a strong likelihood that CRP may be involved in the atherosclerotic process. Statin therapy seems to have action anti-atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular atherosclerotic inflammation: clinical trials are needed. This review would be an update on the topic.", 
    "76": "A large proportion of patients have both hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, two of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Statins are the most widely used drugs for the treatment of plasma lipid abnormalities and have been reported to interact with elevated blood pressure. A reduction in blood pressure associated with the use of these agents has been reported in patients with untreated hypertension and in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. This effect on blood pressure control has also been observed in diabetic patients. The mechanism responsible for the hypotensive effect seems to be largely independent of the effect of statins on plasma cholesterol, and probably is related to the interaction of the medications with endothelial function or angiotensin II receptors. The capacity of statins to improve blood pressure control may represent a useful tool for improvement in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "77": "Arterial stiffness assessed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease. We studied the preventive effects of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, fluvastatin, on arterial PWV values in this population.", 
    "78": "Twenty-two patients with normal serum lipid levels received fluvastatin (20 mg/day p.o.) or a placebo for 6 months. Their serum lipid levels, serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial PWV, and ankle brachial indexes (ABI) were determined before, and 3 and 6 months after taking the medication to evaluate arterial stiffness.", 
    "79": "At the beginning of the follow-up, there were no differences in age, blood pressure, body mass index, serum haemoglobin A1c level, serum CRP level, serum lipid levels, PWV or ABI between the placebo- (n=10) and the fluvastatin-treated patients (n=12). After 6 months, the PWV and the serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level increased significantly (from 1969+/-140 to 2326+/-190 cm/s and 70.4+/-13.8 to 91.8+/-15.5 U/l, respectively) in the placebo-treated patients. However, the fluvastatin group had a significantly reduced PWV (from 1991+/-162 to 1709+/-134 cm/s), oxidized LDL-C serum levels (from 89.0+/-9.6 to 73.0+/-5.8 U/l) and CRP serum levels (from 0.97+/-0.32 to 0.26+/-0.16 mg/dl) compared with those in the placebo group.",

    "81": "The anti-atherosclerosis mechanisms of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) occur via both cholesterol-dependent and cholesterol-independent mechanisms. The present study used aortic and cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) from rat to investigate whether atorvastatin and mevastatin affect basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced SMC proliferation and the mRNA expression of endothelin A (ET(A)) and endothelin B (ET(B)) receptors. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT and real-time PCR was used to quantify ET(A) and ET(B) receptor mRNA. bFGF-induced concentration and time dependent SMC proliferation and up-regulation of the mRNA expression of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors inhibited bFGF-induced proliferation of SMC (P<0.01). In aortic SMC atorvastatin and mevastatin significantly inhibited bFGF-induced mRNA expression of endothelin ET(A) and ET(B) receptors (P<0.05). Although in cerebral SMC the inhibitory effect of the statins was comparable in size with that seen in aortic SMC, only reached borderline significance (P=0.06) for ET(A) receptor mRNA but not for ET(B). The findings suggested a direct effect of statins on the vascular wall beyond their well-known lipid lowering effect in anti-atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the specific antagonists of ET(A) and ET(B) receptors (FR139317 and BQ788, respectively) significantly inhibited bFGF-induced SMC proliferation (P<0.001). The results suggested that endothelin receptors and the mevalonate pathway were involved in bFGF-induced SMC proliferation.", 
    "82": "To further reduce low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), atorvastatin treatment was investigated in patients with homozygous (n = 4) and heterozygous (n = 10) familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) undergoing LDL-apheresis. After a wash-out period of 4 weeks, atorvastatin therapy was administered in escalating doses (10 up to 80 mg/d). LDL-apheresis was performed at weekly intervals during the entire study period. The LDL-C concentration decreased from 240 +/- 35 mg/dL after the wash-out period to 206 +/- 63 mg/dL during treatment with 10 mg atorvastatin. Four weeks of treatment with 80 mg atorvastatin resulted in an additional 24% (P <.05) reduction in LDL-C. LDL-C increased from 28.8 +/- 14.2 mg/dL immediately after apheresis to 156.6 +/- 25.5 mg/dL at day 7. LDL-C values remained below the recommended target range for an extended duration of 48 hours in atorvastatin-treated patients, but not in those without concomitant lipid-lowering drug therapy. The levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and plasma fibrinogen were unchanged during the entire study period. No adverse events were observed with atorvastatin treatment. Finally, high-dose atorvastatin therapy resulted in a 40% reduction in LDL-apheresis sessions in these patients. Our results show that LDL-C reduction by atorvastatin is a safe and effective therapy in LDL-apheresis patients with severe heterozygous or homozygous FH.", 
    "83": "We report the case of a man whose high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and the ratios of total cholesterol to HDL-C and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to HDL-C worsened dramatically during pravastatin treatment. After 3 years, pravastatin was replaced by fenofibrate. The result was spectacular. The HDL-C increased to at least twice the level obtained during pravastatin.", 
    "84": "Increased vascular superoxide anion (O(2)(-)) formation is essentially involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Chronic hyperglycemia induces endothelial dysfunction, probably due to increased formation of reactive oxygen intermediates. However, little is known about the localization, modulators, and molecular mechanisms of vascular O(2)(-) formation during hyperglycemia. In porcine coronary segments, high glucose significantly increased O(2)(-) formation (1,703.5 +/- 394.9 vs. 834.1 +/- 91.7 units/mg for control, n = 64, P < 0.05; measured by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence). This effect was completely blocked after removal of the endothelium. Coincubation with 10 micromol/l atorvastatin, a lipophilic inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, attenuated basal and glucose-induced O(2)(-) formation (328.1 +/- 46.5 and 332.8 +/- 50.3 units/mg, P < 0.05 vs. without atorvastatin). Incubation with mevalonic acid reversed this effect. High glucose increased mRNA expression of the oxidase subunit p22(phox), which was blocked by 10 micromol/l atorvastatin, whereas expression of gp91(phox) was unchanged. In conclusion, glucose-induced increase of vascular O(2)(-) formation is endothelium dependent and is probably mediated by increased p22(phox) subunit expression. Beneficial effects of statins in diabetic patients may be explained in part by attenuation of vascular O(2)(-) formation independent of lipid lowering.", 
    "85": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover study, 15 stable mild hyperglycemic patients without treatment and with features of metabolic syndrome were treated with cerivastatin (0.4 mg/day) or placebo for 3 months. The insulin sensitivity index during the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (EHC; 5.4 mmol/l; 80 mU x m(-2) x min(-1)) was increased by cerivastatin treatment (66.39 +/- 3.9 nmol x lean body mass [LBM](-1) x min(-1) x pmol(-1) x l(-1)) as compared with placebo (58.37 +/- 3.69 nmol x LBM(-1) x min(-1) x pmol(-1) x l(- 1); P < 0.01) by 13.7%. Glucose oxidation during EHC was significantly higher with statin treatment (16.1 +/- 1.37 micromol x LBM(-1) x min(-1)) as compared with placebo (14.58 +/- 1.48 micromol x LBM(-1) x min(-1); P < 0.05). During hyperinsulinemia (approximately 800 pmol/l) in EHC steady-state, lipid oxidation was significantly decreased and respiratory quotient was significantly increased with statin treatment (0.33 +/- 0.05 mg x LBM(-1) x min(- 1), 0.94 +/- 0.01) as compared with placebo (0.48 +/- 0.06 mg x LBM(-1) x min(-1), 0.91 +/- 0.01; P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). During statin treatment, the first-phase insulin response increased from 2.07 +/- 0.28 to 2.82 +/- 0.38 pmol x l(-1) x pmol(-1) (P < 0.05). The second phase of insulin responses examined by C-peptide and insulin levels averaged during the hyperglycemic clamp (20 mmol/l) was unchanged. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that 0.4 mg cerivastatin therapy improves first-phase insulin secretion and increases insulin-mediated glucose uptake and respiratory quotient in the early state of obese type 2 diabetes.", 
    "86": "Hepatic accumulation of lipid substrates perturbs apolipoproteinB-100 (apoB) metabolism in insulin-resistant, obese subjects and may account for increased risk of cardiovascular disease. In a placebo-controlled trial, we examined the independent and combined effects of decreasing cholesterol synthesis with atorvastatin (40 mg/day) and triglyceride synthesis with fish oils (4 g/day) on apoB kinetics. The subjects were 48 viscerally obese, insulin-resistant men with dyslipidemia who were studied in a fasted state. We found that atorvastatin significantly decreased plasma apoB-containing lipoproteins (P < 0.001, main effect) through increases in the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of VLDL-, IDL-, and LDL-apoB (P < 0.01). Fish oils significantly decreased plasma levels of triglycerides and VLDL-apoB (P < 0.001), decreased the VLDL-apoB secretion rate (P < 0.01), but increased the conversion of VLDL to LDL (P < 0.001). Compared with placebo, combined treatment with atorvastatin and fish oils decreased VLDL-apoB secretion (P < 0.03) and increased the FCR of apoB in each lipoprotein fraction (P < 0.03) and the percent conversion of VLDL to LDL (P < 0.05). None of the treatments altered insulin resistance. In conclusion, in visceral obesity, atorvastatin increased hepatic clearance of all apoB-containing lipoproteins, whereas fish oils decreased hepatic secretion of VLDL-apoB. The differential effects of atorvastatin and fish oils on apoB kinetics support their combined use in correcting defective apoB metabolism in obese, insulin-resistant subjects.", 
    "87": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are drugs very effective to decrease low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In addition, a number of studies suggest that statins have other beneficial clinical effects beyond cholesterol lowering. We recently reported that statins decrease nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) binding activity in monocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. We now explored the effect of two different statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin, in the activation of the octamer transcription factor Oct-1 on the monocytic cell line THP-1. Oct-1 is a nuclear factor that represses the transcription of proinflammatory genes such as interleukin-8, CD11c/CD18, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). Low concentrations of both statins increased Oct-1 DNA binding activity (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) that was resolved into two specific bands. The upper one was supershifted by preincubation of nuclear extracts with anti-Oct-1 antibody. The lower one was supershifted by preincubation of nuclear extracts with an anti-Oct-2 antibody, also partially competed with 100 mol/l excess of cold activator protein-1 (AP-1) and attenuated by anti-c-Jun antibody. Both statins increased Oct-1 and Oct-2 nuclear protein levels (Western blot). In contrast, neither had any effect on PMA-differentiated cells, suggesting a distinct sensitivity between circulating monocytes and resident tissular macrophages. In addition, statins did not increase Oct-lipoprotein lipase binding activity that contains an Oct-1 binding element. The mRNA expression of interleukin-8, a chemokine containing Oct sites in its promoter, was diminished by statin pretreatment. Our results indicate that simvastatin and atorvastatin increase the activity of the transcriptional repressor Oct-1 in mononuclear cells, and could thus contribute to decrease the activation of these cells. These data suggest a possible novel mechanism supporting a certain anti-inflammatory effect of these two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "88": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) improve endothelial function. We determined whether withdrawal of statin therapy affects endothelium-dependent relaxation in mice and studied the underlying mechanism. Mice were treated with daily injections of cerivastatin (2 mg/kg per day SC), atorvastatin (1 and 10 mg/kg per day SC), or placebo. Vascular reactivity was studied in aortic rings from these mice after 10 days of treatment and after cessation of therapy for several days. Both statins improved endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. Compared with control, withdrawal of statin treatment transiently (from day 4 to 7) attenuated endothelium-dependent relaxation. In vessels from animals subjected to atorvastatin withdrawal, the antioxidant tiron restored relaxations. Vascular superoxide anion generation was unaffected by statin therapy but was increased during withdrawal. In mice lacking the gp91phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase, no attenuation of acetylcholine-induced relaxation and no increase in superoxide generation were observed after withdrawal of atorvastatin. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, statins, which decrease the membrane association of NADPH oxidase-activating Rac-1, increased the activity of this GTPase in whole-cell lysates. Withdrawal of statins induced a translocation of Rac-1 from the cytosol to the membrane and transiently increased NADPH-induced lucigenin chemiluminescence in membrane preparations. Rac-1 inactivation by Clostridium difficile toxin B inhibited the cerivastatin-induced oxygen radical production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These observations indicate that the withdrawal of statins induces endothelial dysfunction. The underlying mechanism involves activation of a gp91phox-containing NADPH oxidase by Rac-1 and the subsequent scavenging of endothelium-derived NO by superoxide anions generated from this enzyme.", 
    "89": "Angiogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis and in the treatment of coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease. Here, cholesterol-lowering agents, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, are shown to interfere with angiogenesis. In vivo, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin dose-dependently inhibited capillary growth in both vascular endothelial growth factor-stimulated chick chorioallantoic membranes and basic fibroblast growth factor-stimulated mouse corneas. In vitro, the development of tubelike structures by human microvascular endothelial cells cultured on 3D collagen gels was inhibited at simvastatin concentrations similar to those found in the serum of patients on therapeutic doses of this agent. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors interfered with angiogenesis via inhibition of the geranylgeranylation and membrane localization of RhoA. Simvastatin inhibited membrane localization of RhoA with a concentration dependence similar to that for the inhibition of tube formation, whereas geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, the substrate for the geranylgeranylation of Rho, reversed the effect of simvastatin on tube formation and on the membrane localization of RhoA. Furthermore, tube formation was inhibited by GGTI, a specific inhibitor of the geranylgeranylation of Rho; by C3 exotoxin, which inactivates Rho; and by the adenoviral expression of a dominant-negative RhoA mutant. The expression of a dominant-activating RhoA mutant reversed the effect of simvastatin on tube formation. Finally, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors inhibited signaling by vascular endothelial growth factor, Akt, and focal adhesion kinase, three RhoA-dependent pathways known to be involved in angiogenesis. This study demonstrates a new relationship between lipid metabolism and angiogenesis and an antiangiogenic effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with possible important therapeutic implications.",

Subsequently, cardiac electron beam computed tomography was performed before and during intravenous infusion of adenosine and dobutamine, and MP and PI were calculated.", 
    "93": "Total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were similarly and significantly increased in HC and HC+S animals compared with N. Basal MP was similar in all groups. Myocardial perfusion significantly increased in response to either adenosine or dobutamine in N and HC+S animals. Dobutamine also significantly increased MP in HC animals. However, the changes of MP in response to either drug were significantly lower in the HC group compared with the other two groups (p < 0.01 for adenosine and p < 0.05 for dobutamine vs. N and HC+S). Basal PI was similar in all groups and was not altered by either drug in N and HC+S animals. In contrast, PI significantly increased in HC pigs during infusion of either adenosine (p < 0.001) or dobutamine (p < 0.05).",

    "95": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase inhibitors), apart from lowering plasma cholesterol, modulate other processes involved in atherogenesis. Paraoxonase (PON), contained in plasma high density lipoproteins, protects plasma lipoproteins from oxidative damage and is a potentially atheroprotective enzyme. We investigated the effect of cerivastatin on oxidant-antioxidant balance and plasma PON activity. The adult male Wistar rats received cerivastatin at a dose of 0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. Then, plasma concentration of lipid peroxidation products, total antioxidant capacity and PON activity were assayed. Plasma level of lipid peroxidation products was unchanged in low-dose group but decreased significantly in animals receiving high dose of cerivastatin. In this group, the concentration of malonyldialdehyde and 4-hydroxydialkenals was reduced by 46.6% whereas the level of lipid hydroperoxides was lowered by 59.3%. Total plasma antioxidant capacity increased in low-dose group by 22.3% and in high-dose group by 27.2%. PON activity toward paraoxon decreased by 16.1% and 11.6% in low- and high-dose groups, respectively. The activity toward phenyl acetate, which better corresponds with enzyme concentration, declined by 74.2% and 78.4% following lower and higher dose treatment, respectively. PON/arylesterase ratio raised in cerivastatin-treated rats (low dose: +227.4%, high dose: +328.2%). Cerivastatin had no effect on total plasma cholesterol but significantly decreased triglyceride level by 34.6% in low-dose and by 31.2% in high-dose group. These results indicate that cerivastatin decreases the level of oxidative stress, improves plasma antioxidant defense and modulates paraoxonase activity. These effects can contribute to pleiotropic actions of statins in the cardiovascular system.", 
    "96": "Interstitial fibrosis is recognised as the best histological predictor of progressive renal disease. Myofibroblasts contribute to this process through several functions including hyperproliferation, collagen and collagenase synthesis and reorganisation of extracellular matrix. Recent limited in vitro studies suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors may reduce renal injury not only through their lipid-lowering effects but also by antagonising myofibroblast function. This study therefore examined the effects of lovastatin on the above interstitial myofibroblast behaviours in vitro. Primary cultures of rat renal cortical myofibroblasts were grown by explantation and characterised by immunohistochemistry. Dose response effects of lovastatin (0, 15, 30 microM) in DMEM and 10% FCS were examined on myofibroblast kinetics, total collagen synthesis, collagen I lattice contraction and actin filament rearrangement. Lovastatin decreased myofibroblast proliferation and growth. Likewise, collagen I lattice contraction and actin filament rearrangement were partially inhibited when lovastatin was added at 30 microM. In addition, lovastatin decreased both collagen and collagenase synthesis. Our results suggest that myofibroblast function may be downregulated by lovastatin in vitro. Although a decrease in myofibroblast activity may offer potential benefit in the prevention of progressive scarring, further studies will be necessary to determine the relative importance of these functions.", 
    "97": "In this study 43 patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome were randomly distributed into 2 age- and sex-matched groups. The first group was given fluvastatin while the second was used as control. The cases in the 2 groups were evaluated clinically, biochemically (creatinine clearance, albumin, 24-hour proteinuria, and lipogram), neurologically, and histopathologically (examination of renal biopsies obtained basally and after 1 year of treatment with fluvastatin). In the fluvastatin-treated group but not in the control group, we observed a significant reduction in cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride. Clinical and laboratory assessment showed satisfactory tolerance of the drug by the patients. Proteinuria, serum albumin and creatinine clearance values were significantly better in the statin-treated patients. There was no difference in glomerular sclerosis between the 2 groups while interstitial fibrosis and renal fat deposits were less in the statin-treated group. The reduction in renal fat deposits in the statin-treated group was highly significant, while that of interstitial fibrosis was not. We conclude that: (1) statin can be safely and effectively used in the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with persistent idiopathic nephrotic syndrome; (2) control of dyslipidemia in nephrotic patients is associated with better control of proteinuria and creatinine clearance; (3) statin treatment may cause regression of renal fat deposits in patients with nephrotic syndrome, and (4) longer term studies are still required to study further possible beneficial effects on renal histology and disease progression.",

Individual studies have shown interventions to reduce total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, especially with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), to be of benefit in reducing CHD and stroke events in those with a history of coronary heart disease. However, the relation of serum cholesterol and cholesterol sub-fractions with cerebrovascular disease is less clear.

Fixed effects analysis showed no evidence of a difference in stroke recurrence between the treatment and placebo groups for those with a previous history of stroke or TIA (odds ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 1.30). In addition there was also no evidence, based on two studies, that intervention reduced the odds of all cause mortality (odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.39) nor, from one study, that there was any effect on subsequent vascular events (odds ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.89).", 
    "104": "These trials do not provide evidence for a benefit, or harm, from interventions to alter serum lipid levels in patients with a history solely of cerebrovascular disease. Their use, therefore, cannot yet be recommended routinely in this patient group, but ischaemic stroke patients with a history of myocardial infarction should receive statin therapy along the lines of the previous recommendations for those patients with a history of myocardial ischaemia. There are currently three ongoing trials which will recruit approximately 30,000 patients, including those with a history of stroke, and the results of these trials may have a significant effect on these conclusions.", 
    "105": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methyl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins, specifically inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA in the liver, thereby inhibiting the rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis and so reducing plasma cholesterol levels. Numerous studies have consistently demonstrated that cholesterol lowering with statin therapy reduces morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease, whilst recent evidence has demonstrated that benefits of statin therapy may also extend into stroke prevention. Since hypercholesterolaemia is a chronic condition, the long-term safety and tolerability of these agents is an important issue. Numerous large-scale clinical trials have consistently demonstrated a positive safety and tolerability profile for statins. Hepatic, renal and muscular systems are rarely affected during statin therapy, with adverse reactions involving skeletal muscle being the most common, ranging from mild myopathy to myositis and occasionally to rhabdomyolysis and death. Postmarketing data supports the positive safety and tolerability profile of statins, with an overall adverse event frequency of less than 0.5% and a myotoxicity event rate of less than 0.1%. The recent withdrawal of cerivastatin from the world market due to deaths from rhabdomyolysis has, however, focused attention on the risk of adverse events and in particular myotoxicity associated with statins. Indeed, initial clinical trial data supports postmarketing data, demonstrating a higher incidence of myotoxicity associated with cerivastatin, particularly when used in combination with fibrates. The potential mechanisms underlying statin-induced myotoxicity are complex with no clear consensus of opinion. Candidate mechanisms include intracellular depletion of essential metabolites and destabilisation of cell membranes, resulting in increased cytotoxicity. Cytochrome P450 3A4 is the main isoenzyme involved in statin metabolism. Reduced activity of this enzyme due to either reduced expression or inhibition by other drugs prescribed concomitantly such as cyclosporin or itraconazole may increase drug bioavailability and the risk of myotoxicity. Such factors may partly account for the interindividual variability in susceptibility to statin-induced myotoxicity, although other as of yet unclarified, genetic factors may also be involved. The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased with combination fibrate-statin therapy, with initial evidence suggesting that gemfibrozil-statin combination may particularly increase the risk of myotoxicity, with pharmacodynamic as well as pharmacokinetic mechanisms being involved.", 
    "106": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major cause of death in industrialised societies, and elevated serum lipids are a significant, highly prevalent and undertreated risk factor for this condition. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have revolutionised the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, and results from large-scale, long-term clinical trials have shown that the substantial reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) achieved with these drugs are associated with dramatic decreases in cardiovascular risk. Results from recent comparative clinical trials that have included a new drug in this class, rosuvastatin (Crestor), have demonstrated that it is significantly superior to atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin in reducing total cholesterol, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B (Apo B). It is also significantly more effective than atorvastatin in increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I). Rosuvastatin was also superior to all these agents in helping patients meet European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) and National Cholesterol Education Programme (NCEP) goals for LDL-C. The results of an increasing number of studies indicate that statins have a wide range of pleiotropic properties that almost certainly contribute to their ability to decrease cardiovascular risk and may also make them valuable for treatment of other diseases. These actions include plaque stabilisation, improvement of endothelial function, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, reduction of expression of adhesion molecules, prevention of cholesterol esterification and accumulation, reduction of secretion of matrix metalloproteinases by macrophages, reduction of platelet activity, reduction of formation of thrombogenic factors, chemoprotection and induction of bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2). Further exploration of these actions will provide key information about class effects and properties of specific members of this highly useful group of drugs.", 
    "107": "The pathophysiology of stroke in humans is much more complex than what is typically studied in animal models. Embolic stroke models are more complex than pure ischemia models, but are more representative of human disease and may be particularly useful in the study of new therapeutic strategies. Vascular damage is a prominent feature of embolic stroke, and may be a useful therapeutic target. Serotonin antagonists, adenosine-regulating agents, free radical scavengers, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are all potentially valuable agents in treating vascular damage after stroke. These agents facilitate decreased infarction volume, hemorrhage, and improved cerebral bloodflow.",

After being starved, cultured VSMCs were stimulated by 5% fetal bovine serum with either various concentrations of cerivastatin or 10-4 M of mevalonate. Cerivastatin dose-dependently decreased the values of [3H]-thymidine incorporation and cell numbers and the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2. It also suppressed the level of proliferative cell nuclear antigen in a dose-dependent manner. These reductions were abolished by the addition of mevalonate. Similarly, the level of phosphorylated p38 was also decreased by cerivastatin. In contrast, cerivastatin dose-dependently activated the phosphorylation of both c-jun NH2-terminal protein kinase and activating transcription factor-2, and these activations were abolished by the addition of mevalonate. The levels of phosphorylated Akt and p70 S6 kinase as well as those of Bcl-2 were dose-dependently reduced by cerivastatin, and these reductions were abolished by the addition of mevalonate. Cerivastatin could dose-dependently elevate the levels of CPP32/caspase-3 activity and cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments in VSMCs without causing cytotoxicity. These results indicate that cerivastatin suppresses cell survival and activates the apoptotic cellular signaling in VSMCs, suggesting that it could be effective for preventing the progression of restenosis after angioplasty.",

The objective was to evaluate the vascular effect of long-term treatment with statins on isolated rat aorta and their ability to prevent the acute toxicity of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs) compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Four groups of Wistar rats were treated for 5 weeks. Group 1 received pravastatin 20 mg/kg/d orally; group 2 received atorvastatin 10 mg/kg/d; group 3 received ciprofibrate 25 mg/kg/d; and group 4 served as control. Total cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels were not altered, except in group 3, in which both parameters were decreased. The inhibitory effect of the endothelium on serotonin-induced contractions was significantly increased in group 1. A significant leftward shift of the concentration-response curves to acetylcholine (1 nM-0.1 mM) was observed in group 1 but the maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was similar in the four groups. In contrast, in the presence of human Cu2+-oxLDL (300 microg/ml, 30 min of preincubation), the maximal relaxation to acetylcholine was markedly decreased (p < 0.02) in groups 3 and 4 versus that of groups 1 and 2. No difference in superoxide accumulation was observed by the chemiluminescence technique. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), measured by enzyme immunoassay in aortic tissues, was increased in group 1 in the presence of superoxide dismutase. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was not altered (Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). In aortas isolated from a fifth group of rats treated with an ACE inhibitor (ramipril 10 mg/kg/d for 6 weeks), similar results to those of group 1 were observed except that the eNOS abundance was significantly enhanced. Thus, long-term statin treatment upregulates the eNOS pathway and attenuates the acute toxicity of human oxLDL. In contrast to chronic ACE inhibition, the eNOS abundance is not increased.",

The data indicate that severe muscular side effects are rare. Patients and their doctors, however, easily overlook mild ones. Myopathic symptoms without any known biochemical correlate are not rare. No general guideline exists about exact diagnosis and differential diagnosis. Strict adherence to the measures of life-style change and performance of regular exercise can even further enhance significantly these side effects. Much more research should be directed onto the pathophysiological (genetic?) background to finally evaluate possible therapeutic consequences rather than simply to withdraw or change the respective statin.",

LOX-1 activation also plays an important role in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. A number of studies show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce total LDL cholesterol and exert a cardioprotective effect. We examined the modulation of LOX-1 expression and its function by two different statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin, in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). We observed that ox-LDL (40 microg/ml) treatment up-regulated the expression of E- and P-selectins, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in HCAECs. Ox-LDL mediated these effects via LOX-1, since antisense to LOX-1 mRNA decreased LOX-1 expression and subsequent adhesion molecule expression. Pretreatment of HCAECs with simvastatin or atorvastatin (1 and 10 microM) reduced ox-LDL-induced expression of LOX-1 as well as adhesion molecules (all P < 0.05). A high concentration of statins (10 microM) was more potent than the low concentration (1 microM) (P < 0.05). Both statins reduced ox-LDL-mediated activation of the redox-sensitive nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) but not AP-1. These observations indicate that LOX-1 activation plays an important role in ox-LDL-induced expression of adhesion molecules. Inhibition of expression of LOX-1 and adhesion molecules and activation of NF-kappaB may be another mechanism of beneficial effects of statins in vascular diseases.",

Employing the Statistical Institute of Jamaica's (STATIN) two-stage stratified random sampling design, preselected house-holds were visited. Non-response was documented and considered in the final analysis. Only individuals 15 years and older were allowed to participate in the study. The 2,064 subjects who participated were the basis for estimates of hypertension. Following logistic regression analysis, the main risk factors for hypertension are being female, advancing age, obesity, having diabetes and having a family history of hypertension. Jamaica has a point prevalence of hypertension of 30.8% in the 15-and-over age group. These findings would greatly assist in formulating policies to deal with this scourge of society.", 
    "145": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the largest single killer of Americans. Epidemiologic trials have indicted low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) as directly correlating with CHD events, and clinical trials confirmed that lipid-lowering therapy decreases the risk of CHD events. The literature also indicates that only about 18% of these patients are treated to their goal LDL levels. New guidelines from the National Cholesterol Education Program extend the LDL-lowering recommendations, add a new non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL) goal for patients with hypertriglyceridemia, and increase the number of drug-eligible patients from about 15 to 36 million. Most of those who are eligible for lipid-altering drug therapy have the highest CHD risk and require the most aggressive treatment to achieve goals. This presents a challenge to clinicians: how best to achieve LDL and non-HDL goals. Statins are the most effective agents for lowering LDL and one of the most effective for lowering non-HDL. This efficacy and the ability to reduce CHD risk were well documented in a number of randomized clinical trials. When statin monotherapy fails to achieve goals, a bile acid resin, niacin, or both may be added to lower LDL further, or a fibrate, niacin, or fish oils may be added to lower non-HDL further. Drugs are under development that may enhance our ability to reach LDL and non-HDL goals. Included are a group of so-called super statins, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin; agents that interfere with cholesterol or bile acid transport in the gut, such as ezetimibe; and dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists that have both fibrate and thiazolidinedione-like effects.", 
    "146": "31 cases of atherosclerosis (AS) were treated with Jiang Zhi Tong Mai Fang ([symbol: see text], formula of JZTMF), and its effect was compared with 30 cases treated with lovastatin in the control group. Clinically, the JZTMF formula showed an effect of regulating blood lipids, and therefore it was antiatherosclerotic. The mechanism is, probably, restoration of the function of endothelial cells (EC) by increasing the synthesis of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and decreasing the release of endothelin (ET) as evidenced in the experimental study.", 
    "147": "To assess the significance, mechanisms and therapy of impaired high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH).", 
    "148": "Review of epidemiological, metabolic and clinical literature with synthetic analysis of data referring to HDL. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS AND SYNTHESIS: Low HDL is a powerful risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) in FH. Low HDL in FH is a metabolic sequel of insulin resistance, which is the central feature of the visceral accumulation of adipose tissue acquired in later life. Insulin resistance increases hepatic secretion of triglycerides that subsequently results in remodelling of holo-HDL particles and enhanced catabolism of apolipoprotein A-I. Gene-gene and gene-environment interactions may contribute to the pathogenesis of low HDL in FH. Low HDL may also point to other cardiovascular risk factors, such as hyper-remnantaemia, increased small dense low-density lipoproteins (LDL), procoagulopathy and vascular insulin resistance. Visceral obesity should be vigorously identified and treated in FH. Judicious addition of fish oils, niacin and fibrates to a statin may be required to optimise HDL metabolism. Extracorporeal removal of LDL cholesterol should aim not to extract HDL from plasma.", 
    "149": "With the increasing incidence of obesity in the community, the metabolic syndrome will overmanifest in patients with FH. Impaired HDL metabolism is an important consequence of this syndrome for FH patients, because it will per se or in collusion with other associated risk factors accelerate the progression of atherosclerosis and CAD. Dysregulation of HDL metabolism principally results from hepatic insulin resistance and remodelling of HDL particles. Obesity should be prevented and aggressively treated in FH and use of a safe combination drug regimen considered to correct the dysmetabolism of HDL in these patients.", 
    "150": "Dyslipidemia (increased triglyceride and low high-density lipoprotein [HDL] levels, with normal or slightly increased total cholesterol levels) is a common characteristic of type 2 diabetics and a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of atorvastatin in a cohort of type 2 diabetics.", 
    "151": "Participants were divided into 3 groups on the basis of whether they had evidence of myocardial infarction or coronary lesions (group A), a family history of hypercholesterolemia (and/or cardiovascular diseases) and total cholesterol levels constantly above 270 mg/dL in blood samples taken at regular 4-month intervals and previously never at target level (group B), or clinical and/or instrumental (electrocardiogram) evidence of cardiovascular risk (group C). Their mean age was 64 +/- 7 years, known disease duration 0.5 +/- 3 years, body mass index (BMI) 27.7 +/- 1.3 Kg/m2, and haemoglobin A1c 8 +/- 0.6%. Total cholesterol was 256 +/- 24 mg/dL in group A, 298 +/- 25 mg/dL in group B and 244 +/- 31 mg/dL in group C (p < 0.05: group B vs groups A and C). HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) was 45 +/- 7 mg/dL, triglycerides 225 +/- 20 mg/dL, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) respectively 144 +/- 7 and 85 +/- 8 mmHg, fibrinogen 330 +/- 23 mg/dL and microalbuminuria 58 +/- 9 mg/L. Eighteen months' atorvastatin treatment (10 mg/day in 106 subjects, 20 mg in 14 subjects, 30 mg in 5 subjects, and 40 mg in 30 subjects) led to a significant decrease in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels (p < 0.01), with about 86% of the patients achieving target levels, and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in HDL-C. There was a significant decrease in fibrinogen, microalbuminuria and DBP (p < 0.01), without any change in diet, BMI, physical activity or antihypertensive treatment. No new cardiovascular events or hospital admissions due to cardiovascular diseases were recorded during the 18 months of the study.", 
    "152": "These long-term treatment findings confirm and validate previous medium-term results, and suggest that atorvastatin therapy is effective and safe in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes.", 
    "153": "It has been reported that atorvastatin increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) more in patients with low than in those with high baseline HDL-C levels. This may have a biological explanation, but also suggests a statistical artifact known as the regression to the mean.", 
    "154": "Atorvastatin 10 mg/day led to a 4% increase in HDL-C after two months in 67/121 patients with hypercholesterolemia (55%), who had lower baseline HDL-C levels than the patients in whom HDL-C did not increase. In the patients with baseline HDL-C below the median, HDL-C significantly increased whereas no change was observed in patients with baseline HDL-C above the median. The correlation coefficient between pre- and post-treatment HDL-C was 0.84, thus suggesting a regression to the mean. However, the regression artifact did not entirely explain the increase in HDL-C in patients with low baseline HDL-C or the lack of an increase in those with high baseline HDL-C. The adjusted mean increase was 5.4% in patients with low pretreatment HDL-C, and 2.4% in the patients with high pretreatment HDL-C. Multiple regression analysis with the changes in HDL-C as the dependent variable showed that baseline HDL-C and the changes in serum triglycerides independently contributed to the change in HDL-C levels.", 
    "155": "Atorvastatin 10 mg/day increases HDL-C more in patients with low pretreatment HDL-C levels, an effect that seems to be related to the hypotriglyceridemic activity of the drug.", 
    "156": "Recent large-scale trials have consistently documented the fact that a 25-35% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) can delay the progression of atherosclerosis. This raises the question as to how much it is possible to reduce serum cholesterol using feasible therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of a triple therapy combining bile acid malabsorption with the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and absorption.", 
    "157": "Eleven consecutive hypercholesterolemic coronary patients from Lipid Clinics on a low-fat, low-cholesterol baseline diet added simvastatin (20 mg/day) for three months, and then dietary plant stanol ester margarine (2.25 g of stanols/day) for eight weeks; finally, cholestyramine 8 g/day was added for another eight weeks. This was a before-after trial, in which the results of each period were compared with baseline and those of the previous period. Serum lipids were quantitated using commercial kits, and serum sterols by means of gas-liquid chromatography. Simvastatin lowered LDL-C by 39% (p < 0.001), and additional stanol ester margarine by a further 13% (p < 0.05). The triple treatment led to 67% reduction from baseline (p < 0.001), with all LDL-C values being < 2.6 mmol/L, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by 15% (p < 0.01). It also increased the serum lathosterol/cholesterol ratio (p < 0.01), thus indicating an upregulation of cholesterol synthesis, and increased the serum sitosterol ratio (p < 0.01) despite the simultaneous consumption of plant stanols.", 
    "158": "The massive reduction in LDL and increase in HDL-C obtained using our triple therapy suggests that the combination of stanol ester with only moderate doses of statin and resin makes it possible to control LDL-C levels effectively in hypercholesterolemic subjects.", 
    "159": "To identify an appropriate animal model for the study of drug interaction via CYP3A4 inhibition, the inhibition of in vitro mexazolam metabolism by various 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors [simvastatin (lactone), simvastatin acid, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, pravastatin lactone, and pravastatin (acid)] in male and female rat liver microsomes was investigated and compared with that by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in human liver microsomes reported previously. The metabolism of mexazolam in male and female rat liver microsomes was inhibited by all the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors examined except pravastatin (acid). The K(i) values in female rats were lower than those in male rats, demonstrating the presence of a sex difference in the inhibition potency of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors toward mexazolam. Using anti-cytochrome P450 (P450) antisera, the main P450 isozyme responsible for the metabolism of mexazolam was identified as CYP3A in female rats and CYP2C11 in male rats. Based on these results, we speculate that the sex difference in the inhibition potency of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for mexazolam observed in rats is caused by their different inhibition potencies against CYP2C11 and CYP3A isoforms. For mexazolam metabolism, the results obtained in female rats, rather than those in male rats, seem to be a much better reflection of the results in humans. Since species and sex differences were observed in P450 isozymes in the present study, our results show that establishing appropriate experimental conditions, in particular with respect to the P450 isozymes responsible for the drug metabolism in question, is indispensable for the investigation of drug interactions using rats as a model animal for humans.", 
    "160": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) after myocardial infarction is associated with diminished endothelial nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasorelaxation. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to modulate vascular tone independent of the effects on lipid lowering. We hypothesized that simvastatin restores NO-dependent vasorelaxation with CHF. We found that incubation of the normal rat aorta with 0.1 mM simvastatin for 24 h enhanced ACh-mediated vasorelaxation (P < 0.05). Moreover, simvastatin increased (P < 0.05) endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein content by >200% (82.0 +/- 14.0 vs. 21.6 +/- 7.9% II/microg). In cultured endothelial cells, simvastatin (10 and 20 microM) increased eNOS levels by 114.7 +/- 39.9 and 212.0 +/- 75.0% II/microg protein, respectively (both P < 0.05; n = 8). In the rat coronary artery ligation model, oral gavage with 20 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) simvastatin for 3 wk decreased (P < 0.05) mean arterial pressure (121 +/- 20 vs. 96.5 +/- 10.8 mmHg) and left ventricular change in pressure with time (4,500 +/- 700 vs. 4,091 +/- 1,064 mmHg/s, n = 6). Simvastatin reduced (P < 0.05) basal vasoconstriction and improved ACh-mediated vasorelaxation in CHF arterial rings. Inhibition of NO generation by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (100 microM) abolished the ACh-induced vasorelaxation in all rats. In conclusion, chronic treatment of CHF with simvastatin restores endothelial NO-dependent dysfunction and upregulates eNOS protein content in arterial tissue.", 
    "161": "Diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by high triglyceride levels; low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles; and high free fatty acid levels. Niacin reduces concentrations of triglyceride-rich and small low-density lipoprotein particles while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. It also lowers levels of free fatty acids and lipoprotein(a). However, the use of niacin in patients with diabetes has been discouraged because high doses can worsen glycemic control. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily extended-release (ER) niacin in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia.", 
    "162": "During a 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 148 patients were randomized to placebo (n = 49) or 1000 (n = 45) or 1500 mg/d (n = 52) of ER niacin. Sixty-nine patients (47%) were also receiving concomitant therapy with statins.", 
    "163": "Dose-dependent increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (+19% to +24% [P<.05] vs placebo for both niacin dosages) and reductions in triglyceride levels (-13% to -28% [P<.05] vs placebo for the 1500-mg ER niacin) were observed. Baseline and week 16 values for glycosylated hemoglobin levels were 7.13% and 7.11%, respectively, in the placebo group; 7.28% and 7.35%, respectively, in the 1000-mg ER niacin group (P=.16 vs placebo); and 7.2% and 7.5%, respectively, in the 1500-mg ER niacin group (P=.048 vs placebo). Four patients discontinued participation because of inadequate glucose control. Rates of adverse event rates other than flushing were similar for the niacin and placebo groups. Four patients discontinued participation owing to flushing (including 1 receiving placebo). No hepatotoxic effects or myopathy were observed.", 
    "164": "Low doses of ER niacin (1000 or 1500 mg/d) are a treatment option for dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes."
