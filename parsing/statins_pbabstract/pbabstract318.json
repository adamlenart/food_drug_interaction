    "0": "Rosuvastatin is a new statin with a great number of pharmacological benefits related to the capacity of modifying favorably the lipid profile but also for the selective binding with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, relative hydrophilic properties and selectivity for hepatic cells. Rosuvastatin demonstrated to be more efficacious in reducing LDL cholesterol levels than other statins and to be capable of increasing HDL cholesterol levels. It is well tolerated in a wide range of dosages maintaining its effectiveness. Many trials are ongoing with the aim to evaluate not only the efficacy of rosuvastatin in terms of surrogate endpoints but also in terms of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The usefulness of rosuvastatin will be evaluated also in selective patient populations affected by advanced renal disease or chronic heart failure. Two relevant research projects have been started recently, the GALAXY Programme, designed for evaluating the efficacy of rosuvastatin in atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease and the GISSI-HF trial planned with the aim of testing the efficacy of this statin on morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure and investigating the pharmacological effects on the pathophysiological mechanisms of heart failure.", 
    "1": "Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the western countries. Statins have greatly improved the treatment of dyslipidemias in primary and secondary prevention. Rosuvastatin is a new statin with a high efficacy in reducing LDL cholesterol levels with a good safety profile. At present data about efficacy on mortality and morbidity of this statin are not available; but a very large program of clinical trials, named GALAXY, with over 20,000 subjects in 30 countries, is ongoing. The high capacity of rosuvastatin of lowering LDL cholesterol at usual starting dose of 10 mg is a very interesting characteristic of this molecule, as it helps in reducing the need for dose titration in many patients. Rosuvastatin 10 mg reduces LDL cholesterol levels by 46.7-48.1% vs a reduction of 36.4% with atorvastatin 10 mg, 35.7% with simvastatin 20 mg, and 27.1% with pravastatin 20 mg. Dose-ranging trials have documented that reductions of LDL cholesterol increase with higher doses of rosuvastatin. The STELLAR trial (with rosuvastatin in the range of 10-80 mg vs atorvastatin 10-80 mg, simvastatin 10-80 mg and pravastatin 10-40 mg in 2431 patients) demonstrated that the mean proportional reduction achieved with rosuvastatin at various doses was greater than the one obtained with comparators. Rosuvastatin is also better than other statins in achieving the target level of LDL cholesterol recommended by the recent guidelines. The proportion of patients reaching the goal is 82% with 10 mg and it raises to 89% with 40 mg of rosuvastatin. The proportion of subjects reaching LDL cholesterol levels < 100 mg with different doses of rosuvastatin is significantly higher (p < 0.002) than the one obtained with atorvastatin at the same doses and simvastatin or pravastatin at the same or higher doses. The safety data of rosuvastatin in the dose range of 10-40 mg are similar to the ones achieved by the other statins, therefore, considering the superior efficacy of rosuvastatin in reducing the LDL cholesterol levels, the risk-benefit profile of this new molecule seems very promising.", 
    "2": "The development of more active and safe new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) will increase the armamentarium of therapeutic tools available to the physicians for antiatherosclerotic therapies. Rosuvastatin presents a promising pharmacological profile: high affinity for the enzyme, a relative high hydrophilicity, selective hepatic uptake and activity, minimal cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism. Clinically the drug displays the highest lipid-lowering efficacy in the class with a safety profile similar to the other statins. Drug interaction potential is reduced. Rosuvastatin effectively decreases triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, non-HDL cholesterol, and increases HDL cholesterol. All together these properties will favor the achievement of therapeutic goals in the treated patients.", 
    "3": "The metabolic syndrome is associated with increased morbility and mortality for cardiovascular disease. This syndrome is determined not only by metabolic alterations such as hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia but also by a chronic proinflammatory state. Another culprit in the formation and progression of vascular disease is the so-called endothelial dysfunction which is linked to insulin resistance itself. The common denominator of the metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance. The most convincing evidence for the existence of a syndrome comes from the cluster analysis which outlines four main factors: the \"metabolic factor\", the \"pressor factor\", the \"lipid factor\", and the \"obesity factor\". It is clear that the presence of the metabolic syndrome appears to identify a substantial additional cardiovascular risk above the individual risk factors. The studies available in the literature have pointed out the beneficial effects, in terms of cardiovascular mortality, of the treatment with inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins): this risk reduction has been observed despite the fact that high triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol levels, but not hypercholesterolemia, are the main features of the dyslipidemia observed in patients with this syndrome. Yet, despite a normal LDL cholesterol level, patients with this syndrome are at high risk for future cardiovascular events: for this reason treatment with statins is mandatory.", 
    "4": "Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically reduced mortality from HIV infection, transforming it in many cases to a chronic condition. However, protease inhibitors (PIs), which are integral components of most HAART regimens, are commonly associated with a host of metabolic disturbances that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with HIV infection, potentially counteracting some of the positive health effects of PIs. Dyslipidemia is of particular concern. The Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group has established preliminary guidelines to evaluate and treat PI-associated dyslipidemia. A number of strategies exist for the management of PI-based dyslipidemia in HAART recipients; their advantages and disadvantages should be considered when treating patients with HIV infection.", 
    "5": "The increase in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels is an independent determinant of cardiovascular events in long-term hemodialysis (HD) patients. Recently, statins have shown anti-inflammatory properties in addition to their lipid-lowering effect.", 
    "6": "We designed a 6-month, prospective, randomized, controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin in reducing serum CRP levels in long-term HD patients. Patients on HD therapy for at least 6 months, with autologous vascular access, were included. Patients presenting with illnesses and/or use of drugs that may affect CRP levels were excluded. After randomization, group A included 16 patients treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/d orally), and group B included 17 patients treated with placebo. Body mass index, Kt/V, normalized protein catabolic rate, mean blood pressure, and levels of hemoglobin, serum CRP, albumin, creatinine, lipids, and enzymes were recorded at baseline and after 6 months.", 
    "7": "Qualitative/quantitative parameters were homogeneous between the groups at baseline. In group A, median serum CRP levels decreased from 9 mg/L (range, 5 to 22 mg/L) at baseline to 5 mg/L (range, 3 to 16 mg/L) after 6 months (P = 0.004). In group B, values were 8 mg/L (range, 4 to 14 mg/L) at baseline and 7 mg/L (range, 3 to 17 mg/L) after 6 months (P = 0.98). Serum CRP levels were lower in group A than group B at month-4 (5 mg/L; range, 3 to 11 mg/L versus 7 mg/L; range, 3 to 10 mg/L, respectively; P = 0.054) and month-6 evaluations (5 mg/L; range, 3 to 16 mg/L versus 7 mg/L; range, 3 to 17 mg/L, respectively; P = 0.060). After 6 months, only in group A was there a significant decrease in serum cholesterol levels (P = 0.041) and a significant increase in serum albumin levels (P = 0.004). Enzyme levels were stable during the study in both groups.",

The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by these inhibitors was competitive with HMG-CoA and noncompetitive with NADPH.

    "10": "Digoxin-like immunoreactive factors (DLIFs) are endogenous mammalian cardenolides with structural features similar to those of the plant-derived digitalis compounds. DLIFs and their structurally related forms (Dh-DLIFs) may serve as effectors of ion-transport activity mediated by their interaction with Na,K-ATPase and thus play a role as a new hormonal axis. Although some evidence implicates the adrenal gland as a tissue source for the DLIFs, little is known about the biosynthetic pathway producing these compounds. We now demonstrate de novo biosynthesis of DLIF by incorporation of radioactive carbon ((14)C) into the structures of both DLIF and Dh-DLIF.", 
    "11": "We used a combination of reversed-phase HPLC techniques to separate the radioactive DLIF components after incorporation of (14)C into their structure by use of either [1,2-(14)C]acetic acid or [4-(14)C]cholesterol as precursors and a Y-1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line. We also stimulated and suppressed production of steroidogenesis by use of cAMP analogs and Mevastatin, respectively, to demonstrate the dependence of DLIF production on the cholesterol-dependent biosynthetic pathway. A combination of chromatographic mobility, immunoassays specific for digoxin and dihydrodigoxin, and deglycosylation using 5-sulfosalicylic acid were used to identify the DLIF and Dh-DLIF components.", 
    "12": "With cholesterol as precursor, the cells produced DLIF (7.5 mCi/mmol) with a labeling efficiency of 10%, whereas with acetate the cells produced DLIF (72.2 mCi/mmol) with a labeling efficiency of 0.08% of the total DLIF produced. The radiolabeled DLIF and Dh-DLIF molecules had identical chromatographic mobilities and stoichiometric removal of sugars as the previously characterized DLIFs isolated from different mammalian species and tissues. With radioactive cholesterol as precursor, the (14)C was incorporated into the DLIF-genin portion of the compounds and not the sugars. Interestingly, treatment of Y-1 cells with 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-cAMP to stimulate steroidogenesis did not increase production of DLIF or Dh-DLIF but did increase production of progesterone. Mevastatin (5 micromol), an inhibitor of the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and thus of cholesterol biosynthesis, gave an 85% decrease in the production of (14)C-DLIF and progesterone, but only a modest 15% decrease in (14)C-Dh-DLIF production.", 
    "13": "These data demonstrate that the adrenal cell has the cellular machinery necessary for de novo biosynthesis of DLIF and Dh-DLIF starting from a simple carbon pool and also support the concept that cholesterol is a major precursor of the DLIF compounds. This cell culture model provides a source of radiolabeled DLIF compounds for future experimental work.", 
    "14": "Statins reduce coronary and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in middle-aged individuals but their efficacy and safety in elderly people has not been confirmed. Several clinical trials including the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) and Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID), have sub-analysed their results for the 'elderly' cohort, but the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial is the first trial to specifically evaluate the benefits of statin therapy on vascular risk in elderly men and women. The results have shown that pravastatin, given for 3 years, reduced the risk of coronary heart disease in elderly individuals. Within this same time frame, there was no significant benefit on the risk reduction of stroke but there was a trend to reduce the risk of transient ischemic attacks. It was discovered that those patients with the lowest baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol gained the most benefit from the intervention. Drug interactions between pravastatin and the concomitant medications seen in this elderly cohort, was not a significant clinical issue. Therefore, PROSPER extends to elderly individuals the treatment strategy currently used in middle-aged people.", 
    "15": "The use of statins has been associated with substantial reductions in vascular morbidity and mortality. The Prospective Pravastatin Pooling Project (PPP) looked at the long-term safety and efficacy of statins in secondary prevention, based on pooled results from three key statin trials. PPP revealed a highly significant relative risk reduction in total mortality, and demonstrated that pravastatin has a similar incidence of muscle-related side effects as placebo. It has been speculated that treatment with statins in combination with other cardiovascular drugs may have a synergistic effect on reduction of cardiovascular complications. However, for ethical reasons, evidence can only ever be sought from sub-group analyses or meta-analyses of existing studies. Recent studies have focused on statins plus acetyl- salicylic acid (ASA, aspirin). Evidence suggests that a combination of statins with ASA provides a cardiovascular risk reduction that is superior to the respective monotherapy. Thus, statins effectively reduce further cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as total mortality in patients with manifest coronary artery disease (CAD) or at high risk, also they act in synergy with ASA and they are safe.", 
    "16": "While aggressive interventional therapy and anti-thrombotic therapy have revolutionized the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), defined as acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina (UA), long-term event rates remain high. Elevated lipids, inflammation and infection have each been implicated as additional mechanisms contributing to instability of vulnerable plaques. The new frontier in ACS management has focussed on treatment of these components of vascular disease. Preliminary trials have shown that early treatment with statins after ACS reduces coronary events but additional studies are needed to confirm this benefit. Furthermore, it is not clear what degree of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering is needed to stabilize the ACS patient. Chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) but the results of preliminary trials investigating anti-chlamydial antibiotics have been inconsistent. Therefore, the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE-IT TIMI 22) trial has been designed specifically to determine whether standard LDL-C reduction (with pravastatin 40 mg) provides a similar clinical benefit to more aggressive LDL-C reduction (with atorvastatin 80 mg). In 4162 ACS patients over a 2-year period, this trial will also evaluate the long-term effect of the quinolone antibiotic, gatifloxacin, in reducing cardiovascular events.", 
    "17": "The bioequivalence of two formulations of 10 mg tablets of simvastatin (CAS 79902-63-9), Vascor as test and a commercially available preparation as reference, in 18 healthy Thai male volunteers was assessed. In a randomized, single dose, two-period, crossover study design with a 1-week wash-out period, each subject received 4 tablets of 10-mg simvastatin tablets. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period after administration. Subsequently, plasma concentrations of simvastatin and its hydroxy acid metabolite were analyzed by using LC/ MS/MS. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by using non-compartmental analysis. The results showed that 90% confidence intervals of the peak concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of simvastatin and its hydroxy acid metabolite of reference and test were within 80 %-125%. Consequently the bioequivalence of these two preparations can be concluded.", 
    "18": "We have elucidated the interactions of human and rat organic anion transporters (hOATs and rOATs) with pravastatin and cimetidine. Pravastatin inhibited hOAT1/rOAT1, hOAT2/rOAT2, hOAT3/rOAT3, and hOAT4. The mode of inhibition was noncompetitive for hOAT1 and hOAT2, whereas it was competitive for hOAT3 and hOAT4. Cimetidine also inhibited hOAT1/rOAT1, hOAT3/rOAT3, and hOAT4. The mode of inhibition was a combination of competitive and noncompetitive manners for hOAT1, whereas it was competitive for hOAT3. The effects of OAT inhibitors on OAT1, OAT2, and OAT3 exhibited some but not so remarkable interspecies differences between humans and rats. In conclusion, we have characterized pravastatin and cimetidine as OAT inhibitors.", 
    "19": "Statins, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, are effective serum cholesterol-lowering agents in clinical practice, and they may also have anti-inflammatory properties. Asthma is characterized by chronic eosinophilic inflammation in the airways, which is thought to be regulated by the activity of T lymphocytes. We therefore examined the anti-inflammatory activity of simvastatin in a murine model of allergic asthma. In mice previously sensitized to OVA, simvastatin treatment, either orally or i.p., reduced the total inflammatory cell infiltrate and eosinophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in response to inhaled OVA challenge. Simvastatin therapy i.p. was also associated with a reduction in IL-4 and IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and, at higher doses, a histological reduction in inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs. OVA-induced IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IFN-gamma secretion was reduced in thoracic lymph node cultures from simvastatin-treated mice. Simvastatin treatment did not alter serum total IgE or OVA-specific IgG1 and IgG2a levels. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of statin-sensitive pathways in allergic airways disease.", 
    "20": "Alzheimer disease is not a single disorder. Etiologically, two different types or even diseases exist: inheritance in 5% to 10% of all Alzheimer cases versus 90% to 95% AD cases whith sporadic origin (SAD). Different susceptibility genes along with adult lifestyle risk-factors- in the case of SAD the risk factor aging- may be assumed to cause the latter disorder. There is evidence that a disturbance in the insulin signal transduction pathway may be a central and early pathophysiologic event in SAD. Both, hypercortisolemia and increased adrenergic activity, in both old age and SAD may render the function of the neuronal insulin receptor vulnerable resulting in a diminished production of ATP. The reduced availability of ATP may damage the function of the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus/trans Golgi network generating misfolded and malfolded proteins retained in the cell. In SAD, amyloid precursor protein is found to accumulate intracellularly thus not representing the cause but a driving force in the pathogenesis of SAD. Additionally, both disturbed insulin signaling and reduced ATP forward the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein. Thus, abnormalities in oxidative brain metabolism lead to the formation of two main morphologic hallmarks of SAD: senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Therefore, the therapeutic goal in SAD should be the improvement of the neuronal energy state. Findings from both basic and clinical studies showed that Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) may be appropiate to approach that goal.",

The mean (SD) duration of diagnosed diabetes at first vitreous haemorrhage was significantly longer, 21.9 (7.6) years for type I and 14.8 (9.3) years for type II diabetic patients (P < 0.01, unpaired t-test, two-tailed).Aspirin administration was not associated with a significantly later onset of vitreous haemorrhage. Four episodes were associated with ACE-inhibitor cough. There was a trend towards HMGCoA reductase inhibitor (statin) use being associated with a delayed onset of vitreous haemorrhage: 21.4 years until vitreous haemorrhage (treatment group) vs 16.2 years (nontreatment group) (P = 0.09, two-tailed, unpaired t-test, not statistically significant). During follow-up 56 recurrences occurred, making a total of 110 episodes of vitreous haemorrhage in 79 eyes of 54 patients. The mean (range) follow-up post haemorrhage was 1067 (77-3842) days, with an average of 1.02 recurrences. Age, gender, diabetes type (I or II) or control, presence of hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia, and macrovascular complications were not associated with a significant effect on the 1-year recurrence rate. Aspirin (and other antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents) and ACE- inhibitors appeared to neither increase nor decrease the 1-year recurrence rate. However, statin use was significantly associated with a reduction in recurrence (Fisher exact P < 0.05; two-tailed) with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 0.25 (0.1-0.95).", 
    "24": "In this retrospective analysis, the onset of preretinal/vitreous haemorrhage was not found to be accelerated by gender, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, evidence of macrovascular disease, or HbA1c. Neither aspirin nor ACE-inhibitor administration accelerated the onset or recurrence of first vitreous haemorrhage. Statins may have a protective role, both delaying and reducing the recurrence of haemorrhage.",

    "31": "Inflammatory processes, aside from cholesterol, play a central role in atherogenesis. Human C-reactive protein (huCRP) signals systemic inflammation and independently predicts future cardiovascular risk. Cholesterol-lowering statins reduce atherosclerosis and plasma huCRP levels. Evidence is sought for a direct anti-inflammatory statin effect in vivo, independent of effects on plasma cholesterol and atherogenesis. The effect of atorvastatin and simvastatin on huCRP expression was studied in nonatherosclerotic huCRP transgenic mice and compared with another class of hypolipidemic drugs, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha) activators, notably fenofibrate and Wy14643. Like statins, PPARalpha activators combine antiatherosclerotic properties with huCRP-lowering effects. Dietary treatment with statins or PPARalpha activators decreased basal and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-induced plasma huCRP levels independently of cholesterol lowering. These direct anti-inflammatory in vivo effects occurred at the transcriptional level and could be confirmed in cultured human liver slices and in human hepatoma cells transiently transfected with a huCRP promoter-driven luciferase reporter. A molecular rationale for the suppression of IL-1-induced huCRP transcription is provided by showing that statins and PPARalpha activators up-regulate IkappaBalpha protein expression. This results in a reduced nuclear translocation of p50-nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) and thereby decreased amounts of nuclear p50-NFkappaB approximately CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) complexes, which determine the huCRP transcription rate. Our results provide conclusive evidence for a direct suppressive effect of statins and PPARalpha activators on huCRP expression independent of cholesterol lowering and atherogenesis.", 
    "32": "Cell migration is a key event in repair and remodeling of skeletal tissues, but the mechanism of osteoblast migration has not been resolved. Statins, which are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, increase bone. However, the effect of statins on osteoblast migration remains to be clarified. We investigated the effect of fluvastatin and mevastatin on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced migration of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. PDGF promoted osteoblast migration, while the statins inhibited PDGF-induced migration, and mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate but not farnesylpyrophosphate abolished the effect of statins. Dominant-negative Rac severely inhibited PDGF-induced osteoblast migration and reduced Akt phosphorylation. Further, fluvastatin reduced Akt phosphorylation and dominant-negative Akt inhibited PDGF-induced osteoblast migration. These results demonstrate that statins inhibit PDGF-induced osteoblast migration and Rac-Akt signaling plays an important role in the osteoblast migration, and suggest that statins restrain Rac function by inhibiting geranylgeranylation of Rac, which leads to the reduction in Akt activation and osteoblast migration.",

Many years of research and observations proved a particular meaning of cytokines and acute phase proteins in the pathophysiology of CHF. These markers are responsible for the repairing processes. There is a correlation between the activity of inflammatory factors, their plasma concentrations and clinical state of the patient. Basing on the cytokine's concentrations, the level of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) in the patient's blood and their changes in time we can predict the progression of the disease. Known medical references emphasise the fact that the pharmacological modification of inflammatory markers (interleukins, TNF-alfa, CRP) can have significant clinical consequences and in some cases can even cause regression of pathological symptoms. CRP plays an important role in the development and progression CHF and can be the clinical predictor not only in the cases of coronary disease but also can be useful in the group of patients with CHF. The introduction of drugs influencing CRP, interleukins and TNF-alfa levels to CHF therapy can be an effective solution called 'a golden therapy' improving clinical state and quality of patient's life.", 
    "43": "In vitro treatment with a pharmacological dose of simvastatin, a potent pro-drug of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, stimulates bone formation. In our study, simvastatin stimulated differentiation of osteoblasts remarkably in a dose-dependent manner, with minimal effect on proliferation. To identify the mediators of the anabolic effects of simvastatin on osteoblasts, we tried to identify and characterize simvastatin-induced proteins by using proteomic analysis. Calcyclin was significantly up-regulated by more than 10 times, and annexin I was also up-regulated by simvastatin. However, annexin III, vimentin, and tropomyosin were down-regulated. Up-regulated calcyclin mRNA by simvastatin was validated by reverse transcription in mouse calvarial cells. In confocal microscope analysis, green fluorescence protein-calcyclin fusion protein was ubiquitously observed in the of MC3T3-E1 cells transfected with green fluorescence protein-calcyclin cDNA containing plasmid and was quickly concentrated in the nucleus 20 min after simvastatin treatment. Overexpression of calcyclin cDNA stimulated both the proliferation and expression of alkaline phosphatase mRNA significantly, without exposure to simvastatin in MC3T3-E1 cells. However, both the rate of proliferation of the osteoblasts and the expression of alkaline phosphatase mRNA were suppressed significantly 1 day after treatment with the calcyclin-specific small interference RNA, and furthermore, simvastatin did not overcome this suppression in the small interference RNA-pretreated MC3T3-E1 cells. In conclusion, calcyclin is one of the candidate proteins that plays a role in osteoblastogenesis in response to simvastatin, although the precise functions of calcyclin in osteoblast remain to be verified.",

Scavenger receptor-mediated accumulation of oxidized LDL (OxLDL)-derived cholesteryl ester is considered to be a critical step in the development of atherosclerotic foam cell formation. We studied the effect of pitavastatin on CD36 (a class B scavenger receptor) expression by murine macrophages.", 
    "46": "Treatment of J774 cells and murine peritoneal macrophages with pitavastatin decreased CD36 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. Decreased CD36 mRNA was associated with decreased CD36 cell surface protein expression in human THP-1 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Pitavastatin also reduced the increase in CD36 mRNA, cell surface protein, and binding/uptake of OxLDL induced by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) ligands and/or OxLDL. Pitavastatin did not alter the half-life of CD36 mRNA, which suggests pitavastatin downregulates CD36 expression by reducing CD36 transcription. In addition, pitavastatin significantly decreased PPARgamma mRNA and protein expression. Finally, pitavastatin increased p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and PPARgamma phosphorylation and increased the ratio of phosphorylated PPARgamma to nonphosphorylated PPARgamma.",

    "48": "Since the rat is an atherosclerosis-resistant species, the study of atherosclerosis using rats is limited. The present study was undertaken to develop an atherosclerotic model in rats, to investigate the effect of nitric oxide (NO) inactivation and hyperlipidemia, and to evaluate the effect of pitavastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibitor, on NO inactivation and on hyperlipidemia-induced changes in the cardiovascular system. Four-month-old male spontaneously hypertensive hyperlipidemic rats (SHHR) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used to study 1) the effect of the period of treatment with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 mg/L) on high fat diet (HFD)-treated SHHR and SD rats, and 2) the effect of pitavastatin (Pit, 0.3 mg/kg/day) on the changes in the aorta of L-NAME- and HFD-treated SHHR and SD rats. L-NAME administration for 1 month then HFD feeding for 2 months markedly increased the deposition of lipids and the thickness of the endothelium in SHHR. Continuous L-NAME treatment with HFD produced severe injury and stripped of endothelium in both strains. The plasma total cholesterol of L-NAME + HFD-treated and L-NAME + HFD + Pit-treated SHHR was significantly higher than that of control SHHR. Lipid deposition, however, was comparatively less in the aorta of L-NAME + HFD + Pit-treated SHHR. The concentration of cholesterol in the aorta of control SHHR was significantly lower than that in the aorta of L-NAME + HFD-treated SHHR, whereas that of L-NAME + HFD + Pit-treated SHHR was the same as that in control SHHR. These data indicated that Pit blocked lipid deposition in the aorta of L-NAME + HFD treated SHHR without changing plasma lipid profiles. In conclusion, NO inactivation and HFD induce lipid deposition in the endothelium, and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor blocks the deposition in SHHR.", 
    "49": "The effect of simvastatin therapy on the biologic characteristics of the electronegative low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfraction of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) was studied. Total LDL, isolated from FH plasma at 0, 3 and 6 months of simvastatin treatment, was subfractionated into electropositive LDL (LDL[+]) and electronegative LDL (LDL[-]) by anion exchange chromatography. LDL isolated from healthy normolipemic (NL) subjects was used as a control. The LDL(-) proportion was twofold higher in patients with FH than in NL subjects (17.6 +/- 1.6% vs 7.8 +/- 1.5%, respectively; p <0.05) and was progressively reduced by simvastatin therapy (15.7 +/- 1.6% at 3 months; 13.8 +/- 2.5% at 6 months; p <0.05). Both LDL subfractions from patients with FH had a higher relative cholesterol content and decreased apolipoprotein B and triglycerides than NL subfractions. Simvastatin progressively induced changes in lipid content of both LDL subfractions in patients with FH, and lipid composition was closer to these subfractions in NL subjects after 6 months of therapy. Binding displacement experiments in human fibroblasts demonstrated that LDL(-) from both groups of subjects had a lower affinity of binding to the LDL receptor that LDL(+). In addition, LDL(+) in patients with FH presented an intermediate binding affinity between LDL(-) and LDL(+) in NL subjects. Simvastatin-induced changes in LDL composition were accompanied by a progressive increase in affinity of LDL(+) and LDL(-) in patients with FH. After 6 months of therapy, LDL(+) in FH had an affinity similar to that of LDL(+) in NL subjects. The LDL(-)-induced release of chemokines interleukin-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 from cultured endothelial cells was twofold higher compared with that of LDL(+). No difference in chemokine release between patients with FH and NL subjects or the effect of simvastatin were observed. We conclude that simvastatin therapy was able to modify LDL subfraction composition in subjects with FH and increase their affinity to the LDL receptor. This improvement could contribute to the observed reduction in LDL(-) proportion induced by simvastatin.",

These studies clarify the probable initial cause of the acute phase response to N-BP drugs and suggest a possible way of preventing this phenomenon.", 
    "55": "The acute phase response is the major adverse effect of intravenously administered nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate drugs (N-BPs), used in the treatment of metabolic bone diseases. This effect has recently been attributed to their action as non-peptide antigens and direct stimulation of gamma,delta-T-cells. However, because N-BPs are potent inhibitors of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase, they could cause indirect activation of gamma,delta-T-cells owing to the accumulation of intermediates upstream of FPP synthase in the mevalonate pathway, such as isopentenyl diphosphate/dimethylallyl diphosphate, which are known gamma,delta-T-cell agonists.",

    "57": "The ability of N-BPs to stimulate proliferation of CD3+ gamma,delta-T-cells in human PBMC cultures matched the ability to inhibit FPP synthase. Gamma,delta-T-cell proliferation and activation (interferon gamma [IFNgamma] and TNFalpha release) was prevented by mevastatin or lovastatin, which inhibit HMG-CoA reductase upstream of FPP synthase and prevent the synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate/dimethylallyl diphosphate. Desoxolovastatin, an analog of lovastatin incapable of inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, did not overcome the stimulatory effect of N-BP. Furthermore, statins did not prevent the activation of gamma,delta-T-cells by a synthetic gamma,delta-T-cell agonist or by anti-CD3 antibody. Together, these observations show that N-BPs indirectly stimulate the proliferation and activation of gamma,delta-T-cells caused by inhibition of FPP synthase and intracellular accumulation of isopentenyl diphosphate/ dimethylallyl diphosphate in PBMCs. Because activation of gamma,delta-T-cells could be the initiating event in the acute phase response to bisphosphonate therapy, co-administration of a statin could be an effective approach to prevent this adverse effect.",

    "66": "Large-scale intervention trials demonstrate that treatment with statins, the most effective lipid lowering drug class, significantly reduces the risk of coronary heart disease events. Recent evidence suggests that more aggressive LDL cholesterol lowering with newly developed statins may provide greater clinical benefit, even in individuals with moderately elevated serum cholesterol levels. There is increasing evidence that statins exert a myriad of other beneficial pleiotropic effects on the vascular wall, thus altering the course of atherosclerotic disease. In the long-term treatment, non-life-threatening side effects may occur in up to 15% of patients receiving one statin. Significant elevations in the activity of serum aminotransferase and creatine kinase alone or in combination with muscle pain in statin-treated patients should be taken seriously. The combination of the statins with gemfibrozil results in higher rates of drug toxicity. Reports show possible adverse effects of statins on nervous system function including mood alterations, however, statins have also been associated with improvement in central nervous system disorders. Special attention must be paid to the tolerability of the statins in children, elderly and transplant patients. Future clinical studies and surveillance information will warrant long term safety of each member of this class of lipid-lowering agents. New classes of patients with diabetes, metabolic syndrome and renal diseases may have clinical benefits from statins. New upcoming clinical trials will address the fundamental question of whether statin treatment can protect from the natural history of atherosclerotic-related diseases. This will require a more prolonged follow-up (i.e., 10 to 15 years). Finally, the basic understanding of newer pathogenic mechanisms involving the effects of statins on angiogenesis and the nitric oxide pathway should be explored in the clinical setting as well as the study of pathogenic mechanisms by which statins can affect plaque instability.", 
    "67": "Recent trials provide a wealth of data documenting the benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy with statins in both primary and secondary prevention. A growing body of evidence indicates that statins possess pleiotropic effects - independent of, or at least in addition to their lipid-lowering capacity, including inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and subsequently neointimal proliferation, platelet aggregation as well as antiinflammatory and direct beneficial effects on endothelial function. The current review summarizes recent findings in non-randomized and randomized trials assessing the efficacy of statin therapy following coronary interventions with or without stent implantation. It highlights the efficacy of statins in the settings of acute coronary syndromes. Current management of acute coronary syndromes requires early administration in combination with acute interventions. High risk patients which receive the greatest benefit could be identified by measuring serum markers such as preprocedural C-reactive protein levels. The present article also describes important novel actions of statins supporting the early initiation of statins post intervention, such as the stimulation of reendothelialization - a crucial step in the healing process of the vascular wall - which is mediated at least in part by mobilization of bone-marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells.", 
    "68": "The higher an individual patient's risk, the greater the clinical effect of lipid lowering drug therapy. According to present guidelines, therapeutic decisions should be guided by the patient's overall risk. This depends not only on the LDL cholesterol, but also on the number and degree of other risk factors. This paper will show that LDL cholesterol before treatment determines the clinical efficacy of a statin: for instance, using a statin to lower the LDL cholesterol by one third gives a greater risk reduction the higher the baseline value. For a given baseline value, greater risk reduction results from a larger reduction in LDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol measurement is thus essential before and on treatment.",

Therefore, statins play a major part in the pharmacological treatment of cardiovascular disease. Even before it became apparent that statins are effective despite normal baseline lipid levels, it was known that statins exert additional effects on the vascular wall that are independent of lipid lowering and protective toward the arteriosclerotic plaque. Some of these pleiotropic effects are related to hemostasis: through profibrinolytic, antiadhesive and antiaggregatory mechanisms, statins act antithrombotic. Based on experimental results, concerns were brought forward Simthat atorvastatin interferes with the antithrombotic effects of the ADP-receptor inhibitor prodrug, clopidogrel, due to competitive affinity to liver enzymes. So far, however, other experimental as well as clinical data do not support the hypothesis that atorvastatin or any other statin affects the antithrombotic potency of clopidogrel. The aforementioned issues will be discussed.", 
    "73": "Aging is associated with a rise in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a loss of telomerase reverse transcriptase activity. Incubation with H2O2 induced the nuclear export of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) into the cytosol in a Src-family kinase-dependent manner. Therefore, we investigated the hypothesis that age-related increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) may induce the nuclear export of TERT and contribute to endothelial cell senescence. Continuous cultivation of endothelial cells resulted in an increased endogenous formation of ROS starting after 29 population doublings (PDL). This increase was accompanied by mitochondrial DNA damage and preceded the onset of replicative senescence at PDL 37. Along with the enhanced formation of ROS, we detected an export of nuclear TERT protein from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and an activation of the Src-kinase. Moreover, the induction of premature senescence by low concentrations of H2O2 was completely blocked with the Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2, suggesting a crucial role for Src-family kinases in the induction of endothelial cell aging. Incubation with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, from PDL 26, reduced the intracellular ROS formation and prevented mitochondrial DNA damage. Likewise, nuclear export of TERT protein, loss in the overall TERT activity, and the onset of replicative senescence were delayed by incubation with N-acetylcysteine. Low doses of the statin, atorvastatin (0.1 micromol/L), had also effects similar to those of N-acetylcysteine. We conclude that both antioxidants and statins can delay the onset of replicative senescence by counteracting the increased ROS production linked to aging of endothelial cells.",

In Drosophila, reduced HMGCoAR activity results in germ cell migration defects. We show that pharmacological HMGCoAR inhibition alters zebrafish development and germ cell migration. Embryos treated with atorvastatin (Lipitor) exhibited germ cell migration defects and mild morphologic abnormalities. The effects induced by atorvastatin were completely rescued by prior injection of mevalonate, the product of HMGCoAR activity, or the prenylation precursors farnesol and geranylgeraniol. In contrast, squalene, a cholesterol intermediate further down the pathway, failed to rescue statin-induced defects. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase 1 (GGT1) protein prenylation activity also resulted in abnormal germ cell migration. Thus, our pharmacological inhibition-and-rescue approach provided detailed information about the elements of isoprenoid biosynthesis that contribute to germ cell migration. Together with data from Drosophila (Santos and Lehmann, this issue), our results highlight a conserved role for protein geranylgeranylation in this context.",

Fluvastatin systemic exposure was 50% less when administered as Lescol XL 80 mg qd compared with Lescol IR 40 mg bid. Conversely, fluvastatin systemic exposure was 22% higher when administered as Lescol XL 160 mg qd compared with Lescol IR 40 mg bid. Single doses of Lescol XL 80 mg and 160 mg were dose proportional but, deviation (30%) from dose proportionality was observed for the Lescol XL 160 mg at steady-state. There appeared to be moderate (20%-40%) accumulation of serum fluvastatin maximal concentrations and exposure after multiple doses of Lescol XL tablets. Both Lescol XL 80 mg and 160 mg showed delayed absorption and longer apparent elimination half-life compared with fluvastatin IR capsule. Single and multiple doses of fluvastatin were generally well tolerated in this healthy volunteer population. Adverse event profiles were consistent with the published safety profile of the marketed formulations.

To understand the contribution of HMGR to plant development, we isolated T-DNA insertion mutants for HMG1 and HMG2. The hmg1 and hmg2 mutants were both more sensitive than the wild type (WT) to lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMGR. The hmg2 mutant showed no visible phenotype under normal growth conditions. In contrast, the hmg1 mutant exhibited dwarfing, early senescence, and sterility. Expression of senescence-associated genes 12 (SAG12), a marker gene for senescence, was induced in the hmg1 mutant at an earlier stage than in the WT. Levels of trans-cytokinins--hormones known to inhibit senescence--were not lower in hmg1. The mutant did not have the typical appearance of brassinosteroid (BR)-deficient mutants, except for a dwarf phenotype, because of the suppression of cell elongation. The expression of several genes involved in cell elongation was suppressed in hmg1. WT plants treated exogenously with inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis had similar gene expression and sterility characteristics as the hmg1 mutants. Pleiotropic phenotypes were rescued by feeding with squalene, the precursor of sterols and triterpenoids. The sterol levels in hmg1 mutants were lower than in the WT. These findings suggest that HMG1 plays a critical role in triterpene biosynthesis, and that sterols and/or triterpenoids contribute to cell elongation, senescence, and fertility.",

We determined the percentage of patients who had a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) documented in their chart and the percentage of patients who received LDL screening within the past year. We then stratified the sample into three different categories of LDL level (< 100 mg/dl, 100-129 mg/dl, and > or = 130 mg/dl) and determined the percentage of patients who were on lipid-lowering therapy within each stratum.",

Lipid control rates are somewhat better than the rates reported in previous studies, but they are still not optimal. While many of the patients requiring lipid-lowering therapy are on these medications, a substantial minority has an LDL of < 100 mg/dl without being on medications. Although these findings may reflect patient preference to defer medications, it suggests that there is room for improvement with medical therapy.", 
    "100": "A substantial number of physicians in Asian countries believe that Asian patients need lower doses of statins to achieve therapeutic lipid target because of the smaller size of patients. This belief is deep rooted and we looked at the SGH Lipid Clinic to determine if our experience bears out this belief. Between 1996 and August 2000, the Lipid Unit treated a total of 841 patients, of which 548 patients (77.5% Chinese, 12.1% Malays, 7.6% Asian Indians; 49.6% males, 50.4% females; 54.7% diabetics, 45.3% non-diabetic) were on statins alone. These patients had > or =2 coronary risk factors, diabetes mellitus or documented coronary heart disease. The pre-treatment lipid levels or the worst lipid levels available were entered as the baseline lipid values (mean LDL-C: 5.38+1.5 mmol/l). Duration of therapy ranged from six months to five years. The choice and titration of statins were determined by attending physicians. The median statin dose (Simvastatin equivalent) was 20.0 mg with 52.5% requiring 20 mg or more. Statin dose did not differ between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The median statin dose was 15 mg for the lower two tertiles and 20 mg for the upper tertile; this difference did not achieve statistical significance. The reduction in LDL cholesterol was 41.5% (40.1-42.8) and total cholesterol was 33.0% (32.9-34.1). Only 25% of our patients achieved LDL cholesterol of less than 2.6 mmol/l whilst 77.5% had LDL cholesterol less than 3.4 mmol/l. Our experience at the Lipid Clinic suggests that the Asian patients require similar statin doses to achieve target cholesterol levels.", 
    "101": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can be used to induce experimental endotoxic shock, which is characterized by a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and a decreased vasoconstrictor response that have been attributed to excessive nitric oxide production. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), in addition to lowering serum cholesterol levels, exert many pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory action. In the present study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on the production of nitric oxide and the cardiovascular response to LPS. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with different doses of simvastatin (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline 20 min before i.v. injection of LPS (1.5 mg/kg) or saline (control). MAP was continuously recorded and nitrate plasma concentration was determined during the 6-h experimental session at 1-h intervals. The pressor response to phenylephrine (1 microg/kg) was evaluated before and 6 h after LPS administration. In the LPS-treated group, there was a time-dependent increase in nitrate plasma concentration (P<0.001), and this response was decreased in simvastatin pretreated rats (P<0.001). We also observed that LPS decreased the pressor response to phenylephrine (P<0.001), an effect that was reverted by simvastatin pretreatment (P<0.05). However, simvastatin did not modify the decrease of MAP induced by LPS. We concluded that simvastatin decreases nitrate plasma concentration in response to LPS and recovers vascular responsiveness during an experimental endotoxic shock. These data suggest the potential use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors as a coadjuvant in the treatment of septic shock.",

After a 3-week placebo run-in, 37 patients were randomized to receive placebo (n=7) or ezetimibe 10 mg/d (n=30) for 8 weeks. Sitosterol concentrations decreased by 21% (P<0.001) in patients treated with ezetimibe compared with a nonsignificant 4% rise in those on placebo (between-group P<0.001). The reduction in sitosterol from baseline was progressive, with further decline observed at each subsequent biweekly visit. Campesterol also progressively declined, with a mean decrease after 8 weeks of 24% with ezetimibe and a mean increase of 3% with placebo treatment (between-group P<0.001). Reductions in plant sterol concentrations were similar irrespective of whether patients were undergoing concomitant treatment with resin or statin. Reductions in total sterols and apolipoprotein B were also observed. Ezetimibe was well tolerated, with no serious treatment-related adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events being reported.",

Men and women showed a comparable benefit from statin treatment, elderly patients a little more than younger patients. 4. The statins did not have like effects. There were clear differences in potency as well as in the interval between initiation of treatment and the onset of clinical benefit. 5. Estimating 5 years of treatment, cardiac morbidity decreased with atorvastatin up to 44 %, with pravastatin up to 36 %, with fluva- or simvastatin up to 32 % and with lovastatin up to 24 %, approximately. 6. Estimating 5 years of treatment, morbidity of suffering from stroke decreased with atorvastatin up to 41 %, with simvastatin up to 34 % and with pravastatin up to 31 %, approximately. For fluva- and lovastatin there are no comparable data. Within the first 16 weeks of treatment following an acute coronary syndrome relative risk for suffering a non-lethal stroke was reduced with atorvastatin 80 mg/day up to 59 % compared to placebo, the relative risk for stroke up to 50 %. 7. The fastest onset of clinical benefit - reduction of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, hospitalization and necessity of invasive interventions - was demonstrated by treatment with atorvastatin (rapid, within some weeks), followed by lovastatin (after one year), fluva-, prava- and simvastatin (after 11/2 - 2 years). 8. These results were achieved with atorvastatin 10 mg/day (80 mg/day used in MIRACL), lovastatin 20 to 40 mg/day (caused by dosage titration), pravastatin 40 mg/day, simvastatin 20 to 80 mg/day (caused by dosage titration) or fluvastatin 80 mg/day. 9. The advantage of atorvastatin may be due to its ability to reduce cardiovascular disease by stopping the growth of plaques in artery walls. 10.

Previous reports applying an 8-h exposure of U18666A, a cholesterol transport-inhibiting agent, demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in beta-amyloid (Abeta) deposition and secretion in cortical neurons, with no significant cell injury. In the current study, we examined the chronic effect of 24-72h of U18666A treatment on primary cortical neurons and several cell lines. Our results showed caspase-3 activation and cellular injury in U18666A-treated cortical neurons but not in the cell lines, suggesting cell death by apoptosis only occurred in cortical neurons after chronic exposure to U18666A. We also demonstrated through filipin staining the accumulation of intracellular cholesterol in cortical neurons treated with U18666A, indicating the phenotypic mimic of NPC by U18666A. However, additions of 10 and 25microM pravastatin with 0.5microg/ml U18666A significantly attenuated toxicity. Taken together, these data showed for the first time that U18666A induces cell death by apoptosis and suggested an important in vitro model system to study NPC.", 
    "111": "There is a large body of evidence demonstrating an inverse correlation between circulating levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk. For every 1-mg/dL increase in HDL, it is estimated that the risk of cardiovascular events decreases by 2% to 3%. HDL is one of many factors that contribute to the regulation of the atherosclerotic process. HDL mediates reverse cholesterol transport and exhibits numerous beneficial properties, including antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and antithrombotic effects on the vasculature. Recent studies have expanded our understanding of the vasoprotective mechanisms of HDL to include enhanced nitric oxide production and improved endothelium-dependent relaxation. Progress has also been made in determining the molecular mechanisms that mediate reverse cholesterol transport. Recently published National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines have broadened the definition of low levels of HDL and encourage more aggressive screening and treatment of lipid abnormalities. Several therapeutic interventions can augment HDL concentrations, and there is increasing evidence that these interventions improve cardiovascular outcomes. Research focusing on defining the molecular roles of HDL will likely identify potential therapeutic targets for decreasing the incidence and progression of coronary heart disease. This review highlights the role of HDL in coronary heart disease, from basic mechanisms of action to recent clinical trial results.",

The flow- mediated dilation (FMD; endothelium dependent) and nitroglycerin-induced dilation (endothelium independent) in the brachial artery and the vascular reactivity at the forearm skin were measured. FMD improved in the atorvastatin-treated, at-risk subjects [median (25-75 percentile), 7.2% (2.9-9.6%) at exit visit vs. 6.6% (2.9-9.5%) at baseline; P < 0.05]. A similar improvement of FMD was found in atorvastatin-treated diabetic patients [median (25-75 percentile), 5.6 (3.9-7.9) at exit visit vs. 4.2 (3.2-7.2) at baseline; P = 0.07]. No changes were observed in nitroglycerin-induced dilation and the microcirculation reactivity measurements in either group.

    "117": "Although an immense knowledge has accumulated concerning regulation of cholesterol homeostasis in the body, this does not include the brain, where details are just emerging. Approximately 25% of the total amount of the cholesterol present in humans is localized to this organ, most of it present in myelin. Almost all brain cholesterol is a product of local synthesis, with the blood-brain barrier efficiently protecting it from exchange with lipoprotein cholesterol in the circulation. Thus, there is a highly efficient apolipoprotein-dependent recycling of cholesterol in the brain, with minimal losses to the circulation. Under steady-state conditions, most of the de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the brain appears to be balanced by excretion of the cytochrome P-450-generated oxysterol 24S-hydroxycholesterol. This oxysterol is capable of escaping the recycling mechanism and traversing the blood-brain barrier. Cholesterol levels and cholesterol turnover are affected in neurodegenerating disorders, and the capacity for cholesterol transport and recycling in the brain seems to be of importance for the development of such diseases. The possibility has been discussed that administration of inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis may reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer disease. No firm conclusions can, however, be drawn from the studies presented thus far. In the present review, the most recent advances in our understanding of cholesterol turnover in the brain is discussed.",

We studied in rat mesangial cells whether the antiproliferative action of cerivastatin on mesangial cells may be mediated by mesangial nitric oxide (NO) formation due to the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) or by induction of cyclooxygenase-2. Mesangial cells were stimulated with interleukin-1 beta and treated with cerivastatin for 24 h. Cell proliferation was examined by bromodeoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation, and nitrite and prostaglandin production was measured in supernatants as a means for iNOS or cyclooxygenase-2 activity. iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 expression was quantified by Northern and Western blot analyses. Cerivastatin (0.0625 microM) significantly inhibited DNA synthesis in interleukin-1 beta-stimulated mesangial cells without altering cell viability. Interleukin-1 beta-induced nitrite production was twofold increased by 0.05 microM cerivastatin, and this effect could be reversed by addition of 100 microM mevalonate. iNOS mRNA levels increased sixfold (33% of maximum) in cerivastatin-treated mesangial cells as compared with vehicle-treated controls (3.5% of maximum). iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression increased threefold (iNOS: 2.77+/-0.53/cyclooxygenase-2: 3.49+/-1.25). The NOS inhibitors N-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine (L-NIL) reversed the antiproliferative effect of cerivastatin. The cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor celecoxib did not alter DNA synthesis and iNOS or cyclooxygenase-2 expression, but blocked prostacyclin production in interleukin-1 beta and cerivastatin-treated mesangial cells. In conclusion, cerivastatin increased cytokine-induced iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 expression, thus constituting NO-regulated growth inhibition of mesangial cells.", 
    "127": "D-003 is a mixture of long-chain aliphatic primary acids isolated from sugar cane wax with cholesterol-lowering effects proven in animals and healthy human volunteers. D-003 reduced serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in rabbits, while it increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and did not affect triglycerides. D-003 inhibits cholesterol synthesis by regulating, instead of directly inhibiting, hydroxamethylglutaryl-CoA (HMGCoA) reductase activity. Although the ways in which D-003 and statins inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis are not identical, the strong competitive inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis induced by statins suggests that an enhanced decrease of LDL-C and TC caused by the combined therapy D-003 plus statins is not expected. Nevertheless, taking into account the differential effects of D-003 and statins in HDL-C and triglycerides in rabbits, potential benefits of such combined therapy on other lipid variables cannot been discarded. Fluvastatin is a statin that inhibits competitively HMGCoA reductase, like other members of this class. This study was undertaken to compare the cholesterol-lowering effects of D-003, fluvastatin and the combined therapy of D-003 plus fluvastatin in normocholesterolemic rabbits. Animals were randomly distributed into four groups of eight. One control group received the vehicle, two groups were treated with D-003 or fluvastatin at 5 mg/kg/day each, and the fourth group received the combined therapy of both drugs at 5 mg/kg/day each. Treatments were orally administered for 30 days. Body weight, food consumption and overall animal behavior were recorded to detect any warning sign resulting from combined therapy. After treatment, it was found that both D-003 and fluvastatin had significantly lowered LDL-C - D-003 by 81.5% (p < 0.01) and fluvastatin by 61.4% (p < 0.05). Combined therapy reduced LDL-C values (75.9%). Final values and percent changes reached in all groups were different from the control (p < 0.01). The reductions of TC were consistent with LDL-C decreases, so that D-003, fluvastatin and combined therapy significantly lowered TC by 48.4% (p < 0.01), 39.7% (p < 0.05) and 45.3%, respectively, values being different from those of the control (p < 0.01). The responses of LDL-C and TC to combined therapy were statistically similar, but less pronounced than those reached by D-003 alone. D-003 and combined therapy, but not fluvastatin alone, increased HDL-C (+21.5% and + 19.0%, respectively), these changes being significant versus the control (p < 0.05). In turn, fluvastatin and combined therapy, but not D-003 alone, lowered triglycerides (13.6% and 13.0%, respectively, p < 0.05 versus control). The effects of combined therapy on HDL-C were similar to those of D-003 alone, and the effects of combined therapy on triglycerides were similar to those of fluvastatin alone. The only advantage of combined therapy appears to be that it shows better effects on HDL-C than those of fluvastatin alone and better effects on triglycerides than D-003 alone. No significant changes in lipid profile were observed in the control group. All groups showed similar food consumption and body weight gain, health status being unaffected by the treatments. It is concluded that D-003 and fluvastatin at 5 mg/kg/day administered orally for 30 days to normocholesterolemic rabbits lowered LDL-C and TC, D-003 being more effective in increasing HDL-C and fluvastatin in lowering triglycerides. Combined therapy did not improve the response of LDL-C and TC with respect to monotherapies, but induced better responses of HDL-C and triglycerides than fluvastatin alone had on HDL-C or D-003 alone had on triglycerides.",

The study was performed on 25 subjects (12 men and 12 women) aged 33-67 yo, with hypercholesterolemia, which have received simvastatin, 10 mg daily for 8 months. Under treatment with simvastatin we obtained a significant decrease of total cholesterol (p < 0.0001) and an improvement of enzymatic antioxidant parameters: superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT). In conclusion, simvastatin therapy determines a significant decrease in SOD, GPx, CAT, and an increase in CAT/SOD and GPx/SOD ratios.",

How safe and well-tolerated is this combination? One hundred sixty patients with CAD, including 25 with diabetes mellitus, with mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 128 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol of < or =35 mg/dl (mean 31), and mean triglycerides of 217 mg/dl were randomized to 4 factorial combinations of antioxidant vitamins or their placebos and simvastatin plus niacin or their placebos.

Aspartate aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase (CPK), uric acid, homocysteine, and fasting glucose levels were regularly monitored. A safety monitor reviewed all side effects and adjusted drug dosages accordingly. Patients who received simvastatin plus niacin and those on placebo had similar frequencies of clinical or laboratory side effects: any degree of flushing (30% vs 23%, p = NS), symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and/or muscle aches (9% vs 5%, p = NS), aspartate aminotransferase (SGOT) > or =3 times upper limit of normal (3% vs 1%, p = NS), CPK > or =2 times upper limit of normal (3% vs 4%, p = NS), CPK > or =5 times upper limit of normal, new onset of uric acid > or =7.5 mg/dl (18% vs 15%, p = NS), and homocysteine > or =15 micromol/L (9% vs 4%, p = NS). Glycemic control among diabetics declined mildly in the simvastatin-niacin group but returned to pretreatment levels at 8 months and remained stable for rest of the study. This combination regimen was repeatedly described by 91% of treated patients and 86% of placebo subjects as \"very easy\" or \"fairly easy\" to take. Thus, the simvastatin plus niacin regimen is effective, safe, and well tolerated in patients with or without diabetes mellitus.", 
    "131": "Aortic stenosis is a common valvular abnormality. Surgical valve replacement is the standard of care for symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis and is appropriate for certain asymptomatic patients. Statin therapy may slow progression of the disease. Contrary to conventional wisdom, vasodilator therapy may in fact be safe and effective in certain instances of severe aortic stenosis. Chronic aortic regurgitation is commonly treated with vasodilator therapy, which is certainly indicated for the asymptomatic patient with hypertension. Surgery is recommended for left ventricular dilatation, diminished ventricular systolic function, or symptoms.", 
    "132": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of lipid-lowering treatment on renal function in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This was a retrospective study of hyperlipidemic claudicants referred to a vascular surgery and risk modification clinic. Serum creatinine and urate concentrations and the fasting lipid profile were measured pretreatment and after 3-4 months of treatment with 20 mg/day simvastatin. In 103 consecutive patients with PAD (57 men; 46 women), median age 67 years (range: 51 to 83) there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine from a mean (SD) of 87 (12) micromol/L pretreatment to 84 (12) micromol/L post-treatment (p<0.0001). This difference was more marked in the tertile of patients with the highest baseline creatinine levels. There was also a significant reduction in serum urate from 0.37 (0.07) mmol/L to 0.35 (0.07) mmol/L (p<0.0001). Both these effects were independent of the degree of total cholesterol (TC) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction. There was a significant reduction in TC from 6.6 (1.0) to 5.2 (0.8) mmol/L and LDL cholesterol from 4.3 (1.0) to 2.8 (0.7) mmol/L; both p<0.0001. Significant improvement also occurred in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Cholesterol lowering with simvastatin 20 mg/day improved indices of renal function after 3-4 months of treatment in hyperlipidemic patients with PAD. Further studies are needed to establish and define the clinical relevance of these findings, especially in patients with different degrees of renal failure.",

Another 13 male Wistar rats were only fed a standard laboratory diet (control group). After 8 weeks blood samples were drawn and the livers were removed. Blood glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AP), total protein, albumin, total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were measured. Liver histopathology was also assessed.", 
    "135": "Differences were found between the control group and tube-fed groups in glucose (p < 0.001). No differences were found among tube-fed groups in blood glucose, ALT, total protein, albumin, AP and TC. AST activity was significantly higher in the Alc + Oil than in the Oil or S + Oil groups (p < 0.001 for both comparisons) demonstrating the effect of Alc on AST. The AST did not differ significantly in the Oil or S + Oil groups indicating a lack of effect of S. Furthermore, S significantly reduced the Alc-induced increase in AST (Alc + Oil vs S + Alc + Oil; p = 0.042). The TG concentration was significantly higher in the Alc + Oil group compared to the Oil, S + Oil and S + Alc + Oil groups (p = 0.02). Therefore, S significantly decreased the alcoholinduced increase in TG. Liver histopathology was similar in all groups and within the normal range.", 
    "136": "A moderate amount of Alc daily together with S is safe in rats. Additionally, S administration in Wistar rats diminishes the Alc-induced TG and AST rises.", 
    "137": "The aim of this pharmacokinetic evaluation was to show the effect of the extra methyl group in simvastatin on esterase hydrolysis between lovastatin and simvastatin in male and female volunteers. This study was based on the plasma concentration-time curves and the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin and simvastatin with its respective active metabolite statin-beta-hydroxy acid obtained from two different bioequivalence studies, each with 18 females and 18 males. Results were: The group of female volunteers showed a higher yield of the active metabolite beta-hydroxy acid than the group of males (p < 0.002) for both lovastatin and simvastatin. This difference was not related to the body weight of both groups. In the male/female groups, subject-dependent yield of active metabolite beta-hydroxy acid was demonstrated, which was independent of the formulation. The variation in plasma/liver hydrolysis resulted in a fan-shaped distribution of data points when the AUCt lovastatin was plotted vs. that of the beta-hydroxy acid metabolite. In the fan of data points, subgroups could be distinguished, each showing a different regression line and with a different Y-intercept (AUCtbeta-hydroxy acid). Lovastatin hydrolysis was higher than simvastatin hydrolysis. It was possible to discriminate between hydrolysis of both lovastatin and simvastatin by plasma/liver or tissue esterase activity. The three subgroups of subjects (males/females) showing different but high yield of statin beta-hydroxy acid can be explained by variable hydrolysis of plasma and hepatic microsomal and cytosolic carboxyesterase activity. This study showed clearly that despite the subject-dependent hydrolysis of lovastatin/simvastatin to the active metabolite, males tend to hydrolyse less than females. The extra methyl group in simvastatin results in less hydrolysis due to steric hindrance.",

Each drug was administered orally to WHHL rabbits for 24 weeks and to 1% cholesterol-fed rabbits for 10 weeks. In WHHL rabbits, HR780 at doses of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day reduced the plasma total cholesterol level by 15, 24 and 20%, respectively. In contrast, simvastatin at 5 mg/kg/day lowered the level by 23%. In 1% cholesterol-fed rabbits, HR780 (1 and 2.5 mg/kg/day) was found to inhibit the increases in the plasma total cholesterol and phospholipid levels and liver cholesterol contents in a dose-dependent manner. Simvastatin (5 mg/kg/day) also inhibited their increase. Neither HR780 nor simvastatin increased the contents of cholesterol and total bile acid in the gallbladder bile. In conclusion, long-term treatment with HR780 reduced the plasma cholesterol level in WHHL rabbits and 1% cholesterol-fed rabbits, and decreased the liver cholesterol contents in 1% cholesterol-fed rabbits.",

At follow-up, 44% of the intervention group patients and 24% of the control group patients had cholesterol levels below 4.0 mmol/L (P=0.06). The reduction in total cholesterol in the intervention group should translate to an expected 21% reduction in cardiovascular mortality risk and a 16% reduction in total mortality risk--more than twice the risk reduction achieved in the control group.

Anti-oxidative activity of blood plasma was determined by Bartosz et al. method [Curr. Top. Biophys. (1998)22:11-13], based on reduction of preformed cation radical of 2,2,azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) by blood plasma. The study comprised 35 patients with CHD risk who were randomly divided into two groups. The atorvastatin group comprised 17 patients who were administered the drug orally in a daily dose of 10 mg and the fluvastatin group consisted of 18 patients on an oral dose of 40 mg once daily. The control group comprised 12 healthy subjects with no drug administration. Blood samples were collected from cubital vein before and after 6-week therapy. Significantly (P < 0.05) increased--in comparison with the initial values--antioxidative activity of blood plasma was found in atorvastatin and fluvastatin groups after 6-week therapy. Moreover, the increase in antioxidative plasma activity in atorvastatin group was significantly higher in comparison with the fluvastatin group. The results of our study have demonstrated that atorvastatin and fluvastatin have an additional mechanism independent of the effect on cholesterol concentration. Thus, we presume that administration of these statins in CHD risk patients may have a beneficial effect."
