Here, we investigate the effect of fluvastatin on activation of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) induced by angiotensin II (AngII) in rat kidney tubule epithelial cells (NRK-52E). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) was used to detect NF-\u03baB activation. Phosphorylation of cellular p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) was determined by western blot analysis. AngII stimulated the DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB and phosphorylation of p38MAPK in cultured NRK-52E cells in a dose-dependent (10(-9)-10(-6)\u00a0mol/l) manner (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). AngII (10(-6)\u00a0mol/l) induced a rapid (5\u00a0min) increase of the p38MAPK phosphorylation. NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity was increased at as early as 30\u00a0min, peaked at 2\u00a0h after AngII treatment. This stimulatory effect of AngII on NF-\u03baB was blocked by SB203580 (a specific inhibitor of p38MAPK). Incubation of cells with fluvastatin significantly inhibited the AngII-induced NF-\u03baB activation in a dose-dependent (10(-7)-10(-5)\u00a0mol/l) manner (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Exogenous mevalonate (10(-4)mol/l) prevented the effect of fluvastatin on NF-\u03baB activation. These results suggest the fluvastatin reduced AngII-induced NF-\u03baB activation via the p38MAPK pathway in NRK-52E cells. The effect is at least partly due to blocking the biosynthesis of mevalonate.", 
    "1": "Statin therapy plays a central role in decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. However, prescribed statins are only effective if they are taken by patients on a regular basis, known as medication adherence. The factors that influence patient adherence to statin therapy can be categorized into patient factors, physician factors, and health system factors, often with interactions between the categories. Patient factors include demographics, socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and side effects. Physician factors include the physician's own adherence to applying guideline recommendations, office visits, and their interactions with patients. Health system factors include issues such as cost and access to care. Physicians should be aware of the various elements that may influence a patient's likelihood to take statin medications to improve adherence and provide the best possible patient outcomes.", 
    "2": "Statins reduce cardiovascular events by about one third; thus two out of three events occurring without any lipid lowering treatment still might happen under statin treatment. One reason may be that lipid targets are not met. The DYSlipidemia International Study (DYSIS) was performed to determine the prevalence of persistent dyslipidemia despite statin treatment in Austria.", 
    "3": "Between April 2008 and February 2009, 910 outpatients on current statin treatment and aged \u2265 45 years were recruited by general practitioners, cardiologists, endocrinologists, and internists. A clinical examination was performed and lipid values were obtained under stable statin therapy. The ESC guidelines version 2007 served as criteria to judge the attainment of treatment targets for LDL cholesterol and to reach normal HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In 765 patients a full lipid profile including fasting cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol could be obtained.", 
    "4": "Of our patients, 74.5% had at least one lipid parameter not at target. Specifically, 52.3% did not reach the LDL-cholesterol target as according to the ESC guidelines 2007 - and 56.4% as according to the Austrian lipid consensus 2010 -, 59.1% had above-target total cholesterol levels and 42.5% had elevated triglyceride levels. In 23% of the patients the HDL cholesterol was below levels associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In patients with only one single value beyond normal or targeted level, LDL cholesterol had a prevalence of 24.3%, HDL of 11.9% and triglycerides of 24.5%. In 8.4% of patients, all 3 parameters, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, were out of range.", 
    "5": "About three quarters of the Austrian patients under chronic statin therapy in routine clinical practice failed to meet lipid values as set by international and Austrian guidelines. There is an urgent need for more effective strategies to better control dyslipidemia in statin treated patients with the aim of further reducing cardiovascular events.", 
    "6": "Several studies in the last years have shown that a dysfunction of coronary microcirculation may be responsible for abnormalities in coronary blood flow and some clinical pictures. Coronary microvascular dysfunction, in absence of other coronary artery abnormalities, can cause anginal symptoms, resulting in a condition named microvascular angina (MVA). MVA can occur in a chronic form, predominantly related to effort (stable MVA), more frequently referred as cardiac syndrome X, or in an acute form, most frequently ensuing at rest, which simulates an acute coronary syndrome (unstable MVA). The main abnormalities characterizing these two forms of MVA consist of an impaired vasodilation and an increased vasoconstriction of small resistive coronary arteries, respectively. The mechanisms responsible for stable MVA are still unclear, but seem to include, together with the known traditional cardiovascular risk factors, an abnormally increased cardiac adrenergic activity. The prognosis of stable MVA is good, but some patients have progressive worsening of symptoms. Clinical outcome of patients with unstable MVA is substantially unknown, as there are no specific studies about this population. Treatment of stable MVA includes traditional anti-ischemic drugs as first step; in case of persisting symptoms several other drugs have been proposed, including xanthine derivatives, ACE-inhibitors, statins and, in women, estrogens. Severe forms of intense constriction (or spasm) of small coronary arteries may cause transmural myocardial ischemia, as the microvascular form of variant angina and the tako-tsubo syndrome.", 
    "7": "There is a considerable inter-individual variation in response to statin therapy and one third of patients do not meet their treatment goals. We aimed to identify differentially expressed genes that might be involved in the effects of statin treatment and to suggest potential markers to guide statin therapy. Forty-six healthy Korean subjects received atorvastatin; their whole-genome expression profiles in peripheral blood were analyzed before and after atorvastatin administration in relation with changes in lipid profiles. The expression patterns of the differentially expressed genes were also compared with the data of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients and controls. Pairwise comparison analyses revealed differentially expressed genes involved in diverse biological processes and molecular functions related with immune responses. Atorvastain mainly affected antigen binding, immune or inflammatory response including interleukin pathways. Similar expression patterns of the genes were observed in patients with FH and controls. The Charcol-Leyden crystal (CLC), CCR2, CX3CR1, LRRN3, FOS, LDLR, HLA-DRB1, ERMN, and TCN1 genes were significantly associated with cholesterol levels or statin response. Interestingly, the CLC gene, which was significantly altered by atorvastatin administration and differentially expressed between FH patients and controls, showed much bigger change in high-responsive group than in low-responsive group. We identified differentially expressed genes that might be involved in mechanisms underlying the known pleiotropic effects of atorvastatin, baseline cholesterol levels, and drug response. Our findings suggest CLC as a new candidate marker for statin response, and further validation is needed.", 
    "8": "The introduction of coronary stents into clinical practice has revolutionized the treatment of coronary artery disease. However, in-stent restenosis (ISR) and stent thrombosis represent the main adverse reactions following stent implantation. Along with procedural and technical factors, individual susceptibility, in particular the inflammatory response, play an important role in the development of these complications. C-reactive protein, one of the most extensively studied inflammatory biomarkers, was found to predict the risk of ISR but not of stent thrombosis in bare-metal stent (BMS)-treated patients. On the contrary, C-reactive protein failed to predict the occurrence of ISR in drug-eluting stent (DES)-treated patients, but it appeared to predict the risk of stent thrombosis. Important differences in the pathophysiological mechanisms of adverse reactions to BMS and DES account for the differences in the prognostic value of inflammatory biomarkers. Moreover, DES polymers are responsible for late hypersensitivity allergic reactions that may lead to late ISR and stent thrombosis. Notably, a correct employment of inflammatory biomarkers may become a useful tool for identification and management of high-risk patients. In this review, the evolving role of inflammatory biomarkers in predicting adverse reactions after stent implantation is discussed, underlying therapeutic and clinical consequences for the management of patients receiving a BMS or a DES.", 
    "9": "CYP3A4 is involved in the oxidative metabolism of many drugs and xenobiotics including the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin. The objective of this study was to investigate whether a new CYP3A4 functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 6 (CYP3A4*22) modifies the effect of simvastatin on total cholesterol (TOTc) or LDL cholesterol (LDLc) reduction in a population-based cohort study.", 
    "10": "In a total of 80 incident simvastatin users, the association between the CYP3A4 intron 6 C>T SNP (rs35599367) and reduction in cholesterol levels was analyzed using linear regression analysis and adjusting for potential confounding factors.", 
    "11": "The CYP3A4*22 allele was associated with a trend towards a stronger simvastatin lipid-lowering response, as reflected by the greater reduction in both TOTc and LDLc levels when compared with homozygous wild type. We observed that the CYP3A4*22 allele carriers had an increased reduction in TOTc and LDLc: -0.25 mmol/l (95% confidence interval [CI(95%)]=[-0.52; 0.01], P=0.058) and -0.29 mmol/l (CI(95%)=[-0.58; 0.01], P=0.054) when compared with homozygous CC. When we adjusted the model for potential confounding factors, the corresponding reduction in TOTc was -0.31 mmol/l (CI(95%)=[-0.59;-0.04], P=0.028) and for LDLc -0.34 mmol/l (CI(95%)=[-0.66; -0.02], P=0.034) greater for CYP3A4*22 allele carriers when compared with homozygotes wild type.", 
    "12": "The CYP3A4*22 intron 6 SNP T-variant allele was associated with reduced CYP3A4 activity, resulting in a better lipid lowering response to simvastatin, when data were adjusted for confounding factors. This observation is a step towards the clarification of the reasons of interindividual variability in statins response and may potentially lead to improved tailoring of simvastatin therapy.", 
    "13": "New Zealand (NZ) patients are recommended to undergo an 'adjusted' Framingham score to assess their cardiovascular (CVS) risk. The current (2009) NZ CVS Risk Guideline does not recommend the use of a 'calcium score' as an additional risk tool, although it has been shown to be powerfully predictive of CVS events above the predictive power of traditional Framingham risk factors. Calcium scores of >400 are very strongly predictive of a future CVS event and give direct evidence of atheromatous disease in the coronary circulation. Identification of people with advanced, premature coronary atheroma would allow early treatment of those who may benefit from more vigorous preventative strategies, including statin therapy.", 
    "14": "Using a prospectively acquired, comprehensive database we audited the first 1000 patients (7 August 2006 to 28 November 2008) to undergo a 64-slice computed tomographic (CT) cardiac angiogram (GE Light Speed), which included a scan for a 'calcium score', at the Mercy Hospital, Auckland. We excluded 58 patients who had experienced one or more of a previous myocardial infarction (MI) (n=21), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (n=15), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (n=13) or stroke (n=21) and who therefore already had definite evidence of vascular disease and would be automatically placed in a high risk strata. We calculated each patient's Framingham risk from the original 'Anderson' equation, used by the 1996 NZ CVS risk Guideline, and the 'adjusted' Framingham 5-year CVS risk using the NZ Guidelines Group 2003/2009 recommendations, and then compared this with the observed calcium scores.", 
    "15": "The mean patient age was 56 (SD 9) years; 364 (39%) patients were female, 82% patients were Caucasian. 41% were current (4.6%) or previous (36%) cigarette smokers, 35% had a history of hypertension, 44% hyperlipidaemia and 5.6% had diabetes mellitus. The percentage of patients at 'low' 5-Year CVS risk (0-10% 5-year risk), using the 1996 and 2003/2009 guideline methods, was 78% and 58% respectively. Of patients in these Framingham 'low-risk' groups, 10% and 8.8% had a calcium score of >400 Agatston units, indicating that they were actually at very high CVS risk, and 203 (28%) and 147 (27%) respectively had a calcium score of >100 Agatston units, indicating that they were actually at 'high risk' and not 'low risk'.", 
    "16": "Approximately 10% to 27% of patients with a low CVS risk as assessed by the established Framingham equation have a markedly increased calcium score and hence a significantly increased risk of a CVS event. Currently promoted methods of risk assessment may be inadvertently, falsely re-assuring these patients. Clinicians managing patients may consider a calcium score as an additional tool to the standard risk assessment strategies.", 
    "17": "A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospodin motif 4 (ADAMTS4) has been shown to be an important player in atherosclerosis. However, the clinical significance of measuring serum ADAMTS4 levels has not been fully elucidated. We therefore investigate whether serum ADAMTS4 levels are associated with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "18": "Serum levels of ADAMTS4 were measured in 192 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography for suspected CAD, the severity of CAD was determined by the number of diseased vessels and the severity score of coronary stenosis.", 
    "19": "Patients with CAD showed significantly higher levels of ADAMTS4 than did patients with normal coronary arteries [57.82 (48.96-70.32) vs. 46.55 (41.16-51.72) ng/ml, P<0.001]. ADAMTS4 levels increased with the number of diseased vessels (P<0.05) and significantly associated with severity score of stenosis (rs=0.601, P<0.001). In the multivariate analysis, ADAMTS4 levels were found to be independently correlated with the presence and severity of CAD. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis revealed that a cut-off of serum ADAMTS4 levels of 51.63 ng/ml could predict CAD with a 76% sensitivity and a 69% specificity. ADAMTS4 levels were significantly lower in patients with statin treatment than in those without it [47.49 (42.30, 57.09) vs. 56.39 (47.05, 68.94) ng/ml, P<0.05].", 
    "20": "In conclusion, serum ADAMTS4 levels are associated with the presence and the severity of CAD, ADAMTS4 might serve as an independent factor for predicting CAD. Statin therapy reduces the serum levels of ADAMTS4.", 
    "21": "We investigated whether atorvastatin has beneficial hemodynamic effects during acute pulmonary thromboembolism (APT) and whether sildenafil improves these effects. We studied the involvement of oxidative stress, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and neutrophil activation. APT was induced with autologous blood clots (500 mg/kg) in anesthetized male lambs pretreated with atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously; 1 week) or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide 10% subcutaneously). Sildenafil (0.7 mg/kg intravenously) or saline infusions were performed 60 min after APT induction. Non-embolized control animals received saline. APT significantly increased pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) and mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) by approximately 310% and 258% respectively. While atorvastatin pretreatment attenuated these increases (~150% and 153%, respectively; P < 0.05), its combination with sildenafil was associated with lower increases in PVRI and MPAP (~32% and 36%, respectively). Gelatin zymography showed increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage, and increased MMP-9 levels in plasma from embolized animals. Atorvastatin pretreatment attenuated bronchoalveolar lavage MMP-2 increases. The combination of drugs blunted the MMPs increases in bronchoalveolar lavage and plasma (P < 0.05). Neutrophils accumulated in bronchoalveolar lavage after APT, and atorvastatin pretreatment combined with sildenafil (but not atorvastatin alone) attenuated this effect (P < 0.05). APT increased lung lipid peroxidation and total protein concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage, thus indicating oxidative stress and alveolar-capillary barrier damage, respectively. Both increases were attenuated by atorvastatin pretreatment alone or combined with sildenafil (P < 0.05). We conclude that pretreatment with atorvastatin protects against the pulmonary hypertension associated with APT and that sildenafil improves this response. These findings may reflect antioxidant effects and inhibited neutrophils/MMPs activation.", 
    "22": "In the present work, three different spectrophotometric methods for simultaneous estimation of ramipril, aspirin and atorvastatin calcium in raw materials and in formulations are described. Overlapped data was quantitatively resolved by using chemometric methods, viz. inverse least squares (ILS), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS). Calibrations were constructed using the absorption data matrix corresponding to the concentration data matrix. The linearity range was found to be 1-5, 10-50 and 2-10 \u03bcg mL-1 for ramipril, aspirin and atorvastatin calcium, respectively. The absorbance matrix was obtained by measuring the zero-order absorbance in the wavelength range between 210 and 320 nm. A training set design of the concentration data corresponding to the ramipril, aspirin and atorvastatin calcium mixtures was organized statistically to maximize the information content from the spectra and to minimize the error of multivariate calibrations. By applying the respective algorithms for PLS 1, PCR and ILS to the measured spectra of the calibration set, a suitable model was obtained. This model was selected on the basis of RMSECV and RMSEP values. The same was applied to the prediction set and capsule formulation. Mean recoveries of the commercial formulation set together with the figures of merit (calibration sensitivity, selectivity, limit of detection, limit of quantification and analytical sensitivity) were estimated. Validity of the proposed approaches was successfully assessed for analyses of drugs in the various prepared physical mixtures and formulations.", 
    "23": "It has been reported that polymorphisms in the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1, SLCO1B1) result in decreased hepatic uptake of simvastatin carboxy acid, the active metabolite of simvastatin. This is not the case for fluvastatin and it has been hypothesized that for this drug other hepatic uptake pathways exist. Here, we studied whether Na(+)-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP, SLC10A1) can be an alternative hepatic uptake route for fluvastatin. Chinese Hamster Ovary cells transfected with human NTCP (CHO-NTCP) were used to investigate the inhibitory effect of fluvastatin and other statins on [(3)H]-taurocholic acid uptake ([(3)H]-TCA). Statin uptake by CHO-NTCP and cryopreserved human hepatocytes was assessed via LC-MS/MS. Fluvastatin appeared to be a potent and competitive inhibitor of [(3)H]-TCA uptake (IC(50) of 40\u03bcM), pointing to an interaction at the level of the bile acid binding pocket of NTCP. The inhibitory action of other statins was also studied, which revealed that statin inhibitory potency increased with molecular descriptors of lipophilicity: calculated logP (r(2)=0.82, p=0.034), logD(7.4) (r(2)=0.77, p=0.0001). Studies in CHO-NTCP cells showed that fluvastatin was indeed an NTCP substrate (K(m) 250\u00b130\u03bcM, V(max) 1340\u00b150ng/mg total cell protein/min). However, subsequent studies revealed that at clinically relevant plasma concentrations, NTCP contributed minimally to overall accumulation in human hepatocytes. In conclusion, fluvastatin interacts with NTCP at the level of the bile acid binding pocket and is an NTCP substrate. However, under normal conditions, NTCP-mediated uptake of this drug seems not to be a significant hepatocellular uptake pathway.", 
    "24": "The high mortality of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses infection in humans gives rise to considerable concern that it might someday cause another lethal pandemic. At present there is no other effective alternative besides the early and enough administration of neuraminidase inhibitors, which may be crucial for the patient management. However, its efficacy is sometimes limited because of the late administration in some patients especially the seriously ill ones and the continual occurrence of oseltamivir resistant A (H5N1) strains. The specific candidate vaccine are still under development and the practical value of passive immunization is hard to be widely applied because of the scarcity of convalescent human plasma, especially in the early stage of a serious and rapidly progressing pandemic. Statins and fibrates, both of which are used in clinical practice, have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects and other multiple biologic activities. So we hypothesized that the two immunomodulatory agents may exhibit synergistic effects when they were combined to neuraminidase inhibitors to treat the A (H5N1) viruses infections via inhibiting the production of either the early inflammatory mediators (e.g., many cytokine/chemokine) or the late mediator (e.g., High Mobility Group Box Protein 1), even showing the anti-viral activities with the prevention of the development of antiviral resistance. Therefore, the novel triple combinations may be an optimal management to confront the next lethal influenza pandemic on its very beginning.",

CAC and aorta calcification scores increased significantly (by a median of 11% and 4% per year, respectively) during follow-up. By multivariable linear regression, higher baseline CAC score, history of cardiovascular event, use of a statin, and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) level were independent determinants of CAC progression. Independent determinants of aorta calcification progression were higher baseline aorta calcification score, higher pulse pressure, use of a statin, older age, higher serum phosphate level, use of aspirin, and male sex. Significant regression of CAC or aorta calcification was not observed in this cohort.",

    "37": "Arterial dysfunction (AD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) predicts cardiovascular events. The objective was to investigate the prevalence and predictors of AD in statin-treated T2DM patients. We measured flow-mediated (FMD) and nitrate-mediated (NMD) brachial artery dilatation in 86 statin-treated T2DM patients. Patients were classified into 2 groups: normal arterial function (FMD \u22653.7% with NMD \u226511.9%) or AD (FMD <3.7% with or without NMD <11.9%). Endothelial dysfunction without smooth muscle cell dysfunction (ED) was defined as FMD less than 3.7% with NMD of at least 11.9%, and endothelial dysfunction with smooth muscle cell dysfunction (ED/SMD) was defined as FMD less than 3.7% with NMD less than 11.9%. Predictors of arterial function were investigated using linear and logistic regression methods. The prevalence of AD was 33.7% (23.2% with ED and 10.5% with ED/SMD). In multivariate linear regression, history of hypertension (P < .01), statin dose (P < .05), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = .02) were significant predictors of FMD. Sex (P < .01) and creatinine (P = .03) or eGFR (P = .02) predicted NMD. In multivariate logistic regression, the independent predictors of AD were history of hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 8.79; 95% confidence interval, 2.14-36.12; P < .01), age (OR, 1.08; 1.01-1.17; P = .03), and statin dose (OR, 0.33; 0.12-0.87; P = .02). A history of hypertension (OR, 8.99; 1.87-43.26; P < .01) was the sole independent predictor of ED; eGFR (OR, 0.01; 0.00-0.26; P < .01) independently predicted ED/SMD. Our data suggest that one third of statin-treated diabetic patients have residual AD, mainly due to ED alone. Earlier identification and treatment of hypertension and renal impairment may improve AD and further decrease cardiovascular risk in such patients.", 
    "38": "Drug adulteration in dietary supplement materials is a world-wide problem and poses a regulatory challenge. Red yeast rice is a product used by consumers to lower blood levels of cholesterol. While most current methods to analyze red yeast rice are based on HPLC separation with a photo-diode array detector and/or a mass spectrometry detector, which takes 20-40min analysis time per sample, we developed a method to do fast screening of the active compound lovastatin by direct infusion into a mass spectrometer. This method takes under 1min per analysis on the instrument. By using multiple reaction monitoring with five product ions, all the ion ratios of the analyte in the samples are compared with those from the standards for qualitative analysis. The results from this method were compared to the result from the liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, which uses retention time and one ion ratio as the confirmation criteria. No false positives or false negatives were found among the 12 samples tested. The method also seems to be effective in measuring the lovastatin in red yeast rice semi-quantitatively. This kind of method could be adapted to the screening of other dietary supplement products.",

We studied influence of polymorphic marker Trp719Arg of KIF6 gene on lipid and nonlipid effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin. The studied genetic marker is associated with risk of development of ischemic heart disease and myocardial infarction as well as efficacy of therapy with statins according to data of a number of large multicenter studies. We examined 60 men with ischemic heart disease which had manifested in young age when genetic factors were most expressed and had special significance. Efficacy of 40 mg/day simvastatin did not depend on genotypes of polymorphic marker Trp719Arg of KIF6. Therapy with 10 mg/day atorvastatin was more effective in carriers of polymorphic marker Trp719Arg of KIF6 gene by action on dynamics of changes of high sensitivity C-reactive protein and dispersion of high density lipoprotein response. Increase of atorvastatin dose to 80 mg/day abolished influence of genotypes. Thus for the first time we discovered influence of polymorphic marker Trp719Arg of KIF6 gene on individual response to therapy with 10 mg/day of atorvastatin, while and apoA1, structural protein of high density lipoproteins can be considered as a marker of \"fast response\".",

Fenofibrate also has nonlipid, pleiotropic effects (e.g. reducing levels of fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and various pro-inflammatory markers, and improving flow-mediated dilatation) that may contribute to its clinical efficacy, particularly in terms of improving microvascular outcomes. Fenofibrate improves the lipid profile (particularly triglyceride [TG] and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol [HDL-C] levels) in patients with dyslipidaemia. Compared with statin monotherapy, fenofibrate monotherapy tends to improve TG and HDL-C levels to a significantly greater extent, whereas statins improve low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol levels to a significantly greater extent. Fenofibrate is also associated with promoting a shift from small, dense, atherogenic LDL particles to larger, less dense LDL particles. Combination therapy with a statin plus fenofibrate generally improves the lipid profile to a greater extent than monotherapy with either agent in patients with dyslipidaemia and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. In the pivotal FIELD and ACCORD trials in patients with type 2 diabetes, fenofibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease events to a greater extent than placebo, and simvastatin plus fenofibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of major cardiovascular (CV) events to a greater extent than simvastatin plus placebo. However, the risk of some nonfatal macrovascular events and the incidence of certain microvascular outcomes were reduced significantly more with fenofibrate than with placebo in the FIELD trial, and in the ACCORD trial, patients receiving simvastatin plus fenofibrate were less likely to experience progression of diabetic retinopathy than those receiving simvastatin plus placebo. Subgroup analyses in the FIELD and ACCORD Lipid trials indicate that fenofibrate is of the greatest benefit in decreasing CV events in patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Fenofibrate is generally well tolerated when administered alone or in combination with a statin. Thus, in patients with dyslipidaemia, particularly atherogenic dyslipidaemia, fenofibrate is a useful treatment option either alone or in combination with a statin.", 
    "45": "The factors for the individual differences include both genetic and environmental factors. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) was first developed in RIKEN in 2002 and has now become a major research technology. In GWAS, the associations between genomic variations and the variations in the traits are analyzed by statistical genetics. As many as 100,000-2,500,000 polymorphic loci are distributed over the whole genome, and the associations between either genotypes or alleles and the phenotypes are analyzed. The phenotypes are either diseases, physical data or clinical laboratory data, and it was found that the targets of the available drugs are often included in the genes that were found to be associated with the diseases. These data indicate that the results from GWAS may be applied to the development of new drugs (GWDD; genome-wide drug discovery). GWAS started to influence pharmacogenomics in which the associations between genomic variations and drug reactions are studied. Genes associated with statin-induced severe muscle damage, efficacy of interferon for C-type hepatitis, ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia and carbamazepine-induced severe skin eruption were found by GWAS. In 2010, \"Guidelines for clinical studies and tests in which pharmacogenomics is applied\" was released as a draft.",

Current guidelines emphasize the need to aggressively lower LDL-C in FH patients, and statins are the cornerstone in the current regimen. However, additional therapies are eagerly awaited, especially for those patients not tolerating statin therapy or not reaching the goals for therapy. Our understanding of LDL metabolism has improved over the last years and an increasing number of potential novel targets for therapy have been recently identified. Apart from novel targets, we have also been confronted with novel modalities of treatment, such as mRNA antisense therapy. Some of these emerging therapies have proven to be effective in lowering plasma LDL-C levels and are as such expected to have beneficial effects on CVD. Hopefully, they will enrich our armamentarium against the severe dyslipidemia observed in FH patients in the not too distant future.",

The aortic root diameters of untreated Marfan mice were significantly increased in comparison to normal mice (0.161 \u00b1 0.001 cm vs 0.252 \u00b1 0.004 cm; P<0.01). Pravastatin (0.22 \u00b1 0.003 cm; P<0.01) and losartan (0.221 \u00b1 0.004 cm; P<0.01) produced a significant reduction in aortic root dilation.

Reduced blood flow to heart tissue leads to decreased heart function and symptoms of heart failure. Therapies to improve heart function in chronic coronary artery disease are important to identify. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are an important therapy for prevention of coronary artery disease, but also have non-cholesterol lowering effects. Our prior work showed that pravastatin improves contractile function in the chronically ischemic heart in pigs. Endothelial progenitor cells are a potential source of new blood vessels in ischemic tissues. While statins are known to increase the number of early outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells, their effects on late outgrowth endothelial progenitor cells (LOEPCs) and capillary density in ischemic heart tissue are not known. We hypothesized that statins exert positive effects on the mobilization and growth of late outgrowth EPCs, and capillary density in ischemic heart tissue.",

We also determined the density of capillaries in myocardial tissue in pigs with chronic myocardial ischemia with or without treatment with pravastatin. Pravastatin therapy resulted in greater than two-fold increase in CD31+ LOEPCs versus untreated animals. Addition of pravastatin or simvastatin to blood mononuclear cells increased the number of LOEPCs greater than three fold in culture. Finally, in animals with chronic myocardial ischemia, pravastatin increased capillary density 46%.",

RTx patients received a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based (65%) or a CNI-free therapy (35%) and steroids. EPC number was determined by double positive staining for CD133/VEGFR2 and CD34/VEGFR2 by flow cytometry. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1) levels were assessed by ELISA. Experimentally, to dissociate the impact of RTx from the impact of immunosuppressants, we used the 5/6 nephrectomy model. The animals were treated with a CNI-based or a CNI-free therapy, and EPCs (Sca+cKit+) and CD26+ cells were determined by flow cytometry.", 
    "75": "Compared to controls, circulating number of CD34+/VEGFR2+ and CD133+/VEGFR2+ EPCs increased in RTx patients. There were no correlations between EPC levels and statin, erythropoietin or use of renin angiotensin system blockers in our study. Indeed, multivariate analysis showed that SDF-1--a cytokine responsible for EPC mobilization--is independently associated with the EPC number. 5/6 rats presented decreased EPC counts in comparison to control animals. Immunosuppressive therapy was able to restore normal EPC values in 5/6 rats. These effects on EPC number were associated with reduced number of CD26+ cells, which might be related to consequent accumulation of SDF-1.",

The etiology is for the most part, dependent on the age at presentation; the two predominant causes in the western world are calcific aortic valve disease arising in a tricuspid aortic valve and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). CAS is a progressive disease, exhibiting a spectrum of pathologic findings, ranging from valvular sclerosis to severe nodular calcification. Aortic valve replacement is the recommended treatment for severe disease but tissue valves may also calcify over time.

The physicochemical parameters of LT-NLC were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, morphology, entrapment efficiency, and crystallization behavior. Targeting behavior and mechanism were demonstrated by the incubation of LT-NLC-apo with a RAW 264.7 macrophage-derived foam cell model in the presence or absence of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and lipase. The results showed that LT-NLC was solid spherical or oval in shape with an average diameter of 13.8 \u00b1 2.2 nm, zeta potential of -29.3 \u00b1 0.2 mV and entrapment efficiency of 96.2 \u00b1 1.3%. Phagocytosis studies showed that uptake of LT-NLC-apo by macrophages was significantly lower than LT-NLC (p\u2009<\u20090.01), suggesting that LT-NLC-apo could possibly escape recognition from macrophages in vivo. The uptake was increased twofold when LT-NLC-apo was incubated with transfected foam cells containing VLDL and lipase. These results indicated that non-protein NLC resembling HDL could be a useful tool to deliver lipophilic anti-atherogenic drugs to foam cells, and that uptake could be enhanced by the VLDL receptor pathway.",

The administration of pravastatin to BDL animals attenuated proliferation changes in liver parenchyma, prevented HO-1 induction, restored hepatic mRNA hepcidin expression to control levels and induced the expression of ferritin, transferrin receptors (TfR1/2) and divalent metal transporter-1. This was accompanied by an increased content of intrahepatic iron when compared to the BDL animals, and a reduction of hyperbilirubinemia.", 
    "98": "Cholestasis-induced increase in plasma and decrease in hepatic iron levels were associated with up-regulation of liver HO-1 and ferroportin 1.

Previous studies indicated that induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) exerts a cytoprotective activity in several inflammatory diseases. Here, the possibility that HO-1 is involved in the anti-inflammatory action of simvastatin, using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages as a model system has been specifically addressed. Our results demonstrated that in the presence of LPS, simvastatin significantly increased HO-1 expression and activity in a dose-dependent manner compared to that of LPS-stimulated alone macrophages. Moreover, simvastatin significantly inhibited LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression, and formation of pro-inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), nitrite and free radicals, but enhanced interleukin-10 (IL-10) production. Similarly, the I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation and nuclear transcription factor-\u03baB translocation and activation caused by LPS were significantly suppressed by simvastatin. However, these anti-inflammatory activities of simvastatin were markedly reversed by addition of a HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP). Accordingly, the present results indicate that the anti-inflammatory activity of simvastatin could, at least in part, be regulated by induction of HO-1-mediated processes.",

    "112": "In this work, rosuvastatin has been used to gain insight into the molecular basis of statin photosensitization. This lipid-lowering drug, also known as \"superstatin\", contains a 2-vinylbiphenyl-like moiety and has been previously described to decompose under solar irradiation, yielding stable dihydrophenanthrene analogues. During photophysical characterization of rosuvastatin, only a long-lived transient at ca. 550 nm was observed and assigned to the primary photocyclization intermediate. Thus, the absence of detectable triplet-triplet absorption and the low yield of fluorescence rules out the role of the parent drug as an efficient sensitizer. In this context, the attention has been placed on the rosuvastatin main photoproduct (ppRSV). Indeed, the photobehavior of this dihydrophenanthrene-like compound presents the essential components needed for an efficient biomolecule photosensitizer i.e. (i) a high intersystem crossing quantum yield (\u03a6(ISC) = 0.8), (ii) a triplet excited state energy of ca. 67 kcal mol(-1), and (iii) a quantum yield of singlet oxygen formation (\u03a6(\u0394)) of 0.3. Furthermore, laser flash photolysis studies revealed a triplet-triplet energy transfer from the triplet excited state of ppRSV to thymidine, leading to the formation of cyclobutane thymidine dimers, an important type of DNA lesion. Finally, tryptophan has been used as a probe to investigate the type I and/or type II character of ppRSV-mediated oxidation. In this way, both an electron transfer process giving rise to the tryptophanyl radical and a singlet oxygen mediated oxidation were observed. On the basis of the obtained results, rosuvastatin, through its major photoproduct ppRSV, should be considered as a potential sensitizer.",

Therefore, atorvastatin/metformin ER 10\u2009mg/500\u2009mg FDC tablets can be used safely in clinical settings to decrease the pill burden and increase patient compliance with therapy.", 
    "158": "In clinical studies of statins (class of drugs lowering plasma cholesterol levels), transient low-molecular-weight proteinuria was observed. The causes of statin-induced proteinuria in the patient background of those studies (cardiovascular and kidney disease) are multifactorial and, therefore, a matter of debate. In light of this, it seemed interesting to investigate the effect of statins on the urinary protein concentration and proteome in healthy volunteers. Six healthy volunteers were randomly treated with rosuvastatin (40 mg/day) or pravastatin (80 mg/day) in a double-blinded cross-over study. Total urinary protein concentration and the concentration of albumin/retinol-binding protein were analysed, after which the urinary proteome was investigated. From the results described in this study, it was concluded that statins do not induce major changes in the urinary protein concentration/proteome. High variability in the baseline urinary proteome/proteins among volunteers, however, made it very difficult to find subtle (possibly isolated to individuals) effects of statins.", 
    "159": "The past decade has seen substantial advances in cardiovascular pharmacogenomics. Genetic determinants of response to clopidogrel and warfarin have been defined, resulting in changes to the product labels for these drugs that suggest the use of genetic information as a guide for therapy. Genetic tests are available, as are guidelines for incorporation of genetic information into patient-care decisions. These guidelines and the literature supporting them are reviewed herein. Significant advances have also been made in the pharmacogenomics of statin-induced myopathy and the response to \u03b2-blockers in heart failure, although the clinical applications of these findings are less clear. Other areas hold promise, including the pharmacogenomics of antihypertensive drugs, aspirin, and drug-induced long-QT syndrome (diLQTS). The potential value of pharmacogenomics in the discovery and development of new drugs is also described. In summary, pharmacogenomics has current applications in the management of cardiovascular disease, with clinically relevant data continuing to mount.",

The best CIMT protocol would be one that combines high reproducibility, a large and precise estimate of the rate of CIMT progression and a large and precise estimate of the treatment effect. We performed a post-hoc analysis to determine the best algorithm for determining CIMT using data from the METEOR study, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effect of rosuvastatin on CIMT progression in 984 low coronary heart disease risk individuals with increased CIMT.",

On the basis of combinations of these measurements, we built 66 different ultrasound protocols to estimate a CIMT for each individual (22 protocols for mean common CIMT, 44 protocols for mean maximum CIMT). For each protocol we assessed reproducibility [intraclass correlation (ICC), mean difference of duplicate scans], 2-year progression rate in the placebo group with its corresponding standard error and treatment effect (difference in CIMT progression between rosuvastatin and placebo) and its corresponding standard error.", 
    "162": "Data of duplicate ultrasound examinations at baseline and end of study were available for 688 participants (70% of 984). The ICC based on duplicate baseline examinations ranged from 0.81 to 0.95. CIMT progression rates in the placebo group ranged from 0.0046 to 0.0177 mm/year, with SE ranging from 0.00134 to 0.00337. Treatment effects ranged from 0.0141 to 0.0388 mm/year.

    "164": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by ovarian enlargement, theca-interstitial hyperplasia, and increased androgen production by theca cells. Previously, our group has demonstrated that statins (competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, a rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway) reduce proliferation of theca-interstitial cells in vitro and decrease serum androgen levels in women with PCOS. The present study evaluated the effect of simvastatin on rat ovarian theca-interstitial cell steroidogenesis. Because actions of statins may be due to reduced cholesterol availability and/or isoprenylation of proteins, the present study also investigated whether steroidogenesis was affected by cell- and mitochondrion-permeable 22-hydroxycholesterol, isoprenylation substrates (farnesyl-pyrophosphate [FPP] and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate [GGPP]), as well as selective inhibitors of farnesyltransferase (FTI) and geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTI). Theca-interstitial cells were cultured for 12, 24, and 48 h with or without simvastatin, GGPP, FPP, FTI, GGTI, and/or 22-hydroxycholesterol. Simvastatin decreased androgen levels in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion. This inhibitory effect correlated with a decrease in mRNA levels of Cyp17a1, the gene encoding the key enzyme regulating androgen biosynthesis. After 48 h, GGPP alone and FPP alone had no effect on Cyp17a1 mRNA expression; however, the inhibitory action of simvastatin was partly abrogated by both GGPP and FPP. The present findings indicate that statin-induced reduction of androgen levels is likely due, at least in part, to the inhibition of isoprenylation, resulting in decreased expression of CYP17A1.",

    "170": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a dominantly inherited disorder present from birth that causes marked elevation in plasma cholesterol and premature coronary heart disease. There are at least 45,000 people with FH in Australia and New Zealand, but the vast majority remains undetected and those diagnosed with the condition are inadequately treated. To bridge this major gap in coronary prevention the FH Australasia Network (Australian Atherosclerosis Society) has developed a consensus model of care (MoC) for FH. The MoC is based on clinical experience, expert opinion, published evidence and consultations with a wide spectrum of stakeholders, and has been developed for use primarily by specialist centres intending starting a clinical service for FH. This MoC aims to provide a standardised, high-quality and cost-effective system of care that is likely to have the highest impact on patient outcomes. The MoC for FH is presented as a series of recommendations and algorithms focusing on the standards required for the detection, diagnosis, assessment and management of FH in adults and children. The process involved in cascade screening and risk notification, the backbone for detecting new cases of FH, is detailed. Guidance on treatment is based on risk stratifying patients, management of non-cholesterol risk factors, safe and effective use of statins, and a rational approach to follow-up of patients. Clinical and laboratory recommendations are given for genetic testing. An integrative system for providing best clinical care is described. This MoC for FH is not prescriptive and needs to be complemented by good clinical judgment and adjusted for local needs and resources. After initial implementation, the MoC will require critical evaluation, development and appropriate modification.",

    "175": "Worldwide, the leading causes of death are ischemic heart disease and stroke. Moreover, patients with several risk factors or a history of ischemic heart disease are at a high risk of coronary event recurrence. There is evidence that primary cardiovascular disease prevention programs are effective when applied to the general population. However, therapeutic strategies designed to control several risk factors simultaneously in patients without evidence of cardiovascular disease are expensive and difficult to implement. In contrast, combination drug therapy is commonly used for secondary cardiovascular prevention and its beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality have been clearly demonstrated. Nevertheless, the actual impact of this approach is less than might be expected, partly because of poor adherence to drug regimens and the high cost of treatment in low- and middle-income countries. In patients who have had an acute myocardial infarction, the complexity of the regimen is inversely correlated ith compliance and is, in most cases, the reason for treatment discontinuation. Moreover, globally the ast majority of cardiovascular events take place in developing countries with limited health resources here access to treatment is poor. The development of fixed-dose combinations of drugs (i.e. polypills) designed for the treatment of myocardial infarction patients could help overcome these limitations, improve compliance and facilitate the distribution of and access to treatment in developing countries. We have begun a large clinical trial in five countries to investigate the beneficial effects of treatment using a polypill (i.e. aspirin, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a statin) on ischemic heart disease recurrence. The results of this study could provide the basis for a new therapeutic approach to the management of not only cardiovascular disease but also diabetes and stroke.",

    "177": "Statins have marked beneficial effects on lipid profile, but also have pleiotropic actions. A previous study in an iodine-deficient area suggested that statin use is associated with reduced thyroid volume and nodularity. We performed this study to investigate how long-term statin use in type 2 diabetic patients affects thyroid nodularity in iodine-sufficient area.We recruited euthyroid type 2 diabetic patients, receiving statin therapy continuously for at least 5 years (statin group) and, age and sex matched statin-naive type 2 diabetic patients (control group). Subjects with past history of cancer, thyroid disease or treatment with lithium or amiodarone; family history of thyroid cancer; palpable goiter or thyroid nodule, and/or positive thyroperoxidase antibody were excluded. The prevalence, number, and volume of thyroid nodules, size of thyroid were evaluated in all subjects by high resolution ultrasound.Prevalence of non-palpable thyroid nodules of statin group (n=70) and control group (n=98) were 51 and 53%, respectively. There was no difference of prevalence, number, and volume of non-palpable thyroid nodules and size of thyroid between statin and control group. But, the patients aged between 60 and 65 years from statin group showed lower prevalence of non-palpable thyroid nodules than the patients with same age interval from control group (4 out of 12 patients, 33%, statin group; 19 out of 27 patients, 70%, control group; P=0.04).Long-term statin use in elderly type 2 diabetic patients was associated with lesser prevalence of thyroid nodules in an iodine-sufficient area. Our data might support a possible antiproliferative effect of statins on thyroid in old type 2 diabetic patients. But, the effect was not as strong as that in an iodine-deficient area and further studies with enough numbers of subjects and revised design will be needed.",

Systolic blood pressure was measured by plethysmography in the central artery of the tail. The serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, nitric oxide, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were analyzed.

    "182": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US. Despite the decline in CVD-associated mortality rates in recent years, coronary heart disease (CHD) still causes one in every six deaths in this country. Because most CHD risk factors are modifiable (eg, smoking, hypertension, obesity, onset of type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia), cardiovascular risk can be reduced by timely and appropriate interventions, such as smoking cessation, diet and lifestyle changes, and lipid-modifying therapy. Dyslipidemia, manifested by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is central to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, which can be silent for decades before triggering a first major cardiovascular event. Consequently, dyslipidemia has become a primary target of intervention in strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular events. The guidelines of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, updated in 2004, recommend therapeutic lifestyle changes and the use of lipid-lowering medications, such as statins, to achieve specific LDL-C goals based on a person's global cardiovascular risk. For high-risk individuals, such as patients with CHD and diabetic patients without CHD, an LDL-C target of < 100 mg/dL is recommended, and statin therapy should be considered to help patients achieve this goal. If correctly dosed in appropriate patients, currently approved statins are generally safe and provide significant cardiovascular benefits in diverse populations, including women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes. A recent primary prevention trial also showed that statins benefit individuals traditionally not considered at high risk of CHD, such as those with no hyperlipidemia but elevated C-reactive protein. Additional evidence suggests that statins may halt or slow atherosclerotic disease progression. Recent evidence confirms the pivotal role of statins in primary and secondary prevention.",

    "192": "Nitric oxide (NO) is an antiatherogenic vasodilator synthesized from arginine and, indirectly, from citrulline through argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) and argininosuccinate lyase (ASL). Hypercholesterolemia-induced atherosclerosis is usually treated by statins, which decrease cholesterolemia and increase endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity. Therefore, a treatment associating a statin with arginine or citrulline could be more efficient than statin alone. The aim of this study was to optimize NO production in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) by a combination of simvastatin with arginine or citrulline and to identify the molecular mechanisms involved. NO production was measured after stimulation of BAEC in different conditions (simvastatin 0 to 10 \u03bcM associated with arginine or citrulline 0 to 5 mM) after 24-hour incubation. Intracellular levels of specific proteins were evaluated by Western-Blot analysis, and mRNA levels of eNOS, iNOS, caveolin-1, ASS and ASL were assessed by RT-PCR. Simvastatin co-administrated with arginine or citrulline increased NO production, but at simvastatin 10 \u03bcM, 1 mM arginine-induced NO production was significantly (P < 0.01) higher than 1 mM citrulline-induced NO production. Simvastatin induced an increase in eNOS mRNA expression and protein levels in the presence of arginine or citrulline. ASS and ASL mRNA levels were increased by simvastatin, whereas a high substrate concentration (1 mM) strongly decreased ASL mRNA levels. Combining statin with arginine or citrulline increased NO production in endothelial cells by increasing eNOS protein levels. These results form a strong rationale to evaluate the potential utilization of these in atherosclerosis prevention and treatment.", 
    "193": "In this study, the effects of simvastatin on the blood pressure and on the antihypertensive activity of ramipril in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals and patients were evaluated. In hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals, repeated administration of simvastatin slightly but significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure, enhanced its progressive reductions induced by repeated administration of ramipril and corrected the compromised lipid profile. Concomitantly, repeated administration of simvastatin, ramipril or simvastatin in combination with ramipril to these animals, increased nitric oxide (NO) production and decreased the elevated serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. The effects of combined treatment were greater than those of simvastatin or ramipril alone. In hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients, repeated administration of ramipril decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, increased NO production, and decreased the elevated serum MDA and hs-CRP levels. Addition of simvastatin to ramipril therapy enhanced these effects and corrected the compromised lipid profile. Simvastatin but not ramipril inhibited the contractile responses of isolated aortic rings induced by angiotensin 11. l-arginine and acetylcholine enhanced, while l-NAME inhibited effects of simvastatin, and simvastatin in combination with ramipril on these contractile responses. These findings suggest that simvastatin exerts antihypertensive effect and enhances the antihypertensive effect of ramipril in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic animals and patients. In addition to its cholesterol-lowering effect, the ability of simvastatin to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction through increasing NO bioavailability and through suppression of oxidative stress and vascular inflammation and its ability to enhance the effect of ramipril on these parameters may play a pivotal role in these effects.",

Two-hybrid co-activator interaction and co-repressor release assays were utilized to elucidate the molecular mechanism of PXR activation.", 
    "196": "All atorvastatin metabolites induced the assembly of PXR and activated CYP3A4 promoter activity. Ligand binding to CAR could not be proven. In primary human hepatocytes, the para-hydroxy metabolite markedly reduced or abolished induction of cytochrome P450 and transporter genes. While significant differences in co-activator recruitment were not observed, para-hydroxy atorvastatin demonstrated only 50% release of co-repressors.", 
    "197": "Atorvastatin metabolites are ligands of PXR but not of CAR. Atorvastatin metabolites demonstrate differential induction of PXR target genes, which results from impaired release of co-repressors. Consequently, the properties of drug metabolites have to be taken into account when analysing PXR-dependent induction of drug metabolism and transport. The drug interaction potential of the active metabolite, para-hydroxy atorvastatin, might be lower than that of the parent compound.",

However, these concentrations by far exceed the concentrations detected in human blood during simvastatin therapy (1-15 nmol/L) and single doses of statins given to healthy volunteers did not improve antibacterial effects of whole blood. Thus, a direct bactericidal effect of statins in vivo is probably not the mechanism behind the observed beneficial effect of statins against various infections.", 
    "203": "Effects of Chk1 and MEK1/2 inhibition were investigated in cytokinetically quiescent multiple myeloma (MM) and primary CD138(+) cells. Coexposure to the Chk1 and MEK1/2 inhibitors AZD7762 and selumetinib (AZD6244) robustly induced apoptosis in various MM cells and CD138(+) primary samples, but spared normal CD138(-) and CD34(+) cells. Furthermore, Chk1/MEK1/2 inhibitor treatment of asynchronized cells induced G(0)/G(1) arrest and increased apoptosis in all cell-cycle phases, including G(0)/G(1). To determine whether this regimen is active against quiescent G(0)/G(1) MM cells, cells were cultured in low-serum medium to enrich the G(0)/G(1) population. G(0)/G(1)-enriched cells exhibited diminished sensitivity to conventional agents (eg, Taxol and VP-16) but significantly increased susceptibility to Chk1 \u00b1 MEK1/2 inhibitors or Chk1 shRNA knock-down. These events were associated with increased \u03b3H2A.X expression/foci formation and Bim up-regulation, whereas Bim shRNA knock-down markedly attenuated lethality. Immunofluorescent analysis of G(0)/G(1)-enriched or primary MM cells demonstrated colocalization of activated caspase-3 and the quiescent (G(0)) marker statin, a nuclear envelope protein. Finally, Chk1/MEK1/2 inhibition increased cell death in the Hoechst-positive (Hst(+)), low pyronin Y (PY)-staining (2N Hst(+)/PY(-)) G(0) population and in sorted small side-population (SSP) MM cells. These findings provide evidence that cytokinetically quiescent MM cells are highly susceptible to simultaneous Chk1 and MEK1/2 inhibition.",

This study represents the first quantitative multi-nuclear (((1))H and ((19))F) fast magnetic resonance imaging study of the complete dissolution process of a commercial (Lescol\u00ae XL) tablet, whose formulation is based on the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) polymer under in vitro conditions in a standard USP-IV (United States Pharmacopeia apparatus IV) flow-through cell that is incorporated into high field superconducting magnetic resonance spectrometer. Quantitative RARE ((1))H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ((19))F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and imaging methods have been used to give information on: (i) dissolution media uptake and hydrodynamics; (ii) active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) mobilisation and dissolution; (iii) matrix swelling and dissolution and (iv) media activity within the swelling matrix. In order to better reflect the in vivo conditions, the bio-relevant media Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF) and Fasted State Simulated Intestinal Fluid (FaSSIF) were used. A newly developed quantitative ultra-fast MRI technique was applied and the results clearly show the transport dynamics of media penetration and hydrodynamics along with the polymer swelling processes. The drug dissolution and mobility inside the gel matrix was characterised, in parallel to the ((1))H measurements, by ((19))F NMR spectroscopy and MRI, and the drug release profile in the bulk solution was recorded offline by UV spectrometer. We found that NMR spectroscopy and 1D-MRI can be uniquely used to monitor the drug dissolution/mobilisation process within the gel layer, and the results from ((19))F NMR spectra indicate that in the gel layer, the physical mobility of the drug changes from \"dissolved immobilised drug\" to \"dissolved mobilised drug\".",

However, controversy remains over the pharmacologic effects and safety of these drugs, especially when used in combination therapies. This retrospective study evaluated the therapeutic effect and safety of simvastatin 20 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg combination therapy compared to simvastatin 20 mg or ezetimibe 10 mg monotherapy in Korean patients according to gender, age, baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and cardiovascular risk factors. We observed significant differences among patient subgroups. Simvastatin and ezetimibe monotherapies and combination therapy reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 27.6%, 10.1%, and 36.8% (p < 0.001) and total cholesterol levels by 17.5%, 9.2%, and 25.3% (p < 0.001), respectively. Both monotherapy and combination therapy groups had similar incidences of all types of adverse events. However, one case of rhabdomyolysis was observed in the combination therapy group. These results suggest that, compared to monotherapy, combination therapy has an additive effect that is not influenced by risk factors. Despite the low incidence of adverse events, caution is required when using these drugs, especially in the context of musculoskeletal side effects.", 
    "224": "Treatment of melanoma cells by sodium arsenite or statins (simvastatin and lovastatin) dramatically modified activities of the main cell signaling pathways resulting in the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and in a downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels. Through heme degradation and the production of carbon monoxide and biliverdin, HO-1 plays a protective role in different scenario of oxidative stress followed by mitochondrial apoptosis. Both sodium arsenite and statins could be efficient inducers of apoptosis in some melanoma cell lines, but often exhibited only modest proapoptotic activity in others, due to numerous protective mechanisms. We demonstrated in the present study that treatment by sodium arsenite or statins with an additional inhibition of HO-1 expression (or activation) caused a substantial upregulation of apoptosis in melanoma cells. Sodium arsenite- or statin-induced apoptosis was independent of BRAF status (wild type versus V600E) in melanoma lines. Monotreatment required high doses of statins (20-40 \u03bcM) for effective induction of apoptosis. As an alternative approach, pretreatment of melanoma cells with statin at decreased doses (5-20 \u03bcM) dramatically enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis, due to suppression of the NF-\u03baB and STAT3-transcriptional targets (including COX-2) and downregulation of cFLIP-L (a caspase-8 inhibitor) protein levels. Furthermore, combined treatment with sodium arsenite and TRAIL or simvastatin and TRAIL efficiently induced apoptotic commitment in human neuroblastoma cells. In summary, our findings on enhancing effects of combined treatment of cancer cells using statin and TRAIL provide the rationale for further preclinical evaluation.", 
    "225": "Intestinal deformity and stenosis are induced by fibrosis during the process healing of intestinal chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Potent anti-inflammatory treatment of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) may induce fibrous stenosis, and this is often difficult to treat in clinical practice. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a treatment strategy that concomitantly exhibits repair/regenerative and anti-fibrotic effects, in addition to the current anti-inflammatory effect, for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the relationship between the course of inflammatory activity and the healing process and fibrogenesis has not been elucidated; although the complex involvement of various factors in the mechanism of biological fibrosis has been investigated. Simvastatin (SIMV), an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects.

    "246": "Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9), also called thiolase II, condenses two molecules of acetyl-CoA to give acetoacetyl-CoA. This is the first enzymatic step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids via mevalonate (MVA). In this work, thiolase II from alfalfa (MsAACT1) was identified and cloned. The enzymatic activity was experimentally demonstrated in planta and in heterologous systems. The condensation reaction by MsAACT1 was proved to be inhibited by CoA suggesting a negative feedback regulation of isoprenoid production. Real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that MsAACT1 expression is highly increased in roots and leaves under cold and salinity stress. Treatment with mevastatin, a specific inhibitor of the MVA pathway, resulted in a decrease in squalene production, antioxidant activity, and the survival of stressed plants. As expected, the presence of mevastatin did not change chlorophyll and carotenoid levels, isoprenoids synthesized via the plastidial MVA-independent pathway. The addition of vitamin C suppressed the sensitive phenotype of plants challenged with mevastatin, suggesting a critical function of the MVA pathway in abiotic stress-inducible antioxidant defence. MsAACT1 over-expressing transgenic plants showed salinity tolerance comparable with empty vector transformed plants and enhanced production of squalene without altering the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) activity in salt-stress conditions. Thus, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase is a regulatory enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis involved in abiotic stress adaptation.",

Minimal side effects were evident, and no child experienced dose-limiting toxicity. Cognitive evaluations were completed before and after treatment, and the results suggested improvement in areas of verbal and nonverbal memory. Additional analyses, using reliable change indices, indicated improvements exceeding those of test-retest or practice effects in some participants. These observations may be analogous to the improvements observed in a neurofibromatosis type 1 murine model treated with lovastatin, although further study and replication are required. The safety and preliminary cognitive results support the need for a larger phase II trial in this population.",

A careful assessment of thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of amorphous form is necessary for successful use of amorphous form in drug delivery. The present study was undertaken to evaluate effect of monovalent sodium (Na(+); ATV Na), and bivalent calcium (Ca(2+); ATV Ca) and magnesium (Mg(2+); ATV Mg) counterions on properties of amorphous salts of atorvastatin (ATV) model drug. Amorphous form was generated from crystalline salts of ATV by spray drying, and characterized for glass transition temperature (T(g)), fragility and devitrification tendency. In addition, chemical stability of the amorphous salt forms was evaluated. Fragility was studied by calculating activation enthalpy for structural relaxation at T(g), from heating rate dependency of T(g). Density functional theory and relative pK(a)'s of counterions were evaluated to substantiate trend in glass transition temperature. T(g) of salts followed order: ATV Ca>ATV Mg>ATV Na. All salts were fragile to moderately fragile, with D value ranging between 9 and 16. Ease of devitrification followed the order: ATV Na\u223cATV Mg\u226bATV Ca, using isothermal crystallization and reduced crystallization temperature method. Chemical stability at 80\u00b0C showed higher degradation of amorphous ATV Ca (\u223c5%), while ATV Na and ATV Mg showed degradation of 1-2%. Overall, ATV Ca was better in terms of glass forming ability, higher T(g) and physical stability. The study has importance in selection of a suitable amorphous form, during early drug development phase."
