Individuals with elevated ratio (\"high absorbers\") have less favourable cholesterol-lowering response and cardiovascular protection with statin therapy as compared to individuals with low ratio (\"high synthesizers\").

Despite extensive research on anti-thrombotic effect of statins, little is known about their effects on TF and PAI-1 expression in glomerular mesangial cells under hypercholesterolemic condition. Male rabbits were fed on either normal or high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks. Then cholesterol-fed rabbits were randomly assigned to simvastatin or starch. At the end of 12 weeks, glomerular mesangial cells were collected. The concentrations of TF and PAI-1 mRNA were detected by RT-PCR. The plasma activities of TF and PAI-1 were determined with enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chromogenic substrate method, respectively. The atherogenic diet caused a consistent increase in serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and serum triglyceride (TG) (p < 0.05), increased TF and PAI-1 mRNA expression in glomerular mesangial cells and plasma activities as compared to the normal diet (p < 0.01). Four-week simvastatin treatment resulted in significant decrease of mesangial TF and PAI-1 mRNA (p < 0.01), and also of the plasma activities of TF (p < 0.05) and PAI-1 (p < 0.01). These results suggest that simvastatin might protect kidney from the formation of microthrombus under hypercholesterolemic condition and might be a possible pathogenesis of obesity-related glomerulopathy.",

While it seems reasonable to suspect that dyslipidemia and its treatment in ESRD patients will affect CV morbidity and mortality similar to that in the general population, recent studies have suggested that this may not be the case. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics of lipid lowering drugs are altered in patients with ESRD and must be considered when treating this group of patients. This article reviews the major classes of drugs used to treat dyslipidemia, emphasizing their role in patients with ESRD.", 
    "12": "Recent clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to very low levels will substantially reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The lipid-lowering agents of choice are the statins, which are generally considered safe and effective. Of the various agents available, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are the most powerful, followed by simvastatin. Serious adverse effects with statin therapy are uncommon and primarily involve effects on the liver and skeletal muscle. The risk increases with the statin dose and coadministration with other drugs metabolized by the same metabolic pathway, such as the cytochrome P-450 system. For patients who do not achieve adequate reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with statin therapy of moderate potency, the clinician can up-titrate the dose of the initial statin, institute combination therapy and carefully monitor for adverse effects, or switch to a lower dose of a more potent statin. The strategy chosen depends on the degree of lipid lowering required and on safety, cost, and compliance issues.

However, studies of ABCB1 genotype or haplotype and PGP expression, activity or drug response have produced inconsistent results. This critical review of ABCB1 genotype and PGP function, including mRNA expression, PGP-substrate drug pharmacokinetics and drug response, highlights methodological limitations of existing studies, including inadequate power, potential confounding by co-morbidity and co-medication, multiple testing, poor definition of disease phenotype and outcomes, and analysis of multiple drugs that might not be PGP substrates.

HAART exhibits significant side effects, however, such as hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia, which possibly contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in HAART-treated patients. In addition, direct effects of HAART on vascular cells have been described, which may promote atherosclerotic lesion formation. The effects of HAART on balloon-induced neointima formation have not been studied previously. The rat carotid artery balloon model was used to evaluate the effects of HAART (lopinavir, ritonavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine) on neointima formation and endothelial recovery. Furthermore, the effects of concomitant administration of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin were investigated. HAART-treated animals displayed an increase in lesion size (neointima/media ratio: 1.14 +/- 0.32 vs. 1.31 +/- 0.20 in control vs. HAART; P < 0.05) and an impaired regenerative capacity of the endothelium, as indicated by reduction in endothelial regrowth from an adjacent undilated vessel segment 14 days after injury (re-endothelialization area: 8.29 +/- 1.45 mm vs. 5.09 +/- 0.53 mm in control vs. HAART; P < 0.05). When rosuvastatin was given in addition to HAART, these effects were not observed. In conclusion, HAART inhibited endothelial cell-mediated healing and promoted neointima formation after angioplasty in rats. These deleterious effects were attenuated by cotreatment with rosuvastatin, however. Our studies suggest that currently used drug regimens against HIV infection may lead to an increased risk for restenosis after percutaneous vascular interventions. Moreover, the findings indicate that the additional treatment with statins might counteract these adverse effects by HAART.",

This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial with three treatment arms (each 2 months) and two washout periods (each 2 months). Fifty patients with type 2 diabetes were given simvastatin 20 mg and placebo, simvastatin 20 mg and ramipril 10 mg, or ramipril 10 mg and placebo daily during each treatment period.

However, a functional polymorphism in the promoter of the eNOS gene (T-786C) reduces its activity and could modulate the response to statins. Here, we examined whether this polymorphism modulates the effects of atorvastatin on the plasma levels of markers of NO formation and oxidative stress. We genotyped 200 healthy subjects for this polymorphism, and 15 subjects with the TT genotype and 15 with the CC genotype were selected to receive placebo or atorvastatin 10 mg/day po for 14 days. To assess NO bioavailability, the plasma concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, and cGMP and the whole blood nitrite concentrations were determined after placebo or atorvastatin using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay and an enzyme immunoassay. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBA-RS) were measured in the plasma to assess oxidative stress. Atorvastatin decreased cholesterol concentrations independent of genotype. Whereas atorvastatin produced no significant changes in plasma nitrite, nitrate, or cGMP concentrations in both genotype groups, atorvastatin increased whole blood nitrite concentrations and decreased plasma TBA-RS concentrations in the CC (but not in the TT) genotype group. These findings suggest that the T-786C polymorphism modulates the effects of atorvastatin on NO bioavailability and oxidative stress.",

Transfection of VSMC with wild-type and dominant-negative ILK cDNA constructs revealed that ILK mediates migration and proliferation of VSMC but has no effect on VSMC survival. The pro-atherogenic mediator angiotensin II increases ILK protein expression and kinase activity while statin treatment down-regulates ILK in VSMC. Functionally, ILK is necessary for angiotensin II-mediated VSMC migration and proliferation. In VSMC transduced with dominant-negative ILK, statins mediate an additive inhibition of VSMC migration and proliferation, while transfection with wild-type ILK is sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effects of statin treatment on VSMC migration and proliferation. In vivo, ILK is expressed in VSMC of aortic sections from wild-type mice where it is down-regulated following statin treatment and up-regulated following induction of atherosclerosis in apoE-/- mice. These data identify ILK as a novel target in VSMC for anti-atherosclerotic therapy.", 
    "45": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are the most successful cardiovascular drugs of all time. By interrupting cholesterol synthesis in the liver, they activate hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and produce consistent and predictable reductions in circulating LDL cholesterol with resulting reproducible improvements in cardiovascular risk by retarding or even regressing the march of atherosclerosis in all major arterial trees (coronary, cerebral and peripheral). Clinical trials have demonstrated their capacity not only to extend life, but also to improve its quality by retarding the progression of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease and by enhancing central and peripheral blood flow. They are amongst the most extensively investigated pharmaceutical agents in current clinical use. In cardiovascular end-point trials they have proven ability to help prevent that first and all important myocardial infarction and to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence in those who do succumb. They are equally effective in men and women of all ages and at all levels of cardiovascular risk, whether caused by hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus or the metabolic syndrome. In addition, they improve the outlook of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia whose LDL receptor function is deficient or defective; and all of this comes at minimal risk to the recipient. Their most important potential side effect is myopathy, which on very rare occasions may lead to rhabdomyolysis. Clinical experience shows that myopathic symptoms with creatine kinase levels raised to more than 10 times the upper limit of normal is seen in <0.01% of recipients and progression to fatal rhabdomyolysis because of renal failure has been recorded in only 0.15 cases per million prescriptions. Liver function abnormalities are also, rarely, seen. Again, the frequency of raised aspartate or alanine aminotransferase to more than three times the normal limit is encountered in no more than 1-2% of all treated patients and is completely reversible upon withdrawal of treatment. Progression to hepatitis or liver failure does not occur.

Patients were well-matched in the 4 study groups at baseline for gender, weight, NYHA class and LVEF, however statin/bisoprolol patients were significantly younger (p < 0.05). Statin use at baseline was associated with a significant survival benefit compared with no statin use (p < 0.005, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.39-0.94). This benefit remained after adjusting for other significant predictors of survival (p < 0.05, HR = 0.60, 95%CI = 0.39-0.94). A significant interaction effect was noted with bisoprolol, survival being greatest in the statin/bisoprolol group (p < 0.001, HR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.03-0.60). Survival was 98.3% in the statin/bisoprolol group, 82.1% in the statin/placebo group, 87.2% in the no statin/bisoprolol group and 82.8% in the no statin/placebo group. The statin/bisoprolol group was also associated with fewer cardiovascular (p < 0.005) and sudden deaths (p < 0.0005) compared with other groups.", 
    "65": "Despite the post-hoc, non-randomised nature of this analysis, these observations suggest that statin use appears to be beneficial in CHF. Furthermore, there appears to be a favourable interaction between statins and beta-blockade within the Second Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study cohort. Prospective studies of statins are required to definitively address the role of these agents in established CHF.", 
    "66": "Statins are known to reduce high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations and improve endothelial function. However, whether statin withdrawal causes re-elevated concentrations of hs-CRP and von Willebrand Factor (vWF) (a marker of endothelial damage) remains unknown. We hypothesized that the concentrations of hs-CRP and vWF are substantially increased in patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP) and noticeably decreased following coronary stenting along with atorvastatin therapy. However, re-elevations of these biomarker concentrations occurred once again after withdrawing atorvastatin therapy. We serially examined the plasma concentrations of hs-CRP and vWF in 51 patients with UAP before (day 0) and after (days 21, 90, 180, 270) performing coronary artery stenting. The concentrations of these 2 biomarkers were also measured in 30 healthy control subjects. Patients were treated with atorvastatin (40 mg/day orally) for 180 days, after which the therapy was withdrawn. The hs-CRP and vWF concentrations were significantly higher in the patients than in the healthy control subjects before the procedure (both P values < 0.001). The hs-CRP concentration decreased significantly on day 21 (P < 0.001), and further to a substantially lower level on day 180 (P < 0.0001). However, the hs-CRP level significantly increased again on day 270, as compared with that on day 180 (P < 0.001). The vWF plasma concentration decreased gradually to a significantly lower level on day 180. The concentration of this biomarker did not differ between days 180 and 270. In conclusion, although hs-CRP concentrations decreased markedly following combined stenting and atorvastatin therapy, re-elevation after atorvastatin therapy was withdrawn in UAP patients undergoing coronary stenting was not observed. Conversely, restoration of endothelial function was slow and persistent in these patients.", 
    "67": "The use and adherence to statin therapy in American Indians and Alaska Natives with coronary artery disease (CAD) were studied.", 
    "68": "A retrospective database analysis of the Phoenix Area of the Indian Health Service was conducted. For the cohort of patients with CAD, prescription data were obtained for all statins during calendar year 2003. Use was determined by the presence of at least one statin prescription, whereas adherence was assessed using the medication possession ratio (MPR), persistence, and median gap.", 
    "69": "The study cohort was composed of 2095 adults (55.6% men) with at least one medical encounter for CAD during calendar year 2002. The mean +/- S.D. age of the cohort was 62.7 +/- 12.7 years. At least one prescription for any statin drug during 2003 was found for 865 (41.3%) patients. Those who received a statin were more likely to be male, be younger than 80 years, and have a greater number of medical visits. The mean MPR was 0.78 +/- 0.25, and nonadherence was found in approximately 40% of patients receiving statins. In the age category of 65-79 years, men were more adherent than women, and patients in this category were overall more adherent than younger patients.", 
    "70": "The use of statins in a cohort of American Indians and Alaska Natives at high risk for cardiovascular events was approximately 40% with a 60% adherence rate. Age, sex, and number of medical visits were associated with statin use, and age and sex were associated with adherence.", 
    "71": "Cardiac surgery is increasingly performed on elderly patients with extensive coronary artery abnormalities who have impaired left ventricular function, decreased physiologic reserve, and multiple comorbid conditions. Considerable numbers of these patients develop perioperative neurologic complications ranging from subtle cognitive dysfunction to more evident postoperative confusion, delirium, and, less commonly, clinically apparent stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have elucidated that a considerable number of patients have new ischemic brain infarcts, particularly after conventional coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Mechanisms of cerebral injury during and after cardiac surgery are discussed. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and epiaortic scanning for detection of atheromatous disease of the proximal thoracic aorta is paramount in identifying patients at high risk from neurologic injury. It is important to recognize that our efforts to minimize neurologic injury should not be limited to the intraoperative period. Particular efforts should be directed to temperature management, glycemia control, and pharmacologic neuroprotection extending into the postoperative period. Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography may be of value for screening patients with significant atheroma of the proximal thoracic aorta. It is likely that for patients with no significant atheromatous disease, conventional coronary artery revascularization is the most effective long-term strategy, whereas patients with atheromatous thoracic aorta may be better managed with beating heart surgery, hybrid techniques, or medical therapy alone. Patient stratification based on the aortic atheromatic burden should be addressed in future trials designed to tailor treatment strategies to improve long-term outcomes of coronary heart disease and reduce the risks of perioperative neurologic injury.", 
    "72": "Patients with peripheral vascular disease are less likely to receive optimal medical management than patients with coronary artery disease. However, early medical treatment is critical because it is profoundly beneficial and the benefits are maximized. Even in patients with advanced disease requiring invasive intervention, medical management has been proven to improve outcome, prolong the success of the intervention, improve functional capacity, and prolong life. The vascular surgeon should be knowledgeable enough to initiate basic medical therapy and to define for their patients the goals that need to be met to optimize their medical management. The vascular surgeon should be instrumental in assuring that the peripheral vascular patient receives medical therapy of the same standard as the patient with coronary disease. The major modifiable risk factors in the vascular patient are: smoking, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes. In addition, the use of beta blockers for patients with coronary disease and antiplatelet therapy as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are recommended for all patients with peripheral vascular disease. Statins have favorable effects on multiple interrelated aspects of vascular biology important in atherosclerosis. In particular they have beneficial effects on inflammation, plaque stabilization, endothelial dysfunction, and thrombosis. Statins have also been shown to be beneficial in acute vascular events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with peripheral arterial disease regardless of the presence or absence of hypertension. A number of the pleiotropic effects of statins are shared by ACE inhibitors. In summary, patients with known vascular disease should be treated aggressively with a combination of a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an antiplatelet agent and a beta blocker if there is a history of coronary disease. They should also receive tight control of their blood pressure and blood sugar. Smokers should be encouraged to stop smoking and should be provided with pharmaceutical and emotional support by their physicians. All of these patients should have their body mass index as close to normal as possible and be on a therapeutic lifestyle diet. Regular aerobic exercise is also indicated. Patients with symptomatic claudication should be considered for cilostazol. Patients with multiple risk factors for vascular disease, but who do not have documented disease should also be on statin therapy. As more studies define the linear relationship between lower LDL-C levels and lowered risk of vascular events, indicating that the lower the LDL-C level, the lower the risk, experts are advocating more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy. In patients with peripheral arterial disease, some experts now advocate lowering the goal of LDL therapy to 70 mg/dL.", 
    "73": "Atherosclerosis is a progressive process that initially involves endothelial dysfunction. We investigated the effects of atorvastatin on both lipid parameters, and VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression in apoE-deficient or wild type C57BL/6J mice.", 
    "74": "The C57BL/6J mice were fed with either chow or an atherogenic diet for 12 weeks. Male apoE-deficient mice were fed with the chow diet for 12 weeks. In 3 atorvastatin treated groups mice were fed the same diet as described above except atorvastatin was added to the diet at the dosage of 10 mg/kg per day for the last 8 weeks before euthanasia.", 
    "75": "Biochemical analysis showed that atorvastatin significantly decreased total cholesterol levels and VLDL in C57BL/6J mice fed with atherogenic diet but increased serum lipid levels in apoE-deficient mice. Stereological analysis of the immunohistochemical staining revealed that atorvastatin reduced endothelial expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 only in C57BL/6J mice on chow diet.", 
    "76": "We have demonstrated that endothelial expression of both VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 does not correlate with cholesterol levels in these mice. Moreover, we showed that 8-week administration of atorvastatin decrease endothelial expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in C57BL/6J wild type mice beyond its lipid lowering effect but not in C57BL/6J wild type mice fed by atherogenic diet or in apoE-deficient mice.", 
    "77": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors) inhibit the rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway, conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, by competitive inhibition with the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Statins not only lower cholesterol levels, but are also thought to exert neuroprotective and neurogenic effects that may be beneficial in treating brain and spinal cord injuries. Data presented here illustrate that simvastatin enables neurite outgrowth in the presence of growth-inhibitory molecules commonly found at central nervous system (CNS) injury sites. To assess the effect of simvastatin on neurite outgrowth in the presence of inhibitory molecules present at CNS injury sites, rat embryonic cortex explants or postnatal spinal cord explants were grown on membrane filters prepared with alternating stripes of laminin and myelin/laminin. Immunostaining indicated that myelin stripes contain myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp), and Nogo, but do not contain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG). When control explants were grown in the presence of alternating stripes, neurite outgrowth preferentially extended in regions containing laminin only. In contrast, neurite outgrowth from explants grown in the presence of simvastatin was significantly less selective for laminin regions and was able to extend into regions containing myelin (p < 0.01). Simvastatin-induced effects were reversed by addition of mevalonate. Isoprenyl transferase inhibitors GGTI-286 and FTI-277, inhibitors of biochemical steps subsequent to HMG-CoA conversion to mevalonate, mimicked simvastatin- induced effects. These data suggest that simvastatin counteracts myelin-associated neurite outgrowth inhibition signals via mevalonate pathway inhibition, and may be beneficial in promoting axon regeneration in brain and spinal cord injury.", 
    "78": "The prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) involves therapeutic lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation, diet, weight reduction and exercise. In patients with established CAD or atherosclerosis in other vascular beds, or in patients at high risk of developing CAD, lowering serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been associated with a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and total mortality. Recently, large-scale studies have shown that lowering the LDL-C to less than 2.0 mmol/L is associated with a reduction of major cardiac events in patients with established CAD. Therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has had a major impact on preventive cardiology. Not all patients reach recommended LDL-C targets on currently available statins. Ezetimibe is a selective inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption that results in an additional 15% to 25% reduction of LDL-C. The recommended dosage is 10 mg once daily; it is safe and well tolerated. Elevations in transaminase and creatine kinase occur in approximately 1% of subjects. Ezetimibe is suggested for patients who do not reach recommended LDL-C targets on an optimal dosage of statins alone. While the effects of ezetimibe on atherosclerosis have not been ascertained, clinical trials have consistently shown that the reduction in serum cholesterol correlates with a decrease in major cardiovascular events, irrespective of the method used to reduce cholesterol.", 
    "79": "Recent clinical trials have indicated that lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels below currently recommended targets results in favourable surrogate and clinical end points. The Treating to New Targets (TNT) study now confirms that aggressive cholesterol lowering to a mean LDL-C of 2.0 mmol/L with atorvastatin 80 mg daily, compared with the previous target of 2.5 mmol/L with atorvastatin 10 mg daily, results in improved clinical outcomes in high-risk patients with coronary artery disease. A lower LDL-C target of less than 2.0 mmol/L will present therapeutic challenges, because approximately only one-half of high-risk patients will achieve this target using monotherapy with the newer and more powerful statins. Furthermore, registry data show that one-half of these patients are not even achieving the current LDL-C target of 2.5 mmol/L. Causes of the care gap are discussed and possible remedies to achieve the new lower targets are suggested.", 
    "80": "The most recent guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program recommend more aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals: <100 mg/dL for patients at moderate or high risk of cardiovascular disease, and <70 mg/dL for patients at very high risk. These lower goals are more likely to be achieved using the more powerful statins--atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin. Although statins are widely used, extensively studied, and known to have an excellent safety profile, the perception of many health care providers and patients is that safety concerns about the more efficacious statins, especially at high doses, limit their use. However, clinical data consistently support the view that adverse events are uncommon even when intensive therapy is used to reach aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. Overall, the more potent statins have similar safety profiles. The benefits of aggressive statin treatment in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events appear to far outweigh any potential risks of adverse events.", 
    "81": "Statins do not always decrease coronary heart disease mortality, which was speculated based on increased serum plant sterols observed during statin treatment. To evaluate plant sterol atherogenicity, we fed low density lipoprotein-receptor deficient (LDLr(+/-)) mice for 35 weeks with Western diets (control) alone or enriched with atorvastatin or atorvastatin plus plant sterols or stanols. Atorvastatin decreased serum cholesterol by 22% and lesion area by 57%. Adding plant sterols or stanols to atorvastatin decreased serum cholesterol by 39% and 41%. Cholesterol-standardized serum plant sterol concentrations increased by 4- to 11-fold during sterol plus atorvastatin treatment versus stanol plus atorvastatin treatment. However, lesion size decreased similarly in the sterol plus atorvastatin (-99% vs. control) and the stanol plus atorvastatin (-98%) groups, with comparable serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that increased plant sterol concentrations are not atherogenic. Our second study confirms this conclusion. Compared with lesions after a 33 week atherogenic period, lesion size further increased in controls (+97%) during 12 more weeks on the diet, whereas 12 weeks with the addition of plant sterols or stanols decreased lesion size (66% and 64%). These findings indicate that in LDLr(+/-) mice 1) increased cholesterol-standardized serum plant sterol concentrations are not atherogenic, 2) adding plant sterols/stanols to atorvastatin further inhibits lesion formation, and 3) plant sterols/stanols inhibit the progression or even induce the regression of existing lesions.", 
    "82": "Although carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is now widely accepted as the surgical therapy for carotid stenosis, the role of and indications and evidence for many pharmacologic agents that are used adjunctively in the perioperative setting have not been conclusively established. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is the pharmaceutical agent that has been studied most extensively in conjunction with CEA; other than aspirin and dextran, the use of many agents before, during, and after CEA has not been standardized. Prospective randomized trials are still needed to demonstrate efficacy, predict outcome, and determine the optimal use of these medications in their adjunctive use during CEA to improve patient care and obtain optimal surgical outcomes.", 
    "83": "A sequential kinetic resolution catalyzed by halohydrin dehalogenase was employed for the synthesis of two valuable enantiopure building blocks. Resolution of methyl 4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate methylester ((R,S)-2) with use of a Trp249Phe mutant of halohydrin dehalogenase yielded methyl 4-cyano-3-hydroxybutanoate methylester ((S)-4) with 96.8% ee (40% yield) and (S)-2 with 95.2% ee (41% yield). This reaction is carried out in aqueous solution under mild conditions and provides access to a useful statin side-chain building block.", 
    "84": "Statin pharmaceuticals, heavily prescribed in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (HMGR). In plants, these compounds also inhibit HMGR, which regulates cytosolic isoprenoid biosynthesis in the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway. Phytotoxicity was evaluated in the higher aquatic plant Lemna gibba exposed to atorvastatin and lovastatin for 7-days by measuring the concentrations of sterols and ubiquinone; products downstream in the MVA pathway. The efficiency of the parallel and unaffected methylerythritol phosphate pathway (MEP) was also evaluated by measuring the end product, plastoquinone. Statin treatment caused an accumulation of plastoquinone, and unexpectedly, ubiquinone, an artifact likely due to metabolite sharing from the plastidial MEP pathway. Statins were, however, highly phytotoxic to L. gibba and HPLC-UV analysis of plant extracts showed significantly decreased concentrations of both stigmasterol and beta-sitosterol, which are critical components of plant membranes and regulate morphogenesis and development. EC10 values for atorvastatin and lovastatin were as small as 26.1 and 32.8 microg/L, respectively. However, hazard quotients indicated that statins present little risk to the model higher aquatic plant Lemna gibba at environmentally relevant concentrations, even though pathway-specific endpoints were 2-3 times more sensitive than traditional gross morphological endpoints typically used in risk assessment.", 
    "85": "Cardiovascular drugs such as lovastatin, simvastatin, amlodipine besylate, nifedipine, and hydralazine hydrochloride inhibit cholesterol esterase (CEase) in vitro. In the present paper, an attempt was made to determine kinetically the reaction mechanism for CEase inhibition by these drugs. The inhibition constant, Ki, for the mixed-type inhibition of CEase by these drugs in the presence of triton-X-100 or taurochloate were measured. Moreover, the pKi values were correlated with the molecular weights of these drugs. In conclusion, the fact that these drugs lower cholesterol levels in the plasma low-density lipoprotein may be partially due to the CEase inhibition by these drugs.", 
    "86": "Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) has been established on a series of thirty-eight compounds of four different sets of condensed pyridine and pyrimidine analogs, for their hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor activity, in order to understand the essential structural requirement for binding with receptor, in terms of common biophoric and secondary sites employing APEX-3D software. Among several 3D pharmacophoric models with different sizes and arrangements, one model was selected based on r2 = 0.8, chance<0.001, match equivalent to 0.38 and all the 38 compounds were considered. The results suggest that hydrophobicity, hydrogen acceptor and optimum steric refractivity play a dominant role in the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. The information obtained from the present study can be used to design and predict more potent molecules as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, prior to their synthesis.", 
    "87": "Insig-1 and Insig-2 are regulatory proteins that restrict the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway by preventing proteolytic activation of SREBPs and by enhancing degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Here, we created Insig-double-knockout (Insig-DKO) mice that are homozygous for null mutations in Insig-1 and Insig-2. After 18.5 days of development, 96% of Insig-DKO embryos had defects in midline facial development, ranging from cleft palate (52%) to complete cleft face (44%). Middle and inner ear structures were abnormal, but teeth and skeletons were normal. The animals were lethargic and runted; they died within 1 day of birth. The livers and heads of Insig-DKO embryos overproduced sterols, causing a marked buildup of sterol intermediates. Treatment of pregnant mice with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin reduced sterol synthesis in Insig-DKO embryos and reduced the pre-cholesterol intermediates. This treatment ameliorated the clefting syndrome so that 54% of Insig-DKO mice had normal faces, and only 7% had cleft faces. We conclude that buildup of pre-cholesterol sterol intermediates interferes with midline fusion of facial structures in mice. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of the cleft palate component of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and other human malformation syndromes in which mutations in enzymes catalyzing steps in cholesterol biosynthesis produce a buildup of sterol intermediates.", 
    "88": "Atherosclerosis is a lipid related chronic inflammatory disease in which immune mechanisms play a pivotal part. Its lesion is filled with large numbers of immune cells. In 1995 dendritic cells (DCs) were identified in atherosclerotic plaques and thought to play an important part in atherogenesis. DCs express MHCI and ll, HLA-DR, CD1a, ICAM-1 and VCAM1 on their surfaces, and this explains their unique ability to activate naive T cells. The risk factors for atherosclerosis are the factors for DCs' activation and migration. Mature DCs are capable of presenting antigen to T cells, which play an important part in progression of disease. Statin and diltiazem have been shown to protect endothelial function by suppressing the function of DCs and play an important part in preventing atherosclerosis.",

We compared outcomes between patients with DM (identified by history, fasting plasma glucose > or =126 mg/dL or haemoglobin A1C > 7%; n = 978) against those without DM (n = 3184). The rate of acute cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, and unstable angina requiring rehospitalization) was much higher in patients with DM, but was reduced with intensive vs. standard therapy similarly in diabetic (21.1 vs. 26.6%, HR = 0.75, P = 0.03) and non-diabetic patients (14.0 vs. 18.0%, HR = 0.76, P = 0.002); P-interaction = 0.97.

Over the four quarters post-policy implementation, however, this trend changed abruptly (p < 0.0001) with a decrease of 281 prescriptions per 100,000 people per quarter. This decrease was not restricted to prescriptions of 10 mg statins but was also observed for statin prescriptions of >or=20 mg. Several other cardiovascular medications displayed a similar trend as that observed in the number of statin prescriptions. This trend was not observed among non-cardiovascular control medications.", 
    "95": "Our study suggests that the policy allowing the OTC sale of 10 mg simvastatin has had a significant impact on statin prescriptions by general practitioners. However, this new policy may also be leading to less aggressive statin therapy. An alternative explanation for the observed decrease in statin prescriptions may be related to the unknown factors responsible for the overall decrease observed with other cardiovascular prescription drugs.", 
    "96": "The ideal chemopreventative agent, in addition to being efficacious in the prevention of cancer, must be easily administered, affordable, safe, and well tolerated, with minimal side effects. In the past decade, a growing body of literature has emerged on the prevention of CRC in patients with long-standing CD and UC. The data are not definitive and consist almost exclusively of retrospective case-control and cohort studies rather than the more rigorous prospective RCTs. 5-ASA compounds have been most thoroughly studied, and most of the existing data support the use of 5-ASA in the prevention of CRC. Although the precise dose and duration are unclear, studies suggest that chronic systemic administration of 5-ASA at a dose of at least 1.2 g/d is most likely to be effective. A beneficial effect of folate, albeit not statistically significant, has been consistently shown in every study performed for this purpose. Folate supplementation, which is safe and affordable, should also be recommended for all patients with IBD, especially those taking sulfasalazine. UDCA has been shown to exert a protective effect in most studies on patients with UC and concomitant PSC. Because this patient population is at particularly high risk for CRC, it is advisable to consider UDCA in all patients with colitis complicated by PSC. For patients without PSC, sufficient data do not exist to recommend it for the purpose of cancer prevention. Five of the six corticosteroid studies have found a beneficial effect of systemic steroids, although most did not reach statistical significance. Regardless, given the frequent and serious adverse effects associated with chronic steroid use, systemic corticosteroids should not be prescribed for this indication. Budesonide, an oral corticosteroid with minimal systemic absorption, is a potential alternative, although it has not yet been studied as a chemopreventative agent. Similarly, until the long-term safety of chronic NSAID use can be demonstrated in patients with IBD, the role of NSAIDs in chemoprevention remains undefined. Although the data are conflicting, immune-modulating medications, such as AZA, do not seem to confer any reduction in the risk of dysplasia or CRC. The data on calcium supplementation and statin use are still too limited to endorse their use for the prevention of colitis-related CRC. Chemoprevention is an area that holds great promise in the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with IBD. Further studies, including prospective trials when possible and cost-effectiveness analyses, need to be performed to develop an optimal strategy for the reduction of cancer risk in patients with IBD.", 
    "97": "We have shown previously that lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl- glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, induces apoptosis in spontaneously immortalized rat brain neuroblasts. In the present study, we analysed the intracellular signal transduction pathways by which lovastatin induces neuroblast apoptosis. We showed that lovastatin efficiently inhibited Ras activation, which was associated with a significant decrease in ERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) phosphorylation. Lovastatin also decreased CREB phosphorylation and CREB-mediated gene expression. The effects of lovastatin on the Ras/ERK1/2/CREB pathway were time- and concentration-dependent and fully prevented by mevalonate. In addition, we showed that two MEK [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK kinase] inhibitors, PD98059 and PD184352, were poor inducers of apoptosis in serum-treated neuroblasts. However, these inhibitors significantly increased apoptosis induced by lovastatin treatment. Furthermore, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of both MEK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activities was able to induce neuroblast apoptosis with similar efficacy as lovastatin. Our results suggest that lovastatin triggers neuroblast apoptosis by regulating several signalling pathways, including the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway. These findings might also contribute to elucidate the intracellular mechanisms involved in the central nervous system side effects associated with statin therapy.",

Recently published data suggest that plasma lipoprotein(a) levels may affect the efficacy of statin therapy in patients with nephrotic syndrome. However, no data are available concerning the effect of lipoprotein(a) levels on the efficacy of statin therapy in patients with heterozygous FH.

We evaluated the effects of statins on breast cancer cell growth, phosphoprotein signaling intermediates, survival/apoptosis regulators, cell cycle regulators, and activated transcription factors. We also examined the in vivo effect of statin administration in a mouse ErbB2(+) breast cancer model. Only lipophilic statins had direct anticancer activity in vitro. Breast cancer cells with activated Ras or ErbB2 pathways seemed to be more sensitive than those overexpressing estrogen receptor, and this correlated with endogenous levels of activated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). Key intermediates regulating cell survival by NF-kappaB activation, as well as cell proliferation by the mitogen activated protein kinase cascade, were among the earliest phosphoproteins influenced by statin treatment. These early effects were followed by declines in activator protein-1 and NF-kappaB activation and concordant changes in other mediators of proliferation and apoptosis. In vivo results showed that oral dosing of statins significantly inhibited the growth of a mouse mammary carcinoma. Lipophilic statins can exert direct anticancer activity in vitro by reducing proliferation and survival signals in susceptible breast cancer phenotypes. Tumor growth inhibition in vivo using a clinically relevant statin dose also seems to be associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation and survival. These findings provide supporting rationale for future statin trials in breast cancer patients.",

    "105": "The effects of systemic administration of simvastatin on the retinal circulation after 90 minutes and after 7 days were studied in a placebo-controlled, double-masked, clinical trial among 12 healthy men. We used laser Doppler velocimetry to measure vessel diameter and blood velocity and calculated the blood flow in retinal arteries and veins. We also measured the intraocular pressure and the plasma nitrite/nitrate levels, the stable end products of nitric oxide metabolism.", 
    "106": "There were no significant changes in any retinal circulatory parameters at 90 minutes after administration of simvastatin. Daily administration of simvastatin for 7 days significantly increased blood velocity and blood flow in retinal arteries and veins but did not significantly change vessel diameter. The intraocular pressure significantly decreased at 90 minutes and at 7 days after administration of simvastatin. Simvastatin also significantly increased the plasma nitrite/nitrate levels.", 
    "107": "Simvastatin induced an increase in blood velocity and blood flow in retinal arteries and veins, increased the plasma nitrite/nitrate levels, and decreased the intraocular pressure, probably through the increase in nitric oxide.", 
    "108": "In a multicenter, open-label trial, 696 Hispanic patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > or =130 and < or =300 mg/dl and triglyceride levels <400 mg/dl at medium or high risk of coronary heart disease were randomized to receive 10 or 20 mg of rosuvastatin or 10 or 20 mg of atorvastatin for 6 weeks. At week 6, LDL cholesterol was decreased more by 10 mg of rosuvastatin than by 10 mg of atorvastatin (45% vs 36%, p <0.0001) and more by 20 mg of rosuvastatin than by 20 mg of atorvastatin (50% vs 42%, p <0.0001). Significantly greater decreases were also observed with rosuvastatin for total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein-B, and lipid ratios compared with milligram-equivalent doses of atorvastatin. Overall, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Program III LDL cholesterol goals were achieved by 78% and 88% of patients who received 10 and 20 mg of rosuvastatin and by 60% and 73% of patients who received 10 and 20 mg of atorvastatin, respectively. Among high-risk patients, the LDL cholesterol goal of <100 mg/dl was achieved by 74% and 91% of patients who received 10 and 20 mg of rosuvastatin and by 52% and 62% who received 10 and 20 mg of atorvastatin, respectively. All treatments were well tolerated, and adverse events were similar in frequency across treatment groups. No cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis were observed. In conclusion, treatment with rosuvastatin and atorvastatin produced beneficial lipid changes in this group of Hispanic patients that appear comparable in magnitude to those observed in primarily non-Hispanic white study populations. These benefits were accompanied by a favorable safety profile that suggests no concerns particular to this population.", 
    "109": "The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommends an algorithm to integrate iterative risk-stratification information with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels to identify candidates for statin therapy. We used the Aggrastat to Zocor (A to Z) trial, in which all patients presented with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event in the absence of previous statin therapy, to evaluate the performance of this algorithm. Of 1,750 patients with ACS included in this analysis, 1,126 (64%) had an indication for statin therapy before enrollment and 624 (36%) did not have a statin indication before enrollment. We estimate that initiating statin therapy at moderate dosages (decreasing LDL by 1 mmol/L) according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines would have prevented approximately 15% of the ACS events leading to enrollment in the A to Z trial, whereas more intensive statin therapy (decreasing LDL by 1.5 mmol/L) would have prevented >21% of events. Aspirin use before enrollment was reported in only 38% of subjects with a statin indication. In conclusion, these observations represent missed opportunities for primary and secondary prevention and highlight the need for assessment of patient risk and better adherence to existing prevention guidelines.", 
    "110": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol has protective cardiovascular effects. We investigated the effect of baseline HDL cholesterol on the outcomes of patients who underwent drug-eluting stent implantation for acute coronary syndrome. Since March 2003, 1,032 consecutive patients were, according to their baseline HDL cholesterol level, included in a low HDL cholesterol group (n = 550, <40 mg/dl in men, <45 mg/dl in women, mean 32 +/- 7) or a high HDL cholesterol group (n = 482, >40 mg/dl in men, >45 mg/dl in women, mean 55 +/- 19). End points were death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization, and a composite of major adverse cardiac events at 30 days and 1 year. We assessed the relation between HDL cholesterol and end points. Patients with low HDL cholesterol more often had diabetes, a higher body mass index, higher triglyceride levels, and lower total cholesterol levels. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and statin treatment (98% in the 2 groups) were comparable. Incidences of mortality and major adverse cardiac events at 30 days were higher in the low than in the high HDL cholesterol group (p <0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively; chi-square analysis). At 1 year, more deaths occurred in the low HDL cholesterol group (p <0.001; chi-square analysis), as did major adverse cardiac events (p <0.001; chi-square analysis). Multivariate analysis showed low HDL cholesterol at baseline (hazard ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 5.12) to be a key predictor of major adverse cardiac events and death (hazard ratio 3.33, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 10.0) at 1 year. In conclusion, regardless of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and statin therapy, additional strategies to increase HDL cholesterol should be evaluated in patients with acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "111": "Inflammatory conditions reduce the potency to prolong the PR interval of certain cardiovascular drugs including propranolol, sotalol, and verapamil in rats and humans despite elevated plasma drug concentrations. We tested whether pravastatin restores altered action and disposition of propranolol as well as inflammatory mediators concentrations in the Pre-Adjuvant Arthritis (Pre-AA) Sprague-Dawley rat model. Rats [Healthy/Placebo, Arthritis/Placebo, Healthy/Statin, and Arthritis/Statin groups (n=14-16/group)] received Mycobacterium butyricum on day 0 followed by 6 mg/kg pravastatin or placebo twice daily during days 4-8. PR-interval response to 25 mg/kg oral propranolol was measured on days 0, 4 and 8. On day 8, blood samples were collected for interferon-gamma, interleukin-10, C-reactive protein, and nitrite measurements. Propranolol enantiomer pharmacokinetics were delineated using another 4 groups (healthy n=5, Pre-AA n=9) on day 8. Pre-AA significantly reduced propranolol response despite a 10-fold increase in concentrations. Pravastatin restored the response but not the drug concentrations. Area under the % effect-time curve (% min) was 714+/-214 in Healthy/Placebo, 256+/-249 in Arthritis/Placebo, 1534+/-367 in Healthy/Statin, and 1713+/-393 in Arthritis/Statin. While pravastatin reduced elevated serum interferon-gamma concentration in the Pre-AA model, it did not influence other biomarkers. Pravastatin restores response to propranolol in inflamed rat but has no effect on the elevated propranolol concentrations. This was associated with lower serum interferon-gamma concentrations.",

    "117": "The aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo the antiproliferative effect of an inhibitor of isoprenoids metabolism, lovastatin, in an experimental model of propylthiouracil-induced goiter. In thyroid cells, thyrotropin (TSH)-induced proliferation requires active isoprenoid synthesis, and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have antiproliferative effects in vitro. Propylthiouracil treatment (PTU) of rats led to thyroid hypertrophy and hyperplasia by TSH-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Immunohistochemistry showed an increased number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells in the thyroid gland of PTU-treated rats. Moreover, the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was increased in the extract from goiter tissue as compared with the thyroid tissue of untreated rats. To determine whether the inhibition of selected pro-survival pathways (i.e., p21ras-MAPK) was sufficient to affect goitrogenesis, thyroids from 12 PTU-treated rats were injected in vivo with an adenovirus transducing a dominant-negative ras gene (Rad-L61.S186) and another set of 12 rats were injected with a pharmacological inhibitor of MAPK (PD98059). Both Rad-L61.S186 and PD98059 were able to inhibit the PTU-induced goiter. It is interesting to note that lovastatin, when administered in drinking water, significantly prevented the thyroid gland enlargement. Therefore, lovastatin-treated thyroid glands were significantly smaller than those treated with PTU alone. In addition, the lovastatin-treated glands also showed a decreased expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and a number of PCNA-positive cells. Our data suggest that lovastatin is an efficient inhibitor of goitrogenesis and provide a rationale for innovative therapeutic strategies employing statins in the treatment of nodular goiter in humans.", 
    "118": "It is unclear whether the reduction of coronary restenosis by statins is due to a decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and/or pleiotropic effects. Therefore, we performed quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and analyzed the lipid profile and changes in adhesion molecules and chemokines caused by statin in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).", 
    "119": "The subjects included AMI patients who had initial coronary angiograms and significant coronary stenosis and were implanted with a stent. After stent implantation, patients were treated either with (n = 36) or without (n = 14) statin. The primary end-point for this study was the absolute changes in the lipid profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), adhesion molecules, chemokines and stenosis measured by QCA between the post-stent and follow-up angiogram at 6 months after stenting.", 
    "120": "Treatment with statin reduced % coronary diameter stenosis (DS) and was associated with a greater reduction in LDL cholesterol at 6 months after stenting in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), while there were no differences in adhesion molecules, chemokines, CC chemokine receptor or CXC chemokine receptor. Interestingly, changes in % DS between before and after statin treatment at 6 months (Delta%DS) were positively correlated with DeltaLDL cholesterol, and patients who had an LDL cholesterol level of less than 80 mg/dl had a significantly lower Delta%DS. In addition, Delta%DS was significantly related only to the reduction in LDL cholesterol as assessed by a stepwise multivariable regression analysis.",

    "122": "Cholesterol synthesis in animal cells is regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-2. The objective of this study was to investigate whether activation of peroxisome proliferator-activatedreceptor (PPAR)-gamma influences the SREBP-2 dependent cholesterol synthesis in liver and intestinal cells. Therefore, HepG2 and Caco-2 cells were incubated with and without 10 or 30 microM of troglitazone, a synthetic PPAR gamma agonist, for 4 hrs. Incubation with 10 or 30 microM of troglitazone caused a significant, dose-dependent reduction of cholesterol synthesis in both HepG2 and Caco-2 cells (P < 0.05). HepG2 and Caco-2 cells incubated with 10 or 30 microM of troglitazone had also lower mRNA concentrations and lower nuclear protein concentrations of SREBP-2 than untreated control cells (P < 0.05). mRNA concentrations of the SREBP-2 target genes HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor were also reduced in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells treated with 30 microM of troglitazone compared to control cells (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study shows that PPAR gamma activation by troglitazone lowers the cholesterol synthesis in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells by reducing the concentration of nuclear SREBP-2 and successive downregulation of its target genes involved in cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "123": "Statins reduce the risk for myocardial infarctions and stroke which may in part depend on cholesterol-independent (pleiotropic) vasoprotective effects. Here, we review evidence to suggest that the abrupt discontinuation of statin medication exerts negative vascular effects in patients with acute vascular events.", 
    "124": "It is increasingly recognized that statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) exert rapid cholesterol-independent effects. Cessation of statin treatment confers overshoot activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins Rho and Rac causing production of reactive oxygen species and suppression of NO bioavailability. In humans, discontinuation of statin therapy leads to a proinflammatory, prothrombotic state with impaired endothelium function. In patients with acute coronary syndromes, abrupt discontinuation of statin therapy significantly increases morbidity and mortality, whereas in stable vascular patients discontinuation may be safe. Recent prospective data indicated that the cessation of statin medication in acute ischemic stroke patients confers a significantly higher likelihood of early neurological deterioration and poor outcome.", 
    "125": "We propose that in all acute ischemic stroke patients chronically treated with statins before the event, treatment should be continued and the patient should receive medication at the day of the stroke.", 
    "126": "The transcription factor KLF2 is considered an important mediator of the anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties of the endothelium. KLF2 is absent from low-shear, atherosclerosis-prone sites of the vascular tree but is induced by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in vitro. We studied KLF2-dependent induction of important determinants of the atheroprotective status of the endothelium to determine whether pharmacological intervention, e.g. by statins, can potentially replace shear stress.", 
    "127": "Shear stress and statin effects in combination with TNF-alpha were determined in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by quantitative measurements of the steady-state levels and stability of mRNA for KLF2 and its downstream target genes thrombomodulin (TM) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).", 
    "128": "We demonstrate that prolonged shear stress has a potential that is superior to that of statins to induce the KLF2-dependent expression of eNOS and TM, especially in the presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). These effects can be attributed to the sustained stabilization of KLF2 mRNA by shear, leading to an increased KLF2 protein expression and concomitant strong induction of KLF2 downstream targets. The stabilization of KLF2 mRNA is demonstrated to be dependent on signaling involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K).", 
    "129": "The stabilization of KLF2 steady-state levels, as induced by prolonged shear stress but not by statins, may be essential for sustaining the quiescent, atheroprotective status of the vascular endothelium under inflammatory conditions.", 
    "130": "Amyloid containing senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are histologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Interestingly the SP and NFT found in non-demented, age-matched individuals with ischemic heart disease and/or hypertension are morphologically and topographically identical to those in AD. Cholesterol plays a significant role in production and accumulation of amyloid beta (Abeta) and progression of AD. Cholesterol is also a major contributor in atherosclerotic changes and cardiovascular disease. Numerous studies acknowledged benefits of cholesterol-lowering statins in slowing down the progression of AD, improving cognitive status and significantly reducing risk of cardiovascular events. Accumulating evidence suggests that there is a chronic inflammatory reaction in the areas of the brain affected by AD and C-reactive protein (CRP) is identified as a key molecule of acute phase of inflammation. CRP is also a very sensitive marker for cardiovascular events and excellent prognostic tool in post-heart attack and post-coronary artery bypass surgery recovery. Here we report that cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin produces no significant change in CRP levels in treating AD patients who participated in ADCLT (AD cholesterol lowering trial).", 
    "131": "Atorvastatin is insoluble in aqueous solution and the bioavailability after oral administration is low. Self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) containing atorvastatin have been successfully prepared to improve its bioavailability. SMEDDS is a mixture of lipid, surfactant, and cosurfactant, which are emulsified in aqueous medium under gentle digestive motility in the gastrointestinal tract. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams composed of various excipients were plotted. Droplet size, zeta-potential and long-term physical stability of the formulations were investigated. The release of atorvastatin from SMEDDS capsules was studied using the dialysis bag method in 0.1 M HCl and phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), compared with the release of atorvastatin from a conventional tablet. A pharmacokinetic study was performed in 6 beagle dogs after oral administration of 6 mg kg-1 atorvastatin. The bioavailability of atorvastatin SMEDDS capsules was significantly increased compared with that of the conventional tablet. SMEDDS capsules consisting of Labrafil, propylene glycol and Cremophor RH40 provided the greatest bioavailability. Our studies indicate that the use of SMEDDS for the delivery of atorvastatin can improve its bioavailability.", 
    "132": "Retrospective analyses of data from the Platelet Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management (PRISM), the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 4, and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) trials revealed that the benefits of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) on acute coronary outcomes are rapidly lost and outcomes worsened if statins are discontinued during a patient's hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome. Withdrawal of statin therapy in the first 24 hours of hospitalization for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction increased the hospital morbidity and mortality rate versus continued therapy (11.9% vs 5.7%, p<0.01). Data from the Treating New Targets (TNT) study, however, suggested that short-term discontinuation of statin therapy in patients with stable cardiac conditions may not substantially increase the risk of acute coronary syndromes. In patients with acute coronary syndromes who discontinue statins, the rapid increase in risk of an event may result not only from the lost benefits from the therapy, but also from rebound inhibition of vascular protective substances and activation of vascular deleterious substances. Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis in vascular cells. By reducing levels of isoprenoid intermediates, statins increase the production of nitric oxide and downregulate angiotensin II AT(1) receptors, endothelin-1, vascular inflammatory adhesion molecules, and inflammatory cytokines. These benefits are rapidly lost and often transiently reversed when statins are acutely discontinued. Acute removal of pleiotropic effects and rebound vascular dysfunction may be more important in an acute coronary event, where inflammation promotes rupture of atherosclerotic plaques and inflammatory and prothrombosis markers are present in high concentration, than in stable chronic vascular disease. In the absence of data from randomized controlled trials, current information suggests that statin therapy should be continued, and possibly boosted, during hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome. Because statins are discontinued during the early hospitalization of many patients, practitioners must ensure that statins are not omitted, unless contraindicated, from the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "133": "Proteomics is a technology to detect and identify several proteins and their isoforms in a single sample. We used proteomics to analyze modifications in the protein map of plasma after simvastatin treatment of moderate hypercholesterolemic patients. Plasma from hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 9) was compared before and after 12 weeks of simvastatin treatment (40 mg/day). Patients with similar cardiovascular risk factors were used as controls (CR group). By using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we identified the different protein isoforms. The plasma expression of three fibrinogen gamma chain isoforms (FGG) was enhanced, whereas the expression of two isoforms of the fibrinogen beta chain (FGB) was reduced in the hypercholesterolemic patients compared with the CR group. The expression of apolipoprotein A-IV and three haptoglobin isoforms was higher in hypercholesterolemic patients. Simvastatin treatment modified the plasma expression of FGG chain isoform 1, FGB chain isoforms 1 and 2, vitamin D binding protein isoform 3, apo A-IV, and haptoglobin isoform 2. The modification of FGG chain isoform 1 and FGB chain isoforms 1 and 2 was positively correlated with total plasma cholesterol level. Proteomic analysis of plasma may help to know more in depth the molecular mechanism modified by simvastatin treatment.", 
    "134": "Statins are utilised in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, due to their efficacy at lowering lipid levels. However, statins may also prevent atherosclerosis disease by non-lipid or pleiotropic effects, for example, improving endothelial function by promoting the production of NO. By increasing NO production, statins may interfere with atherosclerosis lesion developement, stabilise plaque, inhibit platlet aggregation, improve blood flow and protect against ischaemia. Therofore, the ability of statins to improve endothelial function through the release of NO may partialy account for their beneficial effects at reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events. Other pleiotropic effects of statins, i.e. immunomedulatory, antiinflammatory, antioxidant and antiendothelin effects, also contribute to the reduction of the incidence of major cardiovascular events. Statins have become the basic drugs in high risk cardiovascular patients with hypercholesterolemia. The ATP III update recommends an optional therapeutic target of LDL-C < 1,8 mmol/L in very high risk patients: those with acute coronary syndrome or those with CHD plus diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, multiple-risk factors, or a poorly controlled risk factor. Studies have demonstrated benefit from lipid lowering irrispective of initial LDL-C levels, including those with average levels at baseline.", 
    "135": "Statin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was shown to increase BMP-2 gene expression for bone formation, by blocking the mevalonate pathway in cholesterol production. We investigated the effect of naringin, a flavonoid available commonly in citrus fruits, which was also a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in UMR 106 osteoblastic cell line in vitro. The control group consisted of cells cultured without any intervention for different time intervals (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h), whereas the experimental (naringin) group consisted of cells cultured with naringin of different concentrations (0.001 micromol/L, 0.01 micromol/L, and 0.1 micromol/L) for the same time intervals of the control. Colorimetric Tetrazolium (MTT) assay, total protein content assay, and alkaline phosphatase activity were used to measure the cellular activities. Results for the naringin group showed an increase in MTT assay compared with the control and the effect was dose dependent. At high concentration (0.1 micromol), the increases ranged from 60% to 80%. In the total protein content assay, naringin also showed an increase compared with control and the effect was also dose dependent. At high concentration (0.1 micromol), the increases ranged from 9% to 20%. In the alkaline phosphatase activity assay, naringin at high concentration (0.1 micromol) significantly increased the activity up to 20%. In conclusion, naringin significantly increased bone cell activities in vitro. This is the first study specifically attempted to investigate the effect of naringin on bone cell activities. Besides statin, this provided another example of mevalonate pathway blockage in the cholesterol production pathway by HMG-CoA reductase inhibition will increase the bone cell activities.",

Human accidental infection may result in abdominal lesions. The presence of the eggs in the tissues plays an essential role in morbidity of abdominal angiostrongyliasis. The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the effects of lovastatin, phenanthrolin, and mebendazole on oviposition of A. costaricensis in a murine experimental model. Each group of 12 male Swiss mice (Mus musculus) was orally infected with 10 L3 of the \"Santa Rosa\" strain of A. costaricensis. Two control groups were established: (1) mice were infected and not treated; (2) noninfected and nontreated animals. The experimental groups received (1) lovastatin TL), at a daily dose of 250 mg/kg for 10 consecutive days 16 days after infection; (2) phenanthroline at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days 21 days after infection; and (3) mebendazole at a daily dose of 5 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days 21 days after infection. There was no significant inhibition of oviposition for lovastatin- and mebendazole-treated animals, whereas phenanthroline was associated with the lowest averages of larviposition per postinfection day and significant reduction of mortality.", 
    "137": "Statin treatment inhibits oxidized lipoprotein-induced intracellular lipid accumulation (foam cell formation) and reduces plasma levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). The aim of the present study was to determine if simvastatin affected lipid accumulation in macrophages incubated with aggregated low density lipoproteins (AgLDL) and whether simvastatin had a direct effect on cytokine secretion from macrophages. Simvastatin treatment did not inhibit AgLDL-induced macrophage lipid accumulation, but significantly increased the secretion of IL-1beta and IL-8 from macrophages, whilst inhibiting the secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and having no significant effect on IL-6 secretion. Increased macrophage lipid content did not block statin-induced IL-1beta and IL-8 secretion. Simvastatin-stimulated IL-1beta secretion from macrophages was inhibited by isoprenoids. We therefore hypothesized that simvastatin stimulated IL-1beta secretion by affecting isoprenylation-dependent signaling pathways. Another possible mechanism for affecting such signaling is to impair isoprenoid transfer protein activity with specific inhibitors such as GGTI-297 and FTInhI. This treatment resulted in strong stimulation of IL-1beta secretion that was further enhanced when exogenous IL-1beta was present at the beginning of treatment. These data suggest an isoprenylation-dependent negative-feedback loop for macrophage IL-1beta secretion that is inhibited by statin treatment.",

    "142": "The mean cholesterol level of the civilized modern humans is above the one considered \"physiological\", and a biological gradient exists between serum cholesterol level and cardiovascular events. Clinical studies on cholesterol lowering revealed that cardiovascular risk can be lowered in parallel along this gradient, and the \"lower is better\" rule appears to be supported by the current evidence. LDL cholesterol level should minimally be reduced on average by 50% to approach the \"physiological\" cholesterol concentration in order to halt the progression of atherosclerosis. Using the initial doses of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), the first-line lipid lowering drugs, this goal cannot be reached. On the other hand, high doses of statins increase the frequency of adverse events, which should contribute to the common failure of putting patients to their lipid targets in a real-world setting. Consequently, the combination of low dose statins and another cholesterol lowering agent with a mechanism of action different than synthesis inhibition (such as ezetimibe) may be the optimal clinical approach to avoid the dose-dependent adverse events. The ongoing large head-to-head clinical trials will clarify the efficacy and safety of cholesterol lowering combination therapy relative to statins in the reduction of cardiovascular risk.",

Significant reductions in plasma levels of VLDL+IDL-C (-35.7%; P = 0.001), VLDL+IDL-apolipoprotein B (-30%; P = 0.005), non-HDL-C (-12.9%; P = 0.001), and total-apolipoprotein B (-17.9%; P < 0.001) were seen with the 3-drug treatment compared with simvastatin alone. Compared with simvastatin monotherapy, simvastatin + fenofibrate-treated (2-drug treatment) patients had significantly lower plasma levels of triglycerides (-24.9%; P = 0.014) and significantly higher levels of HDL-C (+5.4%; P = 0.008). Significant reductions were also seen in levels of VLDL+IDL-C (-28.6%; P = 0.004), VLDL+IDL-apolipoprotein B (-26.7%; P < 0.001), non-HDL-C (-9.1 %; P= 0.004), and total-apolipoprotein B (-12.3%; P < 0.001) in the 2-drug treatment group compared with the simvastatin monotherapy group. The administration of 3-drug treatment was associated with improved responses in all lipoprotein fractions, although only the increase in HDL-C level was statistically significant (+7.7%; P = 0.008) compared with 2-drug treatment.", 
    "147": "Treatment with the 3-drug regimen was associated with a significant reduction in triglyceride levels compared with simvastatin monotherapy. However, there was not a significant incremental reduction in triglyceride levels when nicotinic acid was added to the 2-drug treatment, suggesting that the triglyceride-lowering effect of fenofibrate + nicotinic acid is not cumulative. To obtain clinically meaningful responses, particularly for the treatment of elevated HDL-C, higher doses of nicotinic acid might be required.", 
    "148": "This study evaluated novel structural motifs known as \"plum pudding\" gels as potential drug-eluting stent coatings. Controlled delivery of a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) from the intravascular stent surface represents a potential therapeutic modality for prevention of in-stent restenosis (ISR). In this study, gels were comprised of fluvastatin-loaded thermoresponsive microgel particles containing the relatively hydrophilic N-isopropylacrylamide (NiPAAm), mixed with the more hydrophobic N-tert-butylacrylamide (NtBAAm) in different wt/wt ratios: 85/15, 65/35, and 50/50, randomly dispersed in a 65/35 or 85/15 NiPAAm/NtBAAm copolymer matrix. Fluvastatin release from 5 microm copolymer films was greatest from the most hydrophilic systems and least from the more hydrophobic systems. Release from hydrophobic matrices appeared to be via Fickian diffusion, enabling use of the Stokes-Einstein equation to determine diffusion coefficients. Release from hydrophilic matrices was non-Fickian. Eluted drug retained its bioactivity, assessed as selective inhibition of human coronary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation. When stainless steel stent wires were coated (25 microm thickness) with fluvastatin-loaded 65/35 microgels in an 85/15 copolymer matrix, drug elution into static and perfused flow environments followed similar elution profiles. In contrast to elution from copolymer films cast on flat surfaces, diffusion from stent wires coated with hydrophilic and hydrophobic systems both followed Fickian patterns, with slightly larger diffusion coefficients for elution from the flow system. We conclude that manipulation of the relative hydrophobicities of both microgel and matrix components of \"plum pudding\" gels results in tightly regulated release of fluvastatin over an extended time period relevant to initiation and propagation of ISR.", 
    "149": "Although the cause of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is unknown, drugs are believed to be potential triggers in some patients. In isolated case reports, statins have been considered such triggers. Here we describe 3 patients in whom it is probable that statins initiated the development of AIH. Two men (aged 47 and 51) and one woman (aged 57) developed AIH after the initiation of statin therapy. They developed positive titers of antinuclear antibodies, antismooth muscle antibodies (1/40 to 1/160), and hypergammaglobulinemia. Features of all 3 patients met the criteria for AIH according to the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Panel. Liver biopsies in all 3 showed varying stages of fibrosis and plasma cell infiltration, compatible with AIH. The woman developed hepatitis due to statins on 2 separate occasions: the first in 1999, due to simvastatin, and the second in 2001 to 2002, due to atorvastatin, which was severe and persisted even after discontinuing medication. Similarly, in the 2 other cases, exposure to statins preceded development of AIH, which persisted despite discontinuing medications. All 3 patients responded well to prednisone and azathioprine or mycophenolate therapy. 3 similar previously reported cases are reviewed. We conclude that the 3 cases reported here and 3 similar previously reported cases, indicate that severe, ongoing AIH on rare occasions can be triggered by statins.",

    "151": "A 64-year-old man developed cognitive difficulties within one week after starting simvastatin 40 mg/day. There was a 3 point decline from baseline in the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score 2 weeks after simvastatin was initiated, as well as declines in the Activities of Daily Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scales. Simvastatin was discontinued, and the patient's cognition improved to baseline within 6 weeks. Rechallenge with simvastatin at half the original dose was attempted. His cognition deteriorated over a 2 week period. Simvastatin was stopped, and the patient's MMSE scores returned to baseline within 4 weeks.", 
    "152": "This patient developed new-onset problems with short-term memory, long-term memory, and item misplacement in addition to the baseline problems with names and word-finding that had been present prior to beginning statin therapy. Decreased cognition identified with neuropsychological tests has been shown in clinical trials with simvastatin; however, as of August 23, 2006, this is the first report of cognitive and functional problems that have been documented using standardized instruments. The Naranjo probability scale revealed a highly probable adverse reaction of cognitive decline associated with simvastatin therapy.", 
    "153": "Statins are commonly used in the older population. Simvastatin appeared to be associated with worsened cognition in our patient, an older person with preexisting memory problems. Statins should be used with caution in this vulnerable population.", 
    "154": "C-reactive protein (CRP) plays a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. It is a marker and predictor of cardiovascular disease. CRP possesses numerous cardiovascular effects (clotting, generation of oxygen radicals, increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, plaque destabilization) that could result in cardiovascular disease. This review describes the effects of various cardiovascular drugs on the levels of CRP in health and disease. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin, rofecoxib, celecoxib), platelet aggregation inhibitors (clopidogrel, abciximab), lipid lowering agents (statins, ezetimibe, fenofibrate, niacin, diets), beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists and antioxidants (vitamin E), as well as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ramipril, captopril, fosinopril), reduce serum levels of CRP; while enalapril and trandolapril have not been shown to have the same effect. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (valsartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, telmisartan) markedly reduce serum levels of CRP. The findings with other ARBs (losartan and candesartan) were inconsistent. Antidiabetic agents (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) reduce CRP levels, while insulin is ineffective. Calcium channel antagonists have variable effects on CRP levels. Hydrochlorothiazide and oral estrogen do not affect CRP. The CRP-lowering effect of statins is more pronounced than their lipid lowering effect and is not dependent on their hypolipemic activity. The effect of atorvastatin on CRP seems to be dose-dependent. CRP-lowering effect of statins is likely to contribute to the favorable outcome of statin therapy. The data suggest that lipid lowering agents, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, antidiabetic agents, antiinflammatory and antiplatelet agents, vitamin E, and beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists lower serum or plasma levels of CRP, while vitamin C, oral estrogen and hydrochlorothiazide do not affect CRP levels.", 
    "155": "Concerns regarding a potential link between statin treatment and increased risk of cancer were raised following the increased cancer incidence observed in patients treated with pravastatin in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events and Pravastatin in Elderly Individuals at Risk of Vascular Disease studies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the risk of cancer associated with fluvastatin treatment in clinical trials. A pooled analysis of all available, randomised, placebo-controlled trials with fluvastatin with a minimum treatment period of 24 weeks was performed. The cancer incidences were compared in 3512 patients receiving fluvastatin, 20-80 mg/day, and 3289 patients receiving placebo. Overall, fewer patients were diagnosed with cancer in the fluvastatin group compared with the placebo group [220/3512 (6.3%) vs. 263/3289 (8.0%) respectively; p = 0.0309]. Cox regression analysis, adjusted for baseline covariates and stratified by study, revealed a hazard ratio for first cancer diagnosis of 0.812 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.667-0.989; p = 0.037] for fluvastatin compared with placebo. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of cancers by site, with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer (103 vs. 125 cases in the fluvastatin and placebo groups respectively; p = 0.047). Cox regression analysis showed that there was no association between baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the risk of developing cancer (hazard ratio 0.998, 95% CI 0.995-1.000; p = 0.107). In conclusion, fluvastatin treatment is not associated with an increased risk of cancer compared with placebo in clinical trials, independent of patient age, treatment duration and baseline cholesterol levels.", 
    "156": "Previous experimental studies have demonstrated that MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) contribute to LV (left ventricular) remodelling. We hypothesized that cardiac MMPs are activated in patients with AMI (acute myocardial infarction) and, if so, MMP production may be attenuated by statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) through their cardiovascular protective actions. We studied 30 patients, ten control patients with stable angina pectoris and 20 patients with AMI, in whom LV catheterization at the chronic stage was performed 22+/-12 days (value is mean+/-S.D.) after the onset of AMI. Blood samples were collected from the CS (coronary sinus) and a peripheral artery. In patients with AMI, the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly (P<0.05) higher in the CS than the peripheral artery (MMP-2, 853+/-199 compared with 716+/-127 ng/ml; MMP-9, 165+/-129 compared with 98+/-82 ng/ml), whereas no significant differences were observed in the patients with angina pectoris. The CS-arterial concentration gradients of MMP-2 and MMP-9 correlated positively with BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) levels (MMP-2, R=0.68, P<0.01; MMP-9, R=0.59, P<0.05) and LV end-diastolic volume index (MMP-2, R=0.70, P<0.01; MMP-9, R=0.70, P<0.01). When patients with AMI treated with 10 mg of pravastatin or without (n=10 in each group) were compared, this statin therapy significantly (P<0.05) decreased the CS-arterial concentration gradients of MMP-2 (69+/-43 compared with 213+/-185 ng/ml) and MMP-9 (14+/-27 compared with 119+/-84 ng/ml). In conclusion, the enhanced production of cardiac MMP-2 and MMP-9 is associated with LV enlargement and elevated BNP levels in patients with AMI. A pleiotropic effect of statins appears to be associated with the modulation of cardiac MMP activation, which may be potentially beneficial in the attenuation of post-infarction LV remodelling.", 
    "157": "There are a variety of agents, dosages, and mechanisms involved in reducing cholesterol. Statins are the most well-known class and three of the six currently available agents have now lost patent protection. Thus, large reductions in price are expected in 2006-2007 across the entire class. The other classes of cholesterol-lowering agents include targeted triglyceride reducers and high-density lipoprotein boosters; two other classes include primarily cholesterol absorption inhibitors. A recent addition to the cholesterol-lowering prescriptions include prescription omega-3 products, which are highly concentrated, have excellent quality control, and are used to reduce abnormally high levels of triglycerides. All of these agents can be used in some restricted combination, or individually to significantly impact the various forms of lipids in the bloodstream. The bottom line is that practitioners have a large diversity of medications available for cholesterol lowering, and this is enormously exciting at a time when these agents have such profound effects in a variety of disciplines.", 
    "158": "This is the largest and longest clinical study to date to examine statin usage and overall patient survival following clinically localized prostate cancer. In a retrospective examination of 938 consecutive patients with early-stage prostate cancer treated with brachytherapy, 191 patients were documented to be taking statin medications. The patients taking statin medications had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen values, percent positive biopsies, and prostate volume than those patients not taking statin medications. Statin usage resulted in a nonstatistical improvement in all survival parameters with the results most pronounced for atorvastatin. Improving prostate cancer survival with statins could have important treatment implications and could potentially limit or even improve the role of supplemental therapies. A prospective trial of statin medications in conjunction with definitive local treatment for prostate cancer is recommended.", 
    "159": "Human bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are responsible the remodeling of human tissue. However, damaged aortic valves are lack the ability to regenerate which is an active cell-mediated process. Diseased aortic valve remodeling has similarities even to bone formation. In this study, the prerequisites for cultured MSCs to undergo osteoblastic differentiation on aortic valves were explored. An ex vivo model using a human aortic valve microenvironment was developed. The expression of type I procollagen, alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin secretion and osteocalcin immunostaining were studied to evaluate the induction of osteogenesis of the MSCs on noncalcified and calcified human aortic valves. Aortic valves were exposed to freeze-thaw injury to devitalize valves in order to separately study the role of valve matrix vs. endothelial cells in the explants. Thus, valves were assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: noncalcified uninjured valves, calcified uninjured valves, noncalcified injured and calcified injured. Finally, valves were decalcified to separately explore the effect of a calcified matrix on the osteogenesis. In this co-culture system, the noncalcified uninjured valves inhibited osteogenesis of MSCs, whereas the calcified valves promoted differentiation towards osteoblastic lineage. Devitalization of the valve matrix inflicted a significant increase in the osteogenesis of co-cultured MSCs. Calcified matrix in the valves seemed to have a role in the spontaneous osteogenesis of the MSCs. This spontaneous matrix induced differentiation of MSCs into osteoblast lineage could not be inhibited by pravastatin, indomethacin or tetracycline. In conclusion, these results suggest that interactions between MSCs and aortic valve matrix components and cells modulate MSC phenotype in this environment. Further studies are required to characterize this interesting phenomenon in greater detail.", 
    "160": "Statins produce cholesterol-independent, anti-inflammatory effects, which result at least in part from increased endothelial nitric oxide production. These effects may be modulated by polymorphisms in the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene. Here, we examined whether the T-786C polymorphism of eNOS gene affects the concentrations of markers of atherosclerosis and inflammation (sCD40L, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, sP-selectin, MCP-1, high sensitivity (hs)-CRP, MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-1). We also studied whether atorvastatin-induced anti-inflammatory effects are modulated by this polymorphism. Healthy male volunteers (N=200), Caucasians, non-smokers, were genotyped for the T-786C polymorphism by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Subjects with TT or CC genotype received placebo for 14 days followed by 14 days of treatment with atorvastatin, 10mg/day p.o. The concentrations of inflammatory markers were measured with ELISA kits or by gelatin zymography. Serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly reduced after atorvastatin treatment in both genotype groups (P<0.05). No significant differences between genotype groups were found in the concentrations of the inflammatory markers after placebo. However, atorvastatin significantly reduced the concentrations of sCD40L, sVCAM-1, sP-selectin and MMP-9 in subjects with CC (but not TT) genotype (P<0.05). While atorvastatin decreased hs-CRP levels in both genotype groups (P<0.05), no significant effects were found on the concentrations of sICAM-1, MCP-1, pro-MMP-9, pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-1. These results suggest no effects for the T-786C polymorphism on the concentrations of inflammatory markers. However, this polymorphism modulates the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin. These findings may be relevant for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in subjects with CC genotype, who may be at increased cardiovascular risk and could benefit from treatment with statins.", 
    "161": "Although there are specific guidelines regarding the treatment of dyslipidemia in highly risk patients, these recommendations are usually inadequately followed. The aim of this study is to investigate risk factors in patients with increased cardiovascular risk currently treated in Brazil and Venezuela. Medical charts of 412 patients were selected in 4 institutions. Patients were divided into groups according to the use of lipid-lowering drugs (LLD), particularly statins. Patients who did not use LLD showed higher levels of total cholesterol (p< 0.001), LDL cholesterol (p< 0,001) and HDL cholesterol (p< 0.001), besides lower levels of triglycerides (p< 0.001). The use of statins was associated with a decrease in levels of total cholesterol (from 251.0 +/- 40.0 to 196.0 +/- 46.0), LDL cholesterol (from 168.0 +/- 36.0 to 116.0 +/- 39.0), HDL cholesterol (from 51.0 +/- 46.0 to 46.0 +/- 12.0) and triglycerides (from 181.0 +/- 120.0 to 160.0 +/-79.0). Finally, only a small percentage of patients, even those under treatment with LLD, showed cholesterol levels according to currently available guidelines. Therefore, although the guidelines for the treatment of dyslipidemia are widely known, only a small percentage of patients achieve adequate levels of cholesterol. It is necessary to decrease lipid levels of these patients by increasing the dose of the statins or using a second drug."
