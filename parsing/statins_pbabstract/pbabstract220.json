This study simulated the effects of directed versus global approaches for intervention on coronary heart disease (CHD) event rates.", 
    "1": "A primary prevention population was generated by computer simulation derived from data from the National Health Survey for England. The efficacy of reductions in cholesterol, treatment to cardiovascular risk targets and effects of phytosterols or statins were assessed.", 
    "2": "A 0.5 mmol/L reduction in population total cholesterol would result in a 10.4% reduction in CHD events, while 1.0 mmol/L, 1.5 mmol/L and 2.0 mmol/L reductions would achieve 21.0%, 30.6% and 41.9% reductions respectively. In statin-based cardiovascular risk targeted strategies, use of simvastatin 40 mg would result in 1.8% reduction by UK National Service Framework targets of 30%/decade CHD risk and 7.2% reduction in events for a 20%/decade target assuming perfect adherence. Similarly, aggressive primary prevention with 40 mg atorvastatin would result in a 2.5% or 10% reduction in events. Universal use of 10 mg simvastatin following an over-the-counter approach would result in a 25% reduction in CHD events. In contrast, whole population consumption of sitostanol/sitosterol products would result in 11.8% reduction.", 
    "3": "Targeting and treating high-risk individuals may be beneficial for them and rewarding for medical practitioners. However, this approach has minimal effects on the population burden of atherosclerotic disease. This study suggests that universal therapy with phytosterols and/or wider availability of statins has the potential to dramatically decrease rates of CHD.", 
    "4": "Statins, well-known inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis and protein isoprenylation, have been proposed as therapeutic drugs for multiple sclerosis (MS). As lovastatin and simvastatin, which are currently tested for their use in MS, can cross the blood-brain barrier, they may affect cellular processes in the central nervous system. This is especially relevant with respect to remyelination as a proposed additional treatment for MS, because cholesterol is a major component of myelin. Here, we show that primary oligodendrocytes, treated with lovastatin, form extensive membrane sheets, which contain galactosphingolipids. However, these membrane sheets are devoid of the major myelin proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP). Reduced MBP protein expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and in situ hybridization experiments revealed that lovastatin blocks MBP mRNA transport into oligodendrocyte processes. In contrast, PLP expression was only mildly affected by lovastatin. However, lovastatin treatment resulted in intracellular accumulation of PLP and prevented its translocation to the cell surface. Interestingly, another inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis (ro48-8071), which does not interfere with isoprenylation, had a similar effect on the localization of PLP, but it did not affect MBP expression and localization. These results suggest that lovastatin affects PLP transport predominantly by the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, whereas reduced MBP expression is caused by impaired isoprenylation. Based on these results we recommend to carefully monitor the effect of statins on myelination prior to their use in demyelinating diseases.", 
    "5": "Although the prescription of statin medication has increased worldwide and especially in Europe, its musculoskeletal side effects and their management strategy has not been highlighted in orthopaedic literature. We present three cases of statin-induced musculoskeletal symptoms which presented to an orthopaedic department. There were two patients with statin induced muscle pain (one in the thigh and one around the hip), and one with both myositis (with raised creatine kinase) and lupus-like symptoms. All of the symptoms resolved with stopping the statin. Muscle pain (often with normal creatine kinase) is the commonest side effect of statins. It is usually bilateral, but two of our cases presented with unilateral symptoms which made it more difficult to exclude a primary orthopaedic pathology. The widespread use of statins is likely to lead to an increase in the number of patients presenting to orthopaedic surgeons with muscle pain. It is important to consider muscle pain induced by statins in the differential diagnosis of acute or chronic pain in the limbs.",

    "7": "We identified 807 NSTE ACS patients treated conservatively in the 29 hospitals participating in the Krakow Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes from February to March 2005 and from December 2005 to January 2006. Out of 807 patients' 32.1% were less than 65 years of age, 33% from 65 to 74, 30.5% from 75 to 84, and 5.3% >or= 85. For all patients, pharmacotherapy index based on the use of pharmacological treatment regimen during hospital stay was assessed. Each patient received 1 point for each of the following guideline-recommended drugs used: aspirin, clopidogrel, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, LMWH, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker and statin - the range of points being from 0 to 7.", 
    "8": "Significant age-related differences in baseline characteristics and pharmacotherapy index values were found. In-hospital mortality was higher in elderly patients (2.4% vs. 3.4% vs. 8.9% vs. 14.0%, respectively for age groups, p < 0.0001). Similarly, in non-shock patients and in patients with elevated cardiac markers, age-dependent differences in mortality were observed. Independent predictors of in-hospital death were: age, cardiogenic shock, elevated cardiac markers and pharmacotherapy index.", 
    "9": "Advanced age is associated with less aggressive pharmacological treatment and higher in-hospital mortality in NSTE ACS patients remaining in community hospitals for conservative treatment. Broader implementation of current guidelines and more frequent invasive treatment might improve the outcomes of NSTE ACS patients regardless of age.",

    "11": "We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 284 158 consecutive patients in Ontario aged 65 years and older who were admitted for elective surgery. We identified exposure to statins from outpatient pharmacy records before admission. We identified delirium by examining hospital records after surgery.", 
    "12": "About 7% (n = 19 501) of the patients were taking statins. Overall, 3195 patients experienced postoperative delirium; the rate was significantly higher among patients taking statins (14 per 1000) than among those not taking statins (11 per 1000) (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-1.47, p < 0.001). The increased risk of postoperative delirium persisted after we adjusted for multiple demographic, medical and surgical factors (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12-1.46) and exceeded the increased risk of delirium associated with prolonging surgery by 30 minutes (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.19-1.21). The relative risk associated with statin use was somewhat higher among patients who had noncardiac surgery than among those who had cardiac surgery (adjusted OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.16-1.53), and extended to more complicated cases of delirium. We did not observe an increased risk of delirium with 20 other cardiac or noncardiac medications.",

    "14": "The use of in vitro data for quantitative predictions of transporter-mediated elimination in vivo requires an accurate estimation of the transporter Michaelis-Menten parameters, V(max) and K(m), as a first step. Therefore, the experimental conditions of in vitro studies used to assess hepatic uptake transport were optimized regarding active transport processes, nonspecific binding, and passive diffusion (P(dif)). A mechanistic model was developed to analyze and accurately describe these active and passive processes. This two-compartmental model was parameterized to account for nonspecific binding, bidirectional passive diffusion, and active uptake processes based on the physiology of the cells. The model was used to estimate kinetic parameters of in vitro transport data from organic anion-transporting peptide model substrates (e.g., cholecystokinin octapeptide deltorphin II, fexofenadine, and pitavastatin). Data analysis by this mechanistic model significantly improved the accuracy and precision in all derived parameters [mean coefficient of variations (CVs) for V(max) and K(m) were 19 and 23%, respectively] compared with the conventional kinetic method of transport data analysis (mean CVs were 58 and 115%, respectively, using this method). Furthermore, permeability was found to be highly temperature-dependent in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) control cells and artificial membranes (parallel artificial membrane permeability assay). Whereas for some compounds (taurocholate, estrone-3-sulfate, and propranolol) the effect was moderate (1.5-6-fold higher permeability at 37 degrees C compared with that at 4 degrees C), for fexofenadine a 16-fold higher passive permeability was seen at 37 degrees C. Therefore, P(dif) was better predicted if it was evaluated under the same experimental conditions as V(max) and K(m), i.e., in a single incubation of CHO overexpressed cells or rat hepatocytes at 37 degrees C, instead of a parallel control evaluation at 4 degrees C.", 
    "15": "Our recent studies with lactacystin, a prototype proteasome inhibitor, have suggested that the proteasome is a key regulator of LPS-induced signaling pathways contributing to the inflammatory process. Moreover, lactacystin protects animals from LPS-induced shock. Therefore, we sought to identify other less toxic compounds that would block the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome or LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO). After screening over 100 natural compounds (based on chemistry and inhibition of LPS-induced biological activities), we now report for the first time that quercetin, like lactacystin (the prototype proteasome inhibitor), and mevinolin are also inhibitors of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the cellular proteasome within living cells. In addition, this study also suggests that mevinolin and quercetin both have relatively potent anti-inflammatory effects on LPS-treated macrophages in vitro. Interestingly, both of these compounds behave like lactacystin in that they block LPS-induced NO to a greater extent than TNF-alpha. The results of our experiments clearly suggest that mevinolin, in combination with the antibiotic imipenem, can provide protection against polymicrobial septic lethality induced by cecal-ligation and puncture in mice. Collectively, these studies strongly support the conclusion that therapeutic targeting of cellular proteasomes, in conjunction with standard antimicrobial therapy, may be of considerable survival benefit in the treatment of septic shock.", 
    "16": "The coconut water presents a series of nutritional and therapeutic properties, being a natural, acid and sterile solution, which contains several biologically active components, l-arginine, ascorbic acid, minerals such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, which have beneficial effects on lipid levels. Recent studies in our laboratory showed that both tender and mature coconut water feeding significantly (P<0.05) reduced hyperlipidemia in cholesterol fed rats [Sandhya, V.G., Rajamohan, T., 2006. Beneficial effects of coconut water feeding on lipid metabolism in cholesterol fed rats. J. Med. Food 9, 400-407]. The current study evaluated the hypolipidemic effect of coconut water (4ml/100g body weight) with a lipid lowering drug, lovastatin (0.1/100g diet) in rats fed fat-cholesterol enriched diet ad libitum for 45 days. Coconut water or lovastatin supplementation lowered the levels of serum total cholesterol, VLDL+LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and increased HDL cholesterol in experimental rats (P<0.05). Coconut water feeding decreased activities of hepatic lipogenic enzymes and increased HMG CoA reductase and lipoprotein lipase activity (P<0.05). Incorporation of radioactive acetate into free and ester cholesterol in the liver were higher in coconut water treated rats. Coconut water supplementation increased hepatic bile acid and fecal bile acids and neutral sterols (P<0.05). Coconut water has lipid lowering effect similar to the drug lovastatin in rats fed fat-cholesterol enriched diet.",

    "40": "Cyclodextrins are well-known biocompatible oligosaccharides capable of forming inclusion complexes with suitable guest molecules. They can be expediently used as solubilizers for hydrophobic pharmacon molecules in aqueous solutions. In this study, the effect of colloidal and non-colloidal additives on the solubility of statins is described. Two statin-derivatives (lovastatin and simvastatin), beta-cyclodextrin (-CD) and randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin (RAMEB) were used as complexing agents. Those pharmacons are widely used in the management of cardiovascular diseases involving high or elevated blood cholesterol levels. Complexation of the highly lipophilic statin molecules with beta-CD and RAMEB was studied in the presence and the absence of dissolved polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP). For the characterization of the stability of statin-CD complexes, association constant of binary associates have been calculated. It was found that inclusion complexation can beneficially enhance the solubility of both statin-derivatives. In binary statin-CD solutions predominantly associates of 1:1 molar ratio form, which show significant surface activity. In polymer-containing ternary systems, the solubility of the pharmacons can further be increased. This phenomenon can presumably be explained with the formation of statin-CD-polymer ternary associates of supramolecular structure. In such supramolecular assemblies the amphiphilic statin-CD complexes are likely bound to the macromolecules' chains. The wetting properties of solid, dried and powdered complexes were studied by immersion enthalpy measurements. Both in binary and ternary systems a significant increase in the immersion enthalpy values could be detected, which indicates that the complexes exhibit fairly hydrophilic character.", 
    "41": "Simvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering agent whose functional significance and neuroprotective mechanism in ischemic brain injury is not yet solved. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of simvastatin on ischemic brain injury. We examined the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (UPR/unfolded protein response), by measuring the mRNA and protein levels of specific genes such as ATF6, GRP78, and XBP1 after 15 min 4-VO ischemia and different times of reperfusion (1, 3, and 24 h). The results from the group of na\u00efve ischemic rats were compared with results from the group of pre-treated animals with simvastatin. The results of the experiments showed significant increase in all genes at the mRNA level in ischemic phase (about 43% for XBP1, 58% for GRP78, and 39% for ATF6 more than control). The protein level of XBP1 was decreased in pre-treated animals at ischemic phase and first hour of reperfusion (about 15% less), and did not reach control levels. The protein levels of GRP78 were maximal at third hour of reperfusion in statin group with a small decrease at 24 h of reperfusion in both groups. The levels of ATF6 mRNA in statin-treated animals was higher in comparison to non-statin animals at the ischemic phase and the third hour of reperfusion (about 35% higher), which was also translated into the higher protein level. This could indicate that one of the main proteins targeted to enhance neuroprotective effect to ER during the first two hours of reperfusion was ATF6 protein, the levels of which were 60% higher than in non-treated animals. These data suggest that simvastatin, in addition to the proposed neuroprotective effect, exerts a neuroprotective role in the attenuation of ER stress response after acute ischemic/reperfusion insult.",

A slight decrease in plasma levels of sCD14, TNF-alpha and sTNFRI was observed in 7/10 patients and faecal calprotectin was reduced in 8/10 patients. We also observed that the treatment diminished expression of CCR2 and CX(3)CR1 on monocyte populations (P=0.014). At the follow-up visit, 8 weeks after the atorvastatin treatment was terminated, CRP levels had returned to those seen before the treatment.",

As a frequent cause of death, sepsis now rivals acute myocardial infarction. The longstanding therapeutic principles of early antibiotics use and supportive care have been difficult to improve upon. The authors conducted a concise review of pertinent literature on the pathophysiologic mechanisms of sepsis and the pharmacologic effects of statins. They conclude that, though statins possess anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties, these effects may not be advantageous throughout the changing immunoresponse that can occur in sepsis syndrome. Based on the available information, statin therapy seems advantageous before the onset of sepsis and during sepsis resolution--but not during the compensatory anti-inflammatory response that may occur. Thus, the authors recommend that, until the status of a patient's changing immune response can be clearly determined, the uninterrupted use of statin therapy throughout the full spectrum of sepsis should be avoided.", 
    "47": "Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease and a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease in industrialized countries in Europe and North America. About 40-50% of hypertensive patients have some other cardiovascular risk factors as smoking, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. The realization of optimal therapy of these patients is a difficult task, and reaching target blood pressure values is almost impossible by monotherapy. It was realized that the simultaneous normalization of blood pressure and that of abnormal lipid profile with 2-3 or more drugs have great importance for preventing atherosclerotic complications.We started an open-formed study with about 1000 hypertensive patients complicated with dyslipidemia, visceral obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes type 2. The base of our therapeutic strategy was a typical poly-pharmacologic treatment with ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), calcium antagonist (amlodipine), statin (atorvastatin) and antiplatelet therapy (if it was necessary).", 
    "48": "One of the greatest challenges of cardiovascular prevention is to minimize the risk of cardiovascular events through the achievement of target lipid levels. Its importance is suggested by the comprehensive meta-analyses of large scale clinical trials and the therapeutic guidelines determining everyday clinical practice. The attainment of target levels is often emphasized, nevertheless, there is a gap between theory and practice. The authors compare the goal attainment rate based on Hungarian medical literature and their own data, and analyze the possibilities of further improvement. The CEL Program evaluated the achievement rate of target total cholesterol levels in more than 10 000 patients of general practitioners in 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the ratio increased from 12% to 30% within 3 years. According to the results of the Hungarian REALITY study the rate of patients achieving the target total cholesterol levels was 21% in 2004, and it increased to 27% during a 3-year period. To this very low improving rate also belongs the fact that in 2007, when only one fourth of patients were on target levels, 87% of general practitioners and 56% of specialists reconciled themselves to it and did not propose any modification in the therapy of patients not achieving the target levels. The surveys conducted at the department of internal medicine with cardiological profile of the county hospital in Gyula proved a considerable increase in the last 7 years in the administration of drugs improving the life expectancy of cardiovascular patients (aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and statins) due to the widespread application of clinical guidelines and the special attention; nowadays the administration rate is above 90% in all four groups. Nevertheless, the rate of patients achieving the LDL-cholesterol goals was 37% in the high risk and 18% in the very high risk groups in December 2007 and January 2008. The fact that in the latter group only 21% of patients received combination therapy indicates that improving this ratio may be the next step. A greater emphasis should be placed on the achievement of target levels and regular revision of applied medical therapy, particularly in the high and very high risk patients as these groups can benefit the most from it.", 
    "49": "Autopsy studies have shown the near universal presence of fatty streaks and fibroatheromas in the general population from which chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients arise. The vast majority of CKD patients have multiple conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Atherosclerosis, once present, can predominantly manifest as medial calcification, which has been previously termed M\u00f6nckeberg's sclerosis. This term has also been used in rare cases to describe vascular calcinosis not related to CKD. This clarification is critical to advance the field in terms of pathological diagnosis and treatment of CKD bone and mineral disorder. Factors that appear to promote the osteoblastic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells and enhance deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals include phosphorus activation of the Pit-1 receptor, bone morphogenic proteins 2 and 4, leptin, endogenous 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D, vascular calcification activating factor, and measures of oxidative stress. These entities work to accelerate the atherosclerotic process in CKD patients and may be future targets for diagnosis and treatment. Although conventional atherosclerotic risk factors should be optimally managed, it should be noted that trials of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors have failed to attenuate the rate of progressive vascular calcification as measured by computed tomography scans.", 
    "50": "The prognostic value of a hypertensive blood pressure (BP) response is still unclear. Therefore, the prognostic value of a hypertensive BP response in patients during single-stage exercise testing for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) on long-term mortality and major adverse cerebrovascular and cardiac events (MACCEs) was investigated. In addition, effects of statin, beta-blocker, and aspirin use in patients with known or suspected PAD were studied. A total of 2,109 patients were enrolled in an observational prospective study from 1993 to 2005. Hypertensive BP response was defined as an increase in systolic BP > or = 55 mm Hg (95(th) percentile within our population) after a single-stage treadmill exercise test. The outcome was obtained by using the civil registries, and a questionnaire about cardiac events was sent to all survivals. Hypertensive BP response was associated with increased risk of long-term mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 1.80) and MACCEs (HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.97). After adjustments for clinical risk factors and propensity score, baseline statin use was associated with reduced risk of long-term mortality (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.79), and statin, beta-blocker, and aspirin use were associated with reduced risk of MACCEs (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.81; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95; HR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.92, respectively). In conclusion, hypertensive BP response at exercise in patients with known or suspected PAD is an important independent risk factor for all-cause long-term mortality and MACCEs, whereas statin, beta-blocker, and aspirin use were associated with an improved outcome.",

We investigated whether atorvastatin can prevent renal tubular cell injury by oxalate and inhibit renal crystal retention.", 
    "53": "Ten-week-old specific pathogen-free male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Atorvastatin (2 mg/kg) in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose was administered orally daily for 2 weeks. The rats were separated into 4 experimental groups, including group 1--water and 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose daily, group 2--water and atorvastatin in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose daily, group 3--1% ethylene glycol dissolved in water, 0.5 mug vitamin D3 dissolved in 1 ml salad oil and 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose daily, and group 4--1% ethylene glycol dissolved in water, 0.5 microg vitamin D3 dissolved in 1 ml salad oil and atorvastatin in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose daily. The ethylene glycol model of hyperoxaluria and the effect of atorvastatin treatment were analyzed in groups 1 to 4. Urine samples were collected every 24 hours in metabolic cages and analyzed immediately or stored at -70C until analysis. The rats were sacrificed after 2 weeks and the kidneys were removed for further examination. We measured urinary N-acetyl glucosaminidase levels as a biomarker of renal tubular cell injury and urinary 8-OHdG as a biomarker of oxidative stress in 24-hour urine samples. Removed kidneys were used for quantitative analysis of the superoxide dismutase level and the detection of apoptosis. Finally, we measured the amount of crystal deposits in renal tubular cells.", 
    "54": "Urinary N-acetyl glucosaminidase and 8-OHdG levels were decreased significantly by atorvastatin treatment in this stone forming rat model. Atorvastatin treatment increased the superoxide dismutase level and inhibited the degree of renal tubular cell N-acetyl glucosaminidase compared with stone forming control group 3. A decrease in renal crystal retention was noted when excised kidneys were evaluated following atorvastatin treatment.", 
    "55": "Atorvastatin was found to have inhibitory effects on the renal tubular cell injury and oxidative stress caused by oxalate and crystals. Atorvastatin inhibited renal crystal retention. We believe that atorvastatin could help prevent and treat renal crystal formation.", 
    "56": "We sought to assess whether statin-mediated reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with an increased risk of cancer.", 
    "57": "We recently reported an inverse association between on-treatment LDL-C levels and incident cancer in statin-treated patients enrolled in large randomized controlled trials, raising concern that LDL-C lowering by statins may increase cancer risk. However, meta-analyses suggest a neutral overall effect of statins on incident cancer.", 
    "58": "A systematic literature search identified 15 eligible randomized controlled trials of statins with >or=1,000 person-years of follow-up that provided on-treatment LDL-C levels and rates of incident cancers (19 statin and 14 control arms, 437,017 person-years cumulative follow-up, and 5,752 incident cancers).", 
    "59": "In the statin arms, meta-regression analysis demonstrated an inverse association between on-treatment LDL-C and incident cancer, with an excess of 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 0.7 to 3.6) cancers per 1,000 person-years for every 10 mg/dl decrement in on-treatment LDL-C (p=0.006). The corresponding difference among control arms was 1.2 (95% confidence interval: -0.2 to 2.7, p=0.09). Compared with the control arms, the statin regression line was significantly shifted leftward, such that similar rates of incident cancer were associated with lower on-treatment LDL-C (p<0.05). Meta-regression demonstrated that statins lack an effect on cancer risk across all levels of on-treatment LDL-C.", 
    "60": "There is an inverse association between on-treatment LDL-C and incident cancer. However, statins, despite producing marked reductions in LDL-C, are not associated with an increased risk of cancer.", 
    "61": "Simvastatin was reported to attenuate platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced vascular smooth muscle proliferation by up-regulation of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27, but had no effect on p16, p21, p53 expression. We investigate the mechanisms by which simvastatin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth in high glucose conditions to mimic diabetes. Simvastatin was added to A7r5 cells cultured in high glucose (25 mM) medium, mimicking diabetes. We used an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to evaluate cell viability; flow cytometric analysis for cell counts distribution in the cell cycle; and Western blot, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation analyses to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on CDK activity and cell cycle regulatory proteins. Cell counts were significantly increased in G0/G1 phase and significantly decreased in S and G2/M phases. In our study, low dose of simvastatin had no significant inhibitory effect on VSMC growth in normal glucose condition. However, both low and high doses of simvastatin inhibited VSMC growth significantly in a dose-dependent manner in high glucose status. We also found that simvastatin inhibited phosphorylation of Rb, promoted expression of p53, p16, p21, p27 and decreased CDK2/4 activity. In conclusion, simvastatin inhibits VSMC proliferation in high glucose status, mimicking diabetes, inducing a G0/G1 phase cell cycle growth arrest by acting on multiple steps upstream of pRb, including inhibition of CDK2/4 expression and up-regulation of p53, p21, p16, and p27. We propose that statins may be used more extensively in diabetic patients regardless of lipid status for preventing atherosclerosis and restenosis after PCI.", 
    "62": "Ezetimibe has been reported to improve lipid control in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD).", 
    "63": "The aim of this study was to estimate the potential long-term impact on health status of prescribing ezetimibe in combination with statin therapy in patients with established CVD and evaluate its cost-effectiveness in a health economic model.", 
    "64": "A Markov model was used to compare ezetimibe and statin combination therapy with statin monotherapy. A published relationship linking changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events was used to estimate the cardiovascular events avoided through lipid-lowering therapies. The model was populated using results of extensive literature searches and a meta-analysis of clinical evidence. An adjustment was applied to model second-line lipid-lowering benefits. Conservative assumptions were used to extend the patient pathway beyond the clinical evidence. The analysis took the perspective of the UK Department of Health; therefore, only direct costs were included. Costs were calculated as year-2006 British pounds.", 
    "65": "For a cohort of 1,000 hypothetical male patients aged 55 years, ezetimibe coadministered with current statin therapy was estimated to prevent a mean of 43 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 7 nonfatal strokes, and 26 cardiovascular deaths over a lifetime, compared with doubling the current statin dose. The events avoided would provide a mean of 134 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). With a mean incremental cost of pound 3,693,000, the lifetime discounted cost per QALY gained would be pound 27,475 (95% CI, pound 27,331- pound 27,620) and would rise to pound 32,000 for men aged 75 years.", 
    "66": "The results suggest that, in some instances, ezetimibe coadministration may be cost-effective compared with statin monotherapy, but there are several limitations with this model. The economic effects of ezetimibe must be revisited when long-term effectiveness and safety data become available.", 
    "67": "Pharmacokinetic studies in mice traditionally require one animal per time point, resulting in dosing and euthanizing a large number of animals and producing suboptimal quality of pharmacokinetic data due to inter-animal variability and dosing error. These studies are time-consuming and labor-intensive. To improve the throughput and quality of pharmacokinetic evaluation in mice, we have developed a serial blood sampling methodology using the lateral saphenous vein puncture technique. Two marketed drugs, indinavir and rosuvastatin, were selected for this validation study because of their distinctly different physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. Each compound was dosed orally and intravenously in mice using both discrete and serial blood sampling methods. The pharmacokinetic results from serial bleeding are in excellent agreement with those from discrete sampling for both compounds. Compared to the discrete sampling, the serial sampling procedure is a more humane method, allowing for rapid and repeated sampling from the same site without the need for anesthesia. The application of this new method has led to a remarkable reduction in animal and compound usage, a significant increase in throughput and speed, and a drastic improvement in pharmacokinetic data quality. This approach is especially useful for the first-tier in vivo pharmacokinetic screening of discovery compounds.", 
    "68": "Women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a condition characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), often suffer pregnancy-related complications, including miscarriage. We have previously shown that C5a induction of tissue factor (TF) expression in neutrophils contributes to respiratory burst, trophoblast injury, and pregnancy loss in mice treated with aPL. Here we analyzed how TF contributes to neutrophil activation and trophoblast injury in this model. Neutrophils from aPL-treated mice expressed protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2), and stimulation of this receptor led to neutrophil activation, trophoblast injury, and fetal death. An antibody specific for human TF that has little impact on coagulation, but potently inhibits TF/Factor VIIa (FVIIa) signaling through PAR2, inhibited aPL-induced neutrophil activation in mice that expressed human TF. Genetic deletion of the TF cytoplasmic domain, which allows interaction between TF and PAR2, reduced aPL-induced neutrophil activation in aPL-treated mice. Par2-/- mice treated with aPL exhibited reduced neutrophil activation and normal pregnancies, which indicates that PAR2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of aPL-induced fetal injury. We also demonstrated that simvastatin and pravastatin decreased TF and PAR2 expression on neutrophils and prevented pregnancy loss. Our results suggest that TF/FVIIa/PAR2 signaling mediates neutrophil activation and fetal death in APS and that statins may be a good treatment for women with aPL-induced pregnancy complications.", 
    "69": "We investigated whether the local administration of simvastatin affected both the cellular events and the bone formation at surgically created bone defects in rat.", 
    "70": "Simvastatin (or a vehicle) was injected into a rat bony defect for 3 consecutive days from the day of surgery. Five or ten days after the injection, new bone tissue was collected, and the gene expressions of bone-related proteins were examined. For the histomorphometry, new bone area was measured.", 
    "71": "At day 5, the statin group demonstrated significantly larger new bone area. The number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleated cells in the statin group was less than in the control group. In the statin group, the expressions of both alkaline phosphatase and bone morphogenetic protein 2 mRNA significantly increased. In contrast, the expression of cathepsin K was significantly suppressed in the statin group. Although the levels of both RANK and osteoprotegerin were not affected by statin, the expression of RANKL was depressed. At day 10, there were no significant differences among the groups in either histomorphometric or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses.", 
    "72": "New bone area increased under the influence of simvastatin; however, the effect did not continue when the administration was terminated. Osteoclast suppression may be the consequence of RANKL depression.", 
    "73": "A low serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration is an excellent predictor of hyperthyroidism, either overt or subclinical. Whether statin use influences the ability of a low serum TSH measurement to detect hyperthyroidism has not been evaluated.", 
    "74": "In a cohort of 307 patients with low or undetectable serum TSH concentrations suggestive of hyperthyroidism, we determined whether concurrent statin use influenced the results of radioiodine uptakes and scans. Participants included 29 patients taking a statin medication and 278 who were not taking a statin. Radioiodine uptakes and scans were interpreted by board-certified nuclear medicine physicians.", 
    "75": "Sixteen of the 29 patients who were taking a statin (55%) had normal radioiodine uptakes and scans despite their low serum TSH. The remaining 13 low-TSH patients who were taking a statin (45%) had abnormal uptakes and scans, most commonly showing diffuse thyroid hyperplasia with increased radioiodine uptake. In contrast, the vast majority of the 278 patients not taking a statin had abnormal uptakes and scans (84%), while only 16% of them had normal uptakes and scans (p < 0.001 vs. those on statins). The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio of a statin user with a low serum TSH having normal radioiodine studies (as opposed to abnormal studies) was 3.6 (95% CI, 1.6-8.4).", 
    "76": "In patients with a low serum TSH concentration, normal thyroid function and morphology, as assessed by radioiodine studies, were much more common if the patient was taking a statin. Statins may falsely lower the serum TSH without altering thyroid function (\"pseudohyperthyroidism\") or, alternatively, statins may improve thyroid function in patients with hyperthyroidism.", 
    "77": "The Treating to New Targets (TNT) clinical trial found that intensive 80 mg atorvastatin (A80) treatment reduced cardiovascular events by 22% when compared to 10 mg atorvastatin (A10) treatment. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of intensive A80 vs A10 treatment in the United Kingdom (UK), Spain, and Germany. A lifetime Markov model was developed to predict cardiovascular disease-related events, costs, survival, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Treatment-specific event probabilities were estimated from the TNT clinical trial. Post-event survival, health-related quality of life, and country-specific medical-care costs were estimated using published sources. Intensive treatment with A80 increased both the per-patient QALYs and corresponding costs of care, when compared to the A10 treatment, in all three countries. The incremental cost per QALY gained was <euro> 9,500, <euro> 21,000, and <euro> 15,000 in the UK, Spain, and Germany, respectively. Intensive A80 treatment is estimated to be cost-effective when compared to A10 treatment in secondary cardiovascular prevention.",

This was a 14-week, open-label study including patients from 27 countries across the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, Africa and Latin America. Eight dosage strengths of single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin (5/10, 10/10, 5/20, 10/20, 5/40, 10/40, 5/80 and 10/80 mg) were titrated to improve blood pressure and lipid control. Blood pressure and lipid goals were determined according to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) and National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (NCEP ATP III) guidelines, respectively (blood pressure, <140/90 or <130/80 mm Hg; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), <4.1 to <2.6 mmol l(-1) (<160 to <100 mgdl(-1))). Overall, 1649 patients received study medication. Most patients (91.4%) had >or=1 cardiovascular risk factor (as defined by NCEP ATP III guidelines) in addition to hypertension/dyslipidaemia, and 61.7% had coronary heart disease/risk equivalent. At baseline, mean blood pressure was 146.6/88.3 mm Hg and LDL-C was 3.4 mmol l(-1) (130.2 mgdl(-1)). At week 14, 55.2% of patients reached both blood pressure and lipid goals, 61.3% reached blood pressure goal and 87.1% reached lipid goal (34.0% were at lipid goal at baseline). Mean blood pressure reduction was 20.2/11.4 mm Hg. For patients who were lipid-lowering drug naive at baseline, mean reduction in LDL-C was 41.0%. Treatment-related adverse events led to the discontinuation of 3.6% of patients. Single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin therapy was well tolerated and effective for the reduction of blood pressure and lipids to recommended goals in patients from diverse ethnic backgrounds.",

    "84": "The activity of lovastatin associated with oxamniquine or praziquantel against schistosomiasis mansoni was evaluated in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Forty days after infection, mice were treated with lovastatin, 400 mg/kg for five consecutive days by oral route, and on the last day of this sequence with 50 mg/kg oxamniquine or with 200 mg/kg praziquantel, both by oral route, single dose. Fifteen days later, the animals were perfused in parallel with an untreated control group. Studies were carried out in vitro, using lovastatin in culture medium containing S. mansoni worms proceeding from experimentally infected mice. In the in vivo trials, the association of lovastatin with oxamniquine or praziquantel did not show any additive action, but there were oogram changes when lovastatin was associated with oxamniquine. In vitro lovastatin was able to interrupt the maturation of S. mansoni eggs, which remained at the 1st or 2nd stages, depending on the dose used. The total number of morphologically dead eggs found in culture of worms exposed to 2 microg/ml or 4 microg/ml concentrations of lovastatin was significantly higher than the number of viable eggs. Using the probe Hoescht 33258 it was observed that 70% of the eggs considered morphologically viable in the treated groups (against 16% in the control group) were labeled, indicating that the majority of the viable eggs had membrane permeability increased due to lovastatin action.",

Sixty patients, aged 13 to 60 years, with idiopathic (N = 14) or congenital heart disease-associated PAH (N = 46) were equally but randomly assigned to rosuvastatin treatment (10 mg a day, orally) or placebo for 6 months in a blind fashion. Plasma levels of P-selectin, tissue-plasminogen activator and its inhibitor as well as von Willebrand factor antigen were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay before and after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. Baseline levels of biomarkers were elevated (68, 16, 45 and 46% increase relative to controls, for P-selectin, von Willebrand factor antigen, tissue-plasminogen activator and its inhibitor, respectively; P < 0.001). P-selectin values at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months were 39.9 +/- 18.5, 37.6 +/- 14.6, 34.8 +/- 14.6, and 35.4 +/- 13.9 ng/mL, respectively, for the rosuvastatin group and 45.7 +/- 26.8, 48.0 +/- 26.9, 48.1 +/- 25.7, and 45.7 +/- 25.6 ng/mL for the placebo group. The P-selectin level was lower in the rosuvastatin group compared with placebo throughout treatment (P = 0.037, general linear model). A trend was observed towards a decrease in tissue-plasminogen activator in the statin group (16% reduction, P = 0.094), with no significant changes in the other markers. Since P-selectin is crucial in inflammation and thrombosis, its reduction by rosuvastatin is potentially relevant in the pathophysiological scenario of PAH.",

In a crossover study, 32 healthy volunteers with different SLCO1B1 genotypes ingested a single dose of fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin. Plasma total cholesterol, and cholesterol synthesis and absorption markers were measured before statin administration and up to 12 h thereafter. The mean fasting baseline plasma desmosterol to cholesterol ratio was 40% higher in participants with the SLCO1B1 c.521CC variant genotype than in those with the c.521TT genotype (P=0.043). The genotype had no significant effect on cholesterol absorption markers. All statins decreased lathosterol and avenasterol to cholesterol ratios, but no significant differences in the response existed between SLCO1B1 genotypes. In conclusion, the low activity SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype is associated with an increased cholesterol synthesis rate. The short-term effects of statins on cholesterol homeostasis were not associated with the SLCO1B1 polymorphism.",

    "106": "Endothelial injury is thought to play a pivotal role in the development and progression of vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension or restenosis, as well as their complications, including myocardial infarction or stroke. Accumulating evidence suggests that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) promote endothelial repair and contribute to ischemia-induced neovascularization. Coronary artery disease and its risk factors, such as diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and smoking, are associated with a reduced number and impaired functional activity of circulating EPCs. Moreover, initial data suggest that reduced EPC levels are associated with endothelial dysfunction and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, compatible with the concept that impaired EPC-mediated vascular repair promotes progression of vascular disease. In this review we summarize recent data on the effects of pharmacological agents on mobilization and functional activity of EPCs. In particular, several experimental and clinical studies have suggested that statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, PPAR-gamma agonists and erythropoietin increase the number and functional activity of EPCs. The underlying mechanisms remain largely to be defined; however, they likely include activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, as well as inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase activity of progenitor cells.", 
    "107": "Statins, which are known as cholesterol-lowering drugs, have several additional effects including the enhancement of bone formation and the stimulation of smooth muscle cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the signal pathway of simvastatin operating in C2C12 myoblast cells. Myotube formation of C2C12 cells was efficiently blocked by 1 muM simvastatin, and mevalonic acid was able to cancel this effect. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate restored the myotube formation, whereas farnesyl pyrophosphate did not. These findings demonstrate that the Rho family, such as Rho, Rac and Cdc42, occurring downstream of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate in the mevalonic acid pathway, was involved in the simvastatin-mediated blockage of myotube formation. An inhibitor of Rho kinase did not influence the myotube formation; whereas an inhibitor of Rac blocked this process. Taken together, we conclude that the differentiation of C2C12 cells into myotubes was blocked by simvastatin through the pathway mediated by Rac, not by Rho.",

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control, ADR nephrosis, and simvastatin-treated ADR nephrosis groups. ADR nephropathy was induced by a single-tail intravenous injection of ADR (6.5 mg/kg). Anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin were studied by evaluating the expression of the inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). In addition, renal function, serum lipid levels, and histopathology were compared between groups. Simvastatin significantly decreases IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 expression and NF-kappaB activation, accompanied by significant attenuation of glomerulosclerosis and renal function at 12 weeks after ADR injection, and these changes occurred in the absence of lowering of serum lipids. These results suggest that overexpression of inflammation in the renal region may contribute to development of glomerulosclerosis in ADR-induced-nephropathy rats, and simvastatin treatment prevented glomerulosclerosis independent of the lipid-lowering effects. The beneficial effect of simvastatin might be mediated by the effect of anti-inflammatory action through a reduction of NF-kappaB activation, and IL-1beta and TGF-beta expression.",

Added to the MLR, atorvastatin reduced (i) the human PBMC response to unstimulated (P<0.05) and (ii) the human and baboon PBMC responses to stimulated (P<0.05) WT and GTKO pAEC. Atorvastatin treatment of human PBMC before MLR reduced their response to stimulated WT (P<0.05) and GTKO (P<0.05) pAEC. Stimulation of pAEC with pIFN-gamma increased SLA II expression 20- to 60-fold, which was down-regulated by atorvastatin. Atorvastatin treatment of stimulated pAEC before MLR reduced proliferation of human PBMC (P<0.05) and CD4+ T cells (P<0.05). Atorvastatin down-regulates the primate cellular xenoresponse, possibly through its antiproliferative effect on PBMCs and the reduction of SLA II on pAECs.",

Circulating IFN-gamma was also reduced, as were graft IFN-gamma and IFN-gamma-inducible chemokine transcripts and graft human leukocyte antigen-DR expression. Graft arteriosclerosis directly induced by human IFN-gamma in the absence of human PBMCs was also reduced by atorvastatin, but only at the highest dose of 100 mg/kg/day.

Eight-week-old male ApoE-KO mice (n = 20) were fed a high-fat diet with or without rosuvastatin (10 micromol.kg(-1).day(-1)) for 16 wk. When compared with control, rosuvastatin reduced total cholesterol levels (P < 0.05) and caused significant retardation of lesion progression in the brachiocephalic artery, as visualized in vivo using an ultrasound biomicroscope (P < 0.05). Histological analysis confirmed the reduction of brachiocephalic atherosclerosis and also revealed an increase in collagen content in the statin-treated group (P < 0.05). Coronary volumetric flow was measured by simultaneous recording of Doppler velocity signals and left coronary artery morphology before and during adenosine infusion. The hyperemic flow in response to adenosine was significantly greater in left coronary artery following 16 wk of rosuvastatin treatment (P < 0.001), whereas the baseline flow was similar in both groups. In conclusion, rosuvastatin reduced brachiocephalic artery atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE-KO mice. Coronary artery function assessed using recently developed in vivo ultrasound-based protocols, also improved.",

Recent studies suggest that this conversion occurs via a cholesterol-sensitive process, as cholesterol synthesis inhibitors reduced the formation of PrPSc and delayed the clinical phase of scrapie infection. Since polyunsaturated fatty acids also reduced cellular cholesterol levels we tested their effects on PrPSc formation in three prion-infected neuronal cell lines (ScGT1, ScN2a and SMB cells).",

Simvastatin reduced cholesterol production while DHA and EPA promoted the conversion of free cholesterol to cholesterol esters. Crucially, while simvastatin reduced PrPSc formation, both DHA and EPA significantly increased the amounts of PrPSc in these cells. Unlike simvastatin, the effects of DHA and EPA on PrPSc content were not reversed by stimulation of cholesterol synthesis with mevalonate. Treatment of ScGT1 cells with DHA and EPA also increased activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 and prostaglandin E2 production. Finally, treatment of neuronal cells with DHA and EPA increased the amounts of PrPC expressed at the cell surface and significantly increased the half-life of biotinylated PrPC.", 
    "126": "We report that although treatment with DHA or EPA significantly reduced the free cholesterol content of prion-infected cells they significantly increased PrPSc formation in three neuronal cell lines. DHA or EPA treatment of infected cells increased activation of phospholipase A2, a key enzyme in PrPSc formation, and altered the trafficking of PrPC. PrPC expression at the cell surface, a putative site for the PrPSc formation, was significantly increased, and the rate at which PrPC was degraded was reduced. Cholesterol depletion is seen as a potential therapeutic strategy for prion diseases. However, these results indicate that a greater understanding of the precise relationship between membrane cholesterol distribution, PrPC trafficking, cell activation and PrPSc formation is required before cholesterol manipulation can be considered as a prion therapeutic.",

Patients with extensive atherosclerosis included into the study (n=46, mean age 56.5 +/- 2.2 years) were distributed to 2 equivalent according to clinico-instrumental data groups. To patients of group 1 (n=24) standard therapy was prescribed (antiaggregants, ACE inhibitors, b-adrenoblockers, and nitrates when indicated), patients of group 2 (n=22) in addition to standard therapy took rosuvastatin (10 mg/day).

It was found that level of 3-nitrotirosine and activity of secretory phospholipase A2 together with high sensitivity C-reactive protein appear to be effective markers of systemic oxidative stress and endogenous inflammation in patients with extensive atherosclerosis. Treatment with rosuvastatin in moderate doses significantly suppressed activity of endogenous inflammation and oxidative stress by way of activation of antioxidant system of plasma, decrease of oxidation of fractions of lipoproteins, suppression of \" nitrotirosine \" stress, as well as partial inhibition of efficacy of action of secretory phospholipase A2, lowering of content of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6.",

CKD-related dyslipidemia such as increased triglyceride-rich atherogenic lipoproteins such IDL, small dense LDL and low HDL associated with insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, and malnutrition co-existing dyslipidemia such as high LDL are both causetive for early-onset atherogenesis and, possibly progression of CKD, thus are the therapeutic targets in early intervention of CKD. Life-style modification aimed for both renoprotection and anti-dyslipidemia as well as medications for metabolic disorders in CKD patients such as Ca/P imbalance is crucial for correction of dyslipidemia, and also prevention of cardiovasclular events and ESRD in CKD patients.

    "136": "Some of the statins' pleiotropic actions have been attributed to their antioxidant activity. The Nrf2 transcription factor controls the expression of a number of protective genes in response to oxidative stress. In the present study, wistar rats, primary hepatocytes as well as ST2 cells, were employed to explore the potential role of Nrf2 in mediating the reported antioxidant effects of statins. Simvastatin triggered nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in rat liver and in primary rat hepatocytes in a mevalonate-dependent and cholesterol-independent way. In liver, nuclear extracts from simvastatin-treated rats, the DNA-binding activity of Nrf2, was significantly increased and the mRNA of two known targets of Nrf2 (HO-1 and GPX2) was induced. In ST2 cells stably transfected with constructs bearing Nrf2-binding site (antioxidant responsive element), simvastatin enhanced Nrf2-mediated transcriptional activity in a mevalonate-dependent and cholesterol-independent fashion. In conclusion, activation of Keap1/Nrf2 signaling pathway by simvastatin might provide effective protection of the cell from the deleterious effects of oxidative stress.",

    "138": "Statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease or in those at risk for cardiovascular disease is associated with a reduced incidence of ischemic stroke. The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial showed treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg daily in patients with a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) reduces the incidence of fatal and nonfatal stroke by 16%. In this population with a recent stroke or TIA, coronary artery disease events and the need for revascularization were a frequent occurrence. Furthermore, the relative reduction of noncerebrovascular events and the need for revascularization was greater with atorvastatin than the reduction of stroke. A patient with a recent ischemic stroke or TIA is at high risk for fatal and nonfatal coronary events (approximately 4% per year), and according to most guidelines for the management of coronary artery disease, such patients should be in the high risk category. Consequently, ischemic stroke should be considered to be a coronary risk equivalent with a prognosis similar to that of a patient with coronary artery disease. Furthermore, both the stroke and coronary artery disease prognoses are improved by treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg daily.",

It is endogenously synthesised via the mevalonate pathway, and some is obtained from the diet. CoQ(10) supplements are available over the counter from health food shops and pharmacies. CoQ(10) deficiency has been implicated in several clinical disorders, including but not confined to heart failure, hypertension, Parkinson's disease and malignancy. Statin, 3-hydroxy-3- methyl-glutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy inhibits conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate and lowers plasma CoQ(10) concentrations. The case for measurement of plasma CoQ(10) is based on the relationship between levels and outcomes, as in chronic heart failure, where it may identify individuals most likely to benefit from supplementation therapy. During CoQ(10) supplementation plasma CoQ(10) levels should be monitored to ensure efficacy, given that there is variable bioavailability between commercial formulations, and known inter-individual variation in CoQ(10) absorption. Knowledge of biological variation and reference change values is important to determine whether a significant change in plasma CoQ(10) has occurred, whether a reduction for example following statin therapy or an increase following supplementation. Emerging evidence will determine whether CoQ(10) does indeed have an important clinical role and in particular, whether there is a case for measurement.",

Soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), a marker of vascular inflammation, seems to predict vascular damage in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Beside the lipid-lowering effect, statins seem to slow the progression of atherosclerosis through a series of anti-inflammatory effects, including a reduction of sCD40L levels. This study compared the effect of a short-term (12 weeks) treatment with rosuvastatin or simvastatin on some markers of inflammation in 36 patients with Type 2 diabetes and moderate hypercholesterolemia. As expected, both drugs significantly modified lipid profile; moreover, rosuvastatin and simvastatin were both able to significantly reduce albumin excretion rate in these patients, without affecting urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase. Serum homocysteine was not influenced by the treatment, as interleukin-6 levels, while C reactive protein diminished; moreover, rosuvastatin, but not simvastatin, was able to significantly reduce sCD40L. The only clinical parameter related with the variations in sCD40L was systolic blood pressure.

Coronary arteries of this group were harvested at week 30, and the subsegments of interest were identified, and analyzed histopathologically.",

The size and size distribution of the aggregates were investigated by dynamic and static light scattering, and the morphology was probed by transmission electron microscopy. The abilities of the different derivatives to solubilize the drug simvastatin were also evaluated. Poloxamines with both higher PO/EO ratio and molecular weight (T1301 and T150R1) led to micelles with larger and more hydrophobic cores, particularly adequate for hosting hydrophobic molecules and protecting the labile lactone form of simvastatin from hydrolysis. On the other hand, the hydroxy acid form of simvastatin interacted with the central ethylenediamine group under alkaline pH (T304) or when a permanent positive charge due to methylation was present. Micelles of long poloxamine molecules containing large PPO blocks (with 23-29 units, namely, T1301, T1307, and T150R1), particularly the one that also has long PEO blocks, were the most physically stable toward dilution.",

    "168": "There was a high correlation between the total number of cardiovascular risk factors and the number of FDG-accumulating active plaques as well as the number of calcified inactive plaques. There was a significant difference in the number of plaques between all age-groups except for active plaques in age groups 60-70 and 80-90 years.",

The proportion of women, initially 25%, did not change. Weight increased from 84.7 to 88.5 kg, whereas the proportion of patients with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension increased by 35%, 52%, and 48%, respectively. However, the proportion of patients with elevated blood pressure level did not change significantly. Peak relative aerobic capacity decreased by 10%. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 20%, 35%, and 27%, respectively, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 12%. Use of all evidence-based cardiovascular drugs increased significantly, particularly statins (from 25% to 77%).",

    "174": "This study investigated the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren and modulators of P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Aliskiren stimulated in vitro P-glycoprotein ATPase activity in recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells with high affinity (K(m) 2.1 micromol/L) and was transported by organic anion-transporting peptide OATP2B1-expressing HEK293 cells with moderate affinity (K(m) 72 micromol/L). Three open-label, multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects investigated the pharmacokinetic interactions between aliskiren 300 mg and digoxin 0.25 mg (n = 22), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 21), or ketoconazole 200 mg bid (n = 21). Coadministration with aliskiren resulted in changes of <30% in AUC(tau) and C(max,ss) of digoxin, atorvastatin, o-hydroxy-atorvastatin, and rho-hydroxy-atorvastatin, indicating no clinically significant interaction with P-glycoprotein or CYP3A4 substrates. Aliskiren AUC(tau) was significantly increased by coadministration with atorvastatin (by 47%, P < .001) or ketoconazole (by 76%, P < .001) through mechanisms most likely involving transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic anion-transporting peptide and possibly through metabolic pathways such as CYP3A4 in the gut wall. These results indicate that aliskiren is a substrate for but not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. On the basis of the small changes in exposure to digoxin and atorvastatin and the <2-fold increase in exposure to aliskiren during coadministration with atorvastatin and ketoconazole, the authors conclude that the potential for clinically relevant drug interactions between aliskiren and these substrates and/or inhibitors of P-glycoprotein/CPY3A4/OATP is low.",

Simulated patients' characteristics matched those of participants in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid-Lowering Arm and event probabilities were calculated with Framingham Heart Study risk equations. The real-world adherence scenario employed adherence data from an observational study of a US population; risk reductions at each level of adherence were based on linear extrapolations from clinical trials. Outputs included life expectancy, frequencies of primary and secondary coronary heart disease and stroke, and direct medical costs in 2006 US$. The incremental cost per life-year gained and incremental cost per event avoided were calculated comparing the three adherence scenarios.",

The average number of cardiovascular events per patients was 0.738 (no treatment), 0.610 (real-world adherence), and 0.441 (ideal adherence). The incremental cost of real-world adherence versus no treatment is $30,585 per life-year gained, and ideal adherence versus real-world adherence is $22,121 per life-year gained.",

Clinical studies have shown that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) and fibric acid derivative (fibrate) combination therapy is effective at improving multiple lipid abnormalities in different patient populations at increased risk of CHD. However, inconsistencies with respect to trial designs and safety issues have limited the clinical use of this combination therapy.

An approximate total of 2400 patients with elevated triglycerides (TG) [> or =150 mg/dL], reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [<40 mg/dL for men and <50 mg/dL for women], and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [> or =130 mg/dL] will be randomized to one of six intervention arms per trial (two combination therapy and four monotherapy groups). The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint is a composite of the mean percent changes in HDL-C and TG (comparing each combination therapy with the corresponding statin monotherapy dose) and LDL-C (comparing each combination therapy with ABT-335 monotherapy). Secondary endpoints include mean percent changes in non-HDL-C, very LDL-C, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.

Patients previously receiving ezetimibe/simvastatin combination therapy, or simvastatin 20, 40, and 80 mg monotherapy continued the same therapies in this 7-arm extension study.

The incidence increased five-fold (95% CI 4.9, 5.1) from 355 per 100 000 inhabitants to 1772 during the respective years. The prevalence and incidence were the highest among persons aged 65-74 years. The largest relative increase in incidence was found among those aged >/= 75 years, in both females (RR 14.1, 95% CI 13.0, 15.3) and males (RR 14.0, 95% CI 12.5, 15.7).

Statins are the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of dyslipidaemias and their use for the prevention of vascular events is evidence based. Statins raise HDL-C but this effect seems to vary considerably between studies. We searched the literature to assess the relationship between statin-induced increases in HDL-C levels and surrogate and/or clinical endpoints. Based on the existing evidence, it is difficult to determine how much reduction, if any, in vascular risk is attributable to a statin-induced increment in HDL-C levels. Whether a statin that beyond its LDL-C lowering effect also raises HDL-C has additional benefits in the prevention of vascular events remains to be established.", 
    "191": "In this crossover study of ezetimibe monotherapy in 48 antiretroviral-treated patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, the mean changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were -5.3% (-11 mg/dL) and +5.5% (+4 mg/dL) with ezetimibe treatment and placebo, respectively (P = .04). Ezetimibe was safe and effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and is an option for patients who cannot tolerate treatment with a statin.", 
    "192": "Marked lowering of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (< or =50%) with intensive statin therapy is associated with major reduction in cardiovascular risk, but is limited by a potential increase in adverse effects, thereby justifying optimization of LDL-C reduction with minimal risk. The organic anion transporting polypeptide-1B1 encoded by the SLCO1B1 gene is implicated as a major transporter in cellular uptake of statins, and notably fluvastatin. We postulated that genetic variation in SLCO1B1 might affect statin bioavailability, and might therefore influence drug response and potential adverse effects.",

    "194": "Due to linkage disequilibrium, only four alleles (*1b, *5, *14 and *15) of SLCO1B1 were detected in addition to the wild-type allele (*1a). The c.463A genotype, which was systematically associated with the c.388G SNP corresponding to the *14 allele was significantly associated with percentage LDL-C reduction from baseline (p = 0.005) and with mean post-treatment LDL-C values (p = 0.0005). Subjects homozygous for the c.463C genotype (n = 294) exhibited significantly less LDL-C reduction and higher post-treatment LDL-C levels (-31.5%, 138 mg/dl) relative to heterozygous C/A patients (-36.2%, 126 mg/dl; n = 111), and to homozygous A/A subjects (-41%, 115 mg/dl; n = 15).", 
    "195": "These results reveal that OATP1B1 is implicated in the pharmacological action and efficacy of fluvastatin. Indeed, the common *14 allele, which is distinguished by the presence of the c.463C>A polymorphism, was associated with enhanced lipid-lowering efficacy in this study.",

Among other statins, pravastatin is abundantly prescribed to reduce risk of coronary artery disease by lowering cholesterol. Genetic factors are thought to be partly responsible for the interindividual variation in the response to pravastatin. This article reviews the most important studies conducted on the pharmacogenetics of pravastatin. Currently there is no evidence to advocate pharmacogenetic testing before initiating therapy.",

    "200": "Traditional cardiac risk factors were common: hypertension 59%, diabetes 13%, and smoking 22%. On the basis of the FRS, 11% (n=12/114) of the patients met high-risk criteria requiring aggressive cholesterol reduction. Of those in the low- and intermediate-risk groups, MSCT found coronary plaque in 76% (n=77/102), with moderate or severe plaque in 38% (n=39/102), thus reclassifying them in the high-risk category. Use of statin drugs increased from 32% at baseline to 53% (p=0.002) based on MSCT results; statin dose was increased in 31% of the patients who were already on a statin. The mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) decreased from 114 mg/dL to 91 mg/dL after MSCT (p<0.001).", 
    "201": "Multislice computed tomography reclassifies a high percentage of patients considered to be low- to intermediate-risk into the high-risk category based on their coronary artery lesions. Thus, the rise in MSCT use at present may have a large impact on clinician practice patterns in lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "202": "Older sibutramine studies showed beneficial effects on lipid profile compared to placebo. However, nowadays many obese patients are treated with lipid lowering drugs before the start of sibutramine therapy and their effects in these patients have not been investigated. Therefore we started a long-term follow up of patients on sibutramine with or without previous and continuing statins. Here we present results of the first 3 months follow up of 11 patients on sibutramine 10 mg +statin group, and that of 13 patients on sibutramine 10 mg alone. Sibutramine led to the weight loss from 101.6 to 96.9 kg and in BMI from 36.35 to 34.66 kg/m2. Lipid profile changed thus: total cholesterol 4.97...5.01mmol/l (p = 0.7), LDL cholesterol 2.83...2.82 mmol/l mmol/l (p = 0.9), HDL cholesterol 1.13...1.27 mmol/l (p = 0.003), triglycerides 1.98...1.91 mmol/l (p = 0.01). Comparison between the 2 groups did not show any significant differences in lipid levels, patients react to sibutramine in the same way regardless to the concomitant statin therapy. We can therefore preliminarily conclude that sibutramine therapy has significant positive effect on the lipid profile even in patients who were started on statins prior to initiation of sibutramine treatment."
