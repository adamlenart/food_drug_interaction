Balb/c mice weighting 20-40g were randomly selected and divided into five groups of six each. The first group was designated as control group; and the second as the picrotoxin (10mg/kg; intraperitoneal) alone group. The rest of the groups were administered simvastatin in dozes of 10, 20 and 40mg/kg respectively. Onset, number and duration of seizures, and death time were measured in mice for one hour. At the end of the study, the brain was removed from mice and normal and degenerative pyramidal neurons were counted in hippocampal CA1, CA2, CA3 region by light microscope. Using SPSS 17, Mann=Whitney U and Chi square and student-T tests were performed for statistical analysis.",

Risk factors for CVD, stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) were examined using a Cox proportional hazards model. In addition, the effect of statin therapy at baseline on CHD prevention was analyzed in dyslipidemic patients. The factors significantly related to CVD were female (hazard ratio [HR]\u2009=\u20090.637, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.428-0.948), older age (65-69 years: HR\u2009=\u20092.165, 95% CI 1.214-3.861; 70-74 years: HR\u2009=\u20092.324, 95% CI 1.294-4.174; \u226575 years: HR\u2009=\u20092.448, 95% CI 1.309-4.578), family history of CHD (HR\u2009=\u20091.993, 95% CI 1.249-3.179), diabetes (HR\u2009=\u20092.287, 95% CI 1.700-3.078), current smoking (HR\u2009=\u20092.289, 95% CI 1.512-3.466) and alcohol drinking socially (HR\u2009=\u20090.589, 95% CI 0.379-0.913). Diabetes was a risk factor for both stroke and CHD, while age, family history of CHD, and sodium intake score were risk factors for stroke alone. Sex, dyslipidemia, smoking and exercise habits were risk factors for CHD alone. The risk of CHD in dyslipidemic patients on statin treatment was comparable to the risk in patients without dyslipidemia (HR\u2009=\u20091.134, 95% CI 0.604-2.126). However, in dyslipidemic patients not on statin treatment, the HR increased to 1.807 (95% CI 1.156-2.825). In conclusion, some risk factors for CVD in hypertensive patients being treated with antihypertensive drugs with no history of CVD differed between CHD and stroke. These results suggest the importance of managing dyslipidemia with a statin for primary prevention of CHD, as well as the importance of hypertension therapy.",

Nine of 20 patients (45\u00a0%) experienced at least 1 episode of hypocholesterolemia (total cholesterol <3.1\u00a0mmol/L), and 2 patients required atorvastatin dose lowering. Transient mild increase of liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 45-60\u00a0U/L) were seen in 7 of 20 (35\u00a0%) patients with no patients experiencing more severe increases. Only one patient experienced increased creatine phosphokinase levels (>500\u00a0U/L).

We evaluated simultaneous vascular and metabolic responses to pravastatin and valsartan therapy, alone or in combination, in hypercholesterolemic patients. Forty-eight hypercholesterolemic patients (23 had metabolic syndrome) were given pravastatin 40 mg and placebo, pravastatin 40 mg and valsartan 160 mg, or valsartan 160 mg and placebo daily during each 2-month treatment period in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with three treatment arms and two washout periods (each 2 months). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and C-reactive protein improved to a greater extent with combined therapy compared with either monotherapy. Importantly, we also observed simultaneous improvement in metabolic phenotypes, with all three treatments causing increased plasma adiponectin levels, reduced fasting insulin levels, and increased insulin sensitivity relative to baseline measurements. For the first time in a statin combination trial, pravastatin combined with valsartan therapy increased plasma adiponectin, lowered fasting insulin levels, and improved insulin sensitivity in an additive manner when compared with monotherapy alone. In contrast to other statins, hydrophilic pavastatin may be combined with other drugs to safely reach lipid target levels while simultaneously improving the metabolic and cardiovascular phenotype of patients at high risk.",

Although several case reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported due to the combination of statin and fenofibrate, fenofibrate alone rarely causes rhabdomyolysis.

Forty-eight studies (64.0%) were industry-sponsored. Fifty-two (69.3%) articles compared statins versus non-active alternatives. Secondary CV prevention represented 42.7% of articles, followed by primary CV prevention (38.7%) and both (18.7%). Overall, industry-sponsored studies were much less likely to report unfavourable or neutral conclusions (0% versus 37.1%; p<0.001). For primary CV prevention, the proportion with unfavourable or neutral conclusions was 0% for industry-sponsored studies versus 57.9% for non-sponsored studies (p<0.001). Conversely, no statistically significant differences were identified for studies evaluating secondary CV prevention (0% versus 12.5%; p=0.222).

Nevertheless, most studies have been focused on women and only a few on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The measurement of carotid intimal-medial thickness (CIMT) is able to detect early atherosclerotic changes and is a predictive marker of cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was to assess the CIMT and its relationship with bone mineral density (BMD) (in the femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS)) in men with T2DM. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 24 men with T2DM (aged 61 \u00b1 6.4 years) and evaluated metabolic factors, bone densitometry values, and CIMT measured using B-mode Logic-E ultrasound machine. More than 5 years since the diagnosis of T2DM had passed in 75% of the patients, 41.6% were in statin use, mean body mass index (BMI) was 28.1 \u00b1 3.4 kg/m(2), abdominal circumference (AC) 97.8 \u00b1 8.4 cm, systolic blood pressure (SBP) 143.8 \u00b1 18.3 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 85.8 \u00b1 12.3 mmHg, HbA1C 7.5% \u00b1 1.3%, Triglycerides 141.7 \u00b1 73 mg/dL, LDL-cholesterol 103.3 \u00b1 35.9 mg/dL, HDL-cholesterol 41.6 \u00b1 11.6 mg/dL. The patients were stratified into groups according to BMD. The group with normal BMD at FN had mean CIMT of 0.7 mm and the group with low bone mass (osteopenia or osteoporosis) had CIMT of 0.86 mm (P = 0.007). In addition, there were no significant differences between groups regarding age, duration of T2DM, BMI, AC, SBP, DBP, statin use, smoking, HbA1C, cholesterol, or triglycerides. Our data demonstrate a negative association between BMD at the FN and CIMT in type 2 diabetic men, which was unrelated to the traditional risk factors for atherosclerotic disease and degree of diabetes control.", 
    "43": "Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-mass-accuracy tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS-MS) has been used for elucidation of the structures of oxidation products of atorvastatin (AT), one of the most popular commercially available drugs. The purpose of the study was identification of AT metabolites in rat hepatocytes and comparison with electrochemically generated oxidation products. AT was incubated with rat hepatocytes for 24\u00a0h. Electrochemical oxidation of AT was performed by use of a three-electrode off-line system with a glassy carbon working electrode. Three supporting electrolytes (0.1\u00a0mol\u00a0L(-1) H2SO4, 0.1\u00a0mol\u00a0L(-1) HCl, and 0.1\u00a0mol\u00a0L(-1) NaCl) were tested, and dependence on pH was also investigated. AT undergoes oxidation by a single irreversible process at approximately +1.0\u00a0V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode. The results obtained revealed a simple and relatively fast way of determining the type of oxidation and its position, on the basis of characteristic neutral losses (NLs) and fragment ions. Unfortunately, different products were obtained by electrochemical oxidation and biotransformation of AT. High-mass-accuracy measurement combined with different UHPLC-MS-MS scans, for example reconstructed ion-current chromatograms, constant neutral loss chromatograms, or exact mass filtering, enable rapid identification of drug-related compounds. \u03b2-Oxidation, aromatic hydroxylation of the phenylaminocarbonyl group, sulfation, AT lactone and glycol formation were observed in rat biotransformation samples. In contrast, a variety of oxidation reactions on the conjugated skeleton of isopropyl substituent of AT were identified as products of electrolysis.", 
    "44": "The process of conducting cell-based phenotypic screens can result in data sets from small libraries or portions of large libraries, making accurate hit picking from multiple data sets important for efficient drug discovery. Here, we describe a screen design and data analysis approach that allow for normalization not only between quadrants and plates but also between screens or batches in a robust, quantitative fashion, enabling hit selection from multiple data sets. We independently screened the MicroSource Spectrum and NCI Diversity Set II libraries using a cell-based phenotypic high-throughput screening (HTS) assay that uses an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)-driven luciferase-reporter assay to identify interferon (IFN) signal enhancers. Inclusion of a per-plate, per-quadrant IFN dose-response standard curve enabled conversion of ISRE activity to effective IFN concentrations. We identified 45 hits based on a combined z score \u22652.5 from the two libraries, and 25 of 35 available hits were validated in a compound concentration-response assay when tested using fresh compound. The results provide a basis for further analysis of chemical structure in relation to biological function.

Better utilization of evidence-based therapies in these patients may translate into improved outcomes.", 
    "49": "Growing evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various cardiac processes including cardiac hypertrophy. However, the modulation of miRNA by pharmacological intervention in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy has not been disclosed yet. methods: We constructed neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by angiotensin II stimulation and subjected to cardiomyocyte immunochemistry, qRT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis. In addition, we constructed the mouse cardiac hypertrophy using angomir-22 stimulation and demonstrated the potential antihypertrophic mechnism of atorvastatin.", 
    "50": "The results showed that a collection of miRNAs were aberrantly expressed in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes induced by angiotensin II stimulation. In addition, overexpression of miR-22 was found in angiotensin II-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, whereas administration of atorvastatin could reverse the upregulation of miRNA-22 nearly back to the control level. Furthermore, up-regulation of miRNA-22 in cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo could induce cardiac hypertrophy, which could suppress the protein level of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN). Concomitantly, the production of ANP, BNP and \u03b2-MHC was enhanced and cardiomyocyte size was increased. However, atorvastatin could markedly knockdown miRNA-22 expression and reverse these changes in cardiomyocytes. These results suggest that the contribution of atrovastatin to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy may be involved in downregulation of miRNA-22 expression, which modulates the activity of PTEN in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. conclusion: This study demonstrates for the first time the modulation of miRNA-22 can be achieved by pharmacological intervention. The data generated from this study provides a rationale for the development of miRNA-based strategies for antihypertrophic treatment.",

    "52": "30 patients with primary hyperlipidemia were recruited, treated with red rice yeast capsules 600 mg twice a day for 8 weeks, and followed up for 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the mean difference in LDL-C from baseline to week 8, while the secondary endpoints were the mean percentage changes from baseline of total cholesterol, TG, HDL-C, adiponectin, and leptin.",

Adiponectin also correlated positively with HDL-C (r2 = 0.39; p = 0.001). Serum leptin correlated negatively with TG (r2 = 0.19; p = 0.035), and there was a trend of correlation between leptin and HDL-C, but this was not statistically significant (r2 = 0.16; p = 0.052).",

    "55": "Statins have similar side effects that do not always occur at the same rate among the various statins. We present a case of simvastatin-induced muscle toxicity that disappeared when pravastatin was substituted for the original drug.", 
    "56": "A 74-year-old male, a nonsmoker, complained of severe nocturnal leg cramps. The patient also complained that similar painful cramping occurred when he walked rapidly or jogged. Because some components of his lipid panel exceeded the'desirable' range, and as he had a history of myocardial infarction, his family physician prescribed simvastatin (40 mg/day). The patient had taken this medication for the past eight years. The painful nocturnal episodes started two years ago and affected either one or the other leg. Four months ago we discontinued his simvastatin and prescribed pravastatin (80 mg/day). At a follow-up visit six weeks later, the patient reported that his leg pains at night and the pain experienced after brisk walking had disappeared. Four months after the substitution of pravastatin for simvastatin, the patient reported that his complete lack of symptoms had continued.", 
    "57": "These painful muscle cramps were probably caused by an inadequate vascular supply to the calf and foot muscles. Perhaps a combination of advanced age and atherosclerotic changes created a predisposition for the simvastatin-induced leg cramps. Pravastatin differs from simvastatin in several ways.l It is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 oxidases, and thus is not influenced by CYP 3A4 inhibitors like simvastatin. Also, simvastatin is associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms located within the SLCO1B1 gene on the chromosome 12 and established myopathy, while pravastatin lacks this association. These differences may contribute to increased tolerance to pravastatin in this particular case.", 
    "58": "Hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease; high-risk patients with HTG, such as those with metabolic syndrome or diabetes, may benefit from hypolipidaemic therapies. Several lipid-lowering drugs act by reducing triglyceride (TG) levels, including fibrates, nicotinic acid and omega-3 fatty acids. The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) dose-dependently reduce plasma TG levels; the effect tends to be greater in patients with higher TG levels at baseline. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that EPA+DHA doses of \u2265 2 g/day are required to achieve significant effects. The optimal TG-lowering doses of EPA+DHA are 3-4 g/day, with little evidence to support lipid-altering efficacy of doses of EPA and DHA <1g/day. Predicted changes in fasting serum TG levels at the recommended dietary intakes of EPA and/or DHA of 200-500 mg/day are -3.1% to -7.2%. Reductions of plasma TG levels at the optimal doses are from 25-35% up to 45% in the presence of severely elevated TG levels (\u2265 500 mg/dl; \u2265 5.65 mmol/l), along with a reduction in non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and an increase in HDL-C. This observation has also been confirmed in statin-treated patients.", 
    "59": "Plasma cholesterol levels in the Japanese people gradually increased until 1990, possibly due to the increase in dietary cholesterol. Japan Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases were released in 2012. The diagnostic values of LDL-C, TG and HDL-C for dyslipidemia are >or= 140 mg/dL, >or=150 mg/dL and <40 mg/dL, respectively. The guidelines emphasize that these figures do not indicate a need to start drug therapy, but are only for dyslipidemia screening. The set point of LDL-C for the prevention of atherosclerosis falls with the number of risk factors. The guidelines recommend LDL-C calculated from the Friedewald formula, because homogenous assay kits for LDL-C still have problems in terms of accuracy. It is obvious that long-term excessive cholesterol consumption affects the plasma cholesterol level. It is thus necessary to restrict dietary cholesterol intake, at least for hypercholesterolemic patients. If the effect of dietary therapy is insufficient, drug therapy should be taken into consideration. Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are most commonly used worldwide for hypercholesterolemic patients and fibrates are effective for hypertriglyceridemia. When we use these two drugs in patients with type IIb dyslipidemia, we should pay attention to side effects, including rhabdomyolysis. On the other hand, ezetimib is a new type of cholesterol-lowering drug and is an inhibitor of cholesterol transport in the small intestine. Thus, the combination of ezetimib and statins can reduce LDL-C more than therapy with each drug alone.", 
    "60": "The relationship between serum cholesterol and cardiovascular disease is well established. Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events involves the use of statins to reduce cholesterol levels, as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. This article provides an overview of fats and lipids within the body, and explores how statins work to reduce cholesterol. The risks and benefits of statin therapy are discussed, including food and drug interactions, and optimum dose time.", 
    "61": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a strong, independent risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) and cerebrovascular outcomes. Meta-analysis of five randomised clinical trials (n = 33,040) showed that, although intensive versus standard glycaemic control significantly reduced CV events in people with T2D, the reduction was less than that achieved with lipid-lowering or antihypertensive treatment. Furthermore, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations were a modest predictor for CV risk in people without T2D. Thus, although effective glycaemic control is important for the prevention/management of T2D, other risk factors must be addressed to effectively reduce CV risk. Reducing low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels using statins significantly reduces CV risk in people with and without T2D. Although statins are generally safe and well tolerated, conflicting data exist regarding the diabetogenic effects of some statins. Based on recent clinical trial data, the US Food and Drug Administration have changed the labelling of all statins to include 'an effect of statins on incident diabetes and increases in haemoglobin A1c and/or FPG'. However, the literature suggests that the beneficial effects of most statins on CV risk continue to outweigh their diabetogenic risks and that statins should remain as first-line therapy for the majority of people with dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome or T2D. Mechanisms explaining the potentially higher incidence of T2D with statin therapy have not been confirmed. However, independent predictors for statin-associated T2D appear to include elevated levels of baseline FPG, BMI, blood pressure and fasting triglycerides. Moreover, although some statins (for example, atorvastatin) are associated with increased haemoglobin A1c levels in patients receiving intensive but not moderate therapy, other statins (for example, pitavastatin) have demonstrated neutral or favourable effects on glucose control in patients with and without T2D or metabolic syndrome. The potential diabetogenic effects of statins may therefore differ between drugs. In conclusion, conflicting data exist regarding the diabetogenic effects of statins. Further studies are required to understand whether all statins have the same effect and whether some patient groups are at higher risk than others. Meanwhile, results suggest that the net CV benefit favours the use of statin therapy in patients with dyslipidaemia, irrespective of T2D risk.", 
    "62": "Statins effectively lower low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and reduce cardiovascular risk in people with dyslipidemia and cardiometabolic diseases such as Metabolic syndrome (MetS) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). In addition to elevated levels of LDL-C, people with these conditions often have other lipid-related risk factors, such as high levels of triglycerides, low levels of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and a preponderance of highly atherogenic, small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles. The optimal management of dyslipidemia in people with MetS or T2D should therefore address each of these risk factors in addition to LDL-C. Although statins typically have similar effects on LDL-C levels, differences in chemical structure and pharmacokinetic profile can lead to variations in pleiotropic effects, adverse event profiles and drug-drug interactions. The choice of statin should therefore depend on the characteristics and needs of the individual patient. Compared with other statins, pitavastatin has distinct pharmacological features that translate into a broad range of actions on both apolipoprotein-B-containing and apolipoprotein-A-containing lipoproteins. Studies show that pitavastatin 1 to 4 mg is well tolerated and significantly improves LDL-C and triglyceride levels to a similar or greater degree than comparable doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin or pravastatin, irrespective of diabetic status. Moreover, whereas most statins show inconsistent effects on HDL-C levels, pitavastatin-treated patients routinely experience clinically significant elevations in HDL-C that are maintained and even increased over the long term. In addition to increasing high-density lipoprotein quantity, pitavastatin appears to improve high-density lipoprotein function and to slow the progression of atherosclerotic plaques by modifying high-density lipoprotein-related inflammation and oxidation, both of which are common in patients with MetS and T2D. When choosing a statin, it is important to note that patients with MetS have an increased risk of developing T2D and that some statins can exacerbate this risk via adverse effects on glucose regulation. Unlike many statins, pitavastatin appears to have a neutral and even beneficial effect on glucose regulation, making it a useful treatment option in this high-risk group of patients. Together with pitavastatin's beneficial effects on the cardiometabolic lipid profile and its low potential for drug-drug interactions, this suggests that pitavastatin might be a useful lipid-lowering option for people with cardiometabolic disease.", 
    "63": "The term cardiometabolic disease encompasses a range of lifestyle-related conditions, including Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), that are characterized by different combinations of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, including dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia/insulin resistance, and vascular inflammation. These risk factors individually and interdependently increase the risk of CV and cerebrovascular events, and represent one of the biggest health challenges worldwide today. CV diseases account for almost 50% of all deaths in Europe and around 30% of all deaths worldwide. Furthermore, the risk of CV death is increased twofold to fourfold in people with T2D. Whilst the clinical management of CV disease has improved in Western Europe, the pandemic of obesity and T2D reduces the impact of these gains. This, together with the growing, aging population, means the number of CV deaths is predicted to increase from 17.1 million worldwide in 2004 to 23.6 million in 2030. The recommended treatment for MetS is lifestyle change followed by treatment for the individual risk factors. Numerous studies have shown that lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels using statins can significantly reduce CV risk in people with and without T2D or MetS. However, the risk of major vascular events in those attaining the maximum levels of LDL-C-reduction is only reduced by around one-third, which leaves substantial residual risk. Recent studies suggest that low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (<1 .0 mmol/l; 40 mg/dl) and high triglyceride levels (\u22651.7 mmol/l; 150 mg/dl) are independent risk factors for CV disease and that the relationship between HDL-C and CV risk persists even when on-treatment LDL-C levels are low (<1.7 mmol/l; 70 mg/dl). European guidelines highlight the importance of reducing residual risk by targeting these risk factors in addition to LDL-C. This is particularly important in patients with T2D and MetS because obesity and high levels of glycated hemoglobin are directly related to low levels of HDL-C and high triglyceride. Although most statins have a similar low-density lipoprotein-lowering efficacy, differences in chemical structure and pharmacokinetic profile can lead to variations in pleiotropic effects (for example, high-density lipoprotein-elevating efficacy), adverse event profiles, and drug-drug interactions. The choice of statin should therefore depend on the needs of the individual patient. The following reviews will discuss the potential benefits of pitavastatin versus other statins in the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia and MetS or T2D, focusing on its effects on HDL-C quantity and quality, its potential impact on atherosclerosis and CV risk, and its metabolic characteristics that reduce the risk of drug interactions. Recent controversies surrounding the potentially diabetogenic effects of statins will also be discussed.", 
    "64": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with impaired platelet response to clopidogrel. In patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) while on standard-dose clopidogrel, high-dose atorvastatin enhances the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of double-dose clopidogrel. It is unknown if similar effects are achieved in patients with DM. This study compare the PD effects of high-dose atorvastatin associated with double dose clopidogrel in HTPR patients with and without DM undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This is a post hoc analysis of a prospective randomized PD study that compared double-dose (150 mg) clopidogrel associated with high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin to double-dose clopidogrel alone in statin na\u00efve patients with HTPR undergoing elective PCI. In this analysis, patients were divided in two groups according to DM (n = 27) and non-DM (n = 49) status. Platelet reactivity was evaluated immediately before PCI and at 30 days using the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay. HTPR was defined as P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) \u2265235. Administering high-dose atorvastatin in addition to high-dose clipodogrel, the 30 days absolute PRU changes (106 \u00b1 75 vs 100 \u00b1 42, p = 0.7) and optimal response rates (83 vs 84%; p = 0.9) were similar in DM and non-DM patients. The baseline variables significantly associated with 30-day optimal response to high-dose clopidogrel were: atorvastatin treatment (OR = 7.5 [95% CI 1.19-47]; p = 0.032) in DM patients; PRU values (OR = 0.9 [95% CI 0.95-0.99]; p = 0.031) and creatinine clearance (OR = 1.07 [95% CI 1.008-1.13]; p = 0.025) in non-DM patients.

In this study, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography hyphenated with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was employed for elucidation of the mass fragmentation patterns of decalins by collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS). Based on the MS/MS fragmentation patterns of the authentic decalin standards as well as high mass accuracy, a new decalin in the crude extract of red yeast rice was further putatively identified. Moreover, a quantitative analysis method of five immunosuppressive decalins by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography hyphenated with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QQQ-MS) under multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was developed and validated. This method exhibits limits of detection from 0.44 to 1.96mg/kg, and precision variations were less than 3.2%, and the recovery was in the range of 82 and 105% with RSD less than 5.4%. This method was successfully applied in the quantitative analysis of decalins in different types of red yeast rice.

    "77": "Skeletal tissue undergoes continuous remodeling which makes it unique among other body tissues. Osteoporosis is a common bone metabolic disorder affecting both men and women. Osteoporosis and its complications mainly osteoporotic fractures, have a high impact on health and economy. Current approved medications are associated with numerous side effects, which limit their use. Identification of a new and safe therapy is mandatory. Statins, also known as HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, are frequently used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and for the prevention of morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease. Statins improved bone health status in intact and ovariectomised rodents following high clinically intolerable oral doses. However, this beneficial effect of statins could not be significantly demonstrated in humans. The reason behind this discrepancy might be due to the safety and bioavailability of the currently used oral statins. Vitamin E, especially the tocotrienols at the dose 60 mg/kg/day provided significant antiosteoporotic effects in different animal models of osteoporosis. The use of the aforementioned dose of tocotrienols was shown to be safe in both humans and animals. Enhancement of bone formation and reduction of bone resorption were achieved more effectively by a combination of tocotrienols and statins than by either treatment when supplemented separately at clinically tolerable doses. Therefore, the adverse effects associated with high statin doses might be avoided with the coadministration of tocotrienols. Moreover, the combination therapy strategy might be useful for patients who are at high risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular events and hypercholesterolaemia.",

Atorvastatin has been shown to be neuroprotective after transient ischaemia or traumatic injury. The aim of this study was to establish if systemic administration of Atorvastatin could improve functional muscle reinnervation after complete sciatic nerve section. Sixteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. After a complete right sciatic nerve section, end-to-end microsuture repair was performed and fibrin glue was added. Three groups were studied: (1) sutures (S) + fibrin glue (F) only + saline administration for 14 days; (2) S+F+Atorvastatin administration for 14 days; and (3) uninjured nerve. Five months later, the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle were isolated to perform in vivo electrophysiological measurements. Better kinematics was observed in atorvastatin-treated rats 5 months after its administration. Indeed, a larger excursion of the hip-ankle-toe angle during walking was observed. This effect was associated with the preservation of electromyographic activity (2.91 mV vs 0.77 mV) and maximal muscle force (85.1 g vs 28.6 g) on stimulation of the proximal nerve section. Five months after a neurotmetic lesion, the recovery is incomplete when using suture and fibrin glue only.

Psoriasis was associated with metabolic disorder and therefore the present study was performed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of combination of blackseed with garlic as a treatment for dyslipidemia. A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, two arms parallel study consisted of 4 week diet stabilization period that included a 4 week base line evaluation phase, followed by an 8 week treatment period. The study comprised men (n=127) and women (n=131) aged 24 to 57 years, who met the NCEP ATP III criteria for drug treatment of hyperlipidemia and dietary intervention. Three hundred patients were randomized to treatment and 258 completed the study. The lipid profile included total cholesterol, HDL-C, Non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and Triglyceride. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups at the baseline for triglyceride, HDL, Non-HDL, LDL and total cholesterol. Following 8 weeks treatment with simvastatin plus placebo the reduction in Non-HDL, triglyceride, LDL and total cholesterol following treatment course was statistically highly significant (P= <0.01). However, the increase in HDL was significant (P=0.02). Patients who received simvastatin, plus black seed and garlic for 8 weeks of treatment show significant differences between baseline and after treatment course for all tested profiles (P=<0.01). This comparison of mean values reveals a high significant difference (P=<0.01) for cholesterol, triglyceride, Non-HDL, and LDL, and significant difference (P=0.03) for HDL between the two treatment groups. This study suggests that the evaluated combination was effective in correction of dyslipidemia. Large scale clinical trials comparing different doses are warranted.",

Both conditions incur significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the prognosis of COPD and HF combined is poorer than for either disease alone. Nevertheless, usually only one of them is diagnosed. An active search for each condition using clinical examination and additional tests including plasma natriuretic peptides, lung function testing, and echocardiography should be obtained. The combination of COPD and HF presents many therapeutic challenges. The beneficial effects of selective \u03b21-blockers should not be denied in stable patients who have HF and coexisting COPD. Additionally, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin-receptor blockers may reduce the morbidity and mortality of COPD patients. Moreover, caution is advised with use of inhaled \u03b22-agonists for the treatment of COPD in patients with HF. Finally, noninvasive ventilation, added to conventional therapy, improves the outcome of patients with acute respiratory failure due to hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD or HF in situations of acute pulmonary edema. The establishment of a combined and integrated approach to managing these comorbidities would seem an appropriate strategy. Additional studies providing new data on the pathogenesis and management of patients with COPD and HF are needed, with the purpose of trying to improve quality of life as well as survival of these patients.", 
    "89": "Dyslipidemia and chronic inflammation may play a role in the cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in older men. Use of statin drugs, which are prescribed to lower cholesterol and appear to reduce inflammation, may decrease the incidence or progression of LUTS. The associations of statin drug use with LUTS incidence and progression were prospectively evaluated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study from 1992 to 2008. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of incident LUTS (from no or a low International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) of 0-7 to a moderate or worse IPSS of \u226515; n = 5,790 cases in 24,715 men) and of LUTS progression (from modest IPSS of 8-14 to severe IPSS of \u226520; n = 2,238 cases in 8,709 men) were calculated comparing current statin use with nonuse. The hazard ratios of LUTS incidence and progression comparing current use to nonuse were greater than 1. However, when comparisons were restricted to participants who used drugs to treat hypertension (a surrogate for uptake of medical care), statin use was not associated with LUTS incidence (hazard ratio = 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.12) or progression (hazard ratio = 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.85, 1.13). Thus, statin use is unlikely to beneficially influence the development or course of LUTS. The present study highlights a methodological issue (confounding) that must be addressed in observational studies on the use of common drugs for indications other than the primary use.", 
    "90": "Within the context of novel stent designs we developed a dual drug-eluting stent (DDES) with an abluminally focussed release of the potent anti-proliferative drug sirolimus and a luminally focussed release of atorvastatin with stabilizing effect on atherosclerotic deposits and stimulating impact on endothelial function, both from biodegradable poly(L-lactide)-based stent coatings. With this concept we aim at simultaneous inhibition of in-stent restenosis as a result of disproportionally increased smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration as well as thrombosis due to failed or incomplete endothelialisation. The especially adapted spray-coating processes allowed the formation of smooth form-fit polymer coatings at the abluminal and luminal side with 70% respectively 90% of the drug/polymer solution being deposited at the intended stent surface. The impacts of tempering, sterilization, and layer composition on drug release are thoroughly discussed making use of a semi-empirical model. While tempering at 80 \u00b0C seems to be necessary for the achievement of adequate and sustained drug release, the coating sequence for DDES should be rather abluminal-luminal than luminal-abluminal, as reduction of the amount of sirolimus eluted luminally could then potentially minimize the provocation of endothelial dysfunction. In vitro proliferation and viability assays with smooth muscle and endothelial cells underline the high potential of the developed DDES.", 
    "91": "Recent studies showed that statins reduce ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages, whereas the effect of statins on ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 (ABCG1), another important lipid transporter, is still unclear. Here, we investigated the expression and functionality of ABCG1 on statins in THP-1-derived macrophages and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Simvastatin and atorvastatin were used in this study. Treatment with statins significantly decreased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux in human macrophages (from 33.8% \u00b1 2.8% of control to 22.9% \u00b1 1.7% of 10 \u00b5M simvastatin or to 23.3% \u00b1 3.3% of 10 \u00b5M atorvastatin; P < 0.01, n = 4), whereas the protein expression of ABCG1 remained unaltered on statins. Further analysis revealed that 2 major ABCG1 isoforms responded to statins differently. The expression of ABCG1-S, which exhibited higher activity in cholesterol efflux than ABCG1-L, was significantly decreased on statins compared with increased expression of ABCG1-L. The results suggested that the proportion change of ABCG1 isoform expressions could contribute to reduced ABCG1 functionality under treatment with statins. The effects of statins on ABCG1 isoform expression and functionality were reversed by low-dose liver X receptor agonist, TO-901317, indicating that statins' downregulation of ABCG1 functionality was likely through liver X receptor-dependent pathway. In conclusion, simvastatin and atorvastatin decreased ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux in human macrophages without alteration of total ABCG1 protein level. The proportion change of ABCG1 isoforms expressions may be involved in the down-regulation of ABCG1 functionality by statins, which provided a novel mechanism for the regulation of ABCG1 activity.", 
    "92": "Our recent in vitro experiments suggest that fluvastatin may influence tyrosinase (key enzyme of melanogenesis) synthesis. The aim of the present study was to verify those findings in experiments, in vitro, in melanoma cell line, and in vivo, in mice. The expression of tyrosinase in B16F10 melanoma cell line, after induction of melanogenesis by UVB irradiation, was examined by Western blot analysis. Afterwards, the effect of fluvastatin on melanin synthesis in hair follicles of C57Bl/6 mice was investigated. The expression of tyrosinase was reduced in the presence of fluvastatin. In mice after anagen induction over the dorsal skin, gel containing fluvastatin in various concentrations was injected subcutaneously, while in part of control groups of mice, gel with placebo was injected. In addition, gel with fluvastatin was injected to four week-old mice (mice in first postnatal anagen) without anagen induction. In extension, injections of gel with fluvastatin or placebo were performed in mice without anagen induction (but after first postnatal anagen). In part of study group of mice (mice after anagen induction and injection of fluvastatin) regrowth of depigmented hair was observed, while in all control groups (mice after injection of placebo), such hair depigmentation over the skin area was not found. In conclusion, this study, for the first time, shows that fluvastatin might affect melanin synthesis in vivo.",

    "94": "We analyzed the cardiovascular phenotype of 19 FPLD2 patients aged >30 years with LMNA p.R482 heterozygous substitutions, and the effects of p.R482W-prelamin-A overexpression in human coronary artery endothelial cells. In 68% of FPLD2 patients, early atherosclerosis was attested by clinical cardiovascular events, occurring before the age of 45 in most cases. In transduced endothelial cells, exogenous wild-type-prelamin-A was correctly processed and localized, whereas p.R482W-prelamin-A accumulated abnormally at the nuclear envelope. Patients' fibroblasts also showed a predominant nuclear envelope distribution with a decreased rate of prelamin-A maturation. Only p.R482W-prelamin-A induced endothelial dysfunction, with decreased production of NO, increased endothelial adhesion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and cellular senescence. p.R482W-prelamin-A also induced oxidative stress, DNA damages, and inflammation. These alterations were prevented by treatment of endothelial cells with pravastatin, which inhibits prelamin-A farnesylation, or with antioxidants. In addition, pravastatin allowed the correct relocalization of p.R482W-prelamin-A within the endothelial cell nucleus. These data suggest that farnesylated p.R482W-prelamin-A accumulation at the nuclear envelope is a toxic event, leading to cellular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction.",

    "100": "Ischemia reperfusion injuries can be threatening to end organ viability and can progress, with mortal and morbid outcomes. In particular, neural tissues are highly sensitive to hypoxia and reperfusion stress. This study aimed to determine the neuroprotective effects of rosuvastatin on spinal cord ischemia reperfusion injury. Forty male Sprague- Dawley rats were divided into four equal groups: group I (control), group II (sham with simple laparotomy), group III (ischemia-reperfusion), group IV (ischemia-reperfusion group with continuous rosuvastatin utilization), and group V (ischemia-reperfusion group with rosuvastatin-withdrawal after reperfusion). Spinal cord ischemia was induced by clamping the aorta below the left renal artery and above the aortic bifurcation. Reperfusion was provided after 72(nd) hours of ischemia. After reperfusion, blood samples and spinal cord tissue samples were taken from all the rats. Oxidative and antioxidant markers from both serum and tissue samples were evaluated, and tissues were examined histopathologically. There were no significant differences between the control and sham groups. A notable increase in oxidative markers was observed in group III compared to group I. In addition, a significant decrease in antioxidant markers was detected in group III. However, there was a marked preservation in the tissue and blood samples of groups IV and V compared to group III in terms of oxidative damage. Additionally, definitive prophylaxes were seen in the histopathological examination of the tissue samples in groups IV and V compared with group III. These significant findings show that rosuvastatin has a considerable protective effect on neural tissue against oxidative damage. Likewise, the early withdrawal of rosuvastatin has a clear neuroprotective effect similar to that of continuous therapy. Nevertheless, other systematic effects and beneficial neural effects of statins should be investigated in further clinical trials.",

For this purpose, the key is to select pest control genes with the greatest potential for developing effective pest control treatments. The present study demonstrated that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase; HMGR) gene is a potential target for insect control using RNAi. HMGR is a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway in insects. A complete cDNA encoding full length HMGR (encoding an 837-aa protein) was cloned from Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The HaHMGR (H. armigera HMGR) knockdown using systemic RNAi in vivo inhibited the fecundity of the females, effectively inhibited ovipostion, and significantly reduced vitellogenin (Vg) mRNA levels. Moreover, the oviposition rate of the female moths was reduced by 98% by silencing HaHMGR compared to the control groups. One-pair experiments showed that both the proportions of valid mating and fecundity were zero. Furthermore, the HaHMGR-silenced females failed to lay eggs (approximate 99% decrease in oviposition) in the semi-field cage performance. The present study demonstrated the potential implications for developing novel pest management strategies using HaHMGR RNAi in the control of H. armigera and other insect pests.",

Despite evidence for an atheroprotective effect of niacin from previous small clinical studies, the large outcome trials, AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE did not reveal additional beneficial effects of niacin (alone or in combination with laropiprant) on top of statin treatment. We aimed to address this apparent discrepancy by investigating the effects of niacin without and with simvastatin on atherosclerosis development and determine the underlying mechanisms, in APOE*3Leiden.CETP mice, a model for familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (FD).",

Similarly as in FD patients, niacin reduced total cholesterol by -39% and triglycerides by -50%, (both P<0.001). Simvastatin and the combination reduced total cholesterol (-30%; -55%, P<0.001) where the combination revealed a greater reduction compared to simvastatin (-36%, P<0.001). Niacin decreased total cholesterol and triglycerides primarily by increasing VLDL clearance. Niacin increased HDL-cholesterol (+28%, P<0.01) and mildly increased reverse cholesterol transport. All treatments reduced monocyte adhesion to the endothelium (-46%; -47%, P<0.01; -53%, P<0.001), atherosclerotic lesion area (-78%; -49%, P<0.01; -87%, P<0.001) and severity. Compared to simvastatin, the combination increased plaque stability index [(SMC+collagen)/macrophages] (3-fold, P<0.01).

The additive effect of niacin on top of simvastatin is mostly dependent on its nonHDL-cholesterol-lowering capacities. These data suggest that clinical beneficial effects of niacin are largely dependent on its ability to lower LDL-cholesterol on top of concomitant lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "115": "We earlier documented that lovastatin (LOV)-mediated inhibition of small Rho GTPases activity protects vulnerable oligodendrocytes (OLs) in mixed glial cell cultures stimulated with Th1 cytokines and in a murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the precise mechanism of OL protection remains unclear. We here employed genetic and biochemical approaches to elucidate the underlying mechanism that protects LOV treated OLs from Th1 (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1) and Th17 (interleukin-17) cytokines toxicity in in vitro. Cytokines enhanced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane depolarization with corresponding lowering of glutathione (reduced) level in OLs and that were reverted by LOV. In addition, the expression of ROS detoxifying enzymes (catalase and superoxide-dismutase 2) and the transactivation of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b1/-\u03b2/-\u03b3 including PPAR-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 were enhanced by LOV in similarly treated OLs. Interestingly, LOV-mediated inhibition of small Rho GTPases, i.e., RhoA and cdc42, and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) activity enhanced the levels of PPAR ligands in OLs via extracellular signal regulated kinase (1/2)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/cytoplasmic phospholipase 2/cyclooxygenase-2 signaling cascade activation. Small hairpin RNA transfection-based studies established that LOV mainly enhances PPAR-\u03b1 and less so of PPAR-\u03b2 and PPAR-\u03b3 transactivation that enhances ROS detoxifying defense in OLs. In support of this, the observed LOV-mediated protection was lacking in PPAR-\u03b1-deficient OLs exposed to cytokines. Collectively, these data provide unprecedented evidence that LOV-mediated inhibition of the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway boosts ROS detoxifying defense in OLs via PPAR-\u03b1-dependent mechanism that has implication in neurodegenerative disorders including MS.",

Based on these calculation results three simvastatin prodrugs were designed with the potential to provide simvastatin with higher bioavailability. For example, based on the calculated log EM for the three proposed prodrugs, the interconversion of simvastatin prodrug ProD 3 to simvastatin is predicted to be about 10 times faster than that of either simvastatin prodrug ProD 1 or simvastatin ProD 2. Hence, the rate by which the prodrug releases the statin drug can be determined according to the structural features of the promoiety (Kirby's enzyme model).",

V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells are stimulated by self- and foreign prenyl pyrophosphate intermediates in isoprenoid synthesis. However, little is known about the molecular basis for this stimulation. We find that a mAb specific for butyrophilin 3 (BTN3)/CD277 Ig superfamily proteins mimics prenyl pyrophosphates. The 20.1 mAb stimulated V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cell clones regardless of their functional phenotype or developmental origin and selectively expanded blood V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells. The \u03b3\u03b4 TCR mediates 20.1 mAb stimulation because IL-2 is released by \u03b2(-) Jurkat cells transfected with V\u03b32V\u03b42 TCRs. 20.1 stimulation was not due to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) accumulation because 20.1 treatment of APC did not increase IPP levels. In addition, stimulation was not inhibited by statin treatment, which blocks IPP production. Importantly, small interfering RNA knockdown of BTN3A1 abolished stimulation by IPP that could be restored by re-expression of BTN3A1 but not by BTN3A2 or BTN3A3. Rhesus monkey and baboon APC presented HMBPP and 20.1 to human V\u03b32V\u03b42 T cells despite amino acid differences in BTN3A1 that localize to its outer surface. This suggests that the conserved inner and/or top surfaces of BTN3A1 interact with its counterreceptor. Although no binding site exists on the BTN3A1 extracellular domains, a model of the intracellular B30.2 domain predicts a basic pocket on its binding surface. However, BTN3A1 did not preferentially bind a photoaffinity prenyl pyrophosphate. Thus, BTN3A1 is required for stimulation by prenyl pyrophosphates but does not bind the intermediates with high affinity.",

The analysis of GAGs showed a significant increase in the A-20 group when compared to C group. The treatment induced remarkable alterations in the Achilles tendon and the response of the tissue seems to depend of the used statin dosage.

These differences probably reflect human evolutionary development. Thus the host response to influenza seems to be the major determinant of outcome. Outpatient statins are associated with reductions in hospitalizations and deaths due to sepsis and pneumonia. Inpatient statins are also associated with reductions in short-term pneumonia mortality. Other immunomodulatory agents--ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), PPAR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b1 agonists (glitazones and fibrates) and AMPK agonists (metformin)--also reduce mortality in patients with pneumonia (ACEIs, ARBs) or in mouse models of influenza (PPAR and AMPK agonists). In experimental studies, treatment has not increased virus replication. Thus effective management of influenza may not always require targeting the virus with vaccines or antiviral agents. Clinical investigators, not systems biologists, have been the first to suggest that immunomodulatory agents might be used to treat influenza patients, but randomized controlled trials will be needed to provide convincing evidence that they work. To guide the choice of which agent(s) to study, we need new types of laboratory research in animal models and clinical and epidemiological research in patients with critical illness. These studies will have crucial implications for global public health. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, timely and affordable supplies of vaccines and antiviral agents were unavailable to more than 90% of the world's people. In contrast, statins and other immunomodulatory agents are currently produced as inexpensive generics, global supplies are huge, and they would be available to treat patients in any country with a basic health care system on the first pandemic day. Treatment with statins and other immunomodulatory agents represents a new approach to reducing mortality caused by seasonal and pandemic influenza.", 
    "194": "The standard approach to determine unique or shared genetic factors across populations is to identify risk alleles in one population and investigate replication in others. However, since populations differ in DNA sequence information, allele frequencies, effect sizes, and linkage disequilibrium patterns, SNP association using a uniform stringent threshold on p values may not be reproducible across populations. Here, we developed rank-based methods to investigate shared or population-specific loci and pathways for childhood asthma across individuals of diverse ancestry. We performed genome-wide association studies on 859,790 SNPs genotyped in 527 affected offspring trios of European, African, and Hispanic ancestry using publically available asthma database in the Genotypes and Phenotypes database.", 
    "195": "Rank-based analyses showed that there are shared genetic factors for asthma across populations, more at the gene and pathway levels than at the SNP level. Although the top 1,000 SNPs were not shared, 11 genes (RYR2, PDE4D, CSMD1, CDH13, ROBO2, RBFOX1, PTPRD, NPAS3, PDE1C, SEMA5A, and CTNNA2) mapped by these SNPs were shared across populations. Ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2, a statin response-related gene) showed the strongest association in European (p value=2.55\u00d710(-7)) and was replicated in African (2.57\u00d710(-4)) and Hispanic (1.18\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-3)) Americans. Imputation analyses based on the 1000 Genomes Project uncovered additional RYR2 variants associated with asthma. Network and functional ontology analyses revealed that RYR2 is an integral part of dermatological or allergic disorder biological networks, specifically in the functional classes involving inflammatory, eosinophilic, and respiratory diseases.", 
    "196": "Our rank-based genome-wide analysis revealed for the first time an association of RYR2 variants with asthma and replicated previously discovered PDE4D asthma gene across human populations. The replication of top-ranked asthma genes across populations suggests that such loci are less likely to be false positives and could indicate true associations. Variants that are associated with asthma across populations could be used to identify individuals who are at high risk for asthma regardless of genetic ancestry.",

Moreover, recent data suggest that statin pre-treatment is associated with a better short- and long-term outcome in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Current guidelines for coronary revascularization recommend the use of high-dose of statins before percutaneous coronary intervention to reduce the risk of periprocedural myocardial infarction in statin na\u00efve patients (class IIa A) and in those on chronic statin therapy (class IIa B). However, the beneficial clinical effects elicited by statins in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty may arise not only from a cardiac protection against periprocedural myocardial injury but also from a renal protection against acute kidney injury caused by iodinated contrast media. Actually, statins exert multiple non-lipid lowering (pleiotropic) effects, including improved endothelial function, reduced inflammatory and immuno-modulatory processes, oxidative stress and platelet adhesion, that may contribute to both cardio- and nephro-protection even in the short-term.", 
    "207": "We have previously demonstrated the ability of lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of mevalonate synthesis, to induce tumor-specific apoptosis. The apoptotic effects of lovastatin were regulated in part by the integrated stress response (ISR) that regulates cellular responses to a wide variety of stress inducers. A key regulator of the ISR apoptotic response is activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and its target gene CHOP/GADD153. In our study, we demonstrate that in multiple lovastatin-resistant clones of the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell line SCC9, lovastatin treatment (1-25 \u03bcM, 24 hr) in contrast to the parental line failed to significantly induce ATF3 expression. Furthermore, the SCC-derived cell lines SCC25 and HeLa that are sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptosis also preferentially induce ATF3 expression compared to resistant breast (MCF-7) and prostate carcinoma (PC3)-derived cell lines. In HeLa cells shRNA targeting ATF3 expression as well as in ATF3-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis were attenuated. In ex vivo HNSCC tumors, lovastatin also induced ATF3 mRNA expression in two of four tumors evaluated. Salubrinal, an agent that can sustain the activity of a key regulator of the ISR eIF2\u03b1, further increased the expression of ATF3 and demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity in combination with lovastatin in SCC cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate preferential induction of ATF3 in lovastatin-sensitive tumor-derived cell lines that regulate lovastatin-induced apoptosis. Importantly, combining lovastatin with salubrinal enhanced ATF3 expression and induced synergistic cytotoxicity in SCC cells.", 
    "208": "Patients undergoing vascular surgery are a high-risk population with widespread atherosclerosis, an adverse cardiovascular risk profile and often multiple co-morbidities. Postoperative cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarct (MI), are common. Statins are the medical treatment of choice to reduce high cholesterol levels. Evidence is accumulating that patients taking statins at the time of surgery are protected against a range of perioperative complications, but the specific benefits for patients undergoing noncardiac vascular surgery are not clear.", 
    "209": "We examined whether short-term statin therapy, commenced before or on the day of noncardiac vascular surgery and continuing for at least 48 hours afterwards, improves patient outcomes including the risk of complications, pain, quality of life and length of hospital stay. We also examined whether the effect of statin therapy on these outcomes changes depending on the dose of statin received.",

We employed the Chi(2) test and calculated the I(2) statistic to investigate study heterogeneity.", 
    "213": "We identified six eligible studies in total. The six Included studies were generally of high quality, but the largest eligible study was excluded because of concerns about its validity. Study populations were statin naive, which led to a considerable loss of eligible participants.Five RCTs compared statin use with placebo or standard care. We pooled results from three studies, with a total of 178 participants, for mortality and non-fatal event outcomes. In the statin group, 7/105 (6.7%) participants died within 30 days of surgery, as did 10/73 (13.7%) participants in the control group. Only one death in each group was from cardiovascular causes, with an incidence of 0.95% in statin participants and 1.4% in control participants, respectively. All deaths occurred in a single study population, and so effect estimates were derived from one study only. The risk ratio (RR) of all-cause mortality in statin users showed a non-significant decrease in risk (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.75). For cardiovascular death, the risk ratio was 1.05 (95% CI 0.07 to 16.20). Non-fatal MI within 30 days of surgery was reported in three studies and occurred in 4/105 (3.8%) participants in the statin group and 8/73 (11.0%) participants receiving placebo, for a non-significant decrease in risk (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.52). Several studies reported muscle enzyme levels as safety measures, but only three (with a total of 188 participants) reported explicitly on clinical muscle syndromes, with seven events reported and no significant difference found between statin users and controls (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.63). The only participant-reported outcome was nausea in one small study,with no significant difference in risk between groups.Two studies compared different doses of atorvastatin, with a total of 145 participants, but reported data were not sufficient to allow us to determine the effect of higher doses on any outcome.", 
    "214": "Evidence was insufficient to allow review authors to conclude that statin use resulted in either a reduction or an increase in any of the outcomes examined. The existing body of evidence leaves questions about the benefits of perioperative use of statins for vascular surgery unanswered. Widespread use of statins in the target population means that it may now be difficult for researchers to undertake the large RCTs needed to demonstrate any effect on the incidence of postoperative cardiovascular events. However, participant-reported outcomes have been neglected and warrant further study.", 
    "215": "Studies were carried out to investigate the charge-transfer (CT) reaction of ROS-Ca, as a n-electron donor with various p-acceptors: tetracyanoethylene, p-chloranilic acid, 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone, 2,3,5,6-tetrabromo-1,4-benzoquinone, 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone, 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-quinodimethane, and 2,4,7-trinitro-9-fluorenone. Different colored CT complexes were obtained. The reaction mechanism and site of interaction were determined by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometric techniques and computational molecular modeling. The formation of the colored complexes was utilized in the development of simple, rapid and accurate spectrophotometric methods for the determination of ROS-Ca. Under the optimum reaction conditions, linear relationships with good correlation coefficients (0.9984-0.9995) were found between the absorbances and the concentrations of ROS-Ca in the range of 2-200 mg mL\u207b\u00b9. The limits of detection ranged from 0.41 to 12.24 mg mL\u207b\u00b9. No interference could be observed from the additives commonly present in the tablets or from the drugs that are co-formulated with ROS-Ca in its combined formulations. The methods were successfully applied to the analysis of tablets with good accuracy and precision; the recovery percentages ranged from 99.54-100.46 \u00b1 1.58-1.82%. The results were compared favorably with the reported method. The proposed methods are practical and valuable for routine application in quality control laboratories for determination of ROS-Ca in its bulk form and tablets.",

Although the pathophysiological mechanism of AD is not fully elucidated, apart from \u03b2-amyloid and tau protein, a diverse number of factors such as cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, and lipids metabolism may play a significant role. Numerous epidemiological and laboratory studies support vascular injury and inflammation, as key pathological processes. The present review is focused on cardiovascular risk factors, lipids, and circulating biomarkers of inflammation, discussing them as independent mechanisms converging to the same final pathogenetic cascade of AD.", 
    "221": "The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of drugs in vivo are to a large extent dependent on different transport and metabolism routes. Elucidation of this complex transport-metabolism interplay is a major challenge in drug development and at present no in vitro models suitable for this purpose are at hand. The aim of this study was to develop flexible, well-controlled, easy-to-use, integrated cell models, where drug transport and drug metabolism processes could be studied simultaneously. HEK293 cells stably transfected with the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) were subjected to either transient transfection or adenoviral infection to introduce the genes expressing cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR), cytochrome b5 (CYB5A), and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1), in different combinations. Thereafter, the time and concentration-dependent transport and metabolism of two well-characterized statins, atorvastatin (acid and lactone forms) and simvastatin (acid form), were determined in the different models. The results show that CYP3A4-dependent metabolism of the more hydrophilic atorvastatin acid was dependent on OATP1B1 uptake and influenced by MDR1 efflux. In contrast, the metabolism of the more lipophilic atorvastatin lactone was not affected by active transport, whereas the metabolism of simvastatin acid was less influenced by active transport than atorvastatin acid. Our results, together with the models being applicative for any combination of drug transporters and CYP metabolizing enzymes of choice, provide proof-of-concept for the potential of the new integrated cell models presented as valuable screening tools in drug discovery and development.", 
    "222": "Statins have proven their effectiveness in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This class of drugs has also attracted attention as a potential treatment for dissimilar diseases such as certain types of cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. What appears to be a contradiction is that, in the case of cancer, it has been suggested that statins increase apoptosis and alter levels of Bcl-2 family members (e.g., reduce Bcl-2 and increase Bax), whereas studies mainly using noncancerous cells report opposite effects. This review examined studies reporting on the effects of statins on Bcl-2 family members, apoptosis, cell death, and cell protection. Much, but not all, of the evidence supporting the pro-apoptotic effects of statins is based on data in cancer cell lines and the use of relatively high drug concentrations. Studies indicating an anti-apoptotic effect of statins are fewer in number and generally used much lower drug concentrations and normal cells. Those conclusions are not definitive, and certainly, there is a need for additional research to determine if statin repositioning is justified for noncardiovascular diseases.", 
    "223": "Immunosuppressive treatment of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (iMN) is heavily debated. The controversy is mainly related to the toxicity of the therapy and the variable natural course of the disease-spontaneous remission occurs in 40-50% of patients. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Glomerulonephritis provides guidance for the treatment of iMN. The guideline suggests that immunosuppressive therapy should be restricted to patients with nephrotic syndrome and persistent proteinuria, deteriorating renal function or severe symptoms. Alkylating agents are the preferred therapy because of their proven efficacy in preventing end-stage renal disease. Calcineurin inhibitors can be used as an alternative although efficacy data on hard renal end points are limited. In this Review, we summarize the KDIGO guideline and address remaining areas of uncertainty. Better risk prediction is needed to identify patients who will benefit from immunosuppressive therapy, and the optimal timing and duration of this therapy is unknown because most of the randomized controlled trials were performed in low-risk or medium-risk patients. Alternative therapies, directed at B cells, are under study. The discovery of anti-M type phospholipase A2 receptor-antibodies is a major breakthrough and we envisage that in the near future, antibody-driven therapy will enable more individualized treatment of patients with iMN."
