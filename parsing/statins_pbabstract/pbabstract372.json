    "0": "Usual risk factors for coronary artery disease account for only 25-50% of increased atherosclerotic risk in diabetes mellitus. Other obvious risk factors are hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. However, hyperglycemia is a very late stage in the sequence of events from insulin resistance to frank diabetes, whereas lipoprotein abnormalities are manifested during the largely asymptomatic diabetic prodrome and contribute substantially to the increased risk of macrovascular disease. The insulin-resistant diabetes course affects virtually all lipids and lipoproteins. Chylomicron and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) remnants accumulate, and triglycerides enrich high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), leading to high levels of potentially atherogenic particles and low levels of HDL cholesterol. Hyperglycemia eventually impairs removal of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, the accumulation of which accentuates hypertriglyceridemia. As triglycerides increase-still within the so-called normal range-abnormalities in HDL and LDL became more apparent. Thus, when triglycerides are >200 mg/dL, LDL particles are small and dense (when they are <90 mg/dL, the particles are of the large, buoyant variety). The atherogenicity of small, dense LDL particles is attributed to their increased susceptibility to oxidation, but in many patients they may be a marker for insulin resistance or the presence of atherogenic VLDL. Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with atherosclerosis because (1) it is a marker for insulin resistance and atherogenic metabolic abnormalities; and (2) the small size of triglyceride-enriched lipoproteins enables them to infiltrate the blood vessel wall where they are oxidized, bind to receptors on macrophages, and ingested, leading to the development of the atherosclerotic lesion. Various studies (primary prevention with gemfibrozil: Helsinki Heart Study; secondary prevention with simvastatin and pravastatin: Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [4S] and Cholesterol and Recurrent Events [CARE], respectively) have demonstrated that lipid-lowering therapy in type 2 diabetes is effective in decreasing the number of cardiac events. Risk reduction was 22% to 50% (statins) and approximately 65% (fibrate) relative to placebo. It was also noted (in 4S and CARE) that the risk of major coronary events in untreated diabetic patients was 1.5-1.7-fold greater than in untreated nondiabetic patients. Although gemfibrozil (fibric acid derivative) is more effective in decreasing triglycerides and increasing HDL cholesterol in diabetic patients than the statins, it does not change and may even increase LDL-cholesterol levels (fenofibrate may be an exception, decreasing LDL cholesterol by 20-25% in some studies). However, gemfibrozil does increase LDL particle size. Nevertheless, the statins are the current lipid-lowering drugs of choice because the change in LDL-cholesterol-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio is better than with gemfibrozil. Moreover, the diabetic patient may be more likely to benefit from statin therapy than the nondiabetic patient. It should be noted that, in theory, nicotinic acid can correct or improve all lipid or lipoprotein abnormalities in patients with type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, it is relatively contraindicated because it causes insulin resistance and may precipitate or aggravate hyperglycemia (in addition to its other well-known side effects such as flushing, gastric irritation, development of hepatotoxicity, and hyperuricemia). It is unknown at present whether newer formulations such as once-daily Niaspan may be better tolerated in diabetes. In any case, most patients with type 2 diabetes have risk factors for coronary artery disease and qualify for aggressive LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy. At the same time, it is presently unknown whether improved glycemic control decreases coronary artery disease risk in such patients.", 
    "1": "Some xenobiotics induce membrane-bound drug metabolizing enzymes (Xme) and a profound proliferation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in vivo. However these effects are much weaker in vitro, possibly due to absence of certain transcription factors. We tested the possibility that ER proliferation can affect the level of ER-resident enzymes even in the absence of transcriptional activation. For this purpose we analysed the effects of compactin, which has been shown to induce ER proliferation in vitro, on recombinant Xme, which were expressed from a constitutive viral promoter. High levels of recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A6 were achieved by amplification of the UGT1A6 cDNA using the dihydrofolate reductase cDNA as selectable marker in DHFR- CHO cells. Treatment of the resulting cell lines with lipoprotein-deficient serum in the absence and presence of compactin for 5 days resulted in a 1.3- and 2.3-fold, respectively, increase of the UGT enzyme activity towards 4-methylumbelliferone, paralleled by an induction of immunoreactive UGT1A6 protein. Similarly, treatment with this 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor increased the endogenous P450 reductase activity 2.6-fold, concomitant with an increase of immunodetectable protein. As expected compactin induced the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Increased levels of this protein have been associated with a proliferation of the ER. Compactin treatment of a separate cell line that expressed recombinant human P450 reductase increased this enzyme activity fivefold. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the induction of the recombinant Xme by compactin was most likely due to decreased protein degradation. Our results show that enzyme systems unrelated to those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis are affected by compounds known to affect membrane biogenesis. Since this effect extends to heterologously expressed enzymes, it also provides an efficient means by which to increase the levels of recombinant ER proteins.",

Following publication of trial evidence and treatment guidelines for hypercholesterolaemia, we investigated the current practice of the management of hypercholesterolaemia in patients with coronary artery disease referred for coronary angiography by general physicians. We prospectively reviewed 156 consecutive patients (117 men; mean age 61.5+/-9.6 [S.D.] years) with a history of angina pectoris who attended the day case unit for coronary angiography in a 10 week period. Nearly a tenth of these patients had not been screened for hypercholesterolaemia in this study.

Using prospectively defined criteria, we assessed the incidence of stroke, a prespecified secondary end point, and transient ischemic attack (TIA) over a median 5-year follow-up period. Patients were well matched for stroke risk factors and the use of antiplatelet agents (85% of subjects in each group). Compared with placebo, pravastatin lowered total serum cholesterol by 20%, LDL cholesterol by 32%, and triglycerides by 14% and raised HDL cholesterol by 5% over the course of the trial. A total of 128 strokes (52 on pravastatin, 76 on placebo) and 216 strokes or TIAs (92 on pravastatin, 124 on placebo) were observed, representing a 32% reduction (95% CI, 4% to 52%, P=0.03) in all-cause stroke and 27% reduction in stroke or TIA (95% CI, 4% to 44%, P=0.02). All categories of strokes were reduced, and treatment effect was similar when adjusted for age, sex, history of hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, left ventricular ejection fraction, and baseline total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

Additional recovery groups of 8 rats each of both sexes receiving 0 and 10 mg/kg were maintained without treatment for 1 month in order to assess recovery. As a result, no toxicological changes were observed in general signs, body weight, food intake, ophthalmological examination, urinalysis, hematological and blood chemical examinations for organ weights. An autopsy revealed thickening of the forestomach mucosa in both sexes at a dose of 1 mg/kg or more. This change was microscopically recognized as hyperkeratosis and hypertrophy of the spinous layer associated with both cell infiltration of the mucosal propria and edema of sub-mucosa in the forestomach in both sexes at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg.

Macroscopic examination showed thickening of the forestomach mucosa in the groups of 10 mg/kg or more. Microscopic examination revealed hyperkeratosis and hypertrophy of the spinous layer associated with both cell infiltration of the mucosal propria and submucosal edema. In addition, skeletal muscle lesions including atrophy, vacuolation and focal necrosis were observed in the female dose groups at 50 and 100 mg/kg.

The ether layer was evaporated to dryness and the residue reconstituted in ammonium acetate (20 mM, pH 4.0)-acetonitrile-isopropanol (60:40:1, v/v/v). Chromatographic separation of analytes was achieved by using a YMC J'Sphere H80 (C-18) 150 x 2 mm, 4 microns particle size, column with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-0.1% acetic acid, (70:30, v/v). Analytes were detected by using MS/MS. Sample introduction and ionization was by electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode. The method proved suitable for routine quantitation of AT, o-AT, and p-AT over the concentration range of 0.250 to 25.0 ng/mL. Approximate retention time ranges of p-AT, o-AT, [d5]-o-AT, AT, and [d5]-AT were 2.27 +/- 0.21, 3.36 +/- 0.23, 3.54 +/- 0.46, 4.12 +/- 0.61, and 4.65 +/- 0.65 min, respectively.

Mean recoveries of AT, o-AT, and p-AT from plasma ranged 100%-107%, 70.6%-104%, and 47.6%-85.6%, respectively. Mean recoveries of the [d5]-AT and [d5]-o-AT internal standards ranged 98.0%-99.9% and 97.3%, respectively. Interassay precision, based on the percent relative deviation for replicate quality controls for AT, o-AT, and p-AT, was < or = 7.19%, 8.28%, and 12.7%, respectively.

AT, o-AT, and p-AT were stable frozen for 127, 30 and 270 days in human, dog, and rat plasma quality control samples, respectively. Human plasma quality control samples containing AT, o-AT, and p-AT were stable for at least 4 days at ambient room temperature and 37 degrees C.

    "17": "Health economics is about spending limited resources wisely and, as with so many fields in medicine, combines science with art and ingenuity. In order to know whether money is well spent it is necessary to have some reference points to make comparisons. Many accepted cardiovascular interventions, such as revascularization for multivessel disease (US$50000 per life year gained) or the use of a statin for hypercholesterolaemia in middle-aged men at high risk of cardiovascular events (US$30000 per life year gained) are associated with moderate expense. By contrast heart failure is one of the few conditions in which, under some circumstances, lives may be saved while significantly reducing costs. This article seeks to review currently available reports on the health economic consequences of interventions for heart failure and describes the development of a new health economic model. Digoxin, ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers all appear to be cost-effective under widely differing sets of assumptions. Estimates range from a substantial cost-saving to a few thousand dollars per life year gained. The major factor limiting the reduction in costs associated with effective treatment for heart failure (with the exception of digoxin) is the costs incurred as a consequence of improved longevity. Money spent on treating heart failure well is money wisely spent.", 
    "18": "Historically, a wide range of drugs have been used to treat hyperlipidemias. These include fibrates whose main action is to lower plasma triglycerides; bile-acid sequestering resins introduced to reduce plasma cholesterol; and more recently a family of statins designed to inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, HMG-CoA reductase. Early trials employing rather small numbers of subjects with established coronary artery disease (CAD) demonstrated that lipid reduction was often but not always associated with a lowered incidence of clinical end-points, including death and non-fatal myocardial infarction. However, significant angiographic benefit was rarely demonstrated in these investigations. More recent trials based on statins have shown a reduction in clinical events not only in patients with CAD, but also in healthy subjects given these drugs for primary prevention. Differences in design, duration, the role of confounders such as risk factors other than lipids, and the frequently poor correlation between angiographic changes and clinical outcomes are discussed.",

    "28": "The Ewing's sarcoma cell line RD-ES, which carries the EWS/FLI-1 fusion gene, responded to the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin with growth arrest. Replenishment of mevalonate (MVA) to the arrested cells restored cell growth. However, if tunicamycin (TM), which is an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, was present together with MVA the cells remained arrested, indicating that N-linked glycosylation is of importance for growth of Ewing's sarcoma cells. Inhibition of the biosynthesis of EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein by treatment with antisense oligonucleotides also led to growth arrest, suggesting that this protein is of importance for cell growth. We investigated whether MVA synthesis and N-linked glycosylation could be involved in regulation of the expression of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein, which in fact contains four potential sites for N-linked glycosylation. We found that inhibition of both HMG-CoA reductase and N-linked glycosylation drastically decreased the expression of the fusion protein, which mainly appears in the cell nuclei. There was no significant difference in the inhibitory effect on the fusion protein between the cytoplasm and the cell nuclei, indicating that the transport of the fusion protein to the cell nucleus is not affected. The fusion protein did not exhibit any gel electrophoretic mobility shift after treatment of the cells with lovastatin or TM, and it did not incorporate [3H]glucosamine. Therefore we can conclude that the fusion protein is not a glycoprotein. The decreased expression of the fusion protein following lovastatin or TM treatment was found to be due to a lowered stability of de novo-synthesized fusion protein. The down-regulation of the fusion protein was correlated to growth arrest. Furthermore, the kinetics between the expression of EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein and the initiation of DNA synthesis in MVA-stimulated cells were similar. Taken together, our data suggest that the regulatory role of N-linked glycosylation in the expression of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein is important for growth of Ewing's sarcoma cells. Possible mechanisms underlying TM-induced decrease in EWS/FLI-1 expression may involve the breaking of growth factor receptor pathways.",

    "35": "Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates were shown to cause macrophage apoptosis by inhibiting enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway leading from mevalonate to cholesterol. This study suggests that, in osteoclasts, geranylgeranyl diphosphate, the substrate for prenylation of most GTP binding proteins, is likely to be the crucial intermediate affected by these bisphosphonates. We report that murine osteoclast formation in culture is inhibited by both lovastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase, and alendronate. Lovastatin effects are blocked fully by mevalonate and less effectively by geranylgeraniol whereas alendronate effects are blocked partially by mevalonate and more effectively by geranylgeraniol. Alendronate inhibition of bone resorption in mouse calvaria also is blocked by mevalonate whereas clodronate inhibition is not. Furthermore, rabbit osteoclast formation and activity also are inhibited by lovastatin and alendronate. The lovastatin effects are prevented by mevalonate or geranylgeraniol, and alendronate effects are prevented by geranylgeraniol. Farnesol and squalene are without effect. Signaling studies show that lovastatin and alendronate activate in purified osteoclasts a 34-kDa kinase. Lovastatin-mediated activation is blocked by mevalonate and geranylgeraniol whereas alendronate activation is blocked by geranylgeraniol. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that alendronate, acting directly on osteoclasts, inhibits a rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, essential for osteoclast function. This inhibition is prevented by exogenous geranylgeraniol, probably required for prenylation of GTP binding proteins that control cytoskeletal reorganization, vesicular fusion, and apoptosis, processes involved in osteoclast activation and survival.", 
    "36": "Data regarding the effects of plasma lipid lowering on the evolution of thoracic aortic atherosclerosis (TAA) are scarce. In this study, we performed transesophageal echocardiography to characterize TAA in 16 newly diagnosed patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and to follow its evolution after 2 years of statin treatment. TAA was graded as follows: grade I = normal intima; grade II = increased intimal echo density without thickening; grade IIIA = increased intimal echo density with single atheromatous plaque < or = 3 mm; grade IIIB = multiple plaques < or = 3mm; grade IV = > or = 1 plaque >3 mm; and grade V = mobile or ulcerated plaques. Baseline aortic intimal morphology was grade I in one patient, grade II in 4, grade IIIA in 6, grade IIIB in 3, and grade IV in 2 patients. Hypolipidemic treatment resulted in significant reductions in plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Follow-up aortic morphology was grade I in 5 patients, grade II in 2, grade IIIA in 3, grade IIIB in 3, and grade IV in 3 patients. TAA remained stable in 7 patients, progressed in 3, and regressed in 6 patients. TAA evolved in a uniform manner in the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta. Patients with TAA regression were younger (39+/-14 vs 52+/-8 years, p=0.038) and had a greater decrease in plasma LDL cholesterol as a result of treatment (138+/-56 vs 73+/-55 mg/dl, p=0.036) than patients with TAA stability or progression. These observations support the hypothesis that hypolipidemic treatment may favorably affect the course of TAA in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "37": "Diseases associated with pathological fibroproliferation represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the importance of this class of disorders, current therapy is of limited value, and no therapy is available to reduce the fibroblast population size within existing fibrotic lesions. In this regard, constitutive expression of growth-promoting genes can sensitize cells to undergo apoptosis. Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that lovastatin potently induces apoptosis in fibroblasts constitutively expressing Myc, and that lung fibroblasts isolated from fibrotic lesions constitutively express growth-promoting genes. In this study, we sought to determine if nontransformed lung fibroblasts would manifest susceptibility to lovastatin-induced apoptosis similar to that observed in fibroblasts ectopically expressing Myc. Here we show that clinically achievable concentrations of lovastatin induce apoptosis in normal and fibrotic lung fibroblasts in vitro, as evidenced by acridine orange staining, terminal transferase nick end translation (TUNEL), and DNA laddering. Apoptosis of human lung fibroblasts was dose- and time-dependent, and blocked by exogenous mevalonic acid. Furthermore, apoptosis was associated with decreased levels of mature Ras, a molecule directly implicated in fibroblast rescue from apoptosis. The ability of lovastatin to induce fibroblast apoptosis in vivo was examined using a guinea pig wound chamber model. Lovastatin (5 microM, 8 d) reduced granulation tissue formation in the wound chambers by 64.7%, with associated ultrastructural evidence of fibroblast apoptosis. These findings support further study of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors as potential therapy for patients with fibroproliferative disorders.", 
    "38": "The activity of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) is tightly regulated, in part through post-transcriptional mechanisms that are mediated by nonsterol products of mevalonate metabolism. Previous reports have suggested that these mediators are derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Recent studies have implicated FPP hydrolysis products (e.g., farnesol), the squalene synthetase (SQS) reaction products presqualene pyrophosphate (PSQPP) and squalene, or their metabolites. To distinguish among these possible mediators, we evaluated the ability of HMGR and SQS inhibitors to induce compensatory increases in HMGR activity in cultured IM-9 cells. Mevinolin (HMGR inhibitor) produced predicted increases in HMGR activity that were related to the degree of cholesterolgenesis inhibition (e.g., 4-fold, 9-fold, and 17-fold increases relative to 50%, 76%, and 90% inhibition, respectively). By contrast, a variety of structurally distinct reversible, competitive, first half-reaction SQS inhibitors all reduced cholesterolgenesis by up to 90% with no appreciable increases in HMGR activity. These observations strongly suggest that nonsterol-mediated post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating HMGR activity remain intact after SQS first half-reaction inhibition, indicating that nonsterol regulator production is independent of SQS action and ruling out PSQPP, squalene and their metabolites as possible mediators. Unexpectedly, the SQS mechanism-based irreversible inactivator, zaragozic acid A (ZGA) exhibited the greatest degree of HMGR modulation, producing 5-fold, 11-fold, and 40-fold increases in HMGR activity at concentrations that produced 25%, 50%, and 75% cholesterolgenesis inhibition, respectively. The markedly greater magnitude of HMGR stimulation by ZGA versus mevinolin at similar levels of cholesterolgenesis inhibition suggests that ZGA may directly interfere with the production or action of the nonsterol regulator.",

    "40": "We conducted a retrospective study of 149 patients (61 percent men and 39 percent women; age range, 32 to 75 years) with no history of coronary artery disease who were referred by their primary care physicians for screening electron-beam CT. All patients underwent base-line scanning and follow-up assessment after a minimum of 12 months (range, 12 to 15), and a volumetric calcium score was calculated as an estimate of the total burden of plaque. Treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors was begun at the discretion of the referring physician. Serial measurements of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were obtained, and the change in the calcium-volume score was correlated with average LDL cholesterol levels.", 
    "41": "One hundred five patients (70 percent) received treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and 44 patients (30 percent) did not. At follow-up, a net reduction in the calcium-volume score was observed only in the 65 treated patients whose final LDL cholesterol levels were less than 120 mg per deciliter (3.10 mmol per liter) (mean [+/-SD] change in the score, -7+/-23 percent; P=0.01). Untreated patients had an average LDL cholesterol level of at least 120 mg per deciliter and at the time of follow-up had a significant net increase in mean calcium-volume score (mean change, +52+/-36 percent; P<0.001). The 40 treated patients who had average LDL cholesterol levels of at least 120 mg per deciliter had a measurable increase in mean calcium-volume score (25+/-22 percent, P<0.001), although it was smaller than the increase in the untreated patients.", 
    "42": "The extent to which the volume of atherosclerotic plaque decreased, stabilized, or increased was directly related to treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and the resulting serum LDL cholesterol levels. These changes can be determined noninvasively by electron-beam CT and quantified with use of a calcium-volume score.", 
    "43": "Pharmacological characterization of NTE-122 (trans-1,4-bis[[1-cyclohexyl-3-(4-dimethylamino phenyl)ureido]methyl]cyclohexane), a novel acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor, was performed with both in vitro and in vivo assay systems. NTE-122 inhibited microsomal ACAT activities of various tissues (liver of rabbit and rat, small intestine of rabbit and rat, and aorta of rabbit) and cultured cells (HepG2 and CaCo-2), with IC50 values from 1.2 to 9.6 nM. The inhibition mode of NTE-122 was competitive for HepG2 ACAT. NTE-122 had no effect on other lipid metabolizing enzymes, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, acyl-CoA synthetase, cholesterol esterase, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase, acyl-CoA:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase up to 10 microM. When NTE-122 was administered to the cholesterol diet-fed rats, serum and liver cholesterol levels were markedly reduced with an ED50 of 0.12 and 0.44 mg/kg/day, respectively. In the cholesterol diet-fed rabbits, NTE-122 significantly lowered plasma and liver cholesterol levels at more than 2 mg/kg/day. These results indicate that NTE-122 is a potent, selective and competitive inhibitor of ACAT, making it a worth while therapeutic agent for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.", 
    "44": "Most probably the decennia of the 1990s will be called the 'statin decennia' in the history of coronary heart disease prevention. Statins are effective, both in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, in middle-aged and older (< 76 years) men and women, in both diabetics and non-diabetics with coronary heart disease. Statins used in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease significantly reduce the risk of stroke. They also reduce daily attacks of myocardial ischemia. Pathogenetic pathways leading to 'biological plausibilities' of the statins favourable effects are multiple, which explains their rapid (less than 1 year) influence on coronary events. Until the results from new event trials become available, fibrates have very few indications as first line drug therapy in dyslipidemia. They should be considered in combined therapy with statins. The scientific evidence with statins is overwhelming and the question is no longer 'who should we treat?' but 'who can society afford to treat?'. Health economics are indeed pivotal in the use of statins and public health authorities have to find answers according to their resources or innovative strategies, including new aspects in dietary advice (the 'Mediterranean diet'?).", 
    "45": "Epithelial ovarian cancer is a major cause of cancer-related mortality in women, making the search for new treatment modalities essential. Sodium phenylacetate (NaPa), a phenylalanine derivative, has been shown to induce cytostasis and differentiation by inhibiting protein isoprenylation. Similar effects have been observed with phenylbutyrate, a phenylacetate congener. We examined in parallel the growth inhibitory activity against human ovarian carcinoma cell lines of phenylacetate, phenylbutyric acid (PB), and certain related compounds, and comparisons were made with lovastatin. On a molar basis, hydroxykynurenine and kynurenine showed the highest activity followed by PB and NaPa. Ovarian carcinoma cell lines were also sensitive to lovastatin in micromolar concentrations. Additive effects were observed when PB was combined with cisplatin or when NaPa or PB were combined with lovastatin. NaPa and PB, but not kynurenine, inhibited incorporation of [3H]mevalonate into ovarian carcinoma cells. An immune modulatory role might also be suggested for PB because it resulted in increased ovarian tumor cell expression of human leukocyte antigen class I and the cluster of differentiation molecule CD58, whereas transforming growth factor-beta2 expression was decreased. Phenylbutyrate, which is the ester form of PB, has shown acceptable pharmacological properties and clinical responses in patients with other malignancies, and might be considered for evaluation in ovarian cancer.", 
    "46": "In rat thoracic aorta, contractile responses to arginine vasopressin are two-fold higher in females than in males. To determine the roles of extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ in this sexual dimorphism in vascular function, vascular reactivity and Ca2+ channel function were examined in thoracic aortae of male and female rats. In the presence of diltiazem (10 microM), maximal contraction to vasopressin was reduced to a greater extent in male (65+/-2%) than in female aortae (38+/-1%). Maximal contractile responses to KCl and Bay K 8644 were similar in male and female aortae. Sensitivity to KCI was slightly but significantly higher in male than in female aorta; in contrast, sensitivity to Bay K 8644 was nearly three-fold higher in males than in females. Removal of the endothelium enhanced sensitivity to KCl similarly in male and female aortae. In the presence of simvastatin (60 microM; an inhibitor of intracellular Ca2+ release), reactivity to vasopressin was reduced substantially in female (42+/-1%) but unaltered in male aortae. Removal of the endothelium enhanced the inhibitory effect of simvastatin in both female (73+/-2%) and male aortae (41+/-2%). These findings demonstrate that male aortae depend more upon extracellular Ca2+ influx, whereas female aortae depend more upon intracellular Ca2+ release for vasopressin-induced contraction.", 
    "47": "The CARE study showed that the myocardial infarction recurrence rate in patients with moderate cholesterol blood level decreases early during pravastatin treatment. Our goal is to evaluate the possible role of pravastatin in preventing the myocardial lesions induced by cold stress. Twenty Wistar-EPM rats were divided into four groups: Control (CON); PR (Pravastatin) treated with 10 mg/kg/d for 15 days; S (Stress group) in which the rats were submitted to cold stress (-8 degrees C for four hours); and PR + S group treated with pravastatin like PR group and also submitted to the cold stress. The animals were sacrificed and heart fragments were removed for optic and electronic microscopic analysis. The variable considered was mitochondria abnormality (edema, lyses and vacuolization) that was interpreted as crystolyses indices (CI) (n degree of abnormal mitochondria/n degree total of mitochondria). The following crystolyses indices, were found for each group respectively: CON, 2.0%; S, 95.5%; PR, 19.9% and PR + S group, 27.7%*(*p < 0.01). In conclusion, pravastatin prevented myocardial lesions induced by cold stress significantly.", 
    "48": "After defining the type of hyperlipoproteinaemia (the three main are IIa, IIb and IV), confirming its primary nature (i.e. after eliminating the various causes of secondary hyperlipoproteinaemia) and after defining the therapeutic objective (different according to the context of primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention), treatment must be prescribed. It always consists of diet, and very often a lipid-lowering drug. The remarkable results obtained with statins in studies of primary prevention, secondary prevention and regression of atherosclerosis does not mean that they can be prescribed blindly. Therapeutic indications depend on the type of hyperlipidaemia. By limiting the discussion to the three main types of atherogenic hyperlipoproteinaemia, treatment consists of: in pure type IIa hypercholesterolaemia: a first-line statin (or fibrate or resin in the case of adverse effects); in pure type IV hypertriglyceridaemia: a fibrate and possibly omega-3 fatty acids; in combined or mixed type IIb hyperlipidaemia: a statin in the case of type IIb with predominant hypercholesterolaemia, a fibrate in the case of type IIb with predominant hypertriglyce-ridaemia, failure to comply with these rules can lead to poor laboratory results.", 
    "49": "The relationship between plasma lipid abnormalities and the risk for cardiovascular disease is now clearly established. In addition to quantitative abnormalities such as increased plasma LDL-cholesterol and decreased HDL-cholesterol levels, lipid qualitative abnormalities are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Indeed, dense triglyceride-rich LDL particles are atherogenic. Moreover, oxidized LDL are associated with increased cardiovascular risk and may play a central role in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic plaque. Fasting triglyceride level has rarely been shown to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, in the general population, but plasma triglyceride levels, following an oral fat load, seem to be a better marker. Recent intervention studies have shown an early effect of HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, suggesting possible additive actions of statins on the atherosclerotic plaque, on the endothelial function and on thrombosis. The Care study shows that a clinical benefit with pravastatin treatment, in secondary prevention, can be obtained in patients with LDL-cholesterol above 125 mg/dl. If all the primary and secondary intervention studies have shown reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with hypolipidemic drugs, we also have to keep in mind the positive results from the dietary intervention studies, showing beneficial actions of diets rich in vitamins, fibers and omega 3 fatty acids. In clinical practice, compliance of the patient to his treatment is often difficult to achieve and many studies have shown that control of hyperlipidemia is frequently inaccurate and needs to be reinforced. A comprehensive education of the hyperlipidemic patient is urgently needed in order to improve his knowledge about hypolipidemic diet and to obtain his motivation which is essential for a long term compliance.", 
    "50": "Morbidity, mortality and the incidence of myocardial revascularisation procedures can be reduced by simvastatin, an inhibitor of the HMG-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34). It was hypothesised that inhibition of isoprenylation of signalling proteins by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (vastatins), especially of the p21ras proteins could be causative for suppression of vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. The primary pharmacological mechanism of vastatins on human vascular SMC still remains unexplained. To analyse the influence of vastatins, SMC grown in presence of endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS) were exposed to different concentrations of lovastatin. At 10 microM concentration, inhibition of SMC proliferation was associated with induction of apoptosis in a large fraction of cells as at the 1 microM level apoptosis was induced only in a minority of SMC. Protein phosphorylation on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues demonstrated no differences to untreated controls. Lovastatin induced arrest of cells in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and DNA synthesis was reduced. Western blot analysis demonstrated a significant induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 protein expression. This led to strong inhibition of cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) resulting in a cell cycle arrest. Our study provides evidence for a pharmacological explanation for the inhibition of ECGS-driven proliferation of human SMC by lovastatin.", 
    "51": "Subjects with hypercholesterolaemia (HC) have increased fasting cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity and accelerated cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) from HDL to apo B-containing lipoproteins. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of postprandial lipaemia and pravastatin treatment on plasma triglycerides (TG) and CETP activity and on CET and LDL Stokes' diameter in primary HC (n = 19, total cholesterol > or =6.5, LDL-cholesterol > or =4.5, TG <4.0 mmol/l). Samples were collected fasting and 6 h after an oral fat load (0.88 g/kg body weight) after 6 weeks therapy with placebo or pravastatin 40 mg nocte according to a double-blind randomized cross-over study. Apart from significant reductions in plasma total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol apo B and TG. pravastatin significantly reduced CETP activity in both the fasting (mean +/- SD, 37.9+/-12.2 to 32.0+/-10.3 nmol/ml plasma per h) and postprandial state (35.5+/-11.3 to 31.3+/-9.5 nmol/ml plasma per h) compared to equivalent placebo phases. CETP activity did not change during postprandial lipaemia despite a significant 45-55% increase in CET to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) of d <1.006 g/ml. LDL Stokes' diameter was unchanged postprandially or by pravastatin. The mass of TRL was the strongest contributor to variation in CET in both fasting and postprandial plasma, accounting for at least 77% of the variance of CET. Postprandial TRL-TG was the strongest contributor to variation in fasting LDL Stokes' diameter in untreated HC (54%) whilst HDL-cholesterol was the strongest fasting contributor to variation (45%) for placebo- and pravastatin-treated HC. We conclude that pravastatin may reduce the atherogenicity of the lipoprotein profile in HC by reducing CETP activity. Furthermore, CET is strongly influenced by postprandial lipaemia which may have a cumulative effect on LDL size.", 
    "52": "Cross-linking the high affinity IgE receptor Fc epsilonRI of basophils and mast cells activates receptor-associated protein-tyrosine kinases and stimulates a signaling cascade leading to secretion, ruffling, spreading, and cytokine production. Previous evidence that the pan-prenylation inhibitor lovastatin blocks Ag-stimulated Ca2+ influx, secretion, and membrane/cytoskeletal responses implicated isoprenylated proteins in the Fc epsilonRI-coupled signaling cascade but could not distinguish between contributions of C15 (farnesylated) and C20 (geranylgeranylated) species. Here we establish concentrations of lovastatin and the farnesyl-specific inhibitor BZA-5B that inhibit the farnesylation and Ag-induced activation of Ras species in RBL-2H3 cells (H-Ras, K-RasA, and K-RasB). These inhibitors have little effect on tyrosine kinase activation, which initiates Fc epsilonRI signaling. Although Ras is disabled, only lovastatin substantially blocks Raf-1 activation, and neither inhibitor affects mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase kinase (MEK) or ERK1/ERK2 activation. Thus, the pathway to Fc epsilonRI-mediated MEK/ERK and ERK activation can apparently bypass Ras and Raf-1. Predictably, only lovastatin inhibits Ag-induced ruffling, spreading, and secretion, previously linked to geranylgeranylated Rho and Rab family members. Additionally, only lovastatin inhibits phospholipase Cgamma-mediated inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate production, sustained Ca2+ influx, and Ca2+-dependent IL-4 production, suggesting novel roles for geranylgeranylated (lovastatin-sensitive, BZA-5B-insensitive) proteins in Fc epsilonRI signal propagation. Remarkably, BZA-5B concentrations too low to inactivate Ras reduce the lag time to Ag-induced Ca2+ stores release and enhance secretion. These results link a non-Ras farnesylated protein(s) to the negative regulation of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and secretion. We identified no clear role for Ras in Fc epsilonRI-coupled signaling but suggest its involvement in mast cell growth regulation based on the inhibition of cell proliferation by both BZA-5B and lovastatin.", 
    "53": "Conflicting results have been published during the past few years regarding the physiologic modes of action of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, generally referred to as statins, using standard doses. Three mechanisms have been described: increased LDL catabolic rate, increased removal of LDL precursors resulting in decreased LDL production and decreased VLDL production. The physiologic effects of statins seem to depend on the underlying pathology of the disorders under therapy. More recent data using either the more potent atorvastatin or larger doses of previously available statins (e.g. simvastatin 80-160 mg/day), suggest that both the potency of the statins and the underlying pathopHysiology are important in determining the predominant physiologic responses of patients. To understand physiologic responses more completely, drug-dose-physiologic response curves of apo B kinetics in various groups of patients are needed. Simultaneous studies of apo B, triglycerides and cholesterol metabolism are also needed and are currently feasible.",

After an 8-week cholesterol-decreasing diet phase, patients were allocated to groups to receive fluvastatin 40 mg daily (n = 33) or placebo (n = 36) given for 12 weeks. All patients had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations > or = 4.1 mmol/l 1 week before they were allocated to a treatment at random.

Mean +/- SD percentage changes in lipid concentrations from randomisation to the end of 12 weeks were calculated (n = 63) by intent-to-treat analysis. Total cholesterol decreased by 21.64 +/- 8.7% in the fluvastatin group and by 2.91 +/- 7.25% in the placebo group (P < 0.01); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 4.98 +/- 10.84% in the fluvastatin group and decreased by 0.05 +/- 8.68% in the placebo group (P = 0.05); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 27.14 +/- 8.45% in the fluvastatin group and by 2.16 +/- 9.68% in the placebo group (P < 0.01); very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 30.70 +/- 30.65% in the fluvastatin group and by 9.80 +/- 28.6% in the placebo group (P < 0.01); triglyceride decreased by 18.13 +/- 17.35% in the fluvastatin group and by 2.97 +/- 21.85% in the placebo group (P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for any other biochemical or haematological parameters. Adverse events were mainly mild, diminishing with continued treatment, and no event was serious by standard criteria. Patient-assessed tolerability after randomised treatment was 'very good' for 18 fluvastatin patients and for 26 placebo patients (P = 0.79).

Decline in the activity of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain was observed in diaphragm and psoai major in rats aged 35 and 55 weeks, and that of complex IV in rats aged 55 weeks. Pravastatin accelerated significantly age-related decline in the activity of complex I of diaphragm mitochondria, though pravastatin did not show significant effect on normally observed age-associated decline in the activities of complex IV of psoai major and diaphragm mitochondria. Aging effect on mitochondrial respiratory function was not observed on heart muscle and liver in rats up to 55 weeks old, and pravastatin did not effect significantly heart and liver mitochondrial respiratory function. From these results, careful clinical examination on respiratory muscle function should be necessary in patients treated with pravastatin particularly in elderly patients.",

Recent studies of cholesterol-lowering drug therapy demonstrate significant reductions in risks of mortality and coronary events in patients with existing coronary artery disease. The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) demonstrated the therapy's effectiveness as primary prevention in patients without demonstrated coronary artery disease. Now that the efficacy of lipid reduction has been demonstrated conclusively, we face the difficult question of deciding what the treatment goals should be, whom to treat, and how to make those decisions cost effectively. These questions have complex social and ethical components and will lead to considerable discussion about how lipid-decreasing drugs will be used.", 
    "60": "Although hyperlipidemia is a known risk factor for coronary artery disease, lipid-lowering agents were not used widely until recently because evidence was lacking that they could prolong life. In 1987, a large clinical trial, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), was designed to test whether such therapy could decrease all-cause mortality in patients with documented coronary artery disease. The prospective, randomized, multicenter trial included 4,444 patients who had had angina pectoris or myocardial infarction (MI), serum total cholesterol of 213-310 mg/dL, and serum triglycerides < or =221 mg/dL. Patients received either simvastatin 20-40 mg/day or placebo and were followed for a median of 5.4 years. Therapy decreased total cholesterol an average of 25%; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 35%; and triglyceride levels, 10%. Therapy increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels 8%. Although noncardiac death rates were similar among the groups, the relative risk of mortality (from any cause) was decreased 30%, and the relative risk of coronary mortality was decreased 42% in the simvastatin arm. The mortality risk reductions were profound in patients > or =60 years of age. Treatment also significantly decreased the relative risk of coronary events and the need for bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty. Patients with diabetes also benefited significantly from simvastatin therapy. The reductions in relative risk of major coronary events were achieved irrespective of such baseline risk factors as hypertension and smoking and such medication factors as aspirin, beta-blocker, and calcium-antagonist use.

In both the aggressive- and moderate-treatment groups, clinicians titrated lovastatin dosages based on individual patients' LDL-cholesterol levels. Based on angiography performed 4-5 years after enrollment, the rate of disease progression was 31% lower in aggressive-treatment patients than in those who received moderate treatment.

Given the wide variation in the prices and efficacy of statins, formal cost-effectiveness analysis may improve drug selection decisions. To assess the cost-effectiveness of statin therapy in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, we developed a model of the costs and consequences of lipid-regulating therapy and estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of 5 statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin) at usual starting doses versus no therapy. Drug effects on serum lipids were assessed using data approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for product labeling. Annual risks of coronary event occurrence were estimated using Framingham Heart Study coronary risk equations developed for use in this model. Current estimates of direct medical costs of coronary heart disease were used to assign costs to health states and acute coronary events. Main outcome measurements were net cost (statin therapy minus savings in coronary heart disease treatment), gain in life expectancy, and cost per life-year saved. The maximum gain in life expectancy was achieved with atorvastatin, which also had a lower net cost than lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. Compared with fluvastatin, atorvastatin's greater effectiveness is attained at a lower cost per life-year saved. The cost-effectiveness of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease has been improved with the introduction of atorvastatin.", 
    "69": "Malignant gliomas are thought to be highly dependent on the mevalonate pathway for cell growth. Lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, inhibits not only the rate-limiting step in the mevalonate pathway (hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase), but also the prenylation of several key regulatory proteins including ras and the small guanosine triphosphate binding proteins. Therefore, from August 1994 through March 1996, 18 patients with either anaplastic glioma or glioblastoma multiforme were entered into a trial testing the safety of high-dose lovastatin with or without radiation. Although the response data is too premature to evaluate activity, the fact that high doses of lovastatin are well tolerated with concurrent radiation suggests that central nervous system toxicity will not be a significant limiting toxicity as more selective farnesyltransferase inhibitors are brought into the clinic as radiation sensitizers.", 
    "70": "Four patients with systemic autoimmune disorders, 3 of a serious nature, presented to 1 cardiologist over a 20-month span. In 3 of these cases, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor was presumably etiologic, while in the fourth case, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor might have unmasked the disorder. It would be useful to determine the true frequency of this complication, particularly in older patients not included in most of the statin trials to date. It is well established that autoimmune phenomena and particularly the development of autoantibodies increase with age. The data presented in this report that the group of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors could be a heretofore poorly recognized etiologic agent. This issue might be addressed by a case-control study looking at the prevalence of statin use in elderly patients with systemic autoimmune disorders and in controls. Until then, the authors advise caution in the use of this class of medications in patient subgroups for whom no clear-cut clinical benefit has yet been proven.", 
    "71": "The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is best known for catalysing a rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, but it also participates in the production of a wide variety of other compounds. Some clinical benefits attributed to inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase are now thought to be independent of any serum cholesterol-lowering effect. Here we describe a new cholesterol-independent role for HMG-CoA reductase, in regulating a developmental process: primordial germ cell migration. We show that in Drosophila this enzyme is highly expressed in the somatic gonad and that it is necessary for primordial germ cells to migrate to this tissue. Misexpression of HMG-CoA reductase is sufficient to attract primordial germ cells to tissues other than the gonadal mesoderm. We conclude that the regulated expression of HMG-CoA reductase has a critical developmental function in providing spatial information to guide migrating primordial germ cells.",

Oral administration of fluvastatin at low doses (3.13 and 6.25 mg/kg) inhibited the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in rat liver microsomes, but high doses (12.5 and 25 mg/kg) did not change the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Fluvastatin at any dose used had no effect on the content of cytochrome P-450 and the activity of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. In in vitro experiments, concentrations of fluvastatin ranging from 1 x 10(-6) - 1 x 10(-4) M markedly inhibited NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes, but pravastatin weakly inhibited lipid peroxidation. The order of magnitude of inhibition of each drug on in vitro lipid peroxidation was butylated hydroxytoluene > probucol > or = fluvastatin > pravastatin. Moreover, fluvastatin chemically scavenged active oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anion generated by the Fenton reaction and by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system, respectively, but pravastatin showed no scavenging of superoxide anion. These results indicate that the suppression of in vivo and in vitro lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes may be, at least in part, due to the scavenging by fluvastatin of free radicals.", 
    "77": "It has recently been suggested that bisphosphonates may have direct antitumor effects in vivo, in addition to their therapeutic antiresorptive properties. Bisphosphonates can inhibit proliferation and cause apoptosis in human myeloma cells in vitro. In macrophages, bisphosphonate-induced apoptosis was recently found to be a result of inhibition of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. The aim of this study was to determine whether bisphosphonates also affect human myeloma cells in vitro by inhibiting the MVA pathway. Incadronate and mevastatin (a known inhibitor of the MVA pathway) caused apoptosis in JJN-3 myeloma cells and inhibited cell proliferation. Geranylgeraniol and farnesol prevented incadronate-induced apoptosis and had a partial effect on cell cycle arrest. MVA and geranylgeraniol prevented mevastatin-induced apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation and completely prevented the effect of mevastatin on the cell cycle. These observations demonstrate that incadronate-induced apoptosis in human myeloma cells in vitro is the result of inhibition of the MVA pathway.", 
    "78": "We have previously shown in vivo that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor atorvastatin decreases hepatic apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion into plasma. To test the hypothesis that atorvastatin modulates exogenous triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) metabolism in vivo, an oral fat load (2 g fat/kg body wt) containing retinol (50 000 IU) was given to 6 control miniature pigs and to 6 animals after 28 days of treatment with atorvastatin 3 mg. kg-1. d-1. A multicompartmental model was developed by use of SAAM II and kinetic analysis performed on the plasma retinyl palmitate (RP) data. Peak TRL (d<1.006 g/mL; Sf>20) triglyceride concentrations were decreased 29% by atorvastatin, and the time to achieve this peak was delayed (5.2 versus 2.3 hours; P<0.01). The TRL triglyceride 0- to 12-hour area under the curve was decreased by 24%. In contrast, atorvastatin treatment had no effect on peak TRL RP concentrations, time to peak, or its rate of appearance into plasma; however, the TRL RP 0- to 12-hour area under the curve was decreased by 20%. Analysis of the RP kinetic parameters revealed that the TRL fractional clearance rate was increased significantly, 1.4-fold (3.093 versus 2.276 pools/h; P=0.012), with atorvastatin treatment. The percent conversion of TRL RP from the rapid-turnover to the slow-turnover compartment was decreased by 47% with atorvastatin treatment. The TRL RP fractional clearance rate was negatively correlated with very low density lipoprotein apoB production rate measured in the fasting state (r=-0.49). Thus, although atorvastatin had no effect on intestinal TRL assembly and secretion, plasma TRL clearance was significantly increased, an effect that may relate to a decreased competition for removal processes by hepatic very low density lipoprotein.", 
    "79": "Mesangial cell proliferation is a key feature of glomerulonephritis. The hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor lovastatin is known to inhibit cell cycle progression. To determine the inhibitory mechanisms of mesangial cell proliferation by lovastatin, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, and expression of CDK inhibitor (p27Kip1, p21Cip1, and p16INK4) mRNA and protein were measured. Lovastatin inhibited phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and mesangial cell proliferation dose dependently. Lovastatin increased the p27Kip1 protein level but produced no changes in the abundance of the p27Kip1 mRNA level both in the presence and absence of mitogens. Treatment with lovastatin revealed the increment of both CDK2- and CDK4-bound-p27Kip1. The experiment using antisense oligonucleotide against p27Kip1 showed significant amelioration of lovastatin-induced cell cycle arrest. Lovastatin reduced both platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated CDK2 and CDK4 kinase activities. In conclusion, lovastatin inhibited mesangial proliferation via translational upregulation or impairment of p27Kip1 protein degradation. Lovastatin serves as a potential therapeutic approach to mesangial proliferative disease.",

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly increased by lovastatin in type IIa and fenofibrate in type IIb. Fenofibrate decreased total triglyceride levels in both types of hyperlipidaemia significantly more effectively than lovastatin. The most important and commonly observed adverse effects in the fenofibrate group were dermatological events (three patients), myalgia (two patients) and asymptomatic increase in aminotransferase values (nine patients), while in the lovastatin group cardiovascular events (five patients) were the most common. All five patients had coronary heart disease at baseline. In general terms, both drugs were well tolerated.",

N2a cells transfected with the connexin 43 gene showed restored cell-to-cell dye transfer, which could then be improved nearly fourfold by addition of apigenin. To test the drugs in HSV thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) tumor killing, mixtures of 90% wild-type (WT) with 10% HSV-tk gene-modified MCA38 adenocarcinoma cells were exposed in vitro to GCV +/- apigenin or lovastatin. A significant bystander effect (BSE) was seen following GCV treatment alone, while neither apigenin or lovastatin alone had any effect on the recovery of viable tumor colonies. However, GCV-treated cultures also exposed to apigenin or lovastatin showed an increased BSE and reduced tumor cell recovery. Thirty percent of mice bearing tumors from the same mixture of 90% WT and 10% HSV-tk MCA38 cells treated with GCV alone became tumor free. Tumor-bearing mice given only two or three injections of lovastatin or apigenin during GCV treatment had a doubling of the antitumor response rate, with 60-70% of the mice achieving complete remission. These results support the hypothesis that the transfer of phosphorylated GCV from HSV-tk gene-expressing cells to neighboring WT tumor cells is a major component of the BSE and that pharmacological manipulation of GJ function with lovastatin or apigenin can result in striking improvement in the antitumor response in mice with tumors modified to contain as few as 10% HSV-tk cells.", 
    "117": "Our previous studies have shown that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (HCRI) causes rhabdomyolysis and electrical myotonia in rabbits and also kills L6 myoblasts in culture. In the present study, we analyzed the intracellular signal transduction pathway of HCRI-induced cell death using L6 myoblasts as a model system. Here, we report that simvastatin, a lipophilic HCRI, efficiently inhibited isoprenylation of Ras proteins and therefore induced translocation of a significant part of Ras proteins from the membrane fraction into the cytosolic fraction within 10 min. With this translocation, PI 3-kinase activity of the Ras-bound form both in total and in the membrane fraction was also decreased profoundly. Furthermore, various PI 3-kinase inhibitors also caused cell death with morphological changes similar to those caused by simvastatin. These results might represent the molecular events of HCRI-induced cell death, and suggest the significance of PI 3-kinase activity of the Ras-bound form in the maintenance of cell viability.",

    "121": "The dangers of elevated serum cholesterol levels--and in particular, of increased concentrations of small, dense lipoproteins--have been fully delineated. Although effective therapies are available, too many physicians fail to look for hypercholesterolemia, or fail to treat it effectively. Adhering to therapeutic guidelines and encouraging patient compliance can be lifesaving.", 
    "122": "The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, interactions, and formulary considerations of atorvastatin relative to other hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are discussed. Atorvastatin calcium, a synthetic stereoisomer of a pentasubstituted pyrrole, prevents the conversion of HMG-CoA by competitive and selective inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. This limits cholesterol formation. Atorvastatin undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism; the first-pass effect is saturable at higher doses. Time to maximum plasma concentration ranges from one to four hours. The plasma elimination half-life is considerably longer than for other statins. Like other statins, atorvastatin reduces low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, the reductions achieved with atorvastatin exceed those for other statins. Atorvastatin recipients are more likely to achieve LDL-C goals and to do so more quickly. Atorvastatin also moderately reduces triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and may play a role in the management of familial hypercholesterolemia. Adequate lipid control with atorvastatin monotherapy may preclude the need for combination drug therapy in some patients. The adverse effects of atorvastatin include mild gastrointestinal disturbances, increased liver enzyme levels, and myalgia. Drug interactions involving atorvastatin can be expected to parallel those of other statins metabolized via CYP3A4. Atorvastatin has become a popular addition to hospital formularies, even though formal pharmacoeconomic analyses are lacking. Atorvastatin effectively reduces blood lipids and may offer some advantages over other statins, but more studies are needed to clarify its optimal role in pharmacotherapy.", 
    "123": "The use of lipid-altering drugs has been shown to reduce the progression of atherosclerotic lesions and reduce the risk of atherosclerotic events (such as myocardial infarction and stroke). In general, these lipid-altering drugs are well tolerated but there is the potential for drug interactions. For example, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may interact with macrolides, azalides, azole antifungals and cyclosporin. Resins (such as cholestyramine and colestipol) may impair the absorption of many concurrent medications. Fibrates have potential drug interactions with warfarin, furosemide (frusemide), oral hypoglycaemics and probenecid. Nicotinic acid (niacin) may have potential drug interactions with high dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), uricosuric agents (such as sulfapyrazone) and alcohol (ethanol). Finally, probucol may have potential drug interactions with antidysrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines. In addition, lipid-altering drugs, used in combination, may have the potential for drug interactions, enhancing some of the risks of adverse effects, such as myositis and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, in order to use lipid-altering drugs in the most effective, and safest manner, it is important for the clinician to have an understanding of the mechanisms of potential drug interactions, which drug interactions may theoretically occur, and specifically, which spe cific drug interactions have already been described.", 
    "124": "Dyslipidemia is found in the majority of renal and cardiac transplant recipients. Although 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors significantly lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, such treatment has been associated with muscle toxicity, especially when used in combination with cyclosporine (CsA). We investigated the efficacy and muscle safety of fluvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, in CsA-treated transplant recipients.", 
    "125": "The efficacy was determined by measuring the lipid profile before and after 8 weeks of fluvastatin therapy. As parameter for possible muscle damage, the rise in serum levels of the muscle proteins creatine kinase and myoglobin was measured after an exercise provocation test (30 min on a bicycle ergometer at 60% of their maximal work load) before and during fluvastatin therapy. Nineteen CsA-treated renal and cardiac transplant recipients with hypercholesterolemia were selected.", 
    "126": "After 8 weeks of treatment with a dose of fluvastatin necessary to reduce LDL-C below 3.5 mmol/L (20 mg for 3 and 40 mg for 16 patients), total cholesterol was lowered by 20% and LDL-C by 30%, and HDL2-C was increased by 35% (all P<0.01). The rise in creatine kinase after exercise before and during fluvastatin therapy was, respectively, 40% and 51%, and the rise in myoglobin was 64% and 50%. These rises were not significantly different. Hence, there was no indication for subclinical muscle pathology by fluvastatin use. Fluvastatin was well tolerated, and no adverse effects on liver or kidney function were found.",

    "128": "Primary and secondary prevention trials in individuals with high plasma cholesterol levels have proven that cholesterol-lowering drug treatment significantly reduces the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality, and prolongs life. The degree of clinical benefit derived from such treatment appears to be proportional to the percentage reduction in plasma cholesterol. Regression and reduced progression of atherosclerosis may partially account for the clinical gains derived from lipid-lowering drug therapy; however, other direct mechanisms may be operative, including reduced atherogenicity of macrophages, improved vascular vasodilation, and reduced thrombogenesis. Specific treatment is determined on the basis of LDL cholesterol levels and overall global risk for CHD, that is, the presence of CHD and/or other CHD risk factors. Angiographic and clinical data support intensive lipid-lowering therapy in all hypercholesterolemic patients with CHD and those with high CHD risk, particularly those with ultrasonographic evidence (but no symptoms) or clinical signs of extracoronary atherosclerosis. Selection criteria for monotherapy include LDL-cholesterol lowering efficacy, CHD morbidity/mortality and overall survival benefits, no adverse effect on concomitant metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes), tolerability, long-term safety, simple dose schedule, and cost effectiveness. However, in refractory hypercholesterolemia combination therapy may be required. Secondary prevention and primary prevention in individuals at high CHD risk are cost effective.", 
    "129": "Many advances in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes have been realized over recent years. In ST elevation myocardial infarction, new aggressive thrombolytic regimens improve early reperfusion and improve survival. The current focus is on bolus thrombolysis, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition, and low-molecular-weight heparin as adjuncts. In unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, two major advances are IIb/IIIa inhibition and low-molecular-weight heparin, each of which significantly improves the outcome of patients and which have just been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. Following acute coronary syndromes, cholesterol lowering with statin drugs has a major effect, even in the large group of patients with average cholesterol levels. Use of clopidogrel, a more potent antiplatelet agent than aspirin, appears to decrease recurrent ischemic events, which has highlighted the potential benefits of oral IIb/IIIa inhibitors, which are much more potent antiplatelet agents. An additional focus has been on ensuring that patients actually receive the currently available medications. With a great number of new medical treatments, the outcome of patients with acute coronary syndromes has improved and will continue to improve as we enter the next millennium.", 
    "130": "Patients with hypercholesterolaemia are at an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Lowering elevated cholesterol levels has been shown to reduce effectively the risk of coronary events. Atorvastatin, a recently introduced statin, produces pronounced lipid-lowering via inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. For example, atorvastatin 10-80 mg.day-1 reduces low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline by 41-61% in a dose-dependent manner. Atorvastatin also lowers triglyceride levels by 23-45% over the same dose range. While sharing a common mechanism of action with other statins, atorvastatin leads to greater decreases in LDL-C, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels than other statins. In the CURVES study, atorvastatin 10-40 mg.day-1 produced greater reductions in LDL-C than milligram equivalent doses of comparator statins. Studies have also shown that relatively more patients treated with atorvastatin achieve LDL-C treatment goals, and at a lower overall cost, than those treated with other statins. A further advantage of this enhanced efficacy is that atorvastatin shares a safety profile similar to that of the other statins. The efficacy and safety of atorvastatin has been demonstrated in a range of patient subgroups. A comprehensive ongoing clinical programme for atorvastatin includes morbidity and mortality studies.", 
    "131": "The increased incidence and prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) in recent years has produced a great economic burden on total health care expenditure in many countries. This includes the increased cost of prevention as well as the enormous cost of treatment of CHD and related events. The clinical usefulness and benefits of statins in primary and secondary prevention of CHD has been well established. However, an important issue is whether health care decision-makers will pay for these medicines. Pharmaco-economic analyses of statins have become extremely important in substantiating the true economic value of these lipid-lowering therapies. Recently published, large-scale outcome studies demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with statins, and the data from these trials have been used to conduct pharmaco-economic appraisals. Statin treatment was shown to be cost-effective in comparison with other health care interventions, and cost-effectiveness was related to the efficacy of the drug and the risk of cardiovascular disease at baseline. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of statins was improved by about 40% if high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were taken into account. It has been suggested that the cost-effectiveness of statins has been underestimated, since early large-outcome trials did not use stroke as a primary endpoint. When the costs of managing stroke were taken into consideration in recent meta-analyses, the cost-effectiveness of statins was significantly greater than had been previously thought.", 
    "132": "The Prospective Cardiovascular M\u00fcnster (PROCAM) study involved 4849 middle-aged men who were followed up for 8 years to record the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) events according to the risk factors present at study entry. The study showed that fasting levels of triglycerides were an independent risk factor for CHD events, irrespective of serum levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Other independent predictors of CHD included serum levels of LDL-C and HDL-C, age, systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, a family history of myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, but did not include total serum cholesterol levels. Individuals with an LDL-C/HDL-C ratio > 5 had a 19.2% chance of experiencing a CHD event in the next 8 years. Furthermore, if an LDL-C/HDL-C ratio > 5 was combined with hypertriglyceridaemia (> or = 2.3 mmol. l-1), the risk of CHD increased to 26.9%. The association between hypertriglyceridaemia and CHD events may be related to the presence of atherogenic, triglyceride-rich particles in plasma, such as LDL and very low density lipoproteins. High triglyceride levels may also predispose to thrombosis. Individuals with potentially atherogenic lipid profiles should be managed initially through the introduction of lifestyle changes. However, if these fail to achieve recommended target values, lipid-lowering therapy should be considered.",

    "134": "The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) lasted 5.4 years and showed that death rates in 4444 patients with coronary heart disease were 30% lower in those treated with simvastatin to lower serum cholesterol than in those given placebo. Apart from this main result, the 4S provided detailed information on rates of death and other manifestations of coronary heart disease, as well as on use of non-lipid forms of therapy. There were substantial differences in 4S placebo group rates of mortality, coronary deaths and major coronary events between countries. Surgical and medical therapy varied importantly between countries.", 
    "135": "Major inter-country differences in rates of death and myocardial infarction in patients with coronary heart disease were likely to be due to a composite of differences in baseline characteristics including smoking. They occurred in a setting of very uneven exploitation of the potential for improving survival of patients with ischaemic heart disease.", 
    "136": "Previous investigations revealed that hypolipidaemic treatment of patients with IHD in the Czech Republic is inadequate. Patients after revascularization operations are discharged from cardiosurgical departments without suitable medication and moreover the values of the lipid spectrum are affected by the surgical intervention. The objective of the investigation was to evaluate the indication of hypolipidaemic treatment during hospitalization or later during check-up examinations by attending physicians. The authors evaluated retrospectively 100 patients after revascularization operations of the heart discharged without hypolipidaemic treatment and 40 patients treated with fluvastatin because of the lipid values before surgery. Using questionnaires it was revealed that in the group without pharmacological intervention in 36% patients the lipid levels were checked and hypolipidaemic treatment was started in 14% of the patients. In the patients with pharmacological treatment 100% adherence to treatment and improvement of the lipid spectrum was found similarly as in comparable trials. Fluvastatin treatment was well tolerated. In the authors view hypolipidaemic treatment after revascularization should be started before discharge from hospital with regard to preoperative results of the lipid spectrum.", 
    "137": "Based on the established relation between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and coronary artery disease (CAD), the treatment guidelines of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) focus on LDL cholesterol reduction for primary and secondary prevention of CAD events. Abundant clinical trial evidence supports the importance of LDL cholesterol-lowering in decreasing CAD risk, both in angiographic trials, which measure CAD progression, and in trials with morbidity and mortality endpoints. The LDL cholesterol targets in the guidelines remain important treatment goals, and ongoing trials should answer questions of whether further reduction in LDL cholesterol will provide much additional benefit. Even in trials of statin therapy, in which substantial reductions of LDL cholesterol have been obtained, statins decrease (by 23-37%) but do not entirely eliminate events, suggesting that lipid parameters besides LDL cholesterol, such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoprotein(a), and LDL particle size and susceptibility to oxidation, as well as other risk factors, influence CAD risk. Unfortunately, at present, the majority of high-risk patients are not receiving either diet or drug therapy. Systematic screening to identify high-risk patients and methodical follow-up to implement diet, lifestyle modification, and drug therapy to lower LDL cholesterol, as provided for in the NCEP guidelines, should lead to significant benefits in the prevention of CAD events.", 
    "138": "Experience to date suggests that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins can be used relatively safely and effectively to treat dyslipidaemia complicating renal disease. Recent studies suggest that in addition to lowering plasma lipid levels, these drugs modify other factors that contribute to vascular injury. Furthermore, statins could slow the progression of chronic renal failure and may augment the action of immunosuppressive therapy after renal transplantation. Such newly defined actions, some of which could be unrelated to lipid lowering, are likely to extend the applications of statins in nephrology.", 
    "139": "The aim of study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of one-year therapy with simvastatin in relative low doses (5-20 mg/d). The examination was performed in the group of 55 patients with significant hypercholesterolemia (Fredrickson's type II). During one-year treatment with simvastatin there were observed the mean decrease of total cholesterol (TC) by 26%, LDL-C by 37%, and LDL-C/HDL-C rate by 38%. The normalization of cholesterolemia (TC < 200 and LDL-C < 130 mg/dL) was observed in 53% of patients (group A-75%, and group B-39%). Effective doses of simvastatin varied from 5 to 20 mg/d. Lp(a) decreased statistically significantly only in the group of patients with extensively elevated Lp(a): from 121.1 +/- 46.2 mg/dL before the treatment to 95.3 +/- 31.3 mg/dL after them. Hepatotoxic effects were not observed and antipyrine kinetics did not change during one-year treatment with simvastatin.", 
    "140": "Large scale primary and secondary prevention trials in recent years have revealed that the effective lipid reducing therapy with statins can reduce mortality of coronary heart disease by up to 30%. For the first time it has become possible to reduce LDL-cholesterol pharmacologically by more than 50%, a reduction that was only achieved by LDL-apheresis so far. Cost-effectiveness is becoming an important issue since this varies widely between patients according to the coronary risk. Treating the patients with the highest coronary risk is most cost effective. Currently, there are six statins on the market. Reduction of LDL-cholesterol is mainly mediated by the induction of LDL-receptor activity in the liver. In addition, some statins at high doses also reduce LDL-cholesterol synthesis. Due to variations in the molecular structure of the active compounds these 6 statins have important pharmacological differences, such as their capacity to reduce plasma triglycerides, their interaction with other drugs. The daily recommended doses of the statins range from 0.1 mg (cerivastatin) to 80 mg (atorvastatin). In this review the differences in the pharmacological and clinical actions of the statins are analyzed.",

    "142": "To measure aortic compliance, coronary calcification and carotid intimal-medial thickness during reduction of cholesterol level in patients with and without coronary artery disease.", 
    "143": "We studied 64 hypercholesterolaemic patients, 24 with and 40 without coronary artery disease. All were administered fluvastatin for 1 year. Aortic compliance was assessed using magnetic resonance and coronary calcification score was determined by electron beam computed tomography. Carotid intimal-medial thickness in 34 patients was measured by carotid ultrasound means.", 
    "144": "There was a rise in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and falls in total cholesterol level, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, low: high-density lipoprotein ratio, triglyceride level and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Coronary artery disease patients had a higher coronary calcification score (442 +/- 551) than did other patients (269 +/- 724, P = 0.0002). For both groups there was a small rise in coronary calcification score during the study. Mean aortic compliance rose and blood pressure and carotid intimal-medial thickness fell. Analysis revealed significant correlations between change in mean aortic compliance and changes in high-density lipoprotein level (r = 0.3, P = 0.036), very-low-density lipoprotein level (r = -0.31, P = 0.038) and low: high-density lipoprotein ratio (r = -0.35, P = 0.014). There was no significant difference in these changes between the two patient groups.", 
    "145": "An improvement in aortic compliance over 1 year indicates that increase in high-density lipoprotein level, decrease in very-low-density lipoprotein level and improvement in low: high-density lipoprotein ratio caused by administration of fluvastatin beneficially influenced vascular pathophysiology in hypercholesterolaemic patients with and without coronary artery disease. In those patients studied with carotid ultrasound means, carotid intimal-medial thickness decreased from 1.09 to 0.87 mm (P = 0.004), corroborating these results.", 
    "146": "-Macrophages secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that may weaken the fibrous cap of atherosclerotic plaque, predisposing its fissuration. The 92-kDa gelatinase B (MMP-9) has been identified in abdominal aortic aneurysms and in atherosclerotic tissues. Fluvastatin, through the inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway, inhibits major processes of atherogenesis in experimental models (smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages). We studied the effect of fluvastatin on the activity of MMP-9 in mouse and human macrophages in culture. Conditioned media of cells treated for 24 hours with fluvastatin were analyzed by gelatin zymography. In mouse macrophages, fluvastatin (5 to 100 micromol/L) significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner MMP-9 activity from 20% to 40% versus control. The drug, at a concentration as low as 5 micromol/L, inhibited MMP-9 activity ( approximately 30%) in human monocyte-derived macrophages as well. Phorbol esters (TPA, 50 ng/mL) stimulated MMP-9 activity by 50%, and fluvastatin inhibited this enhanced activity up to 50% in both mouse and human macrophages. The above results on the secretion of MMP-9 were confirmed by Western blotting and ELISA. The inhibitory effect of fluvastatin was overcome by the simultaneous addition of exogenous mevalonate (100 micromol/L), a precursor of isoprenoids. Fluvastatin's effect was fully reversible, and the drug did not cause any cellular toxicity. The statin did not block directly the in vitro activation of the secreted protease. Similar data were obtained with simvastatin. Altogether, our data indicate an inhibition of MMP-9 secretion by the drug. This effect is mediated by the inhibition of synthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of numerous derivatives essential for several cellular functions.", 
    "147": "Previously, we reported that lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of the enzyme HMG CoA reductase also acts as an antimitogenic agent by arresting cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle resulting in cell cycle-independent alteration of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs). In the present study we have investigated the nature of the CKIs (p21 and p27) alterations resulting in G1 arrest in both normal and tumor breast cell lines by lovastatin. We show that even though lovastatin treatment causes G1 arrest in a wide variety of normal and tumor breast cells irrespective of their p53 or pRb status, the p21 and p27 protein levels are not increased in all cell lines treated suggesting that the increase in p21 and p27 protein expression per se is not necessary for lovastatin mediated G1 arrest. However, the binding of p21 and p27 to CDK2 increases significantly following treatment of cells with lovastatin leading to inhibition of CDK2 activity and a subsequent arrest of cells in G1. The increased CKI binding to CDK2 is achieved by the redistribution of both p21 and p27 from CDK4 to CDK2 complexes subsequent to decreases in CDK4 and cyclin D3 expression following lovastatin treatment. Lastly, we show that lovastatin treatment of 76N-E6 breast cell line with an altered p53 pathway also results in G1 arrest and similar redistribution of CKIs from CDK4 to CDK2 as observed in other breast cell lines examined. These observations suggest that lovastatin induced G1 arrest of breast cell lines is through a p53 independent pathway and is mediated by decreased CDK2 activity through redistribution of CKIs from CDK4 to CDK2.", 
    "148": "Cerivastatin, a novel, synthetic, and enantiomerically pure 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, has been administered, in clinical trials, to over 2700 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia, of whom over 1000 received treatment for periods of up to 1 year. A global, pooled analysis of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cerivastatin was performed on data obtained from all randomized, double-blind studies in which cerivastatin at doses of 0.025-0.4 mg/day were compared with either placebo or active comparators. All studies had a 10-week, diet-controlled run-in period, the last 6 weeks of which included administration of single-blind placebo. Efficacy analysis of the pooled data at 8 weeks post-randomization showed that in comparison with placebo, cerivastatin achieved significant dose-dependent reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), the primary efficacy parameter, of between 14.2 and 36.1%. Reductions in LDL-C were accompanied by significant reductions in total cholesterol and triglycerides, together with increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The magnitude of the reduction in plasma triglycerides was strongly related to baseline triglyceride levels. In patients with baseline plasma triglycerides of >250 mg/dl, treatment with 0.4 mg/day cerivastatin decreased these levels by 37%. Cerivastatin was well tolerated, with the type and incidence of clinical adverse effects comparable to that of placebo and comparator drugs. The incidence of biochemical adverse effects was also similar to that seen with either placebo or comparator drugs and was independent of the dose of cerivastatin. Less than 1% of patients treated with cerivastatin at doses of 0.025-0.4 mg/day experienced clinically significant increases in either hepatic transaminases (> 3 x the upper limit of normal) or creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (> 5 x the upper limit of normal). The good tolerability of cerivastatin was reflected in a low rate of premature withdrawal from treatment, below or comparable to that of placebo-treatment. The pooled efficacy and safety analyses have shown that at 1% of the doses of other statins, cerivastatin is a safe, well-tolerated, and highly effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for the treatment of type IIa and IIb hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "149": "Epidemiological studies have established that elevated concentrations of plasma cholesterol, particularly the low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is one of the major risk factors for the development of arteriosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. Treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (vastatins) has become the most successful drug treatment in lowering total plasma and LDL cholesterol concentrations in the last years. The vastatins already available for treatment are therapeutically used in a dose-range between 10 and 80 mg/day. The new enantiomerically pure pyridine derivative cerivastatin sodium has demonstrated its efficacy in significantly lower doses in the microgram-range, not only in preclinical but also in clinical studies with daily doses of only 0.1-0.3 mg. The differences in the therapeutic doses are reflected by the Ki- and IC50-values from enzyme inhibition tests in comparison with various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Cerivastatin sodium exhibits much higher enzyme affinity with factors between 70 and almost 200. The Ki-value for cerivastatin sodium was 1.3 x 10(-9) M in comparison to 150 x 10(-9) M for lovastatin. The extremely high enzyme affinity of cerivastatin sodium was also reflected in its high activity in vivo. In acute in vivo studies cerivastatin sodium inhibited the hepatic [14C]cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate in both rats and dogs by 50% after oral administration at doses of 0.002 mg/kg body weight (ED50-values). This dose was comparable to 0.3 mg/kg of lovastatin. In subchronic dog studies a dose of 0.03 mg/kg lowered the serum LDL cholesterol concentration by 35% which is comparable with doses of 8-10 mg lovastatin/kg. Interesting results were observed in cholestyramine-primed dogs when 0.1 mg cerivastatin sodium/kg p.o. markedly decreased the serum triglycerides up to 70%. Cerivastatin shows a favourable pharmacokinetic profile with high liver selectivity. Rat studies have shown almost complete absorption and rapid hepatic clearance. Cerivastatin was highly bound to plasma proteins of rats, dogs and humans (>98%). Cerivastatin metabolites were excreted mainly via feces. The metabolism of cerivastatin sodium in man follows two metabolic pathways, demethylation to metabolite M1 and stereospecific hydroxylation to M23. The three major metabolites M1, M23 and the hydroxylated and demethylated metabolite M24 are highly active inhibitors not only in vitro but also in vivo. The human specific metabolites M23 and M24 inhibited the HMG-CoA reductase isolated from rat liver with the same potency as the parent compound cerivastatin sodium (IC50: 1.0-1.2 x 10(-9) M). M1 was slightly less active. Corresponding pharmacological activity was observed in vivo. M23 and M24 inhibited [14C]cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate in rat liver with ED50)-values between 0.001 and 0.002 mg/kg body weight which is similar to cerivastatin sodium and M1 exhibited an ED50-value of <0.006 mg/kg The strong inhibitory activity of these metabolites, in addition to cerivastatin's high enzyme affinity may explain the extraordinary pharmacological activity of cerivastatin and its ultra-low dose in man and demonstrates cerivastatin to be the most active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor amongst all vastatins.", 
    "150": "There is no debate about whether patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD) should receive cholesterol-lowering drug therapy: the great majority should. certainly those whose serum cholesterol exceeds 5 mmol/l. In primary CHD prevention the indication for lipid-lowering drug therapy is largely determined by the absolute risk of CHD. There is considerable disagreement about the level of absolute risk at which such treatment should be commenced. The relative absence of side-effects of the statin drugs and their relatively high cost means that issues of cost-effectiveness are of more concern for state health services than the balance between benefits of therapy and adverse events. Thus, the degree of risk at which they are recommended appears to be largely determined by the type of healthcare system a nation has and the frequency of high risk individuals in that nation. In Britain, which has both state healthcare and numerous high risk patients, the cost of primary prevention with statins except at extreme risk is viewed as prohibitive, whereas the CHD risk at which lipid-lowering drugs are recommended is lower in the USA, where healthcare costs are borne more directly by the patient, and in European countries with lower rates of CHD. Whatever level of risk is recommended for the use of lipid-lowering drugs in primary CHD prevention, the clinician should be in a position to assess CHD risk in an individual with a reasonable degree of accuracy. When recommended algorithms and charts were compared with calculations of risk using the equations derived from the Framingham Study, on which they are based, they were shown to be inaccurate. High density lipoprotein cholesterol emerged as a particularly important risk factor, which when omitted led to underestimation of risk in women and people with multiple risk factors. It is concluded that guidelines should be evaluated in the type of patient for whom they are intended. It is important to redress the balance between the numerous publications on the interpretation of clinical trials and the virtual absence of rigorous assessments of methods for determining CHD risk in clinical practice."
