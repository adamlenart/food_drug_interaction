102,25455106 | nonivamide | We conclude that nonivamide treatment exerts analgesic action in chronic low back pain and causes the release of the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory neuropeptide somatostatin which may play pivotal role in the pain-relieving effect.
103,"8904818 | veranisatin c | Veranisatin A and the related compound, anisatin, were tested for the other pharmacological activities such as locomotor activity and analgesic effect."
104,"8904818 | veranisatin b | Veranisatin A and the related compound, anisatin, were tested for the other pharmacological activities such as locomotor activity and analgesic effect."
105,"26692456 | swertiajaponin | Polynomial regression analysis showed the association between the contents of swertiajaponin, swertisin, trans-aconitic, and chicoric acids with the antitumor necrosis factor- activity of the extracts and fractions."
106,8661934 | benzoyl-coa | This represents another case in which benzoyl-CoA is a central intermediate in anaerobic aromatic metabolism.
107,24022687 | 3-dehydroquinate | The correlation analysis of gene expression and active compound contents support the idea that hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase and phosphomevalonate kinase in the mevalonate pathway and 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase in shikimate biosynthesis are potentially closely related to the accumulation of paeoniflorin and benzoylpaeoniflorin.
108,"10418340 | ginkgetin | In this study, ginkgetin was evaluated for in vivo antiarthritic and analgesic activities."
109,"10418340 | ginkgetin | When analgesic activity was measured, ginkgetin showed a dose-dependent inhibition in an animal model of acetic acid-induced writhing."
110,10418340 | ginkgetin | All these results indicate that ginkgetin may be a potential antiarthritic agent having analgesic activity.
111,"11988854 | ginkgetin | Ginkgetin, a biflavone from Ginkgo biloba leaves, was previously reported to be a phospholipase A2 inhibitor and this compound showed the potent antiarthritic activity in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis as well as analgesic activity."
112,"16327145 | ginkgetin | Ginkgetin, a biflavone from Ginkgo biloba leaves, was previously reported to be a phospholipase A(2) inhibitor and this compound showed the potent antiarthritic activity in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis as well as analgesic activity."
113,"15368673 | albafuran a | Five new compounds, named guangsangons A (1), B (5), C (6), D (7), and E (8), along with four known compounds, albafuran C (2), kuwanon X (3), kuwanon P (4), and kuwanon Y (9) were isolated from Morus macroura Miq.. Their structures were determined by means of spectroscopic analyses and chemical methods."
