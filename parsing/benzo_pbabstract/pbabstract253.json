While current practice relies heavily on combinations, many bipolar patients can be successfully stabilized if the initial monotherapy is carefully selected according to the patient's clinical characteristics. The data show that (1) unequivocal responders to long-term monotherapies such as lithium, lamotrigine, or atypical neuroleptics each have a very different clinical profile, including clinical presentation and course, comorbidity, and, in particular, family history and (2) bipolar patients who respond very well to a long-term monotherapy have often completely failed on other monotherapies. Combinations appear indicated particularly in bipolar patients who are treatment-resistant to monotherapy, do not tolerate it well, or have not yet exhibited the clinical characteristics needed to choose an effective monotherapy.", 
    "1": "Management strategies for bipolar disorder often entail relatively long-term, complex medication regimens that combine primary mood stabilizers, antipsychotic agents, antidepressants, and other medications, such as benzodiazepines. New strategies for the management of bipolar disorder have recently been evaluated in controlled clinical trials, including using newer anticonvulsants, replacing conventional antipsychotics with atypical antipsychotics, and using novel combination treatments. This article provides an overview of current management strategies for patients with bipolar disorder and describes how these approaches can be incorporated into clinical practice.", 
    "2": "The use of a Q-q-Q(linear ion trap) instrument to obtain product ion spectra is described. The instrument is based on the ion path of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with Q3 operable as either a conventional RF/DC quadrupole mass filter or a linear ion trap mass spectrometer with axial ion ejection. This unique ion optical arrangement allows de-coupling of precursor ion isolation and fragmentation from the ion trap itself. The result is a high sensitivity tandem mass spectrometer with triple quadrupole fragmentation patterns and no inherent low mass cut-off. The use of the entrance RF-only section of the instrument as accumulation ion trap while the linear ion trap mass spectrometer is scanning enhances duty cycles and results in increased sensitivities by as much as a factor of 20. The instrument is also capable of all of the triple quadrupole scans including multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) as well as precursor and constant neutral loss scanning. The high product ion scanning sensitivity allows the recording of useful product ion spectra near the MRM limit of quantitation.", 
    "3": "This study evaluated costs associated with risperidone and olanzapine treatment for schizophrenia. Data were collected from the Department of Veterans Affairs computerized database nine months before and nine months after patients began continuous treatment with risperidone (N=23) or olanzapine (N=47). Both agents were associated with significant reductions in psychiatric hospitalization costs. Median increases in antipsychotic costs were significantly higher for patients treated with olanzapine ($1,892) than for those treated with risperidone ($733). Mean dosages were 3.5 mg per day for the risperidone group and 18 mg per day for the olanzapine group. Although both treatments were associated with similar reductions in costs of psychiatric inpatient and outpatient care, it was significantly less expensive to prescribe risperidone than olanzapine.", 
    "4": "Psychotropic medication expenditures for community-dwelling elderly persons in the United States were examined with the 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). According to the MEPS, an estimated $1.07 billion US dollars was spent on psychotropic agents, and 53 percent of that was paid out of pocket. Antidepressants represented 61 percent of psychotropic expenditures. High expenditures were found for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ($469 million US dollars, or 44 percent of psychotropic expenditures), benzodiazepines ($241 million US dollars, or 22 percent), and tricyclic antidepressants ($119 million US dollars, or 11 percent). Estimates for psychotropic expenditures in 2002 totaled $1.41 billion US dollars after adjustment for inflation. Although psychotropic prescription costs were substantial, increased generic medication use and Medicare prescription plans could reduce the financial burden on elderly persons.", 
    "5": "Transition state analogs pepstatin methylester (PME) and L685458 have been shown to inhibit gamma-secretase non-competitively (Tian, G., Sobotka-Briner, C., Zysk, J., Liu, X., Birr, C., Sylvester, M. A., Edwards, P. D., Scott, C. W., and Greenberg, B. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 31499-31505). This unusual kinetics suggests physical separation of the sites for substrate binding and catalysis with binding of the transition state analogs to the catalytic site and not to the substrate binding site. Methods of inhibitor cross-competition kinetics and competition ligand binding were utilized to address whether non-transition state small molecule inhibitors, which also display non-competitive inhibition of gamma-secretase, inhibit the enzyme by binding to the catalytic site as well. Inhibitor cross-competition kinetics indicated competitive binding between the transition state analogs PME and L685458 and between small molecules arylsulfonamides and benzodiazepines, but non-competitive binding between the transition state analogs and the small molecule inhibitors. These results were indicative of two inhibitor binding sites, one for transition state analogs and the other for non-transition state small molecule inhibitors. The presence of two inhibitor binding sites for two different classes of inhibitors was corroborated by results from competition ligand binding using [3H]L685458 as the radioligand. Although L685458 and PME displaced the radioligand at the same concentrations as for enzyme inhibition, arylsulfonamides and benzodiazepines did not displace the radioligand at their Ki values, a result consistent with the presence of two inhibitor binding sites. These findings provide useful insights into the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of gamma-secretase that may facilitate the design of novel gamma-secretase inhibitors.",

    "7": "To determine whether use of CNS active medications, including benzodiazepines, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and narcotics, increases fracture risk in elderly, community-dwelling women, we examined use of these 4 categories of medications in a cohort of 8127 older women and followed the participants prospectively for incident nonspine fractures, including hip fractures. Current use of CNS active medications was assessed by interview with verification of use from containers between 1992 and 1994 and between 1995 and 1996. Use was coded as a time-dependent variable. Incident nonspine fractures occurring after the initial medication assessment until May 31, 1999, were confirmed by radiographic reports.", 
    "8": "During an average follow-up of 4.8 years, 1256 women (15%) experienced at least one nonspine fracture, including 288 (4%) with first hip fractures. Compared with nonusers, women taking narcotics (multivariate hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.83) and those taking antidepressants (multivariate HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.99-1.58) had increases in the risks for any nonspine fractures. Women taking tricyclic antidepressants and those using selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) had similar fracture rates. There were no independent associations between benzodiazepine use or anticonvulsant use and risk for nonspine fracture. Women taking antidepressants compared with nonusers had a 1.7-fold increase in the risk for hip fracture (multivariate HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.05-2.57). We did not observe independent associations between use of any of the other 3 classes of CNS active medications and risk of hip fracture.", 
    "9": "Community-dwelling older women taking narcotics have an increased risk for any nonspine fracture, and those taking antidepressants have a greater risk for nonspine fractures, including hip fracture. Rates of fracture were similar in women taking tricyclic antidepressants and those using SSRIs. Benzodiazepine use and anticonvulsant use were not independently associated with an increased risk of nonspine fractures, including hip fracture.", 
    "10": "Upper gastrointestinal examinations were performed in 11 unsedated ferrets and 4 ferrets sedated with ketamine and diazepam. Each animal received a 8-13 mL/kg body weight dosage of barium liquid (30% weight:volume). Radiographs were made immediately and at 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, 120 and 150 min (mins) after the barium was administered. Gastric emptying began immediately. Mean total gastric emptying was longer in sedated ferrets (130 +/- 40 min versus 75 +/- 54 min); however, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.18). Small intestinal transit time was less than 2 h in all ferrets. The barium-filled small bowel was best visualized on the 20- and 40-min radiographs and did not exceed 5-7 mm in width. Flocculation of barium in the small intestine and adherence of barium to the stomach mucosa was seen in almost all animals. The longitudinal colonic mucosal folds in the colon were well visualized in the normal upper gastrointestinal study and aided in distinguishing small intestine from large intestine. The use of ketamine and diazepam sedation did not significantly affect the parameters evaluated in the upper gastrointestinal study series.", 
    "11": "The neural substrates of age-related hippocampal dysfunction in primates are poorly understood. This issue was addressed with combined intracellular biocytin filling and whole-cell patch clamp recordings of intrinsic membrane properties and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in dentate granule cells in in vitro slices prepared from behaviorally characterized young (<11 years old) and aged (>24 years old) rhesus monkeys. Six of nine aged monkeys were significantly impaired in performance on the hippocampally mediated delayed nonmatch to sample (DNMS) task at a 2-minute delay. Morphometric analyses showed that cells from aged monkeys had significantly reduced vertical dendritic extents and distal dendritic branching but increased proximal dendritic branching. Intrinsic membrane and action potential properties did not differ between cells from young and aged monkeys with the exception of a small but significant increase in input resistance with age. The frequency, amplitude, and rise time of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptor-mediated miniature IPSCs were not significantly different in cells from young vs. aged monkeys. However, the miniature IPSC decay time constant and the benzodiazepine potentiation of this decay time constant were both significantly increased in cells from aged monkeys. These differences in the properties of dentate granule cells correlated positively with age but not specifically with impairment on the DNMS 2-minute delay task. Nevertheless, these changes in dendritic morphology, input resistance, and inhibitory signaling properties may be part of a constellation of subtle functional changes contributing to age-associated cognitive impairment.", 
    "12": "The aim of this study is to describe the current state of knowledge about the physiology of kainate type glutamate receptors as modulators of GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus.", 
    "13": "The activation of kainate receptors (KR) located in the presynaptic terminal of the interneurons reduces GABAergic synaptic transmission at the interneuron principal cell synapse in the CA1 layer of the hippocampus. This diminished release of GABA involves a metabotropic effect, and an that activation of both a pertussis toxin sensitive G protein and protein kinase C is required. In these same interneurons there is also a population of KR with an ionotropic effect in the somatodendritic compartment, which depolarise them and give rise to a massive release of neurotransmitter when activated. It has very recently been shown that activating KR by submicromolar concentrations of agonist can bring about an increase in the release of GABA, an effect described principally in the interneuron interneuron synapses, although the mechanism by which the KR produce this effect is yet to be described.", 
    "14": "KR act in the hippocampus as modulators of GABA release; they increase or decrease it and hence play a part in maintaining the exquisite balance of neuronal excitability. In abnormal conditions they can also notably upset the balance of this excitability and give rise to firing patterns of an epileptic kind, among other disorders.", 
    "15": "Benzodiazepines are frequently used not only as a part of general anesthesia but also for the purpose of sedation during regional anesthesia. Effects of these drugs on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity have been studied, but are still controversial. It is not known whether benzodiazepines affect expression of proopiomelanocortin, precursor protein of adrenocorticotropic hormone and related peptides.", 
    "16": "AtT20PL cell line, a clone of AtT20/D16v mouse corticotroph tumor cells stably transfected with approximately 0.7 kilobases (kb) of the rat proopiomelanocortin 5' promoter-luciferase fusion gene, was used. In the presence or absence of diazepam or midazolam, cells were stimulated by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or forskolin. Proopiomelanocortin gene expression was estimated by measurement of luciferase activity. Furthermore, to study the mechanism of benzodiazepine effects, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) efflux was measured by enzyme immunoassay.", 
    "17": "Diazepam and midazolam dose-dependently increased the proopiomelanocortin gene expression induced by CRH or forskolin. The potentiating effect was not affected by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists flumazenil and PK11195, but was abolished by a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H89. Cyclic AMP efflux induced by CRH or forskolin was also enhanced by diazepam and midazolam. In the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, potentiation of proopiomelanocortin gene expression and enhancement of cyclic AMP efflux by benzodiazepines were not observed.", 
    "18": "Benzodiazepines potentiate the effect of CRH or forskolin on proopiomelanocortin gene expression. The potentiating effect is not mediated by the benzodiazepine receptors, but its mechanism probably involves inhibition of phosphodiesterase.", 
    "19": "Intravenous anesthetics used during perioperative periods affect the vascular signaling molecules and the vascular reactivity. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an angiogenesis factor produced in and secreted from aortic smooth muscle cells, is a specific mitogen for vascular endothelial cells. This study investigated the effects of various intravenous anesthetics on VEGF release, and the underlying mechanism, in a rat aortic smooth muscle cell line, A10 cells.", 
    "20": "Intravenous anesthetics (midazolam and propofol) were continuously administered to rats by infusion. Cultured A10 cells were stimulated by intravenous anesthetics (midazolam, propofol, and ketamine). VEGF was evaluated by immunoassay. The phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases was evaluated by Western blotting.", 
    "21": "Continuous infusion of midazolam, but not propofol, increased the VEGF concentration in rat plasma. In cultured cells, midazolam stimulated VEGF release, but propofol and ketamine did not. Midazolam induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), without affecting p38 MAP kinase. PD98059 and U0126, specific inhibitors of MAP kinase kinase, significantly reduced the midazolam-stimulated release of VEGF. SP600125, a specific inhibitor of SAPK/JNK, significantly reduced midazolam-stimulated VEGF release. Applied together, PD98059 and SP600125 produced an additive reduction in midazolam-stimulated VEGF release. Moreover, a bolus injection of PD98059 truly inhibited the midazolam-increased VEGF concentration in rat plasma in vivo.", 
    "22": "Midazolam, but not propofol or ketamine, stimulates VEGF release in aortic smooth muscle cells. Its effect is mediated at least in part via activation of p44/p42 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK.", 
    "23": "Experimental and clinical evidence documents the beneficial effects of blocking sympathetic activity and modulating heart rate to reduce risk for lethal events in ischemic heart disease. Beside beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, vagal activation is a meaningful approach but not yet easily attainable. Promising results were shown with low-dose atropine and scopolamine, but no follow-up was done because of significant adverse side effects. Pirenzepine is an atropine analogue approved to treat peptic ulcer disease in Europe that is devoid of central actions, which are mostly responsible for anti-muscarinic agents side effects. The vagomimetic action of IV low-dose pirenzepine was studied at rest under control conditions, at rest during acute coronary artery occlusion, and during exercise in conscious dogs with a healed anterior myocardial infarction (MI). The effects of pirenzepine were then compared, by internal control analysis, with those of atenolol (1 mg/kg). Increasing doses of pirenzepine (from 0.01 to 1 mg/kg) were tested in 11 dogs at rest by measuring time and frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV). The most effective dose (0.1 mg/kg) was used in the study. At the most effective dose, pirenzepine increased all measures of time domain HRV by 40-50%. However, the vagomimetic action of pirenzepine was lost during exercise and brief ischemia and no anti-arrhythmic action was observed. Conversely, pirenzepine effectively modulated the heart rate increase during acute ischemia at rest with an effect comparable to that of atenolol. The vagomimetic action of pirenzepine in the acutely ischemic heart supports the possibility that this intervention may be helpful for chronic autonomic modulation in post-MI patients.", 
    "24": "One-week treatment with the benzodiazepine (BZ) flurazepam (FZP), results in anticonvulsant tolerance, associated with reduced GABAA receptor (GABAR) subunit protein and miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current (mIPSC) amplitude in CA1 neurons of rat hippocampus. Because protein kinase A (PKA) has been shown to modulate GABAR function in CA1 pyramidal cells, the present study assessed whether GABAR dysfunction is associated with changes in PKA activity. Two days after 1-week FZP treatment, there were significant decreases in basal (- 30%) and total (- 25%) PKA activity, and a 40% reduction in PKA RIIbeta protein in the insoluble fraction of CA1 hippocampus. The soluble component of CA1 showed a significant increase in basal (100%) but not total PKA activity. Whole-cell recording in vitro showed a 50% reduction in mIPSC amplitude in CA1 pyramidal cells, with altered sensitivity to PKA modulators. Neurons from FZP-treated rats responded to 8-bromo-cAMP with a significant increase (31%) in mIPSC amplitude. Likewise, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), an endogenous PKA activator, caused a significant 36% increase in mIPSC amplitude in FZP-treated cells. Neither agent had a significant effect on mIPSC amplitude in control cells. This study supports a role for PKA in GABAR dysfunction after chronic FZP treatment.", 
    "25": "Divalproex sodium is a mood stabilizer used in the United States for the treatment of acute mania associated with bipolar disorder. Recently, olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, was approved for the treatment of acute mania. This study compares the clinical, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and economic outcomes of divalproex and olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania associated with bipolar disorder.", 
    "26": "This 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial included 120 subjects with DSM-IV bipolar disorder type I hospitalized for an acute manic episode recruited from 21 U.S. clinical centers. Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment with either divalproex or olanzapine and were followed in hospital for up to 21 days. If after 21 days clinical improvements (based on the Mania Rating Scale [MRS]) were not observed, subjects were discontinued. Subjects showing clinical improvement were treated for up to 12 weeks. HRQL was assessed using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q) after hospital discharge (baseline) and at 6 and 12 weeks. Medical resource use and costs were collected over the 12-week study.", 
    "27": "A total of 120 subjects (N = 63 divalproex, N = 57 olanzapine) were randomized, and 78 (65%) were followed beyond 21 days. No statistically significant differences between the treatment groups for baseline-to-endpoint MRS or Q-LES-Q scores were observed. Total 12-week outpatient medical costs were significantly lower for the divalproex-treated group (541 US dollars) compared with the olanzapine-treated group (1080 US dollars) (p =.004). There was no significant difference in total medical costs between the 2 groups (divalproex = 13,703 US dollars; olanzapine = 15,180 US dollars; p =.88).",

    "29": "Development of tolerance to motor-impairing effects of repeated administration of moderate diazepam doses (5.0-7.5 mg/kg; three times daily PO 3 weeks) was compared between mice deficient in the cerebellar granule cell-restricted GABAA receptor alpha6 subunit and their wild-type controls. The alpha6 -/- mice were more impaired by the initial challenge doses of diazepam (5 or 10 mg/kg) than their controls, but acquired partial tolerance by the second tests with the same doses 4-7 days later. Chronic treatment produced complete tolerance in both mouse lines. Ligand autoradiography revealed a significant reduction in baseline benzodiazepine and chloride channel site-bindings in various regions of the alpha6 -/- brains, but the chronic diazepam treatment did not consistently alter baseline or benzodiazepine site agonist and inverse agonist-modulated binding in the alpha6 -/- and wildtype mice. The results indicate that tolerance to motor-impairing actions of diazepam is independent of the diazepam-insensitive alpha6 subunit-containing receptors, which rules out the possibility that tolerance emerges as an increase in structurally benzodiazepine-insensitive receptor population.", 
    "30": "Liver failure is often accompanied by cognitive impairment and coma, a syndrome known as hepatic encephalopathy (HE). The administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist, is effective in reversing the symptoms of HE in many patients. These clinical observations gave rise to notions of an endogenous BZ-like mechanism in HE, but to date no viable candidate compounds have been characterized. We show here that the hemoglobin (Hb) metabolites hemin and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) interact with the BZ site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor and enhance inhibitory synaptic transmission in a manner similar to diazepam and zolpidem. This finding suggests that hemin and PPIX are neuroactive porphyrins capable of acting as endogenous ligands for the central BZ site. The accumulation of these porphyrins under pathophysiologic conditions provides a potentially novel mechanism for the central manifestations of HE.", 
    "31": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) has been suggested to be a contributory mediator in acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of the present study was to assess the role of CCK in the development of oxidative stress at different stages of AP induced by pancreatic duct obstruction (PDO) in rats, using L364,718 (a potent CCK-receptor antagonist) to block CCK action. Intra-acinar oxygen free radical (OFR) generation was analysed by flow cytometry using dihydrorhodamine-123 as a fluorogenic dye. Parallel measurements of pancreatic levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and of several parameters for the diagnosis of AP were performed in both untreated PDO rats and PDO rats receiving L364,718 (0.1 mg x 12 h(-1) x kg(-1)). Diagnosis parameters indicated a greater severity of AP in rats treated with the CCK antagonist. The increase in OFR generation observed in acinar cells up to 12 h after inducing AP was triggered at an earlier stages and reached higher values when L364,718 was administered. Accordingly, greater pancreatic GSH depletion was observed in rats with AP treated with the CCK antagonist. Two populations of acinar cells that were differentiated by flow cytometry, R1 and R2, showed similar behaviour with regard to OFR generation in PDO rats; however, R1 cells showed greater sensitivity to L364,718 administration, and thus OFR production was increased in R1 cells earlier than in R2 cells. In conclusion, CCK blockade anticipates and enhances the amount of OFR produced in acinar cells as a consequence of AP, thus leading to earlier development of and more severe disease. The detrimental effect of L364,718 in AP induced by PDO suggests that plasma CCK does not play a major role in the development of this AP model.", 
    "32": "A 75-years-old man with Alzheimer's disease, treated with the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil for 14 months, was scheduled for left colectomy under general anesthesia. During the procedure, succinylcholine-induced relaxation was prolonged and the effect of atracurium besylate was inadequate even at higher doses than those indicated for the patient's weight. Cholinesterase blood tests performed 10 months, 1 month and 10 days before surgery had demonstrated a gradual decrease in the duration of activity of the enzyme. Such an effect, which has been described for cholinesterase inhibitors like neostigmine and donepezil, would explain the prolonged effect of succinylcholine. After ruling out other causes for resistance to atracurium, we conclude that donepezil or its metabolites acted on muscle plaque, blocking acetylcholine hydrolysis and antagonizing atracurium.", 
    "33": "This study was performed to investigate the quality of different intravenous sedation techniques, and the correlation between the Bispectral Index (BIS) values and the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) scores. Eighty patients undergoing sinonasal surgery were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Group MF received midazolam and fentanyl, group PF received propofol and fentanyl, group MR received midazolam and remifentanil, and group PR received propofol and remifentanil. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure values were not different among the groups. SpO2 decreased only after intravenous medication in groups MF and MR (P < 0.017). Emesis was less common with propofol. A positive relationship existed between the BIS values and OAA/S scores during the operation in all groups and the strongest correlation was observed in group PR (r = 0.565 and P < 0.001). In conclusion, these four intravenous sedation techniques did not change mean arterial pressure, heart rate or SpO2 clinically and produced a similar level of light sedation. The BIS was useful for monitoring of sedation during sinonasal surgery under local anaesthesia with intravenous sedation.", 
    "34": "We studied the effect of naloxone--an antagonist of the opioid receptors--on sensitivity of Cl(-)-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase from the plasma membrane fraction of bream brain (Abramis brama L.) to GABAa-ergic substances. Preincubation of the plasma membranes with 1-100 microM naloxone increased the basal Mg(2+)-ATPase activity and suppressed its activation by chloride ions. The same effects were observed in the presence of the agonists of GABAa/benzodiazepine receptors: 0.1-100 microM GABA, 1-500 microM pentobarbital, and 0.1-100 microM phenazepam. Naloxone (10 microM) inhibited the activation of the basal Mg(2+)-ATPase by the studied ligands and regenerated the enzyme sensitivity to Cl-. However, the effect of naloxone was not observed in the presence of high concentrations of pentobarbital (500 microM) and phenazepam (100 microM). The obtained data show that naloxone modulates the activity of Cl(-)-activated Mg(2+)-ATPase from the plasma membranes of bream brain and antagonizes the GABAa receptor ligands.", 
    "35": "There are about 60,000 chemical substances which may cause poisoning. Identifying the cause substances is, therefore, very important for patient at emergency department. Triage is an immunoassay kit for the qualitative test for the metabolites of 8 major abuse drugs in urine. We assessed the usefullness of Triage on two patient groups. The first Group consists of the patients considered having not taken substances at initial diagnosis; the second Group consists of the patients considered having taken substances. The result are as follows. 1) The rate of Triage positive patients in the first Group were: attempt-suicide 23%, coma 24%, shock 10%, trauma 7%, respectively. Except for the habitually used medicine, narcotic and stimulant drugs were detected. In the first Group, negative result of Triage was effective in diagnosing the patients as not poisoned, excluding the possitivity of 8 major drugs usage. 2) The rate of Triage positive patients in the second Group were very high: attempt-suicide 77%, coma 51%, shock 57%, trauma 30%, respectively, showing mostly any of 8 major drugs were the cause of poisoning. In the second Group, positive result of Triage was effective in diagnosing the patient as poisoning or as coexisting poisoning with other diseases. 3) The specificity of Triage diagnosis in the first Group was 80% (113/142). The specificity and the sensitivity in the second Group were 64% (50/78) and 97% (74/76), respectively. These results means that Triage is very useful for diagnosis on 8 major drugs poisoning. 4) Triage is efficient for identifying the cause substances in drug poisoning and, therefore, can save medical expense.

    "46": "Bombesin has been shown to have trophic effects on the gastrointestinal tissue. Bombesin has direct mitogenic effects besides stimulating release of gastric hormones. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of bombesin in hemorrhagic shock-induced stress ulcers in rats, and the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors in this activity. Hemorrhagic shock was created by withdrawing 3 ml blood/200 g b.w. of rats. At the end of the 1-hour hypovolemic shock period, histological analysis, gastric ulcer index, gastric myeloperoxidase activity and gastric protein oxidation levels were determined. When given before the hemorrhage, subcutaneous bombesin (10 microg/kg) reduced macroscopically gastric ulcer index (p < 0.05). Blockade of CCK-A receptors with intraperitoneal MK-329 (1 mg/kg) did not reverse bombesin-induced gastroprotection. Blockade of CCK-B receptors with intraperitoneal L-365,260 (25 mg/kg) reversed bombesin-induced gastroprotection. Blockade of the two receptors resulted in no gastroprotection at all. It is concluded that bombesin treatment attenuated hemorrhagic shock-induced stress ulcers in rats via CCK receptors.", 
    "47": "A mouse protein that interacts with the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory subunit RIalpha (PKA-RIalpha), named PBR and PKA associated protein 7 (PAP7) was identified and shown to be involved in hormone-induced steroid biosynthesis in testicular Leydig cells. In the present study, mouse PAP7 cDNA was extended by 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; and a 3432 bp sequence, encoding a 525-amino-acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 60 kDa, was re-assembled. Mouse and human PAP7 share an 85% amino acid identity and contain a conserved acyl-CoA-binding protein/diazepam binding inhibitor (ACBP/DBI) motif. ACBP/DBI has been identified as the endogenous PBR ligand able to stimulate mitochondrial steroid formation in all steroidogenic cells. The full-length mouse PAP7 gene was cloned and assembled by screening a BAC clone, polymerase chain reaction and searching the mouse genome database. The gene is approximately 29 kb in length and includes eight exons and seven introns. Although it is shorter than the human PAP7 gene, all exons are conserved between the mouse and human. The mouse PAP7 gene was mapped to chromosome 1H3-5 by fluorescence in situ hybridization in agreement with in silico search of the mouse genome database that mapped the PAP7 cDNA sequence to the 1H4 area. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy demonstrated that PAP7 is mainly localized in the trans-Golgi apparatus and mitochondria in mouse tumor Leydig cells, in agreement with its proposed function in targeting the PKA isoenzyme to organelles rich in PBR, i.e. mitochondria, where phosphorylation of specific protein substrates mediates the hormone-induced steroid formation.", 
    "48": "Previous in vivo microdialysis studies have shown increased spontaneous release of 5-HT in the hippocampus of adult behaving rats exposed to prenatal protein malnutrition. Furthermore, behavioral studies have shown that adolescent rats (PD30) that have been prenatally protein malnourished demonstrate an increased sensitivity to the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP). Given this altered sensitivity to benzodiazepines in adolescent malnourished rats, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that the increased release of 5-HT in the hippocampus is present in adolescent rats and that this release is modulated by CDP. An altered release of 5-HT at PD30 would suggest an early developmental change associated with prenatal malnutrition. PD30 rats were implanted with microdialysis probes into the dorsal hippocampus and 5-HT release was monitored before and after administration of CDP. As previously reported in adult rats, release of 5-HT was significantly elevated in the dorsal hippocampus of PD30 rats as compared to well-nourished 30-day-old controls. Administration of CDP did not affect the release of 5-HT from the hippocampal formation of well-nourished rats but significantly decreased the elevated release of 5-HT in the malnourished rats. Following CDP, 5-HT release in the malnourished rats was at the same levels as release in well-nourished animals. Benzodiazepines have been reported to decrease extracellular 5-HT in stressed rats but not in unstressed rats. Thus, the elevated 5-HT release in the hippocampus in rats exposed to prenatal protein malnutrition may be associated with an increased response to stress. These data support other data that prenatal protein malnutrition alters the response to stressful stimuli possibly through changes in the GABAergic and/or serotonergic systems.",

Information concerning sex, gender, drug consumption, time, place and circumstances of death were analysed. A number of 605 cases were recorded; in 518 cases a toxicological analysis was possible and in 171 an autopsy was performed. When it was possible to determine the cause of death form the information available, acute drug intoxication was recorded in 65%. Heroin head the list of identified substances. Sixty-three percent of the specimens showed a combination of several substances, especially a combination of morphine, benzodiazepines, other medications and alcohol. In comparison with other studies the percentage of methadone-positive specimens is low, even though the proportion of specimens positive for methadone increased from 1989 to 2000. This analysis is discussed using background information concerning the management of substitution therapy and the available literature.",

    "53": "In the plus-maze test, the exploratory activity of the homozygous (-/-) mice was significantly higher compared to their wild-type (+/+) littermates. However, the wild-type (+/+) mice displayed higher sensitivity to the anxiolytic-like action of diazepam. Even the lowest dose of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) induced a significant increase of open arm entries in the wild-type (+/+) mice. A similar effect in the homozygous (-/-) mice was established after the administration of diazepam 1 mg/kg. The highest dose of diazepam (3 mg/kg) caused a prominent anxiolytic-like effect in the wild-type (+/+) mice, whereas in the homozygous (-/-) animals suppression of locomotor activity was evident. The performance of the homozygous (-/-) mice in the rotarod test did not differ from that of the wild-type (+/+) littermates. However, a difference between the wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (-/-) animals became evident after treatment with diazepam. Diazepam (0.5 and 3 mg/kg) induced significantly stronger impairment of motor co-ordination in the homozygous (-/-) mice compared to their wild-type (+/+) littermates. The density of benzodiazepine binding sites was increased in the cerebellum, but not in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, of the homozygous (-/-) mice.", 
    "54": "Female mice lacking CCK2 receptors are less anxious than their wild-type (+/+) littermates. The reduced anxiety in homozygous (-/-) mice probably explains why the administration of a higher dose of diazepam is necessary to induce an anxiolytic-like action in these animals. The highest dose of diazepam (3 mg/kg) induced significantly stronger suppression of locomotor activity and impairment of motor co-ordination in the homozygous (-/-) mice compared to the wild-type (+/+) littermates. The increase in the action of diazepam is probably related to the elevated density of benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebellum of homozygous (-/-) mice. The present study seems to be in favour of increased tone of the GABAergic system in mice without CCK2 receptors.",

Two hours after drug administration, animals were killed. Patterns of activated cells were observed by immunohistochemistry for Fos-like antibodies in regions previously suggested as responding to all antipsychotic drugs, including nucleus accumbens, central amygdala, and central medial thalamus. Cells staining for Fos were counted by semi-automated methods. RESULTS. A very similar pattern and number of Fos positive cells in nucleus accumbens, central amygdala, and central medial thalamus followed administration of each antipsychotic drug. The numbers of apparently activated cells were much greater following antipsychotic drug administration than after vehicle, with differences between each drug and vehicle being highly statistically significant in each region. Lorazepam produced apparent activation of cells of the central amygdala similar in degree and location but not identical in distribution to that of antipsychotic drugs. Diphenhydramine produced no apparent activation of cells in any of the sites tested.",

    "78": "A 44-year-old First Nations man presented to the emergency department with headache, nystagmus, diplopia, and ataxia. Apart from a long-standing seizure disorder, his past medical history was unremarkable. The antiepileptic drug regimen of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and lamotrigine had been unchanged for almost 5 months. Total phenytoin serum concentration reported 2 weeks prior to hospital admission was 8 micro g/L. Two days prior to admission, he was prescribed amoxicillin and diazepam; he denied use of nonprescription or herbal medications. The serum phenytoin concentration drawn in the hospital was 37 micro g/mL. Both phenytoin and diazepam were stopped, and the symptoms resolved. His neurologic abnormalities were attributed to phenytoin toxicity caused by an interaction with diazepam.", 
    "79": "The literature documenting a potential interaction between diazepam and phenytoin is conflicting. Case reports and controlled studies have demonstrated both increases and decreases in serum phenytoin concentrations when these agents were administered concomitantly. Phenytoin induces the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP2C, CYP2D, and CYP3A; however, phenytoin is eliminated predominantly by CYP2C9- and CYP2C19-dependent hepatic metabolism. Diazepam is one example of a drug that is extensively metabolized by CYP2C19 and could potentially influence phenytoin elimination by acting as an alternate substrate for this isoenzyme. In our patient, the timing of drug administration, clinical and physical examination findings, and laboratory data suggest that diazepam therapy resulted in phenytoin toxicity. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the adverse clinical effects observed and phenytoin and diazepam coadministration in this patient.",

Rats were administered 3 mg/kg diazepam for 21 consecutive days and the changes observed in different regions of rat brain at the sub-cellular level. Mitochondria from cerebrum showed a 27% lowering of TBARS whereas those from cerebellum and brain stem showed 48 and 24% enhanced MDA levels respectively. No significant alteration in the SOD isozymes was observed after the dose schedule. The mitochondrial glutathione reductase (GR) activity showed a decrease in all the regions with maximum decrease (36%) recorded in brain stem while post mitochondrial fraction showed significant lowering in cerebrum (37%). Total -SH content increased in all the three regions with maximum enhancement recorded in cerebellum while the free thiol content also showed significant changes (p < 0.001) in cerebellum and brain stem. One week after the withdrawal of the drug MDA levels decreased by 38% in cerebrum and 53% each in mitochondrial fractions of cerebellum and brain stem. Regional heterogeneity in response was also observed in the post mitochondrial fractions. Mn-SOD showed lowered activity in cerebellum (22%) and in brain stem (15%). The mitochondrial GR activity decreased in all the regions being highest in cerebrum with no significant change in post mitochondrial fractions. The total and free -SH content in the withdrawn animals increased by 46% in cerebellum with no change in the other two regions. The results indicate towards lower oxidative phenomenon during 3 weeks treatment with diazepam while abrupt withdrawal causes lowering of antioxidant defenses which showed regional heterogeneity. A decrease in peroxidative decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids of membranes was observed on withdrawal, which could be due to stabilisation of membranes after long-term binding of diazepam.",

In this study, we investigated the spinally-mediated analgesic interaction between midazolam and bupivacaine by using the tail-flick and formalin tests in rats with chronically implanted catheters. Behavioral effects were also observed. The dose dependency of analgesia and the 50% effective doses of intrathecal midazolam and bupivacaine were determined, and then the interaction of these two drugs was examined with an isobolographic analysis. Both drugs had dose-dependent analgesic effects in both the tail-flick test and the formalin test.

    "95": "Acute effects of the abused inhalant toluene resemble those of CNS depressant drugs. Since abuse of toluene involves repeated use, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of repeated or continuous exposure to toluene and to compare these effects to those of other inhalants and depressants. In experiment 1, ICR mice exposed continuously to 250 ppm toluene via inhalation for four days developed mild dependence upon termination that was characterized by an increase in severity of handling-induced convulsions. However, administration of the convulsants, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), did not differentially affect toluene- vs. air-exposed mice. In experiment 2, CFW mice (but not ICR mice) developed cross-sensitization to the initial locomotor stimulatory effects of toluene following four days of injections with 10 mg/kg/day diazepam. Previous findings have shown that 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCE) produced robust dependence and cross-sensitization to diazepam's locomotor effects when tested under similar conditions. The present results suggest that the dependence and cross-sensitization with diazepam produced by toluene are milder than those induced by TCE. Further, these studies add to increasing evidence that abused inhalants do not have identical pharmacological effects.", 
    "96": "The interaction of gaboxadol (THIP; 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol), ethanol and a series of benzodiazepine site agonists including diazepam, flunitrazepam, lorazepam, indiplon, zaleplon and zolpidem has been characterized at human alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2S) gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and in the rat cortical wedge preparation. At the expressed receptors, gaboxadol and the benzodiazepine site agonists interacted synergistically and ethanol did not further enhance this potentiation. In contrast, in the rat cortical wedge preparation, where the inhibition of spontaneous activity was assessed, much weaker effects of the benzodiazepine site agonists were seen. Furthermore, ethanol did not further potentiate the effects of gaboxadol. These findings suggest that gaboxadol in functionally intact tissue may interact with a receptor population, which is insensitive to the modulation by benzodiazepines.", 
    "97": "Intense anxiety has been postulated to trigger relapse to abuse of opiates and psychomotor stimulants. Preclinical research methodologies need to be developed to adequately characterize the affective or emotional component of withdrawal. Classically, withdrawal from psychomotor stimulants and opiates focuses on somatic and autonomic indices, foremost based on observational assessments and, additionally, on measures of disrupted conditioned behavior. These measures depict the intensity and time course of withdrawal from specific doses of opiates and psychomotor stimulants, but require large numbers of subjects due to single use of each individual. Behavioral disruptions have been attributed to anhedonia, a core symptom of drug withdrawal, as well as major depressive and psychotic disorders. In spite of some pharmacological validation, inferences about anxiety-like disturbances, based on observed somatic and autonomic signs or on changes in conditioned responses, have to remain tentative. High-pitched vocalizations may communicate affective expressions and, in rodents, different kinds of ultrasonic vocalizations communicate maternal separation distress in infants, accompany the intensely arousing phases of agonistic confrontations, signal submission and distress in defensive responses to threats and painful events, and are part of the excitatory and inhibitory phases of sexual behavior. While acute treatment with opiates, psychomotor stimulants, alcohol and benzodiazepines suppresses ultrasonic vocalizations in the 22-25-kHz range, rats emit high rates of ultrasonic vocalizations upon withdrawal from prolonged exposure to these drugs, particularly if they have been startled. Peak rates of ultrasonic distress calls occur ca. 1-3 days after cessation of cocaine or opiate treatment and decline within 5-7 days. Ultrasonic vocalizations during withdrawal from cocaine, alcohol or benzodiazepines can be attenuated by renewed access to the drug. It will be informative to learn how the neural circuit mediating vocalizations interacts with the ones subserving self-administration of alcohol, opiates and psychomotor stimulants.", 
    "98": "Derivatives of the muscarinic antagonist 3-quinuclidinyl-4-iodobenzilate (QNB), particularly [123I]-(R,R)-I-QNB, are currently being assessed as in vivo ligands to monitor muscarinic receptors in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), relating changes to disease symptoms and to treatment response with cholinergic medication. To assist in the evaluation of in vivo binding, muscarinic receptor density in post-mortem human brain was measured by autoradiography with [125I]-(R,R)-I-QNB and [125I]-(R,S)-I-QNB and compared to M1 ([3H]pirenzepine) and M2 and M4 ([3H]AF-DX 384) receptor binding. Binding was calculated in tissue containing striatum, globus pallidus (GPe), claustrum, and cingulate and insula cortex, in cases of AD, DLB, Parkinson's disease (PD) and normal elderly controls. Pirenzepine, AF-DX 384 and (R,S)-I-QNB binding in the striatum correlated positively with increased Alzheimer-type pathology, and AF-DX 384 and (R,R)-I-QNB cortical binding correlated positively with increased Lewy body (LB) pathology; however, striatal pirenzepine binding correlated negatively with cortical LB pathology. M1 receptors were significantly reduced in striatum in DLB compared to AD, PD, and controls and there was a significant correlation between M1 and dopamine D2 receptor densities. [3H]AF-DX 384 binding was higher in the striatum and GPe in AD. Binding of [125I]-(R,R)-I-QNB, which may reflect increased muscarinic M4 receptors, was higher in cortex and claustrum in DLB and AD. [125I]-(R,S)-I-QNB binding was higher in the GPe in AD. Low M1 and D2 receptors in DLB imply altered regulation of the striatal projection neurons which express these receptors. Low density of striatal M1 receptors may relate to the extent of movement disorder in DLB, and to a reduced risk of parkinsonism with acetylcholinesterase inhibition.",

A considerably reduced runtime was achieved while maintaining good chromatographic separations. This significantly improved separation speed demanded higher throughput on sample extraction. To this end, monolithic separations were coupled on-line with high-flow extraction, which allowed for the fast extraction and separation of samples containing multiple analytes. An evaluation of this system was performed using a mixture of fenfluramine, temazepam, oxazepam, and tamoxifen in plasma. A total cycle time of 1.2 min was achieved which included both sample extraction and subsequent monolithic column separation via column switching. A total of over 400 plasma samples were analyzed in less than 10 h. The sensitivity and responses were reproducible throughout the run. The system has been routinely used in the authors' laboratory for high-throughput quantitation of compounds in biological fluids in support of drug discovery programs. The assay for samples from a 9-in-1 dog pharmacokinetic study is shown as an example to demonstrate the capability of this system.",

After the addition of deuterium labelled standards of F,7-AF and N-DMF, the drugs were isolated from urine or plasma by automated solid-phase extraction, then chromatographed in an isocratic elution mode with a salt-free eluent. The quantification was performed using selected ion monitoring of protonated molecular ions (M+H(+)). Experiments were carried out to improve the extraction recovery (81-100%) and the sensitivity (limit of detection 0.025 ng/ml for F and 7-AF, 0.040 ng/ml for N-DMF and 0.200 ng/ml for 3-OHF). The method was applied to the determination of F and metabolites in drug addicts including withdrawal urine samples and in one date-rape plasma and urine sample.", 
    "101": "This study deals with the competitive interactions of sulindac (CAS 38194-50-2) with specific markers for the major binding areas on human serum albumin (HSA): phenylbutazone (CAS 50-33-9) and warfarin (CAS 129-06-6) for Site I, and diazepam (CAS 439-14-5) for Site II. The method used is high-performance liquid affinity chromatography with HSA-immobilized stationary phase. The affinity constants during the cobinding are determined, and the major thermodynamic parameters are calculated. Based on that the nature of the intermolecular interactions involved in the binding process is hypothesized. The cobinding of sulindac and phenylbutazone is simple competitive and is dominated by hydrogen bonds. The binding affinity of sulindac is significantly decreased by R-warfarin (anticooperative binding), and conformational changes resulting in alteration of the binding mechanisms (electrostatic as well as hydrophobic interactions) are supposed. S-Warfarin hardly affects the binding affinity of sulindac. Sulindac competes with diazepam for two types of binding site: high affinity Site II where the cobinding seems to be dominated by hydrophobic bonding, and low affinity Site I, the latter affinity being significantly decreased (anticooperative binding). These results contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the binding of the investigated drugs with HSA.",

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this medication in more usual care outpatient settings. A consecutive series of 15 patients entered an open, uncontrolled 8-week trial of olanzapine monotherapy. Inclusion criteria included significant hypomanic or manic symptoms greater than or equal to 15 on the Young Mania Rating Scale and no psychotic symptoms. The majority of patients experienced significant decreases in mania ratings and more limited improvement on depression ratings. Most patients reported adverse events consistent with other studies, but few discontinued due to these complaints. This case series highlights the individual variation in response to a proven medication. Furthermore, it highlights that those medications effective at one end of the mood spectrum may not be equally or simultaneously effective with other symptoms, emphasizing the complexity of treating bipolar illness.",

So far, the most promising results, that we report here, have been obtained with clozapine. To a lesser extent, quetiapine and olanzapine, both clozapine analogues, have also shown promising results. Further to these observations, the present paper critically reviews the advantages associated with clozapine, quetiapine and olanzapine, and their relevance to the treatment of addiction among schizophrenic patients. Six characteristics seem to distinguish clozapine, quetiapine and olanzapine from the first-generation antipsychotics: (1) acting preferentially on the reward system, these second-generation antipsychotics (mainly clozapine and quetiapine) induce almost no extrapyramidal symptoms; (2) quickly dissociating from D(2), theses drugs (mainly clozapine and quetiapine) seem not to induce dysphoria, unlike conventional antipsychotics like haloperidol;(3) these drugs (mainly clozapine) seem more effective in the treatment of negative symptoms than conventional antipsychotics; (4) because of a diversified activity on several serotoninergic and noradrenergic receptors, these drugs positively alter mood, which does not seem to be the case with conventional antipsychotics, except for flupenthixol; (5) these drugs have a positive impact on cognition, which is not the case with the first-generation antipsychotics; (6) unlike conventional antipsychotics, these drugs seem to have a moderate affinity for 5-HT(3), the receptor on which ondansetron, an anti-craving medication, acts.", 
    "109": "The functional properties of spontaneous, glutamatergic EPSCs and non-NMDA receptors in AII amacrine cells were studied in whole cells and patches from slices of the rat retina using single and dual electrode voltage clamp recording. Pharmacological analysis verified that the EPSCs (Erev approximately 0 mV) were mediated exclusively by AMPA-type receptors. EPSCs displayed a wide range of waveforms, ranging from simple monophasic events to more complex multiphasic events. Amplitude distributions of EPSCs were moderately skewed towards larger amplitudes (modal peak 23 pA). Interevent interval histograms were best fitted with a double exponential function. Monophasic, monotonically rising EPSCs displayed very fast kinetics with an average 10-90 % rise time of approximately 340 micro s and a decay phase well fitted by a single exponential (taudecay approximately 760 micro s). The specific AMPA receptor modulator cyclothiazide markedly slowed the decay phase of spontaneous EPSCs (taudecay approximately 3 ms). An increase in temperature decreased both 10-90 % rise time and taudecay with Q10 values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. The decay kinetics were slower at positive membrane potentials compared to negative membrane potentials (205 mV/e-fold change in taudecay). Step depolarization of individual presynaptic rod bipolar cells or OFF-cone bipolar cells evoked transient, CNQX-sensitive responses in AII amacrine cells with average peak amplitudes of approximately 330 pA. Ultrafast application of brief (approximately 1 ms) or long (approximately 500 ms) pulses of glutamate to outside-out patches evoked strongly desensitizing responses with very fast deactivation and desensitization kinetics, well fitted by single (taudecay approximately 1.1 ms) and double exponential (tau1 approximately 3.5 ms; tau2 approximately 21 ms) functions, respectively. Double-pulse experiments indicated fast recovery from desensitization (tau approximately 12.4 ms). Our results indicate that spontaneous, AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs in AII amacrine cells have very fast, voltage-dependent kinetics that can be well accounted for by the kinetic properties of the AMPA receptors themselves",

    "114": "About 15% of hospital admissions of elderly patients in the Netherlands are caused by adverse effects of drugs. With polypharmacy there is an increased chance of adverse effects occurring. It is not always possible to reduce polypharmacy in the elderly. Polypharmacy is often associated with drug interactions which result in an increased or decreased effect, or the occurrence of adverse effects. Due to changes in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drugs in the elderly, the effect of interactions is more clinically relevant. Pharmacokinetic interactions influence absorption, liver metabolism or excretion by the kidneys. In particular, interactions with drugs that have a narrow pharmacotherapeutic spectrum can result in serious adverse effects: anticonvulsives, anti-Parkinson drugs, antipsychotics, coumarin derivates, digitalis preparations, lithium salts, opiates, sulphonylurea derivates, tricyclic antidepressants and verapamil. The most important pharmacodynamic changes in the elderly concern an increased sensitivity of the target organ. This is particularly the case for substances which have an effect on the central nervous system, such as antidepressants and antipsychotics, but also applies to benzodiazepines, coumarin derivatives and digoxin. When an unexpected adverse effect occurs in a patient or a previously effective therapy suddenly fails, it is wise to consider drug interaction as a possible cause.",

Sexual assault perpetrated on both women and men, while incapacitated by so-called date-rape drugs, recently became the focus of many investigations conducted by law enforcement agencies in the US throughout the 1990s; an alarming increase in reports of this crime as well as in the number of scientific publications on drug-facilitated sexual assault has been observed. The list of drugs reportedly associated with sexual assault is long and among others includes flunitrazepam with other benzodiazepines such as diazepam, temazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, as well as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), ketamine, and scopolamine. We discuss the most recent analytical developments in the toxicological investigation of drug-facilitated rape designed to reveal drug presence and that may help successfully prosecute perpetrators.", 
    "117": "AWD 131-138 [1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-morpholino-imidazolin-2-one], a new low-affinity partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist with potent anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties in rodent models, was studied in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate intramuscular (i.m.) injections of midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) from injections of vehicle. Diazepam produced midazolam-like responding at cumulative doses of 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg i.m. and decreased rates of responding at 3.0 mg/kg (plasma levels of about 400 ng/ml). In contrast, AWD 131-138 did not produce midazolam-like responding or alter response rates at cumulative doses up to 18.0 mg/kg i.m. (plasma levels over 2100 ng/ml). Other monkeys were trained to intravenously (i.v.) self-administer cocaine (56.0 microg/kg/injection). When AWD 131-138 (10-100 microg/kg/injection) was studied by substitution, responding declined to vehicle substitution levels within three sessions. At the dose of 100 microg/kg i.v. AWD 131-138, sufficient drug was self-administered during the first session (about 3.5 mg/kg) to produce plasma levels above 1000 ng/ml, yet responding over the next two sessions dropped to vehicle levels. The failure of AWD 131-138 to produce benzodiazepine-like discriminative effects and the absence of drug self-administration behavior when substituted for cocaine suggest that its abuse liability is low.",

    "122": "This review covers the effect of drugs affecting anxiety using four psychological procedures for inducing experimental anxiety applied to healthy volunteers and patients with anxiety disorders. The first is aversive conditioning of the skin conductance responses to tones. The second is simulated public speaking, which consists of speaking in front of a video camera, with anxiety being measured with psychometric scales. The third is the Stroop Color-Word test, in which words naming colors are painted in the same or in a different shade, the incongruence generating a cognitive conflict. The last test is a human version of a thoroughly studied animal model of anxiety, fear-potentiated startle, in which the eye-blink reflex to a loud noise is recorded. The evidence reviewed led to the conclusion that the aversive conditioning and potentiated startle tests are based on classical conditioning of anticipatory anxiety. Their sensitivity to benzodiazepine anxiolytics suggests that these models generate an emotional state related to generalized anxiety disorder. On the other hand, the increase in anxiety determined by simulated public speaking is resistant to benzodiazepines and sensitive to drugs affecting serotonergic neurotransmission. This pharmacological profile, together with epidemiological evidence indicating its widespread prevalence, suggests that the emotional state generated by public speaking represents a species-specific response that may be related to social phobia and panic disorder. Because of scant pharmacological data, the status of the Stroop Color-Word test remains uncertain. In spite of ethical and economic constraints, human experimental anxiety constitutes a valuable tool for the study of the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.", 
    "123": "In spite of the accumulation of knowledge regarding the neuropharmacological action of benzodiazepines (Bz), the physiological process by which their sedative/hypnotic effects are induced remains poorly understood. We conducted a single-blind, crossover trial to evaluate the role of the thermoregulatory process in sleepiness and impaired psychomotor performance induced by a standard Bz, diazepam (DZP). Each of the eight healthy young male volunteers (mean age, 19.75 years; range, 18-23 years) was given a single oral dose of either 5 or 10 mg of DZP or placebo 12 h after his average sleep onset time. Changes in plasma DZP concentration, proximal body temperature (p-BT), distal body temperature (d-BT), subjective sleepiness measured by the Visual Analog Scale and Stanford Sleepiness Scale, and psychomotor performance measured by Choice Reaction Time were monitored under a modified constant routine condition in which various factors affecting thermoregulation, alertness, and psychomotor performances were strictly controlled. Orally administered DZP induced a significant transient decrease in p-BT and psychomotor performance as well as an increase in d-BT and subjective sleepiness. Distal-p-BT gradient (DPG; difference between d-BT and p-BT), which is an indicator of blood flow in distal skin regions, showed a strong positive correlation with the plasma DZP concentration, indicating that DZP in clinical doses promotes heat loss in a dose-dependent manner. The DPG also correlated positively with the magnitude of subjective sleepiness and impaired psychomotor performance. These findings indicate that the sedative/hypnotic effects of Bz could be due, at least in part, to changes in thermoregulation, especially in the process of heat loss, in humans.", 
    "124": "Cholecystokinin-tetrapeptide (CCK-4) induces panic attacks both in patients with panic disorder (PD) and healthy volunteers. It has been shown that panic elicited by CCK-4 is improved after treatment with antidepressants. Moreover, a reduction of CCK-4-induced panic has also been demonstrated after treatment with lorazepam in single subjects and after selective GABAergic treatment with vigabatrin. Although benzodiazepines are widely used as anxiolytics, no controlled study on the effects of benzodiazepines on CCK-4-induced panic symptoms is available so far. Therefore, we investigated the effects of alprazolam and placebo on CCK-4-induced panic symptoms in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A total of 30 healthy subjects were challenged with 50 microg CCK-4. Out of these 30 subjects, 26 showed a marked panic response to CCK-4. Subjects were rechallenged after a 7-day interval and treated with 1 mg alprazolam or placebo 1 h prior to the second CCK-4 challenge. Panic was assessed using the acute panic inventory (API) and a DSM-IV-derived panic symptom scale (PSS). Moreover, the number of reported symptoms and self-rated anxiety and arousal were recorded. We found a significant reduction of the API and PSS scores and of the number of reported symptoms compared to placebo. Moreover, compared to placebo the CCK-4-induced ACTH and cortisol release were significantly attenuated during the CCK-4 challenge after alprazolam treatment. However, also placebo treatment reduced CCK-4-induced anxiety and HPA-axis activation to a certain extent. In conclusion, our data show that alprazolam reduces CCK-4-induced panic, which supports the hypothesis of a possible interaction between the GABA and the CCK system.",

These data may give information on the anesthetic state.", 
    "126": "The relation between the electrically evoked blink and corneal reflexes and the depth of sedation and anesthesia induced with intravenous midazolam was investigated. Ten patients received i.v. increments of midazolam (1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 3 mg, 3 mg, etc., until a 21-mg total dose) to create a step-wise deepening of sedation and anesthesia. Depth of anesthesia was assessed by the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAAS) scale, ranging from 5 ( = awake and alert) to 0 ( = no motor response to tetanic stimulation).", 
    "127": "Latency of the first (R1) and second (R2) blink components and the corneal (C) reflex component increased, whereas duration and area decreased with increasing depth of sedation and anesthesia. R1 was last seen at an OAAS score [mean (SD)] of 1.8 (0.8), R2 at a score of 3.1 (1.1), C at a score of 3.8 (0.8), and R3 at 4.8 (0.5). These end-points were all statistically different from each other, except R2 vs. C.",

While there were some subjects who had greater increases in plasma ALP concentrations, more than 100%, in response to the coadministration of FLV among the subjects with no mutated or one mutated allele, there are no subjects who had increases in plasma ALP concentrations of more than 50% among the subjects with two mutated alleles. The differences of these variances among the three genotype groups reached a level of significance ( P<0.05).",

    "133": "The search for small-molecule drugs that act at peptide hormone receptors has resulted in the identification of a wide variety of antagonists. In contrast, the discovery of nonpeptide agonists has been far more elusive. We have used a constitutively active mutant of the cholecystokinin 2 receptor (CCK-2R) as a sensitive screen to detect ligand activity. Functional assessment of structural analogs of the prototype CCK-2R antagonist, L-365,260 [3R-N- (2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl)-N'-(3-methylphenyl)urea], resulted in the identification of a series of agonists. Each of the active molecules is an S enantiomer, whereas the corresponding R stereoisomers have little or no activity. Further in vitro and in vivo assessment at the wild-type receptor indicated that efficacy of the two most active ligands approached that of the endogenous hormone. The function of selected R and S enantiomers was differentially sensitive to a point mutation, N353L, within the putative CCK-2R ligand pocket. The results of this study highlight the potential of constitutively active receptors as drug screening tools and the interdependence of ligand stereochemistry and receptor conformation in defining drug efficacy.", 
    "134": "Glial cells form a structural and functional network with complex cell-cell communication pathways that enable fast and slow signalling amongst themselves as well as with neurons. They exert regulatory influence on normal synaptic transmission and alter it in disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that an understanding of brain function in disease conditions requires a better account of the highly plastic, disease-associated changes in glial physiology in vivo. Particularly, microglia, the brain's ubiquitous but normally inconspicuous immune effector cell, are prominently involved in many brain diseases. They respond rapidly and in a territorially highly confined way to subtle, acute and chronic pathological stimuli. Detection of microglial activation provides diagnostically useful formal parameters of disease, such as the accurate spatial localisation, disease progression and the secondary neurodegenerative or adaptive changes remote from the primary site of disease. The latter has potential relevance for the understanding of disease-induced brain plasticity. Systematic attempts are now undertaken, using positron emission tomography and a ligand with relative selectivity for activated microglia, to develop generic imaging tools for a cellular in vivo neuropathology.",

    "136": "Adhesion assays were performed using breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 and various concentrations of vitronectin or fibronectin. Migration assays were performed using the same cell lines and invasion chambers with 8 microm pore polycarbonate membranes. Blocking antibodies and specific peptidomimetic inhibitors to integrin receptors were used to identify the integrin subunits reacting with vitronectin and fibronectin.", 
    "137": "While both breast cancer cell lines adhered to and migrated toward vitronectin and fibronectin, MDA-MB-435 had a higher maximum binding to vitronectin and MDA-MB-231 had a higher maximum binding to fibronectin. Anti-beta1 antibody inhibited the adhesion and migration of MDA-MB-231 to fibronectin and the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 to vitronectin but had no effect on vitronectin-induced adhesion or migration of MDA-MB-435. The alpha(v)beta3/alpha(v)beta5 antagonist, SB 265123, inhibited MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 adhesion and migration to vitronectin but had no effect on migration to fibronectin in either cell line.", 
    "138": "We conclude that the integrin subunits beta1, alpha(v)beta3, and alpha(v)beta5 can be involved in breast cancer cell adhesion and migration to vitronectin and fibronectin.

    "139": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) was found to increase glutamate release in the developing visual cortex. We investigated the cellular mechanisms of this effect and its dependence on extracellular and intracellular Ca2+. The NGF-induced enhancement of glutamate release from superfused rat visual cortex synaptosomes required mild depolarization. Removal of external Ca2+ during depolarization with 15 mM K+ only halved the effect of NGF on glutamate release. NGF increased [Ca2+]i in K+-depolarized synaptosomes preloaded with fura-2AM both in the presence and in the absence of external Ca2+. The effects of NGF on glutamate release and [Ca2+]i elevation were prevented by an anti-TrkA receptor monoclonal antibody. NGF increased synaptosomal inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (InsP3) during depolarization and the InsP3 receptor antagonist heparin abolished the effect of NGF on evoked glutamate release both in the presence and in the absence of external Ca2+. The effect of NGF on the evoked glutamate release in Ca2+-free medium was abolished by dantrolene, a ryanodine receptor blocker, by CGP 37157, a blocker of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and by pretreatment of synaptosomes with caffeine. NGF significantly increased the depolarization-induced activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the subsequent phosphorylation of synapsin I in the absence of external Ca2+ and the NGF effect on evoked glutamate release was inhibited by the CaMKII inhibitors KN-93 and CaMKII 281-309 peptide but not by the MAP kinase inhibitor PD 98059. Thus, the effect of NGF on evoked glutamate release is linked to an increase in [Ca2+]i contributed by both Ca2+ entry and mobilization from InsP3-sensitive, ryanodine-sensitive and mitochondrial stores and to the subsequent activation of CaMKII.", 
    "140": "Adenoid vegetation is a frequent pathology in children, and adenotomy (AT) is the only method of its treatment. The problem of anesthesia at AT has always remained an acute one: the risk of general anesthesia exceeds manifold the risk of intervention itself. At the same time, the local anesthesia is not always an method, therefore, the authors put the goal to improve it through potentiating. A total of 180 children, aged 3 to 14, were divided into several groups; anesthesia at AT was implemented according to the below described methods and with regard for the age-related doses of preparations: Group 1--a 2% lydocain solution administered endonasally (e/n); Group 2--lydocain plus diazepam solution administered e/n; Group 3--same preparations and 50% metamizol solution administered e/n; Group 4--lydocain, metamizol e/n, and diazepam administered transbuccally, i.e. chewing gum; Group 5--a 4% articain solution and metamizol e/n plus diazepam administered transbuccally; Group 6--the same technique after a preliminary administration of lydocain; Group 7--clonidine, administered transbuccally, was added. The adequacy of anesthesia was evaluated by using the parameters of the vegetative nervous system and hemodynamics. It was demonstrated that the administration of lydocain alone leads to a sharp activation of the sympathoadrenal system; metamizol and diazepam, especially when administered transbuccally, contribute to an enhanced efficiency of anesthesia, while the endonasal administration of articain and metamizol, after a preliminary introduction of lydocain, combined with the transbuccal administration of diazepam and clonidine is the most optimal variant, however, this method can not be acknowledged as an ideal one and needs further improvement.",

    "145": "The results demonstrate that swim stress inhibits, by an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor unrelated mechanism, 5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated head twitch behaviour in mice, suggesting that this effect and the swim stress-induced anticonvulsant effect are produced by two separate and independent mechanisms.", 
    "146": "UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B17 is one of the most important conjugating enzymes in androgen metabolism and shares more than 95% homology with UGT2B15. Although UGT2B15 has been fully characterized for its ability to conjugate drugs, environmental pollutants, and dietary components, UGT2B17 received less attention for its capacity to glucuronidate xenobiotics. In the present study, more than 55 exogenous compounds belonging to several categories of compounds were analyzed as potential substrates for UGT2B17. Glucuronidation activity was observed with several coumarins, anthraquinones, and flavonoids. The higher glucuronidation activity was measured with alizarin (125 pmol x min(-1) x mg protein(-1)), whereas UGT2B17 conjugated eugenol, scopoletin, and galangin with glucuronidation rates of 102.5, 102, and 58 pmol x min(-1) x mg protein(-1), respectively. The characterization of UGT2B17 as a xenobiotics-conjugating enzyme demonstrates that its role is not limited to androgen metabolism and that its specificity for exogenous substrates is different from other UGT2B isoforms. Taken together, these data suggest a role of UGT2B17 for the hepatic detoxification.", 
    "147": "We investigated hepatic in vitro intrinsic clearance (CL(int,in vitro)) in freshly isolated or cryopreserved hepatocytes and compared with CL(int,in vivo) by using nine model compounds, FK1052, FK480, diazepam, diltiazem, troglitazone, quinotolast, FK079, zidovudine, and acetaminophen, in rats and humans. The compounds showed a broad range of in vivo hepatic extraction ratios (rat, 0.05-0.93; humans, 0.03-0.76) and were metabolized by hepatic P450, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, sulfotransferase, and/or esterase. CL(int,in vitro) was determined from substrate disappearance rate at 1 microM in hepatocytes. CL(int,in vivo) was calculated from in vivo pharmacokinetic data using two frequently used mathematical models (the well stirred and dispersion models). When estimating rat CL(int,in vitro) in freshly isolated hepatocytes, the rat scaling factor values (CL(int,in vivo)/CL(int,in vitro)) showed marked difference among the model compounds (0.2-73.1-fold). The rat CL(int,in vitro) values in freshly isolated hepatocytes were in good agreement with these in cryopreserved hepatocytes. Human CL(int,in vitro) were determined by use of cryopreserved hepatocytes. When human CL(int,in vitro) was regarded as the predicted CL(int,in vivo), the observed and predicted CL(int,in vivo) for FK1052, FK480, troglitazone, and FK079 differed markedly (12.4-199.0-fold). In contrast, using human CL(int,in vitro) corrected with the rat scaling factors yielded better predictions of CL(int,in vivo) that were mostly within 5-fold of the actual values. These results make the evaluation using hepatocytes more useful and provide a basis for predicting hepatic clearance using hepatocytes.", 
    "148": "Human cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is the most abundant hepatic and intestinal phase I drug-metabolizing enzyme, and participates in the oxidative metabolism of approximately 50% of drugs on the market. In the present study, a transgenic-CYP3A4 (Tg-CYP3A4) mouse model that expresses CYP3A4 in the intestine and is phenotypically normal was generated, which was genotyped by both polymerase chain reaction and Southern blotting. Intestinal microsomes prepared from Tg-CYP3A4 mice metabolized midazolam (MDZ) to 1'-hydroxymidazolam about 2 times, and to 4-hydroxymidazolam around 3 times faster than that from wild-type (WT) mice. These increased MDZ hydroxylation activities were completely inhibited by an anti-CYP3A4 monoclonal antibody. The time course of plasma MDZ and its metabolite concentrations was measured after intravenous (0.25 mg/kg) and oral (2.5 mg/kg) administration of MDZ, and pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by fitting to a noncompartmental model. Pretreatment with ketoconazole increased orally dosed MDZ maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), time of the maximum concentration, area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity (AUC(0- infinity)), and elimination half-life (t(1/2)) to 3.2-, 1.7-, 7.7-, 2-fold, and decreased MDZ apparent oral clearance about 8-fold in Tg-CYP3A4 mice. The ratios of MDZ C(max), AUC(0- infinity), t(1/2) and bioavailability between Tg-CYP3A4 and WT mice after the oral dose of MDZ were 0.3, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.5, respectively. These results suggest that this Tg-CYP3A4 mouse would be an appropriate in vivo animal model for the evaluation of human intestine CYP3A4 metabolism of drug candidates and potential food-drug and drug-drug interactions in preclinical drug development.", 
    "149": "Siberian ginseng ([SG]; Eleutherococcus senticosus) is a commonly used herbal preparation. The objective of this study was to assess in normal volunteers (n = 12) the influence of a standardized SG extract on the activity of cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 and 3A4. Probe substrates dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 activity) and alprazolam (CYP3A4 activity) were administered orally at baseline and again following treatment with SG (1 x 485 mg twice daily) for 14 days. Urinary concentrations of dextromethorphan and dextorphan were quantified, and dextromethorphan metabolic ratios (DMRs) were determined at baseline and after SG treatment. Likewise, plasma samples were collected (0-60 h) for alprazolam pharmacokinetics at baseline and after SG treatment to assess effects on CYP3A4 activity. Validated high performance liquid chromatography methods were used to quantify all compounds and relevant metabolites. There were no statistically significant differences between pre- and post-SG treatment DMRs indicating a lack of effect on CYP2D6 (P > 0.05). For alprazolam there also were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters determined by noncompartmental modeling (C(max), T(max), area under the curve, half-life of elimination) indicating that SG does not significantly induce or inhibit CYP3A4 (P > 0.05). Our results indicate that standardized extracts of SG at generally recommended doses for over-the-counter use are unlikely to alter the disposition of coadministered medications primarily dependent on the CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 pathways for elimination.", 
    "150": "The impact of binge-like, early postnatal ethanol treatment on AMPA or kainate whole cell currents was examined in acutely isolated medial septum/diagonal band (MS/DB) neurons. AMPA (10 or 100 microM) current was inhibited by GYKI 52466, a selective AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist, in all neurons isolated on postnatal day (PD) 5-8, PD 12-15 or PD 32-35. Cyclothiazide, a selective inhibitor of AMPAR desensitization, also effectively potentiated AMPA currents. This suggests that non-NMDA, ionotropic glutamate receptors on immature MS/DB neuron are predominantly AMPARs. Concentration-dependent kainate (10-1000 microM) application evoked nondesensitizing currents that exhibited an increase in the maximum response by the end of first postnatal month, consistent with developmental regulation of AMPAR function. Acute 3 s ethanol application (100 mM) consistently blunted AMPA- and kainate currents approximately 20-30% across age groups. Inhibition was sustained during continuous ethanol superfusion lasting 10-12 min without evidence of acute tolerance. Repeated oral intubation of rat pups with ethanol (5.25 g/kg/day on PD 4-9), which models third trimester human binge drinking, resulted in peak blood ethanol levels of approximately 350 mg/dl (measured 90 min after PD 6 dosing). AMPA or kainate currents were upregulated in neurons isolated on PD 32-35 by earlier ethanol intubation suggesting that binge-like intoxication augments developing AMPAR function. Despite this augmentation of AMPAR function, no significant changes were found in the sensitivity of AMPA currents to GYKI 52466, cyclothiazide or acute ethanol (100 mM) sensitivity or in the levels of GluR1/GluR2 subunit proteins from MS/DB tissue. These results indicate that non-NMDA ionotrophic glutamate receptors on immature MS/DB neurons, which are largely of the AMPAR subtype, are moderately sensitive to immediate inhibition by ethanol. Repeating this inhibition during early postnatal binge-like intoxication can augment normal development of AMPAR function.", 
    "151": "We compared the binding properties of selective muscarinic antagonists with their potencies for antagonizing muscarinic responses in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing M(2) and M(3) muscarinic receptors in combination and in isolation. When measured by the competitive displacement of [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding to CHO cells expressing both M(2) and M(3) muscarinic receptors (CHO M(2)+M(3) cells), the competition curves of the subtype-selective muscarinic antagonists were consistent with a two-site model. One site exhibited binding properties identical to those of CHO M(2) cells, whereas the other site exhibited properties like those of CHO M(3) cells. Oxotremorine-M, a muscarinic agonist, elicited a robust, pertussis toxin-insensitive stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in both CHO M(3) and CHO M(2)+M(3) cells, but not in CHO M(2) cells. The pharmacological antagonism of the phosphoinositide response exhibited similar properties in both CHO M(3) and CHO M(2)+M(3) cells. Oxotremorine-M elicited a pertussis toxin-sensitive, robust inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in both CHO M(2) and CHO M(2)+M(3) cells and a less robust inhibition in CHO M(3) cells. At higher concentrations, oxotremorine-M elicited an increase in cAMP accumulation over the maximal inhibition noted at lower concentrations in both CHO M(3) and CHO M(2)+M(3) cells. Following pertussis toxin treatment, only the stimulatory phase of the cAMP response to oxotremorine-M was observed in CHO M(2), CHO M(3), and CHO M(2)+M(3) cells. The pharmacological antagonism of the cAMP response in CHO M(2)+M(3) cells resembled that expected for a response mediated independently by both M(2) and M(3) receptors.", 
    "152": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic mechanisms of the novel antiepileptic drug, levetiracetam (Keppra), have been both favored and rejected. Since paired-pulse interaction is accepted in functionally assessing GABAergic mechanisms, we investigated whether levetiracetam affects the paired-pulse inhibition/facilitation of the field potentials, evoked in the dentate gyrus of urethane-anesthesized rats. This model revealed a strong paired-pulse inhibition at 20-ms interstimulus interval, a noteworthy paired-pulse facilitation at 80-ms interstimulus interval, and a moderate paired-pulse inhibition at 500-ms interstimulus interval. Bicuculline (3 mg/kg/h, i.v.) and baclofen (10 mg/kg, i.v.) markedly depressed paired-pulse inhibition at 20-ms interstimulus interval, while clonazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.), diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.v.), and phenobarbital (40 mg/kg, i.v.) enhanced it. Bicuculline also depressed paired-pulse inhibition at 500-ms interstimulus interval. Bicuculline, baclofen, and diazepam reduced paired-pulse facilitation at 80-ms interstimulus interval. Distinct from these GABA(A) receptor- and GABA(B) receptor-related drugs, levetiracetam (17 and 540 mg/kg, i.v.) had no significant effect on either paired-pulse interaction in this model, a result not favoring any major role of GABAergic mechanisms in its antiseizure action.",

The frequency of vitamin K antagonist interactions was 0.09 per million packages for omeprazole and 0.11 per million packages for lansoprazole and pantoprazole. Interactions with benzodiazepines or phenytoin were even rarer, being reported in less than 10 patients on each proton pump inhibitor.", 
    "157": "The frequency of reported drug interactions was low for omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole and vitamin K antagonist interactions were by far the most common. These potentially important drug interactions, although rare, were no less frequent on pantoprazole than on omeprazole or lansoprazole, suggesting a class effect.", 
    "158": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an 18 kDa high-affinity drug ligand and cholesterol binding protein involved in various cell functions. Antisera for distinct PBR areas identified immunoreactive proteins of 18, 40, and 56 kDa and occasionally 72, 90, and 110 kDa in testicular Leydig and breast cancer cells. These sizes may correspond to PBR polymers and correlated to the levels of reactive oxygen species. Treatment of Leydig cells with human chorionic gonadotropin rapidly induced free radical, PBR polymer, and steroid formation. UV photoirradiation generates ROS species, which increased the size of intramembraneous particles of recombinant PBR reconstituted into proteoliposomes consistent with polymer formation, determined both by SDS-PAGE and by freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Spectroscopic analysis revealed the formation of dityrosines as the covalent cross-linker between PBR monomers. Moreover, photoirradiation increased PK 11195 drug ligand binding and reduced cholesterol binding capacity of proteoliposomes. Further addition of PK 11195 drug ligand to polymers increased the rate of cholesterol binding. These data indicate that reactive oxygen species induce in vivo and in vitro the formation of covalent PBR polymers. We propose that the PBR polymer might be the functional unit responsible for ligand-activated cholesterol binding and that PBR polymerization is a dynamic process modulating the function of this receptor in cholesterol transport and other cell-specific PBR-mediated functions.",

She also had severe metabolic acidosis. Although initial liver function tests were normal, they were found to be moderately high on the fifth day of admission; however, they dropped to their normal ranges on the twelfth day of admission. Initially, the patient was diagnosed as having idiopathic status epilepticus, and classic anticonvulsant agents, including diazepam, phenytoin, and then phenobarbital, were given. However, her seizures did not subside, and diazepam infusion was initiated. After initiation of diazepam infusion, the seizures were completely controlled. On the fourth day of admission, her parents said that she had accidentally received 20 tablets (a total dose of 2000 mg) of isoniazid just before admission to our hospital. Later, we injected 200 mg of pyridoxine intravenously. During follow-up, her general condition improved, and anticonvulsant agents were discontinued because an electroencephalogram was found to be norma. She was discharged from the hospital on the twelfth day of admission. At the fourth month of follow-up, she was seizure free. Because of this case, we would like to re-emphasize that acute isoniazid poisoning should also be considered in a child with unexplained status epilepticus.",

We report the identification of the human PAP7 gene, its expression pattern, genomic structure, and chromosomal mapping to 1q32-1q41. Human PAP7 is a 60-kDa protein highly homologous to the rodent protein. PAP7 is widely present in human tissues and highly expressed in seminal vesicles, pituitary, thyroid, pancreas, renal cortex, enteric epithelium, muscles, myocardium and in steroidogenic tissues, including the gonads and adrenal cortex. These tissues are also targets of Carney complex (CNC), a multiple neoplasia syndrome caused by germline inactivating PRKAR1A mutations (PRKAR1A-mut) and associated with primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) and increased steroid synthesis. PAP7 and PRKAR1A expression were studied in PPNAD and in lymphoblasts from patients bearing PRKAR1A-mut. Like PRKAR1A, PAP7 was decreased in CNC lymphocytes and PPNAD nodules, but not in the surrounding cortex. These studies showed that, like in the mouse, human PAP7 is highly expressed in steroidogenic tissues, where it follows the pattern of PRKAR1A expression, suggesting that it participates in PRKAR1A-mediated tumorigenesis and hypercortisolism.", 
    "167": "The effects of the cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19 genotype and cigarette smoking on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of estazolam were studied in 16 healthy male volunteers. The two mutated alleles (CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3) causing absent CYP2C19 activity were identified by PCR-based restriction enzyme analysis. Five subjects had no mutated allele, five had one mutated allele, and six had two mutated alleles. Seven subjects were smokers, and nine were nonsmokers. The subjects received a single oral 4-mg dose of estazolam, and blood samplings and evaluation of psychomotor function were conducted up to 72 h after dosing. There was no significant difference among the groups with no, one, and two mutated alleles for the peak plasma concentration (145.2+/-36.5 vs. 142.1+/-33.6 vs. 113.2+/-29.7 ng/ml), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (0- infinity ) (4916.0+/-1276.4 vs. 4389.6+/-736.1 vs. 4047.3+/-613.8 ng x h/ml), apparent oral clearance (0.22+/-0.05 vs. 0.25+/-0.03 vs. 0.25+/-0.03 ml/min/kg), and elimination half-life (24.4+/-4.6 vs. 29.6+/-8.5 vs. 30.7+/-3.9 h). Similarly, none of the pharmacokinetic parameters was significantly different between the nonsmoker and smoker groups. Neither the number of mutated allele nor cigarette smoking affected the psychomotor function parameters significantly. The present study suggests that neither the CYP2C19 genotype nor cigarette smoking affects the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of estazolam.",

The present study is aimed at investigating the influence of olanzapine on the immune cell parameters by comparing these before and in the third month of olanzapine treatment in patients of schizophrenia. Twenty patients who were diagnosed as schizophrenic depending on the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria were included in the study. The immune parameters of patients were compared by measuring them before the treatment and 3 months after treatment. Immune parameters were analyzed by using flow-cytometry equipment labeled Coulter Epics Elite ESP. The positivity of cell-surface antibody was evaluated as percentage. The rates of CD8 in the third month of the treatment were considerably increased relative to pretreatment. Furthermore, rates of CD4/CD8 were significantly decreased in the third month of the treatment relative to before treatment.

Eighty-nine (56.3%) of these patients were assigned to the olanzapine treatment group (OLZ) and 69 (43.7%) to the control group that received treatment with conventional antipsychotics (CON). Safety was evaluated in terms of the spontaneous adverse events reported and a specific questionnaire for extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Clinical status was measured by means of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S).

    "178": "There is a vast literature examining the neurochemical effects of anxiolytics throughout the rat brain; however, although the behavioural actions of anxiolytic drugs are routinely assessed in animal models of anxiety, the majority of neurochemical studies have been performed in rats with relatively 'normal' behavioural phenotypes. Since there is significant evidence that an anxious phenotype is associated with numerous neurochemical alterations, it is feasible that the central effects of anxiolytics may vary depending on the underlying behavioural state (and corresponding neuropathology) of the experimental animal. For this reason, the aim of the present study was to examine the effect of chronic anxiolytic drug administration on the central CCK and dopamine systems in anxious (isolated from weaning) and nonanxious (group-housed) Fawn-Hooded (FH) rats. It is important to note that these studies were performed in rats with continued access to ethanol, which may affect the responses to anxiolytic treatment. Chronic anxiolytic treatment with the selective CCK-B (CCK(2)) receptor antagonist, Ci-988 (0.3 mg/kg/day ip) or diazepam (2 mg/kg/day ip), induced numerous effects throughout the central nervous system (CNS), with Ci-988 inducing significant changes in the density of dopamine D(2) receptors, and diazepam producing marked changes in both dopamine D(2) and CCK-B receptor binding density as well as preproCCK mRNA expression. Interestingly, the neurochemical effects of these anxiolytic drugs varied significantly depending on the rearing conditions of the rats, demonstrating the importance of using adequate animal models when correlating the behavioural and central effects of drugs acting throughout the CNS.",

Guinea pigs, previously implanted with cortical electrodes for EEG recording, were pretreated with pyridostigmine bromide (0.026 mg/kg im) 30 min prior to challenge with 2x LD50 dose (sc) of a given nerve agent; in a separate experiment, animals were challenged with 5x LD50 sc of soman. One minute after agent challenge the animals were treated im with 2 mg/kg atropine SO(4) admixed with 25 mg/kg 2-PAM Cl. Five minutes after the start of EEG seizures, animals were treated im with different doses of anticholinergics or benzodiazepines and observed for seizure termination. The time to seizure onset, the time to seizure termination, and 24-h lethality were recorded. The anticonvulsant ED50 of each drug for termination of seizures induced by each agent was calculated and compared. Brain tissue from animals that survived 24 h was examined for pathology. All drugs were capable of terminating seizure activity, with midazolam and trihexyphenidyl being significantly more potent than the other drugs, and midazolam being more rapid in controlling seizure than atropine, trihexyphenidyl, or diazepam against each agent. Seizures induced by sarin or VX required lower doses of all the test anticonvulsants. The dose of a given drug that was an effective anticonvulsant against a 2x LD50 challenge of soman was equally effective against seizures induced by a 5x LD50 challenge. All nerve agents were capable of producing neuropathology. Seizure control was strongly associated with protection against acute lethality and brain pathology."
