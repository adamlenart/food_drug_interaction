    "0": "BZD may have some temporary palliative value in reducing anxiety over the short-term, but have not yet been shown to be of lasting value for neuroses either on their own or with any form of psychotherapy. When the drug is withdrawn, at best the effects do not persist and at worst there are severe side effects after withdrawal. 3 controlled studies of diazepam have been completed in phobics having exposure. In two of these there was a slight temporary gain when diazepam was combined with exposure, but the only study to have followup found that this gain dissipated within a month. Uncontrolled evidence suggests that high doses of BZD might actually impede improvement during exposure treatment of phobics . In contrast, exposure treatment is enduringly effective and can often be self-administered with minimum guidance from the therapist.", 
    "1": "The neurochemical changes underlying the convulsant effects of Lindane, an organochlorinated insecticide, are not known. Since electrophysiological and pharmacological data suggest the view that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays an important role in controlling convulsive seizures, the effect of lindane on the GABAergic system, on different areas of the rat brain, has been evaluated. Lindane (100 mg/kg i.p.) induces a selective increase of GABA levels in the cerebellum after the onset of seizures. Non-significant increases were observed in the cortex and hippocampus. GABA turnover, as measured by the accumulation rate of GABA after blockade of its catabolism, was increased in all the brain areas examined. On the other hand, lindane does not significantly displace from their binding sites in vitro either 3H-GABA or 3H-Flunitrazepam. These findings show that convulsions elicited by lindane are not due to an impairment of the GABAergic system. Moreover, an increase of GABA functional activity takes place, in all brain areas examined, probably as a protective mechanism to counteract the seizures.", 
    "2": "Cats underwent treatment with chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (0.4, 10.0, and 20.0 mg/kg per os), for 7 consecutive days, and were killed 18 h after the last administration. The endogenous levels of serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), noradrenaline (NA), and dopamine (DA) were assayed in 12 brain areas. Few effects on 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and NA content and on the 5-HT:5-HIAA ratio were observed with a 0.4 mg/kg treatment. These changes were localized in the piriform lobe (amygdala), hippocampus, mesencephalon, and mesencephalon raphe nuclei. Moreover, the DA concentration was not affected. The changes produced by 10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide treatments were extended to many more structures, including the limbic system, brainstem, diencephalon, and neostriatum with respect to 5-HT, 5-HIAA, and NA content and also to DA levels. The changes observed after the three doses generally included an increased 5-HT content, a decreased 5-HIAA level, a high 5-HT:5-HIAA ratio, and increased NA and DA concentrations. However, in some structures, a decreased NA content and an increased 5-HIAA level were found. The present results suggest that administration of chlordiazepoxide for 7 consecutive days in cats produces regional changes in the content of endogenous biogenic amines in the central nervous system (CNS) at low doses; much more extended effects are produced at high doses. These findings are in agreement with a reducing effect of benzodiazepines on the turnover and release of biogenic amines in the CNS, but also suggest that certain discrete areas are more involved in these changes, thus dissociating them from the rest of the brain.", 
    "3": "Methylxanthines can produce behavior resembling opiate withdrawal in rats. Since previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of central noradrenergic systems during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal, the effects of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) on norepinephrine metabolism in rat brain were studied. It was found that administration of IBMX elevated levels of the major norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in areas innervated by the locus coeruleus. The increases in MHPG was noted 1 h after administration and was maximal (270% of control) after 3 h. Levels of another norepinephrine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol, followed a similar pattern and time course. Coadministration of naloxone with IBMX did not affect the IBMX-induced elevation in MHPG. Administration of the alpha-agonist clonidine, however, antagonized the effects of IBMX on MHPG levels. The effects of IBMX and clonidine were dose dependent; the lowest dose of IBMX needed to elevate MHPG was 30 mumol/kg (i.p.), and clonidine (180 nmol/kg) reduced the effect of IBMX (100 mumol/kg) by 50%. The data, discussed in terms of a methylxanthine-noradrenergic interaction, suggest that withdrawal behaviors in general may be subserved by hyperactive noradrenergic neurons.", 
    "4": "The stability of benzodiazepines in blood and tissues was examined in this study. Specifically, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam, and their desalkyl metabolites were studied over several months. Diazepam, flurazepam, and N-1-desalkylflurazepam were stable when stored in blood at room temperature while chlordiazepoxide, norchlordiazepoxide, and nordiazepam were found to be unstable under similar storage conditions. Data from tissues containing these chemicals corroborated the results from blood.", 
    "5": "The kinetics of pinazepam were studied in six healthy male volunteers aged between 26 and 31 years. The drug was administered in a single oral dose (10 mg). The concentrations of the parent compound and metabolites were measured in the plasma and urine by gas-chromatographic analysis. Plasma levels of pinazepam were fitted to a two-compartment open model with first order absorption rate using a three-exponential equation. Absorption rate constant and peak plasma levels of pinazepam were 1.36 +/- 0.15 h-1 and 36.8 +/- 5.1 ng/ml respectively. Plasma decay of the drug consisted of an initial rapid elimination phase (alpha = 0.46 +/- 0.06 h-1) followed by a slow one (beta = 0.046 +/- 0.004 h-1). N-desmethyldiazepam was the only metabolite detected in the plasma. Its plasma concentrations were higher than those of the parent compound shortly after administration. Urine was collected for 72 h after dosing. Those specimens contained unconjugate pinazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam and glucuronated oxazepam and 3-OH-pinazepam. Only 0.016% of the pinazepam administered was recovered as unchanged compound in the urine.", 
    "6": "In both general practice and psychiatry, the indication for benzodiazepines recognized by the French Technical Commissions--\"all forms of anxiety\"--remains very broad, and absolute contraindications are limited to severe respiratory insufficiency and, for certain drugs, myasthenia. Responsibility for deciding at what moment it becomes necessary to prescribe benzodiazepines therapy lies with the individual doctor--he is sole judge in his relationship with the patient: reactional anxiety, anxiety or distress accompanying somatic disease, insomnia. Benzodiazepines should not be prescribed to children, unless there are exceptional reasons for doing so. In psychiatry, higher doses are authorized for neurotic or psychotic anxiety, which are considered to be more serious forms. It is more or less accepted practice to prescribe benzodiazepines in combination therapy of various kinds with other psychotropic drugs. There are certain indications for which benzodiazepines in monotherapy are wrongly used, such as depressive states, and others where their use is contested, schizophrenic states, for example. Pharmacokinetic data are now beginning to provide a guide to dosage scheduling and to the choice of drug for the different indications. Maximum duration of benzodiazepine therapy should not exceed 4 months in certain cases. Risk of withdrawal syndrome appears to be slight for usual therapeutic doses. Finally, benzodiazepines are not the first choice of the drug addicts.", 
    "7": "Benzodiazepines (BZD) are lipophilic molecules, undissociated agents which easily penetrate membranes. Pharmacokinetics of BZD arises from these chemico-physical properties. Thus BZD show a rapid placental transfer with significant uptake of the drug, in both early and late pregnancy. The changes in the placental structures and in the circulation of the uterus during pregnancy are responsible in the greater placental passage in late pregnancy. After repeated doses in pregnant women, BZD tend to accumulate on the fetus, and the \" flappy infant\" syndrome may occur. The disposition of diazepam in women to the end of the pregnancy is altered. The terminal half-life is about twice as in non pregnant control, the distribution volume is increased but the total plasma clearance is not changed. In neonate child and particularly in premature infant, elimination of the BZD is slower in relation with immaturity of the hepatic enzymes systems metabolising drugs. BZD appear in human milk, but only high clinical doses might be expected to exert an effect on the nursing newborn. In the first trimester of pregnancy use of BZD has to be exceptional; the safety of these products in early pregnancy has not yet been definitively established. In the late pregnancy and at the parturition, there are more clear indications. Generally high single doses and repeated and prolonged administrations have to be avoided.", 
    "8": "The dynamic correlates of the pharmacokinetic profiles of various benzodiazepines used as hypnotics are described using impairment of performance. In particular, rate of absorption and the nature of the distribution phase are discussed, and the way in which the pharmacokinetic profile relates to clinical use.", 
    "9": "About twenty five benzodiazepines are widely used around the world. The compounds differ essentially by the rate and the extent of their appearance in the systemic circulation and their distribution in the body and by the rates and the steps of their metabolism. The duration of action for benzodiazepines have been described using the beta elimination half-lives. However, this parameter is only one of the several factors involved in the drug disappearance during the clinical effect period. But it can provide some informations on the likelihood of accumulation. One question of tremendous importance for the clinical practice remains the amount and the activity of the benzodiazepines metabolites. Extended studies appear crucial for the potential clinical benefits of this class of compounds.", 
    "10": "Drug level at receptor site dictates the intensity of the pharmacological response. The level which is achieved depends upon several factors such as gastrointestinal absorption, protein binding, distribution, biotransformations and excretion. Modification of anyone of these processes can influence drug level at the site of action and thus the therapeutic effect of the drug. Physiological and pathological states or drug interactions can influence pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines and thus modification of dosage regimen may be necessary. The influence of aging, liver disease, drug interactions such as alcohol, antidepressants... is of importance. Consequences of these modifications are discussed.", 
    "11": "After ingestion of equal doses of a given benzodiazepine serum concentrations vary greatly from one individual to another, suggesting that it may be advisable to monitor circulating drug levels. But so far, few studies have been conducted on the relation between benzodiazepine serum concentrations and clinical results. In general, these studies conclude that there is no significant relation between circulating drug levels and anxiolytic activity. On the other hand, the kinetic properties of benzodiazepines determine the type, rapidity of onset and duration of action of each drug. Onset of action depends on the speed of absorption of the product, and duration of action depends on how widely it is diffused. After administration of repeated doses of a benzodiazepine, accumulation of the drug depends on its half-life of elimination and metabolic clearance. Finally, the side-effects of benzodiazepines are often related to their concentrations in the plasma, but in cases of massive intoxication, there is often a dissociation between drug serum levels and the clinical picture.", 
    "12": "Obsessive-- Compulsives complaints have shown good and sometimes marked improvements, since behaviour therapists have established principles of treatment for those psychological problems, i.e.: exposure to evoked stimuli and response prevention of rituals or avoidance behaviours. Pharmacological and behavioral treatments may be associated with success. It seems that the purpose of future research and investigation will be to focalise on the respective place and role of psychotropic drugs (antidepressive and BZD) in association with cognitive behaviour modifications.", 
    "13": "The somatic manifestations of anxiety are to distinguish from distress accompanying from distress accompanying the course of severe somatic diseases; they are evoked as are their peculiar clonical aspects in the neurotic, psychosomatic and psychotic register. The methods of their treatment are recalled in two chapters: the therapeutic means - drug therapy and psychotherapy - and the therapeutic strategy. It always passes by an etiologic approach of anxiety, the elucidation of the sense in the patient's history. The doctor-patient relationship is an important determinant in the treatment.", 
    "14": "It has been recently hypothesized that anxiety is heterogeneous. Generalized anxiety and panic disorders could be separate entities with specific treatments, as suggested by the fact that some clinical forms of anxiety can be distinguished by characteristic therapeutic responses. The generalized anxiety treatments include benzodiazepines, verbal psychotherapy and relaxation training; they are non mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, at the present time no rational criteria allow to select the best treatment for a particular patient.", 
    "15": "The authors analyse the principal works of the literature, essentially controlled studies, about the efficacy of benzodiazepines in schizophrenic psychosis. The disparity of methods and results doesn't allow to confirm or not the antipsychotic efficacy of benzodiazepines. At the end of a study of six cases, the authors converge on the same conclusions and note an excellent tolerance of Diazepam prescribed with a posology of 300 to 500 mg a day.", 
    "16": "The double-blind controlled trials between benzodiazepines and antidepressants show that benzodiazepines have not specific antidepressive action in depression. The benzodiazepines exert limited effect on the anxiety of endogenous and melancholia. They have definitive properties in neurotic depressions and mixed anxious-depressive states. In theses states, they may extenuate inhibition and elevate mood. Benzodiazepines are primarily anxiolytic rather than antidepressant -- But in some cases, anxiety and depression are not easily distinguished.", 
    "17": "Diazepam, clorazepate and flunitrazepam are used to premedicate , to anesthetize and after the intervention. Anxiolysis , sedation, hypnosis, muscle relaxation, amnesia and seizure prevention justified their employment. They have few side effects. Anesthesiologist just have to be careful of their long-acting effects as for ambulatory anaesthesia.", 
    "18": "The advantages of a once a day regime of a long half life benzodiazepine are illustrated by a general pratitioner study in the U.K., which showed that in a group of over 100 patients, clorazepate 15 mg nocte was equally as effective as diazepam 5 mg three times a day. Another study carried out on 50 patients randomly allocated to lorazepam 1 mg t.d.s. or to clorazepate, which was directly related to the low incidence of side effects and simplicity of dosage.", 
    "19": "If the differential specific anxiolytic activity between various benzodiazepines remains controverted , the clinician nevertheless now possesses scientific data allowing him to make a more rational selection, in order to obtain a better overall efficacy, either for an anxiolytic or hypnotic action. In other respects, the concept of anxiety has evolved and given rise to distinctions that will need to be taken into account in the choice of the adequate psychotropic medication, either a benzodiazepine or another psychotropic drug. When a benzodiazepine must be prescribed, the main criteria involved in its choice need to be considered. As anxiolytic medication, besides a selective action on anxiety, the absence of cumbersome effect on psychomotor activity and vigilance, pharmacokinetics constitute an important factor that must be looked at. Although the classification of benzodiazepines according to their half-life is only an approximation, some overlapping being possible between the various groups, it proves nevertheless extremely useful with respect to the therapeutic goal considered and the various clinical parameters involved. Some other aspects must also be considered, for example the rebound phenomenon. Finally, the variability of individual responses to drug treatment must be remembered.", 
    "20": "Placebo effect should be taken into account when therapeutic results are being assessed. This is especially important for anxiety-relief. Two main mechanisms are considered to account for placebo effect: suggestion and conditioning. Interpretation of results is rendered particularly difficult by the lack of precise information about anxiety and anxiety-relief.", 
    "21": "We examined successively the different possible approaches to pathological anxiety. In clinical practice, it is easy to distinguish, in qualitative and quantitative terms, between neurotic and psychotic anxiety, the difference being obvious to any practising psychiatrist. A psychopathological approach, however, raises some doubt as to whether the answer is so obvious, and leads us to pose two questions: 1) Is it still possible to have a unitary conception of pathological anxiety, commonly considered as a central element to all forms of psychopathological expression? 2) Since anxiety is an emotion which can be felt by any normal as well as pathological individual, should we consider anxiety to be different when it is expressed in different states - neurosis, psychosis or even border states - by different types of symbolization , depending on the organization of the state? The present advances in pharmacoclinical research, using pharmacological agents as modifying agents for behaviour patterns with specific action mechanisms, enable us to carry the debate further by distinguishing clinical phenomena and neurobiological effector mechanisms. It also shows that within the various established clinical types, several pathological syndromes may be involved, each having different symptoms and its own distinct evolution, and requiring different, more specific treatment. This leads us to rethink the classical distinctions, to refine our semiology, and to familiarize ourselves with the use of chemotherapy, particularly as a \"behaviour analyzer\", able to teach us something about the different types of anxious behaviour and about the neurobiological mechanisms which are specifically modified by these pharmacological agents.", 
    "22": "Some clinical studies are available showing that benzodiazepine drugs are essentially devoid of major neuroendocrine effects, at least at anxiolytic doses. Moreover, sedative doses are necessary to evidence in laboratory animals an increased secretion of corticosteroids, a reduced activation of the adrenocortical axis by stress and an inhibition of prolactin secretion. In fact, the neuroendocrinology of anxiety and the neuroendocrine effects of benzodiazepines in the anxious subject are hardly known.", 
    "23": "The discovery of the role of neuropeptides in information processing within the central nervous system has brought a new dimension in the research for biological basis of affective disorders and mental diseases. Various peptides with a high binding affinity for benzodiazepine receptors have been isolated but none of them can be considered as a true endogenous ligand. Various peptides present agonist or antagonist activities in different pharmacological tests for anxiolytic activity but their main effects are different. Naloxone is able to antagonize several effects of benzodiazepines in animals and humans, which suggests that endorphins are involved in anxiolytic properties of these drugs. Neuropeptides may have anxiogenic or anxiolytic-like action related to the neuroendocrine modulation of acquisition and retention of adaptive behaviours in stress situations. In addition neuropeptides such as alpha-MSH, bombesin and mainly CRF may regulate neurohormonal responses to stress. Finally evidence is presented to suggest that neuropeptides may be involved in the critical stages of emotional development, to allow associations between visceral changes and inner representation of significant environmental stimuli. The modulation by ACTH peptides of the imprinting process in birds is an example of such a possibility.", 
    "24": "Various behavioral models aiming at creating and studying anxiety in animals are reviewed in this study. Much emphasis is given to procedures where blockade (partial or total) of ongoing behavior is produced by aversive events such as punishment, non-reward (frustration) or novelty of the situation to which the animal is faced. Were analysed methodological characteristics that appeared particularly pertinent, and the respective limitation of each procedure. The effects of anxiolytic compounds (more often the benzodiazepines) thereon were interpreted.", 
    "25": "From psychopharmacological experiments the concept of a \"behavioural inhibition system\" (BIS) has been developed. This system responds to novel stimuli or to those associated with punishment or nonreward by inhibiting ongoing behaviour and increasing arousal and attention to the environment. It is activity in the BIS that constitutes anxiety and that is reduced by anti-anxiety drugs (benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol). The effects of the anti-anxiety drugs in the brain suggest hypotheses concerning the neural substrate of anxiety. Although the benzodiazepines and barbiturates facilitate the effects of gamma-aminobutyrate, this is insufficient to explain their highly specific behavioural effects. Because of similarities between the behavioural effects of certain lesions and those of the anti-anxiety drugs, it is proposed that these drugs reduce anxiety by impairing the functioning of a widespread neural system including the septo-hippocampal system, the Papez circuit, the prefrontal cortex, and ascending monoaminergic and cholinergic pathways which innervate these forebrain structures. Analysis of the functions of this system suggests that it acts as a comparator: it compares predicted to actual sensory events and activates the outputs of the BIS when there is a mismatch or when the predicted event is aversive. The resulting theory is applied to the symptoms and treatment of anxiety in man.", 
    "26": "Benzodiazepines (BDZ) interact with specific receptors (R), whose activation improves Cl- -channel gating by the GABA receptor (GABA-R). Neurones, whose GABAergic input has a certain level of activity, will be more inhibited in the presence of BDZ (primary target neurones for BDZ). Secondarily, neurones dependent on the activity of primary target neurones will also be effected. Drugs that interact with GABAergic functions (except the BDZ-R) or with the function of primary or secondary target neurones may inhibit some or all BDZ effects; these are nonspecific BDZ antagonists (e.g. GABA-antagonists, cholinesterase inhibitors, naloxone, methylxanthines). Specific BDZ antagonists inhibit the action of BDZ by blocking competitively the BDZ-R. Ro 15-1788 is the best investigated specific BDZ antagonist. Virtually devoid of any pharmacological action by itself, the compound blocks all typical effects of BDZ. It is well tolerated also in man and will find application in anaesthesiology to shorten the sedative and muscle relaxant effect of BDZ and in emergency services to reverse comatose states after BDZ overdosage. Recently drugs have been found that produce effects opposite to the BDZ tranquilizers by inducing a conformation of the BDZ-R which depresses GABA-mediated Cl- -channel gating. The effects of these inverse agonists (e.g. proconvulsant , convulsant, anxiogenic) are blocked by pure competitive BDZ-R blockers, such as Ro 15-1788.", 
    "27": "The discovery, in 1977, of the specific binding sites for benzodiazepines in the brain of mammals, notably in man, lends support to the possible existence of endogenous compounds acting as natural ligands of these sites. At present, a dozen of molecules having the capacity to displace bound 3H-benzodiazepines from their specific sites have been extracted from the brain of several species (rat, pig, bovine...), the cerebrospinal fluid and urine of man. These molecules are proteins, peptides, purines, beta-carbolines... and exhibit (some) pharmacological properties similar or opposite to those of benzodiazepines. The most recent data concerning benzodiazepine receptors suggest that the endogenous ligand would be, if it exists, a benzodiazepine-like compound (agonist) with an indolic structure.", 
    "28": "The benzodiazepines bind to high affinity sites on neuronal membranes in the central nervous system. These sites form part of a multimolecular postsynaptic complex which also includes the GABA receptor and its ionophore. The benzodiazepine binding sites appear to present a certain heterogeneity which may correspond to a diversity of functions. A good correlation exists between the pharmacological potencies of the various benzodiazepines and their affinities for the receptor in vitro, but the relationship is less clear when binding is studied in vivo. Nevertheless, high affinity benzodiazepine binding remains an essential tool for the pharmacologist in search of more specific drugs.", 
    "29": "It is evident, and has been confirmed by epidemiological and experimental data, that ingestion of alcohol can reduce alertness and disturb the concentration of drivers. However, there is still some confusion on this question, since it is impossible to predict what will be the exact level of alcoholemia following ingestion of a given quantity of alcohol, and because disturbances in alertness vary greatly from one individual to another for the same level of alcoholemia . The essential distinction between acute alcoholisation and chronic alcoholisation (due to notions of alcohol tolerance and dependance ) must also be taken into account. Similar difficulties exist in interpreting the relation between ingestion of benzodiazepines and vehicule driving, but they are further complicated by other factors, notably the large number of drugs. Of course, it is possible to show by laboratory experiments, that some benzodiazepines (dipotassium clorazepate, for example) do not disturb the concentration of drivers when given alone, in normal doses and for the recommended indications. But in reality, epidemiological data show that, statistically speaking, drivers taking benzodiazepines have a higher risk of accident than the average drivers. It would appear from this that, for a driver ingesting both alcohol and benzodiazepines, the risk of accident is greatly enhanced. It is also clear that the difficulties in interpreting this risk are multiplied. To summarize very briefly, it appears that there is potentiation when the two substances are ingested together in cases of acute alcoholisation (with an increase in benzodiazepine blood levels), and attenuation in cases of chronic alcoholisation (due to acceleration in clearance provoked by hepatic microsomial induction).", 
    "30": "From a retrospective series of 162 patients hospitalized for an acute intoxication including the taking of benzodiazepine, the different aspects of this intoxication are looked into. This intoxication is, at the present time, the most frequent among those due to drugs, and the benzodiazepine responsible in most cases are oxazepam, chlorazepate and diazepam. When benzodiazepine are taken alone, in most cases, these intoxications are without troubles or responsible for moderate consciousness troubles. Troubles are over all due to associated toxic drugs, without ethanol seeming to increase considerably the seriousness of troubles. Plasmatic dosages of its compounds are difficult to explain and the levels are discordant with the symptomatology. Particularly, some levels, among the highest, are found in patients having no troubles.", 
    "31": "The authors successively mention the long-term treatments with benzodiazepines, prescribed by the general practitioner and by the psychiatrist. In conclusion, they state that the benzodiazepines seldom induce dependence. Then, reviewing the data available in the literature , they describe the clinical features of withdrawal syndrome, the factors with may be prescribe and the rebound phenomena following abrupt cessation of benzodiazepine therapy.", 
    "32": "We observed the alpha-sleep pattern in 6 out of 44 subjects who offered neither somatic nor psychological complaints. All of the 6 subjects demonstrated the pattern consistently over a period of several years. 14 of the polygraphic sleep EEGs were recorded when free of any drugs, 10 after administration of benzodiazepine hypnotics. The alpha-sleep pattern is superimposed on all the regular patterns during any of the different sleep stages, and shows a cyclic representation with an increase correlating to the delta-sleep stages 3 and 4. It can be differentiated from other activities due to its localization, frequency characteristics, occurrence in relation to different sleep stages, and modification under the influence of benzodiazepine hypnotics. In contrast to the sigma-spindle activity, the alpha-sleep pattern is reduced with these drugs. Regarding the functional significance of the alpha-sleep pattern one might consider the possibility that it indicates a partially heightened level of sleep depth.", 
    "33": "The literature on benzodiazepine dependence is reviewed and analysed. Factors that lead to a higher risk of dependence include the duration of treatment, the dosage and dependence on other substances. The risk of dependence during therapeutic use of benzodiazepines is assessed, place in clinical context and methods for reducing withdrawal manifestations described. Social aspects of benzodiazepine use are discussed. An overall conclusion is drawn that the benefits from the use of benzodiazepines within good medical practice far outweigh their problems.", 
    "34": "The rational use of antiepileptic drugs requires the consideration of their pharmacokinetics, which may be influenced by the physiological and pathological factors. Pharmacokinetic interactions between antiepileptic drugs may lead to considerable fluctuation in plasma drug concentration, and monotherapy is often preferable. The absorption of phenytoin depends on pharmaceutical formulation. Phenytoin is highly bound to plasma proteins, thus the changes in the unbound fraction are of clinical significance. The saturation kinetics of its metabolism and drug interactions have further consequences. Carbamazepine is well absorbed and largely metabolized. Due to the autoinduction its half-life shortens in chronic administration. Valproate is highly, but variably bound to plasma proteins. It is eliminated mainly by metabolism. Due to the long half-life of phenobarbital its plasma concentrations change slowly, and time to the steady-state may be up to 30 days, if no loading dose is given. Primidone is partly metabolized to phenobarbital, and at steady-state plasma concentration of phenobarbital often exceeds that of primidone. Diazepam, clonazepam and nitrazepam are largely bound to plasma proteins and extensively metabolized with the half-lives of 20 to 60 hours.", 
    "35": "Various effects of BZ tranquilizers can be attenuated or blocked by a number of non-specific antagonists. These drugs do not interact with specific BZ receptors, but affect various transmitter systems that are primarily or secondarily involved in the effects of benzodiazepines; of interest are agents that interact with GABA synthesis, GABA receptors and chloride channels, cholinergic mechanisms, with endogenous opioids and purines. Such non-specific antagonists are of potential usefulness in identifying neuronal systems that underly the various effects of BZ's. BZ receptor blockers interact with BZ's at their specific receptors. Two fundamentally different types of specific antagonists exist: competitive inhibitors with a negligible agonistic or inverse agonistic component, such as Ro 15-1788 and Ro 15-3505, and inverse agonists, e.g. beta-carboline derivatives which alter the BZ receptor in such a way that effects are produced which are the opposite of those induced by full agonists. The three classes of ligands of the BZ receptor, namely agonists, competitive antagonists and inverse agonists have greatly contributed to the current knowledge of the operation of BZ receptors.", 
    "36": "The benzodiazepine receptor can be considered as a regulatory unit for GABA receptor function. Receptor agonists such as the classical benzodiazepines induce a conformational change of the receptor which results in an enhancement of GABAergic transmission, leading to therapeutically useful effects. Inverse agonists such as several beta-carboline derivatives induce a different conformational change of the receptor resulting in a reduction of GABAergic transmission with concomitant anxiogenic and convulsant effects. Antagonists like Ro 15-1788 largely lack drug efficacy per se but antagonize the action of agonists and inverse agonists by competitive interaction at the receptor. Highly purified benzodiazepine receptor fractions showed properties similar to those in intact neuronal membranes. The receptor fractions contained high affinity binding sites for benzodiazepine agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists which were amenable to modulation by GABA. In addition, high affinity sites for GABA were present. The progress made in the isolation of the GABA receptor complex raises hopes to determine the molecular details of receptor function and of drug efficacy in the near future.", 
    "37": "Both pharmacological and biochemical evidence support the existence of BZ receptor subtypes. Determination of the molecular basis of BZ receptor heterogeneity requires additional research. The physiological significance of BZ receptor subtypes is not currently understood. One hypothesis presented to explain the unique pharmacological effects of CL 218872 suggests that CL 218872 has preferential affinity for a BZ receptor subtype (i.e., type I sites) that mediates the anxiolytic effects of the clinically active BZs. An alternative hypothesis has been proposed to account for these observations and is based upon the possibility that CL 218872 may act as a partial agonist at the BZ receptor. The partial agonist theory is supported by behavioral evidence and the relatively small differences in affinity of the BZ receptor subtypes discriminated by CL 218872 at physiological temperatures. In addition, in vivo binding studies suggest that occupancy of type II BZ receptor subtypes (i.e., those with low affinity for CL 218872) is necessary for CL 218872 to produce minimal anticonflict activity (4). Unlike certain other neurotransmitter systems, it is difficult to correlate the heterogeneous binding properties of BZ receptor ligands with their agonist/antagonist potential at BZ receptor. For example, CL 218872 discriminates BZ receptor subtypes and acts as an agonist at the BZ receptor. Beta-carbolines such as PCC also discriminate receptor subtypes, yet they act as antagonists at the BZ receptor. Compounding the complexity, neither the nature nor the existence of an endogenous ligand is known. So, the designation of agonist or antagonist effects is made on a purely functional basis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "Three benzodiazepine derivatives are currently indicated specifically for the treatment of insomnia in the United States. Flurazepam is biotransformed to at least two rapidly appearing and rapidly eliminated intermediate metabolites which probably contribute to sleep induction. The final metabolite, desalkylflurazepam, appears slowly, but has a long half-life ranging from 40 to 150 h. This metabolite accumulates extensively during multiple dosage. Temazepam is a slowly absorbed drug and has an intermediate half-life in the range of 10-20 h. Triazolam has an intermediate absorption rate, but is rapidly eliminated (half-life 1.5-5 h) making it essentially non-accumulating. Understanding of the pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepine hypnotics can contribute to understanding of their clinical properties.", 
    "39": "Zopiclone (RP 27 267) is an hypnotic with a chemical structure different from that of the benzodiazepines (BZD) or barbiturates. Studies of zopiclone in classical psychopharmacological tests, in comparison with BZD and barbiturates, have shown that it exhibits the five main types of activity considered as characteristic of the pharmacological profile of BZD and partly of that of barbiturates (anticonvulsant, myorelaxant, antiaggressive, sedative-hypnotic and 'anticonflict'). However, like BZD, zopiclone differs from barbiturates by a high safety margin. Electrophysiological studies performed in cats have shown that zopiclone induces modifications in sleep-wakefulness pattern which are close to those observed with BZD, specially with nitrazepam. Moreover, zopiclone increases the threshold for arousal by reticular formation stimulation, rather more than nitrazepam, but with a shorter duration of action. The short duration of action of zopiclone has been demonstrated in other species using different tests.", 
    "40": "We carried out a randomized double-blind study. This was a crossover design with two periods of 2 days each with one compound (either zopiclone or triazolam). The next 2 days of active trial periods the patients were allowed to choose the preferred coloured capsule of which both neither the patients nor the investigators knew about its real contents. 40 volunteers were chosen from our patients suffering from chronic alcoholism who just finished their detoxification. There were given coloured coded capsules, each of them containing either 0.25 mg triazolam or 3.75 mg zopiclone. The capsules should be swallowed when patients felt a desire for alcohol. The maximal dosage was 8 capsules per day (2.0 mg triazolam and 30 mg zopiclone). There was a significant difference of degrees of freedom and probability at a level of 0.0005 for the items of the Addiction Research Centre Inventory and a level of 0.0005 for the items of the 'profile of mood states'. None of the volunteers developed a special desire for zopiclone after withdrawal of the medication.", 
    "41": "The reinforcing properties of zopiclone (3.75 mg) and triazolam (0.25 mg) and their side effects were studied in a double-blind crossover design, followed by forced choice in 40 volunteers taken from a population of chronic alcoholic inpatients who had just completed withdrawal from alcohol. After initial interview when the physician checked if the inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, patients were submitted to the following assessments: profile of mood states (POMS), ARCI subscales (items of scales No. 452, 129, 125, and 52), drug record form and vital signs, SESI (side effect checklist), preference form, subjective effect scale (subscale 220 of the ARCI), and withdrawal assessment. No difference between the drugs could be found on the POMS, ARCI or in the drug intake. There was a difference in patients' drug preference for triazolam in comparison to zopiclone. Zopiclone, like triazolam, may induce some feelings similar to those obtained with alcohol. Side effects noticed by patients were of mild to moderate degree and harmless.", 
    "42": "A double-blind, parallel group, randomized trial was carried out to compare the hypnotic efficacy of 1.0 mg loprazolam and 5.0 mg nitrazepam in 40 elderly patients. All had disturbed sleep patterns, which were not the result of physical illness, and had been shown to be placebo non-responders during a 3-day placebo screening period. Patients received active medication for 7 nights. Both loprazolam and nitrazepam significantly improved sleep patterns, as measured by patient self-rating scales and night nurses' global assessments, in comparison with the placebo baseline screen (p less than 0.001). No significant differences in efficacy were shown between drug treatments and no untoward effects were recorded which could be attributed to either drug. The results suggest that 1.0 mg loprazolam is an effective and well-tolerated hypnotic in elderly patients suffering from insomnia.", 
    "43": "A double-blind study was carried out in 30 hospital out-patients suffering from moderate to severe neurotic anxiety to compare the efficacy and tolerance of alprazolam and placebo. Patients were allocated at random to receive alprazolam, in a dosage of 0.5 to 1 mg 3-times daily, or placebo over a 4-week period. The results of assessments using the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and global impressions of response to treatment by both physician and patients showed alprazolam to be superior to placebo in the relief of symptoms. Side-effects were infrequent: only 3 of the 15 patients in the alprazolam group reported mild or moderate drowsiness.", 
    "44": "The role of various neurotransmitter systems in the brain in extinction behavior is examined. An attempt is made to suggest psychological mechanisms (such as attention, secondary reinforcement or internal inhibition) by which the neurotransmitter systems or drugs act to produce the observed alteration in extinction behavior. The putative neurotransmitters acetylcholine, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, endorphins and the peptides are reviewed, as are pharmacological agents such as the benzodiazepines, the barbiturates, the psychodelics, the neuroleptics, the psychomotor stimulants and cannabinoids. Other treatments and factors are considered such as peripheral hormones and the adrenal-pituitary axis. It is suggested that the noradrenergic system may be involved in the expression of extinction behavior by a role in selective attention, the dopamine system via an involvement with secondary reinforcement, the cholinergic system by a mechanism of response inhibition and the barbiturates and benzodiazepines by a block of nonreward.", 
    "45": "There is good evidence that many types of tranquilliser are effective in treating anxiety disorders that result from stress, but this evidence is not sufficient to recommend their use for acute stress disorders. Although there is little doubt that they will relieve the mood disturbance of severe mental and physical trauma, they may aid the process of denial. There is also a danger that short-term use of tranquillisers may progress to long-term dependence despite the initial intention of the prescriber. It is recommended that tranquillisers should be only used if the stress is severe enough to lead to marked changes in behaviour, is unpredicted and is likely to have a clear beginning and end. Benzodiazepines are usually the tranquillisers of choice but other drugs are available in patients prone to dependence.", 
    "46": "A double-blind trial was carried out in 40 anxious in-patients with insomnia to compare the hypnotic effectiveness and tolerance of loprazolam, 1 mg and 2 mg, versus placebo. Groups of 10 patients received one or other dose of loprazolam or placebo for 7 nights and then placebo for the following 3 nights. Sleep quality and morning residual effects were assessed each morning during the 10-day trial period by means of a sleep questionnaire. The results showed that 1 mg loprazolam was superior to placebo but less effective than 2 mg loprazolam. No side-effects were reported at either dose level.", 
    "47": "Ten male volunteers participated in a randomized crossover trial to compare the bioavailability of bromazepam (7-bromo-1,3-dihydro-5-(2-pyridyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) from two different preparations (Normoc, the test preparation, and a commercially available standard preparation). A single dose of 6 mg bromazepam was given. There was no difference in the USP XX rotating basket dissolution test between both preparations. The pharmacokinetic parameters elimination half-life, maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve were not significantly different. With the test preparation, however, smaller interindividual differences were seen. Only the time to peak plasma concentration showed a statistically significant difference. The test preparation yielded a flatter and smoother plasma bromazepam concentration curve compared with the standard preparation. This seems favourable in the case of subchronic dosing with regard to side effects, e.g. sedation.", 
    "48": "Suriclone, a new psychotherapeutic agent chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines or phenothiazines was assessed in a single-blind dose-ranging study to determine its efficacy and safety in out-patients with generalized anxiety disorder. Suriclone was an effective anxiolytic drug at a dose range between 1.2 mg. and 3.6 mg. per day. The drug, when effective, has a duration of action between 6 and 8 hours. There was no evidence of a rebound phenomenon. There was, however, a rapid return to pre-treatment level of anxiety. Side effects were few, mild and transient. This new molecule may herald an advance in the treatment of these disorders and should be investigated more fully.", 
    "49": "The endogenous trace amine beta-phenylethylamine (PE) produced tonic-clonic seizures in male Swiss mice when administered in doses of 125-200 mg/kg. The number of mice exhibiting PE-induced seizures, the latency to onset of first seizure and the latency to loss of the righting reflex were dose dependent. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepines diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, midazolam and clonazepam significantly reduced the incidence of PE-induced seizures. Similarly, increasing brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels by injection of the GABA-transaminase inhibitors aminooxyacetic acid or gabaculine afforded significant protection against PEA's convulsant effects. The data suggest that PE when administered at high doses may interfere either directly or indirectly with GABAergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system. In addition, since PE induces an epileptiform spiking pattern and produces seizures in rodents it appears possible that the amine may play a role in some forms of human epilepsy.", 
    "50": "Characteristics of primary cultures of neurons or of astrocytes are discussed which suggest that such cultures are appropriate models for their in vivo counterparts. Advantages or disadvantages of these cultures for studies of receptor binding are: Neuronal and astrocytic binding can be studied separately. Binding can be studied to intact cells or after homogenization. Apparent binding to intact cells may include unspecific retention. This seems to be a problem for beta-adrenergic ligands but not for benzodiazepines.", 
    "51": "Abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepine treatment in generalized anxiety patients was found to induce a rebound anxiety state in addition to minor physical symptoms. Controlled clinical trials suggest that the newer high potency benzodiazepines (alprazolam, clonazepam and bromazepam) have novel psychiatric indications and greater anxiolytic effect than the classical benzodiazepines. Alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, was superior to placebo in the treatment of panic disorder, for which medium or low potency benzodiazepines are generally inefficacious. Clonazepam, an anticonvulsant which increases 5HT synthesis, was more efficacious than lithium in reducing manic symptoms. Bromazepam, a new potent benzodiazepine, was superior to diazepam in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.", 
    "52": "Clinical observations are not always consistent with laboratory findings where half-life or pharmacokinetics do not always correlate with pharmacodynamics, ie. clinically effective duration of action. The parent compound, chlordiazepoxide, was observed to have anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant properties to varying degrees. Subsequently, diazepam seemed to exert a greater potency in these three areas. The final metabolite, oxazepam, has been observed to have a different therapeutic profile. The advent of the triazolo compounds brought a new dimension to benzodiazepine treatment both in primary and side effects. The relationship between blood levels and clinical efficacy is considered in the light of clinical observations as well as in the perspective of clinical management. Problems of tolerance and escalation of dosage must be addressed in the administration of these drugs where the confluence of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic findings may serve as a guide in the management of anxious patients.", 
    "53": "Ex vivo receptor binding as a function of time was determined in Charles River rats. The pharmacokinetic and protein binding parameters in man as well as the ex vivo receptor binding parameters in rat brain for three benzodiazepine induction agents, diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, were used to develop and test a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/receptor binding model. The model was subsequently used to predict changes in receptor binding and pharmacodynamics as a function of changes in pharmacokinetics. The model was found to be a good predictor of the relative onset and duration of the sedative and amnesic properties in normal subjects as well as in the presence of certain patho-physiological conditions and certain drug interactions.", 
    "54": "The contributions of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to the generation and maintenance of drug responses are reviewed from the literature. Potential pharmacokinetic determinants of duration of drug action are dose, lipid solubility and elimination half-life. Certain paradoxes are inherent in the view that clinical differences among benzodiazepines are due primarily to their elimination half-lives. It is concluded that the respective roles of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in the generation and maintenance of clinical responses to benzodiazepines require clarification.", 
    "55": "Behavioural actions of benzodiazepines have a number of significant characteristics. Anxiolytic effects are demonstrable both clinically and experimentally; in addition, there is excellent evidence for a reinforcing effect of these compounds, and a direct involvement in ingestional responses. This review focusses on the effects of benzodiazepines on the latter feeding and drinking responses. A necessary mediator of benzodiazepine action in the central nervous system appears to be the facilitation of inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission. It follows, therefore, that behavioural consequences of benzodiazepine action may depend crucially on enhanced GABAergic activity in the brain. Evidence for some involvement of GABAergic mechanisms in the control of feeding and drinking responses is reviewed. Only a few data are so far available to link benzodiazepines effects on ingestional behaviour directly to GABAergic transmission. A major current theme in the psychopharmacology of feeding and drinking behaviour is the possible involvement of endogenous opioid peptides. There is a strong suggestion in the experimental data that there are links between benzodiazepine and endorphinergic mechanisms in relation to ingestional responses. A promising future line of approach appears to be a delineation of benzodiazepine-GABA-endorphin interrelations in the control of food and water consumption.", 
    "56": "Temazepam, a benzodiazepine ataractic, given in a dose of 10 mg/kg ip to rats depressed the striatal contents of met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin by 60 and 35% resp. The changes were most pronounced 30 min after the treatment. In the hypothalamus temazepam produced a short-lasting elevation of met-enkephalin content (225% of the control value). The pattern of changes produced by temazepam resembles that described for diazepam. This suggests that enkephalins participate in the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepine ataractics on the central nervous system.", 
    "57": "Efficacy of and tolerance to 0.25 mg brotizolam and 0.25 mg triazolam were compared in hospitalised patients (aged 20 to 69 years) with sleep difficulties. Over 6 days there were no differences in efficacy and tolerance. The physicians reported the effectiveness of the drugs as good-to-satisfactory in 88.6% with brotizolam and 92.0% with triazolam. The patients reported with both drugs reduced time to fall asleep, less awakenings, increased duration of sleep and improved condition on awakening.", 
    "58": "Pharmacokinetics of oral brotizolam (0.50 mg) and triazolam (0.50 mg) were studied in healthy young volunteers. The plasma concentration profile of brotizolam can be described as a one compartmental open model with first-order absorption. The absorption of triazolam was less regular and in half of the subjects was not consistent with first-order kinetics. Inter-individual variability in absorption rate (peak times) was larger for brotizolam. Mean peak times were 1.1 +/- 1.0 h for brotizolam and 1.2 +/- 0.5 h for triazolam. Mean peak concentrations were 7.3 +/- 3.1 ng/ml and 5.0 +/- 3.9 ng/ml respectively. The elimination half-life of brotizolam was twice that of triazolam with mean values of 5.0 +/- 1.1 h and 2.6 +/- 0.7 h respectively. There was no correlation between the half-lives of the two drugs. Protein unbound fraction was similar for triazolam and brotizolam with mean values of 9.9 +/- 1.5% and 8.4 +/- 0.7% respectively.", 
    "59": "Hypnotics are central depressants. In sufficient doses, they suppress respiration, and so their effects on respiration are important considerations in their safety. The paper reviews mechanisms of respiratory control and methods of assessment, the effects of hypnotics on control of breathing and new methods of non-invasive respiratory monitoring.", 
    "60": "Since the introduction of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam many diazepines have been developed. Use of these drugs is increasing and considerable knowledge has accumulated about their mechanisms of action. The structural and pharmacological properties of these drugs are surveyed briefly.", 
    "61": "Pharmacologic agents currently used or being studied for the treatment of schizophrenia are reviewed. Neuroleptic medications are still the mainstay of treatment, but recent studies suggest new approaches to dosage and to the treatment of acute psychosis. Lithium is beneficial in psychotic illnesses with acute onset and a remitting course, regardless of the acute psychotic symptoms. Antidepressant agents may ameliorate depression in psychotic patients, but do not improve psychotic symptoms or social withdrawal. Propranolol's reported antipsychotic action has not been confirmed by controlled studies, but the drug may have a role in treating organic psychoses. The benzodiazepines, clonidine, and carbamazepine all merit more investigation as possible treatments for psychosis. The implications of differential treatment response among schizophrenic patients are discussed.", 
    "62": "Twenty-two patients were withdrawn from normal-dose, long-term benzodiazepine treatment and their data compared with those of two control groups. Patients and controls were assessed repeatedly on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Symbol Copying Test (SCT), Cancellation Task (CT), Auditory Reaction Time (RT) and Key Tapping Rate (KTR). A substantial and prolonged practice effect was found on all the tests except RT and KTR. Prior to withdrawal the patients did not show the performance decrement on the CT, RT and KTR customarily associated with the initial phases of benzodiazepine therapy. A rebound performance increment was observed on KTR during the withdrawal. Patients demonstrated impaired performance on tasks requiring the combined use of sensory and fine motor skills.", 
    "63": "In a double-blind, balanced crossover study, eight healthy male volunteers ingested either DL-308 (10 mg), DL-308 (20 mg), oxazepam (30 mg) or placebo. Subjective estimates of coordination and anxiety, objective performance measurements and cardiovascular measurements were taken at 1, 3, 5 and 8 h after ingestion. DL-308 (20 mg) exerted a strong sedative effect as judged by self-reported coordination scores and performance on logical reasoning and reaction time tests. The effect was evident almost immediately and, on the coordination and reasoning tests, lasted up to 8 h following ingestion. Attention is drawn to the need to extend performance testing in order to maximise test sensitivity. No drug had any consistent or strong influence on cardiovascular measures.", 
    "64": "Ten healthy male volunteers received, in randomized order, temazepam 20 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg or placebo in combination with ethanol 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 g/kg. Psychomotor tests were performed at regular intervals over 8 h. Ethanol alone at 0.4 g/kg significantly showed simple reaction time for between 30 and 60 min, whereas nitrazepam (5 mg) or temazepam (20 mg) plus the placebo alcohol dose (0.1 g/g) had no significant effect. The benzodiazepines and ethanol (0.2 and 0.4 g/kg) in combination showed no potentiation or prolongation of action. Both ethanol and the two benzodiazepines significantly reduced critical flicker detection in themselves and, in combination, had additive effects. Only nitrazepam and temazepam produced decreases in performance in the code substitution (DSST) test, and the time course of action of nitrazepam was markedly longer than that of temazepam. Ethanol alone had no detectable effect on immediate recall, prompted recall, learning, or word recognition tests. Both benzodiazepines reduced immediate and prompted recall and nitrazepam, in addition, reduced word recognition ability. It is concluded that the spectrum of CNS depressant actions of ethanol and the benzodiazepines are different and that there is no evidence of a potentiation or prolongation of their effects by concomitant administration of the doses used in the present study.", 
    "65": "The schistosomal nervous system uses some of the same neurotransmitters as the vertebrate system, but significant differences exist with respect to neurotransmitter metabolism and receptor specificity. The cholinergic system has been most extensively studied, and the serotoninergic system has also been examined carefully; catecholamines and benzodiazepines also seem to affect nervous system function. The objective of this work has been to determine whether neuroactive drugs could be used to disrupt the parasites' physiology sufficiently to have therapeutic impact, while avoiding toxic effects on the host nervous system. Promising findings have been made, suggesting that the unique properties of the schistosomal nervous system might be exploited to therapeutic advantage.", 
    "66": "Two theories have been put forth concerning the anxiolytic actions of the anti-anxiety drugs. One theory maintains that these drugs decrease locus coeruleus output, and the other maintains that they facilitate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission at benzodiazepine (BZ)-linked GABA receptors. The BZ-anxiolytic diazepam does decrease locus coeruleus neuronal impulse flow. However, this decrease is not due to effects on BZ-linked GABA receptors in the locus coeruleus. Furthermore, the non-BZ anxiolytic buspirone, its metabolite and its analog all slightly increase locus coeruleus neuronal impulse flow. This increase, in the case of the metabolite, appears to be due, in part, to blockade of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Finally, buspirone, unlike diazepam, did not potentiate GABA inhibition at BZ-linked GABA receptor sites (i.e. cerebellar Purkinje cells). These data suggest that the non-BZ anxiolytic buspirone produces its anti-anxiety effects by unconventional mechanisms.", 
    "67": "Buspirone is a clinically efficacious anti-anxiety drug without any other benzodiazepine-like activity. Although buspirone can displace ligands for dopamine (DA) receptors, its equipotent analog, MJ-13805, cannot. Buspirone can potently increase dopaminergic impulse flow and metabolism, primarily due to inhibition of DA autoreceptors. However, MJ-13805 does not block striatal nerve ending DA autoreceptors and slightly increases striatal DA metabolism. Both drugs potently reverse catalepsy due to either DA receptor blockade or DA depletion which indicates an effect within the extrapyramidal system efferent from the DA neuron. Amantadine is at least ten fold less potent than these drugs for reversal of catalepsy. These data indicate that altered dopaminergic neurotransmission may not be important for the anti-anxiety effect of buspirone and that buspirone should be tested for efficacy in various models of movement disorders. The site and mechanism of action for buspirone and MJ-13805 remains obscure. A metabolite of buspirone, 1-piperazinylpyrimidine, does not reverse catalepsy although this drug is known to be active in anti-anxiety screening tests. Thus, buspirone may have separate mechanisms of action for reduction of anxiety and reversal of catalepsy.", 
    "68": "Drug receptors consist of recognition sites coupled to transducer and cellular amplifier mechanisms. Slight differences in receptor recognition sites can be exploited pharmacologically to provide drugs with a high degree of selectivity for activating or blocking individual receptor subtypes. For example, it may now be possible to block, selectively, subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the gastrointestinal tract with pirenzepine and other drugs that discriminate between subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. The recognition of subtypes of adrenergic receptors may allow highly selective pharmacological activation and blockage of gastrointestinal neural and smooth muscle receptors. The development of nonpeptide receptor antagonists of gastrointestinal hormones and peptide neurotransmitters also offers promise for improved therapy of digestive diseases. Tremendous progress has occurred in recent years in defining multiple types of opioid receptors that alter gastrointestinal secretory, absorptive and motility functions. These receptors are located in the mucosa, nerves and muscle of the intestine and in the brain and spinal cord.", 
    "69": "The hypnotic action and residual effects of a single bedtime dose of 8-chloro-6(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine (midazolam, Ro 21-3981, Dormicum) (7.5 or 15 mg) or 8-chloro-6(o-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-S-triazolo[4,3-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine (triazolam) (0.25 or 0.5 mg) were investigated in young, healthy adults. Motor activity was continuously recorded by a wrist-worn activity monitor. In comparison to placebo, all compounds reduced night-time motor activity in the first half, but not in the second half of the night. Subjects rated their sleep as more quiet. Neither the spontaneous daytime motor activity nor the self-rated state in the morning and at noon was affected by drug intake in the preceding night. Performance in the morning as measured by a psychomotor test was significantly impaired only after triazolam 0.5 mg. There was no evidence for rebound insomnia in the 3 nights following drug intake. The results indicate that midazolam 15 mg and triazolam 0.25 mg have a reliable hypnotic action without significant residual sequelae.", 
    "70": "The alcohol-addictive metabolite hypothesis of alcohol addiction is reviewed. The status of monoamine oxidase in this clinical condition is also discussed and possible reasons for low platelet activity proposed. An endogenous monoamine oxidase inhibitor, which is also a benzodiazepine receptor ligand, denominated tribulin, is produced in excess following alcohol withdrawal and may, in fact, be a predisposing factor for or the actual agent precipitating delirium tremens. Alcohol suppresses tribulin production and predisposed individuals may drink it to counter the dysphoric effects of a baseline overproduction of this compound.", 
    "71": "The paper considers the rational biological basis for treatment of alcohol withdrawal reactions, alcoholic hallucinosis and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Both clinical and experimental data indicate that the alcohol withdrawal reaction reflects a state of hyper-reactivity of the central nervous system. The evidence comprises physiological, electrophysiological and biochemical findings. Magnesium, vitamins and antipsychotics are not specific in the treatment of the alcohol withdrawal reactions per se; rational treatment comprises drugs that may substitute for the suppressive effects of alcohol in the CNS during readaptation to the alcohol free condition (e.g. barbiturates or benzodiazepines). Alcoholic hallucinosis is characterised by acutely developed auditory hallucinations of an evil or reproachful nature. The condition may develop during or shortly after excessive alcohol consumption in chronic alcoholics. Suggestibility and unclear consciousness is not part of the condition. Tentatively three subgroups are suggested to occur: a) a withdrawal reaction; treatment with sedatives is recommended; the prognosis is good, b) a toxic reaction occurring during the drinking bout; this condition should be treated with antipsychotics until symptoms have disappeared. The prognosis is fairly good, c) a schizophreniform condition. Long-term treatment with antipsychotics must be applied. The Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is described. The condition often occurs during or shortly after an acute withdrawal reaction. The biochemical role of the etiological factor thiamine in glucose metabolism suggests that precautions (thiamine treatment) must be taken when giving a glucose load to alcoholics. Finally focus is set on the recent suggestion that the syndrome may in some cases result from an inborn enzymatic abnormality comprising low binding of thiamine pyrophosphate to transketolase. Psychobiological aspects of treatment in alcoholism may apply to a very large spectrum of conditions involving symptoms of cerebral, hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardial and peripheral nervous system origin. In the present expose we shall concentrate on organic cerebral reactions partly or exclusively presenting with psychiatric symptoms and signs. Thus the review will consider the rational biological basis for treatment of alcohol withdrawal reactions (including delirium tremens), alcoholic hallucinosis and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.", 
    "72": "A rapid and simple high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis of nitrazepam in plasma with temazepam as an internal standard is described here. Alternatively, this assay method can also be used to determine temazepam plasma concentrations with nitrazepam as the internal standard. Chloroform was used as an organic solvent for the extraction process. The percentage recoveries of nitrazepam and temazepam were 79% and 85%, respectively. The coefficient of variation of the within-day precision of the assay procedure at a concentration equal to 50 ng/ml of nitrazepam was 2.4% (n = 5), and that for day-to-day precision at the same concentration was 4.7% (n = 5). Calibration curves for nitrazepam and temazepam were linear over their therapeutic ranges. Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained with this method after a single oral dose of 5 mg of nitrazepam in five normal subjects were comparable to results obtained in previous studies.", 
    "73": "According to the two currently most popular biological hypotheses, schizophrenic symptoms result from a hyperactivity in dopaminergic neurotransmission or from a hypoactivity in GABAergic neurotransmission. Since diazepam is known to reduce dopamine release and to potentiate GABA, the possible beneficial effects of diazepam were tested in ten hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients who were resistant to standard neuroleptic treatment. High doses of diazepam, up to 200 mg/day initially, but smaller maintenance doses (less than 55 mg/day diazepam in eight of the ten patients) were added to the previous neuroleptic medication of these patients. The diazepam dose was adjusted daily to avoid oversedation. The effects of diazepam treatment on the mental status were assessed weekly for 12 weeks by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the physician's Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), and the Psychotic Inpatient Profile Scale (PIP). For additional documentation, videotapes of mental status interviews were obtained at baseline and during diazepam treatment. These videotapes were rated blind by an independent psychiatrist. The addition of diazepam produced a marked improvement in three, a moderate improvement in four, a mild improvement in one and no change in two of the ten patients. Four of the ten patients were so much improved that they were discharged from the hospital. No side effects were noted, except for one patient who became confused and disoriented on 160mg diazepam/day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "74": "Ethanol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines have similar pharmacological effects. All of these drugs facilitate the inhibitory transmission mediated by GABA. Drugs that facilitate GABAergic transmission are effective in alleviating ethanol withdrawal symptoms. Acute ethanol administration increases the number of low affinity GABA receptor sites, while, during ethanol withdrawal, the affinity of this site is decreased. This decreased affinity during withdrawal correlated with the audiogenic seizure activity. These results indicate that in vivo ethanol interacts with GABA receptors, and this interaction may be responsible for some of the effects of ethanol and for some symptoms of withdrawal. Ethanol, like pentobarbital, also enhances [3H]diazepam binding to the Lubrol-solubilized membrane fraction in vitro. This effect was dose-related and was blocked by picrotoxinin and other GABA antagonists. Enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding by various alcohols did not correlate with lipid:water partition coefficients. Ethanol also partially inhibited the binding of [3H]-alpha-dihydropicrotoxinin in the Lubrol-solubilized fraction. These results indicate that ethanol, like pentobarbital, may modulate the benzodiazepine binding component of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor-ionophore complex via the picrotoxinin site. The possible interpretation of these results, in relation to the GABAergic transmission, is discussed."
