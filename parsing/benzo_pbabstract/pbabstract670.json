After the internal standard, prazepam, is added, the serum is directly extracted with diethyl ether, the extract is evaporated, the residue is dissolved in ethanol, and the drug is measured by gas-liquid chromatography, with use of an electron capture detector. With this procedure, 2.5 ng of diazepam in the sample can be speedily measured with specificity, accuracy, and reproducibility (CV = 4.5%).", 
    "1": "The concentrations of nitrazepam in the plasma and cerebrospinal-fluid (CSF) of 38 neurological patients were determined by gas chromatography 2-36 hours after a single 5 mg oral dose. The percentage ratio between the mean CSF and the plasma concentrations increased from 8.0% at 2 hours to 15.6% at 36 hours. This percentage rise was significant (P less than 0.001). The maximum concentration of nitrazepam in the plasma was 36.7 +/- 5.7 ng/ml (at 2 hours) and CSF 3.0 +/- 0.3 ng/ml (at 4 hours). During the beta-phase the half-life of nitrazepam in plasma was about 27 hours and in the CSF markedly longer about 68 hours, indicating a very slow elimination of nitrazepam from the CSF.", 
    "2": "Review of antiepileptic drug assessment to date by means of the kindling model of epilepsy suggests that it fills a gap that is evident in standard screening methods such as maximum electroshock or pentylenetetrazol screening tests. However, in order to obtain a comprehensive profile of antiepileptic drugs regarding prophylaxis of developing seizures and treatment of well-established seizures through the kindling preparation, it is desirable to have the following: (1) standardization of kindling techniques, (2) examination of drug effects on developing as opposed to developed seizures, (3) use of a variety of animal species, involving different functional brain sites, and (4) monitoring of plasma levels of the drug administered. It is envisaged that judicious use of the kindling preparation might also enable us to gain some insight into the mechanisms by which drugs produce their prophylactic or therapeutic effect.", 
    "3": "The present review paper is dealing with the interaction between antihypertensive agents and various psychotropic drugs. Various psychotropic drugs enhance certain-side-effects of the antihypertensive substances, like sedation, extrapyramidal disorders and orthostatic hypotension. On the other hand, the blood-pressure lowering effect of clonidine, guanethidine and related drugs, and possibly also that of alpha-methy-dopa is reduced by phenothiazine-neuroleptics and tricyclic antidepressants (thymoleptics), but not by benzodiazepine tranquilizers or by butyrophenone-like neuroleptics. The pharmacological background and the clinical relevance of these interaction phenomena are discussed.", 
    "4": "Concentrations of nitrazepam in plasma were determined by gas chromatography in healthy volunteers after an acute peroral administration of nitrazepam (5 and 10 mg). Placebo tablets were also used, and an assessement of subjective drug effects was made during each medication. In addition serum growth hormone levels were determined. The peak plasma nitrazepam concentration was achieved at 120 minutes (46.9 +/- 3.2 ng/ml, mean +/- S.E.M.) after 5 mg of nitrazepam and at 180 minutes (82.8 +/- 10.5 ng/ml) after the dose of 10 mg. The half-life of nitrazepam in plasma ranged from 16.5 to 48.3 (mean 28.8) hours. A significant positive correlation was seen between the subjective sedative effects and the magnitude of the peak nitrazepam concentrations in plasma. This drug effect was highly significant when the plasma levels of nitrazepam were rising. The subjective sedative effects were more prominent after 10 mg than after 5 mg dose of nitrazepam. The plasma nitrazepam concentration was not significantly correlated with the subjective sedative effect the next morning, 12 hours after the drug intake. Serum growth hormone levels rose significantly during the study both after 5 mg and 10 mg nitrazepam doses (peak levels 16.3 +/- 4.0 and 12.7 +/- 3.1 ng/ml) and were significantly higher than after placebo administration (3.7 +/- 0.7 ng/ml).", 
    "5": "A double-blind comparison of the efficacy and safety of droperidol (5 mg), hydroxyzine HCl (50 mg), diazepam (5 mg), and saline placebo, given concomitantly with meperidine (50 or 75 mg) for preoperative medication, was conducted in 280 female patients scheduled for minor gynecologic procedures. Droperidol proved to significantly superior to the other study drugs in alleviating apprehension (83% of patients calm versus 54, 46, and 34% for hydroxyzine, diazepam, and placebo, respectively). Some drowsiness, occurred in 68 percent of the droperidol-treated patients versus 31, 30, and 21 percent of the other 3 groups, respectively. Global evaluations were consistent with these findings. No clinically significant changes were observed in vital signs in any of the study-drug groups. Adverse reactions were unremarkable in all groups. Significantly less nausea occurred with droperidol than with other treatments, and signficantly less vomiting occurred with droperidol or hydroxyzine. Significantly fewer patients in the droperidol group than in the diazepam group required postoperative antiemetics.", 
    "6": "This study reports the electronystagmographic results of 60 young children (3-6 years old) without any history of ear disease. Distribution into the groups \"without sedation\" and \"with sedation\" was done following a statistical key. The revolving chair was stopped after rotation at an angular velocity of 108 degrees/sec. Sedation was achieved by intramuscular injection of Valium. The statistical analysis of the various parameters is restricted to the postrotatory nystagmus I. Neither during the whole duration of the postrotatory nystagmus I nor during the cumulatory phase any significant difference in the total amplitude or number of beats could be observed. The only statistically significant difference was found in the maximal angular velocity; the reduction was 15+/-9% compared to the non sedated group. These results indicate that Valium can be used for sedation in nystagmographic examination.", 
    "7": "For 2 weeks 40 volunteers received either 5 mg diazepam, t.i.d., or 10 mg chlordiazepoxide, t.i.d., and placebo. A choice reaction test, two coordination tests, and an attention test were administered to the subjects on the 14th day of each treatment. Thirty minutes before the tests, the subjects ingested either alcohol., 5g/kg or a placebo drink, incombination with the last capsule. After the test the subjects rated the quality of their treatment as placebo, tranquilizer, or stimulant. The psychological tests taken before the treatments were Eysenck's EPIC-NESI, Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), and Cattell's 16 PF inventory. A multiple regression analysis was computed. Personality factor scores found to be associated with a strong effect of the benzodiazepines were 16 PF's A, C, L, N, and Q, and EPIC's E. The effect of alcohol was associated with a high score of 16 PFs B factor. Personality factors associated with \"placebo reactors\" and nonreactors were investigated, as well. Those subjects on placebo indicating their treatment to be active were classified as \"placebo reactors\". A discriminant analysis revealed that 16PF's O and I factors discriminated effectively \"placebo reactors\" from nonreactors, and EPIC's SE and 16 PF's L factor nonreactors from \"reactors\".", 
    "8": "The influence of several compounds activating or producing hypofunction of the serotonergic system was studied on the convulsive threshold and anticonvulsive action of benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam) in the pentylenetetrazol test. No changes in the convulsive threshold either for clonic, nor for tonic phase were found. However, the anticonvulsive action of benzodiazepines was enhanced by 5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-methoxytryptamine (given together with pargyline), or fenfluramine. p-Chlorophenylalanine and methergoline did not affect, but cyproheptadine enhanced the anticonvulsive action of most of benzodiazepines tested.", 
    "9": "The Authors carried out a clinical study of a new benzodiazepinic derivative (Ro 5-4200) presenting hypnotic properties particularly \"interesting\". The results emerged from this study confirmed the hypnotic efficacy of the preparation also in case of insomnia of a certain seriousness, as well as its excellent tolerance.", 
    "10": "The pertinence of a rating scale capable of characterizing presenting psychopathology and measuring degrees of change for psychoneurotic patients treated in an outpatient setting is described. Data for 328 patients who represent 1191 rating profiles were used to develop the factor structure for the New Physician's Rating List, a rating scale completed by health professionals after Patient interviews. Findings were used to develop the new Brief Outpatient Psychopathology Scale. A proposed factor structure is discussed. The structures of both scales include an Anxiety Syndrome composed of Anxiety and Psychomotor Activation Factors. The scales also include Depression and Somatization factors.", 
    "11": "1 The prolongation of pentobarbitone sleeping by five benzodiazepines, administered by prior intraperitoneal injection, was measured in mice. The pentobarbitone was injected either intraperitoneally or intracerebroventricularly. For each benzodiazepine, the prolongation was dose-related and differences in potency between benzodiazepines were not marked. 2 The percentage prolongation of sleeping times produced by most of the benzodiazepines was greater when the pentobarbitone was given intracerebroventricularly and was explained by a preferential addition of CNS depressant effects associated with this route. 3 To test whether the action of intraperitoneally administered pentobarbitone had been influenced by a metabolic component, the effects of nitrazepam on drug metabolism, measured by changes in plasma phenazone levels in the mouse, were studied. Nitrazepam (32 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a 23% reduction in the rate of phenazone metabolism. 4 Nitrazepam was also shown to have produced a transient fall in body temperature. Calculations based on Q10 values suggested that this hypothermia accounted, at most, for half the metabolic change measured.", 
    "12": "Thirty-four anxious patients with gastrointestinal disorders were studied in order to evaluate the effectiveness of a new 1,5-benzodiazepine antianxiety agent (HR 376). The disorders were classified as organic or functional according to the presence or absence of radiologic signs of ulcer. Dietetic measures, gastric antacids, anticholinergic agents, and antianxiety treatment were applied for six weeks. Anxiolytic treatment consisted of 30 mg/day clobazam (HR 376) or 15 mg/day diazepam, given in a randomized, double-blind manner. Clinical follow-up was performed with the PEN Personality Inventory (PEN), Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS), and Wittenborn Psychiatric Rating Scales (WPRS). The score of the psychoticism dimension of the PEN inventory was significantly higher in organic than in functional patients. Significant differences occurred in the reduction of the rating scores of HAS and WPRS before/after treatment in the clobazam and diazepam groups. This would express a modification of state anxiety. The TMAS, which evaluates trait anxiety, disclosed statistically significant improvement in the clobazam group. This group showed an early reduction of the HAS and TMAS scores, which would suggest an early onset of action.", 
    "13": "In this two-clinic seven-day double-blind study, 0.5 mg triazolam (Halcion) was compared to flurazepam (Dalmane) in the treatment of insomnia. Two clinical investigators completed 118 outpatients, 61 on triazolam and 57 on flurazepam. Five patients, four on triazolam and one on flurazepam, discontinued because of side effects; and three patients, one on triazolam and two on flurazepam, discontinued because of ineffectiveness of the medication. Analysis of pooled data for the 110 evaluable patients showed that 0.5 mg triazolam was significantly better than 30 mg flurazepam on the following parameters: (1) how much the medication helped the patients sleep, (2) onset of sleep, (3) duration of sleep, (4) evaluation of duration of sleep, and (5) feeling of restfulness in the morning. The trend for all other parameters favored triazolam treatment, but the values did not reach statistical significance. Side effects were similar in both groups, with drowsiness being reported most frequently. No change in efficacy indicating tolerance development during the seven days of drug administration was observed in either group.", 
    "14": "All-night sleep was polygraphically monitored from ten normal volunteers who took placebo and three dosage levels of a new benzodiazepine hypnotic, SCH 16134, in a double-blind, crossover design. All dosages of the drug decreased the time to fall asleep, and the two highest dosages also decreased interspersed wakefulness. REM sleep was suppressed, but slow-wave sleep was not affected in this experiment. The subjective quality of sleep was improved by the new hypnotic. One subject reported that he felt lethargic the day after the largest dose.", 
    "15": "In a double-blind, controlled study in 40 veterans, IM lorazepam was significantly superior to IM pentobarbital as a preoperative sedative and in ability to suppress the memory of events of the operative day. A trend was noted (not statistically in this small series) toward greater patient acceptance of lorazepam. No important adverse effects or changes in vital signs occurred with either agent.", 
    "16": "Nitrazepam in plasma was determined by gas-liquid chromatography with a nickel-63 electron-capture detector, unchanged by a direct method and also by a hydrolysis method. The extraction in the direct method was carried out with benzenedichloromethane (90:10) and in the hydrolysis method with diethyl ether. The hydrolysis was performed with 6 N sulphuric acid. The hydrolysis product was extracted with toluene-n-heptane-ethyl acetate (80:20:5) directly from acid. Thus the commonly used change in pH was omitted. Nitrazepam concentrations in plasma were determined in 10 healthy volunteers after two oral doses (5 and 10 mg); 0.5 ml of plasma was used for each determination and clonazepam, methylbromazepam and methylnitrazepam were used as internal standards. The recoveries of the methods are almost quantitative (greater than 96%). The two methods are clinically comparable. The high sensitivity and specificity make these methods useful in clinical determinations of nitrazepam in plasma. Advantages and disadvantages of both methods are discussed.", 
    "17": "Human serum albumin (HSA) has been chemically modified with 1,2-cyclohexanedione and N-acetylimidazole under nondenaturing conditions. Derivatives, in which 10 arginine residues (1,2-dihydroxycyclohex-1,2-ylene (DHCH)-HSA), 56 to 57 lysine and 5 tyrosine residues (acetyl-HSA), or 56 to 57 lysine residues alone (O-deacetyl-HSA) are modified, have been isolated. Their conformation has been tested by circular dichroism measurement, gel filtration on Sephadex G-150, and ultracentrifugation. From these analyses and binding studies it is concluded that only insignificant changes of conformation have occurred. The binding properties of the HSA derivatives have been tested with bilirubin, diazepam (a benzodiazepine drug), phenylbutazone, and indomethacin by circular dichroism. The binding of diazepam to DHCH-HSA is almost completely inhibited and that of phenylbutazone and indomethacin decreased, while the binding of bilirubin is essentially unaffected. In acetyl-HSA and O-deacetyl-HSA, the bilirubin binding is significantly decreased, while the binding of the drugs mentioned is less affected. It is concluded that bilirubin and the drugs bind to two separate sites which contain positive charges essential for the binding properties. The charge(s) in the benzodiazepine site from arginine.", 
    "18": "To enable recordings to be made of compound action potentials of the acoustic nerve using transtympanic electro-cochleography, a method of modified general anaesthesia with ketamine has been tested on forty children. Sufficient sedation and analgesia causing the least mental disturbance and possibly minimal stress to the cardio-respiratory system was of special interest. We used a combination of droperidol and fentanyl as premedication in low dosage to obtain a maximal efficiency of the possibly minimal medication of intravenously injected ketamine. A recovery phase without troubles was ensured in older children by additional i.v. diazepam medication during the time of ketamine administration.", 
    "19": "The influence of clonazepam on steady-state serum levels of diphenylhydantoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine was studied in 22 patients with epilepsy receiving one or two of these drugs. Clonazepam was given in slowly increasing doses for 2 weeks until a maximum dose of 4-6 mg per day was reached; thereafter the dose was kept constant. The serum levels of diphenylhydantoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine were determined once a week for at least 6 weeks. During clonazepam medication in ordinary doses the serum levels of the drugs in question were unaltered. Thus, it is unlikely that the antiepileptic effect of clonazepam in these patients even partly may be due to increased serum levels of these other drugs mentioned.", 
    "20": "Following the procedure we described for synthesizing analogous compounds in Note I (7), reaction of N,N-dialkyl or (N-alkyl,N-phenyl)ethoxycarbonylacetamides with 4-chloro-1,2-phenylendiamine, in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride, afforded 2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-4-dialkyl (N-alkyl,N-phenyl)amino-chloro-1H-1,5-benzodiazepines. When a large amount of phosphorus oxychloride was employed in the reaction, the formation of 2,4-di-(N-alkyl,N-phenyl)amino-3H-1,5-benzodiazepines was achieved, starting from suitable o-phenylendiamines and (N-alkyl,N-phenyl)ethoxycarbonylacetamides. Pharmacological tests were carried out on some compounds described in the present paper and on others reported in the preceding Note (7); in this connection 4-amino-1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives showed weak CNS depressing activity in addition, in some cases, to clear, although moderate, anticonvulsant activity, whereas 2,4-diamino-1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives were practically without effect.", 
    "21": "Sixty-nine female patients were assessed for anxiety before receiving premedication. Thirty-three were given lorazepam and 36 were given papaveretum. Re-evaluation 90 min after premedication indicated that lorazepam reduced significantly the level of anxiety, but that papaveretum did not. Anxiety was assessed by means of a five-point nurse-rating scale and the Multiple-Affect Adjective Check List self-rating form. This self-rating anxiety scale was sensitive and proved suitable for recumbent patients in hospital. The test scores compared favourably with previously published values.", 
    "22": "Conventional clinical trials using parallel groups are relatively insensitive to the effects of psychotropic drugs, especially antianxiety agents. Experimental paradigms based on the single organism research strategy offer an alternative. A free operant avoidance procedure clearly distinguished representative psychotropic compounds, including diazepam and pentobarbital, in normal subjects, and a multiple crossover procedure clearly detected antianxiety effects of diazepam in 11 psychoneurotic patients and antipsychotic effects of chlordiazepoxide in individual schizophrenic patients. Such procedures may serve to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in clinical practice as well as in research.", 
    "23": "Drugs used in the management of pregnancy-induced hypertension have been reviewed, and their value and adverse effects on both mother and fetus have been considered. Although magnesium and hydralazine remain the stalwarts of therapy, a number of other drugs have potential that may be realized in the future. Several new medications have promise in correcting the derangements of toxemia, but safety for the fetus has yet to be demonstrated. For the physician confronted with the complexities of old and new drugs in toxemia of pregnancy, the prayer of Lord Berkely may be just as appropriate in 1977 as it was dicades ago: From inability to let well enough alone, From too much zeal for the new, From too much contempt for what is old, From putting knowledge before wisdom and science before art, From making the cure of the disease more grievous than its endurnace, Good Lord, deliver us.", 
    "24": "Clonazepam was added to the treatment of patients with poorly controlled epilepsy in a double-blind trial and an open trial. Considerable improvement occurred with patients with myoclonic jerks and tonic-clonic convulsions, and with photosensitive epilepsy. Patients with atypical petit mal and focal epilepsies also improved. Drowsiness was initially common but lasted only a short time. No evidence was found for an action of clonazepam on the metabolism of other drugs, but treatment with phenobarbitone lowered serum concentrations of clonazepam. We conclude that clonazepam is particularly valuable in epilepsy with associated myoclonsu and in photosensitive epilepsy.", 
    "25": "Interrupting petit-mal status in infantile myoclonic seizures (n = 11), Lennox syndrom (n = 32), and in myoclonicastatic petit mal (n = 13) diazepame (Valium) and clonazepame (Rivotril) have been injected intraveneously in 56 patients during continuous EEG monitoring (38 patients with diazepame, 18 patients with clonazepame) (Table 1). A judgement according to the EEG findings and the apparent vigilance was performed thirty minutes after the injection was completed (Fig. 1 und 2; Table 3). Following results are presented: 1) There are no significant differences between clonazepame and diazepame with respect to therapeutic success (Table 3). 2. There are almost no differences concerning therapeutic success in the three forms of petit-mal status listed above (Table 3). 3) The initial success was 57%: 46% in infantile myoclonic seizures, 56% in Lennox syndrome, 70% in myoclonic-astatic petit-mal. The number of relapses for all forms was high: On the day following the injection only 18% of all patients did not show continued petit-mal-status: 18% in infantile myoclonic seizures, 15% in Lennox syndrome, 23% in myoclonicastatic petit mal (Table 3). 4) 13 patients were no longer in a status on the following day. 3 children were out of status spontaneously, independent from the intravenous application, 4 patients, one with infantile myoclonic seizures and 3 with Lennox syndrome, showed a focal EEG, 6 patients, 2 with infantile myoclonic seizures, 3 with Lennox syndrome, 4 with myoclonic-astatic petit mal, were further demonstrating generalised paroxysms (Fig. 1 und 2). 5) In infantile myoclonic seizures and in the Lennox syndrome almost always a focal EEG could be seen that accompanied the decrease of generalised paroxysms (hypsarrhythmia or 2/sec slow wave and spike). This finding has not been seen in the myoclonic-astatic petit mal, another sign that the latter is of primary generalised, \"centrencephal\" origin in contrast to the first two forms of convulsive disorders (Fig. 1, 2).", 
    "26": "A progressive form of myoclonus-epilepsy was described in an 21 year old girl. Electrophysiological and neuropharmacological studies were carried out. The typical EEG-pattern, the close association of cortical discharges and myoclonic jerks, the form of myoclonus indicated a \"pyramidal\" myoclonus. Pharmacological data suggested that two possible mechanisms--a partial deafferentation of cortical neurones and a failure of thalamic, extrapyramidal and brain stem reticular formations--might be responsible for the EEG-abnormalities and concomitant myoclonus. Results from neuropharmacological studies demonstrated a suppressive effect (on EEG-discharges and myoclonic jerks) of clonazepam, diazepam, phenobarbital, taurine, levodopa and budipin. Taurine, levodopa and budipin might induce a new aspect in therapy of progressive myoclonus epilepsy and of myoclonus caused by other etiologic factors.", 
    "27": "Diazepam 0.2 mg/kg, diazepam 0.3 mg/kg or a placebo were administered i.m., during labour, in a double-blind fashion to 28 multiparous patients. Although there were no significant differences in the requirements for i.m. pethidine during labour, diazepam was associated with a superior quality of pain relief. Diazepam 0.3 mg/kg i.m. produced no obvious adverse effects upon the neonate.", 
    "28": "The influence of starvation on the lipid metabolism was studied on male rabbits under usual conditions and in the presence of pyroxidine deficiency (4-deoxypyridoxine administration) and of thiamine (oxythiamine administration), and also in administration of neurotropic preparations (phenamine, seduxen). Starvation for 7 to 10 days led to increase of cholesterol and beta-lipoproteins level in the serum. Pyridoxine deficiency and phenamine administration caused a greater increase of cholesterol and especially or beta-lipoproteins. On the other hand, thiamine deficiency and seduxen administration limited an increase of cholesterol and beta-lipoproteins during hungry stress. Administration of aerovit for prophylactic purpose promoted a decrease of the metabolic shifts. The amount of cholesterol increased in the liver of hungry animals, especially after the phenamine administration and in the presence of pyridoxine deficiency; aerovit administration prevented increased cholesterol accumulation in the liver. The differences in the cholesterol level in the serum and and the liver can be explained by the changes of its biosynthesis during hungry stress.", 
    "29": "An improved electrolytic conductivity detector allowed the gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of medazepam, diazepam, and major metabolites in 2 ml plasma at concentrations of 20 microgram/l. The detector had a sensitivity limit of less than 1 ng (or 100 pg nitrogen) when operated in the nitrogen-selective mode and a nitrogen/carbon elemental selectivity ratio of greater than 100,000 compared to octadecane and cholesterol. Detector response when operated in various element-selective chemical modes was investigated, and its application to the analysis of the title compounds was compared to electron capture and flame ionization detection systems.", 
    "30": "A new series of 7-chloro- and 7-nitro-5-methoxy-5-phenyl-1,5-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones (7a, c--e) was synthesized and found to have potent antipentylenetetrazole activity. These compounds were also employed as intermediates in the synthesis of 3-substituted 1,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones (8f--v).", 
    "31": "The hydrolysis of nitrazepam involves a two-step sequential mechanism. The intermediate is the ring-opened compound resulting from scission of the azomethine bond. The final products are glycine and 2-amino-5-ni-robenzophenone. Recyclization of the intermediate to nitrazepam occurs at pH values above the pKa of the intermediate, in the pH region where the amino group of the intermediate is not protonated. As opposed to chlordiazepoxide and oxazepam, the initial hydrolysis step occurs at the 4,5-bond, not at the 1,2-amide linkage. This difference is attributed to a preferential activation for hydrolysis of the azomethine linkage by the nitro group. The hydrolysis involves an uncatalyzed reaction, specific acid-base catalysis, and general acid-base catalysis for acetate and phosphate buffers.", 
    "32": "The turnover rate of GABA is measured in substantia nigra, globus pallidus, N. accumbens, and striatum of rats injected with muscimol, a potent GABA agonist, and diazepam. The similarity of action of the two drugs on GABA turnover further supports the theory that diazepam acts as a GABA-mimetic drug. Haloperidol and clozapine affect GABA turnover differently in different nuclei. Haloperidol decreases GABA turnover in caudate but does not affect that in substantia nigra, whereas clozapine increases GABA turnover in both areas. However, both drugs accelerate GABA turnover in globus pallidus and N. accumbens. It is suggested that an increase of GABA turnover and perhaps of GABA release in striatum and substantia nigra may account for the lack of tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal side effects of clozapine.", 
    "33": "Current experimental paradigms emphasize neurotransmitter-specific interactions to explain the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines. According to this approach the broad range of effects observed suggests the involvement of several transmitter systems without rigorously establishing that any single transmitter system or physiological synaptic function is either necessary or sufficient to express all benzodiazepine actions. Among the effects that occur, potentiation of amino acid-mediated presynaptic inhibition in the spinal cord and postsynaptic inhibitions elsewhere in the brain are attractive testable hypotheses. However, direct physiological evidence that benzodiazepines stimulate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or other amino acids specifically and exclusively is needed to corroborate this view.", 
    "34": "The therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines in psychoneurosis may depend in part on their ability to release or disinhibit a patient's anxiety-suppressed gratification-seeking behavior. Benzodiazepines may disinhibit behavior by reducing the activity of serotonin (and possibly acetylcholine) neurons in the brain's \"punishment\" system. Reduction of serotonin transmission may be due to a facilitation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated presynaptic inhibition at the serotonin nerve terminal.", 
    "35": "The sedative, muscle relaxant, antianxiety, and anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepines may involve several distinct mechanisms because dissociation among these actions can be demonstrated with various drugs. Neurotransmitters displaying prominent interactions with benzodiazepines include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.", 
    "36": "The benzodiazepines are widely prescribed by many physicians for patients with depression, anxiety reaction, circulatory disorders, digestive disorders, tension headache, and pain in chest and back. According to various studies there is reason to believe that benzodiazepines not only possess the anxiolytic effects universally attributed to them but may also ameliorate somatic complaints affecting such systems as the cardiovascular and the gastrointestinal. twhether the bensodiazepines affect organ systems known to be linked in important pathophysiological ways to the nervous system deserves further study.", 
    "37": "Pharmacokinetic research has shown that clear differences exist among benzodiazepines in rate and route of elimination and in the presence or absence of pharmacologically active metabolites. These findings and other results of pharmacokinetic research have clinical implications in terms of dosage schedules, drug accumulation during long-term therapy, antianxiety therapy in the elderly, drug interactions, pharmacotherapy in specific disease states, and the influence of route of administration on drug action.", 
    "38": "In rats anesthetized with methoxyflurane, phenytoin (DPH) and medazepam (MDZ) were administered iontophoretically to pyramidal and granule cells discharging spontaneously or being driven by acetylcholine or glutamic acid. The objectives were to determine if: 1) these anticonvulsant agents exert direct effects on the rates of discharge of hippocampal neurons; 2) similarities exist between responses elicited by DPH and MDZ; and 3) pyramidal and granule cells differ in their responsiveness to the drugs. The firing rates of 38% of spontaneously active neurons were reduced by iontophoretic DPH. The incidence of depression by DPH depended upon the pretest discharge rates of the cells. Only 5% of cells with spontaneous rates less than 12/sec were depressed by DPH, but 80% with rates faster than 12/sec were inhibited. MDZ depressed 79% of spontaneously firing neurons regardless of pretest discharge rate. A majority of neurons whose firing rates were facilitated by either acetylcholine or glutamate were depressed by DPH or MDZ ejected iontophoretically. Pyramidal and granule cells responded similarly to putative transmitters, but differentially to the drugs. MDZ depressed a much greater proportion of spontaneously active granule cells then DPH. Phenytoin and MDZ differed with regard to the incidence of depression of spontaneous discharges, inhibition of slow firing cells, the proportion of granule cells depressed, and the duration of effect. These differences may be due to potency and pharmacokinetic factors or dissimilar mechanisms of action when the compounds are applied directly to single neurons.", 
    "39": "In this multi-clinic double-blind cross-over designed study, forty-five anxious and insomniac out-patients received either triazolam (Halcion) 0.25 mg or placebo at bedtime. After seven days the medications were crossed over. The dosage was doubled after nights 2 and 9 if good sleep was not produced. Three patients dropped out, two on placebo (one for side effects and one for lack of efficacy) and one on triazolam (due to misunderstanding instructions). Analysis of sleep questionnaire data showed superiority of triazolam to placebo (p less .001) in all parameters. The incidence of dreams was not affected. Analysis of antianxiety efficacy showed that triazolam was superior to placebo (p less than .001) in all parameters, both physician's and self ratings. Thus, either triazolam or a good night's sleep significantly relieved the patient's anxiety. No side effects or abnormal laboratory values of significance were attributable to triazolam.", 
    "40": "We reviewed all Mayo Clinic case histories in which a diagnosis of tardive dyskinesia or dyskinesia might have been recorded during the years 1965 through 1973 and interviewed 18 consecutive patients in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology. Among the histories and patients, we found a high incidence of primary affective disorders. Four of the five men had a history of chronic alcohol abuse and symptoms of depression. We recommend that people who have primary affective disorders and chronic alcohol abuse with depression should be given antipsychotic medication, stimulants, or diazepam only after extremely careful consideration.", 
    "41": "The effects of morphine sulfate and two benzodiazepine derivatives, chlordiazepoxide HCl and diazepam, were evaluated upon single unit activity of the amygdaloid nuclear complex and hippocampal formation in immobilized cats. All surgical procedures were performed under halothane anesthesia and all wound margins were infiltrated with Lidocaine after halothane withdrawal. Single unit activity was recorded extracellularly with platinum-iridium microelectrodes. Chlordiazepoxide HCl, 10.0-20.0 mg/kg i.v., or diazepam, 0.05-0.20 mg/kg i.v., suppressed spontaneous firing rates of the amygdala and the hippocampal neurons. In contrast, the spontaneous firing rates of neurons in these limbic structures were augmented by morphine sulfate, 0.50-2.00 mg/kg i.v. The morphine-induced augmentation of hippocampal neuronal activity was effectively antagonized by naloxone, 0.10-0.20 mg/kg i.v. However, naloxone, 0.20-0.40 mg/kg i.v., only partially suppressed the morphine induced augmentation of amygdala neuronal activity. In a dose-dependent fashion, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam administration prevented or antagonized morphine-induced augmentation of amygdala and hippocampal neuronal activity. Our results suggest that, in the cat, the amygdala and hippocampus may play an important role for morphine-induced behavioral responses. Moreover, our data imply that these two limbic structures may be the sites of tranquillizing actions of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "42": "A rapid, sensitive and specific gas-liquid chromatographic method for the measurement of pinazepam and its metabolites in biological fluids is reported. After a single extraction of the sample with toluene, the organic phase is concentrated and, after chromatography on a 3% OV-17 column, measured with an electron-capture detector. The sensitivity was 1.0 ng/ml for pinazepam and 5.0 ng/ml for its metabolites. Plasma levels and urinary excretion in human volunteers and plasma and milk levels in women suffering from anxiety during breastfeeding are reported.", 
    "43": "A sensitive and specific blood level method employing differential extraction was developed for the determination of clorazepate and its N-desmethyldiazepam metabolite by electron capture gas-liquid chromatography (GLC-ECD). The assay requires the initial extraction of N-desmethyldiazepam, the major metabolite, into benzene-methylene chloride (90:10) from the biological sample made alkaline with 0.1 N NaOH. The samples is then acidified with 2 N HCl to decarboxylate clorazepate to N-desmethyldiazepam, which is then extracted into benzene-methylene chloride (90:10) after adjusting the pH to 12.8 with NaOH. The two extracts are evaporated and the residues are dissolved in benzene which contains griseofulvin as the reference standard. These solutions are assayed by GLC-ECD. The overall recovery and sensitivity limit of the assay for clorazepate is 60+/-5% (S.D.) and 4.0 ng/ml blood, respectively, while that for N-desmethyldiazepam is 95+/-5% (S.D.) and 4.0 ng/ml blood, respectively. The urinary excretion of clorazepate was determined by the measurement of the levels of N-desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam, the major urinary metabolites of clorazepate, both prior to and after enzymatic deconjugation. These methods were applied to the measurement of clorazepate and its metabolites in blood and urine following a single 15-mg dose of clorazepate dipotassium.", 
    "44": "Acute stressing procedures cause a shortlasting increase in the levels of guanosie 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) in mouse brain without significantly influencing the concentrations of adenosine 3'-5'-monophosphate (cAMP). Animals were pretreated with various centrally acting drugs before being stressed in order to study the involvement of specific neurotransmitters in the stress-induced rise of cGMP levels. Centrally depressant drugs affecting different synaptic mechanisms, such as chlorpromazine, reserpine, haloperidol, diazepam, and pentobarbital, inhibited the cCMP increase elicited by stress. Pretreatment with atropine, diphenhydramine, antazoline, cyproheptadine, phentolamine, bunitrolol, and indomethacin had no significant effect. Clonidine and both the (-)- and (+)-isomers of propranolol inhibited the stress-induced cGMP increase in a dose-related manner. Our results suggest that norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, or prostaglandins are not involved in the elevation of cGMP levels elicited by acute stress. Participation of other neurotransmitter(s), such as dopamine or GABA, cannot be excluded."
