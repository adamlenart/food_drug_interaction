The atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, have supposed an important advance in the treatment of schizophrenia. The greater cost of atypical antipsychotics with respect to conventional drugs has led to the conduction of pharmacoeconomic studies to determine its efficiency. This article reviews the complete pharmacoeconomic studies that compare olanzapine with haloperidol and risperidone in the treatment of schizophrenia. Cost analyses comparing olanzapine and haloperidol show that the former drug does not add increased cost to therapy, and even contributes to lessen expenses fundamentally as a result of a decrease in hospitalizations. In the economic evaluations comparing olanzapine and risperidone, the results are not conclusive, and in general, the total costs associated with both treatments were similar. In the treatment of bipolar disorder, although few studies have estimated the economic impact of olanzapine, it has been observed a reduction of hospitalization costs associated to the treatment with olanzapine.", 
    "1": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic, frequently relapsing illness with a prevalence of 1.2% to 3.4% in the general population. It is associated with high disability, higher comorbidity due to medical illnesses, and significant social and economical consequences for patients, their families, and society. The episodic nature of this disease warrants rational use of medications and proper monitoring for adverse events. Various drug classes, such as mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants, are used for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Each group of drugs is associated with wide array of adverse events and drug interactions, which are the main hurdles in treatment outcome and compliance. Common side effects seen with several agents, particularly antipsychotics, are somnolence, weight gain, extrapyramidal symptoms, dyslipidemia, type-2 diabetes, and hyperprolactinemia. Major drug interactions are seen with drugs such as carbamazepine, due to hepatic enzyme induction. Adverse effects such as somnolence are tolerability concerns and can be managed easily; others, such as diabetes mellitus, are safety concerns. It is prudent to have precise knowledge of the individual drug's side-effect profile, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, to plan a treatment regimen. More research is needed to understand potential risks of various drugs and to devise and incorporate monitoring protocols in the treatment regimen.", 
    "2": "We previously defined a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus sequence [CRAC: L/V-X (1-5)-Y-X (1-5)-R/K] in the carboxyl terminus of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a high-affinity drug and cholesterol-binding protein present in the outer mitochondrial membrane protein. This protein is involved in the regulation of cholesterol transport into the mitochondria, the rate-determining step in steroid biosynthesis. Reconstituted wild-type recombinant PBR into proteoliposomes demonstrated high-affinity 2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide and cholesterol binding. In the present work, we functionally and structurally characterized this CRAC motif using reconstituted recombinant PBR and nuclear magnetic resonance. Deletion of the C-terminal domain of PBR and mutation of the highly conserved among all PBR amino acid sequences Y152 of the CRAC domain resulted in loss of the ability of mutant recPBR to bind cholesterol. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of a PBR C-terminal peptide (144-169) containing the CRAC domain indicated a helical conformation for the L144-S159 fragment. As a result of the side-chain distribution, a groove that could fit a cholesterol molecule is delineated, on one hand, by Y152, T148, and L144, and, on the other hand, by Y153, M149, and A145. The aromatic rings of Y152 and Y153 assigned as essential residues for cholesterol binding constitute the gate of the groove. Furthermore, the side chain of R156 may cap the groove by interacting with the sterol hydroxyl group. These results provide structural and functional evidence supporting the finding that the CRAC domain in the cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domain of PBR might be responsible for the uptake and translocation of cholesterol into the mitochondria.", 
    "3": "Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy, or Dravet syndrome, is one of the catastrophic epilepsy syndromes. In the past, treatment was mainly based on valproate and phenobarbital. Recently, some of the new antiepilepsy drugs, such as topiramate and stiripentol, have been shown to be promising in the treatment of this epilepsy syndrome. The treatment regimen of 12 children with Dravet syndrome and proven mutations in the alpha subunit of the sodium channel SCN1A is reported here. Five patients on the \"traditional\" treatment regimen are compared with seven children on an \"optimal\" treatment regimen based on a combination of valproate and topiramate. With respect to the literature and our own experience, we propose guidelines for \"optimal\" treatment of children with severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy. This includes prevention of hyperthermia, rigorous treatment of fever, avoiding stressful situations, maintenance treatment based on a combination of only two antiepilepsy drugs (ie, valproate and topiramate), and a strict acute seizure treatment based on benzodiazepines. To prevent long-lasting periods of status epilepticus, this acute seizure treatment must be taught to parents and caregivers.",

The medetomidine protocol used smaller drug volumes, and induction and recovery times were shorter. Although cardiopulmonary abnormalities were noted, none were likely to be life threatening.", 
    "5": "This study was designed to compare the effects of alfentanil and midazolam pre-medication on patient comfort during and after flexible bronchoscopy. A randomised, double-blind study was performed; 40 patients received alfentanil and 29 midazolam. Subjects completed questionnaires about discomfort and adverse effects immediately post-procedure and 24 h later. The bronchoscopist also completed a questionnaire. No difference in patient discomfort was found immediately post-procedure and no differences were found for amount of topical lignocaine used or minimum oxygen saturation. Operators reported no overall difference between the agents for ease of procedure but about 20% less cough was reported in the alfentanil group (P = 0.02). Patient discomfort scores in the 24h questionnaire were significantly lower in patients given midazolam (P = 0.01 for nasal discomfort, P = 0.003 for throat discomfort) but drowsiness was commoner in this group (P = 0.04). There was no significant difference in patients' reports of cough, nausea or vomiting or their willingness to have a repeat procedure. In conclusion, cough during bronchoscopy was slightly less marked with alfentanil than midazolam pre-medication but this made no difference to the ease of procedure or to overall patient discomfort. Patients given midazolam reported less discomfort when asked about the test 24 h later.", 
    "6": "Aminoglutethimide (AGLD, an inhibitor of adrenal steroid synthesis) up to 5 mg/kg and spironolactone (SPIR, a mineralocorticosteroid antagonist and a weak antiandrogen) up to 50 mg/kg did not affect any seizure parameter in amygdala-kindled rats. AGLD (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced seizure activity in rats of both gender. The combination of AGLD (5 mg/kg) with phenobarbital (PB, applied at its subeffective dose of 15 mg/kg) significantly shortened motor seizure and afterdischarge duration in amygdala-kindled seizures. The combined treatment of AGLD (5 mg/kg) and clonazepam (CLO) at its subeffective dose of 0.01 mg/kg caused significant reduction of the seizure severity, seizure duration and afterdischarge duration. Finally, AGLD (5 mg/kg) proved ineffective upon the action of valproate (VPA) in this model of epilepsy. In contrast to AGLD, SPIR (50 mg/kg) did not affect the action of PB, CLO or VPA against kindled seizures in rats. AGLD did not alter the free plasma levels and brain concentration of PB or CLO, so a pharmacokinetic interaction does not seem probable. Among a variety of chemoconvulsants, bicuculline and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid reversed the effects of AGLD/PB and AGLD/CLO combinations. Aminophylline, kainic acid, strychnine and the glucocorticosteroid (hydrocortisone) were ineffective in this respect. Our data confirm the hypothesis that AGLD-mediated events may play a role in seizure activity and can affect the anticonvulsant activity of some conventional antiepileptic drugs against kindled seizures. Moreover, extrapolation of obtained results to clinical practice may indicate that patients with complex partial seizures may be safely co-medicated with AGLD or SPIR without the risk of worsening of seizure control.", 
    "7": "The anticonvulsant effects of lamotrigine (LTG) and clonazepam (CZP) and combinations thereof against maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures in mice were investigated using three-dimensional (3D) isobolographic analysis. With this method, the doses of fixed-ratio combinations of the drugs (1:3, 1:1 and 3:1) that elicited 16, 50 and 84% of the maximum anticonvulsant effect were determined. Additionally, to evaluate the characteristics of interactions observed with 3D isobolography, the brain concentrations of both drugs were verified pharmacokinetically. The 3D isobolographic analysis showed that LTG and CZP combined at the fixed ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 interacted synergistically in the MES test for all anticonvulsant effects between 16% and 84% of maximum. In contrast, the combination of LTG and CZP at the fixed ratio of 1:3 showed only pure additivity for all estimated effects in 3D isobolography. Moreover, none of the examined antiepileptic drugs altered the brain concentrations of the coadministered drug, so the observed interactions in the MES test are of a pharmacodynamic nature. The 3D isobolographic findings suggest that in epilepsy therapy, increased efficacy of seizure control (synergistic interaction) might be achieved by using LTG and CZP in combination. In this study, some important problems and assumptions related to statistical analysis of data in 3D isobolography are discussed.", 
    "8": "Pirenzepine, an M1 selective muscarinic antagonist, is effective in slowing the progression of myopia in both humans and experimental animals, including chick. As an M1 selective antagonist, pirenzepine is considered to mediate its effect through M1 receptors. However, there is currently no report of the M1 receptor in chicken. Therefore, if the mechanism of action of pirenzepine is similar across species, either the drug mediates its effect through a non-M1 mechanism, or M1 muscarinic receptors are present in chicken. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a genetic template for the M1 receptor was expressed, or even present, in chick.", 
    "9": "Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and Southern and northern blotting analyses were used to search for M1 mRNA in chick ocular and brain tissues. PCR and Southern analyses were then used for searching the chick M1 gene and promoter. Appropriate rat positive controls were included throughout the study.",

Identical results were obtained from PCR amplification and were further confirmed by Southern analysis. Similarly, no M1 gene or promoter sequences were detected by PCR or Southern analyses. Our methods were validated in every case by a positive finding in equivalent rat tissue and by detection of M2 and M4 mRNA expression in chick retina.", 
    "11": "Findings in this study suggest that the chick does not possess an M1 receptor. This finding is of primary interest to vision researchers in that it suggests pirenzepine is unlikely to mediate its inhibitory effect on the progression of myopia through an M1 receptor in chick. Alternative mechanisms of action are discussed.", 
    "12": "Rod signals traverse several synapses en route to cone bipolar cells. In one pathway, rods communicate directly with cones via gap junctions. In a second pathway, signals flow rods-rod bipolars-AII amacrines-cone bipolars. The relative contribution of each pathway to retinal function is not well understood. Here we have examined this question from the perspective of the AII amacrine. AIIs form bidirectional electrical synapses with on cone bipolars. Consequently, as on cone bipolars are activated by outer plexiform inputs, they too should contribute to the AII response. Rod bipolar inputs to AIIs were blocked by AMPA receptor antagonists, revealing a smaller, non-AMPA component of the light response. This small residual response did not reverse between -70 and +70 mV and was blocked by carbenoxolone, suggesting that the current arose in on cone bipolars and was transmitted to AIIs via gap junctions. The residual component was evident for stimuli 2 log units below cone threshold and was prolonged for bright stimuli, demonstrating that it was rod driven. Because the rod bipolar-AII pathway was blocked, the rod-driven residual current likely was generated via the rod-cone pathway activation of on cone bipolars. Thus for a large range of intensities, rod signals reach the inner retina by both rod bipolar-AII and rod-cone coupling pathways.",

The response to irinotecan is variable, possibly because of interindividual variation in the expression of the enzymes that metabolize irinotecan, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). We prospectively explored the relationships between CYP3A phenotype, as assessed by erythromycin metabolism and midazolam clearance, and the metabolism of irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38.",

Erythromycin metabolism was not statistically significantly associated with irinotecan clearance (P = .090), whereas midazolam clearance was highly correlated with irinotecan clearance (r = .745, P<.001). In addition, the presence of a UGT1A1 variant with a (TA)7 repeat in the promoter (UGT1A1*28) was associated with increased exposure to SN-38 (435 ng x h/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 339 to 531 ng x h/mL in patients who are homozygous for wild-type UGT1A1; 631 ng x h/mL, 95% CI = 499 to 762 ng . h/mL in heterozygous patients; and 1343 ng x h/mL, 95% CI = 0 to 4181 ng x h/mL in patients who are homozygous for UGT1A1*28) (P = .006).",

Intramuscular olanzapine is comparable to haloperidol or lorazepam monotherapy in managing acute agitation associated with schizophrenia and dementia. Intramuscular olanzapine is superior to lorazepam monotherapy in the management of agitation associated with bipolar affective disorder. Preliminary evidence demonstrates that intramuscular olanzapine is associated with fewer adverse movement disorders than monotherapy with intramuscular haloperidol.

    "26": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA), receptor ion channel is lined by the second membrane-spanning (M2) segments from each of five homologous subunits that assemble to form the receptor. Gating presumably involves movement of the M2 segments. We assayed protein mobility near the M2 segment extracellular ends by measuring the ability of engineered cysteines to form disulfide bonds and high affinity Zn(2+)-binding sites. Disulfide bonds formed in alpha1beta1E270Cgamma2 but not in alpha1N275Cbeta1gamma2 or alpha1beta1gamma2K285C. Diazepam potentiation and Zn2+ inhibition demonstrated that expressed receptors contained a gamma subunit. Therefore, the disulfide bond in alpha1beta1E270Cgamma2 formed between non-adjacent subunits. In the homologous acetylcholine receptor 4-A resolution structure, the distance between alpha carbon atoms of 20' aligned positions in non-adjacent subunits is approximately 19 A. Because disulfide trapping involves covalent bond formation, it indicates the extent of movement but does not provide an indication of the energetics of protein deformation. Pairs of cysteines can form high affinity Zn(2+)-binding sites whose affinity depends on the energetics of forming a bidentate-binding site. The Zn2+ inhibition IC50 for alpha1beta1E270Cgamma2 was 34 nm. In contrast, it was greater than 100 microM in alpha1N275Cbeta1gamma2 and alpha1beta1gamma2K285C receptors. The high Zn2+ affinity in alpha1beta1E270Cgamma2 implies that this region in the beta subunit has a high protein mobility with a low energy barrier to translational motions that bring the positions into close proximity. The differential mobility of the extracellular ends of the beta and alpha M2 segments may have important implications for GABA-induced conformational changes during channel gating.", 
    "27": "This manuscript described a new sensitive determination of midazolam and its metabolite 1'-hydroxymidazolam by automated column-switching high-performance liquid chromatography. The test compounds were extracted from 2 ml of plasma using chloroform-hexane (30:70, v/v) and the extract was injected into a column I (TSK-PW precolumn, 10 microm, 35 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) for clean-up and column II (C18 STR ODS-II analytical column (5 microm, 150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) for separation. The mobile phase for separation consisted of phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 4.6), perchloric acid (60%) and acetonitrile (57.9:0.1:42, v/v/v) and was delivered at a flow-rate of 0.6 ml/min. The peak was detected using a UV detector set at 254 nm. The method was validated for the concentration range 0.3-100 ng/ml, and good linearity (r > 0.998) was confirmed. Intra- and inter-day coefficient variations for midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam were less than 8.5 and 6.1%, respectively, at the concentrations of 0.5, 5 and 50 ng/ml for the test compounds. Relative errors ranged from -14 to 6% and mean recoveries were 78-85%. The limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/ml for each compound. This method was sensitive enough for pharmacokinetic studies measuring CYP3A activity in human volunteers following an intravenous (1 mg) and a single-oral administration (2 mg) of a subtherapeutic midazolam dose.",

    "32": "Cannabis has been used for recreational, medicinal and religious purposes in different cultures since ancient times. There have been various reports of adverse effects due to or associated with cannabis consumption, including psychotic episodes. Historically, our understanding of these clinical observations has been significantly hindered by a lack of knowledge regarding their underlying neurobiological and pharmacological processes. However, the discovery of the endogenous cannabinoid system has allowed a greater understanding of these adverse effects to develop. From a clinical perspective, toxic or transient psychotic reactions to the administration of herbal cannabis preparations or specific cannabinoid compounds have to be differentiated from longer-lasting, persistent schizophrenia-like disorders associated with the use of cannabis/cannabinoids. The latter are most likely to be associated with a predisposition or vulnerability to schizophrenia. Interestingly, the recently suggested role of the endogenous cannabinoid system in schizophrenia not related to previous cannabinoid consumption introduces an additional perspective on the mechanism underlying cannabis-associated schizophrenia-like disorders, as well as on the effects of cannabis consumption in schizophrenia. At present, acute psychopharmacological treatment options for cannabis-associated transient and persistent schizophrenia-like psychotic episodes are similar and are based on the use of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. However, new pharmacological strategies using the endogenous cannabinoid system as a primary target are under development. Long-term psychotherapeutic treatment options involve case management strategies and are mainly based on specialised psychotherapeutic programmes to encourage cannabis users to stop their use of the drug.", 
    "33": "Methods for the synthesis of dihydroazaphenanthrene fused to macrocycles (2) and medium-ring heterocycles (4), as well as 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones (5), are developed. A distinctly different catalytic property of palladium and copper catalysts was uncovered that leads to the development of a divergent synthesis of two different heterocyclic scaffolds from the same starting materials, simply by metal-switching. Thus, starting from linear amide 3, palladium acetate triggers a domino intramolecular N-arylation/C-H activation/aryl-aryl bond-forming process to provide 4, while copper iodide promotes only the intramolecular N-arylation reaction leading to 5. In combination with the Ugi multicomponent reaction (Ugi-4CR) for the preparation of the linear amides, a two-step synthesis of either the 5,6-dihydro-8H-5,7a-diazacyclohepta[jk]phenanthrene-4,7-dione (4) or 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones (5), by appropriate choice of metal catalyst, is subsequently developed from very simple starting materials.", 
    "34": "Recently, atypical antipsychotic agents have largely replaced traditional agents as first-line drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia and psychotic mood disorders. Considering the increase in atypical antipsychotics prescriptions and the increased risk of suicide in this patient population, the number of reported cases of antipsychotic drugs may be expected to increase. This paper describes the clinical course of atypical antipsychotic agents intoxication, chiefly clozapine, risperidone and olanzapine. Clozapine was the ingestant in 11 cases of atypical antipsychotics overdose in our material. The major observed effects in this group included deep coma, tachycardia, hypersalivation, delirium and shock. Clozapine has a small therapeutic index; in our patients the mortality rate was 27%. Ten patients with risperidone overdose were identified. Our data show that risperidone toxicity manifests mainly as mild central nervous system effects: somnolence, vertigo and tardive dyskinesia. Olanzapine has been considered to be similar to clozapine, but olanzapine intoxication appeared to have a relatively benign clinical course as compared with clozapine intoxication. In olanzapine intoxications deep coma, myosis and mild cardiovascular effects (hypotonia) were observed.",

The patients hospitalised in relation to chronic ethanol abuse in years 2001-2002 at the Internal Medicine Ward of the Specialist Hospital in Bia\u0142a Podlaska were subjected to the study. In those years alcohol related patients made 2 and 3% of the total amount of patients, respectively. Among the patients, men aged 40-49 years old prevailed. The most common diagnoses in the analysed group were: alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and acute pancreatitis. In the treatment of withdrawal symptoms diazepam was used. Only few percent of patients in the analysed group needed physical restraints because of their great agitation. Early recognition and correct treatment of threatening alcohol withdrawal syndrome diminishes the risk of severe symptoms and complications.",

The group analyzed comprised of 1117 patients, 629 (69.1%) women and 425 (38.1%) men. In the female group, teenagers under 19 constituted 48.9%, whereas young females ranging in age from 20 to 29 years--51.1%. In the male patients group teenagers under 19 constituted 29.4%, the young men (20-29 years of age)--70.6%. The group was analyzed from the point of view of demographic, clinical and social factors such as gender, age, level of education, marital status and occupation (if applicable), the course of self-poisoning and kind of toxic substance involved. In the majority of cases, self-poisoning had been caused by taking one type of medicines, and less frequently by taking mixed-type medicines or by simultaneously taking medicines and ethanol. The most typical drugs used in the attempts included benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory and antiepileptic drugs. The assessment of the poisoning severity based on the PSS classification, indicates the predominance of the minor and moderate poisoning. Up to 50% of subjects suffered from mental disorders--most frequently from affective disorders, neurotic disorders, and personality disorders. As an essential part of the problem of suicidal behaviors in teenagers and young adults, suicide attempts among young population require an in-depth analysis. The scale of the problem indicates the necessity of initiating appropriate preventive actions and organizing appropriate psychological and psychiatric care.", 
    "39": "OP/nerve agents are still considered as important chemicals acting on living organisms and are widely used. They are characterized according to their action as compounds influencing cholinergic nerve transmission via inhibition of AChE. Modeling of this action and extrapolation of experimental data from animals to humans is more possible for highly toxic agents than for the OP. The symptoms of intoxication comprise nicotinic, muscarinic, and central symptoms; for some OP/nerve agents, a delayed neurotoxicity is observed. Cholinesterases (AChE and BuChE) are characterized as the main enzymes involved in the toxic effect of these compounds, including molecular forms. The activity of both enzymes (and molecular forms) is influenced by inhibitors (reversible, irreversible, and allosteric) and other factors, such as pathological states. There are different methods for cholinesterase determination; however, the most frequent is the method based on the hydrolysis of thiocholine esters and subsequent detection of free SH-group of the released thiocholine. The diagnosis of OP/nerve agent poisoning is based on anamnesis, the clinical status of the intoxicated organism, and on cholinesterase determination in the blood. For nerve agent intoxication, AChE in the red blood cell is more diagnostically important than BuChE activity in the plasma. This enzyme is a good diagnostic marker for intoxication with OP pesticides. Some other biochemical examinations are recommended, especially arterial blood gas, blood pH, minerals, and some other specialized parameters usually not available in all clinical laboratories. These special examinations are important for prognosis of the intoxication, for effective treatment, and for retrospective analysis of the agent used for exposure. Some principles of prophylaxis against OP/nerve agent poisoning comprising the administration of reversible cholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine (alone or in combination with other drugs), scavengers such as preparations of cholinesterases, some therapeutic drugs, and possible combinations are given. Basic principles of the treatment of nerve agent OP poisoning are described. They are based on the administration of anticholinergics (mostly atropine but some other anticholinergics can be recommended) as a symptomatic treatment, cholinesterase reactivators as a causal treatment (different types but without a universal reactivator against all OP/nerve agents) as the first aid and medical treatment, and anticonvulsants, preferably diazepam though some other effective benzodiazepines are available. New drugs for the treatment are under experimental study based on new approaches to the mechanism of action. Future trends in the complex research of these compounds, which is important not only for the treatment of intoxication but also for the quantitative and qualitative increase of our knowledge of toxicology, neurochemistry, neuropharmacology, clinical biochemistry, and analytical chemistry in general, are characterized.",

When cultured in a submerged mode in Abe medium, the alkaloids are mostly secreted into the medium. The dynamics of aurantine and aurantiamine accumulation in the medium is characterized by the presence of a relatively sharp maximum in the idiophase, whereas the accumulation of anacine in the medium is characterized by an extended plateau and occurs concurrently with fungal growth.", 
    "41": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, is involved in the pathophysiology of a wide variety of disorders, including anxiety. Tiagabine hydrochloride acts as a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor (SGRI).", 
    "42": "Consecutive patients were offered tiagabine in 1-mg incremental doses for the treatment of anxiety, primarily generalized anxiety disorder. Individuals failing anxiety treatment with benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone, and/or with a strong family or personal history of substance abuse were allowed trials. The SGRI tiagabine improved anxiety and was well tolerated by adult patients with generalized anxiety disorder as well as one patient with anxiety secondary to acute antidepressant withdrawal. One disinhibition treatment failure is also discussed.", 
    "43": "In acute anxiety treatment, very low initial dosing with gradual increases may be sufficient for anxiety effects, when compared with the higher doses of tiagabine used in epilepsy treatment. Tiagabine may be useful in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.",

    "45": "In an observational study, twenty-one ambulatory subjects with DSM-IV defined bipolar I/II disorder, in any phase of the illness, openly received adjunctive risperidone or olanzapine. The primary efficacy parameters were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and the Maier and Philips Severity Subscale. Secondary efficacy parameters included the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) along with the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI). Response was defined as a significant change from baseline to endpoint in the total mean HDRS-17 score. The primary tolerability parameters were the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) along with changes in weight and body mass index (BMI-kg/m2). Patients were evaluated prospectively with repeated monthly assessments for up to 6 months.", 
    "46": "Eleven patients openly received risperidone; 10 received olanzapine adjunctive to either lithium or divalproex. Total mean HDRS-17 scores significantly decreased from baseline to endpoint in both groups (p=0.001), with the mean HDRS-17 total scores falling from 17(SD=3.2) to 5(SD=1.5) by 6 months in the risperidone-treated group and from 18 (SD=1.9) to 7 (SD=2.0) in the olanzapine-treated group. Differences between the risperidone-treated group and the olanzapine-treated group were not significant at 6 months (p=0.754). The mean doses of study medication were 2.88 (SD=1.6) mg/day for the risperidone-treated group and 12.69 (SD=2.3) mg/day for the olanzapine-treated group. Both risperidone and olanzapine were generally well tolerated. No patients developed tardive dyskinesia. Significant weight gain was experienced by patients in both groups [mean weight gain at endpoint was 5.9 kg in risperidone (p=0.023) and 11.3 kg in olanzapine (p=0.001)]. There was a significant difference in weight gain between the risperidone-treated group and the olanzapine-treated group (p=0.001).", 
    "47": "These pilot data, from the first prospective comparison study of risperidone and olanzapine in bipolar disorder, suggest that adjunctive administration of either agent may reduce depressive symptom severity. No subjects receiving risperidone or olanzapine developed tardive dyskinesia. Both compounds imparted substantial weight gain with significantly more weight gain accrual with olanzapine. As this was an observational study, the antidepressant effect and tolerability profile of these compounds requires validation via double-blind placebo controlled investigations.",

In some cases the vital prognosis can be involved. The evaluation of the syndrome's severity is based on certificated scales. The mortality has been reduced by the improved management of these neonates. Diamorphine, phenobarbital, chlorpromazine and diazepam are the most currently used. However, there is no consensus on the treatment. The data concerning the treatment are controversial, especially for the use of diazepam. The aim of our study was to describe the effects of diazepam obtained in three different centers and to compare our results to those of the literature.",

PBR ligands inhibited the proliferation of HCC cell lines by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis was characterized by a breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation and nuclear degradation. Furthermore, pro-apoptotic Bax was overexpressed while anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) were suppressed. Cell cycle was arrested both at the G1/S- and G2/M-checkpoints. Synergistic anti-neoplastic effects were obtained by a combination of PBR ligands with cytostatic drugs (paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin), or with an experimental Bcl-2 inhibitor.",

The ability of Et743 to block DNA replication was studied using the well-established simian virus (SV40) model for mammalian DNA replication in cells and cell-free extracts. Intracellular SV40 DNA isolated from Et743-treated BSC-1 cells was analyzed by native, two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis. A low frequency of Et743 adducts detected at 30-100 nM drug concentrations inhibited SV40 origin activity and induced formation of unusual DNA replication intermediates. Under cell-free conditions, only a high Et743 adduct frequency reduced SV40 DNA synthesis. Comparative studies involving related DNA alkylators, tomamycin and saframycin A, revealed inhibition of SV40 DNA replication in cells at concentrations approximately 10 times higher than Et743. Under cell-free conditions tomamycin- or saframycin-A-adducted DNA templates inhibited DNA synthesis similarly to Et743. Et743 appears to be unusual among other alkylators, because its adducts strongly inhibit intracellular SV40 DNA replication but are relatively weak as cis inhibitors as measured under cell-free conditions.",

The oximes in combination with atropine and diazepam are an integral part of the treatment of acute intoxications with organophosphate. Treatment with atropine, which relieves the muscarinic effects of acetylcholine and anticonvulsive agents (diazepam) is well established. However, the effectiveness of oxime compounds in counteracting the effect of intoxication in still a matter of debate. Based on literature reports, opinions are presented concerning the role of oximes in the treatment of intoxications by various OP.",

The fuzzy simulations method consists of (i) representing parameter uncertainty and variability by fuzzy numbers and (ii) simulating predictions by solving the pharmacokinetic model. The fuzzy-probabilistic approach includes an additional transformation between fuzzy numbers and probability density functions. To illustrate the proposed method a diazepam WBPBPK model was used where the information for hepatic intrinsic clearance determined by in vitro-in vivo scaling was semi-quantitative. The predicted concentration time profiles were compared with those resulting from a Monte Carlo simulation. Fuzzy simulations can be used as an alternative to Monte Carlo simulation.",

    "63": "Many psychiatric illnesses, including chronic schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and dementia, are characterized by episodes of acute agitation, making administration of oral agents difficult or impossible. Ziprasidone, the first atypical antipsychotic available in both intramuscular (IM) and oral formulations, has demonstrated significant control of acute agitation within 15 minutes, as seen in two 24-hour studies in patients with schizophrenia. Improvement was maintained for > or = 4 hours, and a low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, and dystonia as well as no excessive sedation were observed Also, two 7-day studies (n = 132 and n = 306) and one 6-week study (n = 567) of sequential IM/oral ziprasidone versus IM/oral haloperidol in patients with psychotic disorders found IM ziprasidone more effective than IM haloperidol within 3 days of IM treatment; both drugs produced further comparable improvements in efficacy parameters after transition to oral therapy. IM ziprasidone was associated with a lower incidence of movement disorders than was haloperidol in all of these studies. Overall, discontinuations were similar for IM ziprasidone and haloperidol in the comparative trials, including the sequential IM/oral studies. However, in the 6-week sequential IM/oral trial, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse events was twice as high among haloperidol vs ziprasidone patients. This report focuses on the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and tolerability of IM ziprasidone, and provides an overview of the utility of other commonly used antipsychotics in the management of acute psychotic agitation.",

Thirty-seven patients were randomized with 20 in the sertraline and clonazepam group and 17 in the sertraline and placebo groups. Male and female outpatients, age 18-65 years, met criteria for a primary diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder according to DSM-IV, as determined by the structured clinical MINI interview. Appropriate safety and efficacy parameters were measured throughout the study. The determination of efficacy was based primarily on changes from baseline to the last observation taken through week 12. Analysis revealed no significant difference between groups at endpoint on the main scale.", 
    "65": "Insomnia is a frequent though rarely investigated problem among prisoners. The study's aim was to examine the clinical management of insomnia complaints in non-substance-misusing (NSM) prisoners (quality of medical consultation, effectiveness of drug prescription), and the risk of leaving prison with ongoing hypnotic prescription which might provoke withdrawal symptoms and encourage further hypnotic use outside prison.", 
    "66": "Retrospective study of the medical records of 112 NSM prisoners complaining of insomnia at medical consultation over a one year period at the outpatient-service of the Champ-Dollon remand prison (Geneva, Switzerland). We examined insomnia management by the general practitioners (anamnestic and clinical evaluation documented in the record), type, duration and effectiveness of treatment.", 
    "67": "The 112 records show a prescription of hypnotics to 111 patients (80% benzodiazepines or Zolpidem), a limited documented insomnia work-up (anamnestic information about sleep habits, sleep latency and previous hypnotic use for less than a third of the patients, about the impact of insomnia, such as fatigue, on daily activity in only 7%). In more than 60% of the patients, insomnia complaints persisted for more than 3 weeks. In 41 (37%) patients, improvement (defined subjectively based on patients' complaints) was complete, in 20 (18%) absent, and in 34 (30%) incomplete while taking the prescribed hypnotics. Patients without or with only partial improvement of insomnia received the highest number of hypnotics (mean 2.4, vs. 1.4 for patients with total improvement, 95% CI of the difference: 0.7-1.4). 55% of the 112 prisoners left prison with hypnotics still being prescribed.", 
    "68": "Our results show that prison physicians' evaluation for insomnia was incomplete. Drug prescription did not seem to have been an effective treatment for insomnia complaints in a sizeable number of patients. Many prisoners leave the prison with benzodiazepine prescription still ongoing and could be at risk for continued hypnotic use following imprisonment.", 
    "69": "Preemptive analgesia is currently in use in the management of postoperative pain and no more under search. The administration of ketamine as intraoperative analgesic agent is well-known since a long time; the analgesic properties of this drug are related to its actions as a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors antagonist; these receptors present an excitatory function on pain transmission and this binding seems to prevent or reverse the central sensitisation of every kind of pain, including postoperative pain. In literature, the use of this anesthetic for the preemptive analgesia in the management of postoperative pain is controversial; for this reason the aim of our study was the clinical evaluation of preemptive perioperative analgesia with low-doses ketamine.", 
    "70": "This trial involved 40 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, with the same surgical operator; postoperative analgesia was performed with the intraoperative administration of ketamine (0.7 mg/kg) or tramadol (15 mg/kg). A randomized, double-blind study was performed; after an inhalatory/analgesic general anesthesia (sevofluorane + remifentanyl) the postoperative-pain control was clinically evaluated through algometric measurements (Visual Analog Scale, Verbal Rating Scale, Pain Intensity Difference); supplemental doses of tramadol were administered if required, also to quantify the adequacy of analgesia, and adverse effects were evaluated.", 
    "71": "The results show that preemptive intraoperative analgesia with ketamine produces a good analgesia at the awakening, despite low duration (approximately 1 hour), and upgrades the analgesic effect of tramadol in the postoperative period. Among the adverse effects, some (for example nausea) were related to the administration of both analgesics and to the kind of surgery, others (hallucinosis, nystagmus, photophobia, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms) were due to ketamine, and others (respiratory depression and hypotension) could be related to tramadol. Although the adverse effects due to ketamine are more numerous than those related to tramadol, the second could potentially be more dangerous.", 
    "72": "Our study suggests that preemptive low-doses ketamine is able to produce an adequate postoperative analgesia and increases the analgesic effect of tramadol; furthermore, ketamine adverse effects could be reduced by intraoperative administration of benzodiazepines and/or antiemetic drugs, or by the association of ketamine and a peripheral analgesic (ketorolac).", 
    "73": "Impairments in memory and psychomotor function appear to be induced by benzodiazepines not only after long-term use, but also after administration of a single dose. Because it is known on which neurotransmitter system the benzodiazepines exert their action, the use of a quantitative radioreceptor assay (RRA) can be a useful tool in studying the interrelationship between the neurochemical and memory processes. The RRA measures the sum of the main compound(s) and all active metabolites present, where it relates the biological activity to the pharmacodynamic effect instead of relating it to the plasma levels of the individual compounds. To correlate the loss of memory with the benzodiazepine concentration, plasma concentrations were determined in suicidal patients. From suicidal patients (n = 84), the benzodiazepines in plasma were measured with a direct radioreceptor assay using tritiated flunitrazepam as the labelled ligand. The receptor material was a lyophilized preparation from calf cortex. Furthermore, the samples were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis, and the HPLC data were converted to diazepam equivalents using cross-reactivities of the individual compounds. Patients who had ethanol residues in their plasma were excluded from this correlation experiment. The data (n = 40) obtained with the two analytical techniques were compared and correlated to assess the validity of the radioreceptor assay in establishing the relationship between the loss of memory and the total amount of benzodiazepines present. The cumulative amount of diazepam determined with the RRA and the sum of compounds determined with the HPLC method, after correction using the cross-reactivities, were plotted and correlated using regression analysis. Regression analysis showed an x variable of 0.75 and a correlation coefficient of 0.67. The intercept was not significantly different from zero (P = 0.49, t-test), whereas the slope was significantly different from zero (P < 0.01). Benzodiazepines can be directly determined in plasma using this radioreceptor assay. The data obtained from HPLC analysis were easily converted to diazepam equivalents using the cross-reactivities. A discrepancy between the data obtained from the two analytical techniques, however, indicates that certain metabolites are present, which were not quantitated in the HPLC analysis, but were measured in the radioreceptor assay. Therefore, the radioreceptor assay proved to be a valuable tool for the assessment of clinical effects, such as the demonstration of the loss of memory in suicidal patients after a benzodiazepine overdose.", 
    "74": "The use of a drug to modify a person's behavior for criminal gain is not a recent phenomenon. However, the recent increase in reports of drug-facilitated crimes (sexual assault, so-called DFSA, robbery) has caused alarm in the general public. Drugs used can be difficult to detect (active products at low dosages, chemical instability), possess amnesic properties, and can be quickly cleared from body fluids. In case of long delay between the alleged crime and clinical examination, collection of blood or even urine can be of little value. This is the reason why this laboratory developed an original approach based on hair testing by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. To explore the detectability of a single absorption of bromazepam in hair, two volunteers (male and female) received a 6-mg dose. A strand of hair was sampled about one month after exposure and was cut into three segments of 2-cm long. After pulverization, 20 mg of hair was incubated overnight in a phosphate buffer (pH 8.4). The aqueous phase was extracted with 5 mL of a mixture of diethyl ether/methylene chloride (80:20) in the presence of diazepam-d5, which was used as internal standard (IS). Hair extract was separated on a XTerra MS C18 column using a gradient of acetonitrile and formate buffer. Detection was based on two daughter ions: transitions m/z 316.0 to 182.2 and 209.3 and m/z 290.1 to 154.1 and 198.2 for bromazepam and the IS, respectively. In the hair of the two subjects, bromazepam was detected in the proximal segment at 0.8 and 4.7 pg/mg, respectively. Hair analysis was applied to four authentic criminal cases. In the two first cases, bromazepam tested positive in the corresponding hair segment at 5.7, and 10.3 pg/mg. In another case, head hair was sampled 19 weeks after the alleged offense, and its length (< 4 cm) did not allow analysis of the corresponding period. However, 4.1 pg/mg of bromazepam was quantified in the victim's pubic hair. In these three cases, concentrations were consistent with a single exposure to bromazepam. In the last case, bromazepam was detected at 15 pg/mg in the segment corresponding to the period of the alleged offence but also in the range 2 to 7 pg/mg in the four other consecutive segments, making a single exposure statement difficult.", 
    "75": "Lorazepam (Ativan), is a benzodiazepine frequently used to manage anxiety, presurgically, and as a sedative. Common side effects include sedation, dizziness, weakness, unsteadiness, and disorientation. Consequently, lorazepam can have a significant effect on driving ability. We reviewed all positive lorazepam drug-impaired driving cases submitted to the Washington State Toxicology Laboratory between January 1998 and December 2003. The mean concentration found in the blood of these drivers (n = 170) was 0.048 mg/L (std. dev. = 0.06, median = 0.03). Concentrations ranged from < 0.005 to 0.39 mg/L. Eighty-six percent of these drivers tested positive for other drugs in addition to lorazepam that may have contributed to their impairment. There were 23 cases in which lorazepam was the only drug detected. The mean concentration found in the blood of these drivers was 0.051 mg/L (median = 0.03, range < 0.01-0.38). This population was 56% male, with a mean age of 39.5 years, (range 16-72). We obtained Drug Recognition Expert reports containing details of events surrounding arrest and performance on field sobriety tests for 10 of the remaining cases in which no drugs other than lorazepam were present. Lorazepam concentrations in these cases averaged 0.050 mg/L (median = 0.04, range 0.01-0.13 mg/L). This review of these subjects indicates that lorazepam is capable of causing significant impairment to driving and psychomotor abilities, independent of the concentration detected.", 
    "76": "A study of the urinary concentration of fentanyl (F) and its major metabolite norfentanyl (NF) in chronic pain patients treated with the Duragesic continuous release transdermal patches is presented. These patches are available in 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm(2) sizes releasing 25, 50, 75, and 100 microg/h F, respectively. F is rapidly and extensively metabolized, with NF as the major metabolite. Five hundred-forty six random urine specimens were collected from chronic pain patients wearing 25, 50, 75, or 100 ug F transdermal patches. Urine specimens were collected from hours after application to several days later after continuous F release. Each specimen was analyzed for F, NF, creatinine, and pH. Additionally, each was screened by enzyme immunoassay for the following: amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine metabolite, methadone, phencyclidine, d-propoxyphene, opiates, and marijuana metabolites. All positive screening results were confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). F and NF were isolated from urine by solid-phase extraction then identified and quantified by GC-MS in SIM mode. The LODs and LOQs for F and NF were 3 ng/mL, respectively. The results of F and NF analysis of urine form those wearing 25-microg patches (N = 142) was mean F, 47 ng/mL with a range of 0 to 983 ng/mL, and 97% of the specimens contained < 200 ng/mL and mean NF, 175 ng/mL with a range of 0-980 ng/mL, while 95% of the specimens contained < 400 ng/mL. The results of F and NF analysis of urine form those wearing 50 microg patches (N = 184) was: mean F, 74 ng/mL with a range of 0 to 589 ng/mL, and 92% of the specimens contained < 200 ng/mL and mean NF, 257 ng/mL with a range of 0-2200 ng/mL, and 98% of the specimens contained < 1000 ng/mL. The results of F and NF analysis of urine form those wearing 75 microg patches (N = 85) was mean F, 107 ng/mL with a range of 0 to 1280 ng/mL, and 98% of the specimens contained < 400 ng/mL and mean NF, 328 ng/mL with a range of 0-5630 ng/mL, and 99% of the specimens contained < 1000 ng/mL. The results of F and NF analysis of urine form those wearing 100 ug patches (N = 135) was mean F, 100 ng/mL with a range of 0 to 1080 ng/mL, while 96% of the specimens contained < 400 ng/mL and mean NF, 373 ng/mL with a range of 0-5730 ng/mL, and 95% of the specimens contained < 1000 ng/mL. The incidence of other drugs detected as a percentage the specimens was opiates, 48%, benzodiazepines, 43%; barbiturates, 3%; methadone, 4%; marijuana metabolite, 3%; and cocaine metabolite, 1%. With the exception of F and/or NF, no other drugs were detected in 25% of the specimens. These data demonstrate the wide variation in concentrations of F and NF in random urine specimens following application of Duragesic patches. However, these values obtained during therapeutic use far exceed concentrations previously reported in fatal poisoning. In general, one may expect to find urine NF concentrations 3-4 times higher than those of F.", 
    "77": "The objective of this study was to develop a screening process for the analysis of sexual assault samples. Recently, the Society of Forensic Toxicologists created a committee to address the issue of drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA) in the toxicology field. This committee prepared a list of drugs that could be, or have been, used in DFSAs. The list comprises about 50 compounds, including illicit, prescription, and over-the-counter drugs. Using this list, our laboratory wanted an easy, fast, and sensitive method to analyze a urine sample for all 50 of these drugs. We screened and confirmed for 20 compounds, including cocaine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, opiates, methadone, alcohol, and PCP. A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric screening method that was able to detect the remaining 30 compounds following 1 extraction and using only 2 mL of urine was developed. The process is inexpensive and uses equipment available in most forensic toxicology laboratories. This method is recommended for any laboratory that commonly receives specimens collected from sexual assault victims and is interested in a more thorough analysis.", 
    "78": "A 26-year-old female with intractable epileptic seizures was studied with I-123 iomazenil cerebral benzodiazepine receptor, I-123 IMP inter-ictal and Tc-99m ECD ictal cerebral blood flow SPECT. The ictal cerebral blood flow SPECT indicated the location of the seizures to be in the left temporal lobe, where increased regional cerebral blood flow was noted in marked contrast to the inter-ictal SPECT. Ictal electroencephalograms (EEGs) recorded with scalp and sphenoidal electrodes also suggested the left temporal lobe as the location of the seizures. On I-123 iomazenil SPECT, however, decreased benzodiazepine receptor density was demonstrated in the right temporal lobe. MRI showed mild atrophy and abnormal signal intensity in the right temporal lobe. Ictal EEGs recorded with intracranial electrodes revealed that abnormal electrical activity of the brain always emerged from the right temporal lobe and then propagated to the contralateral side. Based on the findings of intracranial EEGs, partial resection of the right anterior temporal lobe including hippocampus was performed. After the surgery, no seizure occurred. Pathological examination of the surgical specimens revealed hippocampal sclerosis. This case suggested that cerebral benzodiazepine receptor imaging with I-123 iomazenil can be helpful for correct localization of epileptogenic foci.", 
    "79": "Common adverse effect measures in psychiatric trials are typically analysed with repeated measures ANOVA, despite having distributions which violate key assumptions of that method; moreover, some adverse effects may be concentrated in vulnerable subgroups of participants. For testing treatment differences in adverse effects, we propose use of Kendall's taub as a summary measure of within-participant trends in adverse events, in conjunction with a weighted modification of a rank test proposed by Conover and Salsburg. Data on extrapyramidal side effects from a controlled clinical trial conducted in persons with treatment resistant schizophrenia was used to compare the proposed analysis to repeated measures ANOVA using mixed models and alternate tests for treatment differences in taub trend scores.", 
    "80": "Antennal sensory neurons of Manduca sexta emerge from epidermal cells that also give rise to sheath cells surrounding the peripheral parts of the neurons and to glial cells that enwrap the sensory axons in the antennal nerve. Reciprocal interactions between sensory neurons and glial cells are believed to aid in axon growth and guidance, but the exact nature of these interactions is not known. We investigated the possibility of cholinergic interactions in this process by locating muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) enzyme in cultured antennal sensory neurons and non-neural cells. ChAT and mAChRs were present in the sensory neurons from the first day in culture. Therefore, the sensory neurons are probably cholinergic, as previously suggested, but they may also be controlled by ACh. In 7-day-old cultures a subgroup of small non-neural cells with processes expressed ChAT activity, and in 14-day-old cultures non-neural cells that formed lamellipodia and scaffoldlike structures on the culture substrate were labeled with ChAT antibody. mAChR activity was detected in similar non-neural cells but only in areas surrounding the nuclei. In addition, mAChRs were found in flat lamellipodia and filopodia forming cells that were present in 1-day-old cultures and grew in size during the 2 week investigation period. These findings suggest muscarinic cholinergic interactions between the neural and non-neural cells during the development of Manduca antenna.", 
    "81": "Organophosphorus compounds are worldwide employed as insecticides and are yearly responsible of several millions of poisonings. The chemical structure of most of the warfare nerve agents also corresponds with an organophosphorus compound. Organophosphorus insecticides and warfare nerve agents exert their main toxicological effects through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Current treatments of patients poisoned with organophosphorus compounds include atropine (in order to protect muscarinic receptors), oximes (in order to accelerate the reactivation of the inhibited acetylcholinesterase) and benzodiazepines (in order to avoid convulsions). The administration of phosphotriesterases (enzymes involved in the detoxication of organophosphorus compounds through hydrolysis) is a very effective treatment against poisonings by organophosphorus insecticides and warfare nerve agents. There are experimental preventive treatments based on the simultaneous administration of carbamates and certain antimuscarinic drugs, different from atropine, which notably improve the efficacy of the classical treatments applied after poisonings by warfare nerve agents.", 
    "82": "The treatments based in the administration of phosphotriesterases might be the response to the call of the World Health Organization for searching new treatments with capability to reduce the high mortality recorded in the cases of poisonings by organophosphorus compounds. These treatments can be applied in a preventive way without the intrinsic neurotoxicity associated to the preventive treatments based on carbamates and antimuscarinic drugs. Therefore, these treatments are specially interesting for people susceptible to suffer severe exposures, i.e. sprayers in the farms.", 
    "83": "To evaluate the mechanisms by which cholecystokinin (CCK) regulates the exocrine pancreas, the role and location of CCK receptors in the pig were investigated using the CCK-B receptor antagonist YF476 and different administration routes of CCK.", 
    "84": "In 11 anaesthetized pigs, catheters were surgically implanted in the pancreatic duct for juice collection, and in the gastric arteries and jugular vein, so that infusions of CCK-33 could be directed to the duodenal/gastric, duodenal/pancreatic or general circulations, respectively. Experiments were performed under control conditions, and after pretreatment by gavage feeding with YF476, using either a single, low dose of 0.3 micromol kg, which would block the CCK-B receptors, or a 1000 times higher dose (300 micromol kg), which would also block the CCK-A receptors.", 
    "85": "The increase in the pancreatic output of protein and the enzymes trypsin and amylase observed after the infusion of CCK-33 at 13 pmol kg to the duodenum/stomach or duodenum/pancreas was inhibited by pretreatment with YF476 at both dosages. In contrast, the increase in protein and enzyme output after the infusion of a supraphysiological dose of CCK-33 (130 pmol kg) to the general circulation was not affected by pretreatment with low dosage YF476, whereas high dosage YF476 completely inhibited the stimulated secretion.", 
    "86": "These data indicate that CCK-33 given locally to the duodenum in doses raising CCK to physiological plasma levels stimulates the pancreatic enzyme secretion via duodenal CCK-B receptors. Supra-physiological doses of CCK-33 to the general circulation appeared to affect the pancreatic enzyme secretion via CCK-A receptors located elsewhere than in the pancreatic and duodenal tissue.", 
    "87": "Farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs) are a novel class of anti-cancer agents that competitively inhibit farnesyl protein transferase (FTase). Initially developed to inhibit the prenylation necessary for Ras activation, their mechanism of action seems to be more complex, involving other proteins unrelated to Ras. FTIs have been developed and tested across a wide range of human cancers. At least 3 agents within this family have been investigated in hematologic malignancies. These are tipifarnib (R115777, Zarnestra), lonafarnib (SCH66336, Sarasar), both of which are orally administered, and BMS-214662, which is given intravenously. Preliminary results from clinical trials demonstrate enzyme target inhibition, a favorable toxicity profile and promising efficacy. Ongoing studies will better determine their mechanism of action and the role of combination with other agents, defining their place in the therapeutic arsenal of hematologic disorders.",

Maprotiline was used in the control group of 31 cases. After the treatment, the scores in HAMD for both groups were found to be obviously decreased as compared with those before the treatment (P < 0.01), without significant between-group differences (P > 0.05). The total effective rate in the treatment group was 96.7%, and that of the control group was 90.3%, showing no significant between-group differences (P > 0.05). After the treatment, the two groups all showed obvious decrease in the TCM symptomatic integrals (P < 0.01), with significant between-group differences (P < 0.05), the integral of the treatment group showing obvious superiority to that of the control group. And the decrease of the Asberg scores testing the side effect of antidepressants of the treatment group was obviously superior to that of the control group. After the treatment, the cortisol (CORT) content and the endothelin-1 (ET-1) content of the two groups were all obviously decreased (P < 0.01), and basically turned to normal, without significant between-group differences (P > 0.05).",

    "100": "Although detoxification cannot, in itself, be considered a treatment for addiction, it is one of the most pivotal phases. In order to facilitate entry into recovery and/or rehabilitation programs, a detoxification treatment has to be experienced as easy and safe by the patient. In consideration of the many inconveniences related to standard withdrawal treatments, there is an interest in developing alternative pharmacological strategies. The main rationales for using anticonvulsants in substance-abuse patients are their lack of addiction potential, evidence support a role of kindling mechanisms in withdrawal syndromes and their efficacy in comorbid psychiatric disorders. The available data currently support the utilization of carbamazepine as a treatment for detoxification from benzodiazepines, alcohol and opiates, and as a useful agent to reduce cocaine consumption. The use of valproate is well corroborated for alcohol detoxification and it seems to be a promising treatment for the reduction of cocaine use; however, it has been found to be ineffective against benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms. Some preliminary data suggest that lamotrigine could be useful in opiate and cocaine dependence. Gabapentin shows potential as a treatment for cocaine dependence, and some case reports have stimulated interest in this agent for alcohol and benzodiazepine detoxification. Due to its particular pharmacological profile, topiramate is one of the most interesting newer anticonvulsants. It has been found to be efficacious in opiate and possibly benzodiazepine detoxification and also has theoretical potential as a preventive therapy.", 
    "101": "Adult neurogenesis is a newly considered form of plasticity that could contribute to brain dysfunction in psychiatric disease. Chronic alcoholism, a disease affecting over 8% of the adult population, produces cognitive impairments and decreased brain volumes, both of which are partially reversed during abstinence. Clinical data and animal models implicate the hippocampus, a region important in learning and memory. In a model of alcohol dependence (chronic binge exposure for 4 d), we show that adult neurogenesis is inhibited during dependence with a pronounced increase in new hippocampal neuron formation after weeks of abstinence. This increase is attributable to a temporally and regionally specific fourfold increase in cell proliferation at day 7 of abstinence, with a majority of those cells surviving and differentiating at percentages similar to controls, effects that doubled the formation of new neurons. Although increases in cell proliferation correlated with alcohol withdrawal severity, proliferation remained increased when diazepam (10 mg/kg) was used to reduce withdrawal severity. Indeed, those animals with little withdrawal activity still show a twofold burst in cell proliferation at day 7 of abstinence. Thus, alcohol dependence and recovery from dependence continues to alter hippocampal plasticity during abstinence. Because neurogenesis may contribute to hippocampal function and/or learning, memory, and mood, compensatory neurogenesis and the return of normal neurogenesis may also have an impact on hippocampal structure and function. For the first time, these data provide a neurobiological mechanism that may underlie the return of human cognitive function and brain volume associated with recovery from addiction.", 
    "102": "The aim of the study was to investigate whether the most recent introduced atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone were preferentially prescribed to patients susceptible to develop extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) and those not responding adequately to typical antipsychotics.", 
    "103": "Data were obtained from the Dutch PHARMO system that includes complete medication and hospital admission records of 675 000 residents of 14 Dutch cities. A total number of 129 new users of olanzapine and 142 new users of risperidone as well as 507 new users of typical antipsychotic drugs were identified from our database in the period of 1996-1998. The prevalence of markers of EPS, therapy resistance and therapy non-compliance were assessed in the period of 1 year prior to a new start of an antipsychotic.", 
    "104": "New use of olanzapine and risperidone was significantly associated with previous use of other antipsychotics (odds ratio 4.0, 95%CI: 2.5-6.7 and odds ratio 3.0, 95%CI: 2.0-4.7, respectively). New use of olanzapine and risperidone was also associated with previous use of anticholinergic drugs compared to users of typical antipsychotics (over three and two times more, respectively). This effect diminished when adjusted for previous use of antipsychotics.", 
    "105": "In particular olanzapine and also risperidone were selectively prescribed to patients formerly treated with other antipsychotics and to those susceptible for EPS. If not recognised or controlled for, observational studies comparing different antipsychotic drugs may produce biased results on efficacy or frequency of side effects for the different types of antipsychotics.", 
    "106": "To investigate the risk of falls associated with drugs among the French population using data reported to the French spontaneous reporting system and recorded in the French Pharmacovigilance database.", 
    "107": "All cases including a fall were searched in the French Pharmacovigilance database between 1995 and 1999. Drugs involved and characteristics of patients were investigated. In a second step, we estimated the risk associated with psychotropic and cardiovascular drugs in a case/non case comparison, where cases were reports including a fall and non cases all other reports. This risk was estimated by calculation of crude and age and gender adjusted reporting odds ratios (ROR).", 
    "108": "During this period, 328 reports including a fall were reported (0.4% of the database). Patients were female in 70%. Mean age was 76 +/- 18 years. Comparisons between cases and non cases showed that cases were more likely to be women (OR: 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.5-2.4]) and older. After adjustment on age and gender, falls remained significantly associated with exposure to benzodiazepines (4.7 [3.7-5.9]), imipraminic antidepressants (3.6 [2.5-5.1]), serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressants (2.2 [1.5-3.1]) or nitrates (1.9 [1.2-2.8]).", 
    "109": "This study confirms that taking psychotropic drugs strongly increases the risk of falls. The role of cardiovascular drugs (except nitrates) remains not significant when confounding factors are taken into account. According to the very high prevalence of psychotropic drug use in the French elderly, further study are needed to investigate the relative effect of some drugs on falls, like for example SRIs or short acting benzodiazepines.",

Many anticancer therapies work by inducing breaks in DNA, if unrepaired these can lead to cell death. As PARP promotes DNA repair there is a strong rational to suggest that its inhibition may increase the efficiency of certain cytotoxic treatments. This review discusses the advances made in PARP inhibitor design and the mechanism by which they enhance anti-tumour therapies.", 
    "111": "Diazepam is an important drug from the group of benzodiazepines, used in clinical practice for its sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsive, myorelaxant, and primarily anxiolytic effects. Several kinetic studies have been published which show that diazepam is a drug sensitive to hydrolysis both in acid and alkaline media. The present study aimed to elaborate and validate a simple and rapid HPLC/UV method for simultaneous analysis of three decomposition products of diazepam in the presence of diazepam and to apply it also on the control of stability of the injectional solution of diazepam. The optimization of chromatographic conditions resulted in the use of the high-performance chromatographic column Zorbax ODS, the mobile phase represented by a mixture of acetonitrile/water in a ratio of 60/40 (w/w, %), flow rate 1.5 ml/min, and spectrophotometric detection at 242 nm. The elaborated method and the employed chromatographic system were successfully validated and they can be used in practice in the control of stability of injection solution of diazepam.", 
    "112": "From their introduction in the psychiatric clinic, benzodiazepines have meant a great advance in the treatment of numerous pathologies, due to their therapeutic effectiveness and safety. Despite the consensus that indicates the rational use of this medication, it is much too frequently that actual practice does not conform with said criteria. We believed it necessary to conduct a revision regarding the prescription of benzodiazepines in our institution. For that purpose, we carried out a retrospective study using 130 medical histories trough a three-year period, analyzing the indication and duration of benzodiazepine usage. Consequently, we are able to affirm that the use of benzodiazepine, in relation to diagnosis and duration of usage, is not made according to international guidelines.", 
    "113": "Anxiety as a symptom is very frequent in alcoholic patients and the comorbidity between alcoholism and anxiety disorders is very high. One of the reasons is the reciprocal implication between both pathologies. Habitually, it is better to treat both disorders at the same time, specially panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. We must be cautious with the use of benzodiazepines. Generally we must prefer SSRI and other drugs.", 
    "114": "Benzodiazepines are effective and widely used in anxiety disorders, but they produce sedation and dependency. Molecular studies have shown that binding benzodiazepines to GABAA receptors containing the Alpha1 subunit mediates the sedative properties of benzodiazepines. Other strategies are being developed including the use of the selective GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine and the voltage gated calcium ion channel ligand pregabalin. Several novel strategies are being developed based on preclinical observations, including corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) antagonists, substance P antagonists, and drugs inhibiting glutamate neurotransmission.", 
    "115": "Either as a symptom or as a trait of an axis I disorder, anxiety is frequently associated with depressive episodes. Its treatment depends mainly of the syndrome in which it is included. While the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to be indicated in depression with comorbid anxiety disorders and in anxious depression, in agitated depression may be preferable to indicate mood stabilizers or sedative antipsychotics. Benzodiazepines may be useful at the beginning of the treatment of these special forms of depression, but it is advisable to tapper them off once the affective and/or the anxiety disorders improve.", 
    "116": "We report on the case of an 86-year-old woman who rapidly became unable to stand and walk because of jerky movements, suggesting a clinical diagnosis of myoclonus. It was observed that both unexpected and expected stimuli (audiogenic, tactile, or visual) triggered the myoclonic jerks. Electrophysiological exploration, including a coupled EEG-EMG study, showed the occurrence of a patterned motor response to each stimulation (whatever the modality), consisting of eye blinking, head flexion, abduction of the upper arms, movement of the trunk, and bending of the knees. Given the absence of any relevant past history and lack of biological or neurological abnormalities including on CT scan brain imaging, the diagnosis of late-onset hyperekplexia was suggested. Substantial abatement of the clinical symptomatology was obtained after introduction of low-dose clonazepam.", 
    "117": "Clonidine administration in the setting of paediatric anaesthesia is associated with a number of desirable effects, e.g. preoperative sedation, analgesia and reduced anaesthetic requirements. The aim of the current study was to compare postoperative outcome variables using a prospective, randomized, double-blind design after premedication with clonidine or midazolam.", 
    "118": "One hundred paediatric ASA physical status 1 patients (age 1-11 year) scheduled for adeno-tonsillectomy were assigned to receive rectal premedication with midazolam (300 microg kg(-1) and atropine 40 microg kg(-1); group M, n = 52) or clonidine (5 microg kg(-1 and) atropine 40 microg kg(-1); group C, n = 48) prior to a standardized sevoflurane anaesthetic. The incidence of immediate postoperative pain (0-2 h), as assessed by repeated Objective Pain Scale (OPS) scores, was chosen as the primary end-point of the study. Degree of sedation (modified Vancouver sedation scale 0-3), occurrence of postoperative vomiting (POV), and incidence of shivering and immediate postoperative confusion were registered as secondary end-points. After hospital discharge parents were instructed to continue the evaluation of pain, sedation, POV and sleep pattern during a 24-h period. Parents were also asked for their preference concerning the postoperative behaviour of their child (calm, sedated vs. alert, active).", 
    "119": "In the early postoperative period patients in the clonidine group had a significantly lower sum of 5 OPS scores (median = 8.0) compared to group M (median = 11.5) (P = 0.011). Administration of clonidine was also associated with a slightly higher sum of sedation scores (median = 13) in the early postoperative period compared to children receiving midazolam (median = 12) (P < 0.001). No episode of shivering was observed in the clonidine group but was present in five of the patients in the midazolam group (P = 0.057). In younger children (< 5 years) the incidence of postoperative confusion was lower in the clonidine group (P = 0.001). No difference in the frequencies of POV incidences, degree of postoperative pain, need for analgesics, or sleep pattern during the first 24 postoperative hours could be observed between the groups according to the parental evaluation. Children premedicated with clonidine were more calm and sedated compared to children in the midazolam group (P = 0.024) as judged by their parents. A significant majority of parents (75%; P < 0.001) preferred a calm and sedated child during the first postoperative 24-h period.", 
    "120": "Rectal premedication with clonidine was associated with a significant reduction of pain in the early postoperative period compared to midazolam and was also associated with moderately increased sedation during the first 24 postoperative hours. The sedative effect of clonidine is in agreement with the unambiguous finding of a parental preference for a calm and sedated child during the first 24 postoperative hours.", 
    "121": "Sevoflurane is a rapid-acting volatile anaesthetic agent frequently used in paediatric anaesthesia despite transient postoperative symptoms of cerebral excitation, particularly in preschool children.

    "129": "Allosteric interactions are important in many biological processes. They occur when the interactions of one substance with a binding agent changes the interactions of a second substance with the same agent at a separate site. Such interactions are often observed during the binding of drugs to blood proteins such as human serum albumin (HSA). Most previous studies of allosteric interactions have involved only qualitative observations of increased or decreased binding. In this study, we present an approach for quantitatively characterizing such allosteric effects using protein columns. The method is used to examine the interactions of ibuprofen/S-lorazepam acetate, S-oxazepam hemisuccinate/R-oxazepam hemisuccinate, and L-tryptophan/phenytoin during their binding to HSA. This approach can be applied to other receptors or biopolymers and can be used to independently examine the effects of two competing agents during an allosteric interaction.",

Narcotic and benzodiazepine sedation, such as is used for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), is known to decrease filling pressures. We hypothesized that lower filling pressure and wall stress associated with intravenous conscious sedation (IVCS) would lead to lower BNP levels.",

However, BNP levels increased (195 +/- 407 pg/mL vs 238 +/- 458; P < .01).", 
    "133": "In a series of patients undergoing clinically indicated TEE, BNP levels increase above baseline after IVCS. The increase in BNP occurs despite lower blood pressure, lower mitral Doppler E velocity, lower right ventricular/atrial gradient, and lower wall stress compared with baseline. The mechanism of the paradoxical increase in BNP is not entirely clear, but it may conceivably be a result of counterregulatory hormone release caused by acute decrease in blood pressure.", 
    "134": "The strategies to ensure safety during ventilation of an unprotected airway are limiting airway pressure and/or inspiratory flow. In this prospective, randomized study we assessed the effect of face mask ventilation with small tidal volumes in the modified mouth-to-bag resuscitator (maximal volume, 500 mL) versus a pediatric self-inflatable bag versus automatic pressure-controlled ventilation in 40 adult apneic patients during induction of anesthesia. The mouth-to-bag resuscitator requires the rescuer to blow up a balloon inside the self-inflating bag that subsequently displaces air which then flows into the patient's airway. Respiratory variables were measured with a pulmonary monitor (CP-100). Mouth-to-bag resuscitator and pressure-controlled ventilation resulted in significantly lower (mean +/- sd) peak airway pressure (8 +/- 2 and 8 +/- 1 cm H(2)O), peak inspiratory flow rate (0.7 +/- 0.1 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 L/s), and larger inspiratory time fraction (33% +/- 5% and 47% +/- 2%) in comparison to pediatric self-inflating bag ventilation (12 +/- 3 cm H(2)O; 1 +/- 0.2 L/s; 27% +/- 4%; all P < 0.001). The tidal volumes were similar between groups. No stomach inflation occurred in either group. We conclude that using a modified mouth-to-bag resuscitator or automatic pressure-controlled ventilation with similar small tidal volumes during face mask ventilation resulted in an approximately 25% reduction in peak airway pressure when compared with a standard pediatric self-inflating bag.", 
    "135": "Based on in vitro studies and animal data, most anesthetics are supposed to act via gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. However, this fundamental characteristic has not been extensively investigated in humans. We studied (11)C-flumazenil binding to GABA(A) receptors during sevoflurane and propofol anesthesia in the living human brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Fourteen healthy male subjects underwent 2 60-min dynamic PET studies with (11)C-labeled flumazenil, awake and during anesthesia. Anesthesia was maintained with 2% end-tidal sevoflurane (n = 7) or propofol at a target plasma concentration of 9.0 +/- 3.0 (mean +/- sd) microg/mL (n = 7). The depth of anesthesia was measured with bispectral index (BIS). Values of regional distribution volumes (DV) of (11)C-flumazenil were calculated in several brain areas using metabolite-corrected arterial plasma curves and a two-compartment model. Separate voxel-based statistical analysis using parametric DV images was performed for detailed visualization. The average BIS index was 35 +/- 6 in the sevoflurane group and 28 +/- 8 in the propofol group (P = 0.02). Sevoflurane increased the DV of (11)C-flumazenil significantly (P < 0.05) in all brain areas studied except the pons and the white matter. In the propofol group the increases were significant (P < 0.05) in the caudatus, putamen, cerebellum, thalamus and the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. Furthermore, the DV increases in the frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal cortical areas and in the putamen were statistically significantly larger in the sevoflurane than in the propofol group. Our findings support the involvement of GABA(A) receptors in the mechanism of action of both anesthetics in humans.", 
    "136": "With the exception of xenon, the interaction between muscle relaxants and inhaled anesthetics is known. We therefore compared the pharmacodynamics of rocuronium during xenon anesthesia versus a total IV anesthesia with propofol. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil in both the xenon and propofol groups (each n = 20). The xenon group received xenon via face mask until an end-expiratory concentration of 60% was maintained for 1 min. Meanwhile, the acceleromyograph (TOF-Watch SX(R)) was calibrated and a frequent train-of-four stimulation of the musculus adductor pollicis was started. After stabilization of the signal for 5 min, a single bolus of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium was injected. Anesthesia was maintained with xenon and remifentanil (xenon group) or with propofol and remifentanil (propofol group). There were no significant differences between the groups concerning the onset time (xenon group 125 +/- 33 and propofol group 144 +/- 43 s), duration (xenon group 33.2 +/- 10.8 and propofol group 32.6 +/- 8.4 min), recovery index (xenon group 9.4 +/- 6.6 and propofol group 8.4 +/- 5.3 min), and clinical recovery (xenon group 18.0 +/- 10.2 and propofol group 17.1 +/- 8.5 min). We conclude that the neuromuscular blocking effects of rocuronium are not different when given during propofol versus xenon anesthesia.",

In a series of 87 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, we studied the delay of recovery, incidence of residual paralysis, unwanted patient movement, and difficult surgical conditions after a single dose of atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) or cisatracurium (0.15 mg/kg). Anesthesia was induced with etomidate and remifentanil followed by tracheal intubation. The delay to obtain a train-of-four ratio of >0.9 was longer with cisatracurium than with atracurium (86 +/- 18 versus 97 +/- 19 min). However, at the end of surgery, this ratio was >0.9 for all patients. The presence of unwanted patient movement, diaphragmatic contractions, and difficult surgical conditions were observed. Delay of extubation of the trachea was similar in both groups. We conclude that there is no need for continuous neuromuscular blockade during cardiac surgery. A single dose of either atracurium or cisatracurium is sufficient to provide efficient paralysis from the start of induction leading to quicker recovery from paralysis in fast-track cardiac surgery.", 
    "138": "To study the effects of magnesium sulfate and/or valium in preventing local anesthetic toxicity induced by sacral block.", 
    "139": "A total of 240 adult patients scheduled for sacral block were randomized equally into four groups matched for sex, age and body weight. Ten minutes before sacral block, the patients in group B received valium (0.1 mg/kg), group C received magnesium sulfate (50 mg/kg), group D received both valium (0.1 mg/kg) and magnesium sulfate (50 mg/kg). The control (group A) received neither valium nor magnesium sulfate. Local anesthetic toxicity was observed and recorded in all the groups.", 
    "140": "Local anesthetic toxicity was significantly decreased in group B and group C compared with group A (P<0.05), and the toxicity was even more significantly decreased in group D(P<0.01 vs group A).", 
    "141": "Local anesthetic toxicity of sacral block can be significantly decreased by intravenous injection of valium or magnesium sulfate, and their combination produces stronger effects.", 
    "142": "We present the case of a 42-year-old woman with a 4-year history of definite multiple sclerosis (MS) and sustained contracture of the left hemiface with marked left deviation of the nose, deepened left nasolabial groove, narrowed palpebral fissure and weakness of the contracting muscles. Needle electromyography showed continuous resting activity of irregularly firing motor unit potentials (MUP) in the left orbicularis oculi (OO) and orbicularis oris, but not in the left frontalis. Simultaneous recording of maximal voluntary contraction of the OO on both sides showed marked preponderance on the right. Blink reflex findings were consistent with an injury in the pons, mainly in the vicinity of the left facial nucleus. A magnetic resonance imaging study showed multiple supra- and infra-tentorial white matter lesions, as well as multiple lesions at the level of the pons. Complete recovery was observed after 3 months. This condition has been described in cases of brainstem tumor as spastic paretic hemifacial contracture (SPHC). Up to now SPHC has not been explicitly associated with MS and, in this case, it could be arguably attributed to hyperexcitability of the facial neurons due to demyelination of the corticofacial fibers.", 
    "143": "The neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) has been implicated in fear and anxiety. CCK is found in the CNS in several molecular forms such as the tetrapeptide (CCK-4) and, mainly, the sulfated octapeptide (CCK-8s) fragments. Administration of CCK-4 induces panic attacks in humans and increases the expression of different anxiety-related behaviors in laboratory animals. The effects of CCK-8s on fear and anxiety are less straightforward and seem to be influenced, among other factors, by the route of the peptide administration and the animal model employed. In other to further investigate the role of CCK-8s in fear and anxiety, in the present study we analyzed the effect of CCK-8s in male Wistar rats submitted to the elevated T-maze. This animal model of anxiety was developed in order to separate generalized anxiety (inhibitory avoidance) and panic-like (escape) responses in the same rat. The effect of CCK-8s in this test was also investigated after injection of the peptide into the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG). This brainstem area is rich in CCK receptors and has consistently been implicated in the mediation of fear and anxiety responses. The results showed that both the intraperitoneal and intra-DPAG injections of CCK-8s potentiated one-way escape behavior, suggesting a panicogenic action. In contrast, the injection of the CCK2 receptor antagonist CR2945 inhibited the expression of this behavior, a panicolytic-like effect. Therefore, the elevated T-maze, in contrast to other animal models of anxiety, can detect the anxiety-eliciting effects of CCK-8s both after its systemic and central administration. Also, the results provide further evidence about the involvement of a CCK-mediated mechanism within the DPAG in the regulation of panic-related defensive behaviors.", 
    "144": "The effects of angelica essential oil in three assays predictive of anxiolytic activity in male mice were studied, with diazepam as a positive anxiolytic control. In the elevated plus-maze test, compared to the positive control diazepam, angelica essential oil (30.0 mg/kg, PO) had a modest anxiolytic-like effect (increased the percentage of open-arm time and reduced the percent protected head dips). In the light/dark test, angelica essential oil (30.0 mg/kg) prolonged the time spent in the light area without altering the locomotor activity of the animals. In the stress-induced hyperthermia test, 60 and 70 min after drug administration, rectal temperature was measured twice, angelica essential oil at the dose of 30.0 mg/kg inhibited stress-induced hyperthermia. Thus, these findings indicate that angelica essential oil, as does diazepam, exhibits an anxiolytic-like effect. Further studies will be required to assess the generality of the present findings to other species and behavioural paradigms.", 
    "145": "The effects of pharmacological manipulations on responding under extinction conditions were determined in baboons using a schedule of reinforcement that modeled food acquisition and food consumption. Responding during the initial acquisition component was reinforced by stimuli paired with food, while responding during the latter consumption component was reinforced with food. Certain sessions began with a 7-h extinction phase, where responding in both components produced only the paired stimuli. Dexfenfluramine (DFEN) decreased responding during extinction. Diazepam (DZP) increased responding during extinction. Low doses of amphetamine (AMPH) increased responding during extinction. Thus, DZP and AMPH increased and DFEN decreased the conditioned reinforcing effects of stimuli paired with food.", 
    "146": "Recent research using genetically modified mice has pointed to the specific contribution of individual receptor subtypes to the various effects of benzodiazepines. The aim of this study was to examine the relative significance of alpha(1)-containing GABA(A) receptors in the effects of modulators at the benzodiazepine site in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) under dim red light in rats. We tested the effects of the non-selective antagonist flumazenil (0-20.0 mg/kg), the preferential alpha(1)-subunit selective antagonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt, 0-30.0 mg/kg), the non-selective agonist midazolam (0-2.0 mg/kg), the preferential alpha(1)-subunit selective agonist zolpidem (0-2.0 mg/kg) and the non-selective inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM, 0-2.0 mg/kg). The influence of flumazenil (10.0 mg/kg) and beta-CCt (30.0 mg/kg) on the effects of both kinds of agonists were also examined. The standard spatio-temporal parameters reflecting anxiety (percentage of open arm entries and time) and locomotion (closed and total arm entries) were analyzed. beta-CCt did not affect behavior, while flumazenil at the highest dose (20.0 mg/kg) decreased indices of open arm activity and total arm entries. Midazolam at the dose of 1.0 mg/kg significantly increased the percentage of open arm time, whereas at 2.0 mg/kg both anxiety-related parameters were increased. In contrast to the open arm entries, the open arm time was independent of the decreased closed arm entries, observed at 2.0 mg/kg. Flumazenil abolished these effects, whereas beta-CCt partially potentiated the anxiolytic actions of midazolam. Zolpidem significantly increased both open-arm indices at 1.0 mg/kg, but the effect was dependent on the decreased closed arm entries. The selectivity of the anxiolytic-like effects of zolpidem was further checked under brighter white illumination. In these settings, the influence on anxiety-related, but not activity-related parameters, was absent. All of the activity-related effects of midazolam and zolpidem were mainly counteracted by both antagonists. DMCM produced significant anxiogenic effects at 1.0 mg/kg (open arm time) and 2.0 mg/kg (both parameters). beta-CCt (30.0 mg/kg) and flumazenil at higher dose (20.0 mg/kg) antagonized the effects of DMCM. The results indicate the anxiolytic effects of a non-selective benzodiazepine site agonist involve a predominant role of subunits other than alpha(1), whereas the behavioral indices of the anxiolytic-like properties of an alpha(1)-selective ligand, if observed, depend on the experimental settings and the changes in locomotor activity, and hence were behaviorally non-specific. The present results generally correspond well to the behavioral findings with the genetically modified mice. On the other hand, the relative significance of the alpha(1)-subunit in the anxiogenic effects of DMCM could not be clearly deduced.", 
    "147": "Our studies aimed at investigating whether the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, nifedipine, could prevent anxiogenic-like consequences of diazepam withdrawal in rats. Animals withdrawn from chronic diazepam (2 mg/kg/day i.p. for 2 weeks) drank significantly less water than did control rats in the unfamiliar arm of a Y maze. This anxiogenic-like effect could be prevented by acute administration of nifedipine (at 10 mg/kg i.p., but not at lower doses), which, on its own, did not change water intake in naive rats. Given chronically in combination with diazepam for the second half of a 2-week treatment with this drug, nifedipine (at the daily dose of 5 mg/kg i.p.) also suppressed the reduction of water intake normally observed on diazepam withdrawal. Biochemical measurements showed that acutely, as well as chronically, administered nifedipine increased 5-HT turnover in the hippocampus of diazepam-treated rats, thereby suggesting that the prevention of diazepam withdrawal-induced anxiogenic behaviour by the calcium antagonist might be underlain by serotoninergic mechanisms.", 
    "148": "There is in vitro evidence that some of the effects of abused volatile solvents may be produced by actions at the NMDA receptor. In addition, some solvents produce phencyclidine-like discriminative stimulus effects. The major goal of the present study was to further compare abused solvents to NMDA antagonists by testing them in two strains of mice trained to discriminate 0.17 mg/kg of the very selective uncompetitive NMDA antagonist, dizocilpine, from saline and contrast those results with several GABA(A)-positive modulators, PCP and ethanol. The results indicated that the discriminative stimulus produced by 0.17 mg/kg dizocilpine was highly specific in both mouse strains. PCP produced 91% dizocilpine-lever responding in C57BL/6J mice, but only 56% dizocilpine-lever responding in DBA/2J mice. Pentobarbital, midazolam and ethanol produced at least some overlap in discriminative stimulus effects with dizocilpine in one or both mouse strains. In contrast, toluene, 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCE), xylene and methoxyflurane produced saline-appropriate responding almost exclusively. These data indicate that, at least under the specific conditions tested, abused volatile solvents do not have substantial dizocilpine-like discriminative stimulus effects in either C57BL/6J or DBA/2J mice, providing little support that NMDA antagonism plays a central role in the production of this abuse-related effect.", 
    "149": "Paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines include restlessness, violent behavior, physical assault, act of self-injury and need for restraints. These may occur at variable times after administration. This study was designed to determine the incidence of paradoxical reactions following intravenous midazolam premedication in pediatric patients and to compare the efficacy of extra doses of midazolam with low-dose intravenous ketamine to rapidly tranquillize them.", 
    "150": "A total of 706 ASA I, II children scheduled for elective surgery were given intravenous midazolam premedication. Children who developed a paradoxical reaction were randomly divided into three equal groups to receive: (i) extra midazolam, (ii) ketamine, or (iii) placebo as the test drug for treatment of paradoxical reaction. Ease of rapid tranquillization and need for a rescue tranquillizer (i.e. ketamine; irrespective of patient group) were compared among the three groups.", 
    "151": "Twenty-four (3.4%) children developed paradoxical reaction after midazolam premedication. Those who received ketamine as the test drug responded rapidly to ketamine. But the responses of the other two groups to their test drug were poor and the majority of them required ketamine as rescue tranquillizer (six in midazolam, seven in placebo, but no patient in the ketamine group; P < 0.05).", 
    "152": "The results of this study demonstrate that ketamine is an effective drug for the treatment of paradoxical reaction following intravenous midazolam premedication. The exact mechanisms of these reactions and how it is aborted by ketamine are not clear.", 
    "153": "We studied the effect of lauric acid on transdermal penetration of phenazepam in vivo. It was found that treatment with lauric acid 3-fold increased the maximum anticonvulsive effect of phenazepam applied in a transdermal therapeutic system in comparison with the control. Study of the pharmacokinetics of phenazepam transdermal therapeutic system showed its higher bioavailability in the presence of lauric acid (f=0.9).", 
    "154": "The influence of stresses of various etiology (prolonged isolation, inescapable electrostimulation) on the antiaggressive effect of anxiolytics was studied in outbread white male rats. It was established that, in contrast to the anticonflict effect (decreasing under the action of stress), then antiaggressive action of the drugs studied (diazepam, phenazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam) exhibits qualitative changes. In the absence of stress, the threshold of aggressive reaction is low and anxiolytics increase this level. Under the action of stress, the threshold of aggressive reaction increases, and the same drugs reduce this threshold to the normal level, thus producing proaggressive action. The degree of changes and the rate of restoration of the initial activity depend on the efficacy of anxiolytics, the strength and duration of stress, and on the duration of drug administration during the stress aftereffect. A possible mechanism of this phenomenon can be the interaction of the GABA-benzodiazepine and opiate endogenous systems.", 
    "155": "Limited systematic data on herb-drug interaction are available, despite many opportunities to concomitant use of herb with prescribed drugs. We investigated the effects of 15 herbal extracts in dietary supplements on CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activities in human liver microsomes. Strong inhibition of these CYP activities was found by the addition of green tea extracts (GTE) or grape seed extracts (GSE) in vitro. To examine the effects of these extracts on CYP3A activities in vivo, the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (MDZ) was analyzed in rats. Although single treatments with these extracts had negligible effects, 1 week of treatment with them resulted in a significant increase in the ke of intravenously administered MDZ, indicating the induction of CYP3A in the liver. In contrast, 1 week of treatment with GTE, but not GSE, caused a significant increase in the C(max) and AUC(0-infinity) of orally administered MDZ without change in the t(1/2), suggesting a reduction in CYP3A activity in the small intestines. These studies indicate that subchronic ingestion of GTE or GSE may alter the pharmacokinetics of MDZ, and the effects of GTE on CYP3A activity appear opposite between liver and small intestine, which could not be predicted from in vitro experiments.", 
    "156": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate a contribution of polymorphic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 to the oxidation of diltiazem, midazolam and testosterone by liver microsomes from Japanese subjects. Twenty-seven liver samples were classified into three groups according to the CYP3A5 genotypes; CYP3A5(*)1/(*)1 (n=3), (*)1/(*)3 (n=12) and (*)3/(*)3 (n=12). The results of genotyping and immunochemical quantitation of CYP3A5 protein showed a good accordance between the CYP3A5 genotype and CYP3A5 content but not CYP3A4 content in liver microsomes. The expression levels of hepatic CYP3A5 protein ranged from 20 to 60% of the sum of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 contents in subjects with at least one wild type allele ((*)1). The CYP3A5 contents correlated well with liver microsomal activities of diltiazem N-demethylation, midazolam 1'- and 4-hydroxylations and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation among subjects carrying at least one (*)1 allele. In addition, the correlation coefficients of CYP3A5 contents with the rates of diltiazem N-demethylation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and testosterone 6beta- hydroxylation were higher than those of CYP3A4, although the value of CYP3A5 with the midazolam 4-hydroxylation rate was similar to that of CYP3A4. Kinetic analyses revealed a biphasic diltiazem N-demethylation in liver microsomes from subjects carrying the (*)1 allele. The apparent V(max)/K(m) values for recombinant CYP3A5 indicated the greater contributions to diltiazem N-demethylation and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation as compared with CYP3A4. These results suggest that polymorphic CYP3A5 contributes markedly to the drug oxidations, particularly diltiazem N-demethylation, midazolam 1'- hydroxylation and testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation by liver microsomes from Japanese subjects.", 
    "157": "Hormone-induced steroid biosynthesis begins with the transfer of cholesterol from intracellular stores into mitochondria. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) have been implicated in this rate-determining step of steroidogenesis. MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells were treated with and without oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) antisense to PBR and StAR followed by treatment with saturating concentrations of human choriogonadotropin. Treatment with ODNs antisense but not missense for both proteins inhibited the respective protein expression and the ability of the cells to synthesize steroids in response to human choriogonadotropin. Treatment of the cells with either ODNs antisense to PBR or a transducible peptide antagonist to PBR resulted in inhibition of the accumulation of the mature mitochondrial 30-kDa StAR protein, suggesting that the presence of PBR is required for StAR import into mitochondria. Addition of in vitro transcribed/translated 37-kDa StAR or a fusion protein of Tom20 (translocase of outer membrane) and StAR (Tom/StAR) to mitochondria isolated from control cells increased pregnenolone formation. Mitochondria isolated from cells treated with ODNs antisense, but not missense, to PBR failed to form pregnenolone and respond to either StAR or Tom/StAR proteins. Reincorporation of in vitro transcribed/translated PBR, but not PBR missing the cholesterol-binding domain, into MA-10 mitochondria rescued the ability of the mitochondria to form steroids and the ability of the mitochondria to respond to StAR and Tom/StAR proteins. These data suggest that both StAR and PBR proteins are indispensable elements of the steroidogenic machinery and function in a coordinated manner to transfer cholesterol into mitochondria.", 
    "158": "Fluoxetine and olanzapine combination therapy is rapidly becoming an effective strategy for managing symptoms of treatment-resistant depression. Determining drug-drug interactions, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics is of particular interest for revealing potential liabilities associated with drug augmentation in special patient populations. In the current studies, we chronically administered fluoxetine and olanzapine in non-stressed rats to extend our previous findings regarding body weight dynamics.", 
    "159": "Chronic fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) and olanzapine (5 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg) treatment decreased weight gain irrespective of olanzapine dosing. At the 10 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg dose, respectively, fluoxetine and olanzapine also significantly reduced food and water consumption. This pharmacodynamic event-related effect, however, was not observed at the 10 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg dosing paradigm suggesting differences in tolerability rates as a function of olanzapine dose. The decrease in weight gain was not associated with apparent changes in glucose metabolism as vehicle- and drug-treated rats showed undistinguishable serum glucose levels. The combination of fluoxetine and olanzapine in rats yielded drug plasma concentrations that fell within an expected therapeutic range for these drugs in psychiatric patients.", 
    "160": "These data suggest that fluoxetine and olanzapine treatment decreases weight gain in rats; a pharmacodynamic event-related effect that differs considerably from what is observed in the clinical condition. The possibility of mismatched models regarding body weight changes during drug augmentation therapy should be seriously considered.", 
    "161": "As the ideal sedative does not exist for all situations, we examined the effect of a midazolam-ketamine sedoanalgesic admixture in human volunteers. Ten ASA physical status I volunteers were administered loading doses of 0.07 mg/kg of midazolam followed by 0.7 mg/kg of ketamine. The same amount of midazolam and ketamine was then infused constantly over 1 hour via a 60 drops (gtts)/mL i.v. infusion set. Blood samples were analyzed for plasma catecholamine levels. Respiration rate and oxygen saturation did not alter significantly from baseline levels. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure remained stable with an increase of 15% in heart rate and 6% in systolic blood pressure only at 10 minutes following the bolus loading. Diastolic blood pressure did not alter significantly from baseline levels (P < .05). Plasma catecholamines levels remained stable except for an increase in epinephrine (38%) and norepinephrine (19%) 10 minutes following the bolus injections. Plasma dopamine levels remained unchanged. There were no cases of unpleasant dreaming, dysphoria, or emergence-type reactions. This combined nonnarcotic sedoanalgesic technique maintains spontaneous ventilation and stable cardiorespiratory parameters and may be considered as an alternative to traditional conscious sedation or general anesthesia.",

    "163": "A prospective observational study in two phases. In phase one, midazolam 2-4 mg was used as induction agent and in phase two, etomidate 0.2-0.3 mg/kg was used. The haemodynamic data were recorded before and after intubation for comparison. Changes in mean systolic blood pressure were analysed with SPSS software.", 
    "164": "A 10% decrease in mean systolic blood pressure was observed in the midazolam group (p = 0.001) while there was no significant change in the etomidate group. Some 19.5% of patients had hypotension after being given midazolam while only 3.6% with etomidate (p = 0.002). Patients older than 70 tended to have more hypotension episodes but the difference was not statistically significant.", 
    "165": "Midazolam, even in low dose, was more likely than etomidate to cause significant hypotension when used as an induction agent for rapid sequence intubation. Etomidate is a better alternative.", 
    "166": "Using a dialysis probe near CA1 hippocampal recording electrodes, we infused nonspecific (scopolamine) and specific (methoctramine, pirenzepine) antagonists of muscarinic cholinergic transmission to determine their effects on the positional firing properties of place cells. Both low (0.5 mM) and high (2.0 or 3.0 mM) scopolamine significantly decreased in-field firing rate, increased the ratio of out-of-field to in-field rate, and reduced the smoothness of rate maps, while tending to increase out-of-field rate. Thus, local nonspecific muscarinic blockade mimicked the effects seen with intracerebroventricular application, suggesting that blockade of receptors local to the recorded cells plays an essential role. Unexpectedly, dialysis of scopolamine reduced locomotor activity, again duplicating the effects of intracerebroventricular administration. Most effects of methoctramine (1.0 mM), which blocks presynaptic m2 and m4 receptors, were initially strong but then diminished over hours. Methoctramine produced a significant increase only in out/in ratio and out-of-field rate, whereas it tended to increase in-field rate and monotonically decrease smoothness. Pirenzepine (3.0 mM), which blocks postsynaptic m1 receptors, produced a significant increase only in out/in ratio, whereas it tended to increase out-of-field rate and decrease in-field rate; all these effects were monotonic with respect to time. A mixture of methoctramine plus pirenzepine recapitulated the place-cell effects of scopolamine, although neither the mixture nor its separate components affected behavior. We conclude that the effects of scopolamine on place cells likely result from a combination of blockade of postsynaptic m1 receptors, leading to reduced excitability, with blockade of presynaptic m2 and m4 receptors, leading to increased out-of-field firing.", 
    "167": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is the major physiologic regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and plays a key role in coordinating the mammalian stress response. Substantial data implicates hyperactivity of CRF neuronal systems in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders. Enhanced CRF expression, release, and function have also been demonstrated during acute withdrawal from several drugs of abuse. Previous studies revealed that chronic administration of the anxiolytic alprazolam reduced indices of CRF and CRF1 receptor function. Conversely, measures of urocortin I and CRF2 receptor function were increased. To further scrutinize these findings, we sought to determine whether CRF neuronal systems are activated during spontaneous withdrawal from the triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam in dependent rats and to characterize the time course, extent, and regional specificity of the patterns of activation. After 14 d of alprazolam administration (90 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), spontaneous withdrawal produced activation of the HPA axis, as well as suppression of food intake and weight loss that peaked 24-48 hr after withdrawal. Remarkably, CRF mRNA expression in the cerebral cortex was markedly (>300%) increased over the same time period. Other indices of CRF-CRF1 and urocortin I-CRF2A function, altered by chronic alprazolam treatment as previously described, returned to pretreatment levels over 96 hr. The physiologic significance of this dramatic induction of cortical CRF mRNA expression, as well as whether this occurs during withdrawal from other drugs of abuse is yet to be determined. The marked increase in CRFergic neurotransmission is hypothesized to play a major role in benzodiazepine withdrawal.", 
    "168": "The aim of this work was to determine whether diazepam could induce the multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) phenotype in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli strains. The Mar phenotype is characterized by decreased susceptibility to multiple antibiotics due to the loss of porins and/or increased expression of active efflux systems. The effect of subinhibitory concentrations of diazepam on the susceptibility of different antimicrobial agents, outer-membrane protein expression and norfloxacin intracellular accumulation was studied. The results revealed that diazepam concentrations equal or twice adult dosage induced the same Mar phenotype as two well known E. coli marRAB inducers, sodium salicylate and sodium benzoate. Susceptibility to norfloxacin in a K. pneumoniae clinical isolate and E. coli strain Ag100 decreased due to enhanced active efflux and loss of porin expression. A decreased susceptibility to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, nalidixic acid and beta-lactam antibiotics was also observed. In conclusion, like sodium salicylate or sodium benzoate, diazepam may induce the Mar phenotype.", 
    "169": "Deep sedation is being provided at an increasing rate for patients undergoing bone marrow biopsy and aspiration (BMBA). The aim of this study was to establish the safety of deep sedation used for adults undergoing BMBA. A nonrandomized database analysis and retrospective review of patient records from January 1997 to December 2000 was performed; 5,811 patients were identified as having undergone their first outpatient BMBA. Outcome measures included 30-day mortality and same-day hospital admission; surrogate measures included need for a surgical procedure or receipt of red blood cells within the 48 hr following the BMBA. Patients who received intravenously administered midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol for maintenance of deep sedation plus infiltration of a local anesthetic (n = 2,604; 45%) comprised the deep sedation group; those who received infiltration of a local anesthetic but no intravenous sedation or analgesia (n = 3,207; 55%) comprised the local anesthesia group. Patients in the deep sedation group compared to those in the local anesthesia group were less likely to die within 30 days (0.69% vs. 1.34%, P = 0.018) and less likely to receive red blood cells (1.27% vs. 2.25%, P = 0.006). No other differences between the groups were found. Although the study was retrospective and nonrandomized, the results suggest that the use of deep sedation for outpatient BMBA is as safe as using local anesthesia."
