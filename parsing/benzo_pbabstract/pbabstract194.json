    "1": "Dutch Belted Pigmented rabbits weighing 2-2.5 kg were used in these studies. Excised posterior segment tissues (RPE-choroid-sclera and sclera), mounted on the Ussing chamber, were used as an ex vivo model. Transport studies were carried out across sclera and RPE-choroid-sclera (RCS) tissue preparations in the sclera to retina (S --> R) and retina to sclera (R --> S) directions for 3 hr at 37 degrees C. The model was validated by permeability studies with paracellular and transcellular markers ([(3)H]mannitol and [(14)C]diazepam, respectively), tissue viability studies (bioelectrical and biochemical assays), and tissue histology and electron microscopy studies. Functional presence of a carrier-mediated transport system for folic acid (folate receptor alpha) was investigated on the basolateral side of the rabbit retina.", 
    "2": "Results from bioelectrical, biochemical, and histological evaluation of tissue provide evidence that the RCS tissue preparation remains viable during the period of transport study. Permeability values of [(3)H]mannitol across sclera were 4.18 +/- 1.09 x 10(- 5) cm/s (R --> S) and 4.11 +/- 1.09 x 10(- 5) cm/s (S --> R) and across RCS were 1.77 +/- 0.31 x 10(- 5) cm/s (S --> R) and 1.60 +/- 0.19 x 10(- 5) cm/s (R --> S). Permeability values of [(14)C]diazepam across sclera were 2.37 +/- 0.38 x 10(- 5) cm/s (R --> S) and 2.70 +/- 0.70 x 10(- 5) cm/s (S --> R) and across RCS were 3.12 +/- 0.12 x 10(- 5) cm/s (R --> S) and 2.77 +/- 0.25 x 10(- 5)cm/s (S --> R). The rate of [(3)H]folic acid transport across RCS was found to be significantly higher in the S -->R direction (16.34 +/- 0.94 fmoles min(-1) cm(-2)) as compared with R --> S direction (9.38 +/- 1.44 fmoles min(-1) cm(-2)) and nearly 10-fold higher across sclera as compared with RCS in both directions. Transport of [(3)H]folic acid was found to be pH and temperature dependent and was inhibited by 44.5%, 35.1%, and 50.3% in the presence of unlabeled folic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTF), and Methotrexate (MTX).", 
    "3": "The RCS tissue preparation mounted on the Ussing chamber system, an ex vivo model, can be a useful tool for identification and characterization of carrier-mediated systems present on RPE (a major barrier for retinal drug delivery) and to study carrier-mediated retinal drug delivery via prodrug derivatization.", 
    "4": "The primary objective of this study is to compare the intubation success rates of etomidate and midazolam when used for sedative-facilitated intubation, without paralytics, in out-of-hospital adult patients.", 
    "5": "This prospective, double-blind, randomized trial was conducted with 2 ground out-of-hospital advanced life support systems (ALS); all patients aged 18 or older who required out-of-hospital sedative-facilitated intubation were eligible for participation. The ambulances were stocked with blinded numbered syringes containing either 7 mg of midazolam or 20 mg of etomidate. No paralytics were used. If sedation was not achieved with the study drug, medics could request additional sedation from a medical command physician; only midazolam or diazepam were available outside of the study.", 
    "6": "One hundred ten patients were enrolled in the study; 55 patients received midazolam and 55 patients received etomidate. The 2 groups were similar with regard to age, sex, initial vital signs, and reasons for intubation or sedation. The overall intubation success rate was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 68% to 84%); 75% (41/55) for midazolam (95% CI 64% to 86%) and 76% (42/55) for etomidate (95% CI 65% to 87%). There was also no difference in incidence of hypotension, number of intubation attempts, or perceived difficulty of intubation. Additional sedation was requested almost equally for the 2 groups: 14 patients in the midazolam group and 12 patients in the etomidate group. A benzodiazepine was successful for rescue of a failed etomidate intubation 10 of 12 times (83%; 95% CI 62% to 100%). When used for rescue of failed midazolam intubations, benzodiazepines were effective in only 5 of 14 (36%, 95% CI 11% to 61%) attempts.", 
    "7": "There were no observed differences between midazolam and etomidate in sedation-facilitated intubation success rates; we could not fully evaluate global outcomes of these agents or the sedative-facilitated intubation strategy itself.", 
    "8": "The aim of sedation and analgesia is to prevent secondary brain insult. The goals of sedation are the prevention and treatment of intracranial hypertension and systemic disorders. In such situation, the use of sedative and analgesic therapy should respect the rate of cerebral blood flow/cerebral oxygen consumption coupling while preserving cerebral perfusion pressure and decreasing the intracranial pressure. This treatment should have an analgesic and myorelaxing action with short and predictable time of action. The optimal agent with all these characteristics does not exist, but the combination of several pharmacological compounds may reach this goal. Benzodiazepines are the most frequently agents used. In most of cases they are associated with analgesics like opioids or ketamine. Opioids are the basis of analgesia because they do not produce brain haemodynamic alterations if arterial pressure is maintained. Ketamine, which use in this indication is matter of debate, has the advantage to maintain haemodynamics. Ketamine has no side effects on brain haemodynamics when used in combination with propofol or midazolam. Because of their side effects on haemodynamics and immune response, barbituric are no longer used as long term sedative agents. However, they are still recommended in cases of refractory intracranial hypertension. Propofol remains the optimal sedative agent because of its short duration action although its use is restricted because it is an expensive drug. Its use is recommended for short time sedation with or without opioids. The use of neuromuscular blockers should be focused on the patients with an intracranial hypertension refractory to standard treatment. The presence of brain damage in patients makes difficult to assess the level of sedation. One should avoid over sedation, which increases morbidity by prolongation of the duration of mechanical ventilation.", 
    "9": "Given that suicidality is a well-known symptom and outcome of untreated or inadequately treated depressive illness, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning of emergent suicidality in children and adolescents based on the antidepressant arm of placebo-controlled randomized trials (RCTs) has created understandable concern in clinical practice. The issues involved are of broader public health importance for all age groups. As in other branches of medicine, psychiatrists must always be vigilant of the rare risk of iatrogenesis when prescribing potent agents like antidepressants for patients with depressive disorders where the risk of suicidality is inherent. The overall evidence we review suggests that the widespread use of antidepressants in the new \"SSRI-era\" appear to have actually led to highly significant decline in suicide rates in most countries with traditionally high baseline suicide rates. The decline is particularly striking for women who, compared with men, seek more help for depression. Recent clinical data on large samples in the US too have revealed a protective effect of antidepressant against suicide. We argue that the discrepancy between RCTs (in children) and national and clinical suicide statistics (in adults) may reside in new provocative data documenting high rates of unrecognized pseudo-unipolar mixed states particularly in juvenile, but also in adult, clinical populations. Such an interpretation accords well with equally provocative data that bipolar II (which is often \"mixed\" in nature) may well represent a particularly vulnerable clinical substrate for suicidality. In this respect, the widespread (at least in the psychiatric sector) augmentation of antidepressants with benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics or mood stabilizers may represent one situation where current practice is superior to evidence-based medicine. We conclude that rather than being a threat, the judicious clinical use of antidepressants actually does serve to effectively treat and indeed protect depressed patients from suicidal outcome. The fact of being in treatment with regular clinical follow-up appears beneficial as well.", 
    "10": "Tofisopam is an anxiolytic agent of the BZD group, chemically 1(3-4 dimethoxyphenyl)-4methyl-5-ethyl-7,8 dimethoxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine. TZP differs from the traditional 1,4-benzodiazepines regarding the positions of the nitrogen atoms. Three clinical cases were reported where tofisopam increased the blood level of immunosuppressive agent leading clinically relevant adverse drug reaction and necessitating reduction of the dose of the drugs or discontinuation of the administration of tofisopam. The administered immunosuppressive agent is a substrate of the CYP3A4 system, so the effect of tofisopam on the CYP3A4 enzyme was investigated in vitro using human recombinant CYP3A4 supersome. Benzyoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin (BFC) was used as substrate. Tofisopam in 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 5 micromol/l concentrations inhibited dose dependently the enzyme activity. Activity inhibition rates were 4%, 29%, 40%, 56%, 61% and 94%, respectively and the IC50 was 0.8 micromol/l. The IC50 of positive control substance ketoconazole was 0.03 micromol/l. In in vitro experiments the inhibitory effect of tofisopam was lower than that of ketoconazole (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) with an order of magnitude. According to the in vitro results it could be concluded that tofisopam is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 but to clarify the clinical importance of this inhibition further human clinical data are needed.", 
    "11": "Based on preliminary evidence of its usefulness in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), an olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) was examined in comparison with olanzapine, fluoxetine, and venlafaxine in a TRD population. In this 12-week double-blind study, 483 subjects with unipolar, nonpsychotic TRD, with historic failure on a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and prospective failure on open-label venlafaxine, were randomized to an OFC or to an olanzapine, fluoxetine, or venlafaxine monotherapy group. Venlafaxine was continued randomly in the double-blind acute phase to explore the benefits of continuation versus switching therapy. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total change score at end point was the primary outcome measure. The OFC group had significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms by week 1 of treatment (MADRS mean change =-7.2, baseline =29.6), in comparison to olanzapine (-4.8, P=.03), fluoxetine (-4.7, P=.03), or venlafaxine (-3.7, P=.002) groups and maintained its statistical separation from all three monotherapy groups through week 6. At end point, the OFC group was significantly different only from the olanzapine group (-14.1 vs. -7.7, P<.001). Analysis of a subgroup of subjects who had an SSRI failure in their current depressive episode (n=334) revealed statistical separation from both olanzapine and fluoxetine (but not venlafaxine) at end point: OFC (-14.6) versus olanzapine (-9.4, P<.001) versus fluoxetine (-10.7, P=.006) versus venlafaxine (-14.7, P=.98). The OFC had a safety profile comparable to its component monotherapies (i.e., olanzapine and fluoxetine), showed a rapid onset of antidepressant effect, and was effective in this TRD sample. At the study end point, OFC, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, and low-dose OFC all appeared to be similarly effective.", 
    "12": "The atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine increases body weight and visceral adiposity in schizophrenia. In rats, aging-associated increased body weight and visceral adiposity are reversed by administration of the pineal hormone melatonin. We asked if melatonin similarly would reverse olanzapine-induced increased weight and visceral adiposity in rats. Four groups (n=11/group) of female rats (240-250 g) were treated for 8 weeks with olanzapine, melatonin, olanzapine+melatonin, or vehicle alone in drinking water. Body weight and food and water consumption were determined weekly, locomotor activity at weeks 3 and 6, and nocturnal plasma melatonin concentration at week 7. At week 8, the rats were killed and visceral (perirenal, retroperitoneal, omental, and mesenteric) fat pads dissected and weighed. Olanzapine treatment reduced nocturnal plasma melatonin by 55% (p<0.001), which was restored to control levels by olanzapine+melatonin. Body weight increased 18% in rats treated with olanzapine alone, but only 10% with olanzapine+melatonin, 5% with melatonin alone, and 7% with vehicle control. Body weight and visceral fat pad weight increases in rats treated with olanzapine alone were greater than in each of the other three groups (all p<0.01), which were not significantly different. These results suggest that olanzapine-induced increases in body weight and visceral adiposity may be at least in part secondary to olanzapine-induced reduction of plasma melatonin levels, and that melatonin may be useful for the management of olanzapine-induced weight gain in humans.", 
    "13": "The present study investigated the role of the alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptors in the neurobehavioral actions of alcohol. In Experiment 1, mice lacking the alpha1 subunit (alpha1 (-/-)) were tested for their capacity to initiate operant-lever press responding for alcohol or sucrose. Alcohol intake in the home cage was also measured. In Experiment 2, the alpha1 (-/-) mice were injected with a range of alcohol doses (0.875-4.0 g/kg; i.p.) to evaluate the significance of the alpha1 subunit in alcohol's stimulant actions. In Experiment 3, we determined if the alcohol-induced stimulant effects were regulated via dopaminergic (DA) or benzodiazepine (BDZ)-dependent mechanisms. To accomplish this, we investigated the capacity of DA (eticlopride, SCH 23390) and BDZ (flumazenil, betaCCt) receptor antagonists to attenuate the alcohol-induced stimulant actions. Compared with wild-type mice (alpha1 (+/+)), the null mutants showed marked reductions in both EtOH and sucrose-maintained responding, and home-cage alcohol drinking. The null mutants also showed significant increases in locomotor behaviors after injections of low-moderate alcohol doses (1.75-3.0 g/kg). betaCCt, flumazenil, eticlopride, and SCH 23390 were able to attenuate the alcohol-induced stimulation in mutant mice, in the absence of intrinsic effects. These data suggest the alpha1 receptor plays an important role in alcohol-motivated behaviors; however, it also appears crucial in regulating the reinforcing properties associated with normal ingestive behaviors. Deleting the alpha1 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor appears to unmask alcohol's stimulatory effects; these effects appear to be regulated via an interaction of both DA- and GABA(A) BDZ-dependent mechanisms.", 
    "14": "In vitro preparations of whole urinary bladders of neonatal rats exhibit prominent myogenic spontaneous contractions, the amplitude and frequency of which can be increased by muscarinic agonists. The muscarinic receptor subtype responsible for this facilitation was examined in the present experiments. Basal spontaneous contractions in bladders from 1- to 2-wk-old Sprague-Dawley rats were not affected by M2 or M3 receptor antagonists. However, administration of 0.5 microM physostigmine, an anticholinesterase agent that increases the levels of endogenous acetylcholine, or 50-100 nM carbachol, a cholinergic agonist at low concentrations, which did not cause tonic contractions, significantly augmented the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous contractions. Blockade of M2 receptors with 0.1 microM AF-DX 116 or 1 microM methoctramine or blockade of M3 receptors with 50 nM 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide or 0.1 microM 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-(2-chloroethyl)piperidine hydrochloride (4-DAMP mustard) reversed the physostigmine and carbachol responses. M2 and M3 receptor blockade did not alter the facilitation of spontaneous contractions induced by 10 nM BAY K 8644, an L-type Ca2+ channel opener, or 0.1 microM iberiotoxin, a large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker. NS-1619 (30 microM), a large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel opener, decreased carbachol-augmented spontaneous contractions. These results suggest that spontaneous contractions in the neonatal rat bladder are enhanced by activation of M2 and M3 receptors by endogenous acetylcholine released in the presence of an anticholinesterase agent or a cholinergic receptor agonist.",

Chromatographic separation was performed with a Waters XTerra MS C18 [150 x 2.1 mm (i.d.); bead size, 5 microm] reversed-phase column with deuterated analogs of the analytes as internal standards (IS). Detection was performed with a triple-quadruple mass spectrometer that monitored 2 specific transitions per compound in the electrospray, positive-ion selected-reaction monitoring mode. We tested this technique on urine samples from 12 healthy volunteers and 1 forensic sample obtained in a case of alleged drug-facilitated sexual assault.",

We used sexual dysfunction was assessed by a semistructured interview based on the items of the UKU side effect rating scale. Three olanzapine-treated patients (12.0%), compared with 11 risperidone-treated patients (52.4%), reported sexual dysfunctions (p = .008) in the semistructured interview. Only 4 patients (8.7%) spontaneously reported sexual dysfunction. The mean dose was 9.4 mg/d for olanzapine and 3.4 mg/d for risperidone. The mean (+/-SD) prolactin levels (ng/mL) in olanzapine-and risperidone-treated patients were 25.1 (+/- 23.5) and 43.5 (+/- 26.1), respectively. Less sexual dysfunction occurred in the group treated with olanzapine compared with the risperidone group. Direct questioning about sexual functioning is necessary to avoid underestimating the frequency of sexual side effects in patients with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.",

    "25": "Chemogenomics is a new strategy in drug discovery which, in principle, searches for all molecules that are capable of interacting with any biological target. Because of the almost infinite number of drug-like organic molecules, this is an impossible task. Therefore chemogenomics has been defined as the investigation of classes of compounds (libraries) against families of functionally related proteins. In this definition, chemogenomics deals with the systematic analysis of chemical-biological interactions. Congeneric series of chemical analogs are probes to investigate their action on specific target classes, e.g., GPCRs, kinases, phosphodiesterases, ion channels, serine proteases, and others. Whereas such a strategy developed in pharmaceutical industry almost 20 years ago, it is now more systematically applied in the search for target- and subtype-specific ligands. The term \"privileged structures\" has been defined for scaffolds, such as the benzodiazepines, which very often produce biologically active analogs in a target family, in this case in the class of G-protein-coupled receptors. The SOSA approach is a strategy to modify the selectivity of biologically active compounds, generating new drug candidates from the side activities of therapeutically used drugs.", 
    "26": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency. It requires prompt and adequate diagnosis and treatment, as it may induce CNS injury. It is mainly distinguished into generalised and partial SE on the basis of its major clinical features. There are very few data about SE physiopathology, but it is generally characterised by increasing unresponsiveness to treatment. SE diagnosis is based on EEG recording, associated with neuroimaging techniques and laboratory assays to detect underlying pathologies. During SE we distinguish three different conditions: initial, defined and refractory. Benzodiazepines represent first-line treatment, followed by phenytoin. Refractory SE requires ICU treatment to perform general anaesthesia.", 
    "27": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of safranal, an active constituent of Crocus sativus L. stigmas, on seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) microinjection of safranal (4.84, 9.68 and 24.2 micromol) had no effects on tonic and clonic phases as well as mortality upon seizures induced by PTZ (90mg/kg body wt., i.p.). Peripheral administration of safranal (72.75, 145.5 and 291 mg/kg body wt., i.p.), however, induced a dose-dependent decrease in the incidence of both minimal clonic seizures (MCS) (145.5 mg/kg body wt., p<0.01) and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) (145.5 mg/kg body wt., p<0.001) following PTZ administration. Safranal also increased MCS and GTCS latency, significantly. Percent of protection against GTCS was 30%, 100% and 100% and mortality protection percent was 40%, 100% and 100% for the mentioned doses, respectively. Pretreatment with flumazenil (5 nmol, i.c.v.) and naloxone (5.5 nmol, i.c.v. and 2 mg/kg body wt., i.p.), 15 min prior to safranal administration (145.5 mg/kg body wt., i.p.), abolished the protective effect of safranal on MCS. Flumazenil also decreased the effect of safranal on incidence as well as latency of GTCS, significantly. These effects were not, however, significant for naloxone (5.5 nmol, i.c.v. and 2mg/kg body wt., i.p.). Results of this study demonstrated that safranal could exert anticonvulsant activity in the PTZ model and this effect may be mediated, at least partly, through GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex.",

Hair and nail samples were obtained from patients who had recently discontinued or were currently prescribed one or more of the targeted drugs. Prazepam was used as the internal standard for all compounds. Some components in the hair matrix gave the same transitions as some of the analytes but did not compromise the analyses because their retention times differed from those for the target compounds. The analytical run time was 8-10min. Results of the hair analysis of a DFSA victim are also presented.", 
    "29": "The changes in spatial memory performances and the binding of hippocampal peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) induced by D-galactose (D-gal) were investigated in rats. The animals were randomly divided into two groups: saline-treated group and D-gal-induced aging group. All rats received 56 days of injection followed by 5 days of behavioral tests. The D-gal-induced aging rats presented significant impairment in water maze performance, compared with that in the saline-treated rats. A significant decrease in [3H]PK11195 binding in the synaptosomes from hippocampus in the D-gal-induced aging rats was observed, compared to that in the saline-treated rats. Meanwhile, the Scatchard analysis revealed that there was a decrease in Bmax, with no significant change in KD. Further analysis demonstrated that water maze performance was closely related to the PK11195 binding in all rats. These results suggest that D-gal decreased the density of PBR in hippocampal synaptosomes, which may be attributable to the progressive pathogenesis of aging in rats.", 
    "30": "Adjunctive treatment with the selective alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan augments the effect of conventional antipsychotics in treatment-resistant schizophrenics comparing favourably with clozapine. Clozapine has high affinity for alpha2 adrenoceptors. Previously, we found that adjunctive idazoxan treatment to the dopamine (DA) D2/3 antagonist raclopride enhanced raclopride-induced effects in an animal model of antipsychotic activity (conditioned avoidance response, CAR) and, similarly to clozapine, reversed the disruption of working memory induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade in rats with a concomitant increase in prefrontal DA efflux. To further investigate the significance of alpha2 adrenoceptor affinity for antipsychotic efficacy, we here investigated, in rats, the effects of adjunctive idazoxan treatment to low doses of a typical (haloperidol) and an atypical (olanzapine) antipsychotic drug, both lacking appreciable alpha2 adrenoceptor affinity, on (i) CAR; (ii) catalepsy; and (iii) DA output in the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens using microdialysis. Adjunctive treatment with idazoxan to haloperidol or olanzapine enhanced suppression of CAR to a level predicting sufficient antipsychotic activity, increased DA output preferentially in the prefrontal cortex, and reversed haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Our data confirm and extend our previous findings as well as clinical observations, and suggest that adjunctive alpha2 adrenoceptor blockade both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs, lacking appreciable affinity for the alpha2 adrenoceptor, may contribute to a more advantageous therapeutical profile of these drugs in schizophrenia treatment, allowing for reduced DA D2 occupancy and reduction of unwanted side-effects.", 
    "31": "von Willebrand factor (VWF) plays a critical role in the process of hemostasis by mediating flow-dependent adhesion and spreading of platelets on exposed extracellular matrix proteins following vascular injury.

    "33": "In the presence of botrocetin and inhibitors of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2), VWF is able to support formation of lamellipodia through a GPIb-dependent mechanism that is independent of alpha(IIb)beta3 and PI3-kinase. Lamellipodia formation under these conditions is incomplete. In marked contrast, in the presence of ristocetin, VWF stimulates formation of fully spread lamellipodia through a pathway that is dependent upon alpha(IIb)beta3 and PI3-kinase. Furthermore, alpha(IIb)beta3 also supports platelet spreading on VWF alone, but only in the absence of inhibitors of ADP and TxA2. The localization of filamentous actin and the Arp2/3 complex in platelets on VWF in the presence of botrocetin and ristocetin are distinct, yielding disparate lamellipodium kinetic signatures. Interestingly, botrocetin significantly enhances platelet adhesion to VWF under flow in whole blood in an alpha(IIb)beta3-independent manner, while ristocetin augments washed platelet adhesion and spreading to VWF under flow in an alpha(IIb)beta3-dependent manner.",

    "35": "Mice with point-mutated alpha2 GABAA receptor subunits (rendering them diazepam insensitive) are resistant to the anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepines (BZs) in unconditioned models of anxiety. We investigated the role of the alpha2 GABAA subtype in a model of conditioned anxiety. alpha2(H101R) and wildtype mice were trained in a conditioned emotional response (CER) task, in which lever-pressing for food on a variable interval (VI) schedule was suppressed during the presentation of a conditioned stimulus (CS+) that predicted footshock. The ability of diazepam, ethanol and pentobarbital to reduce suppression during the CS+ was interpreted as an anxiolytic response. Diazepam (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effect in wildtype mice. At high doses, diazepam (2, 4 and 8 mg/kg) was sedative in alpha2(H101R) mice. Analysis of the anxiolytic properties of nonsedative diazepam doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg), showed that alpha2(H101R) mice were resistant to the anxiolytic effects of diazepam. Equivalent anxiolytic properties of pentobarbital (20 mg/kg) and ethanol (1 and 2 g/kg) were seen in both genotypes. These findings confirm the critical importance of the alpha2 GABAA subtype in mediating BZ anxiolysis. However, as a compound, L-838417, with agonist properties at alpha2, alpha3 and alpha5-containing receptors, gave rise to anxiolytic-like activity in alpha2(H101R) mice in the CER test, alpha3-containing GABA receptors are also likely to contribute to anxiolysis. Observations that alpha2(H101R) mice were more active, and displayed a greater suppression of lever pressing in response to fear-conditioned stimuli than wildtype mice, suggests that the alpha2(H101R) mutation may not be behaviourally silent.", 
    "36": "In benzodiazepine (BZ)-dependent animals, the effects of negative GABA(A) modulators at BZ sites are not clearly related to differences in negative efficacy (i.e., inverse agonist activity). A flumazenil discriminative stimulus in diazepam (5.6 mg/kg/day)-treated rhesus monkeys was used to test the hypothesis that the effects of negative GABA(A) modulators at BZ sites do not vary as a function of efficacy in BZ-dependent animals. Negative GABA(A) modulators varying in efficacy were studied in combination with positive modulators acting at different modulatory sites (BZ, barbiturate, and neuroactive steroid sites). The negative modulators Ro 15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-alpha]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) substituted for the flumazenil discriminative stimulus. Acute pretreatment with diazepam (3.2 and 10 mg/kg s.c., in addition to 5.6 mg/kg/day p.o.), pentobarbital (3.2 and 10 mg/kg), or pregnanolone (1 and 3.2 mg/kg) attenuated the flumazenil discriminative stimulus and also attenuated the flumazenil-like discriminative stimulus effects of Ro 15-4513 and beta-CCE. Attenuation of the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil, Ro 15-4513, and beta-CCE did not systematically vary as a function of negative efficacy. Compared with their discriminative stimulus effects in untreated monkeys discriminating midazolam, both pregnanolone and pentobarbital were relatively more potent than diazepam in attenuating the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil, Ro 15-4513, and beta-CCE in diazepam-treated monkeys. These results show that the discriminative stimulus effects of BZ-site neutral and negative modulators are not different in BZ-dependent animals trained to discriminate flumazenil, and extend the results of a previous study showing that positive modulators acting at non-BZ sites are especially potent in attenuating the effects of flumazenil in diazepam-treated monkeys (i.e., diazepam withdrawal).",

    "47": "To determine predictors of substantial weight gain (SWG) during treatment of bipolar disorder with olanzapine, data were pooled from 4 long-term randomized, multicenter studies in patients with bipolar mania or mixed mania (N = 948 at initiation of olanzapine). SWG was defined as gaining 5 kg or 7% of initial weight in 30 +/- 2 weeks. Logistic regression estimated odds ratios associated with early weight gain and baseline risk factors for predicting SWG. A classification system to identify patients at risk for SWG was constructed by recursive data partitioning. Baseline characteristics significantly associated with SWG included younger age, nonwhite ethnicity, lower body mass index (BMI), nonrapid cycling, and psychotic features. Weight gain of 2 or more kg in the first 3 weeks of therapy predicted SWG by 30 weeks (sensitivity = 57%; specificity = 71%). A classification system with thresholds for early weight gain, baseline BMI, and ethnicity further improved SWG predictability (sensitivity = 79%; specificity = 70%). In conclusion, patients with bipolar disorder who gained 2 to 3 kg during the first 3 weeks of treatment with olanzapine, SWG was predicted after 30 weeks of treatment. Patients with less pronounced early weight gain might still be at risk for later SWG if they have close to normal BMI (< or =27 kg/m) at treatment initiation.", 
    "48": "Short-acting hypnotic drugs, such as zolpidem, have minimal residual effects but may not provide optimal efficacy throughout the night for all insomnia patients. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem-MR, has been developed to overcome this limitation. This was a phase I, double-blind, 3-way crossover, placebo-controlled study to investigate the residual psychomotor and cognitive effects of a single oral dose of zolpidem-MR 12.5 mg in 18 healthy young adults. Flurazepam 30 mg was used as a positive control. No comparison with standard immediate-release zolpidem was made. Five neuropsychological tests and 2 subjective tests were performed 8 hours after dosing. The safety of zolpidem-MR was also investigated. Performance on the Critical Flicker Fusion Frequency test, Choice Reaction Time, Immediate and Delayed Word Recall, and the Compensatory Tracking Task was significantly impaired by flurazepam but not by zolpidem-MR (with the exception of the Compensatory Tracking Task) or placebo. No significant effects were observed on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. The Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire showed that both drugs improved the ease of getting to sleep and perceived quality of sleep, whereas only flurazepam significantly impaired the ease of awakening. Neither drug scored significantly better than placebo on the Bond and Lader contentedness scale, but both induced a significant difference in calmness; only flurazepam significantly reduced alertness. The safety profile of zolpidem-MR was comparable to placebo. In conclusion, the study showed the good tolerance of zolpidem-MR in terms of residual neuropsychological effects as well as a beneficial effect on sleep quality in young healthy adults.", 
    "49": "Benzodiazepine use by patients in methadone and buprenorphine substitution treatment is common, despite safety concerns regarding these drug interactions. The relative safety of diazepam use by methadone- or buprenorphine-treated patients has not been systematically examined. This study aimed to examine the effect of single diazepam doses, within normal therapeutic range (doses: 0, 10, and 20 mg), upon physiological, subjective, and performance measures in stable methadone and buprenorphine-treated patients. In a double-blind, randomized crossover design, methadone- or buprenorphine-treated patients were administered their normal opioid dose and either placebo, 10-, or 20-mg diazepam, in balanced order over 3 sessions. Eight methadone- and 8 buprenorphine-prescribed patients with no concurrent benzodiazepine dependence or significant comorbidity were recruited from an outpatient addiction clinic in London. Measures were taken at baseline and for 6 hours after dosing, and included physiological responses (pulse rate, blood pressure, pupil size, respiratory rate, and peripheral pO2), subjective drug effects (Addiction Research Center Inventory subscales, visual analog scales of strength of drug effect, drug-liking, and sedation), and performance measures (simple reaction time, cancellation task, digit symbol substitution task, and balance). The 10- and 20-mg diazepam doses resulted in comparable subjective experiences of greater sedation and strength of drug effects in both patient groups, and had minimal impact on physiological parameters. However, diazepam had greater peak effects on performance measures (simple reaction time, digit symbol substitution task, and cancellation time) in methadone-treated than in buprenorphine-treated patients. Diazepam may significantly alter the response to opioid substitution treatment with methadone or buprenorphine.", 
    "50": "This study assessed the abuse potential of pagoclone, a partial agonist at the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) benzodiazepine receptor site, in healthy recreational drug users. Twenty-three young adults, who reported past recreational use of sedative drugs or alcohol, participated in 4 sessions during which capsules containing pagoclone (doses: 1.2 mg, the higher end of the proposed therapeutic dose range, and 4.8 mg, a 4-fold higher dose), diazepam (dose, 30 mg), or placebo were randomly administered under double-blind conditions. Subjective ratings of mood, drug effects, and psychomotor tests were completed at regular intervals after ingesting the capsules. On most of the standardized measures of abuse potential, pagoclone (dose, 4.8 mg) was rated as being similar to diazepam. Both drugs increased the ratings of good effects and drug liking. However, pagoclone also produced some adverse mood effects that might limit its potential to be used recreationally, and it produced fewer sedativelike effects on some measures. In general, the results with these doses indicate that the abuse potential of pagoclone is similar to that of diazepam, although its profile as a partial agonist suggests that differences between the drugs may emerge at higher doses.",

Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with an initial dose of olanzapine 10 mg/d or more (n = 120) or risperidone 3 mg/d or more (n = 115). The primary efficacy measure was the SANS summary score.

    "55": "Treatment of schizophrenia with olanzapine and other atypical antipsychotic agents is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. The mechanism for this is not understood. Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing cytokine secreted by adipocytes. It is present in serum in multimers of varying size. Trimers and hexamers are referred to as low molecular weight (LMW) adiponectin. Larger multimers (12-, 18-, and 24-mers) have been designated high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin and seem responsible for the insulin-sensitizing action of this adipokine. The aim of this study was to examine total adiponectin and LMW and HMW multimers in serum from patients with schizophrenia treated with either olanzapine (n = 9) or other typical antipsychotics (n = 9) and compare results with 16 healthy sex-, body mass index-, and age-matched controls. The effects of olanzapine on adiponectin protein expression and secretion in in vitro-differentiated primary human adipocytes were also examined. Patients receiving olanzapine had significantly lower total serum adiponectin as compared with those on conventional treatment and controls (5.23 +/- 1.53 ng/mL vs. 8.20 +/- 3.77 ng/mL and 8.78 +/- 3.8 ng/mL; P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). The HMW adiponectin was also reduced in patients on olanzapine as compared with the disease and healthy control groups (1.67 +/- 0.96 ng/mL vs. 3.87 +/- 2.69 ng/mL and 4.07 +/- 3.2 ng/mL; P < 0.05 for both). The LMW adiponectin was not different between patient groups (P = 0.15) but lower in patients on olanzapine as compared with controls (3.56 +/- 0.85 ng/mL vs. 4.70 +/- 1.4 ng/mL; P < 0.05). In vitro, short duration (up to 7 days) olanzapine exposure had no effect on total adiponectin expression or multimer composition of secreted protein. In summary, this study demonstrates a correlation between olanzapine treatment and reduced serum adiponectin, particularly HMW multimers. This may not be a direct effect of olanzapine on adipocyte expression or secretion of adiponectin. These observations provide insights into possible mechanisms for the association between olanzapine treatment and insulin resistance.", 
    "56": "There is a lack of research on why physicians select a certain drug in an individual case and not another available alternative, although this drug selection process is important for quality assurance and cost control. Four hundred ninety-five psychiatrists documented in a standardized form patient and illness characteristics of 1711 schizophrenic outpatients who were switched for individual clinical reasons from an ongoing neuroleptic treatment to olanzapine, and of another 1654 schizophrenic outpatients whose present neuroleptic medication was continued. Physicians also filled in the \"Reason for Treatment Selection Questionnaire.\" Patients who were switched to olanzapine were more ill and showed more preexisting extrapyramidal symptoms and less patient compliance. Reasons of psychiatrists to switch to olanzapine were the expectation of better efficacy and tolerability of the present treatment and patient preferences to continue with the present medication. The price of olanzapine is seen as a reason not to select olanzapine but has no effect on the treatment decision. The \"physician drug stereotype\" of olanzapine corresponds with clinical data on the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine. The data show that medical decisions about drug selection are multidimensional, integrating knowledge about the clinical properties of the drug, personal experiences and information about the individual case. The Reason for Treatment Selection Questionnaire is an instrument that allows to objectively assess important aspects of medical decision making, to generate psychological drug profile, and to understand why physicians prefer one drug over alternatives.",

To investigate their characteristics further, the enzymatic reactions of the two CYP3A enzymes were compared using midazolam, nifedipine, testosterone and terfenadine as substrates. Both CYP3A5 and CYP3A4 showed sigmoid and substrate inhibition patterns for testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation and terfenadine t-butylhydroxylation (TFDOH), respectively. In the other reactions, the kinetic model for CYP3A5 was not similar to that for CYP3A4. An inhibition study demonstrated that the interactions between alpha-naphthoflavone (alphaNF) and CYP3A substrates were different for the two CYP3A enzymes. alphaNF stimulated nifedipine oxidation catalysed by CYP3A5, but did not stimulate that catalysed by CYP3A4. alphaNF at less than 32 microM inhibited TFDOH catalysed by CYP3A5, but did not inhibit that catalysed by CYP3A4.

A regular increase in these fatal intoxications has been recorded, in Belgium as in other countries, due, in particular, to an intensified prescription of this product, of which illicit use as street dope becomes problematic. Over the 30 months period covered by the study, 26 deaths related to methadone were listed, of which 3 occurred in accidental circumstances. In the other 23 cases, methadone can be found, yet always associated with psychotropic substances, mainly benzodiazepines (18 cases), narcotics (15 cases) and finally alcohol (5 cases). Based upon the nature of the products combined with methadone, records have been divided in two groups: In the first group (17 observations), xenobiotics at (infra)therapeutic levels are detected. In the other group (6 observations), xenobiotics at high and toxic levels are detected. Blood methadone concentrations are not so different between the 2 groups of individuals since the median values and the extreme values are worth respectively 308, and 110-11300 microg/L, for the first group and 776 and 93-2080 microg/L for the second group. There is thus an important overlap between the therapeutic blood methadone concentrations (150-400 microg/L) and blood concentrations observed in fatalities.Thus, it is necessary that all information and post-mortem results must be examined in a critical way to identify and justify cause of the death.", 
    "67": "Pro bio Qual Association of Lyon have proposed a control which include the control for detecting benzodiazepines (BZD) and tricyclic antidepressants (ADT) since 2000. With this control, we have evaluated the specificity and the sensitivity of techniques used. We have tested the maprotiline reactivity too (tetracyclic antidepressant). We report results achieved with different immunoassay methods and their performances: specificity and sensitivity. The number of laboratories which realize these analyses is constant: these laboratories are hospital laboratories. Two methods are most common used: the fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and the enzyme multiplied immunoassay test (EMIT). The evolution of these techniques does square with the evolution of chemistry analysers used in hospital laboratories. For the BZD, the specificity is good. For the ADT, carbamazepine at low concentration (5 mg/L) gives a positive result with FPIA Abbott assay; carbamazepine at high concentration (25 mg/L) gives a negative result with EMIT assay; phenothiazines give a positive response. For the BZD, the analyser Integra gives best results of sensitivity. Results of sensitivity obtained with the kit EMIT DAU are better than results obtained with the kit EMIT Serum. For the ADT, results of sensitivity obtained with FPIA Abbott assay seem better; the adaptation of EMIT assay on Integra analyser gives less good results. The reactivity for the BZD is very different: we can ignore a severe intoxication with alprazolam or lorazepam (response < cut off) but we can give a positive result for a therapeutic concentration of diazepam for example. With ADT, we haven't the same problem. But the reactivity for nortriptyline is less good than the reactivity for amitriptyline. So we should use a \"cut off\" concentration which corresponds to the best sensitivity and the best specificity.", 
    "68": "We report here that chlorpromazine, a first generation antipsychotic drug, inhibits anionic amino acid transport mediated by system X(-) (AG) (EAAT transporters) in cultured human fibroblasts. With 30 microM chlorpromazine, transport inhibition is detectable after 3 h of treatment, maximal after 48 h (>60%), and referable to a decrease in V(max). Chlorpromazine effect is not dependent upon changes of membrane potential and is selective for system X(-) (AG) since transport systems A and y(+) are not affected. Among antipsychotic drugs, the inhibitory effect of chlorpromazine is shared by two dibenzodiazepines, clozapine and olanzapine, while other compounds, such as risperidon, zuclopentixol, sertindol and haloperidol, are not effective. Transport inhibition by clozapine and olanzapine, but not by chlorpromazine, is reversible, suggesting that the mechanisms involved are distinct. These results indicate that a subset of antipsychotic drugs inhibits EAAT transporters in non-nervous tissues and prompt further investigation on possible alterations of glutamate transport in peripheral tissues of schizophrenic patients.",

Our search for serotonergic drugs in affective illnesses and related disorders led to new off-label indications for fluoxetine, sertraline, tryptophan, clonazepam, alprazolam, tomoxetine, buproprion, duloxetine, risperidone and gabapentin. Various clinical trial designs were used for these proof-of-concept studies. Novel therapeutic uses of benzodiazepines, such as in panic disorder and mania, were found with the introduction of 2 high-potency benzodiazepines, clonazepam and alprazolam, which were thought to have serotonergic properties. Our initial clinical trials of fluoxetine and sertraline led to their approved indications in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, and our trials of gabapentin led to new indications in anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety, panic attack and social phobia) and sleep disorders (insomnia).", 
    "70": "Although it is now more than two decades since it was first reported that the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-4513 reverses behavioral alcohol effects, the molecular target(s) of Ro15-4513 and the mechanism of alcohol antagonism remain elusive. Here, we show that Ro15-4513 blocks the alcohol enhancement on recombinant \"extrasynaptic\" alpha4/6beta3delta GABA(A) receptors at doses that do not reduce the GABA-induced Cl(-) current. At low ethanol concentrations (< or =30 mM), the Ro15-4513 antagonism is complete. However, at higher ethanol concentrations (> or =100 mM), there is a Ro15-4513-insensitive ethanol enhancement that is abolished in receptors containing a point mutation in the second transmembrane region of the beta3 subunit (beta3N265M). Therefore, alpha4/6beta3delta GABA receptors have two distinct alcohol modulation sites: (i) a low-dose ethanol site present in alpha4/6beta3delta receptors that is antagonized by the behavioral alcohol antagonist Ro15-4513 and (ii) a site activated at high (anesthetic) alcohol doses, defined by mutations in membrane-spanning regions. Receptors composed of alpha4beta3N265Mdelta subunits that lack the high-dose alcohol site show a saturable ethanol dose-response curve with a half-maximal enhancement at 16 mM, close to the legal blood alcohol driving limit in most U.S. states (17.4 mM). Like in behavioral experiments, the alcohol antagonist effect of Ro15-4513 on recombinant alpha4beta3delta receptors is blocked by flumazenil and beta-carboline-ethyl ester (beta-CCE). Our findings suggest that ethanol/Ro15-4513-sensitive GABA(A) receptors are important mediators of behavioral alcohol effects.",

Seven commonly misused substances (amphetamine, benzodiazepine, barbiturates, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone and opiates) and alcohol were tested in the urine. A total of 16 (10.7%) women were found positive and all 16 of them had denied use of any substance. Amphetamine was the most common among the substances misused. A total of 12 out of the 16 were from social classes 4 and 5. None of the positive women was nulliparous. Because of the difficulty in identifying substance misuse in pregnant women, consideration should be given to the implementation of routine substance screening at the booking antenatal visit in general population with a high incidence of substance misuse.",

Assessing the elements of the syndrome for the presence of depression, psychosis, mania, or catatonia, offers opportunities for systematic intervention. Since almost all descriptions of autism highlight the presence of motor symptoms that characterize catatonia, an assessment for this eminently treatable syndrome is recommended for all patients considered to be autistic. A minimum examination includes a catatonia rating scale and for those patients with defined catatonia, a lorazepam test. For those whose catatonia responds to lorazepam, high dose lorazepam therapy is recommended. If this fails, electroconvulsive therapy is recommended. The assessment and treatment of catatonia offers positive medical therapy for the victims of autism and their families.",

Animals either received tracer quantities of [(3)H]flumazenil 3min before being killed for the in vivo binding, or were killed and brain homogenates incubated with 1.8nM [(3)H]flumazenil. The flumazenil dose required to inhibit in vivo binding of [(3)H]flumazenil by 50% (ID(50)) was 2.0mg/kg, which represents the most accurate measure of benzodiazepine site occupancy by flumazenil in vivo. Occupancy measured in crude brain homogenates using the ex vivo method was time dependent with a 3mg/kg dose giving occupancies of 77% and 12% using 0.5 or 60min ex vivo incubations times, respectively, presumably due to dissociation from the binding site during the ex vivo incubation. When incubation time was minimised (0.5min), and despite being under non-equilibrium conditions, the ex vivo method gave an ID(50) of 1.5mg/kg which was not too dissimilar from that observed using in vivo binding (2.0mg/kg). As expected, ex vivo binding can give an underestimation of receptor occupancy but this can be minimised by careful attention to the kinetics of unlabelled drug and radioligand.",

Multiple 1-mm pustules appeared on the whole body, concentrated especially on her neck and face. Within 2 days, the eruption was increasingly accompanied by erythema and pruritus. No fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias or myalgias were recorded. The diagnosis was corroborated by hystopathology. After 7 days of treatment, olanzapine and valproate were stopped. Concomitantly, cetirizine 20 mg p.o. and methylprednisolone 500 mg i.v. were given once. During the following week betamethasone cream was applied, and the pustular eruption resolved completely.", 
    "83": "The antistress effects of BR-16A, a polyherbal preparation and its interaction with GABAergic modulators against social isolation-induced stress were investigated in the present study. Isolation stress was induced by keeping the mice (Laca strain) individually in each cage for 3 weeks and various drug treatments were given for a period of 5 days before the start of the experiments. The various behavioural parameters examined included pentobarbitone-induced sleep (sleep latency and duration), analgesia (tail-ssick test) and locomotor activity, respectively. BR-16A (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) treatment for 5 days significantly reversed the social isolation stress-induced prolongation of onset and decrease in pentobarbitone-induced sleep, increased total motor activity and stress-induced antinociception. When diazepam (0.5 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine agonist, was co-administered with BR-16A (100 mg/kg), it significantly potentiated the reversal of pentobarbitone-induced shortening of sleep time effects; increased locomotor activity and stress induced antinociceptive effects. However, the sleep latency was not decreased significantly. Further, ssumazenil (2 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist and FG 7142 (10 mg/kg), an inverse agonist, when co-administered with BR-16A (100 mg/kg), showed no significant reversal on pentobarbitone-induced hypnosis, locomotor activity and social isolation-induced antinociception compared with their effects per se. The present study demonstrated the antistress effects of BR-16A preparation against social isolation-induced stress. The present study also suggests that the GABAergic system may be involved in its antistress effect.", 
    "84": "Expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) has been found in every tissue examined; however, it is most abundant in steroid-producing tissues. Although the primary function of PBR is the regulation of steroidogenesis, its existence in nonsteroidogenic tissues as well as in other cellular compartments including the nucleus suggests that there may be other roles for PBR. Our laboratory reported earlier a significant increase of PBR density in the nucleus of DMBA-induced malignant submandibular glands of rats, suggesting a role of PBR in nuclear events of peripheral tissues. Since then numerous studies have demonstrated the abundance of PBR in tumors. Numerous studies implicate a role for cholesterol in the mechanisms underlying cell proliferation and cancer progression. Based on studies with a battery of human breast cancer cell lines and several human tissue biopsies, Hardwick et al. suggested that PBR expression, nuclear localization, and PBR-mediated cholesterol transport into the nucleus are involved in human breast cancer cell proliferation and aggressive phenotype expression. The purpose of the present study is to confirm this hypothesis by developing an animal breast cancer model and correlating the above events with the breast cancer. Weanling rats were maintained on a diet containing animal protein (casein) for 30 days and then a single dose of DMBA in sesame oil (80 mg/kg) was administered by gavage to the animals. Control animals received the vehicle only. After 122 days of DMBA administration, the animals were sacrificed. All tumors were detected by palpation. B(max) of PBRs was 52.6% and 128.4% higher in the non-aggressive and aggressive cancer tissues, respectively, than that in normal tissues. Cholesterol uptake into isolated nuclei was found to be higher in both non-aggressive and aggressive tumor breast tissue than that in control tissue. There was also corresponding increase in B(max) of PBRs in the nucleus of cancer tissues. Furthermore, the nuclear nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activity was found to be higher in aggressive tumor tissues than that in non-aggressive tumor tissues. In conclusion, these data suggest that PBR ligand binding, and PBR-mediated cholesterol transport into the nucleus may be involved in the development of mammary gland adenocarcinoma, thus participating in the advancement of the disease.", 
    "85": "The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate has been implicated in both migraine and persistent pain. The identification of the kainate receptor GLU(K5) in dorsal root ganglia, the dorsal horn, and trigeminal ganglia makes it a target of interest for these indications. We examined the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of the competitive GLU(K5)-selective kainate receptor antagonist LY466195 [(3S,4aR,6S,8aR)-6-[[(2S)-2-carboxy-4,4-difluoro-1-pyrrolidinyl]-methyl]decahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxylic acid)], the most potent GLU(K5) antagonist described to date. Comparisons were made to the competitive GLU(K5)/alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist LY293558 [(3S,4aR,6R,8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl]-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid], other decahydroisoquinoline GLU(K5) receptor antagonists, and the noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist LY300168 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodi-azepine]. When characterized electrophysiologically in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, LY466195 antagonized kainate (30 microM)-induced currents with an IC50 value of 0.045 +/- 0.011 microM. In HEK293 cells transfected with GLU(K5), GLU(K2)/GLU(K5), or GLU(K5)/GLU(K6) receptors, LY466195 produced IC50 values of 0.08 +/- 0.02, 0.34 +/- 0.17, and 0.07 +/- 0.02 microM, respectively. LY466195 was efficacious in a dural plasma protein extravasation (PPE) model of migraine with an ID100 value of 100 microg/kg i.v. LY466195 was also efficacious in the c-fos migraine model, with a dose of 1 microg/kg i.v. significantly reducing the number of Fos-positive cells in the rat nucleus caudalis after electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. Furthermore, LY466195 showed no contractile activity in the rabbit saphenous vein in vitro. The diethyl ester prodrug of LY466195 was also efficacious in the same PPE and c-fos models after oral administration at doses of 10 and 100 microg/kg, respectively while having no N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist-like behavioral effects at oral doses up to 100 mg/kg.",

    "88": "A 33-year-old African American man presented for evaluation of hypertriglyceridemia. His medical history was remarkable for schizophrenia necessitating ongoing olanzapine therapy for the past 6 years. A few months after olanzapine treatment was begun, he noted the development of nontender, firm, papular skin lesions on his elbows and knees. His family history was negative for lipid disorders or premature vascular disease. Physical examination revealed the presence of prominent tuberous xanthomas on both elbows and knees. Results of a lipid panel demonstrated a total cholesterol level of 374 mg/dL (9.7 mmol/L) and triglycerides of 828 mg/dL (9.3 mmol/L). A work-up for causes of secondary hyper-triglyceridemia was negative. Results of apoE genotyping by a commercial laboratory showed the E3/E3 genotype, based on gene sequencing at codons 112 and 158. Because the skin lesions were typical for type III HLP, his entire apoE gene was sequenced. This analysis revealed an apoE2/E2 (arginine 145 to cysteine) mutation, previously reported to be a rare cause of type III HLP in 5 patients of African descent. Triglyceride-lowering therapy with gem-fibrozil was initiated, in addition to lifestyle modification. At follow-up several months later, total cholesterol was 276 mg/dL (7.14 mmol/L) and triglycerides were 479 mg/dL (5.41 mmol/L).",

    "90": "Most hypnotic medications currently on the market target some aspect of GABAergic neurotransmission. Although all such compounds increase sleep, these drugs differentially affect the activity of the cerebral cortex as measured by the electroencephalogram. Whereas benzodiazepine medications such as triazolam tend to suppress slow wave activity in the cortex, the GABA(B) ligand gamma-hydroxybutyrate greatly enhances slow wave activity and the non-benzodiazepine, zolpidem, which binds to the omega1 site on the GABA(A) receptor/Cl(-) ionophore complex, is intermediate in this regard. Our previous studies have demonstrated that a small number of genes exhibit increased expression in the cerebral cortex of the mouse and rat during recovery sleep after sleep deprivation: egr-3, fra-2, grp78, grp94, ngfi-b, and nr4a3. Using these genes as a panel of biomarkers associated with sleep, we asked whether hypnotic medications induce similar molecular changes in the rat cerebral cortex to those observed when both sleep continuity and slow wave activity are enhanced during recovery sleep. We find that, although each drug increases the expression of a subset of genes in the panel of biomarkers, no drug fully replicates the molecular changes in the cortex associated with recovery sleep. Furthermore, high levels of slow wave activity in the cortex are correlated with increased expression of fra-2 whereas the expression of grp94 is correlated with body temperature. These results demonstrate that sleep-related changes in gene expression may be affected by physiological covariates of sleep and wakefulness rather than by vigilance state per se.", 
    "91": "For this first of a two-part article, anesthetic treatment modalities and specific drugs administered for third molar extractions were assessed to determine current office-based therapeutic practices. Questionnaires were mailed to a random national sample of 850 practicing oral surgeons. Survey design and pilot testing was conducted to assure clarity of questions and usefulness of responses. To maximize the response rate, two follow-up letters were sent to non-responders after the initial mailing. Completed questionnaires were returned by 563 practitioners (66.2% response rate). Practicing oral and maxillofacial surgeons were estimated to have performed an average of 52.7 third molar extraction surgery cases per month, using either general anesthesia (46.3%), intravenous conscious sedation (33.4%), nitrous oxide sedation (5.8%), oral sedation (1.7%), or local anesthesia alone (12.9%). For intravenous conscious sedation, a three-drug technique using midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol was reported most commonly. The most frequently selected local anesthetic formulations were 2% lidocaine, 1:100,000 epinephrine for surgical anesthesia and 0.5% bupivacaine, 1:200,000 epinephrine for postoperative pain management.", 
    "92": "Sleep disorders, such as insomnia and nightmares, are common problems in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), exert a strong negative influence on the quality of life and are a great challenge for clinical psychiatry. Several studies have reported on the efficacy of drugs for the treatment of PTSD-related sleep disorders. These studies have not been systematically reviewed. This is the first review on the effectiveness of sleep medication in PTSD. We performed a Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Library Indexed search, using the keywords: PTSD, pharmacotherapy, therapy, sleep, nightmares, insomnia and review. From this database, English-language, human subject, data driven papers published after 1980 were selected. Forty eight articles are discussed. Open-label and case studies suggest efficacy for some antidepressants, anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics. Only a few placebo-controlled studies have been published. They show promising results for the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine, and the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. In comparison to the incidence and impact of sleep complaints in PTSD, the pharmacotherapeutic armamentarium for PTSD-related sleep complaints remains poorly investigated. Some recent studies show promising results, especially for alpha1-adrenoceptor and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. However, randomized controlled trials with larger populations need to be conducted.",

It has been reported that the density of PBR is related to brain damage, so a reliable tracer method for the evaluation of PBR would be of use. We evaluated a quantification method of [(11)C]DAA1106 binding in simulated data and human brain data. In the simulation study, the reliability of parameters estimated from the nonlinear least-squares (NLS) method, graphical analysis (GA), and multilinear analysis (MA) was evaluated. In GA, variation of the estimated distribution volume (DV) was small. However, DV was underestimated as noise increased. In MA, bias was smaller, and variation of the estimated DV was larger than in GA. In NLS, although variation was larger than in GA, it was small enough in regions of interest analysis, and not only DV but also binding potential (BP), determined from the k(3)/k(4) without any constraint, could be estimated. The variation of BP estimated with NLS became larger as k(3) or k(4) became smaller. In human studies with normal volunteers, regions of interest were drawn on several brain regions, BP was calculated by NLS, and DV was also estimated by NLS, GA, and MA. As a result, DVs estimated with each method were well correlated. However, there was no correlation between BP with NLS and DV with NLS, GA, and MA, because of the variation of K(1)/k(2) between individuals. In conclusion, BP is estimated most reliably by NLS with the two-tissue compartment model.", 
    "98": "The bioavailability (F) of midazolam in cynomolgus monkeys (0.02) was markedly lower than that in humans (0.24-0.46) and the reason for this difference in F between the two species was investigated. Based on the area under the plasma concentration-time curve after intravenous and intraportal infusion to cynomolgus monkeys, the hepatic availability (F(h)) was estimated as 0.66. The fraction of dose absorbed (F(a)) estimated from the single-pass intestinal perfusion method was 1.0 in cynomolgus monkeys. The intestinal availability (F(g) = F/F(a)/F(h)) was calculated as 0.03 in cynomolgus monkeys. Since the F(a) of midazolam has been reported to be almost 1.0 in humans, F(h) and F(g) were calculated as 0.33-0.76 and 0.46-1.00 when the reference values for hepatic blood flow (1026-1530 ml h(-1) kg(-1)) were used. In conclusion, the main reason for low F in cynomolgus monkeys was the markedly higher first-pass intestinal metabolism seen in cynomolgus monkeys compared with humans.",

The routes of metabolism of this compound in rat, dog, rhesus monkey and human in vitro systems, and in vivo in rat, dog and rhesus monkey have been characterized. The current study demonstrates that both a cytosolic oxidative reaction and cytochrome P450 play important roles in the metabolism of the compound. Chemical inhibition studies showed the oxidation in human cytosol to be catalysed predominantly by aldehyde oxidase rather than the related enzyme, xanthine oxidase. The aldehyde oxidase-mediated metabolites were present in vitro and in vivo in both rat and rhesus monkey, and also in vitro in man. They were absent both in vitro and in vivo in dog.", 
    "100": "According to contemporary views, the glutamatergic system is implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and atypical neuroleptics exert their effects (at least partially) through the glutamatergic system. Immunoreactive glutamate-metabolising enzymes, such as glutamine synthetase-like protein (GSLP) and two glutamate dehydrogenase isoenzymes (GDH), have been discovered in human platelets. The amount of GSLP in the platelets of 40 chronic patients with schizophrenia was found to be significantly higher than in 33 controls (consistent with our previous finding of increased amounts of GSLP in the prefrontal cortex of chronic schizophrenia patients). Moreover, survival analysis of the group of patients treated with olanzapine for 28 weeks showed that the larger amount of GSLP measured in platelets before treatment, the shorter the treatment time needed to achieve a positive clinical response (defined a priori as > or = 20% reduction in PANSS total score from the initial level before the treatment). Hence, GSLP level may serve as a predictor of the treatment duration to achieve a positive outcome with olanzapine. Both GSLP and GDH were found significantly changed in the course of treatment; hence, treatment with olanzapine influences the amounts of glutamate-metabolising enzymes in the platelets of chronic schizophrenia patients.", 
    "101": "The aim of this study was to evaluate diazepam and oxazepam as cytochrome P450 inducers at doses previously shown to cause liver tumors in mice but not rats. In rats, diazepam and oxazepam induced CYP2B, and were as effective as phenobarbital despite lacking phenobarbital's tumor-promoting effect in rats. In mice, diazepam and oxazepam induced both CYP2B and CYP4A at dietary doses associated with liver tumor formation. It remains to be determined why diazepam and oxazepam induce CYP4A in mice but not rats and whether this difference accounts for the apparent species difference in the tumor-promoting activity of diazepam and oxazepam.",

A high sensitive gas chromatography nitrogen phosphorous detection (GC-NPD) bioanalytical method was developed and validated for the purpose of pharmacokinetic study of tofisopam. A liquid-liquid extraction method was used for the sample preparation. The mean recovery for tofisopam was 69.8% and the inter- and intra-day precision values were well below the 15% limit established for bioanalytical methods. A similar compound, girizopam was used as internal standard. The assay was linear in the 5-500 ng/ml range corresponding to therapeutically relevant plasma levels. The concentrations of the compound were measured in the plasma samples of 12 healthy male volunteers and the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from the plasma concentration-time data. A rapid absorption and distribution, relatively short biological half-life and considerable inter-individual variation in the plasma concentration levels of parent compound were the main characteristics of the pharmacokinetics of tofisopam. According to these results, the new (GC-NPD) bioanalytical method proved to be capable of measuring concentration of tofisopam in human plasma and was successfully applied in a single dose pharmacokinetic study.", 
    "115": "Genotype/phenotype analysis with human hepatocytes has identified a new inactive CYP2D6 allele, CYP2D6*56. Cryopreserved human hepatocytes from 51 livers were evaluated for CYP2D6 activity with dextromethorphan as the probe substrate. Hepatocyte lots that lacked CYP2D6 activity were further evaluated for CYP2D6 expression and known genetic variations, including CYP2D6*2, *3, *4, *5, *6, *7, *8, *9, *10, *11, *14, *15, *17, *18, *19, *20, *25, *26, *29, *30, *35, *40, *41, *43, and various multiple copy CYP2D6 alleles (*1xn, *2xn, and *4xn) by the AmpliChip CYP450 prototype microarray (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Branchburg, NJ). Two discrepancies were uncovered between the CYP2D6 genotype and activity by this approach. In one sample, a previously unreported 3201C 224 T transition in exon 7 resulted in Arg344(CGA) being replaced by a stop codon (TGA), resulting in a CYP2D6 enzyme lacking the terminal 153 amino acids. This allele was given the designation of CYP2D6*56 and the GenBank accession number DQ282162. The lack of CYP2D6 activity in cryopreserved hepatocytes and microsomes found in the second sample, despite a normal level of CYP2D6 expression and a genotype (*10/*1) predictive of normal CYP2D6 activity, was attributed to enzyme inactivation by an unknown metabolite. The identification and characterization of the CYP2D6*56 allele indicates that commercial cryopreserved human hepatocytes may provide a valuable means to rapidly identify genetic variations with functional relevance. This integrated approach of identifying alleles and examining allele relationships to gene expression and function could be of tremendous value to understanding the mechanism responsible for functional differences in gene variation. The commercial availability of human cryopreserved hepatocytes also makes this potential readily available to any who are interested in it, not just those with access to private liver banks.", 
    "116": "Neonatal treatment of Long-Evans Hooded rats with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor (CSI) AY9944 has been shown to increase occurrence of spike-waves in EEG recordings and decrease benzodiazepines sensitivity of GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses in neurons from the thalamic reticular nuclei (nRt, Wu et al., 2004). The present experiments were designed to investigate the changes in the gamma2 and alpha1 subunits of the GABA(A) receptor in CSI model rats as possible mechanisms of these changes. Western blot, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR techniques were performed to measure the levels of GABA(A) receptor gamma2 and alpha1 subunit transcripts and protein in the nRt and ventrobasal (VB) relay nuclei of thalamus and in somatosensory cortex. In CSI model animals, Western blot results showed that gamma2 subunit expression significantly decreased in thalamus (control, n=6: 0.17+/-0.02 relative to actin vs. CSI model, n=6: 0.11+/-0.01, P<0.05) but neither in cortex nor in hippocampal tissues. Conversely, alpha1 subunit expression decreased in CSI model somatosensory cortex, but not in nRt and VB. The present results demonstrate that neonatal block of cholesterol synthesis produces region- and subunit-specific decreases in GABA(A) receptor subunits in thalamus and cortex. Selective reductions in GABA(A) receptor subunits in thalamus may play a role in pathophysiology of absence epilepsy.", 
    "117": "On the basis of in vitro studies indicating that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inducer and a pregnane X receptor activator and because the pregnane X receptor is a transcriptional regulator of multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1)/P-glycoprotein (P-gp), we postulated that UDCA might decrease the bioavailability of CYP3A4 and P-gp probe drugs in humans. The main objective of this study was to determine whether UDCA alters the pharmacokinetics of digoxin and midazolam. The secondary objective was to determine whether the intestinal expression of P-gp and CYP3A4 is increased by UDCA.", 
    "118": "The effect of UDCA on MDR1 and CYP3A4 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was investigated in human colon carcinoma cell lines LS174T and Caco-2. Eight healthy volunteers participated in this open, nonrandomized 2-period study, in which the effects of UDCA (13 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) during 2 weeks) versus control on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.5-mg single intravenous infusion), d3-digoxin (3-fold deuterated digoxin, 0.5-mg single oral dose), and midazolam (7.5-mg single oral dose) were compared. Duodenal biopsy specimens were obtained during both periods to quantify MDR1/P-gp and CYP3A4 expression.", 
    "119": "In vitro UDCA induced MDR1 and CYP3A4 mRNA in Caco-2 cells but not in LS174T cells. In humans UDCA significantly decreased the extent of digoxin absorption from 0.77 to 0.70 and the oral d3-digoxin area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 hours from 6.4 +/- 1.7 ng.h.mL(-1) to 5.3 +/- 1.5 ng.h.mL(-1) (P = .01 and P = .05, respectively). UDCA had no detectable effects on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam or the intestinal mRNA and protein expression levels of MDR1/P-gp and CYP3A4.", 
    "120": "Under the conditions in our study, UDCA only modestly decreased digoxin disposition without detectable changes in midazolam pharmacokinetics. The clinical relevance of these findings remains to be determined.", 
    "121": "Escitalopram, the active enantiomer of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, has effects in animal models for the detection of antidepressant and anxiolytic effect and in patients with major depressive and anxiety disorders. In the present study, the effects of escitalopram in the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG) stimulation model of panic anxiety were investigated and compared to a number of clinically used anti-panic agents. The SSRIs, citalopram (ED(50) 6.6mg/kg), fluoxetine (ED(50) 13.6mg/kg), paroxetine (ED(50) 2.9mg/kg) and the benzodiazepine ligand, alprazolam (ED(50) 0.3mg/kg) all reduced the flight-like escape behaviour produced by electrical stimulation of the dPAG in the rat, this is presumed to indicate a reduction in fear and/or physical sensation and is interpreted as an anti-panic effect of the drugs. Escitalopram (ED(50) 3.1mg/kg) also significantly reduced flight behaviour indicating the anti-panic potential of the compound; it is suggested that escitalopram will be twice as potent as citalopram in this context.", 
    "122": "A sensitive and selective method was developed for the determination of the antipsychotic drug Olanzapine levels in rat brain tissue, based on HPLC with electrochemical detection. The analyses were carried out on a C8 reversed phase column (150 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm), using a mobile phase composed of methanol and a phosphate buffer (44.0 mM, pH 3.5), containing triethylamine (21:79, v/v), flowing at 1.2 mL min(-1). A high sensitivity coulometric detection analytical cell containing two flow-through low volume working electrodes was used: electrode 1 was set at +0.350 V and electrode 2 at -0.200 V. Olanzapine, administered to rats in different doses or in different times, was extracted from tissue homogenate of either the whole brain or specific areas (cortex, hyppocampus, nucleus striatum) with a rapid solid phase extraction procedure (SPE) on Oasis HLB cartridges. The method provided a high extraction yield of Olanzapine and internal standard (2-methylolanzapine) from brain tissue homogenate with absolute recovery values higher than 90.0%. The detector response was linear over a concentration range of 0.2-100.0 ng mL(-1) of Olanzapine. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.2 ng mL(-1). Precision results, expressed by the intra-day and the inter-day relative standard deviation values, were satisfactory, better than 4.6%. Accuracy was satisfactory as well. This method proved to be suitable for the analysis of Olanzapine in rat brain tissues and for the study of distribution and pharmacokinetics of Olanzapine in rat brain after a single treatment with the antipsychotic drug.", 
    "123": "The patient with acute extrapyramidal signs and symptoms presents a significant clinical challenge. We present the case of a young man who developed an acute akathisia and dystonia after inadvertent overdose of olanzapine (Zyprexa) in the setting of a recent discontinuation of fluoxetine. The receptor chemistry and mechanisms pertinent to his presentation are reviewed. An analysis of the literature indicates that a broad incidence range is cited for the extrapyramidal effects of these medications. We suggest a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the undifferentiated patient presenting with extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. The possibility of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome (SS), tricyclic overdose, and cocaine abuse should be considered in a patient with extrapyramidal signs and symptoms, given the potential for complications. An emphasis is placed on the need for carefully verbalized discharge instructions to avoid a potential untoward outcome.", 
    "124": "Allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnane-20-one) is a ring-A-reduced metabolite of progesterone, which is naturally produced during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy and by stressful events. The steroid hormone inhibits neural functions through increased chloride ion flux through the GABA(A) receptor. The effects and subsequent withdrawal symptoms are similar to those caused by alcohol, benzodiazepines and barbiturates. This study examined the withdrawal effects of progesterone with regards to the influence of individual baseline exploration and risk taking. Rats were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM) before hormonal treatment, in order to evaluate differences in risk taking and exploration of open and elevated areas. Treatment consisted of ten consecutive once a day progesterone or vehicle s.c. injections. On the last day of treatment, estradiol was injected in addition to progesterone, followed by a 24-h withdrawal before testing in the open field test (OF). Progesterone-treated rats showed a withdrawal effect of open area avoidance in the OF. The vehicle-treated control rats showed strong correlations between the EPM and OF parameters. This relationship was not found for the progesterone group at withdrawal. Rats with greater numbers of open arm entrance in the EPM pretest showed an increased sensitivity to progesterone withdrawal (PWD) compared to rats with low exploration and risk taking. The results indicate that the effects of PWD relate to individual exploration and risk taking. Furthermore, the possible analogy of PWD and PMS/PMDD in relation to individual traits is discussed.", 
    "125": "Method development for a heterocyclic library which entails novel scaffolds of benzodiazepines fused with various heterocycles, such as pyrimidines, indolines, and tetrahydroquinolines, was accomplished. The new synthetic strategy is based on an electrophilic cyclization reaction involving an iminium intermediate formed by the corresponding aminopyrimidine with a carbonyl compound to give the desired heterocycles in high yields. Subsequent replacement of the chloro group in the resulted structures with a nucleophile, such as boronic acids, amines, alcohols and thiols, led to a library of privileged compounds with up to eight accessible diversity points.", 
    "126": "Continuous monitoring is of paramount importance in order to obtain a correct level of sedation in ICU patients. Clinical scoring systems, although simple and inexpensive, are often inadequate in evaluating the patient level of consciousness. Among instrumental tools for sedation monitoring, Bispectral Index (BIS) is now widely used due to its reliability and applicability. Nevertheless some doubts still exist regarding its usefulness in ICU.", 
    "127": "Sedation, obtained with propofol or midazolam, was monitored with Ramsay scale and BIS in 40 patients admitted in ICU for postoperative monitoring after major abdominal or vascular surgery. A correlation between Ramsay score and BIS values was searched using Pearson test.", 
    "128": "A good correlation between Ramsay score and BIS values was observed. At the deeper levels of sedation a wide range of BIS values corresponds to Ramsay score 6, indicating various levels of central nervous system depression that are not identified by clinical evaluation.",

    "131": "Intake treatment data were examined for the first 500 patients in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study (1998 to 1999). Diagnoses were assessed by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV mood modules. Data on treatments were obtained by interviewing patients during the initial psychiatric examination.", 
    "132": "Of the 500 participants, 73.6 percent had bipolar I disorder, 23.0 percent had bipolar II disorder, and 3.4 percent had bipolar disorder not otherwise specified. Upon examination, 63.4 percent were euthymic, 24.6 percent were depressed, and 12.0 percent were experiencing manic, hypomanic, or mixed states. Standard mood stabilizers (lithium, valproate, or carbamazepine) were the most commonly prescribed class of drugs that participants were taking at intake (71.9 percent). The next most common class of agents was antidepressants (40.6 percent), followed by novel anticonvulsants (31.8 percent), second-generation neuroleptics (27.2 percent), and benzodiazepines (25.0 percent). Eleven percent of patients were treated with standard mood stabilizer monotherapy. These prescribing patterns were further analyzed by subtype of illness and compared with patterns in other clinical and community settings.", 
    "133": "In a large, well-characterized cross-sectional analysis of prescription patterns in the U.S. psychiatric academic setting, patients with bipolar disorder were primarily treated with standard mood stabilizers, followed by moderate use of antidepressants, novel anticonvulsants, and second-generation neuroleptics. Results can be useful in understanding the current clinical standard of care, as well as in guiding research studies toward areas in which there is a relative absence of evidence to inform clinical practice. Studies of longitudinal prescribing patterns in bipolar disorder are also needed.",

There are estimated to be approximately 100,000 BD addicts in Denmark. This article describes a simple but effective method of reducing the use of addictive drugs in clinical practice.", 
    "135": "Two solo clinics in Thybor\u00f8n-Harbo\u00f8re Community decided to work strictly according to directive CIR no. 12 of 13 January 2003. All BDs and CPs were prescribed for one month at a time and could be renewed only by the doctor after a personal consultation. This monthly requirement forced the doctor as well as the patient to evaluate whether the existing prescription pattern or a drug-reducing regime was indicated. The prescription pattern was monitored using Ordiprax, which showed the amount of prescription medicines sold by pharmacies.", 
    "136": "After 15 months, the patients\" use of BD was reduced by 50% and their use of CP by 75%. The process of changing prescription habits was far easier than expected. An entire group of patients, previously invisible to the doctors, was exposed. During the first three months, only four to five additional consultations for every 1,000 assigned patients were required each week. There was practically no need of any assistance from our usual partners, such as psychiatrists, hospitals, special wards for addictive treatment or primary health care.",

    "138": "One hundred and one patients suffering from chronic daily headache (CDH) and medication overuse were treated, in an in-patient setting, with abrupt discontinuation of the medication overused, intravenous hydrating, and intravenous administration of benzodiazepines and ademetionine. The mean time to CDH resolution was 8.8 days. The in-patient withdrawal protocol used was effective, safe and well tolerated. There was a trend for a shorter time to CDH resolution in patients who overused triptans (P=0.062). There was no correlation between time to CDH resolution and either the type of initial primary headache or duration of medication abuse, whereas time to CDH resolution was related to daily drug intake (P=0.01). In multiple regression analysis, daily drug intake, age and type of medication overused were independent predictors of time to CDH resolution. At 3-months' follow-up, no patient had relapsed and was again overusing symptomatic medications."
