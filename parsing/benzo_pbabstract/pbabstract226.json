Lorazepam tablets marketed by two manufacturers (Mylan Pharmaceuticals and Watson Laboratories) were used to extemporaneously formulate two independently prepared suspensions. Each suspension was prepared using sterile water, Ora-Plus(\u00ae) and Ora-Sweet(\u00ae) to achieve a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. The two brands of tablets required different volumes of vehicles to prepare a pharmaceutically optimal suspension. The suspensions were stored in amber glass bottles at 4\u00b0C and 22\u00b0C for 91 days. Samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography at baseline and on days 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 63, and 91. The suspensions were considered stable if the mean lorazepam concentration remained greater than 90% of the initial concentration.The chemical stabilities of these two extemporaneously prepared lorazepam suspensions were comparable throughout the study. Both lorazepam suspensions were stable for 63 days when stored at 4\u00b0C or 22\u00b0C, and both were stable for 91 days when refrigerated at 4\u00b0C. When stored at room temperature, the suspension prepared from the Watson tablet retained 88.9 \u00b1 1.4% of the initial concentration on day 91 and was therefore considered unstable, while the suspension prepared from the Mylan tablet was stable for the entire 91-day study.", 
    "1": "Preoperative pediatric anxiety is characterized by stress, worry, nervosism and concern and may be expressed in different ways. Postoperative behavior changes, such as nocturnal enuresis, dietary problems, apathy, insomnia, nightmares and agitated sleep may be results of this anxiety. In some children, these changes persist for one year. This study aimed at evaluating anxiety-related aspects affecting children and parents in the preoperative period, as well as pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions to minimize them.", 
    "2": "The relationship between preoperative anxiety in children and postoperative behavior changes, as well as the influence of variables such as age, temperament, previous hospital experience and pain are discussed. Approaches to decrease childrens preoperative anxiety, such as the presence of parents during anesthetic induction or information programs and preanesthetic medication are reviewed.", 
    "3": "The preoperative period is accompanied of an emotional overload for the whole family, especially the child. For many children, a turbulent preoperative period may translate into several behavior changes lasting for long periods of time. The presence of parents during anesthetic induction and the preoperative preparation of children and parents may be useful for selected cases, taking into account age, temperament and previous hospital experience. Preanesthetic medication with benzodiazepines, especially midazolam, is clearly the most effective method to decrease postoperative anxiety in children and their related behavior changes.", 
    "4": "Our purpose is to examine the effect of different classes of anxiolytics on cognitive flexibility.", 
    "5": "Situational stressors and anxiety impede performance on \"creativity\" tests requiring cognitive flexibility. Noradrenergic agents have been shown to modulate cognitive flexibility as assessed by performance on anagrams. To determine whether these findings on noradrenergic modulation of cognitive flexibility are specific to the noradrenergic system or are a nonspecific anxiety effect, we compared the effects of propranolol, lorazepam, and placebo on the anagram task.", 
    "6": "Subjects attended 3 test sessions. Prior to each session, subjects were given 1 of the 3 drugs. As in previous research, the natural log of the solution latency of each test item was summed for each test session and compared across drug conditions.", 
    "7": "For subjects able to solve the anagrams, solution times after propranolol, but not lorazepam, were significantly lower than after placebo.", 
    "8": "Therefore, this suggests that the phenomenon of noradrenergic modulation of cognitive flexibility does not result from a nonspecific anxiolytic effect, but rather is specific to the noradrenergic system.", 
    "9": "The effect of diazepam on NO-mediated cGMP synthesis was studied in rat brain slices. It was found that diazepam dose-dependently decreased cGMP synthesis in cerebellar slices, with an inhibition of 90% at 1 mM diazepam. cGMP levels in the presence of diazepam were not restored to control levels by the addition of 0.1 mM sodium nitroprusside, whereas the decrease in cerebellar cGMP levels induced by 0.1 mM L-NAME was restored by the simultaneous application of NO-donors. In addition to the decrease of cGMP levels in neuronal structures induced by 1 mM diazepam, we observed increased cGMP immunoreactivity in glial cells in the cerebellum, the hippocampus, and the cerebral cortex. The significance of this observation is discussed.",

    "12": "Participants were randomly assigned to receive either oral diazepam (15 mg/70 kg; n=10) or placebo (n=8) capsules nightly for 28 days. Effects of flumazenil (1 mg/70 kg, intravenously administered) were assessed in challenge sessions conducted before capsule ingestion, and after 1, 7, 14, and 28 days of capsule ingestion.", 
    "13": "Flumazenil produced a profile of participant-rated effects consistent with benzodiazepine withdrawal that peaked immediately after completion of the 5-min flumazenil injection and rapidly dissipated thereafter. The magnitude of these effects was comparable after 7, 14, and 28 days of diazepam. Flumazenil also produced modest elevations in blood pressure and decreases in skin temperature in the diazepam group, both of which were sustained throughout the approximate 60-min session.", 
    "14": "These findings support previous human research studies indicating that flumazenil precipitates withdrawal after short chronic exposure to benzodiazepines and suggests that duration of exposure does not influence the intensity of withdrawal beyond the first week of exposure.",

The mechanism for the fall in BNP has not been elucidated and the potential confounding effects of sedation have not been investigated. Sedation may alter BNP levels via its effects on loading conditions. Accordingly, we studied whether BNP levels change shortly after cardioversion and attempted to control for possible effects of sedation.",

By contrast, mean BNP did not fall in subjects in whom cardioversion was not successful. The change in BNP level was not related to the degree of change in heart rate. No control subject experienced a change in cardiac rhythm; BNP levels increased (195 +/- 407 vs. 238 +/- 458 pg/ml, p < 0.05) in 18/22 subjects after sedation. Baseline BNP levels were elevated in subjects with AF, and BNP levels were elevated in parallel with heart failure symptoms.",

    "19": "Pirenzepine is suggested to be a relatively selective muscarinic (M(1)) antagonist and is currently under investigation for the treatment of myopia. Atropine, a nonselective M-type antagonist, is used in the treatment of myopia, but has undesired ocular and systemic side effects. An M(1)-specific antagonist may decrease side effects and remain effective at reducing the progression of myopia. In the current study, the effects of pirenzepine on pupil diameter, resting refraction, and accommodation were studied in rhesus monkeys.", 
    "20": "The time course and extent of mydriasis from subconjunctival injection of 2% pirenzepine were determined in five normal rhesus monkeys, and the effects on static and dynamic accommodation were determined in four rhesus monkeys with permanent indwelling electrodes in the Edinger-Westphal (EW) nucleus of the midbrain. Subconjunctival injections of 0.0002% to 0.2% pirenzepine in log unit dilutions were tested in three monkeys to determine the effects on static EW-stimulated accommodation. At 40 to 50 minutes after pirenzepine injection, accommodation was stimulated pharmacologically in both eyes, and the response was measured for 30 minutes.", 
    "21": "After 2% pirenzepine injection, pupil size increased 2.02 +/- 0.41 mm, there was a hyperopic shift in resting refraction of 1.07 +/- 0.23 D, and nearly complete cycloplegia occurred. Maximum EW-stimulated accommodation was significantly decreased 20 to 40 minutes after 0.02% or greater pirenzepine. Carbachol-stimulated accommodation was significantly decreased after 0.2% or greater pirenzepine.", 
    "22": "Subconjunctival injections of 0.02% or greater pirenzepine result in a significant decrease in accommodation and are probably acting through nonselective muscarinic antagonism. Subconjunctival injections of 0.002% or less pirenzepine do not decrease EW-stimulated accommodation.", 
    "23": "Anxiety disorders are often associated with autonomic symptoms, including heart palpitations, sweating, elevation of body temperature and alterations of gastrointestinal motility. Some of the alterations observed in animals exposed to stress are analogous to changes in a number of physiological and endocrine parameters observed in anxious patients. With the purpose to guide further clinical studies in subtypes of anxious patients, etifoxine, a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic compound, was evaluated in two rat models of anxiety with measures of physiological manifestations: stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) and conditioned-fear-stress-induced freezing behavior and activation of colonic motility. The sequential handling of animals induced a rise in body temperature attenuated by etifoxine (50 mg/kg IP). The emotional stress induced by fear to receive electric foot shocks is accompanied by freezing behavior and an increase of the frequency of ceco-colonic spike bursts: both parameters were reduced by etifoxine (25-50 mg/kg IP), independently of changes in pain perception and memory-related processes. In response to a stressful event, the stimulation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) system is probably involved in the observed modifications of body temperature and colonic motility. It is hypothesized that stress-induced CRH activation is attenuated by the enhancement of the inhibitory GABAergic system activity associated with etifoxine. These findings will guide future evaluation of etifoxine in the treatment of selected anxious patients with altered autonomic symptomatology.", 
    "24": "Proinflammatory cytokines released during the course of infection elicit numerous behavioral and metabolic changes. The decrease in food intake that accompanies infection is mediated in part by interleukin-1 (IL-1). Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neuropeptide released during a meal, decreases food intake, and previous research suggests that CCK mediates the anorectic action of IL-1. The effects of estrogen on food intake are also thought to involve CCK, as the satiety action of CCK is increased by estradiol in both intact and ovariectomized rats. Estradiol also modulates many of the behavioral and physiological effects of IL-1. The present experiment examined the ability of the CCK(A) receptor antagonist devazepide to block the effects of IL-1 and estradiol on food intake in female rats. Adult animals were ovariectomized and given two daily subcutaneous injections of estradiol benzoate (EB; 5.0 microg) or the oil vehicle 3 weeks after surgery. Three days after treatment onset, animals were pretreated with devazepide or its vehicle 30 min prior to intraperitoneal injections of IL-1beta (4.0 microg/kg) or saline given 1 h before light offset. Food and water intake was measured following 2 h of spontaneous feeding. The results indicate that devazepide failed to reverse the anorectic action of IL-1beta, although the effects of estradiol on food intake were blocked by devazepide. These data do not support a role for CCK in IL-1-induced anorexia, and suggest that cytokines may act directly on neural systems involved in the control of food intake.", 
    "25": "GABAergic interneurons are highly diverse and operate with a corresponding diversity of GABA(A) receptor subtypes in controlling behaviour. In this article, we review the significance of GABA(A) receptor heterogeneity for neural circuit development and central nervous system pharmacology. GABA(A) receptor subtypes were identified as selective targets for behavioural actions of benzodiazepines and of selected intravenous anesthetic agents using point mutations which render a specific receptor subtype insensitive to the action of the respective drugs and also by novel subtype-selective ligands. The pharmacological separation of anxiolysis and sedation guides the development of novel anxiolytics, while inverse agonism at extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors involved in learning and memory is currently being evaluated as a novel therapeutic principle for symptomatic memory enhancement.", 
    "26": "The dietary flavonoids apigenin, genistein and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) inhibited the activation by GABA (40 microM) of recombinant human alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with IC(50) values of 8, 30 and 15 microM, respectively. Apigenin and genistein also acted as GABA antagonists at flumazenil-insensitive alpha1beta2 GABA(A) receptors, indicating that they were not acting as negative modulators through flumazenil-sensitive benzodiazepine sites on GABA(A) receptors. In addition to these GABA(A) antagonist effects, a novel second order modulatory action was found for apigenin and EGCG on the first order enhancement of GABA responses by diazepam. Apigenin (1 microM) and EGCG (0.1 microM) enhanced the modulatory action of diazepam (3 microM) on the activation by GABA (5 microM) of recombinant human alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors by up to 22% and 52%, respectively. This was not found with genistein, nor was it observed with enhancement by allopregnanolone or pentobarbitone.", 
    "27": "The benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors is located at the interface of the alpha and gamma subunits. Certain point mutations in these subunits have been demonstrated to dramatically reduce the affinity of benzodiazepine binding site ligands for these receptors. Recently, mice were generated with a phenylalanine (F) to isoleucine (I) substitution at position 77 in the gamma2 subunit of GABA(A) receptors. Here we tested the potency of 24 benzodiazepine binding site ligands from 16 different structural classes for inhibition of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to brain membranes of these gamma2F77I mice. Results indicate that the potency of the classical 1,4-benzodiazepines, of the 1,4-thienodiazepine clotiazepam, the 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam, or the pyrazoloquinoline CGS 9896 is only 2-7-fold reduced by this gamma2F77I point mutation. The potency of the imidazopyrimidines Ru 32698, Ru 33203, and Ru 33356, of the imidazoquinoline Ru 31719, or the pyrazolopyridine CGS 20625 is reduced 10-20-fold, whereas the potency of some imidazobenzodiazepines, beta-carbolines, cyclopyrrolones, imidazopyridines, triazolopyridazines, or quinolines is 100-1000-fold reduced. Interestingly, the extent of potency reduction induced by the gamma2F77I point mutation varied within the structural classes of compounds. Results support and significantly extend previous observations indicating that the residue gamma2F77 is important for high affinity binding of some, but not all benzodiazepine site ligands.", 
    "28": "The GABA(A) receptor system is implicated in a number of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, making GABA(A) receptor ligands interesting as potential therapeutic agents. Only a few different classes of structures are currently known as ligands for the GABA recognition site on the hetero-pentameric GABA(A) receptor complex, reflecting the very strict structural requirements for GABA(A) receptor recognition and activation. A large number of the compounds showing agonist activity at the GABA(A) receptor site are structurally derived from the GABA(A) agonists muscimol, THIP (Gaboxadol), or isoguvacine, which we developed at the initial stage of the project. Using recombinant GABA(A) receptors, functional selectivity has been shown for a number of compounds, including THIP, showing subunit-dependent potency and maximal response. The pharmacological and clinical activities of THIP probably reflect its potent effects at extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors insensitive to benzodiazepines and containing alpha(4)beta(3)delta subunits. The results of ongoing clinical studies on the effect of the partial GABA(A) agonist THIP on human sleep pattern show that the functional consequences of a directly acting agonist are distinctly different from those seen after administration of GABA(A) receptor modulators, such as benzodiazepines. In the light of the interest in partial GABA(A) receptor agonists as potential therapeutics, structure-activity studies of a number of analogues of 4-PIOL, a low-efficacy partial GABA(A) agonist derived from THIP, have been performed. In this connection, a series of GABA(A) ligands has been developed showing pharmacological profiles ranging from low-efficacy partial GABA(A) agonist activity to selective antagonist effect.", 
    "29": "Following the recognition of GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, the discovery of high affinity GABA uptake, and the characterisation of GABA receptors great progress has been made in developing GABA pharmacology. Tiagabide, the first marketed GABA uptake inhibitor may be followed by new and more selective uptake inhibitors. Knowledge of the molecular pharmacology of GABA-A receptors, both synaptic and non-synaptic, may lead to improved anti-anxiety/anticonvulsant agents devoid of the sedative and dependence liabilities of earlier compounds and new hypnotics. Gaboxadol (THIP) is an example of a novel hypnotic that acts on GABA-A receptors by a non-benzodiazepine mechanism. Exploiting neurosteroid interactions with GABAergic mechanisms also holds much future promise.", 
    "30": "Analyzing hair for many substances can be tedious and expensive, and a rapid screening method should prove helpful. Generally, screening has been performed using immunological tests, mainly in workplace drug testing, where the number of samples has been high. The aim of this study was to develop an LC-MS-MS method for the simultaneous analysis of several drugs of abuse in human hair as an alternative to immunological screening tests. In 75 randomly selected autopsy cases, hair was analyzed in addition to the usual specimens of blood and urine. The method included nicotine, cotinine, morphine, codeine, 6-acetylmorphine, ethylmorphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, 7-aminoflunitrazepam and diazepam. The LC-MS-MS analysis was performed on a SCIEX API 2000 MS-MS instrument equipped with an electrospray interface. To 20-50 mg of hair, 0.5 ml of mobile phase A (acetonitril:methanol:20 mM formate buffer, pH 3.0 (10:10:80)) and 25 microl of internal standard were added and the sample was incubated in a water bath at 37 degrees C during 18 h. Using a threshold of 20 ng/sample, equivalent to 1 ng/mg if 20mg hair is used, 26 positive results were found in 16 cases. Three of the 26 positive detections could not be confirmed by GC-MS. Two of the cases were not previously known as drug users. Of the 59 negative cases, only one case had a positive blood sample showing 0.01 and 0.07 microg/g femoral blood of 6-acetylmorphine and morphine, respectively. This might indicate drug abstinence resulting in decreased tolerance or even a \"first time\" use of heroin resulting in death. We conclude that the use of hair analysis in postmortem cases can reveal both unknown drug use, as well as confirm a period of drug abstinence prior to an acute fatal overdose. The proposed LC-MS-MS method showed high sensitivity, was very easy to perform and seemed appropriate for screening purposes.", 
    "31": "The purported lowering of sex opposition, coupled with a possible abrupt unconsciousness-inducing effect and ease of administration in spiked drinks have resulted in the use of hypnotics in cases of drug-facilitated offense. Among these compounds, lorazepam possesses amnesic properties and can impair an individual rapidly. The chances to detect this substance increase if the most sensitive methods are used and if the biological fluid which allows the longest possible detection time is available. In order to document the window of detection of lorazepam, we have orally administered 2.5 mg of the drug to three volunteers and collected oral fluid (n = l) over 8 h, urine (n = 2) over 144 h and hair (n = 3) 4 weeks after exposure. Lorazepam was analyzed by LC-MS/MS after alkalinisation (to pH 8.4 with phosphate buffer) and extraction by dichloromethane/diethyl ether in presence of diazepam-d5, used as internal standard. Reversed-phase separation on a XTerra C18 column was achieved in 12 min, under gradient conditions. Molecular ions (m/z 321 and 290 for lorazepam and the IS, respectively) were selected in Ql and the corresponding daughter ions (m/z 303 and 275 for lorazepam and m/z 154 and 198 for the IS) were detected in Q3 after collision with argon. Urine tested positive for lorazepam over 144 h (2-4 ng/ml), with a peak detected after 24 h exposure (411-880 ng/ml). Oral fluid tested positive for lorazepam over 8 h (0.7 ng/ml). Despite a limit of quantitation at 1 pg/mg, we were unable to detect a single lorazepam dose in hair, contrarily to most other benzodiazepines that are detectable. Therefore, in case of drug-facilitated crimes involving lorazepam, urine appears as the best specimen to document exposure, particularly if LC-MS/MS is used.", 
    "32": "The number of reports on drug facilitated crimes is increasing these last years. Apart from ethanol and cannabis, benzodiazepines (BZD) and analogs are the most common drugs reported to be used probably due to their amnesic and sedative properties. We have developed a rapid and sensitive method using LC-MS/MS triple stage quadrupole (TSQ) for the determination of single exposure to bromazepam (Lexomil, 6 mg) and clonazepam (Rivotril, 2 mg) in urine and hair of healthy volunteers. Chromatography was carried out on a Uptisphere ODB 5 microm, 2.1 mm x 150 mm column (Interchim) with a gradient of acetonitrile and formate 2 mM buffer, pH 3. Urine was extracted with Toxitube A (Varian) and allowed the detection of bromazepam, 3-hydroxy-bromazepam, clonazepam and 7-Aminoclonazepam for more than 6 days. Head hair, collected 1 month after the exposure, was treated by incubation with Soerensen buffer pH 7.6, followed by liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane for common BZD. A specific pre-treatment for amino-BZD, with an incubation of 15 min at 95 degrees C in 0.1 N NaOH before liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane, gave better recoveries and repeatability. After single exposure, bromazepam was present in powdered hair at 28 pg/mg and 7-Aminoclonazepam at 22 pg/mg in the first 1-cm segment, while no clonazepam was detectable. This method was applied in two forensic cases. It allowed us to determine bromazepam in urine 3 days after the alleged offense and in cut head hair at a concentration of 6.7 pg/mg only in the 2-cm proximal segment. The other case showed the presence of clonazepam and 7-Aminoclonazepam in urine a few hours after the offense and the presence of 7-Aminoclonazepam at about 3.2 pg/mg in axillary hair 4 months later.", 
    "33": "Space motion sickness (SMS) is a problem during the first 72 h of space flight and during transitions from different gravity environments. There currently are no effective drug countermeasures for SMS that also accommodate the retention of optimal cognitive function. This creates a dilemma for astronauts because cognitive skills are particularly important during gravity transitions (e.g., take-off and landing). To quantify the cognitive side effects of potential drug countermeasures, an automated delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) procedure was used to assess visual working memory before and after drug countermeasures (meclizine 25 mg, scopolamine 0.4 mg, promethazine 25 mg, or lorazepam 1 mg, given orally approximately 45 min prior to testing) and/or the induction of SMS by vestibular stimulation in a rotary chair (spinning). Sixty-seven normal healthy volunteers (mean age, in years, 26.6+/-4.8 S.D.; 24 females and 43 males) each participated in two test sessions, one 'off' drug and one 'on' drug. Spinning by itself significantly decreased task accuracy (Acc) and choice response speed, especially at longer recall delays. Meclizine alone had no effect on Acc or speed with or without spinning. Scopolamine alone decreased Acc, and with spinning, slowed speed. Promethazine alone had no adverse effect, but combined with spinning, decreased Acc and speed. Lorazepam alone decreased speed, and with spinning, decreased Acc. The data suggest that, at clinically useful doses, the rank order of the drugs with the best cognitive profiles is meclizine>scopolamine>promethazine>lorazepam.", 
    "34": "Stimulation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors delays the development of kindling, a model of epileptogenesis in humans. Blocking alpha(2)-adrenoceptors is proconvulsant, but has beneficial effects on somatomotor recovery after experimental stroke. We investigated whether atipamezole, a selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, affects the recovery process from status epilepticus (SE)-induced brain damage, which affects the risk of epileptogenesis. Vehicle or atipamezole (100 microg/kg/h) treatment was started 1 week after the induction of SE and continued for 9 weeks using Alzet minipumps (n = 70). Development and severity of epilepsy, spatial and emotional learning, and histologic analysis were used as outcome measures. There were no differences in the percentage of animals with epilepsy in the different treatment groups. In the atipamezole group, however, daily seizure frequency was lower (P < 0.01), a higher percentage of epileptic animals had mild epilepsy (<1 seizure/day; P < 0.01), and seizure frequency did not increase over time compared with the vehicle group. The atipamezole group had milder hilar cell damage (P < 0.05) and less intense mossy fiber sprouting (P < 0.05). Behavioral impairments were similar between groups. Our data indicate that chronic treatment with atipamezole does not prevent epileptogenesis. There is, however, a disease-modifying effect; that is, the epilepsy that develops is milder and non-progressive. These data warrant further studies.", 
    "35": "[(123)I]Iomazenil (IMZ) is a specific ligand for central-type benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs) and is available for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to detect epileptogenic foci. We have recently demonstrated time-dependent alterations of [(125)I]IMZ binding in the rat kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Quantitative evaluation of central-type benzodiazepine receptors with [(125)I]Iomazenil in experimental epileptogenesis. I. The rat kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy. In the present study, we investigated regional changes in central-type BZRs in the cortical dysplasia (CD) model of epilepsy in rats. Pregnant rats were irradiated at day 17 of gestation with 1.2 Gy to produce CD in their pups, and in vitro autoradiography with [(125)I]IMZ was performed at 8 weeks after birth. Intact rats at the same age were used as controls. [(125)I]IMZ binding was significantly decreased in various cortical regions of the in utero irradiated rats, including the bilateral frontal cortex (down to 92-93% of control), cingulate cortex (91-92%), hippocampal areas CA1 (95%), CA2 (94-95%) and CA4 (95-96%), and caudate/putamen (90-94%). In addition, amygdala-kindling was significantly facilitated in the CD model, especially during the late phase of kindling, suggesting seizure susceptibility of this model. These results may replicate the clinical usefulness of central-type BZRs neuroimaging for detection of human epileptogenic CD and indicate dysfunction of GABA-A/BZR-mediated inhibition responsible for the seizure susceptibility.", 
    "36": "This study aimed at quantitatively evaluating hippocampal central-type benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs) in the kainate model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) by in vitro autoradiography (ARG) using [(125)I] Iomazenil (IMZ) specific ligand for central-type BZRs. Kainate (1 microg/0.5 microl) was injected into the left amygdala to induce limbic status epilepticus. One, three, or six months after injection, in vitro ARG with [(125)I] IMZ and cell counts were performed in the hippocampal CA1-4 regions and dentate gyrus ipsilateral to the kainate injection site, and were compared with the vehicle-injected control group. In all kainate-treated rats, clear pyramidal neuron loss was observed in left hippocampal areas CA1-4. Compared with the control group, progressive reduction of [(125)I] IMZ binding was also observed. This resulted in a marked binding decrease paralleling pyramidal neuron loss in hippocampal areas CA1 (down to 83% of control), CA2 (76%), CA3 (75%), and CA4 (90%) at 6 months after kainate administration. Conversely, [(125)I] IMZ binding significantly increased in the dentate gyrus (up to 106% of control) at 1 month, but returned to nearly normal at 3-6 months. These results suggest that central-type BZR neuroimaging is useful in detecting hippocampal sclerosis in the mesial TLE, though central BZR alterations differ depending on hippocampal subfields and post-seizure time-courses.", 
    "37": "Previous studies of our group demonstrated that flunitrazepam is a lipophilic drug capable of interacting with membranes through a partition equilibrium phenomenon. Its localization at the phospholipid polar head region could explain the decrease in the size of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dpPC) vesicles, through a mechanism that involves the increment in the relative volume of this region with a subsequent increase in the vesicle's surface curvature. In the present work, we investigated if flunitrazepam can affect the L(alpha)-H(II) phase transition of phosphatidylethanolamine through a similar mechanism. This study was approached by using merocyanine 540, a dye sensitive to the molecular packing of membrane lipids. A detailed analysis of merocyanine absorption and fluorescence emission and excitation spectra was performed. The results indicated that the fluorescence emitted came mainly from the monomeric form of merocyanine and that it resulted a good indicator of this phase transition, as was previously described. Flunitrazepam did not affect significantly the onset of the phase transition but showed a tendency to diminish the dye fluorescence emission intensity, which could involve a lower partition of merocyanine in the vesicles. Moreover, the results suggest that this drug produced a delay in the completeness of the phase transition and a decrement in the cooperativity of this phenomenon.", 
    "38": "Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, are widely used in human medicine as anxiolytics or sedatives, and at higher doses can produce amnesia. Here we demonstrate that in rats lorazepam impairs both recognition memory and synaptic plastic processes (long-term depression and long-term potentiation). Both impairments are produced by actions in perirhinal cortex. The findings thus establish a mechanism by means of which benzodiazepines impair recognition memory. The findings also strengthen the hypotheses that the familiarity discrimination component of recognition memory is dependent on reductions in perirhinal neuronal responses when stimuli are repeated and that these response reductions are due to a plastic mechanism also used in long-term depression.", 
    "39": "High-frequency oscillations (140-200 Hz) were recorded in behaving rats from the CA1 area of the hippocampus. As generation of these synchronous patterns is assumed to depend on coordinated interneuronal inhibition, we studied the interference of benzodiazepines with the fine structure and occurrence of ripple oscillations. The nonselective GABAA receptor alpha-subunit agonist, diazepam, lowered the frequency of ripple oscillations and reduced their occurrence, amplitude and duration. Zolpidem, an alpha1-subunit selective benzodiazepine elevated ripple duration but acted similar to diazepam in other respects. The nonselective alpha-subunit benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, reduced ripple numbers, amplitude and duration. Wavelet based analysis of the dynamics of intraripple frequency revealed a dramatic decay within a ripple. Only diazepam (1 mg/kg) accelerated this intraripple frequency accommodation. The effects were not due to increased behavioural activity and alertness as evident from vigilance state control. The results suggest a differential role of GABAA receptor subtype specific inhibitory mechanisms in the mediation and fine-tuning of the network synchronization during approximately 200 Hz hippocampal oscillations.", 
    "40": "After peribulbar block analgesia (PBA) instituted in the preoperative anesthetic room, patients are often anxious, developing increased heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) upon their arrival to the operating room and during subsequent surgery. The efficacy of premedication in attenuating these stress responses has not been examined. A prospective audit was undertaken to examine the relationship between the premedication schedules most commonly prescribed at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital and increases in HR and BP during surgery in response to the stress of surgery, and the requirements for intravenous (IV) benzodiazepine, opioid or NSAID medication to treat these increases, or any complaint of pain or positional discomfort on the operating table, respectively.", 
    "41": "The preoperative and intraoperative anesthesia course of 1,064 patients > or = 50 years of age who underwent ocular surgery under PBA was prospectively examined. The following data were recorded: (i) patient characteristics, state of health or disease, medications and premedications; (ii) heart rate (HR), systolic arterial pressure (SAP), and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) at 0600 hrs before surgery (baseline), on admission to the operating room, maximum and minimum values of HR, SAP and DAP recorded at the start of, and during, surgery; and (iii) all instances of benzodiazepine, opioid or NSAID drug administration during surgery, according to standard protocols.", 
    "42": "Five premedication schedules were identified: Group 1 hydroxyzine po alone (n = 302); Group 2 hydroxyzine, paracetamol with codeine (Revacod), diclofenac po (N = 173); Group 3 hydroxyzine, diclofenac, ranitidine po (N = 94); Group 4 hydroxyzine, cimetidine or ranitidine po, morphine or pethidine IM (N = 340); and Group 5 lorazepam (nocte), hydroxyzine, diclofenac, ranitidinepo, morphine or meperidine IM (N = 155). The five groups of patients were comparable for age, sex, weight and health. Healthy, diseased (with concurrent hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease) and all patients in each premedication group had similar baseline HR, SAP and DAP. In the operating room, the maximum and minimum mean HR in each group was similar, except that more patients in Group 1 developed SAP exceeding 160 mmHg and DAP exceeding 90 mmHg than in Group 5 (p<0.002 and <0.0005, respectively). The requirements for medication at the commencement of, and during, surgery in the five groups to treat increases in HR/BP, eye pain and positional discomfort on the operating table were similar.", 
    "43": "Each of the five premedication schedules described appear to confer similar effects on cardiovascular changes in anticipation of, and during, surgery, except that those given the lightest premedication, Group 1, showed greater increases in BP at the start of surgery than did those given the heaviest premedication, Group 5. The requirements in the operating room for IV medication were similar in the five premedication groups, and no greater benefit was discernible for any one of the five premedication schedules on the objective features assessed. These data suggest that simple oral premedication of hydroxyzine, with or without an H2 receptor antagonist and NSAID, may suffice as premedication in middle-aged to elderly patients undergoing anterior segment surgery.", 
    "44": "The present study compared recent trends in benzodiazepine and antidepressant consumption in Italy and projected their global sales in the future. We investigated whether the increasing use of antidepressants is associated with a progressive reduction in benzodiazepine use.", 
    "45": "Data concerning actual quantities of benzodiazepines and antidepressants dispensed in Italy from 1995 to June 2003 were obtained from IMS Health. For each agent, the number of defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1000 inhabitants per day and the annual expenditure in Euros was calculated.", 
    "46": "During the 9-year period, benzodiazepine consumption remained substantially stable, accounting for 50 DDDs/1000 per day in 2003. In the same period, antidepressant consumption dramatically rose, from 9 DDDs/1000 per day in 1995 to 26 DDDs/1000 per day in 2003, an increase of nearly three times. While the use of tricyclic antidepressants declined by one-third and that of other older agents remained substantially stable, the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and newer agents (venlafaxine, mirtazapine, reboxetine) increased by 623%. Global consumption of antidepressants was projected to increase still further, and, in 2007, the total sales of antidepressants were projected to be similar to the total sales of benzodiazepines. The value of benzodiazepine sales increased from 322 million to 565 million Euros, an increase of 43%; similarly, the value of antidepressant sales increased from 186 million to 569 million Euros, an increase of 67%.",

    "48": "A substantial number of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia may remain symptomatic after standard treatment (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or irreversible monamine oxidase inhibitors). In this review, recommendations for the treatment of patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia who do not respond to these drugs are provided. Nonresponse to drug treatment could be defined as a failure to achieve a 50% reduction on a standard rating scale after a minimum of 6 weeks of treatment in adequate dose. When initial treatments have failed, the medication should be changed to other standard treatments. In further attempts at treatment, drugs should be used that have shown promising results in preliminary studies, such as venlafaxine. Combination treatments may be used, such as the combination of an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a benzodiazepine. Psychological treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy have to be considered in all patients, regardless whether they are nonresponders or not. According to existing studies, a combination of pharmacologic treatment with cognitive-behavioral therapy can be recommended.", 
    "49": "Clinical and epidemiological data suggest that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic illness causing patients to suffer for many years leading to significant distress in daily life functioning. The literature suggests the several conclusions. GAD is a disorder in need of appropriate treatment and often has a chronic course with comorbid conditions, such as major depression and other anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines, while effective anxiolytic agents acutely, when prescribed for >4 weeks cause rebound anxiety and following prolonged therapy may lead to withdrawal symptoms. Antidepressants cause significant anxiety relief compared with placebo and for psychosocial treatment cognitive-behavioral therapy is an efficacious psychosocial treatment. Many GAD patients are in need of long-term medication management. Furthermore, there is limited data for patients diagnosed with GAD the treatment outcome with the combination of medication and psychotherapy both acutely and long-term; how to best sequence these treatments; for those patients who do not meet remission criteria what is the ideal approach for augmentation; and for patients with treatment-refractory GAD the empirical evidence is lacking on medication switching and augmentation strategies. Research is needed in the area of developing treatment strategies for patients suffering from treatment-refractory GAD. There is still an urgent need to explore treatment combinations and duration strategies in the management of patients suffering with GAD.", 
    "50": "Over the last 25 years, there has been a rapid expansion of our knowledge base of social phobia (SP). Although there are a number of well-validated treatment modalities, including pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, significant gaps remain in our ability to achieve full remission in most patients. Despite advances in the neurobiology of SP, the etiology has yet to be determined. Investigations examining potential predictors of response have provided little guidance in selecting an appropriate treatment modality. These gaps in our knowledge have pushed us to examine issues related to treatment resistance. This paper presents a review of the current literature and issues related to treatment-resistant SP, including a discussion of the functional impairment associated with SP, definitions of treatment response and remission, as well as outcome measures that have been used in clinical investigations of SP. In addition, criteria for a standard treatment trial, predictors of treatment response, a review of treatment resistance studies, and potential directions for future research are examined. The most promising strategies to attain remission, will likely involve augmenting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors with agents such as anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics as well as combining pharmacotherapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy. Our current treatment target of simply attaining a response needs to be refocused, so that an asymptomatic state and high end state functioning become the final goal of treatment.", 
    "51": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, the major inhibitory receptors in the brain, are important targets of many drugs, including general anesthetics. These compounds exert multiple effects on GABAA receptors, including direct activation, prolongation of deactivation kinetics, and reduction of inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitudes. However, the degree to which these actions occur differs for different agents and synapses, possibly because of subunit-specific effects on postsynaptic receptors. In contrast to benzodiazepines and intravenous anesthetics, there is little information available about the subunit dependency of actions of volatile anesthetics. Therefore, the authors studied in detail the effects of isoflurane on recombinant GABAA receptors composed of several different subunit combinations.", 
    "52": "Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transiently transfected with rat complementary DNAs of alpha1beta2, alpha1beta2gamma2L, alpha1beta2gamma2S, alpha5beta3, or alpha5beta3gamma2S subunits. Using rapid application and whole cell patch clamp techniques, cells were exposed to 10- and 2,000-ms pulses of gamma-aminobutyric acid (1 mm) in the presence or absence of isoflurane (0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mm). Anesthetic effects on decay kinetics, peak amplitude, net charge transfer and rise time were measured. Statistical significance was assessed using the Student t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey post hoc test.", 
    "53": "Under control conditions, incorporation of a gamma2 subunit conferred faster deactivation kinetics and reduced desensitization. Isoflurane slowed deactivation, enhanced desensitization, and reduced peak current amplitude in alphabeta receptors. Coexpression with a gamma2 subunit caused these effects of isoflurane to be substantially reduced or abolished. Although the two gamma2 splice variants imparted qualitatively similar macroscopic kinetic properties, there were significant quantitative differences between effects of isoflurane on deactivation and peak current amplitude in gamma2S- versus gamma2L-containing receptors. The net charge transfer resulting from brief pulses of gamma-aminobutyric acid was decreased by isoflurane in alphabeta but increased in alphabetagamma receptors.", 
    "54": "The results indicate that subunit composition does substantially influence modulation of GABAA receptors by isoflurane. Specifically, the presence of a gamma2 subunit and the identity of its splice variant are important factors in determining physiologic and pharmacologic properties. These results may have functional implications in understanding how anesthetic effects on specific types of GABAA receptors in the brain contribute to changes in brain function and behavior.", 
    "55": "The purpose of this study was to clarify the neurophysiologic basis of oromotor deficits in a patient with atypical rolandic epilepsy. We investigated magnetoencephalographic analysis of rolandic discharges with right predominance before and during clonazepam therapy. Before clonazepam administration, current sources of rolandic discharges were broadly distributed in the secondary sensory cortex, superior temporal gyrus, and parietal association area in addition to hand and orofacial division of the primary somatosensory cortex. During clonazepam therapy, oromotor deficits were improved, along with a decrease in rolandic discharge, and current sources of residual right-sided rolandic discharges were shifted to the right superior parietal lobule. Taking the clinical course and magnetoencephalographic findings together, the distributed rolandic discharge focus might be closely related to oromotor deficits, and clonazepam was effective for the disorder.", 
    "56": "The prevalence of gait disorders among neurological inpatients is unknown, although disturbed gait is a common symptom. Gait disorders often lead to loss of independence with restraints for the patients and caregivers and costs for the health system. We designed a prospective study and investigated all patients admitted to a neurological hospital during a 100-day period for the presence of a gait disorder. Clinical investigation and several disease-specific rating scales were carried out for 493 patients. In 60% of the patients, a disturbance of gait was diagnosed. Most frequent diagnoses were stroke (21%), Parkinson's disease (17%), and polyneuropathy (7%). Within these diagnoses, the rate of patients with disturbed gait was high in Parkinson's disease (93%), subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (85%), and motor neuron disease (83%). Advanced age, dementia, alcohol abuse, and treatment with antiepileptics, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, and chemotherapeutics were identified as risk factors for a gait disorder. A decline of cognitive function was accompanied by a reduction of walking speed. According to these results, gait disorders are among the most frequent symptoms in neurology.",

    "58": "Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is a neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorder of unknown cause that shows considerable clinical heterogeneity. In CBD, activated microglia have been shown to be associated closely with the extensive tau pathology found in the affected basal ganglia, brainstem nuclei, and cortical regions. We report on the use of [(11)C](R)-(1-[2-chlorophenyl]-N-methyl-N-[1-methylpropyl]-3-isoquinoline carboxamide) (PK11195) positron emission tomography (PET), a marker of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBS) that are expressed by activated microglia, to demonstrate in vivo the degree and distribution of glial response to the degenerative process in 4 patients with CBD. Compared with normal age-matched controls, the CBD patient group showed significantly increased mean [(11)C](R)-PK11195 binding in the caudate nucleus, putamen, substantia nigra, pons, pre- and postcentral gyrus, and the frontal lobe. [11C](R)-PK11195 PET reveals a pattern of increased microglial activation in CBD patients involving cortical regions and the basal ganglia that corresponds well with the known distribution of neuropathological changes, which may therefore help to characterize in vivo the underlying disease activity in CBD.", 
    "59": "The present pharmacological study was conducted to investigate a possible role of the brain histaminergic system in vocalization induced in guinea pig pups by maternal separation and isolation in an unfamiliar environment. The effects of drugs acting at histamine receptors were determined after intraperitoneal injection, comprising hydroxyzine and chlorpheniramine, both histamine H1 antagonists, and the H3 agonist, immepip. A range of psychoactive drugs known to be active in this paradigm was also tested for comparison. Hydroxyzine, 4.3 to 14.3 mg/kg, dose-dependently suppressed vocalization but neither chlorpheniramine, 2 to 16 mg/kg, nor immepip, 5 to 20 mg/kg, was active. All reference drugs, fluoxetine, 5 and 10 mg/kg, imipramine, 16 and 32 mg/kg, and chlordiazepoxide, 5 and 10 mg/kg, were shown to be active. The present data indicate that, consistent with known anxiolytic effects in man, the antihistamine hydroxyzine proved effective in suppressing maternal-separation-induced vocalization in guinea pig pups. However, in view of the lack of effect of either chlorpheniramine or immepip, it is proposed that additional nonhistaminergic effects are involved in the tranquilizing action of hydroxyzine.", 
    "60": "This study examined the effects of low, therapeutic doses of diazepam on several measures of impulsive behavior in healthy volunteers. Volunteers (N=35) participated in a three-session double-blind randomized design in which they received diazepam (5 or 10 mg) or placebo. The volunteers were classified as high and low impulsive based on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11). One hour after ingesting the capsule on each session, participants completed mood questionnaires and five impulsivity tasks: go/no-go task, delay discounting task, time estimation task, stop task, and the balloon analogue risk task (BART). Diazepam (5 and 10 mg) produced its prototypic sedative-like mood effects. However, the drug did not affect performance on any of the measures of impulsive behavior in either the high or low BIS participants. These results suggest that low doses of diazepam, including doses that are used therapeutically, do not increase impulsive behavior. Whether higher doses would increase impulsivity remains to be determined.", 
    "61": "The plant Butea frondosa has been indicated in the Indian system of medicine as a plant augmenting memory and as a rejuvenator. The effect of oral administration of the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of the leaves was assessed on stress, cognitive function, and anxiety in albino rats. The antistress activity was evaluated using cold restraint induced ulcers and leukocyte count after subcutaneous injection of milk. The aqueous extract provides protection against stress-induced gastric lesions while both the alcoholic as well as the aqueous extract normalizes the white blood cell count. Effect on cognitive function was evaluated using Cook and Weidley's pole apparatus. The results indicate that the aqueous extract and the alcoholic extract when administered at a dose of 300 mg/kg for a period of 7 days augment both the acquisition as well as the retention of memory of learned task. The absence of an increase in the occupancy of the open arm in the elevated plus maze and in the number of head dips in the hole-board paradigms indicates that both the extracts are devoid of anxiolytic activity. Nootropic activity was compared using piracetam (100 mg/kg po) as the standard, while for anxiolytic and antistress activity, diazepam (1.0 mg/kg ip) was employed as the standard drug. It is concluded that the aqueous and alcoholic extract of B. frondosa possesses antistress and weak nootropic activity.", 
    "62": "Clozapine (Clozaril) and olanzapine (Zyprexa) are two relatively new atypical antipsychotics that are structurally and pharmacologically related. There are currently no therapeutic indications for these pharmaceuticals in infants and toddlers.Presumably, as the usage of these medications in adults increases, the frequency of unintentional pediatric ingestions will increase. In 2001 the annual report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers Toxic Exposure Surveillance System included a separate subcategory for atypical antipsychotics under the heading of sedatives/hypnotics/antipsychotics. The toxidrome resulting from these drugs is predominately central nervous system depression and anticholinergic effects. Although the desirable lack of extrapyramidal symptoms in adults results in their greatest clinical utility, several reports of toxic ingestions in small children are noteworthy for having extrapyramidal manifestations. We review here the available reported clinical experience with toxic doses of these medications that in small children may amount to as little as a single tablet. Although such doses may be lethal, supportive care and gastrointestinal decontamination in this population will generally lead to a good outcome.",

A 46-year-old woman was brought to the Emergency Department after being found confused and nonverbal while wandering in a field. Eighteen tablets (72 mg) of her tiagabine prescription were missing. Remarkable findings on initial examination were facial grimacing, flexure posturing of both upper extremities, and 7-mm, reactive pupils. She was uncommunicative and unable to follow commands. Vital signs, blood chemistries and a head CT scan were normal. Urine toxicology screening was negative. An extrapyramidal reaction was suspected and diphenhydramine 50 mg was administered without effect. Lorazepam 2 mg was given with significant improvement. She was admitted for observation and all symptoms resolved within 12 h of admission. Tiagabine overdose causes an unusual array of neurological symptoms, many similar to reported adverse effects during therapeutic use.",

The patient was successfully treated for Tetanus with complete recovery. Tetanus is caused by the organism Clostridium Tetani, which usually requires an open lesion to cause infection. Our patient was unique in that he was previously immunized with no obvious lesion. Tetanus should be suspected and treated empirically in any patient presenting with typical signs and symptoms even without an apparent entry site.",

Significantly greater reductions were experienced by young women, and persons living in zip codes that were urban, predominantly Black, or with a high density of poor households. Increases in potential substitute medications were modest. At baseline, nearly 60% of BZ recipients had no evidence of potentially problematic use. Despite a somewhat greater likelihood of discontinuation of BZ therapy among those with potentially problematic use, the largest impact of the TPP was a substantially greater relative reduction in access to BZs among non-problematic users.",

Prompt anticonvulsive intervention is usually also required to terminate the ensuing seizure activity and to prevent delayed permanent brain damage. Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine agonist, has the advantage of rapid absorption following intramuscular administration. In mass casualty situations, the availability of an autoinjector, filled with midazolam, might be a further advantage. In the present study, the plasma pharmacokinetics of midazolam after administration by an autoinjector was compared with conventional intramuscular (i.m.) administration in two groups of four pigs each. During the first 15 min after injection, significantly higher plasma concentrations of midazolam were detected following autoinjector administration, compared with the i.m. injection. The physiological reflection of the accelerated midazolam absorption was a marked reduction in the time interval required for muscle relaxation, induced by midazolam. It is concluded that a midazolam autoinjector might be helpful in the mass casualty scenario following organophosphate poisoning.",

His cigarette consumption increased rapidly from 12 to 80 cigarettes per day following his discharge. Ten days later, his delusion of persecution, levels of hostility, and aggressive behavior worsened, while the plasma levels of olanzapine concurrently decreased. Based on our observations of this case, we suggest that the reduced levels of plasma olanzapine and exacerbated clinical symptoms are closely related to the increased consumption of cigarettes. A possible explanation would be that heavy smoking induced cytochrome P4501A2, the major enzyme involved in olanzapine metabolism. Therefore, patients who smoke should be closely monitored for their cigarette consumption when the dosage of olanzapine is adjusted.",

Nine subjects were smokers (>10 cigarettes/d), and 11 subjects were nonsmokers. The subjects received a single oral 20-mg dose of quazepam, and blood samplings and evaluation of psychomotor function were conducted up to 72 hours after dosing. Plasma concentrations of quazepam and its active metabolite 2-oxoquazepam (OQ) were measured by HPLC. There were significant differences between EMs and PMs in the peak plasma concentration (mean +/- SD: 34.5 +/- 16.6 versus 66.2 +/- 19.2 ng/mL, P < 0.01) and total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (490.1 +/- 277.5 vs 812.1 +/- 267.2 ng x h/mL, P < 0.05) of quazepam. The pharmacokinetic parameters of OQ and pharmacodynamic parameters were not different between the 2 groups.

    "96": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of antifactor D monoclonal antibody (Mab) 166-32 on platelet activation during and after hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in baboons. Fourteen baboons (mean weight, 15 kg) underwent hypothermic CPB. Seven of them were treated with a single injection of antifactor D Mab 166-32 (5 mg/kg) and the other seven animals were given saline as control. Each baboon was sedated with an intramuscular injection of 10 mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride. A 20-gauge angiocatheter was placed in the cephalic vein, and 5 mg of diazepam was administered intravenously. Anesthesia was maintained with 0.80% to 2.25% isoflurane, 100% O2, and an inspiratory tidal volume of 13 mL/kg at a rate of 13 breaths per minute throughout the surgical procedure except during CPB. Pancuronium bromide, 0.1 mg/kg, was administered to achieve adequate muscle paralysis. Blood samples were collected before CPB, during CPB, and 1, 2, 3, and 6 h after CPB. Assays were performed to measure platelet activation [CD62P (P-selectin)] using immunofluorocytometric methods. There were no significant differences on CD62P expression of platelets between control and antibody groups before CPB (105 +/- 12% vs. 99 +/- 8%, P=NS), during normothermic CPB (62 +/- 6% vs. 63 +/- 19%, P=NS), during hypothermic CPB (55 +/- 8% vs. 54 +/- 13%, P=NS), and 1, 3, or 6 h after CPB (74 +/- 20% vs. 81 +/- 11%, P=NS). Anesthetic induction with ketamine caused significant reduction in the platelet activation in both groups. Ketamine did not affect complement, neutrophil, and monocyte activation or cytokine production. Further studies on the mechanisms of platelet inhibition by ketamine are warranted.", 
    "97": "Selection of appropriate treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is influenced by several considerations, including psychiatric comorbidity. Emerging data suggest that GAD has a chronic course and a high comorbidity with depression. Successful treatment can be facilitated by first establishing treatment goals, which include managing acute anxiety and following through to remission. Prevention of GAD recurrence should be the ultimate objective. Many treatments exist to aid in the realization of treatment goals, including benzodiazepines, hydroxyzine, buspirone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Some SSRIs and an SNRI have been demonstrated effective in both acute and long-term trials, establishing them as first-line therapies. Benzodiazepines are helpful because of their rapid onset of action and efficacy in somatic and autonomic symptoms of GAD. Other medications in the pipeline include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators, which may have lower abuse potential than currently available agents that act at the GABA receptor; corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) antagonists; and pregabalin. The recent realization of the chronic nature of GAD and the recognition of its frequent comorbidity with depression, coupled with data from randomized clinical trials of newer generation agents, should help physicians better diagnose GAD and achieve the goal of bringing patients to full remission.",

However, there is limited literature available on recovery from intravenous dental sedation, particularly in the private general practice setting. The aim of this study was to describe the recovery times when sedation was conducted in private dental practice and to consider this in relation to age, weight, procedure type, and procedure time. The data were extracted from the intravenous sedation records available with 1 general anesthesia-trained dental practitioner who provides ambulatory sedation services to a number of private general dental practices in the Perth, Western Australia Metropolitan Area. Standardized intravenous sedation techniques as well as clear standardized discharge criteria were utilized. The sedatives used were fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol. Results from 85 patients produced an average recovery time of 19 minutes. Recovery time was not associated with the type or length of dental procedures performed.", 
    "104": "Ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) utilizes sub-2 microm particles with high linear solvent velocities to effect dramatic increases in resolution, sensitivity and speed of analysis. The reduction in particle size to below 2 microm requires instrumentation that can operate at pressures in the 6000-15,000 psi range. The typical peak widths generated by the UPLC system are in the order of 1-2 s for a 10-min separation. In the present work this technology has been applied to the study of in vivo drug metabolism, in particular the analysis of drug metabolites in bile. The reduction in peak width significantly increases analytical sensitivity by three- to five-fold, and the reduction in peak width, and concomitant increase in peak capacity, significantly reduces spectral overlap resulting in superior spectral quality in both MS and MS/MS modes. The application of UPLC/MS resulted in the detection of additional drug metabolites, superior separation and improved spectral quality.", 
    "105": "CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 exhibit significant overlap in substrate specificity but can differ in product regioselectivity and formation activity. To further explore this issue, we compared the kinetics of product formation for eight different substrates, using heterologously expressed CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and phenotyped human liver microsomes. Both enzymes displayed allosteric behavior toward six of the substrates. When it occurred, the \"maximal\" intrinsic clearance was used for quantitative comparisons. Based on this parameter, CYP3A5 was more active than CYP3A4 in catalyzing total midazolam hydroxylation (3-fold) and lidocaine demethylation (1.4-fold). CYP3A5 exhibited comparable metabolic activity as CYP3A4 (90-110%) toward dextromethorphan N-demethylation and carbamazepine epoxidation. CYP3A5-catalyzed erythromycin N-demethylation, total flunitrazepam hydroxylation, testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation, and terfenadine alcohol formation occurred with an intrinsic clearance that was less than 65% that of CYP3A4. Using two sets of human liver microsomes with equivalent CYP3A4-specific content but markedly different CYP3A5 content (group 1, predominantly CYP3A4; group 2, CYP3A4 + CYP3A5), we assessed the contribution of CYP3A5 to product formation rates determined at low substrate concentrations (< or = Km). Mean product formation rates for group 2 microsomes were 1.4- to 2.2-fold higher than those of group 1 (p < 0.05 for 5 of 8 substrates). After adjusting for CYP3A4 activity (itraconazole hydroxylation), mean product formation rates for group 2 microsomes were still significantly higher than those of group 1 (p < 0.05 for 3 substrates). We suggest that, under conditions when CYP3A5 content represents a significant fraction of the total hepatic CYP3A pool, the contribution of CYP3A5 to the clearance of some drugs may be an important source of interindividual variability.",

Several TIBO derivatives have shown high potency to inhibit reverse transcriptase (RT) and one (Tivirapine) has entered into clinical trials. The free energy of binding (FEB) is a numerical way to express the binding affinity of a ligand to its receptor and has been applied in screening candidates in rational drug design. In this work, the FEB of 42 TIBOs in RT was studied. Relative FEB is expressed in the form of a linear combination of vdW, electrostatic, solvation, and nonpolar solvation energy terms. The predicted FEB activity of the TIBOs studied has a good correlation (r(2) = 0.8680, q(2) = 0.8298) with respect to the experimental activity (pIC(50)). Based on the data reported here, the Finite Difference Poisson Boltzmann with a Gaussian Smooth Dielectric Constant Function method (PB/GS) solvation energy term is very important in predicting the binding affinity of TIBOs in RT. In summary, the Dock-Molecular Mechanics (MM)-PB/GS method is a promising technique in predicting ligand/receptor binding affinity and it can be used to screen relatively large sets of molecules in a reasonable amount of computer time.",

We found a mean reduction in ASI scores of 9.6 points, which correlated with symptomatic improvement, and did not differ significantly between groups. Our data provides further evidence that pharmacotherapy leads to significant acute reductions in fears of anxiety symptoms in patients with panic disorder, albeit at levels that may be somewhat less than the changes associated with CBT. Implications of these findings are discussed relative to optimizing pharmacologic treatment of panic disorder.",

Patients dependent only on opiates (n = 39), and patients dependent on both opiates and benzodiazepines (n = 22), were recruited from consecutive admissions to an in-patient drug treatment unit. Quantity and duration of prior opiate use was similar for both groups. Patients completed daily self-ratings of opiate withdrawal (SOWS) for the duration of a standard in-patient detoxification treatment. Co-dependent patients were detoxified from benzodiazepines and opiates concurrently. Co-dependent patients reported a more severe withdrawal symptoms than patients withdrawing from opiates alone. Co-dependent patients had significantly more severe opiate withdrawal symptoms. Concurrent benzodiazepine withdrawal exacerbates opiate specific withdrawal symptoms.

    "124": "The variability of quantal size depends on both presynaptic (profile of the neurotransmitter concentration in the cleft) and postsynaptic (number and gating properties of postsynaptic receptors) factors. Here we have examined the possibility that at nonsaturated synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons, changes in both the transmitter concentration peak and its clearance from the synaptic cleft may influence the variability of spontaneous miniature synaptic GABAergic currents (mIPSCs). We found that, in contrast to the slow-off GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline, fast-off competitive antagonists such as SR-95103 and TPMPA differentially blocked small and large mIPSCs. In the presence of flurazepam, a drug believed to increase the affinity of GABA for GABAAR, small mIPSCs were enhanced more efficiently than large events. Moreover, the addition of dextran, which increases the viscosity of the extracellular fluid, preferentially increased small mIPSCs with respect to large ones. These observations suggest that changes in the concentration peak and the speed of GABA clearance in the cleft may be an important source of synaptic variability. The study of the correlation between peak amplitude and kinetics of mIPSCs allowed determination of the relative contribution of transmitter peak concentration vs. time of GABA clearance. Small synaptic responses were associated with fast onset and decay kinetics while large amplitude currents were associated with slow kinetics, indicating a crucial role for GABA synaptic clearance in variability of mIPSCs. By using model simulations we were able to estimate the range of variability of both the concentration and the speed of clearance of the GABA transient in the synaptic cleft.", 
    "125": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR), first described more than 20 years ago, have been attributed with many putative functions including ones in cellular proliferation and cellular respiration. Hence, it is quite conceivable that deregulation of this receptor could lead to pathology. We and others have reported the existence of PBR overexpression in different human and nonhuman malignancies, but it has never been made clear whether this aberrant malignant PBR expression is a cause or consequence of the cancer. In the current study we induced PBR underexpression by downregulating one critical subunit of the PBR complex, the isoquinoline-binding protein (IBP), using the stable antisense knockout approach, in the MA-10 Leydig cell line. Resultant clones, showing PBR deregulation, also demonstrated increased tumorigenicity, using both in vitro (loss of contact inhibition and growth in soft agar) and in vivo (increased mortality on grafting back into isogenic mice) assays. We suggest that this type of deregulation could be a later event in natural tumor progression. Consequently, PBR deregulation should be more closely studied in human malignancy.", 
    "126": "Tinnitus affects nearly 50 million people in the United States, with a minority demonstrating marked functional impairment. Alterations of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) neuronal function and benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) function in particular have been implicated in the pathophysiology of severe, chronic tinnitus. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the distribution of BZR in the brain using 123I-iomazenil single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging in patients with severe, intractable central tinnitus. Six patients with severe intractable tinnitus received a bolus and constant infusion of 123I-iomazenil intravenously over 7 hours with SPECT and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. After magnetic resonance imaging coregistration, standardized regions of interest were placed over the cerebellar, frontal (control), superior temporal, hippocampal, and thalamic regions bilaterally on (SPECT) images. Venous blood samples were drawn at specified intervals to determine equilibrium distribution volumes (V3') for each of the regions. Variation in V3' values in homotypic regions were calculated using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Twelve normal control subjects were compared to the study subjects using statistical parametric mapping. Comparison of homotypic brain regions showed statistically significant asymmetry in the V3' data in the superior temporal cortex (p = .03 for both). No statistically significant difference was noted in any of the other regions studied. Comparison of the group of study subjects to healthy controls revealed an insignificant trend toward reduction in BZR density in the frontal lobes bilaterally (p = .000) and a reduction in the cerebellum (p = .045). Current understanding suggests GABA receptors and the temporal lobe system as the final common pathway. This pilot study suggests possible alterations on 123I-iomazenil SPECT imaging and the need for larger studies.", 
    "127": "L-Theanine (delta-glutamylethylamide) is one of the predominant amino acids ordinarily found in green tea, and historically has been used as a relaxing agent. The current study examined the acute effects of L-theanine in comparison with a standard benzodiazepine anxiolytic, alprazolam and placebo on behavioural measures of anxiety in healthy human subjects using the model of anticipatory anxiety (AA). Sixteen healthy volunteers received alprazolam (1 mg), L-theanine (200 mg) or placebo in a double-blind placebo-controlled repeated measures design. The acute effects of alprazolam and L-theanine were assessed under a relaxed and experimentally induced anxiety condition. Subjective self-reports of anxiety including BAI, VAMS, STAI state anxiety, were obtained during both task conditions at pre- and post-drug administrations. The results showed some evidence for relaxing effects of L-theanine during the baseline condition on the tranquil-troubled subscale of the VAMS. Alprazolam did not exert any anxiolytic effects in comparison with the placebo on any of the measures during the relaxed state. Neither L-theanine nor alprazalam had any significant anxiolytic effects during the experimentally induced anxiety state. The findings suggest that while L-theanine may have some relaxing effects under resting conditions, neither L-theanine not alprazolam demonstrate any acute anxiolytic effects under conditions of increased anxiety in the AA model.",

The most common misdiagnoses are unipolar depression, schizophrenia and ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). The suicide rate associated with bipolar disease is very high. Treatment consists in the administration of mood stabilizers, in the first instance lithium, but also atypical neuroleptics or lamotrigine. In the depressive phase, additional antidepressants or lamotrigine, in the manic phase valproate or an antipsychotic agent may be needed. Medication must be continued unchanged for several months beyond acute treatment. The subsequent relapse prophylaxis depends on effectiveness, tolerability, comorbidity, suicidal risk and compliance.

    "135": "SJG-136 (NSC 694501) is a novel DNA cross-linking agent that binds in a sequence-selective manner in the minor groove of the DNA helix. It is structurally novel compared with other clinically used DNA cross-linking agents and has exhibited a unique multilog differential pattern of activity in the NCI 60-cell line screen (i.e., is COMPARE negative to other cross-linking agents). Given this profile, we undertook a preclinical evaluation of SJG-136 in primary tumor cells derived from 34 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients. SJG-136 induced apoptosis in all of the B-CLL samples tested with a mean LD50 value (the concentration of drug required to kill 50% of the cells) of 9.06 nmol/L. Its cytotoxicity was undiminished in B-CLL cells derived from patients treated previously, those with unmutated VH genes, and those with p53 mutations (P=0.17; P=0.63; P=0.42, respectively). SJG-136-induced apoptosis was associated with the activation of caspase-3 that could be partially abrogated by the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK. Furthermore, SJG-136 did not trigger the phosphorylation of p53 or the up-regulation of GADD45 expression in B-CLL cells whereas the cross-linking agent chlorambucil elicited both of these effects. This suggests that SJG-136 cross-linking adducts are not subject to p53-mediated DNA excision repair mechanisms in B-CLL cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism of action for SJG-136 that appears to circumvent the effects of poor prognostic markers. This unique cytotoxicity profile warrants further investigation and supports the evaluation of this agent in Phase I clinical trials for patients with B-CLL.",

In the current investigation, SJG-136 was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in 10 tumor models selected on the basis of sensitivity of cells grown in the hollow fiber and in vitro time course assays: LOX IMVI and UACC-62 (melanomas); OVCAR-3 and OVCAR-5 (ovarian carcinomas); MDA-MB-435 (breast carcinoma); SF-295 and C-6 (gliomas); LS-174T (colon carcinoma); HL-60 TB (promyelocytic leukemia); and NCI-H522 (lung carcinoma). SJG-136 was active against small (150 mg) and large (250-400 mg) xenografts with tumor mass reductions in all 10 models. In addition, significant growth delays occurred in nine models, cell kill in six models ranged between 1.9 and 7.2 logs, and there were 1 to 4/6 tumor-free responses in six models. SJG-136 is active following i.v. bolus injections, as well as by 5-day continuous infusions. Of all of the schedules tested, bolus administrations for 5 consecutive days (qd x 5) conferred the greatest efficacy. SJG-136 is active over a wide dosage range in athymic mouse xenografts: on a qd x 5 schedule, the maximum-tolerated dose was approximately 120 microg/kg/dose (total dose: 0.6 mg/kg = 1.8 mg/m2) and the minimum effective dose in the most sensitive model (SF-295) was approximately 16 microg/kg/dose (total dose: 0.08 mg/kg = 0.24 mg/m2).

COMPARE and molecular target analysis of SJG-136 data versus that of >60,000 compounds tested in the NCI 60 cell line screen shows that, although the agent has similarity to other DNA binding agents, the pattern of activity for SJG-136 does not fit within the clusters of any known agents, suggesting that SJG-136 possesses a distinct mechanism of action. Testing in the NCI standard hollow fiber assay produced prominent growth inhibition in 20 of 24 i.p. and 7 of 24 s.c. test combinations with 5 of 12 cell lines exhibiting cell kill. In addition, SJG-136 produced antitumor activity in mice bearing CH1 and CH1cisR xenografts, a cisplatin-resistant human ovarian tumor model, and also in mice bearing LS174T xenografts, a human colon tumor model. SJG-136 produces DNA interstrand cross-links between two N-2 guanine positions on opposite strands and separated by 2 bp. In human tumor cell lines, the cross-links form rapidly and persist compared with those produced by conventional cross-linking agents such as nitrogen mustards. In mice bearing the LS174T human colon xenograft, DNA interstrand cross-links can be detected in tumor cells using a modification of the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay after administration of a therapeutic dose. Cross-links in the tumor increase with dose and are clearly detectable at 1 hour after i.v. administration. The level of cross-linking persists over a 24-hour period in this tumor in contrast to cross-links produced by conventional cross-linking agents observed over the same time period.", 
    "138": "Augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia with the NMDA receptor co-agonist glycine has demonstrated significant improvement in patient symptoms. Interestingly, the therapeutic efficacy of glycine was more consistent among patients that were not co-administered clozapine suggesting that clozapine modulates glycine levels in brain. Since cerebral glycine concentration in the vicinity of NMDA receptors is thought to be controlled by the glia expressed glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1), the effects of several typical and atypical antipsychotics on glycine uptake were examined in human placenta choriocarcinoma (JAR) cells expressing human GlyT1a. The selectivity of these compounds was investigated by measuring their inhibitory potency at the closely related glycine transporter type 2 (GlyT2). Typical antipsychotics haloperidol, thioridazine and chlorpromazine non-selectively inhibited [(14)C]glycine uptake mediated by GlyT1a and GlyT2 with potency of 9-21 microM. The atypical antipsychotic, clozapine antagonized glycine transport by human GlyT1a with an IC(50) of 100 microM and was weaker at recombinant GlyT2. Its main metabolites, N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine N-oxide were very weak inhibitors at all glycine transporters. Similarly, olanzapine did not potently block GlyT1a- and GlyT2-mediated uptake. Detailed kinetic analysis of hGlyT1a in the presence and absence of haloperidol and clozapine revealed that both drugs were not competitive inhibitors of glycine uptake. Data also indicated that these compounds did not interact with the Na(+) and Cl(-) sites of hGlyT1a. Our results have revealed the existence of an inhibitory interaction between some antipsychotics and hGlyT1a and raise the possibility that these drugs could interact with GlyT1 function at therapeutic doses.", 
    "139": "Few treatment studies of schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) have investigated the new, atypical antipsychotic drugs. This study examined the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, in a series of patients with DSM-IV diagnosed schizotypal personality disorder.", 
    "140": "This was a 26-week, open-label study with flexible dose design in 11 subjects with a diagnosis of schizotypal personality disorder based on Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and Personality Disorder Examination (PDE Journal of Psychiatric Disorders 1 (1987) 1). Subjects were treated with a low dose (average 9.32 mg/day) of olanzapine. Psychopathology was assessed at baseline and at the end of the study and analyzed with last observation carried forward analysis.",

    "143": "St John's Wort (SJW) enhances CYP3A4 activity and decreases blood concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates. In this study, the effects of SJW on a benzodiazepine hypnotic, quazepam, which is metabolized by CYP3A4, were examined.", 
    "144": "Thirteen healthy subjects took a single dose of quazepam 15 mg after treatment with SJW (900 mg day(-1)) or placebo for 14 days. The study was performed in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design with an interval of 4 weeks between the two treatments. Blood samples were obtained during a 48 h period and urine was collected for 24 h after each dose of quazepam. Pharmacodynamic effects were determined using visual analogue scales (VAS) and the digit symbol substitution test (DSST) on days 13 and 14.", 
    "145": "SJW decreased the plasma quazepam concentration. The Cmax and AUC(0-48) of quazepam after SJW were significantly lower than those after placebo [Cmax; -8.7 ng ml(-1) (95% confidence interval (CI) -17.1 to -0.2), AUC0-48; -55 ng h ml(-1) (95% CI -96 to -15)]. The urinary ratio of 6beta-hydroxycortisol to cortisol, which reflects CYP3A4 activity, also increased after dosing with SJW (ratio; 2.1 (95%CI 0.85-3.4)). Quazepam, but not SJW, produced sedative-like effects in the VAS test (drowsiness; P < 0.01, mental slowness; P < 0.01, calmness; P < 0.05, discontentment; P < 0.01). On the other hand, SJW, but not quazepam impaired psychomotor performance in the DSST test. SJW did not influence the pharmacodynamic profile of quazepam.", 
    "146": "These results suggest that SJW decreases plasma quazepam concentrations, probably by enhancing CYP3A4 activity, but does not influence the pharmacodynamic effects of the drug.",

    "149": "Visual loss has been associated with quinine serum concentrations above 10 microg/mL (therapeutic range 2-5 microg/mL). Other adverse reactions include neurological symptoms, haemolysis, acute renal failure and arrhythmia. There is conflicting evidence for the efficacy of quinine for leg cramps in randomised controlled studies, however, meta-analysis of these studies suggests some benefit. Although severe side effects are rare at therapeutic doses, the possibility of overdose needs to be considered when prescribing and an individual risk benefit analysis needs to be made. Benefits and adverse reactions should be closely monitored and medication ceased if appropriate.",

Main outcome measures were adjusted and unadjusted incidence rates of diabetes (new cases per 1000 per year) in a 12-month period, as measured using new prescriptions for antidiabetic drugs after a 6-month lead-in period.", 
    "152": "Annual unadjusted incidence rates of diabetes (new cases per 1000 per year) were 7.5 for atypical antipsychotics, 11.3 for traditional antipsychotics, 7.8 for antidepressants and 5.1 for antibiotics. In multivariable analyses, age, male sex and Chronic Disease Score were associated with greater odds of diabetes onset. There were no statistically significant differences in outcome between the atypical antipsychotic, traditional antipsychotic and antidepressant groups. Multivariable comparisons among specific agents showed increased odds of diabetes for clozapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone and thioridazine (relative to risperidone), but these comparisons did not reach statistical significance.",

    "154": "All 481 prescriptions of benzodiazepines from five Zurich pharmacies during a 6 week period were evaluated with respect to their compliance with the Swiss Law on Narcotics, which was formulated to prevent benzodiazepine dependence. Three weeks into the study, all 17 physicians with prescriptions of benzodiazepines practising in the catchment areas of two of the five pharmacies randomly selected were faxed an information sheet explaining formal juridical requirements for benzodiazepine prescription stipulated by the law. 28 % of all prescriptions were not compliant with the law. The older a patient, the greater his/her risk of receiving a non-compliant prescription. Neither sex of patients nor professional specialization of the prescribing doctor did impact prescription compliance. The preventive intervention, i. e. information on legal requirements, also had no significant impact on the compliance of prescriptions with the law. As other studies with soft interventions and educational measures directed to the prescribing physician also failed to reduce inappropriate prescription of benzodiazepines, it is concluded that sanctions against incompliant prescription behaviour should be considered as a preventive alternative.", 
    "155": "Zolpidem is a widely used hypnotic that binds preferentially to alpha1GABAA receptors. We determined the role of these receptors in the effects of zolpidem on sleep in mutant mice carrying zolpidem-insensitive alpha1GABAA receptors and wild-type controls. Sleep was promoted by zolpidem in both genotypes. In wild-type mice non-REM sleep EEG power was markedly reduced in a broad frequency band >5 or 9 Hz after 5 and 10 mg/kg zolpidem, respectively. In mutants a power reduction appeared at the highest dose only, and was restricted to some low frequencies and the 9-10 Hz bin. We conclude that the effects of zolpidem on the sleep EEG in mice are distinct from the changes typically induced by benzodiazepines, and are primarily mediated by alpha1GABAA receptors.", 
    "156": "A quarter of the elderly population is prescribed benzodiazepines (BZD). This has led to growing concerns about drug dependence and the validity of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria for dependence to a substance. This study aimed to understand how dependence was experienced by long-term BZD users. Interviews were conducted with 45 elderly persons who had been using BZDs for an average of nine years. These users' comments suggest six indicators of dependence: self-identifying as a dependent user, invoking multiple stressors to justify BZD use, using BZD to cope with anticipated stressors, trivializing the dangers of BZDs, keeping a supply in reserve, having previously tried and failed to stop, and reducing the dosage. Our results stress the need to take a more elaborate, person-centered view of dependence.", 
    "157": "1. Triazolam (TRZ) has been used extensively in rat to evaluate its benzodiazepine agonist central nervous system effects. However, the pharmacokinetics of TRZ in the male rat are not well understood. 2. To characterize further TRZ biotransformation across species, the NADPH-dependent biotransformation of TRZ was examined in rat and human liver microsomes. The role of specific cytochrome P450s (CYPs) in the biotransformation of TRZ in the rat were also determined using both rat cDNA-expressed CYPs and chemical and antibody inhibition techniques. 3. The formation of TRZ's primary hydroxylated products, alpha-OH- and 4-OH-TRZ, was consistent with a single-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model in humans. 4. Although 4-OH-TRZ formation in the male rat liver was also approximated by a single-enzyme model, a second low-affinity component was identified as contributing to alpha-OH-TRZ formation in the rat. 5. The K(m) values for the primary metabolic pathway differed between the two species. However, the net intrinsic clearances were similar for the rat and human. 6. As observed previously for humans, chemical and antibody inhibition studies suggested that CYP3A enzymes contribute significantly to TRZ hydroxylation in the rat. This finding was further supported by the use of rat cDNA-expressed CYPs. 7. The male rat might serve as a useful model for evaluating mechanisms regulating TRZ metabolism in vivo.", 
    "158": "1. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A catalysis of testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation in female rat liver microsomes was significantly induced, then reached a plateau level after pretreatment with 80 mg kg(-1) day(-1) dexamethasone (DEX) for 3 days. 2. Midazolam was mainly metabolized by CYP3A in DEX-treated female rat liver microsomes from an immuno-inhibition study, and the apparent K(m) was 1.8 microM, similar to that in human microsomes. 3. Ketoconazole and erythromycin, typical CYP3A inhibitors, demonstrated extensive inhibition of midazolam metabolism in DEX-treated female rat liver microsomes, and the apparent K(i) values were 0.088 and 91.2 microM, respectively. The values were similar to those in humans, suggesting that DEX-treated female rat liver microsomes have properties similar to those of humans. 4. After oral administration of midazolam, the plasma midazolam concentration in DEX-treated female rats significantly decreased compared with control female rats. The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) and elimination half-life were one-11th and one-20th of those of control female rats, respectively. 5. Using DEX-treated female rats, the effect of CYP3A inhibitors on midazolam pharmacokinetics was evaluated. The AUC and maximum concentration in plasma (C(max)) increased when ketoconazole was co-administered with midazolam. 6. It was shown that the drug-drug interaction that occurs in vitro is also observed in vivo after oral administration of midazolam. In conclusion, the DEX-treated female rat could be a useful model for evaluating drug-drug interactions based on CYP3A enzyme inhibition.", 
    "159": "1. Anti-human cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 antiserum completely inhibited midazolam metabolism in monkey liver microsomes, suggesting that midazolam was mainly metabolized by CYP3A enzyme(s) in monkey liver microsomes. 2. Midazolam metabolism was also inhibited in vitro by typical chemical inhibitors of CYP3A, such as ketoconazole, erythromycin and diltiazem, and the apparent K(i) values for ketoconazole, erythromycin and diltiazem were 0.127, 94.2 and 29.6 microM, respectively. 3. CYP3A inhibitors increased plasma midazolam concentrations when midazolam and CYP3A inhibitors were co-administered orally. However, the pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam were not changed by treatment with CYP3A inhibitors when midazolam was given intravenously. This suggests that CYP3A inhibitors modified the first-pass metabolism in the liver and/or intestine, but not systemic metabolism. 4. The drug-drug interaction responsible for CYP3A enzyme(s) inhibition was observed when midazolam and inhibitors were co-administrated orally. Therefore, it was concluded that monkeys given midazolam orally could be useful models for predicting drug-drug interactions in man based on CYP3A enzyme inhibition.", 
    "160": "Since the introduction of chlorpromazine, an increasing number of drugs have been added to the list of antipsychotics (neuroleptics). These drugs can be further classified as either first-generation antipsychotics (FAPs) or second-generation antipsychotics (SAPs), depending on their ability to antagonize serotonine in addition to dopamine. The efficacy of various drugs is generally equal, whereas both pharmacological profiles and side-effects differ. Antipsychotic drug therapy recommendations are available both in Norway and internationally, and the purpose of this cross-sectional survey was to register the use of these drugs in representative mental hospitals (A and B), and compare our findings to the recommendations. Medical prescriptions were registered, and data further analysed. In hospital A, a total of 149 patients' prescriptions were registered. Antipsychotics were received voluntarily by 117 patients. Eighty-two of these used one antipsychotic drug, and in this group, 65% received SAPs. Antipsychotic combination therapy was received by 35 patients, and was associated with higher prescription rates of both anticholinergics and benzodiazepines. SAPs were not associated with increased use of benzodiazepines, compared to FAPs. Antipsychotics were frequently combined with mood stabilizers and antidepressants. Our findings in hospital A concerning therapy practices of antipsychotics, were confirmed in hospital B, where 64 patients' medical prescriptions were registered. We conclude that FAPs are still commonly prescribed. Antipsychotic combination therapy is used despite of lack of evidence for efficacy, and is associated with increased prescription rates of anticholinergics and benzodiazepines.", 
    "161": "Collagen and collagen-related peptide (CRP) activate platelets by interacting with glycoprotein (GP)VI. In addition, collagen binds to integrin alpha2beta1 and possibly to other receptors. In this study, we have compared the role of integrins alpha2beta1 and alphaIIbbeta3 in platelet activation induced by collagen and CRP. Inhibitors of ADP and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) substantially attenuated collagen-induced platelet aggregation and dense granule release, whereas CRP-induced responses were only partially inhibited. Under these conditions, a proportion of platelets adhered to the collagen fibres resulting in dense granule release and alphaIIbbeta3 activation. This adhesion was substantially mediated by alpha2beta1. The alphaIIbbeta3 antagonist lotrafiban potentiated CRP-induced dense granule release, suggesting that alphaIIbbeta3 outside-in signalling may attenuate GPVI signals. By contrast, lotrafiban inhibited collagen-induced dense granule release. These results emphasise the differential roles of alpha2beta1 and alphaIIbbeta3 in platelet activation induced by collagen and CRP. Further, they show that although ADP and TxA2 greatly facilitate collagen-induced platelet activation, collagen can induce full activation of those platelets to which it binds in the absence of these mediators, via a mechanism that is dependent on adhesion to alpha2beta1.", 
    "162": "The existing literature on the prevalence of drug driving, the effects of drugs on driving performance, risk factors and risk perceptions associated with drug driving was reviewed. The 12-month prevalence of drug driving among the general population is approximately 4%. Drugs are detected commonly among those involved in motor vehicle accidents, with studies reporting up to 25% of accident-involved drivers positive for drugs. Cannabis is generally the most common drug detected in accident-involved drivers, followed by benzodiazepines, cocaine, amphetamines and opioids. Polydrug use is common among accident-involved drivers. Studies of impairment indicate an undeniable association between alcohol and driving impairment. There is also evidence that cannabis and benzodiazepines increase accident risk. The most equivocal evidence surrounds opioids and stimulants. It is apparent that drugs in combination with alcohol, and multiple drugs, present an even greater risk. Demographically, young males are over-represented among drug drivers. Although there is an association between alcohol use problems and drink driving, it is unclear whether such an association exists between drug use problems and drug driving. Evidence surrounding psychosocial factors and driving behaviour is also equivocal at this stage. While most drivers perceive drug driving to be dangerous and unacceptable, there is less concern about impaired driving among drug drivers and drink drivers than from those who have not engaged in impaired driving. Risk perceptions differ according to drug type, with certain drugs (e.g. cannabis) seen as producing less impairment than others (e.g. alcohol). It is concluded that drug driving is a significant problem, both in terms of a general public health issue and as a specific concern for drug users.", 
    "163": "This study investigated the health status of a representative sample of clients (35 Maori, 72 non-Maori) receiving methadone maintenance treatment in New Zealand, using the SF-36 health survey. The publication of New Zealand norms in 1999 enabled comparisons of the health of the Methadone Treatment Programme study participants with that of the New Zealand population. Although over 50% of participants rated their health as good, very good or excellent, 44% rated their health as fair or poor and compared with population norms, the health of the study participants was significantly poorer on all eight SF-36 scales. Male and female participants rated their health similarly to male and female clients attending another New Zealand Methadone Treatment Programme. Results highlighted the impact of a chronic disorder and co-existing health-related problems on the health and well-being and day-to-day functioning of this client group. Higher frequency of benzodiazepine use was associated with poorer social functioning, mental health and role functioning and higher frequency of cannabis use was associated with poorer role functioning due to emotional problems. Findings support routine monitoring of health status with clients receiving methadone maintenance treatment as a guide to preventative and treatment interventions and health maintenance strategies.",
