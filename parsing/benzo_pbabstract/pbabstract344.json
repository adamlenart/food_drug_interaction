After isoflurane-induced general anesthesia, group 1 (n = 12) received sham CCT with no pretreatment, group 2 received CCT with no pretreatment, group 3 received CCT with pirenzepine pretreatment (0.01/mg/kg IP), and group 4 received CCT with ephedrine pretreatment (3 mg/kg IP). Six hours after intervention, all the rats were euthanized with isoflurane, stomachs were dissected, and a gastric ulcer index was determined.",

    "4": "Suppression of sham feeding by exogenous CCK-8 or intraintestinal oleate infusion is attenuated by peripheral administration of the CCK-A receptor antagonist, devazepide, but not by the CCK-B antagonist, L365260. Likewise, systemically administered devazepide increases food intake by real feeding rats. These results suggest that endogenous CCK participates in the reduction of food intake by intestinal oleate and ingested food. Although originally categorized as a \"peripheral\" receptor subtype, the CCK-A receptor is also present in the brain. In an effort to examine whether devazepide acts in the brain or in the periphery to attenuate suppression of food intake by intraintestinal oleate, we injected devazepide into the lateral or fourth cerebral ventricles of intraintestinally infused, sham-fed rats. We also compared the ability of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) devazepide to elicit increased food intake in real feeding rats. Doses of devazepide that were sufficient to attenuate or abolish oleate-induced suppression of sham feeding, when administered i.p., failed to attenuate suppression of intake when administered i.c.v., i.p. devazepide also was more effective than i.c.v. devazepide for attenuation of the suppression of sham feeding by i.p. injection of exogenous CCK-8. Finally, i.c.v. devazepide was ineffective for increasing real food intake, whereas the same dose administered i.p. significantly increased food intake. Our results do not support participation of brain CCK-A receptors in the suppression of food intake by exogenous CCK, or by endogenous CCK released after intraintestinal oleate infusion, or food intake.",

Fura-2-loaded pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells were continuously superfused with phenylephrine (10 microM) at 37 degrees C on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope. Intracellular free calcium was measured using a dual wavelength spectrofluorometer. After establishment of steady-state intracellular free calcium oscillations induced by phenylephrine, lorazepam, diazepam, or midazolam was added to the superfusate. The amplitude and frequency of the intracellular free calcium oscillations were compared before and after addition of each agent.", 
    "7": "Resting mean +/- SEM values of intracellular free calcium were 68 +/- 8 nM. Phenylephrine stimulated dose-dependent oscillations in intracellular free calcium, which reached a peak concentration of 676 +/- 35 nM and a frequency of 1.08 +/- 0.1 transients/min. Addition of lorazepam (1 microM) inhibited (P < 0.05) the amplitude (591 +/- 32 nM) but not the frequency (0.97 +/- 0.1 transients/min) of the oscillations. Conversely, diazepam (1 microM) decreased (P < 0.05) the frequency (0.79 +/- 0.1 transients/min) but not the amplitude (663 +/- 37 nM) of the oscillations. These effects were dose-dependent. In contrast, midazolam (1-30 microM) had no effect on the amplitude or frequency of intracellular free calcium oscillations. At concentrations higher than 100 microM, however, all three benzodiazepines inhibited both the amplitude and frequency of the intracellular free calcium oscillations.",

    "9": "A 29-year-old man with C6 tetraplegia (ASIA A) using an implanted baclofen pump and intrathecal catheter infusion system for spasticity control developed severe spasticity, hyperthermia, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation after catheter disconnection. Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were necessary. Extensive workup for a concurrent infection was negative except for urine cultures. The patient remained febrile for 10 days despite empirical antibiotic trials. Administration of high-dose benzodiazepines was inadequate for spasticity control. Spasticity control and his clinical condition, including body temperature, did not improve until his catheter was surgically replaced and intrathecal baclofen administration was resumed. The pharmacopathology of abrupt baclofen withdrawal and the similarities between this presentation, sepsis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and malignant hyperthermia are discussed. High-dose dantrolene was not used; however, based on similarities between this patient's presentation and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, it may have been the drug of choice.", 
    "10": "North American river otters (Lutra canadensis) were anesthetized with tiletamine-zolazepam or tiletamine-zolazepam-flumazenil combinations in cooperation with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission Otter Restoration Project for evaluation of physiologic changes during anesthesia. Sixteen otters received tiletamine-zolazepam (4 mg/kg combined, i.m.) in 1994. Induction and recovery times were recorded and physiologic data (heart rate and rhythm, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, relative oxyhemoglobin saturation, and mean arterial blood pressure) were collected at 5-min intervals. Respiratory depression developed initially in all otters, and median relative oxyhemoglobin saturation remained below 90% for the first 15 min of anesthesia. Anesthetic induction with tiletamine-zolazepam was rapid and smooth, but recovery was prolonged (median = 89 min) and characterized by persistent head motion. In 1995, flumazenil was evaluated as a partial antagonist for tiletamine-zolazepam anesthesia in otters. Sixteen otters were anesthetized with tiletamine-zolazepam (4 mg/kg combined, i.m.) and given flumazenil (1 mg per 25 mg of zolazepam) after 20 min. Flumazenil markedly shortened recovery time in all otters anesthetized with tiletamine-zolazepam (median = 65 min) with no adverse effects.", 
    "11": "Remote thermal telemetry was performed on North American river otters (Lutra canadensis) during the 1995 North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission Otter Restoration Project. Otters were anesthetized with either ketamine-midazolam (n = 11) or tiletamine-zolazepam (n = 9) combinations. Based upon initial rectal temperatures, mild to moderate hyperthermia (39.4-40.5 degrees C) developed in five otters given ketamine-midazolam and three otters given tiletamine-zolazepam. Following anesthetic induction, each otter received an ingestible temperature transmitter. Dependent upon gastrointestinal transit time and transmitter battery life, core body temperature was monitored for up to 13.75 hr postanesthesia. Thermal telemetry revealed a gradual decline in core temperature in all otters after anesthetic recovery (30-60 min). Median core temperature stabilized subsequently within 0.3 degrees C of resting temperature (38.4 degrees C) 1.75 hr after initial injection in otters given tiletamine-zolazepam and 2.75 hr in otters given ketamine-midazolam. Minor fluctuations in body temperature (less than 1 degree C) occurred in most otters from 6 to 13.75 hr and were attributed to variations in physical activity.", 
    "12": "This paper explores the mode of action of the tranquillizers chloral hydrate and diazepam during fertilization and mitosis of the first reproductive cell cycles in sea urchin eggs. Most striking effects of these drugs are the alteration of centrosomal material and the abnormal microtubule configurations during exposure and after recovery from the drugs. This finding is utilized to study the mechanisms of centrosome compaction and decompaction and the dynamic configurational changes of centrosomal material and its interactions with microtubules. When 0.1% chloral hydrate or 350-750 microM diazepam is applied at specific phases during the first cell cycle of sea urchin eggs, expanded centrosomal material compacts at distinct regions and super-compacts into dense spheres while microtubules disassemble. When eggs are treated before pronuclear fusion, centrosomal material aggregates around each of the two pronuclei while microtubules disappear. Upon recovery, atypical asters oftentimes with multiple foci are formed from centrosomal material surrounding the pronuclei which indicates that the drugs have affected centrosomal material and prevent it from functioning normally. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies with antibodies that routinely stain centrosomes in sea urchin eggs (4D2; and Ah-6) depict centrosomal material that is altered when compared to control cells. This centrosomal material is not able to reform normal microtubule patterns upon recovery but will form multiple asters around the two pronuclei. When cells are treated with 0.1% chloral hydrate or 350-750 microM diazepam during mitosis, the bipolar centrosomal material becomes compacted and aggregates into multiple dense spheres while spindle and polar microtubules disassemble. With increased incubation time, the smaller dense centrosome particles aggregate into bigger and fewer spheres. Upon recovery, unusual irregular microtubule configurations are formed from centrosomes that have lost their ability to reform normal mitotic figures. These results indicate that chloral hydrate and diazepam affect centrosome structure which results in the inability to reform normal microtubule formations and causes abnormal fertilization and mitosis.",

Many neonatologists face a difficult decision on whether or not to use a muscle relaxant on a ventilated infant. This article reviews neonatal physiology and pharmacology, drug administration, absorption, distribution, and certain selected sedatives and analgesics. The muscle relaxants, financial issues, and family issues are also discussed.",

The resulting complex three-dimensional density maps are first simplified into connected graphs using topological analysis. Then, an original genetic algorithm method, GAGS (Genetic Algorithm for Graph Similarity search), is developed and implemented in order to compare the connected graphs. Finally, the analysis of the best solutions of the algorithm are expressed in terms of functional group superimpositions. The GAGS analysis is applied to different resolution levels of the electron density maps and the resulting models are compared in order to assess the influence of the resolution on the resulting pharmacophore models.", 
    "15": "In the Berlin Aging Study (BASE) an age and gender stratified sample of 516 persons aged 70 to over 100 was assessed by means of the semi-structured GMS-A interview, the CES-D-self-rating scale and the Hamiltion-Depression-observer-rating scale. Prevalence rates were 4.8% for Major Depression, 9.1% for all DSM III-R specified depressive disorders and 26.9% of subthreshold depression was included. There was no increase in prevalence rates with age but an increase in scores on the self rating CES-D. The prevalence rates for DSM III-R specified depression in females was 10.3% and almost double that of men (5.6%). Depressed persons do not show significant cognitive impairment as measured with the MMSE in comparison to controls. As compared to the total sample higher prevalence rates of overall depression were seen in persons with multimorbidity (36.8%) and lower rates in married persons. 13.2% of the elderly talked about feeling tired with life, 7.9% had thoughts about death and 1.2% reported suicidal ideation, which was closely linked to depressive disorders. In 44% of depressed cases undertreatment was observed. Only 6% got Antidepressants but 40% benzodiazepines.", 
    "16": "Approximately one-third of all pregnant women take psychotropic drugs at least once during pregnancy. At the same time, there are no preparations on the market that can be considered entirely appropriate for expectant mothers. The effects of psychopharmacological therapies have exclusively been discussed in the context of their risk during the first trimester. However, treatment after this phase is not absolutely without risk, and it is striking that there are grave differences between various substances. There are currently controversial discussions going on in literature as far as the teratogenicity of lithium is concerned, especially during the formation of the heart. It is suggested that the risk for congenital malformations is increased after intrauterine lithium exposure, whereas such a risk cannot be proved for most of the antidepressants and neuroleptics. Still, it should be noted that psychopharmacology is not harmless even after the organogenesis, as intrauterine exposure during the 2nd and 3rd trimester can lead to postnatal complications. For example, floppy-infant syndrome after taking benzodiazepines, and the extrapyramidal-motor effects on the newborn after neuroleptic therapy during pregnancy should be mentioned.", 
    "17": "Calcium-channel blockers reduce the in vitro effects of hypothermia and benzodiazepines have been reported to reduce inward calcium flow through L-type cardiac-calcium channels. Thus, this study was designed to determine if diazepam could reduce hypothermia-induced changes in ventricular papillary muscle electromechanical activity. Conventional microelectrode techniques were used while force was recorded using a miniature force transducer. Six experimental groups of electrically paced papillary muscles were formed (n = 6 per group). One was exposed to one microM nisoldipine and four were exposed to one of four diazepam concentrations (0.1, 1.0, 10 or 100 microM). A final group had no drug and provided a time-matched control. The effects were determined at 37 degrees C and then at 27 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, diazepam initially increased and then reduced inotropy and APD90. Nisoldipine reduced both APD90 and inotropy. At 27 degrees C, 100 microM diazepam and nisoldipine (1.0 microM) reduced the hypothermia-induced lengthening of APD and the increase in force. Although diazepam reduced the hypothermia-induced alterations, the concentration required to do so (100 microM) suggests that this effect has little role in clinical use.", 
    "18": "The effects of adding midazolam and bupivacaine to human cerebrospinal fluid in glass test tubes were examined by looking for changes in pH and a reduction in the transparency of the solution. Midazolam (n = 6), 0.25% bupivacaine (n = 6), 5 mg of midazolam in 6 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine (n = 6) and 5 mg of midazolam in 10 mL of saline (n = 6) were added to 1.5-mL samples (n = 24) of cerebrospinal fluid taken at the time spinal anaesthesia was begun. Transparency and pH were checked after each increment. Cerebrospinal pH was decreased to below 7.0 by adding more than 3 mg of midazolam, more than 1.9 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine or 1.3 mL of the mixture. Cerebrospinal transparency was decreased by adding more than 0.7 mg of midazolam, 1.1 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine or 0.6 mL of the mixture. Midazolam in saline neither decreased the pH below 7.0 nor reduced transparency. These results do not suggest that clinically useful doses of intrathecal or epidural midazolam are neurotoxic.", 
    "19": "Symptoms of anxiety and depression often appear together in patients, either as 2 discrete disorders, such as major depressive disorder and panic disorder, or as a combination of symptoms not meeting criteria for specific disorders. The social, economic, occupational and medical costs of such comorbid anxiety and depression can be enormous, affecting both the individual and society.The clinician must be creative when treating patients with mixed anxiety and depressive symptoms; psychopharmacological treatment can involve the use of a variety of mono- and polytherapies. Benzodiazepines can be effective in treating anxiety symptoms, but unwanted adverse effects limit their use to the short term. Tricyclic antidepressants, although proven to be effective in treating both anxiety and depressive symptoms, have numerous adverse effects, making them a second-choice therapy. Traditional monoamine oxidase inhibitors have proven efficacy in atypical depression, and the newer reversible and selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase-A may prove to be very effective in treating both sets of symptoms. Of particular importance in the treatment of patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms are the selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors, nefazodone and the azapirones (including buspirone).", 
    "20": "Over the last two decades, drug and alcohol abuse by pregnant women has spread to epidemic proportions. Maternal drug abuse has neurobehavioral and somatic effects which may be long-lasting and devastating to the offspring. Opiates, such as heroin and pain killers that contain a narcotic component, are widely abused today. A prominent manifestation of fetal exposure to these drugs is the neonatal withdrawal syndrome, which typically includes wakefulness, jitteriness and other symptoms of cerebral irritability. These, in turn, may interrupt early mother-infant interaction, affecting the infant's long-term emotional and cognitive development. Fetal cocaine exposure may cause neonatal cerebral irritability, changes in habituation responses, reduced head circumference, poor mental development and long-lasting impairment of the brain. Benzodiazepines can cause fetal dysmorphism (including microcephaly), neurological and behavioral impairments and neonatal withdrawal symptoms. Maternal use of amphetamines may cause neonatal dysphoria and agitation, as well as long-term lassitude and drowsiness that may result in poor feeding. Fetal exposure to alcohol may cause neonatal withdrawal symptoms, maladaptive behavior in childhood and the fetal alcohol syndrome (including microcephaly). Maternal alcohol consumption is also a common cause of mental retardation. Fetal exposure to marijuana may delay maturation of the visual system and impair memory and verbal performance at 2 years of age. The inevitable conclusion is that society must seek ways not only to treat, but also to prevent this epidemic. To this end, a key factor would be to identify potential drug abusing mothers before they reach the stage of prenatal care and educate them regarding the fatal consequences of drug abuse.", 
    "21": "Bacopa monniera Wettst. (syn. Herpestis monniera L.; Hindi - Brahmi) is classified in Ayurveda, the classical Indian system of medicine, as Medhyarasayana, a group of plant derived drugs used as nervine tonics to promote mental health and improve memory and intellect. Earlier experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated the memory-promoting action of the plant extracts and that of its active saponins, bacoside A and B. The present study was designed to investigate the anxiolytic activity of a standardized extract (bacoside A content 25.5 \u00b1 0.8%) of B. monniera (BM), since the plant is used in Ayurveda in clinical conditions resembling the modern concept of anxiety disorders. The animal models used have been extensively validated as experimental models of anxiety and included the open-field, elevated plusmaze, social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding latency tests in rats. BM was used at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, p.o. and the results were compared with those elicited by lorazepam, a well known benzodiazepine anxiolytic, used at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, i.p. BM produced a dose-related anxiolytic activity, qualitatively comparable to that of lorazepam, in all the test parameters. However, statistically significant results were elicited usually by the higher two doses of BM. BM did not produce any significant motor deficit, at the doses used, as was evidenced by using the rota-rod test. The findings correlate with the clinical use of the plant in Ayurveda. The advantage of B. monniera over the widely used benzodiazepine anxiolytics lies in the fact that it promotes cognition unlike the amnesic action of the latter.", 
    "22": "Benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) agonists and inverse agonists yield generally opposing effects on GABAergic transmission, and the functional consequences of these ligands are often bidirectional. BZR agonists exert anxiolytic effects, whereas the BZR partial inverse agonist FG 7142 has been reported to have anxiogenic actions in a variety of paradigms. In keeping with this literature, we found that the cardioacceleratory defensive response is enhanced by FG 7142, and attenuated by the BZR agonist chlordiazepoxide. In contrast, both compounds attenuated basal and fear-potentiated somatic startle responses. This did not appear to reflect a global reduction of startle reactivity, however, as the cardiac startle response was not significantly altered. These findings support the view that multiple substrates underlie distinct aspects or features of fear and anxiety. The results are consistent with the suggestion that FG 7142 may selectively enhance those aspects of anxiety that depend on cortical-cognitive processing.", 
    "23": "The present study was carried out to investigate a possible interaction between the effects of anxiety modulating drugs which act at the GABA-A receptor complex and selective N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) coupled glycine receptor (GLY-B receptor) ligands within the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG). The plus-maze performance of rats pretreated with diazepam (0.37 and 0.75 mg/kg, i.p.) or pentylenetetrazole (15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.), standard anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs respectively, was assessed following intra-periaqueductal injections of either glycine (0.2 M, 0.4 microl/30 s, i.c.) or its competitive antagonist, 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7ClKYN, 0.02 M, 0.4 microl/30 s, i.c.). Whilst diazepam produced a typical anxiolytic effect in intracranially-injected CSF rats, increasing open arm exploration, pentylenetetrazole displayed an opposite anxiogenic profile. Either anxiogenic or anxiolytic effects were seen in peripherally-injected vehicle rats following intra-periaqueductal injections of glycine or 7ClKYN, respectively. Intra-periaqueductal injection of glycine markedly attenuated the anxiolytic effect of diazepam. Moreover, while the anxiogenic effects of pentylenetetrazole were barely changed by glycine, they were markedly attenuated by intra-periaqueductal injection of 7ClKYN. Interaction of diazepam and 7ClKYN produced non-selective sedative-like effects which masked any possible anxiolytic action. Accordingly, the present results suggest that the NMDA-coupled glycine receptors located in the DPAG interfere with anxioselective effects of GABA-A acting drugs on the elevated plus-maze. In spite of the prevailing notion that the NMDA coupled glycine receptor is saturated at in vivo brain concentrations of glycine, our results also suggest that either unoccupied or low-affinity GLY-B receptors are likely to be activated by glycine injection into DPAG.", 
    "24": "The evaluation, treatment and care of patients with dementia are major tasks for the health service. This paper provides an overview of drug treatment of the emotional and cognitive disturbances of dementia. Tricyclic and the newer anti-depressive agents are effective in patients with dementia and depression. Dopamine-blocking agents are effective for some patients with dementia and psychosis, but their use is limited by frequent and severe side-effects. Atypical neuroleptics may prove useful for this patient group. Aggression and agitation may be treated with serotonergic agents, neuroleptics, or benzodiazepines, but other strategies may also be useful. Cholinesterase-inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy on cognition and function, and may reduce the likelihood of institutionalization. Studies of possible stabilization therapies, such as trophic factors, propentophylline, and antiamyloid drugs, are reviewed. Recent reports suggesting a possible prophylactic effect of antioxidants, oestrogen, and antiinflammatory drugs are discussed. The substantial efforts now being made to discover effective drugs for dementia suggest that compounds that delay the disease progression may be available in the next 5-10 years.", 
    "25": "Four in vitro precipitation methods were tested and evaluated using flavopiridol and diazepam formulations. The methods include static serial dilution, dynamic injection, and dropwise addition with and without stirring. The results generated from these methods are comparable and complementary. The static serial dilution method is most effective in quantifying the amount of precipitation and more descriptive of the formation and redissolution of the precipitate than the others. The dynamic injection method, however, has its merit in more realistically simulating the physiological environment of drug-blood interaction near the injection sites.", 
    "26": "The ability of the cholecystokinin B (CCKB) receptor antagonist L-365,260 to modulate the antinociceptive action of systemic morphine was investigated using the well established rat model of localized inflammation induced by intraplantar injection of carrageenin. The effects of morphine (0.1-1 mg/kg i.v.) alone or in combination with the CCKB receptor antagonist (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) were determined at different time-points (at 1, 3 and 24 h) after the injection of carrageenin by measuring the vocalization threshold to paw pressure. L-365,260 was found to be ineffective in modulating the responses to all doses of morphine at 1 and 24 h after carrageenin. By contrast, at 3 h, the CCKB receptor antagonist reversed the ineffectiveness of the low dose (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) of morphine on the inflamed paw. Further, in the L-365,260-pretreated rats, a significant correlation between the antinociceptive effect of the low dose (0.1 mg/kg) of morphine and the intensity of the mechanical hyperalgesia was observed, indicating that the CCK control of the degree of sensitivity to opioids can vary among-the animals. Our data illustrate a differential and limited effect of L-365,260 on opioid antinociception in carrageenin-injected rats, depending on the dose of morphine, the phase of inflammation and the intensity of hyperalgesia.", 
    "27": "Recent evidence suggests that central pain, i.e., pain due to central nervous system damage, may be due to a deranged neurotransmission between the sensory thalamus and sensory cortical areas. Central pain can be controlled either by opposing glutamate neurotransmission or potentiating GABAergic transmission. It is speculated that a relative hypofunction of the GABAergic inhibition both at thalamic and cortical levels leads to a sectorial excitatory hypertonus in those same areas. A blend of the two should mark each patient. A pharmacological dissection approach is provided that should optimize the treatment, up to now globally poor, of central pain.", 
    "28": "We have characterized in vitro the muscarinic receptors mediating the contraction of the detrusor muscle in Cynomolgus monkeys and guinea pigs using carbachol as the agonist and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP, M3-selective), methoctramine (M2-selective) and pirenzepine (M1-selective) as the antagonists. Carbachol induced a concentration-dependent contraction of the detrusor muscle of monkey and guinea pig yielding similar pD2 values of 6.67+/-0.03 (n=50) and 6.77+/-0.06 (n=36), respectively. In the detrusor muscle of Cynomolgus monkey, all antagonists produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of carbachol-induced contractions, without decreasing the maximal response. Schild plot analysis yielded slopes not different from unity for all antagonists. The order of antagonist potency was: 4-DAMP (pA2=8.96)>pirenzepine (pA2=6.66)>methoctramine (pA2=6.03), suggesting that M3 receptors have a dominant role in mediating detrusor contraction. In the detrusor muscle of the guinea pig, 4-DAMP and pirenzepine, but not methoctramine, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the carbachol-induced contractions, without decreasing the maximal response. Schild plot analysis yielded a slope not different from unity for 4-DAMP and pirenzepine. 4-DAMP (pA2=9.07) had a higher potency than pirenzepine (pA2=6.66), a finding consistent with previously published data. The present study shows that in Cynomolgus monkey stimulation of the M3 subtype is dominant in mediating detrusor contraction upon carbachol stimulation.", 
    "29": "The effects of S-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-4-isoxozolepropionic acid (AMPA) lesions of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis on the M1/M2 nature of the responses of somatosensory cortical neurones to acetylcholine (ACh) in Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated by iontophoretic application and extracellular single unit recording. The responses were characterised using pirenzepine, an M1 receptor antagonist, and gallamine, an M2 antagonist. Eighty two neurones in control and 94 neurones in lesioned animals were studied. In control animals, 37% of responses to ACh were sensitive to pirenzepine, gallamine or to both antagonists. This increased to 62% in lesioned animals, the proportions of pirenzepine- and gallamine-sensitive responses remaining unchanged. These results provide the first electrophysiological confirmation that both pirenzepine- and gallamine-sensitive (M1 and M2) receptors occur postsynaptic to afferent cholinergic terminals and that their postsynaptic stimulation may produce both inhibition and excitation.",

    "37": "Participants taking temazepam at 5300 m showed no significant drop in mean oxygen saturation values during sleep. Both the number and severity of changes in saturation during sleep decreased and the quality of sleep improved.

This has the effect of improving the quality of sleep and reducing the number of periods of desaturation during sleep.", 
    "38": "Using unanesthetized young male and female beagle dogs, before and after a 2-day fast, we studied the effect of an i.v. infusion of 0.9% saline (5 ml/h), somatostatin (SS, 4 or 8 micrograms/kg/h), or pretreatment with pirenzepine (PZ, 0.6 mg/kg i.v.), a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist which allegedly releases SS, on the GH release evoked by acute administration of GHRH (2 micrograms/kg i.v.), hexarelin (HEXA), a member of the GH-releasing peptide family (250 micrograms/kg i.v.) or GHRH plus HEXA. In fasted dogs, GHRH delivered during saline infusion induced a clear-cut rise in plasma GH levels, significantly higher than that which it induced in fed dogs. In contrast, HEXA, although very effective in causing the release of GH, only slightly increased GH secretion in fasted dogs over that which it induced in fed dogs. Co-administration of GHRH plus HEXA into fed dogs induced a synergic GH response that further increased with fasting. The action of GHRH in fed dogs was abolished by the lower dose of SS, whereas SS at either dose was ineffective in suppressing the GH-releasing effect during fasting. Infusion of the lower dose of SS failed to counter the action of HEXA, either before or during fasting, whilst the higher SS dose partially reduced it in both conditions. In contrast to SS, PZ reduced the GH-releasing effect of GHRH and HEXA, both in the fed state and, though to a lesser extent, during fasting. Pirenzepine only slightly reduced the robust GH rise elicited by GHRH plus HEXA in fed dogs. The suppressive effect of PZ on the GH response to combined administration of the peptides was lowest in fasted dogs. These data show that: (1) fasting augmented the GH response to GHRH and (to a lesser degree) to HEXA; (2) SS inhibited the GH response to GHRH in the fed state, but not in the fasted state; (3) only the higher dose of SS partially reduced the GH stimulation by HEXA in either the fed or the fasted state; (4) PZ lowered the GH response to GHRH and to HEXA in both the fed and (to a lesser degree) the fasted state; (5) PZ did not modify the GH release due to the combined administration of GHRH and HEXA. It is suggested that: (1) during fasting the greatly enhanced GH response to GHRH alone or GHRH plus HEXA probably reflects an augmented GHRH secretion; (2) somatotrope refractoriness to SS may contribute to the enhanced GH secretion in states of calorie deprivation; (3) in contrast to a general belief, muscarinic cholinergic antagonists, e.g. PZ, do not act exclusively via release of SS, but probably also through inhibition of GHRH function.", 
    "39": "A sensitive, simple and rapid method without sample pretreatment is presented for the simultaneous determination of flunitrazepam and its main metabolites (norflunitrazepam, 7-amino- and 7-acetamidoflunitrazepam) in urine. The single-step procedure is based on a column-switching technique which uses an immobilized antibody in an extraction column following concentration on a precolumn and separation on an analytical column. UV detection was performed at 254 nm. The reusability of the antibody exceeds 88 runs and a complete analysis was performed in less than 40 min. The method shows coefficients of variation below 9.9% and rates of recovery greater than 92% tested at the level of 50 ng/ml urine. The limit of detection was below 2 ng/ml urine for the four compounds.",

We also describe a comparison of the 1.5-microm nonporous silica C18 column versus 3.5-microm porous silica C18 columns. The final method using the 1.5-microm nonporous silica column demonstrated good precision (of both quantification and retention time), accuracy and recovery, linearity of dilution and limit of quantification (40 ng/ml Ro 48-3656 using a 20 microl injection). Samples of neat EDTA rat plasma were prepared by ultrafiltration followed by direct injection onto the HPLC column.", 
    "41": "In order to assess how many general practice patients take benzodiazepines for long periods, a cross-sectional audit of clinical practice was conducted. During a 3-day census period, 26 general practitioners in the area of Bergamo, Italy, entered into the study every patient who was taking benzodiazepines. The prevalence of use of this class of drugs was 14.0% (CI 12.5-15.7), while the prevalence of daily use for 12 months or more was 4.7% (CI 3.8-5.8). Finally, the prevalence of very long-term use of benzodiazepines, i.e. those taking these drugs for more than 10 years, was 0.65% (CI 0.34-1.14). Compared to non-long-term users, long-term users were older (OR 2.38, CI 1.39-4.08) and had a lower level of education (OR 2.40, CI 1.04-5.54). In addition, insomnia was associated with long-term use of this class of drugs (OR 1.82, CI 1.02-3.24). These findings provide evidence that the long-term use of benzodiazepines is an important issue in everyday general practice and that this calls for precise management tactics.", 
    "42": "A benzodiazepine (midazolam), injected either systemically or directly into the basolateral amygdala (BLA), differentially affected the acquisition of fear responses to a shocked context: Administration of the drug before conditioning impaired subsequent freezing to the context but spared analgesic responses in rats tested there for sensitivity to formalin pain. Moreover, the pain test not only revealed evidence for analgesic responses but also served to reinstate conditioned freezing that was otherwise absent in rats conditioned under midazolam. The results were interpreted as showing that the presence of noxious stimulation on test serves either (a) to assist in retrieval of the context-shock association whose storage had been modified by midazolam's action in the BLA, or (b) to enable performance of the context-shock association whose affective properties had been blocked by midazolam's action in the BLA.",

Six elective surgical patients received a dose of 1.0 mg flumazenil in 10 mL saline intratracheally during general anesthesia. Blood samples were drawn for 6 hours after administration and plasma concentrations were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). An average peak plasma flumazenil concentration of 65.9 +/- 43.1 ng/mL was attained within 1 minute after administration. No patients reported chest discomfort or dyspnea upon awakening and there were no other side effects noted. Administration of flumazenil via an endotracheal tube results in rapid attainment of therapeutic blood levels.", 
    "44": "To determine whether the success rate for endotracheal intubation improves after implementing the use of neuromuscular blocking (NMB) agents in an air medical program, this retrospective study analyzed all patients requiring endotracheal intubation at two air medical programs (nurse/paramedic crews) over a 5-year period. Air medical program A, the control group, had employed NMB agents throughout the entire study period. Air medical program B, which did not use NMB agents from July 1, 1989 through June 30, 1992, implemented their use starting July 1, 1992. For program A, the overall intubation success rate was 93.5% (202 successful intubations in 216 patients) and the successful intubations/total attempts ratio was 0.67 (202 of 301). For program B, the overall intubation success rate improved from 66.7% (46 successful intubations in 69 patients) before NMB agent use to 90.5% (57 in 63) after NMB agent use (P = .001). The successful intubations/total attempts ratio increased from 0.36 (51 of 141) prior to NMB agent use to 0.48 (63 of 132) after NMB agent use (P = NS). In comparing the 92 patients who did not receive NMB agents to the 40 patients who did, the intubation success rate increased from 69.6% (64 of 92) to 97.5% (39 of 40) (P < .001) and the successful intubation/total attempts ratio increased from 0.36 (73 of 202) to 0.58 (41 of 71) (P = .007). With the use of NMB agents, program B's overall intubation success rate increased significantly, matching the results of program A.", 
    "45": "To test the respiratory effects of benzodiazepines in an established animal model of central apnea, we administered nonhypnotic and hypnotic doses of diazepam to nine adult male Sprague-Dawley rats chronically instrumented for sleep staging. In random order on separate days, rats were recorded following intraperitoneal injection of: (1) saline; (2) 0.05 mg/kg diazepam; or (3) 5 mg/kg diazepam. Normalized inspiratory minute ventilation increased significantly during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep following each dose of diazepam (p < 0.003 in each case) and following the highest dose during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (p = 0.01). In accord with this respiratory stimulation, non-REM-related spontaneous and post-sigh apnea expression decreased following each dose of diazepam (p = 0.006 to 0.04), but REM-related apnea expression was unaffected despite significant respiratory stimulation. The durations of non-REM and REM sleep were unaffected by the low dose, but following 5 mg/kg of diazepam non-REM sleep was increased (p = 0.03) and REM sleep was decreased (p = 0.009). We conclude that both hypnotic and non-hypnotic doses of benzodiazepines may be associated with suppression of sleep-related central apnea. We further conclude that non-REM and REM-related apneas arise from at least partially distinct mechanisms.", 
    "46": "The neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) has been shown to interact with dopamine in various ways, including attenuation of dopamine D1 receptor-mediated vacuous chewing and grooming. While we have demonstrated a clear role for the CCK(A) receptor in the attenuation of dopamine D1 agonist-induced vacuous chewing, studies of grooming yielded anomalous results. We examined the effects of selective CCK receptor antagonists on the attenuation of SKF 38393-induced grooming by the CCKB agonist CCK-4. Administration of SKF 38393 (5 mg/kg s.c.) to male Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in a significant increase in grooming which was reduced to control levels by CCK-4 (20 mg/kg i.p.). Pretreatment with either the CCKA receptor antagonist devazepide or the CCK(B) receptor antagonist L-365,260 significantly attenuated this effect over a range of doses (20, 100, 500 microg/kg i.p.). The suppression of dopamine D1 agonist-induced grooming by CCK-4 does not appear to reflect a non-specific effect of anxiogenesis, as it was unaffected by the anxiolytic diazepam. The CCK receptor antagonists alone were without behavioural effect. Taken together with previous studies in models of anxiety and analgesia, our findings lend further support to the hypothesis that CCK-4 may act at a novel receptor subtype.", 
    "47": "Intrastriatal injection of the GABA(A) antagonist, bicuculline, caused about a 75% decrease in the inhibitory effect of the central-type benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist, clonazepam or the indoleamine hormone, melatonin, on apomorphine-induced rotation in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of dopaminergic supersensitivity. Pretreatment with the peripheral-type BZ antagonist, PK 11195 (intrastriatally or intraperitoneally), also attenuated the antidopaminergic effect of these drugs but with much less potency than bicuculline. However, the combination of both bicuculline and PK 11195, injected directly into the striatum, completely blocked the antidopaminergic action of clonazepam or melatonin. These results indicate that the antidopaminergic action of clonazepam and melatonin in the striatum involves two distinct mechanisms: (1) a predominant GABAergic activation via the BZ/GABA(A) receptor complex, and (2) a secondary mechanism linked to a PK 11195-sensitive BZ receptor pathway. Recent studies indicate that PK 11195 blocks BZ-induced inhibition of the adenylyl cyclase-cyclic AMP pathway in the striatum. Since cyclic AMP has been implicated in the rotational behaviour of 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned animals, it is possible that the antidopaminergic action of clonazepam and melatonin also involves suppression of this second messenger.", 
    "48": "GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) isoforms in the central nervous system are composed of combinations of alpha(1-6), beta(1-4), gamma(1-4), delta(1) and epsilon(1) subunit subtypes arranged in a pentamer. Many regions of the brain express high levels of mRNA encoding several different subunits and even multiple subunit subtypes. The stoichiometry of GABAR isoforms is unclear, and the number and identity of individual subunit subtypes that are coassembled remain uncertain. To examine the role of beta subunit subtypes in the functional properties of GABARS and to determine whether multiple beta subtypes can be coassembled in functional GABARs, plasmids containing cDNAs encoding rat beta1 and/or beta3, alpha5 and gamma2L subtypes were cotransfected into L929 fibroblasts. The properties of the expressed receptor populations were determined using whole-cell and single-channel recording techniques. The alpha5beta1gamma2L isoform was less sensitive to GABA than the alpha5beta3gamma2L isoform. alpha5beta1gamma2L isoform currents were also insensitive to the allosteric modulator loreclezole, while alpha5beta3gamma2L isoform currents were strongly potentiated by loreclezole. Fibroblasts transfected with plasmids containing cDNAs for both beta1 and beta3 subtypes along with alpha5 and gamma2L subtypes produced a receptor population with an intermediate sensitivity to GABA which was insensitive to loreclezole. These results suggest that functional GABARs can be formed that contain two different beta1 subunit subtypes with properties different from receptors that contain only a single beta1 subtype and that the beta1 subunit subtypes influence the response of GABARs to GABA and to the allosteric modulator loreclezole.", 
    "49": "It was recently shown by others that the clearance of midazolam/kg body weight after iv administration correlates with hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP or P450) 3A content in liver transplant patients. However, after po administration midazolam undergoes significant first-pass metabolism, with significant intestinal extraction. The relationship between hepatic CYP3A and midazolam disposition after po administration had not previously been investigated. The aim of this study was to compare intraindividually hepatic CYP3A content and activity with the in vivo pharmacokinetics of midazolam (7.5 mg) administered po. For 15 patients scheduled for partial liver resection, the AUC values for the observed time period (AUC0-5hr) and to infinity (AUCinf) and the clearance were determined. In a macroscopically normal area of resected liver tissue, the microsomal CYP3A4 content (nanomoles per nanomole of total P450) was measured by immunoblot analysis and parameters (apparent Vmax, apparent KM, and intrinsic clearance) for the microsomal alpha-hydroxylation of midazolam were determined. Clearance/kg in vivo correlated with the apparent Vmax (r2 = 0.45, p < 0.01) and the CYP3A4 content (r2 = 0.29, p < 0.05). We conclude that interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of po administered midazolam is in part determined by interindividual variability in the hepatic microsomal Vmax for the alpha-hydroxylation of midazolam. However, the relationship between the disposition of midazolam administered po and hepatic CYP3A content is weaker than that reported after iv administration, indicating the importance of the contribution of intestinal CYP3A to the in vivo disposition of midazolam administered po.", 
    "50": "Fully differentiated pancreatic acinar cells can enter the cell cycle under appropriate conditions in the rat. The aim of this study was to analyse the diurnal pattern of acinar cell proliferation as a function of food intake and the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), because the peptide hormone CCK is a major physiological regulator of rat pancreatic acinar cell replication. Pancreatic acinar cell replication was quantitated using an antibody against the S-phase marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In addition, acinar cells in S-phase were detected after injecting bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and subsequent immunohistochemical staining of BrdU-positive nuclei. Rat pancreata were analysed during the day under standard diet conditions, as well as after various schedules of fasting and refeeding and after the application of the CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718. Between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., the PCNA labeling index was 4.4+/-0.9%, while between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m. the PCNA labeling index was elevated and reached peak values of 11.4% (mean value: 7.8+/-2.5%) around midnight. BrdU-positive cells also doubled around midnight, compared to the 9:00 a.m. value. In fasted rats, acinar cell proliferation was completely suppressed and this suppression could be overcome by injection of the CCK analog cerulein. In addition, the CCK antagonist L-364,718 led to the same results as fasting. Here we show for the first time that there is a diurnal pattern of pancreatic acinar cell proliferation in rats, which is dependent on food intake and is mediated by CCK.",

Replication of HIV-1/AZT was inhibited to a significantly greater extent by the combination of 3TC and quinoxaline HBY 097 than by either drug alone. Virus breakthrough was markedly delayed in the combined presence of 3TC and HBY 097 at drug concentrations as low as 0.05 microg/mL and 0.0025 microg/mL, respectively. The virus that was recovered after exposure to the compounds (3TC and HBY 097) individually had acquired, in the genetic AZT-resistance background of HIV-1/AZT, 103 Lys --> Glu and 106 Val --> Ala mutations. The 103 Lys --> Glu mutation had not been observed before. However, both virus mutants retained marked sensitivity to HBY 097. In all cases, the genotypic AZT-resistance mutations were maintained in the mutant virus RT genomes, and the viruses also remained phenotypically resistant to AZT. Given the exquisite potency of a concomitant combination of 3TC and HBY 097 in suppressing virus replication, this drug combination should be further pursued in clinical trials in HIV-1-infected individuals.",

The intensity of aggressive behaviors was assessed as 6-7 items on the CGI scale. After intramuscular injection of clorazepate complementing the so-called basic treatment in the mean daily dose of 150 mg, several hours lasting sedative effect was achieved. No unfavourable interactions between the applied clorazepate (Tranxene) and the other medicines applied simultaneously (mostly neuroleptics and antidepressant drugs) were observed.

    "54": "Myoclonus occasionally occurs in the perioperative setting and in patients on chronic opioid therapy. It appears to be dose-related in a unpredictable manner. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of a series of neuromuscular disturbances probably sharing final common pathways. A neuroexcitatory opioid metabolite accumulation has been proposed to have a relevant role in determining myoclonus in patients treated with chronic opioid therapy for cancer pain, especially in the presence of renal impairment. The neurological status, previous oncologic treatment and concomitant therapy with neuroleptic drugs, the metabolic and hydration status should also have been considered. Adjuvant drugs, such as benzodiazepines or dantrolene may avoid the reduction of the opioid dose while maintaining an acceptable analgesia. Current practice suggests a change in opioid when pain control is not obtained at opioid doses resulting in unacceptable adverse effects, including myoclonus and hyperalgesia. A change in the type of opioid may be useful in patients who develop severe central adverse effects, even if these patients appear to have normal renal function or hydration status.", 
    "55": "GABA(A) receptor plays a major role in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and is the target of drugs such as the benzodiazepine tranquilizers. The polymeric membrane protein nature of GABA(A) receptor has rendered structural elucidation of the receptor a formidable task, greatly hampering structure-based drug design. We report here the first expression in Escherichia coli of a fragment of GABA(A) receptor. This 131-residue fragment, spanning Cys166 to Leu296 of human GABAA receptor alpha1 subunit, contains residues previously suggested to be involved in benzodiazepine binding. The overexpressed non-fusion recombinant protein was purified to near homogeneity and characterized by circular dichroism (CD), which showed that the recombinant protein has well defined secondary structures where beta-strands are dominant. The stability of the secondary structures was demonstrated by CD spectra at high pH and elevated temperature. Excluding part of the sequences from the carboxyl terminal of the fragment resulted in dramatic changes in the secondary structures comparable to the effects caused by SDS denaturation. Our results therefore suggest that the 131-residue fragment harbors an integral structural domain of the receptor. The overexpression of the recombinant protein fragment thus opens the way to the biochemical and structural studies of a functionally important region of the receptor, and exemplifies an effective approach of expression and characterization that potentially may be extended to other members of the ligand gated channel receptor superfamily, to which the GABA(A) receptor belongs.",

Both compounds also showed toxicity in the brine shrimp lethality test with a LC50 of 37 micrograms/mL (compound 1) and 19 micrograms/mL (compound 2), respectively. The N-deacyl derivative did not show any remarkable effect in both bioassays. Cytotoxcity of the alkaloids was studied in vitro, using two human cell lines. The new derivative (3) appeared to be active in the same range of concentrations as kuanoniamine C (1) and D (2). The IC50 of 3 was 1.2 micrograms/mL toward HeLa cells and 2.0 micrograms/mL toward MONO-MAC 6 cells. In receptor binding assays compound 2 showed affinity to A1- and A2A-adenosine receptors with Ki values of 2.94 and 13.7 microM, respectively.

Immunohistochemical studies have recently shown the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)- and DBI-like immunoreactivity in the frog adrenal gland. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of two biologically active DBI-derived peptides, the triakontatetraneuropeptide [TTN; DBI(17-50)] and the octadecaneuropeptide [ODN; DBI(33-50)], on corticosteroid secretion by frog adrenocortical cells. Exposure of frog adrenal explants to graded concentrations of TTN (3.16 x 10(-8) to 3.16 x 10(-6) M) induced a dose-related increase in corticosterone and aldosterone secretion. In contrast, ODN did not modify corticosteroid output. When repeated pulses of TTN (10(-6) M) were administered at 2-h intervals, the response of the adrenal explants to the second dose of TTN was markedly reduced, suggesting the existence of a desensitization phenomenon. Exposure of dispersed adrenal cells to TTN also induced a marked stimulation of corticosteroid secretion, indicating that TTN acts directly on adrenocortical cells. The central-type benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) agonist, clonazepam, did not stimulate corticosteroid secretion and the CBR antagonist, flumazenil, did not block the stimulatory action of TTN. Similarly, the PBR agonist, Ro5-4864, did not mimic the stimulatory effect of TTN and the PBR antagonist, flunitrazepam, did not affect the stimulatory action of TTN. The present study provides the first evidence for a stimulatory effect of TTN on intact adrenocortical cells. The receptor mediating the corticotropic action of TTN is not related to central- or peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors. Our data suggest that TTN, released by chromaffin cells, may act as a paracrine factor regulating the activity of adrenocortical cells.", 
    "69": "Oxazepam (Serax) is a widely used benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent and a metabolite of other benzodiazepines such as Valium and Librium. Chronic feeding studies indicated that oxazepam is an hepatocarcinogen in B6C3F1 mice but did not increase hepatic tumors in F344 rats. The present study was performed to compare the hepatic responses of rats with our previous findings in mice to explore the reason(s) for the dramatic differences in tumor response between the two species. Male F344 rats (10 per dose-time group) received diets containing oxazepam at 0, 25, 125, 2500, and 5000 ppm. Hepatocyte labeling indices were measured immunohistochemically by PCNA and BrDU during the last 7 days before sacrifices after 15, 30, 45, and 90 days of dosing. Serum oxazepam was determined by reverse phase HPLC. Results indicated that oxazepam induced significant liver weight increases in a dose-related fashion by 15 days, which remained elevated for the entire study. No important clinical chemistry or pathology changes were noted except those related to hypertrophy. Cell proliferation was significantly increased in a dose-related manner by the 15- and 30-day timepoint in the 2500 and 5000 ppm groups. The most significant finding in the present study of oxazepam was plasma levels of the parent compound. Plasma levels in rats were dramatically lower than in B6C3F1 mice exposed to oxazepam in studies conducted earlier at the same dose levels. These results suggest that the early responses of rats and mice to oxazepam, such as cell proliferation and clinical chemistry parameters, are similar. Our previous studies demonstrated that oxazepam metabolites are excreted in the urine of rats, similar to humans, whereas mice excrete oxazepam metabolites in bile allowing enterohepatic recirculation, which results in high plasma levels of oxazepam. These data indicate that the rat excretes oxazepam kinetically (rate and route) similar to humans, but the mouse produces metabolites similar to humans.",

The following substances (effective doses, given IP) increased the number of rats feeding within 5 min in the center of the open field: meprobamate (30.0-300 mg/kg), 8-OH-DPAT (10 and 30 microg/kg), ipsapirone (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg), ritanserin (0.125-0.5 mg/kg), tropisetron (0.1-10.0 microg/kg), ondansetron (0.3-3.0 microg/kg), lisuride (0.28-0.55 mg/kg), morphine (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg), propranolol (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg), clozapine (1.0 mg/kg). Drugs without \"anxiolytic\" effects in other animal models or in humans, including amphetamine, apomorphine, haloperidol, sulpiride, and mCPP did not increase the incidence of food intake in this test. Ethanol and hexobarbital, in nonsedative doses, had no effect in this paradigm. Drugs and doses effective in the modified open-field test caused no increase in food intake in an independent food consumption test using food-deprived rats staying in the familiar cages. The results suggest that the modified open-field test can detect \"anxiolytic\" drug properties and is valid for the assessment of \"anxiolytic\" effects from different classes of drugs.", 
    "72": "This study investigates the influence of possible stress due to housing in Bolman cages on antinociception and on respiratory depression following opioid administration. To evaluate the functional role of this stressor and to modulate it, rats were subcutaneously pretreated with the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 10 mg/kg) or saline (SAL) before the immobilization in the Bolman cages and before the intravenous administration of small doses of morphine (MOR), sufentanil (SUF), or vehicle (VEH). Antinociception, respiratory impairment and stress were evaluated by means of the tail-flick latency, blood gas analysis, and serum corticosterone (CS), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and prolactin (PRL) determinations. The results demonstrated that 10 mg/kg CDP did not alter the antinociceptive effects of low doses of morphine and sufentanil. CDP pretreatment differentially affected the various blood gas parameters. Compared to vehicle pretreatment, there was a larger decrease in PaO2 following MOR and SUF in the CDP-pretreated rats. The effects were most pronounced at the lowest doses of both opioids. A CDP potentiation was also observed for the short-lasting raises in PaCO2 with the lowest concentrations of the opioids. At higher concentrations of the opioids, CDP was without any effect. With regard to the stress hormones, immobilization and an intravenous injection resulted in increases in CS and PRL in both CDP- and VEH-pretreated rats. ACTH did not change in these controls. SUF prevented the CS raises independent of a CDP pretreatment, while ACTH only increased in the SUF plus CDP groups, pointing to a stress-reducing effect of SUF. Also, MOR without CDP prevented the increases in CS, but the opioid intrinsically increased ACTH. These results indicate that restraint in Bolman cages in the present setup, with animals recovering for several hours in these cages after being equipped with an arterial catheter, is stressful but without any significant effect on the opioid-induced antinociception. Pretreatment with an anxiolytic benzodiazepine only minimally affected the outcome of the opioids on respiratory depression and pointed to a stress-reducing effect of low doses of the opioids, especially sufentanil.",

Novel antipsychotic agents introduce new pharmacological avenues that may differentially affect schizophrenic signs and symptoms, including depression.", 
    "76": "This was a 17-country investigation of 1996 patients with schizophrenia or a related diagnosis randomly assigned to a blinded, comparative trial of the novel antipsychotic agent olanzapine (5-20 mg/d) or the conventional D2 antagonist haloperidol (5-20 mg/d). Patients were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale. The trial consisted of a 6-week and a 46-week masked responder maintenance period.", 
    "77": "At least moderate depressive signs and symptoms (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score, > or =16) were seen in slightly more than half of this sample. Although both treatments were associated with short-term baseline-to-end point improvement on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, olanzapine-associated improvements were significantly superior to those observed with haloperidol (P=.001). Furthermore, the response rate for the group receiving olanzapine (> or =50% improvement on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale after at least 3 weeks of treatment) was also significantly higher (P=.008). Analysis demonstrated that improvement in positive, negative, and/or extrapyramidal symptoms was associated with mood improvement (indirect effect); however, most of the olanzapine treatment effect on mood was a primary direct effect (57%) that alone was significantly greater than that seen with haloperidol treatment (P<.001).", 
    "78": "Depressive signs and symptoms in schizophrenia are responsive to treatment. The pleotrophic pharmacological features of olanzapine, through 1 or more non-D2-mediated pathways, likely contribute to its superior treatment effect. Better control of the mood disorders accompanying schizophrenia holds the possibility for improved patient outcomes.", 
    "79": "The atypical antipsychotics are a new class of agents with great promise for use in the elderly because of their reduced propensity to cause acute extrapyramidal adverse effects. Treatment of older patients with these agents, however, needs to take into consideration age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and the risks of drug-drug interactions. Additionally, current evidence of their efficacy in late-life psychoses is derived largely from case series and from the extrapolation of results obtained in studies of younger patients with schizophrenia. Controlled clinical studies of atypical antipsychotics in elderly patients are urgently needed.", 
    "80": "Treatment options for epilepsy, especially using antiepileptic drugs, have increased substantially in the past five years. Since 1993, four novel antiepileptic drugs have been approved and marketed in the United States: felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate. Two others, tiagabine and vigabatrin, are likely to be approved in the near future. For many patients, these agents offer the realistic promise of improved seizure control, often with fewer adverse effects and less significant drug interactions compared with older agents. In addition, fosphenytoin, a water-soluble phenytoin prodrug with a number of advantages over intravenous phenytoin, has been released. There are new administration options for carbamazepine, diazepam, and valproic acid. For drug-resistant or -intolerant patients, there has been renewed interest in alternative therapies, especially the ketogenic diet. Taken together, these represent significant therapeutic advances that are benefiting patients with epilepsy. At the same time, improved understanding of the basic mechanisms of epileptogenesis, and of the cellular and molecular actions of available antiepileptic drugs, creates a framework for designing unique therapeutic strategies that are targeted at key sites of vulnerability involved in the development and maintenance of the epileptic state.", 
    "81": "A pregnant patient at 38 weeks' gestation developed symptoms of local anaesthetic toxicity following intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA) for hand surgery, using a standard dose of lignocaine. Reports suggest that a number of factors, both physiological and pharmacological, combine to increase the likelihood of local anaesthetic (LA) toxicity in pregnancy despite employment of a conventional \"safe\" IVRA technique. It is suggested that for IVRA, pregnant patients are premedicated with a benzodiazepine, the tourniquet time is increased and the concentration of LA is decreased to reduce the risks of LA toxicity.",

    "83": "The effects of intravenous administration of variable-dose midazolam (0, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg) and ketamine (3 mg/kg) were studied in twenty-four healthy unmedicated cats from time of administration until full recovery. End-points were chosen to determine the optimal dose to allow a short period of restraint without noxious stimuli, a short period of restraint with noxious stimuli and endotracheal intubation. Recovery characteristics, as well as undesirable behaviours observed during recovery, were also recorded. The dose of midazolam to achieve lateral recumbency with head down was found to be 0.016 mg/kg in 50% of the population (ED50) and 0.054 mg/kg in 95% (ED95) of the population. A midazolam dose of 0.286 mg/kg was required to prevent conscious perception of a stimulus to the ulnar nerve in 50% of the population and 0.652 mg/kg in 95% of the population. The ED50 and ED95 of midazolam required to prevent swallowing in response to a laryngoscope placed on the back of the tongue were found to be 0.265 mg/kg and 0.583 mg/kg, respectively. The ED50 doses of 0.265 mg/kg for intubation and 0.286 mg/kg for restraint with noxious stimulation were close to the tested dose of 0.3 mg/kg. At that dose, the lack of responses lasted 3.67 +/- 2.27 min for laryngoscope and 2.50 +/- 2.20 min for ulnar nerve stimulation, with recovery to walking with ataxia taking 41.50 +/- 15.18 min and complete recovery taking 3.6 +/- 1.3 h. The predominant behavioural pattern during recovery was found to be normal, but some cats also exhibited abnormal behavioural patterns. Nine of the twelve cats exhibited an abnormal arousal state, with 4 being restless and 5 being sedated. Seven of the twelve cats exhibited an abnormal behaviour when approached, with three of the cats being more difficult to approach and four of the cats being easier to approach. Eight of the twelve cats exhibited an abnormal behavioural pattern when restrained, with the cats equally divided between more difficult and easier to restrain. Five of the twelve cats vocalized more during the recovery. The ED50 of 0.042 mg/kg to induce chemical restraint without a noxious stimulus is close to the tested dose of 0.05 mg/kg. At that dose, cats remained lateral with head down for 5.49 +/- 4.02 min, took 25.96 +/- 5.77 min to walk with ataxia and 1.7 +/- 0.4 h for complete recovery. The predominant behavioural patterns during recovery were normal, with several cats exhibiting some abnormal patterns. Two cats were sedated, one cat was more difficult to approach, one cat was easier to restrain and three cats were more vocal.", 
    "84": "Experimental and clinical studies suggest that the central and peripheral benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors together with their ligands form the molecular basis of a novel regulatory network that contributes to the effects of anxiety on immune status. The peripheral-type receptors located on phagocytes and glial cells appear to play a key role in mediating the effects of endogenous and exogenous BDZs both on the defence mechanisms that protect the host against pathogens and on inflammatory reactions that take place within the periphery and the brain in response to injury. In addition, the central-type receptor, which forms part of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor complex, may contribute to the regulation of T-cell function by modulating the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis or the sympathoadrenal system or both, which, in turn, exert a significant effect on immune function. Thus, anxiogenic BDZs in general suppress the immune response, whereas anxiolytic BDZs may protect the individual from stress-induced immunosuppression.", 
    "85": "A 58-year-old woman developed slowly progressive tremulous myoclonus provoked mainly by action and posture. She had neither seizure nor dementia. No one in her family had similar symptoms. The presence of giant somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) with enhanced long loop reflex and premovement cortical spikes demonstrated by the jerk-locked averaging method suggest that the involuntary movement is cortical reflex myoclonus. Magnetoencephalogram revealed that the generator sources of giant SEPs were the post-central somatosensory cortex and probably also the pre-central motor cortex. Symptoms improved after treatment with zonisamide, clonazepam and valpolate. This kind of involuntary movement might be called cortical myoclonic tremor.",

I reviewed the developing hypnotic drugs in Japan. One benzodiazepine and 2 non-benzodiazepines. These hypnotics have selective affinity to benzodiazepine receptor omega 1 subtype. The half-life-time of the developing benzodiazepine hypnotic drug is long, therefore the rebound insomnia can not be recognized. Those of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics are short, namely 1-3 hours. The former drug has finished the clinical studies and waiting the permission for marketing from the government. The latter have still been under the clinical studies. We can expect these hypnotics will bring a certain advantages for our insomnia treatment in future.",

Therefore, it is most important that physicians establish the good relationship with patients and correctly diagnose and treat patients who have acute or transient sleep complaints. Physicians can improve patients' quality of life by evaluation of disease, supportive psychotherapy which include Morita therapy and behavior therapy, sleep hygine advice, and appropriate medications. In all patients, it is necessary for physicians to be aware of the physical, psychological and pharmacological factors, social aspects, and environmental factors of patients, because all these factors play an important role in appearance of sleep disorders.", 
    "89": "Drug-induced sleep disorders are classified into the following subtypes: a) insomnia, b) hypersomnia, c) pathological sleep d) others, those caused by medicine which can effect on circadian rhythm or sleep apnea. This paper described the relationship between several medical agents (neuroleptics, anti-depressants, anti-anxietics, anti-convulsants, psychostimulants, and drugs other than CNS-effective agents) and those effect on sleep and sleep stages. In the medicated patients, medical drugs are mainly responsible for their insomnia. However, it is sometimes difficult to find these drugs. The pathological sleep (i.e., delirium) are often developed following the drug-induced insomnia. Medication against insomnia (i.e., benzodiazepines) often exacerbates the pathological sleep. Therefore, common types of insomnia, drug-induced insomnia and pathological sleep should carefully be discriminated. Drug-induced rhythm-disorders and drug-induced sleep apnea remain to be studied. Future studies may clarify the effects of several drugs on these two disorders.",

Recent progresses in sleep medicine have identified some specific sleep syndromes such as sleep apnea syndrome, or nocturnal myoclonus syndrome. However, pathophysiological mechanism of sleep disorders associated with organic brain diseases have not been clarified.

RBD is caused symptomatically or idiopathically, and its manifestation of symptoms sometimes associated with psychosocial stress. Muscle tone is often augmented during impared REM sleep observed in RBD patients. Animal experimental studies suggest that dysfunction or lesions of muscle inhibitory system in brain stem is rerated with pathogenesis of RBD. Clonazepam is effective for organic behavior and nightmare, but not remarkable for dissociated REM sleep. Other benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants can be one of the choices of medications. Directions for safe-bedroom and psychotherapy is sometimes necessary.", 
    "92": "Arousal disorders, which belong to parasomnias in ICSD, have some disfunction in the process from sleep to awakenings. And the undesirable behaviors, such as wandering and screaming, are observed in the middle of awakening. Arousal disorders contain 1) confusional arousal, 2) sleepwalking, and 3) sleep terrors. Their common characteristics are the following items. 1) these symptoms frequently can be observable in infants, 2) these symptoms appear after awakenings especially from slow wave sleep, 3) the organic change has not been proven, 4) patients lose memory about the episode in the next morning, 5) natural improvement of symptoms can be expected after puberty. Confusional arousal is considered as a partial episode of sleepwalking and sleep terrors.",

In this article, clinical features, pathophysiological aspects, diagnoses and treatments for advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS) and delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS) are described. Although the pathophysiology or the etiology of ASPS and DSPS have not definitely been elucidated, the evidence that the chronobiological treatments sometimes improve patients with these disorders confirms the possibility that circadian rhythm sleep disorders are caused by dysfunction of biological clock. Further studies based on chronobiology or molecular biology are necessary to clarify the pathophysiology or the etiology of ASPS and DSPS and to develop the treatments against these circadian rhythm sleep disorders.",

Recently, the term \"nocturnal myoclonus\" has been replaced with PLM, because the movements are slower than true myoclonic movement. The appearance of PLM was reported in sleep apnea syndrome, delayed sleep phase syndrome, narcolepsy, spinal cord tumor, diabetes mellitus and uremia. The prevalence of PLM statistically increase with age. Patients with PLM show excessive daytime sleepiness or insomnia.

    "97": "Oral rapid acting nifedipine or verapamil was administered for 2 weeks (together with oral methadone in decreasing daily doses and specific symptomatic treatment, if appropriate), to patients with chronic dependence on various drugs of addiction. Several objective and subjective parameters were quantified to provide information about the patient's basic condition and progressive response to treatment, both before and after each CCB treatment. Patients also completed a daily questionnaire concerning their withdrawal intensity and provided a daily urine analysis.", 
    "98": "Both nifedipine and verapamil appeared to be safe and effective therapeutic adjuncts in the management of withdrawal and craving in 24 patients who successfully completed the trial. Although comparable in therapeutic efficacy in the doses used, verapamil produced far fewer and milder side effects than nifedipine. None of the verapamil side effects resulted in suspension or termination of treatment and it was the preferred agent, especially in patients presenting with a low blood pressure.", 
    "99": "In this pilot study nifedipine and verapamil appeared to be effective for the in-patient management of withdrawal and craving in a broad spectrum of chronic drug addicts. Verapamil produced fewer disturbing side effects compared with nifedipine and it may prove a safe, non-addicting and rational treatment in the long term management of chronic dependence, withdrawal and craving. As such, it may be especially valuable in offering the motivated chronic addict help and hope for the long term management of this problem in a community setting. The present results warrant the establishment of a verapamil based, double-blind, drug-matched or placebo-controlled clinical trial to test the validity and significance of these preliminary findings.", 
    "100": "Steroidogenic tissue can respond almost immediately to a stimulatory hormonal stimuli. Recent findings are shedding light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that are used to synthesize and export steroid hormones in the acute phase of stimulation. In addition to utilising the cAMP intracellular messenger system to convey a stimulatory message, steroidogenic cells may employ the protein kinase C, arachidonic acid, tyrosine phosphate and nitrous oxide systems. It has been proposed that cholesterol laden vesicles travel along a network of intermediate filaments to reach the mitochondria. Cholesterol may then translocate from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the inner via sites of contact between the two membranes. These contact sites may be composed of protein bridges which include the constituents, porin, the benzodiazepine receptor and GTP binding proteins. Cholesterol is transported through the contact sites to the inner membrane and on reaching cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc), cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is in turn converted to a range of steroid hormones via enzyme casades. GTP binding proteins may regulate the contact site between the inner and outer membranes and thereby modulate cholesterol flux to P450scc. In the adrenal and gonads the rate that cholesterol traverses the contact point to reach the inner membrane is accelerated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. Newly synthesized steroid hormones are transported to the cell periphery for export via a mechanism that may utilise an ion exchange protein.", 
    "101": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary disorder associated with the development of dyskinesias and dementia, characterised by profound atrophy of the striatum and, to a lesser extent, other brain areas. A relative gliosis has been described. One marker for such inflammatory gliosis is an elevation of peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites (PTBBS); these have also been shown to be increased following acute experimental and chronic degenerative neuronal damage. The present study investigates [3H]PK11195 binding to PTBBS in three brain areas of HD patients. We found a highly significant increase in PTBBS density in the putamen, a moderate but significant increase in the frontal cortex of HD patients and no significant change in the temporal cortex. Comparing these results to findings in other neurodegenerative diseases, e.g. Alzheimer's disease, where inflammation is discussed as a possible primary as well as a secondary pathological mechanism, our observations point to a possible involvement of inflammation in the neurodegenerative process in HD.",

    "103": "A series of tropinyl and piperidinyl esters was synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory activities on the endothelial muscarinic receptors of rat (M3) and rabbit (M2) aorta. Some of the esters (cyclohexylphenylglycolates and cyclohexylphenylpropionates) were found to be better antimuscarinic compounds than standard M2 and M3 inhibitors such as AFDX116 and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (DAMP), with pKEC50 values in the range of 8-9. A few esters were found to be more selective M3 than M2 inhibitors, but these tended to have low activities. The hydrophobic, electronic and steric characteristics of these esters were correlated with antimuscarinic activity by using appropriate parameters representing hydrophobicity (HPLC capacity factor, log kw), size (molecular volume) and electronic character (Taft's polar substituent constant sigma * and 13C chemical shift difference delta delta). Finally, 92% of the M2-inhibitory activities of the esters could be accounted for by the size and electronic character sigma * of the side chain. In contrast, the M3-inhibitory activities of these esters were mainly attributed to the electronic nature (sigma *, delta delta) of the side chain, with good activity being associated with electron-withdrawing groups. Visualization of the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) steric and electrostatic fields provided further confirmation of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) derived from traditional quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) approaches.",

After a placebo run-in phase of 1 week, they received active treatment for 4 weeks. Psychometric evaluations included 6 thymopsychic variables (somatic complaints, state anxiety, trait anxiety, self-rating anxiety and depression scale and adjective mood scale), 6 noopsychic variables (general, associative, numerical and total verbal memory; correct reproductions and errors-Benton visual memory test), 4 pupillary measures (pupillary diameter, latency, relative change in % and half recovery time in pupillary response) and 6 skin conductance measures (baseline, latency, ascending time, time to peak, skin conductance response and skin conductance response maximum). Multivariate statistical analysis of the thymopsyche demonstrated significant improvement after both compounds, with the combination drug significantly superior to its single component lorazepam. Also regarding noopsychic measures, Somnium was significantly superior to the single component lorazepam, as specifically verbal memory was improved after Somnium, while opposite changes occurred after lorazepam alone. Pupillary measures revealed no significant overall inter-drug differences, whereas skin conductance findings demonstrated that the combination drug Somnium was superior to the single component lorazepam also in regard to the anxiolytic effect at the autonomic nervous system level.",

Depressed patients with psychotic disorders frequently require treatment with concomitant antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. Imipramine pharmacokinetics serve as a marker for hepatic CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP3A activity. An open-label, three-way randomized crossover study was done to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and potential for a drug interaction between olanzapine (5 mg) and imipramine (75 mg). Each drug was administered alone and in combination. Nine healthy men, ages 32 to 54 years, enrolled in the study. Psychomotor performance capacities, plasma olanzapine, imipramine, desipramine concentrations, and clinical laboratory tests were measured. Pharmacokinetic variables, vital signs, subjective tests for liveliness, and psychomotor outcomes were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. Olanzapine was safe. Sedation, postural hypotension, and minor vital sign alterations occurred during all treatments. On the liveliness questionnaire, patients generally reported poorer (less lively) scores with olanzapine alone or coadministered with imipramine versus baseline scores. These effects disappeared within 24 hours after administration. Olanzapine alone and in combination decreased motor-speed tasks (finger tapping and visual-arm random reach) compared with baseline or imipramine treatment. Peak 6-hour changes were statistically significant but clinical importance was only marginal. Olanzapine concentrations were < 19% greater than with imipramine. But olanzapine did not affect the kinetics of imipramine or desipramine and, therefore, did not show a metabolic drug interaction involving CYP2D6.",

At that time, zopiclone had shown hypnotic efficacy superior to that of placebo, but had not been extensively compared with benzodiazepine hypnotics in patients with insomnia. A much larger body of clinical data is now available, allowing a more detailed evaluation than was previously possible. Together with results from earlier studies, subsequent clinical trials have shown that zopiclone is generally at least as effective as the benzodiazepines (regardless of duration of action) in the treatment of insomnia, although comparisons between zopiclone and flurazepam have produced inconsistent results. Tolerance to the effects of zopiclone was not seen in short term clinical trials (< or = 4 weeks); data from longer term studies are conflicting and the potential for tolerance during long term zopiclone treatment is therefore unclear. Zopiclone has a relatively low propensity to cause residual clinical effects (such as difficulty in waking or reduced morning concentration). Rebound of insomnia to a level below that at baseline can occur after withdrawal of zopiclone, but, on the basis of data from short term studies, does not appear to be common. Data from prescription-event monitoring suggest that zopiclone does not have a high dependence potential (at least in those who are not regular drug abusers/addicts). Zopiclone is well tolerated in both the elderly and younger patients with insomnia. A bitter aftertaste is usually the most common adverse event, but is relatively infrequent (3.6% in the largest available postmarketing study). Thus, zopiclone is now firmly established as an effective and well tolerated hypnotic agent. Although the available data on rebound insomnia and dependence liability are encouraging, potential differences between zopiclone and the benzodiazepines in these respects may have little clinical relevance in the context of short term intermittent use of hypnotics, as it currently recommended. A low propensity for rebound insomnia and dependence might prove valuable during long term hypnotic therapy (which, although not recommended, is a clinical reality). However, the risk-benefit profile of zopiclone in this context remains unknown. Nevertheless, zopiclone is clearly a suitable alternative to the benzodiazepines for the short term treatment of insomnia.", 
    "112": "The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in modulating feed intake depression in parasite-infected lambs was investigated using CCK receptor antagonists (L364-718 and loxiglumide). Four experiments were carried out using ewe lambs infected with 4000 Trichostrongylus colubriformis larvae/d or non-infected controls (n8, live weight 25 kg). Animals were fed daily on a nutritionally complete pelleted diet and had free access to water. In the first experiment, infected and non-infected animals were injected subcutaneously with CCK antagonist (100 micrograms L364-718) or carrier alone as a single dose. In the second experiment, CCK antagonist (loxiglumide: 0, 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg live weight) was injected into a jugular vein immediately before feeding. In the third experiment, animals were infused continuously with the CCK antagonist (loxiglumide; 10 mg/kg per h) for 10 min before feeding and for the first 2 h of feeding. In the final experiment, lambs were fitted with an indwelling cerebral ventricular cannula and infused with a CCK antagonist (loxiglumide, 162 micrograms/min), CCK agonist (CCK-8, 2.5 pmol/min), loxiglumide plus CCK-8 or sterile saline solution alone via the cannula for 30 min before feeding and for the first 60 min of feeding. In all the experiments short-term feed intake was recorded at 10 and 15 min intervals for the first and second hours of feeding respectively, then at hourly intervals for the remainder of the 8 h recording period. Peripheral injection with L364-718 or loxiglumide did not elevate feed intake in either the infected or non-infected animals. However, feed intake was increased (P < 0.05) in the short term by central infusion of loxiglumide, this effect being greater in the infected animals and apparently due to an elevation in intake during the second hour of feeding. CCK-8 depressed short term feed intake only in the infected animals (P < 0.05). Total daily feed consumption was not influenced by any of the pharmacological agents. The results indicate an involvement of central CCK receptors in regulation of feed intake depression following gastrointestinal parasitism of sheep and the possibility of a similar role in non-infected sheep. They do not support the singular importance of a peripheral action of CCK in determining satiety.", 
    "113": "We conducted a two-part controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of preoperative oral pirenzepine (muscarinic receptor antagonist known to inhibit gastric secretion), ranitidine, and the combination pirenzepine-ranitidine in controlling gastric fluid pH and volume in 210 ASA I children, aged 2-14 yr, undergoing elective surgery. In the first part of the study (n = 90), the proportion of children considered at risk for aspiration pneumonitis was reduced with pirenzepine 25 mg (P < 0.05) but not with 12.5 mg. In the second part of the study, the other 120 children were allocated randomly to one of four groups: pirenzepine 25 mg with placebo; ranitidine 75 mg with placebo; pirenzepine 25 mg with ranitidine 75 mg; and placebo and placebo. These medications were administered 1 h before anaesthesia. After tracheal intubation, volume and pH of the gastric fluid aspiration via a multiorifice orogastric tube were measured. Pirenzepine 25 mg decreased gastric fluid volume (P < 0.05) but failed to increase gastric pH. Ranitidine 75 mg increased gastric pH (P < 0.05) but failed to decrease fluid volume. The pirenzepine-ranitidine combination reduced gastric fluid acidity and volume (P < 0.05).", 
    "114": "Among glutamate receptor subtypes, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor plays a key role in brain development and cognitive processes, and mediates excitotoxic injury. To test the hypothesis that prolonged seizures may affect NMDA receptor characteristics in the developing brain, a 30-min episode of generalized seizures was induced in rats at 5, 10, 15 and 25 d of age by i.p. administrations of bicuculline, NMDA receptors were analyzed using specific binding of [3H]-labeled (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a,d]-cycloheptene-5,10-imin e maleate (MK-801) in brain membrane preparations, and allosteric regulation was studied by addition of glutamate (10 microM) and glycine (10 microM). In control pups, total number of binding sites increased between 5 and 25 d, Bmax values varying from 1032 +/- 93 to 2311 +/- 449 fmol/mg protein, whereas receptor affinity decreased with age, the affinity constant (Kd) changing from 20.9 +/- 2.0 to 29.1 +/- 2.0 nM. Activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate and glycine led to age-dependent decreases in Kd values, from 30% at 5 d to 72% at 25 d. Seizures altered receptor density only at 5 d (by 40%). Receptor affinity was increased after seizures at 5, 15 and 25 d (from 12 to 60%). The capacity of receptor activation by glutamate and glycine was significantly reduced by seizures at 5 d. There was no change either in density nor affinity of receptors at 10 d. Therefore, as previously shown for central adenosine and benzodiazepine receptors, sustained seizures are able to alter the characteristics of NMDA receptors in a specific way depending on the maturational stage, suggesting developmental changes in the mechanisms of brain response to seizures."
