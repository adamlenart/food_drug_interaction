With introduction of LC-MS/MS, not only DBS could be used to analysis drugs in small blood volume, but in various fields, such as toxicology, drug therapeutic monitoring, drug diagnostic screening, and illicit drugs. In toxicology field, many drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines, acetaminophen, small molecule drugs) have been tested with DBS. Compared with earlier blood extraction methods (SPE and LLE), DBS has lots of advantages; lower blood volume (less than 50\u03bcL), shorter analysis time caused by a more concise analysis procedure and lower cost. We optimized the DBS procedure and LC-MS/MS conditions for 18 benzodiazepines, seven benzodiazepine metabolites, and one z-drug (zolpidem) analysis in blood. 30\u03bcL of whole blood was spotted on FTA DMPK card C and dried for 2h in a desiccator. A 6-mm disk was punched and vortexed for 1min in a centrifuge tube with 300\u03bcL methanol/acetonitrile mixture (1:1, v/v). After evaporation, redissolved in 100\u03bcL mobile phase of LC-MS/MS and 5\u03bcL was injected. In the analysis for 26 target compounds in blood, all of the method validation parameters - LLOD, LLOQ, accuracy (intra- and inter-assay), and precision (intra- and inter-assay) - were satisfied with method validation criteria, within 15%. The results of matrix effect, recovery, and process efficiency were good. We developed a fast and reliable sample preparation method using DBS for 26 benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine metabolites, and z-drug (zolpidem).", 
    "1": "Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) are cell surface integral proteins that mediate the fast neurotransmission in the nervous system. LGICs require auxiliary subunits for their trafficking, assembly and pharmacological modulation. Auxiliary subunits do not form functional homomeric receptors, but are reported to assemble with the principal subunits in order to modulate their pharmacological profiles. For example, nACh receptors are built at least by co-assemble of \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, and the neuronal auxiliary subunits \u03b23 and \u03b15 and muscle type \u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b3, and \u03f5 determine the agonist affinity of these receptors. Serotonergic 5-HT3B, 5-HT3C, 5-HT3D and 5-HT3E are reported to assemble with the 5-HT3A subunit to modulate its pharmacological profile. Functional studies evaluating the role of \u03b32 and \u03b4 auxiliary subunits of GABAA receptors have made important advances in the understanding of the action of benzodiazepines, ethanol and neurosteroids. Glycine receptors are composed principally by \u03b11-3 subunits and the auxiliary subunit \u03b2 determines their synaptic location and their pharmacological response to propofol and ethanol. NMDA receptors appear to be functional as heterotetrameric channels. So far, the existence of NMDA auxiliary subunits is controversial. On the other hand, Kainate receptors are modulated by NETO 1 and 2. AMPA receptors are modulated by TARPs, Shisa 9, CKAMP44, CNIH2-3 auxiliary proteins reported that controls their trafficking, conductance and gating of channels. P2X receptors are able to associate with auxiliary Pannexin-1 protein to modulate P2X7 receptors. Considering the pharmacological relevance of different LGICs auxiliary subunits in the present work we will highlight the therapeutic potential of these modulator proteins.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor and are prescribed as anxiolytics, hypnotics, and anticonvulsants. While these drugs clearly have clinical value, their use is associated with unwanted side effects such as sedation and motor impairment. Neuroactive steroids are endogenous modulators of GABAA receptors and recent evidence has shown that combinations of the triazolo-benzodiazepine triazolam and the endogenous neuroactive steroid pregnanolone can produce both supra-additive anxiolytic effects and infra-additive reinforcing effects. In the present study, we investigated these same combinations as well as combinations of two clinically-relevant drugs from different chemical classes, the 1, 4 substituted (7-nitro) benzodiazepine clonazepam and the synthetic neuroactive steroid ganaxolone, in rats trained under a 10-response, fixed ratio (FR) schedule of food reinforcement. All four drugs induced a significant and dose-dependent suppression of food-maintained responding. From the dose-response functions, ED50s (i.e., the doses that engendered 50% of the maximum rate-decreasing effect) were generated for each drug. Dose-response functions for combinations of triazolam/pregnanolone, clonazepam/ganaxolone, triazolam/ganaxolone, and clonazepam/pregnanolone were then determined. Isobolographic analysis of the rate-decreasing effects of these combinations revealed that the potencies of the triazolam/pregnanolone combinations were supra-additive while the clonazepam/ganaxolone combinations were additive or infra-additive in relation to predicted values based on dose-additive effects. Furthermore, mixtures of clonazepam/pregnanolone were supra-additive while triazolam/ganaxolone combinations were additive, infra-additive and supra-additive. These results suggest that the ability of benzodiazepine and neuroactive steroid combinations to attenuate rates of food-maintained responding depends critically on both the constituent drugs and the dose of drug in the mixtures.", 
    "3": "The present study examined the effects of antipsychotic drugs on the expression of synapse-associated proteins in the frontal cortex of rats with and without immobilization stress. Rats were subjected to immobilization stress 6h/day for 3 weeks. The effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs, olanzapine and aripiprazole, on expression of serine(9)-phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2, \u03b2-catenin, BDNF, PSD-95, and synaptophysin were determined by Western blotting. A typical antipsychotic drug, haloperidol, was used for comparison. Immobilization stress significantly decreased the expression of these proteins in the frontal cortex. Chronic administration of olanzapine and aripiprazole significantly attenuated the immobilization stress-induced decrease in the levels of these proteins, whereas haloperidol had no such effect. Additionally, olanzapine and aripiprazole significantly increased levels of phosphorylated GSK-3\u03b2 under normal conditions without stress, and aripiprazole also increased BDNF levels under this condition. These results indicate that olanzapine and aripiprazole, and, haloperidol, differentially regulate the levels of synapse-associated proteins in the rat frontal cortex. These findings may contribute to explain the neurobiological basis of how olanzapine and aripiprazole up-regulated synapse-associated proteins.",

In Scotland it has been detected in a large number of post mortem cases, but very little data has been published looking at post mortem concentrations of this drug and indeed concentrations that may be associated with causing death. We looked at all post mortem cases between 2010 and 2014 where phenazepam was found in blood and correlated these with the given cause of death. The data collected shows the variability in reporting of phenazepam deaths and will provide a useful tool for those deciding when phenazepam should or should not be included as a cause of death. Cases discussed include drug related deaths with phenazepam as the sole cause of death (as is), drug related death when the cause of death was noted as being from a combination of phenazepam plus one or more other drugs (range <0.005-0.9mg/L, median 0.10mg/L) and causes of death in non-drug related deaths where phenazepam was detected (hangings range <0.05-0.39mg/L, median 0.09mg/L and deaths due to ischaemic heart disease range 0.05-0.1mg/L, median 0.04mg/L).",

Grey matter volumes were lower in bilateral inferior frontal, orbitofrontal, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) and left superior medial gyri (t = 3.0, p<0.005uncorr). In ROI analyses, there were no volume differences in the middle occipital gyrus (region of V5/MT) or parietal operculum 2 (region of the parietoinsular vestibular cortex). Illness duration was positively related to grey matter volume in bilateral inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula (IFG/AI), right posterior insula, superior parietal lobule, left middle occipital gyrus (V5/MT), bilateral postcentral gyrus, anterior cerebellum, and left cerebellar hemisphere and vermian lobule IX. In contrast, illness duration was negatively related to volume in pgACC, posterior middle cingulate gyrus (MCC), left middle frontal gyrus (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-DLPFC), and right cerebellar hemispheric lobule VIIIb (t = 3.0, p<0.005uncorr). The most significant differences were decreased volume in the pgACC and increased volume in the left IFG/AI with longer illness duration (qFDRcorr <0.05). Concurrent medication use did not correlate with these findings or have a relationship with duration of illness. MdDS participants showed positive correlations between grey matter volume in pgACC and bilateral cerebellar lobules VIII/IX, which was not seen in controls.",

The aim of this study was to assess the energetics of a drug that was bound to human serum albumin (HSA) during thermal denaturation. Drugs that were bound at a single high-affinity primary binding site on HSA, including diazepam and ibuprofen, were employed. Commercial HSA was treated with charcoal to remove stabilizers and adjusted to 20% w/v in a pH 7.4 buffered solution. Serial concentrations of individual drugs up to 0.16 mmole/g-protein were added to the cleaned HSA solutions whereas diazepam was added to a commercial HSA solution. Samples were subjected to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) set to run from 37 to 90\u00b0C at 3.0\u00b0C/min. Binding of the drug slightly increased the denaturing temperature of the cleaned HSA due to a shift in the equilibrium toward the native protein bound with the drug. Diazepam depressed the denaturing temperature of the commercial HSA by competing with the stabilizers already bound to the primary site of the HSA. This yielded not only the HSA-stabilizer but also the HSA-diazepam type complexes that exhibited a different denaturation process. A rational approximation of the Lumry-Eyring protein denaturation model was used to treat the DSC endotherms. The approximated scheme: [Formula: see text] was successfully fitted to the data.

Our objective was to examine trends of office/outpatient department visits with a mention of a benzodiazepine made by patients aged \u226540 years with COPD in the United States. We used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1999-2010. From 1999 to 2010, the estimated numbers of office/outpatient department visits with a benzodiazepine mentioned increased from 20.7 million to 43.2 million among all patients, from 684,000 to 1.5 million among patients with COPD, and from 20.0 million to 41.7 million among patients without COPD. Using all 12-years of data, patients with COPD were more likely to have a visit with a mention of a benzodiazepine than patients without COPD (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.27-1.71).The unadjusted percentage of all office/outpatient department visits by patients with COPD with a mention of a benzodiazepine increased from 4.6% during 1999-2002 to 10.2% during 2007-2010 (P trend < 0.001). After adjustment for age, sex, and race, the adjusted prevalence ratio for 2007-2010 compared with 1999-2002 was 2.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.60-3.17).

High quality of induction of anaesthesia with propofol has been well described while in contrast variable induction and recovery quality has been associated with diazepam-ketamine. In this study, anaesthetic induction and recovery characteristics of diazepam-ketamine combination with propofol alone were compared in dogs undergoing elective orchidectomy. Thirty-six healthy adult male dogs were used. After habitus scoring (simple descriptive scale [SDS]), the dogs were sedated with morphine and acepromazine. Forty minutes later a premedication score (SDS) was allocated and general anaesthesia was induced using a combination of diazepam-ketamine (Group D/K) or propofol (Group P) and maintained with isoflurane. Scores for the quality of induction, intubation and degree of myoclonus were allocated (SDS). Orchidectomy was performed after which recovery from anaesthesia was scored (SDS) and times to extubation and standing were recorded. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and Kappa Reliability and Kendall Tau B tests. Both groups were associated with acceptable quality of induction and recovery from anaesthesia. Group P, however, was associated with a poorer quality of induction (p = 0.014), prolonged induction period (p = 0.0018) and more pronounced myoclonus (p = 0.003), but had better quality of recovery (p = 0.000002) and shorter recovery times (p = 0.035) compared with Group D/K. Diazepam-ketamine and propofol are associated with acceptable induction and recovery from anaesthesia. Propofol had inferior anaesthetic induction characteristics, but superior and quicker recovery from anaesthesia compared with diazepam-ketamine.",

Her delirium-like symptoms, including insomnia, visual hallucinations, and a long-term memory deficit, disappeared after cessation of oseltamivir and administration of benzodiazepine. Detailed assessment was performed, including neurological examination (electroencephalogram, brain magnetic resonance imaging, single photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer and with (123)I-iomazenil, cerebrospinal fluid analysis and glutamate receptor autoantibodies), drug level determination and simulation, and genetic assessment (OAT1, OAT3, CES1, Neu2).",

Thus, abnormal exposure to Ro 64-0802 might have contributed, at least in part, to the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms in this patient. The score on Naranjo's adverse drug reaction probability scale was 6.

This study was designed to identify factors contributing to TRD in patients diagnosed with a major depressive disorder. Patients were grouped into \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" treatment-resistant (TR) groups based on the number of medications that had been prescribed for their depression. We identified a number of factors linked to TRD. The high TR group was generally older, had a longer depressive episode duration, a higher number of comorbid medical and anxiety disorders, a lower education, and were less likely to be in full-time employment. They also reported less trait irritability and were more likely to view medication as being a contributor to their current depression. Some differences between non-melancholic and melancholic subsets were evident and point to the benefits in research on TRD analyzing the two diagnostic groups separately. The most striking finding was benzodiazepine use, which was significantly more common in the high TR group and within both the melancholic and non-melancholic subsets. Some potential explanations for this finding are offered.", 
    "66": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterized by severe hypophagia and weight loss, and an intense fear of weight gain. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) refers to the weight loss, hypophagia and paradoxical hyperactivity that develops in rodents exposed to running wheels and restricted food access, and provides a model for aspects of AN. The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was recently shown to reduce both AN symptoms and ABA. We examined which component of the complex pharmacological profile of olanzapine reduces ABA. Mice received 5-HT(2A/2C), 5-HT3, dopamine D1-like, D2, D3 or D2/3 antagonist treatment, and were assessed for food intake, body weight, wheel running and survival in ABA. D2/3 receptor antagonists eticlopride and amisulpride reduced weight loss and hypophagia, and increased survival during ABA. Furthermore, amisulpride produced larger reductions in weight loss and hypophagia than olanzapine. Treatment with either D3 receptor antagonist SB277011A or D2 receptor antagonist L-741,626 also increased survival. All the other treatments either had no effect or worsened ABA. Overall, selective antagonism of D2 and/or D3 receptors robustly reduces ABA. Studies investigating the mechanisms by which D2 and/or D3 receptors regulate ABA, and the efficacy for D2/3 and/or D3 antagonists to treat AN, are warranted.",

However, EPM apparatuses and their features can differ among laboratories, most notably in the presence/absence of ledges on the open arm and/or the transparency/opaqueness of walls on the closed arm. The combined effects of these variable arm features on EPM behavior are not yet fully understood. In the present study, we prepared four types of EPM apparatus - open arms with (0.5 cm) or without (0 cm) ledges\u00d7closed arms with transparent or opaque walls - and compared the maze-exploration behavior of male Sprague-Dawley rats. We found that the presence of open arm ledges significantly increased the incidence of open arm exploration. Furthermore, time spent in the distal segment of the open arm was shortest in the apparatus that had open arms with no ledges and opaque closed arms (No-Ledges/Opaque), and was longest in the apparatus that had open arms with ledges and transparent closed arms (Ledges/Transparent). Additionally, the No-Ledges/Opaque apparatus could detect the effect of 0.5mg/kg diazepam, an anxiolytic drug, whereas the Ledges/Transparent apparatus could not. These results indicate that arm structure (features of both open and closed arms) significantly influences maze-exploratory behavior in rats, and that No-Ledges/Opaque apparatuses have higher detection sensitivity for anxiolytic effects of diazepam than that of Ledges/Transparent apparatuses.", 
    "74": "The heavy consumption of ethanol can lead to alcohol use disorders (AUDs) which impact patients, their families, and societies. Yet the genetic and physiological factors that predispose humans to AUDs remain unclear. One hypothesis is that alterations in mitochondrial function modulate neuronal sensitivity to ethanol exposure. Using Drosophila genetics we report that inactivation of the mitochondrial outer membrane translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO), also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, affects ethanol sedation and tolerance in male flies. Knockdown of dTSPO in adult male neurons results in increased sensitivity to ethanol sedation, and this effect requires the dTSPO depletion-mediated increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inhibition of caspase activity in fly heads. Systemic loss of dTSPO in male flies blocks the development of tolerance to repeated ethanol exposures, an effect that is not seen when dTSPO is only inactivated in neurons. Female flies are naturally more sensitive to ethanol than males, and female fly heads have strikingly lower levels of dTSPO mRNA than males. Hence, mitochondrial TSPO function plays an important role in ethanol sensitivity and tolerance. Since a large array of benzodiazepine analogues have been developed that interact with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, the mitochondrial TSPO might provide an important new target for treating AUDs.", 
    "75": "There has been growing clinical, public, and media awareness and concern about the availability and potential harmfulness of so-called 'legal highs', which are more appropriately called new or novel psychoactive substances (NPS). A cat-and-mouse process has emerged wherein unknown chemists and laboratories are producing new, and as yet nonproscribed, compounds for human consumption; and as soon as they are banned, which they inevitably are, slightly modified analogues are produced to circumvent new laws. This rapidly changing environment, 81 new substances were identified in 2013 alone, has led to confusion for clinicians, psychopharmacologists, and the public at large. Our difficulties in keeping up with the process has had a two-fold negative effect: the danger of ignoring what is confusing; and the problem that some of the newer synthesized compounds appear ever more potent. This review aims to circumscribe a quick moving and growing field, and to categorize NPS into five major groups based upon their 'parent' compounds: stimulants similar to cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy; cannabinoids; benzodiazepine based drugs; dissociatives similar to ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP); and those modelled after classic hallucinogens such as LSD and psilocybin. Pharmacodynamic actions, subjective and physical effects, harmfulness, risk of dependency and, where appropriate, putative clinical potentials are described for each class. Clinicians might encounter NPS in various ways: anecdotal reportage; acute intoxication; as part of a substance misuse profile; and as a precipitant or perpetuating factor for longer-term physical and psychological ill health. Current data are overall limited, and much of our knowledge and treatment strategies are based upon those of the 'parent' compound. There is a critical need for more research in this field, and for professionals to make themselves more aware of this growing issue and how it might affect those we see clinically and try to help: a brave new world of so-called 'psychonauts' consuming NPS will also need informed 'psychotherapeutonauts'. The paper should serve as a primer for clinicians and interested readers, as well as provide a framework into which to place the new substances that will inevitably be synthesized in the future.",

Of non-opioid medications associated with the prescription opiate deaths, benzodiazepines were the most frequently encountered (68.4%), and alprazolam (35.1%) was most common. Though prescribers have no control over drug diversion they should be cognizant of the urgent public health concern regarding prescription opioid abuse and associated fatalities and attempt to identify doctor shoppers and limit prescription of these potent drugs to those with a legitimate need for pain control.

    "96": "Preclinical studies indicate that the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine is dependent on activation of AMPA receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) resulting in a prolonged enhancement of glutamatergic transmission in the mPFC. In similarity, addition of atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) to SSRIs has also been found to induce a rapid and potent antidepressant effect. Using intracellular recordings in layer V/VI pyramidal cells of the rat mPFC in vitro, we found that a combination of low, clinically relevant concentrations of the atypical APD olanzapine and the SSRI fluoxetine facilitated NMDA and AMPA-induced currents in pyramidal cells via activation of dopamine D1 receptors. A single ketamine injection (10mg/kg, 24h before the experiment) enhanced AMPA-and apparently to some extent also NMDA-induced currents. Our results propose that the rapid and potent antidepressant effects of both treatments may be related to a common mechanism of action, namely facilitation of glutamatergic, in particular AMPA receptor-mediated transmission, in the mPFC.",

We also examined the effects of intracortical microinjection of diazepam (a GABA-benzodiazepine receptor agonist) and flumazenil (a GABAbenzodiazepine receptor antagonist) to clarify the possible mechanism of vitamin B12. In urethane-anesthetized rats, epileptiform activity was induced by intracortical microinjection of penicillin (300 IU, 1.5 microL), and the number and amplitude of spike waves were analyzed using electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Intracortical microinjections of vitamin B12 at doses of 100 and 200 ng/site, diazepam at a dose of 200 ng/site and their ineffective doses (50 ng/site of vitamin B12 with 50 ng/site of diazepam) co-microinjection treatment significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced both the number and amplitude of spike waves. In addition, combined microinjection of effective doses of vitamin B12 (100 ng/site) and diazepam (200 ng/site) produced more antiepileptiform effect in comparison with their alone used doses. The antiepileptic effects induced by microinjection of vitamin B12 and diazepam at a same dose of 200 ng/site were prevented by the same site microinjection of 50 ng/site of flumazenil. The results showed antiepileptiform activities for vitamin B12 and diazepam AT the cerebral cortex level.

The aim of the study was to assess the influence of duration of zolpidem treatment and its withdrawal, as well as the role of alpha1-containing GABAA receptors in the development of physical dependence and tolerance. Namely, recombinant receptors can be used to characterize mechanisms involved in different processes in the brain and to delineate the contribution of specific receptor subtypes. To address the influence of chronic zolpidem treatment we exposed HEK293 cells stably expressing alpha1beta2gamma2S recombinant GABAA receptors for seven consecutive days, while withdrawal periods lasted for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Using radioligand binding studies we determined that chronic zolpidem treatment did not induce changes in either GABAA receptor number or in the expression of subunit mRNAs. We observed the enhancement of binding sites and upregulated expression of subunit mRNAs only following 96-hour withdrawal. Moreover, zolpidem treatment and its withdrawal (All time points) induced functional uncoupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites in the GABAA receptor complex. Accordingly, it might be assumed that zolpidem withdrawal-induced uncoupling of GABAA receptors is associated with altered GABAA receptor subunit mRNA expression. The results presented here provide an insight into molecular and cellular mechanisms probably underlying adaptive changes of GABAA receptor function in response to chronic usage and withdrawal of zolpidem and perhaps the observed molecular changes could be linked to the tolerance and dependence produced upon prolonged treatment with other GABAergic drugs.",

Carbon monoxide (CO), when bound to red blood cells (CO-RBC) has the potential to protect the hepatic CYP protein to produce a resuscitative effect in a hemorrhagic shock rat model. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which CO-RBC resuscitation from a massive hemorrhage protects against a decrease in hepatic CYP. In the early phase (\u223c1h) after a hemorrhage and RBC resuscitation, hepatic CYP protein levels were significantly decreased with increasing hepatic free heme levels, but were maintained by a pre-treatment of gadolinium chloride (GdCl3), a Kupffer cell inhibitor, and Trolox, an anti-oxidant agent, as well as CO-RBC resuscitation. Under these conditions, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from activated Kupffer cells was increased, but this increase was suppressed by CO-RBC resuscitation. At a late phase (6\u223c24h), CYP mRNA levels decreased after hemorrhage and RBC resuscitation, but not in the case of CO-RBC resuscitation. The increases in plasma IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were decreased by CO-RBC resuscitation via the suppression of the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) and the expression of the high mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1). Hepatic CYP protection after a hemorrhage and CO-RBC resuscitation can be attributed to the inactivation of Kupffer cells, resulting in the suppression of ROS production in the early phase and the suppression of inflammatory cytokine production via the TLR-4/HMGB-1signal pathway in the late phase.",

    "101": "This article: (1) briefly reviews NAS history, including initial identification, assessment, and treatment efforts; (2) summarizes the current status of and current issues surrounding recent NAS assessment and treatment, and (3) details future directions in NAS conceptualization, measurement, and treatment.", 
    "102": "Mortality rate estimates in neonates treated for NAS exceeded 33%, and surpassed 90% for un-treated infants during the late-1800s until the mid-1900s. The focus of both assessment and treatment over the past 50years is predominantly due to two forces. First, methadone pharmacotherapy for \"heroin addiction\" led to women in methadone maintenance programs who were, or became pregnant. The second was defining NAS and developing a measure of neonatal withdrawal, the Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System (NASS). Various NAS treatment protocols were based on the NASS as well as other NAS measures.", 
    "103": "Future research must focus on psychometrically sound screening and assessment measures of neonatal opioid withdrawal for premature, term and older infants, measuring and treating possible withdrawal from non-opioids, particularly benzodiazepines, integrated non-pharmacological treatment of NAS, weight-based versus symptom-based treatment of NAS, and second-line treatment for NAS.", 
    "104": "Due to the lack of certified reference material, a reliable quantification in complex postmortem matrices can only be performed either by the addition of isotope-labelled standards or by the standard addition method. Although standard addition is a basic quantification procedure, its practical implementation is challenging, and a highly reproducible extraction method is essential. Therefore, an automated solid-phase extraction screening procedure was validated in respect to the specific requirements in postmortem analyses, using pig brain fortified with nine compounds to represent a realistic postmortem setting. The validation parameters linearity, repeatability, reproducibility and recovery were selected to test the method's 'fitness for purpose'. All obtained results were satisfying, although the method was not optimized for the selected compounds. Therefore, this validated method could be used for further standard addition experiments to evaluate the importance of the initial estimated concentration for the calculation of concentrations to set up the calibration curve. We could show that the best results were obtained when the estimated concentration was close to the real concentration. In case of a deviation, an underestimation is more favorable than an overestimation.",

IDU was assessed by indicators developed by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare. Hospitalizations and mortality data were collected from Swedish registers. Regression models were used to investigate associations between IDU, hospitalizations, and mortality in the whole population and in the subpopulation of persons with dementia (n = 319), after adjustment for sociodemographics, physical functioning, and co-morbidity. Costs for hospitalizations were derived from the Nord-Diagnose Related Group cost database.",

There was also a tendency for higher costs for hospitalizations with IDU than without IDU, although this was not statistically significant.", 
    "108": "Our findings suggest that IDU is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization in older persons and in persons with dementia. IDU is also associated with mortality among older persons. These findings highlight the need for cautious prescribing of long-acting benzodiazepines, anticholinergic drugs, concurrent use of three or more psychotropic drugs and drug combinations that may lead to serious drug-drug interactions to older patients. Further studies are needed to investigate the association between IDU and costs for hospitalizations.", 
    "109": "We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of intramuscular (IM)-olanzapine (OLA-IM) versus controls in agitated patients. The risk ratio, number-needed-to-treat/harm, and standardized mean difference based on a random effects model were calculated. We identified 13 RCTs (19 comparisons) as follows: 7 comparisons with 1059 patients for OLA-IM versus placebo; 5 comparisons with 613 patients for OLA-IM versus haloperidol (HAL)-IM; 2 comparisons with 108 patients for OLA-IM versus ziprasidone (ZIP)-IM; 2 comparisons with 110 patients for OLA-IM versus HAL-IM plus midazolam; and 3 comparisons with 412 patients for OLA-IM versus HAL-IM plus promethazine, 2 comparisons with 355 patients for OLA-IM versus lorazepam-IM (LOR-IM); and 1 comparison with 67 patients for OLA-IM versus HAL-IM plus LOR-IM. OLA-IM was superior to placebo in both Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PANSS-EC) and Agitation-Calmness Evaluation Scale (ACES) scores 2 h after first injection, and had a comparable side effect profile, including over sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia, and anticholinergic use. While there was no significant difference in PANSS-EC scores after 2 h between OLA-IM and HAL-IM, OLA-IM outperformed HAL-IM in ACES after 2 h. Compared with HAL-IM, OLA-IM was associated with fewer side effects, including anticholinergic use, akathisia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and dystonia, and marginally less QT prolongation compared with HAL-IM. Based on our findings, OLA-IM is preferable to HAL-IM for the treatment of agitated patients. However, comparator data for ZIP-IM, LOR-IM and HAL-IM combination therapy were insufficient.", 
    "110": "Translocator proteins (TSPOs) are conserved, ubiquitous membrane proteins identified initially as benzodiazepine-binding proteins in mammalian cells. Recent genetic and biochemical studies have challenged the accepted model that TSPOs are essential and required for steroidogenesis in animal cells. Instead, evidence from different kingdoms of life suggests that TSPOs are encoded by nonessential genes that are temporally upregulated in cells encountering conditions of oxidative stress, including inflammation and tissue injury. Here we discuss how TSPOs may be involved in complex homeostasis signaling mechanisms. We suggest that the main physiological role of TSPOs may be to modulate oxidative stress, irrespective of the cell type or subcellular localization, in part through the subtle regulation of tetrapyrrole metabolism.", 
    "111": "Neuropeptide S (NPS) has a multidirectional regulatory activity, especially when considered as a potent endogenous anxiolytic factor. Accumulating data suggests that neuroleptics affect peptidergic signaling in various brain structures. However, there is no information regarding the influence of treatment with antipsychotics on brain NPS expression. In the current study, we assessed the NPS and NPS receptor (NPSR) mRNA levels in the brains of rats shortly and chronically treated with chlorpromazine and olanzapine using quantitative real-time PCR. Both single-dose and long-term (4\u00a0months) olanzapine treatment led to the upregulation of NPS expression in the rat hypothalamus. It supports the hypothesis that NPS is involved in the dopamine-dependent anxiolytic actions of selected neuroleptics and possibly also in the pathophysiology of mental disorders. On the other hand, NPSR expression decreased after single-dose and chronic chlorpromazine administration in the hypothalamus, as well as after chronic olanzapine and chlorpromazine administration in the striatum and hippocampus. These results cast a new light on the pharmacology of antipsychotics and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for their action. Furthermore, our findings underline the complex nature of potential interactions between dopamine receptors and brain peptidergic pathways, which has potential clinical applications.", 
    "112": "Epidemiological studies of the association between drug use and involvement in road traffic crashes (RTCs) published from January 1998 to February 2015 have been reviewed. Cohort andpopulation studies compared RTC involvement among drug users and non-drug users, case-control studies compared drug use among RTC-involved and non-RTC-involved drivers, and responsibility studies and case-crossover studies were performed for RTC-involved drivers. Difficulties associated with the types of studies are discussed with a special focus on case-control studies. Statistically significant associations between drug use and RTC involvement were found for benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics in 25 out of 28 studies, for cannabis in 23 out of 36 studies, for opioids in 17 out of 25 studies, for amphetamines in 8 out of 10 studies, for cocaine in 5 out of 9 studies, and for antidepressants in 9 out of 13 studies. It was a general trend among studies that did not report significant associations between the use of these drugs and increased RTC risk that they often had either poor statistical power or poor study design compared to studies that found an association. Simultaneous use of two or more psychoactive drugs was associated with higher RTC risk. Studies on the combination of alcohol and drugs have not been reviewed in this article even though this combination is known to be associated with the highest RTC risk.",

    "117": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. However, it is also produced in other sites; notably by pancreatic \u03b2 cells and immune cells. The function of GABA in the immune system is at an early stage of study, but it exerts inhibitory effects that are relevant to autoimmune diseases. The study of GABAergic interactions in the immune system has centered on three main aspects: 1) the expression of GABA and the relevant GABAergic molecular machinery; 2) the in vitro response of immune cells; and 3) therapeutic applications in autoimmune diseases. T cells and macrophages can produce GABA, and express all the components necessary for a GABAergic response. There are two types of GABA receptors, but lymphocytes appear to express only type A (GABAAR); a ligand-gated chloride channel. Other immune cells may also express the type B receptor (GABABR); a G-protein coupled receptor. Activation of GABA receptors on T cells and macrophages inhibits responses such as production of inflammatory cytokines. In T cells, GABA blocks the activation-induced calcium signal, and it also inhibits NF-\u03baB activation. In preclinical models, therapeutic application of GABA, or GABAergic (agonistic) drugs, protects against type 1 diabetes (T1D), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and contact dermatitis. In addition, GABA exerts anti-apoptotic and proliferative effects on islet \u03b2 cells, which may be applicable to islet transplantation. Autoimmunity against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65; synthesizes GABA) occurs in T1D. Antigen therapy of T1D with GAD65 or proinsulin in mice has protective effects, which are markedly enhanced by combined GABA therapy. Clinically, autoantibodies against GAD65 and/or GABA receptors play a pathogenic role in several neurological conditions, including stiff person syndrome (SPS), some forms of encephalitis, and autoimmune epilepsy. GABAergic drugs are widely used in medicine, and include benzodiazepines, barbiturates, anticonvulsants, and anesthetic drugs such as propofol. Native GABA can be administered orally to humans as a drug, and has few adverse effects. However, the immune effects of GABAergic drugs in patients are not well documented. GABAergic immunobiology is a recent area of research, which shows potential for the development of new therapies for autoimmune diseases.", 
    "118": "The primary management of alcohol withdrawal involves the administration of a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid agonist, such as benzodiazepines, for management of symptoms and to prevent further progression to seizure or delirium tremens. Despite escalating doses of benzodiazepines, published literature indicates that some patient's alcohol withdrawal syndrome symptoms do not respond, and that the use of adjunctive agents may be beneficial in these patients. Dexmedetomidine, an \u03b12-agonist, serves as a potential adjunctive agent through management of associated autonomic symptoms. Understanding of recent literature evaluating its use is necessary for appropriate selection.",

    "123": "A metabolic mechanism-based characterization of antiepileptic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) with clobazam in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) was performed using a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) approach. To characterize potential DDIs with clobazam, pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 153 patients with LGS in study OV-1012 (NCT00518713) and 18 healthy participants in bioavailability study OV-1017 were pooled. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were grouped based on their effects on the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes responsible for the metabolism of clobazam and its metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB): CYP3A inducers (phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), CYP2C19 inducers (valproic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine), or CYP2C19 inhibitors (felbamate, oxcarbazepine). CYP3A4 inducers-which did not affect the oral clearance of clobazam-significantly increased the formation of N-CLB by 9.4%, while CYP2C19 inducers significantly increased the apparent elimination rate of N-CLB by 10.5%, resulting in a negligible net change in the PK of the active metabolite. CYP2C19 inhibitors did not affect N-CLB elimination. Because concomitant use of AEDs that are either CYP450 inhibitors or inducers with clobazam in the treatment of LGS patients had negligible to no effect on clobazam PK in this study, dosage adjustments may not be required for clobazam in the presence of the AEDs investigated here.", 
    "124": "Effects of benzodiazepines on postmortem opioid parent and parent/metabolite blood concentration ratios were determined for fentanyl-, hydrocodone-, methadone-, or oxycodone-related accidental deaths. These opioids are partially metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme system, which is also affected by diazepam and alprazolam. Opioid/metabolite combinations examined were as follows: fentanyl/norfentanyl, hydrocodone/dihydrocodeine, methadone/EDDP, and oxycodone/oxymorphone. Parent opioid concentrations were analyzed for 877 deaths. Parent/metabolite concentration ratios were analyzed for 349 deaths, excluding cases with co-intoxicants present known to interfere with opioid elimination. Alprazolam in combination with diazepam significantly decreased median hydrocodone concentrations by 48% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) compared to hydrocodone alone. The methadone parent/metabolite concentration ratio was reduced by 35% in the presence of diazepam compared to methadone alone (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Benzodiazepines did not statistically significantly affect fentanyl or oxycodone concentrations. Possible factors affecting opioid concentrations and possible toxicity development, including any differential effects on specific opioids, should continue to be explored.", 
    "125": "Over the last several years, evidence has accumulated that the GABAA receptor is compromised in animal models for fragile X syndrome (FXS), a common hereditary form of intellectual disability. In mouse and fly models, agonists of the GABAA receptor were able to rescue specific consequences of the fragile X mutation. Here, we imaged and quantified GABAA receptors in vivo in brain of fragile X patients using Positron Emission Topography (PET) and [11C]flumazenil, a known high-affinity and specific ligand for the benzodiazepine site of GABAA receptors. We measured regional GABAA receptor availability in 10 fragile X patients and 10 control subjects. We found a significant reduction of on average 10% in GABAA receptor binding potential throughout the brain in fragile X patients. In the thalamus, the brain region showing the largest difference, the GABAA receptor availability was even reduced with 17%. This is one of the first reports of a PET study of human fragile X brain and directly demonstrates that the GABAA receptor availability is reduced in fragile X patients. The study reinforces previous hypotheses that the GABAA receptor is a potential target for rational pharmacological treatment of fragile X syndrome.",

Seven individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in adverse effects between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions. Three individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in pain at the injection site between intravenous propofol and alternative interventions. Four individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in participant satisfaction between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions (ketamine, etomidate, midazolam). All the studies employed propofol without the use of an adjunctive analgesic and all, except one, were small (fewer than 100 participants) studies. The quality of evidence for the adverse effects and participant satisfaction outcomes was very low.Nine included studies (eight comparisons) reported all the secondary outcome measures of the review except mortality. It was not possible to pool the results of the included studies for any of the secondary outcome measures because the comparator interventions were different and the measures were reported in different ways.

    "148": "The choice of an efficient psychotropic treatment for patients with schizophrenia is a key issue to improve prognosis and quality of life and to decrease the related burden and costs. As for other complex disorders, response to drugs in schizophrenia is highly heterogeneous and the underlying molecular mechanisms of this diversity are still poorly understood. In a carefully followed-up cohort of schizophrenic patients prospectively treated with risperidone or olanzapine, we used a specially designed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to perform a large-scale genomic analysis and identify genetic variants associated with response to psychotropic drugs. We found significant associations between response to treatment defined by the reduction in psychotic symptomatology 42 days after the beginning of treatment and SNPs located in the chromosome 6, which houses the human leukocyte antigen (HLA). After imputation of the conventional HLA class I and class II alleles, as well as the amino-acid variants, we observed a striking association between a better response to treatment and a double amino-acid variant at positions 62 and 66 of the peptide-binding groove of the HLA-A molecule. These results support the current notion that schizophrenia may have immune-inflammatory underpinnings and may contribute to pave the way for personalized treatments in schizophrenia.", 
    "149": "Second-generation antipsychotics including olanzapine are associated with weight gain, dyslipidemia and other metabolic disorders. Both animal and clinical studies have shown that co-treatment with betahistine (a histamine H1 receptor agonist/H3 receptor antagonist) is effective in controlling olanzapine-induced weight gain. In the present study, we investigate whether co-treatment with betahistine is able to prevent dyslipidemia induced by chronic olanzapine treatment and the underlying mechanisms. Female rats were orally administered with olanzapine (1 mg/kg, t.i.d.) for 3.5 consecutive weeks and then a 2.5-week drug withdrawal. Then, rats were divided into 4 groups for 5 weeks treatment: (1) vehicle, (2) olanzapine-only (1 mg/kg, t.i.d.), (3) betahistine-only (9.6 mg/kg, t.i.d.), and (4) olanzapine and betahistine (O+B) co-treatment. After completing treatment, hepatic mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR, while the protein levels were detected by western blot. In our study, olanzapine-only treatment significantly increased triglyceride accumulation and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and upregulated mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and its target genes, while these alterations were ameliorated by O+B co-treatment. Hepatic AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1 (AMPK\u03b1) was activated in the O+B co-treatment group, with a significant reduction in nuclear SREBP-1 protein expression but an increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) and its-responsive molecule(CPT1A), compared with olanzapine-only treatment. In addition, olanzapine significantly increased hepatic histamine H1 receptors, while O+B co-treatment significantly reversed them to normal levels. This study provided the first evidence that betahistine could act on hepatic H1 receptors via modulation of AMPK\u03b1-SREBP-1 and PPAR\u03b1-dependent pathways to ameliorate olanzapine-induced dyslipidemia in rats.", 
    "150": "Anthropogenic pollutants and in particular pharmaceutical residues are a potential risk for potable water where they are found in increasing concentrations. Different environmental effects could already be linked to the presence of pharmaceuticals in surface waters even for low concentrations. Many pharmaceuticals withstand conventional water treatment technologies. Consequently, there is a need for new water purification techniques. Advanced oxidation processes (AOP), and especially plasmas with their ability to create reactive species directly in water, may offer a promising solution. We developed a plasma reactor with a coaxial geometry to generate large volume corona discharges directly in water and investigated the degradation of seven recalcitrant pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine, diatrizoate, diazepam, diclofenac, ibuprofen, 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol, trimethoprim). For most substances we observed decomposition rates from 45% to 99% for treatment times of 15-66\u00a0min. Especially ethinylestradiol and diclofenac were readily decomposed. As an inherent advantage of the method, we found no acidification and only an insignificant increase in nitrate/nitrite concentrations below legal limits for the treatment. Studies on the basic plasma chemical processes for the model system of phenol showed that the degradation is primarily caused by hydroxyl radicals.", 
    "151": "A main traditional use of European Leonurus cardiaca and East Asian Leonurus japonicus is in the treatment of neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, nervousness, and as a sedative for insomnia. However, their mechanism of action is still under discussion. As anxiety and depressive disorders are increasingly being recognized as connected to dysfunctions of the gamma-aminobutyric acid system, the in vitro effects of standardized L. cardiaca and L japonicus extracts as well as five of their isolated constituents, namely, the labdane-type isoleosibirin, the novel iridoid 7R-chloro-6-desoxy-harpagide, the phenylethanoid lavandulifolioside, and the N-containing compounds stachydrine and leonurine, on this type of neuronal receptor were investigated for the first time. Extracts of L. cardiaca and L. japonicus, characterized by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography determination, as well as their above named isolated, possible active constituents of different chemical nature were tested in several receptor binding assays at rat GABAA receptors using [(3)H]-SR95\u200a531 and [(3)H]-Ro-15-1788 (flumazenil)/diazepam control. The L. cardiaca and L. japonicus extracts as well as leonurine inhibited the concentration-dependent binding of [(3)H]-SR95\u200a531 to the gamma-aminobutyric acid site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor with a high binding affinity: IC50s 21\u2009\u00b5g/ml, 46\u2009\u00b5g/ml, and 15\u2009\u00b5g/ml, respectively. In contrast, binding to the benzodiazepine site of the rat gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor had a 15 to 30 times lower binding affinity than to the gamma-aminobutyric acid site. The presented experiments provide hints that the neurological mechanism of action of L. cardiaca and L. japonicus may essentially be based on their interaction to the gamma-aminobutyric acid site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor, while the benzodiazepine site most probably does not contribute to this effect. In the case of L. japonicus, these effects can be at least partially explained by its leonurine constituent, whereas the active principle of L. cardiaca, which does not contain leonurine, is subject to further research as none of the other investigated individual constituents displayed significant activity in the applied test system.", 
    "152": "Neural activity is closely followed by a localised change in cerebral blood flow, a process termed neurovascular coupling. These hemodynamic changes form the basis of contrast in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and are used as a correlate for neural activity. Anesthesia is widely employed in animal fMRI and neurovascular studies, however anesthetics are known to profoundly affect neural and vascular physiology, particularly in mice. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of a novel 'modular' anesthesia that combined injectable (fentanyl-fluanisone/midazolam) and volatile (isoflurane) anesthetics in mice. To characterize sensory-evoked cortical hemodynamic responses, we used optical imaging spectroscopy to produce functional maps of changes in tissue oxygenation and blood volume in response to mechanical whisker stimulation. Following fine-tuning of the anesthetic regime, stimulation elicited large and robust hemodynamic responses in the somatosensory cortex, characterized by fast arterial activation, increases in total and oxygenated hemoglobin, and decreases in deoxygenated hemoglobin. Overall, the magnitude and speed of evoked hemodynamic responses under anesthesia resembled those in the awake state, indicating that the novel anesthetic combination significantly minimizes the impact of anesthesia. Our findings have broad implications for both neurovascular research and longitudinal fMRI studies that increasingly require the use of genetically engineered mice.",

    "175": "The diuretic agent bumetanide has recently been put forward as a novel, promising treatment of behavioral symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related conditions. Bumetanide can decrease neuronal chloride concentrations and may thereby reinstate \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, strategies to select appropriate candidates for bumetanide treatment are lacking. We hypothesized that a paradoxical response to GABA-enforcing agents such as benzodiazepines may predict the efficacy of bumetanide treatment in neurodevelopmental disorders. We describe a case of a 10-year-old girl with ASD, epilepsy, cortical dysplasia, and a 15q11.2 duplication who had exhibited marked behavioral arousal after previous treatment with clobazam, a benzodiazepine. We hypothesized that this response indicated the presence of depolarizing excitatory GABA and started bumetanide treatment with monitoring of behavior, cognition, and EEG. The treatment resulted in a marked clinical improvement in sensory behaviors, rigidity, and memory performance, which was substantiated by questionnaires and cognitive assessments. At baseline, the girl's EEG showed a depression in absolute \u03b1 power, an electrographic sign previously related to ASD, which was normalized with bumetanide treatment. The effects of bumetanide on cognition and EEG seemed to mirror the \"nonparadoxical\" responses to benzodiazepines in healthy subjects. In addition, temporal lobe epilepsy and cortical dysplasia have both been linked to disturbed chloride homeostasis and seem to support our assumption that the observed paradoxical response was due to GABA-mediated excitation. This case highlights that a paradoxical behavioral response to GABA-enforcing drugs may constitute a framework for targeted treatment with bumetanide.",

A novel synthesised compound, 12P, was identified as new microtubule inhibitor. This compound inhibits tubulin polymerisation through binding to the colchicine-binding site of tubulin. 12P exhibits excellent anti-proliferative activities against a panel of human cancer cell lines, with IC\u2085\u2080 values range from 9 to 55nM. Interestingly, compound 12P also displayed equally potent cytotoxicity against several drug-resistant cell lines, and it showed high selectivity for active human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Further flow cytometric analysis showed that 12P induces G\u2082/M phase arrest and apoptosis in A549 cells. Cellular studies have revealed that the induction of apoptosis by 12P was associated with a collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alterations in the expression of some cell cycle-related proteins (e.g. Cyclin B1, Cdc25c, Cdc2) and some apoptosis-related proteins (e.g. Bax, Bad, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl). Importantly, 12P significantly reduced the growth of xenograft tumours of A549 cells in vivo (tumour inhibitory rate of 12P: 84.2%), without any loss of body weight. Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo results suggested that 12P may become a promising lead compound for the development of new anticancer drugs.",

Alprazolam significantly reduced scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Penn State Worry Questionnaire after one week and 28 days of treatment. Brain activation in the amygdala during the EFMT and in the insula during the STIMEX was reduced one hour after alprazolam administration but returned to baseline levels at Day 28. Exploratory analyses revealed significant treatment differences in brain activity during the STIMEX on Day 28 in frontal lobe, caudate nucleus, middle temporal gyrus, secondary visual cortex, and supramarginal gyrus.

Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between socio-demographic characteristics and drug use.", 
    "192": "Concurrent use was detected in 11.5% of the sample. Concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines or use of either drug alone was associated with being White, female, married, prescribed psychiatric medications, having seen a physician in the past two years, cannabis use, and having a drug-related offense. Concurrent users were more likely to be unemployed or disabled and have received counseling, and less likely to have completed college, live with relatives or friends, have a history of hallucinations, or have an offense against a person relative to nonusers.", 
    "193": "While significant overlap of risk factors exists between individuals with concurrent use versus sole use of opioids or benzodiazepines, individuals with concurrent use generally have more social dysfunction than individuals who tested for either substance alone. Concurrent users may need more psychosocial resources and intensive treatments to promote recovery.", 
    "194": "1.\u2002The metabolism of midazolam was investigated in vivo in locusts in order to evaluate the presence of an enzyme with functionality similar to human CYP3A4/5. 2.\u2002Hydroxylated metabolites of midazolam identical to human metabolites were detected in locusts and the apparent affinities (Km values) were in the same range as reported in humans (in locusts: 7-23 and 33-85\u2009\u00b5M for the formation of the 1'-OH and 4-OH metabolites, respectively). 3.\u2002The formation of hydroxylated metabolites could successfully be inhibited by co-administration of ketoconazole, a known CYP3A4/5 inhibitor. 4.\u2002Besides phase I metabolites, a number of conjugated metabolites were detected using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The most abundant metabolites detected were structurally identified by (1)H NMR as two N-glucosides. NMR analysis strongly suggested that the glycosylation occurred at the two nitrogens (either one in each case) of the imidazole ring. 5.\u2002Distribution of midazolam and the glucose conjugates were successfully measured using desorption electrospray mass spectrometry imaging revealing time-dependent changes in distribution over time. 6.\u2002In conclusion, it appears that an enzyme with functionality similar to human CYP3A4/5 is present in locusts. However, it appears that conjugation with glucose is the main detoxification pathway of midazolam in locusts.",

    "199": "Black widow spider envenomation generally results in self-limiting pain that can be treated in the emergency department (ED) with analgesics and benzodiazepines, usually with no further intervention. Occasionally, a patient has to be admitted or treated with antivenom for refractory pain or a venom-induced complication. We present the case of an 84-year-old man who presented to our ED with chest pain and dyspnea after being bitten on the foot by a western black widow spider (Lactrodectus hesperus). His initial cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was elevated at 0.07 ng/ml and continued to rise to a peak of 0.17 ng/ml. He also had rhabdomyolysis, another uncommon complication of black widow envenomation. An elevated cTnI generally signifies myocardial injury and is rarely seen after black widow envenomation. We discuss the possible etiologies for an elevated cardiac biomarker, in this context, and review potentially serious complications of widow spider envenomation presenting with chest symptoms and an elevated cardiac biomarker.",

The primary outcome measure was the percentage change in mental state examination symptoms between admission and discharge and the association with medication on discharge. Exploratory analyses evaluated the specificity of individual medication effects on symptom clusters.", 
    "202": "There were fewer drugs prescribed at discharge relative to admission, suggesting an optimisation of medication, and a doubling of the number of patients treated with clozapine. Treatment with clozapine on discharge was associated with maximal decrease in symptoms from admission. In the group of patients that did not respond to clozapine monotherapy, the most effective drug combinations were clozapine augmentation with 1) sodium valproate, 2) lithium, 3) amisulpride, and 4) quetiapine. There was no support for a dose-response relationship for any drug combination.", 
    "203": "Clozapine monotherapy is clearly the optimal medication in medication refractory schizophrenia and it is possible to maximise its use. In patients unresponsive to clozapine monotherapy, augmentation with sodium valproate, lithium, amisulpride and quetiapine, in that order, is a reasonable treatment algorithm. Reducing the number of ineffective drugs is possible without a detrimental effect on symptoms. Exploratory data indicated that clozapine was beneficial across a range of symptoms domains, whereas olanzapine was beneficial specifically for hallucinations and lamotrigine for comorbid affective symptoms.",

Benzodiazepine-resistant alcohol withdrawal (RAW) is a subset of severe alcohol withdrawal defined by the requirement of \u226540mg of diazepam administered within one hour. Use of adjunct agents, such as propofol, may be beneficial to minimize BZD adverse effects and improve symptom control. While limited evidence suggests propofol as an effective adjunct in AWS through improved sedation, evidence is currently lacking for the addition of only propofol to BZDs for management of RAW.", 
    "205": "Retrospective review of adult patients from January, 2009 to March, 2012 with RAW. Patients were categorized into BZD dose-escalation only or BZD plus propofol.

Median time to AWS resolution was 5.0 and 7.0 days for BZD only vs. BZD plus propofol (p=0.025). Duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital length of stay were significantly higher with propofol (p=0.017, <0.001 and <0.001, respectively). Ten patients required intervention for management of propofol-induced adverse reactions.", 
    "207": "The addition of propofol for RAW treatment is associated with significant increases in clinical care. While randomized, prospective evaluations are necessary to determine the cause of this association, our data suggests use of adjunctive propofol therapy in RAW is associated with longer and more complicated hospital admissions.",

Little is known about the long-term (i.e., over decades) fate of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems. Here, we show that the most prescribed anxiolytic in Sweden (oxazepam) persists in its therapeutic form for several decades after being deposited in a large freshwater lake. By comparing sediment cores collected in 1995 and 2013, we demonstrate that oxazepam inputs from the early 1970s remained in the sediments until sampling in 2013, despite in situ degradation processes and sediment diagenesis. In laboratory and pond experiments, we further reveal that therapeutic forms of oxazepam can persist over several months in cold (5 \u00b0C) lake water free from UV light. We conclude that oxazepam can persist in lakes over a time scale much longer than previously realized and that levels can build up in lakes due to both a legacy of past inputs and a growing urban population.", 
    "229": "Benzodiazepines are commonly used medications that alter sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, however the topographic changes to these functionally significant waveforms have yet to be fully elucidated. This study utilized high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) to investigate topographic changes in sleep spindles and spindle-range activity caused by temazepam during NREM sleep in 18 healthy adults. After an accommodation night, sleep for all participants was recorded on two separate nights after taking either placebo or oral temazepam 15 mg. Sleep was monitored using 256-channel hdEEG. Spectral analysis and spindle waveform detection of sleep EEG data were performed for each participant night. Global and topographic data were subsequently compared between temazepam and placebo conditions. Temazepam was associated with significant increases in spectral power from 10.33 to 13.83 Hz. Within this frequency band, temazepam broadly increased sleep spindle duration, and topographically increased spindle amplitude and density in frontal and central-posterior regions, respectively. Higher frequency sleep spindles demonstrated increased spindle amplitude and a paradoxical decrease in spindle density in frontal and centroparietal regions. Further analysis demonstrated temazepam both slowed the average frequency of spindle waveforms and increased the relative proportion of spindles at peak frequencies in frontal and centroparietal regions. These findings suggest that benzodiazepines have diverse effects on sleep spindles that vary by frequency and cortical topography. Further research that explores the relationships between topographic and frequency-dependent changes in pharmacologically-induced sleep spindles and the functional effects of these waveforms is indicated.", 
    "230": "The rising use of nonanesthesiologist-administered sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy has clinical significances. Most endoscopic patients require some forms of sedation and/or anesthesia. The goals of this sedation are to guard the patient's safety, minimize physical discomfort, to control behavior and to diminish psychological responses. Generally, moderate sedation for these procedures has been offered by the non-anesthesiologist by using benzodiazepines and/or opioids. Anesthesiologists and non-anesthesiologist personnel will need to work together for these challenges and for safety of the patients. The sedation training courses including clinical skills and knowledge are necessary for the registered nurses to facilitate the patient safety and the successful procedure. However, appropriate patient selection and preparation, adequate monitoring and regular training will ensure that the use of nurse-administered sedation is a feasible and safe technique for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures.", 
    "231": "Flavonoids that are found in nutraceuticals have many and varied effects on the activation of ionotropic receptors for GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in our brains. They can act as positive or negative modulators enhancing or reducing the effect of GABA. They can act as allosteric agonists. They can act to modulate the action of other modulators. There is considerable evidence that these flavonoids are able to enter the brain to influence brain function. They may have a range of effects including relief of anxiety, improvement in cognition, acting as neuroprotectants and as sedatives. All of these effects are sought after in nutraceuticals. A number of studies have likened flavonoids to the widely prescribed benzodiazepines as 'a new family of benzodiazepine receptor ligands'. They are much more than that with many flavonoid actions on ionotropic GABA receptors being insensitive to the classic benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil and thus independent of the classic benzodiazepine actions. It is time to consider flavonoids in their own right as important modulators of these vital receptors in brain function. Flavonoids are rarely consumed as a single flavonoid except as dietary supplements. The effects of mixtures of flavonoids and other modulators on GABAA receptors need to be more thoroughly investigated.",
