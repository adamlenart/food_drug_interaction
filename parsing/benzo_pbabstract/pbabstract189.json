A total of 470 women incarcerated in six jurisdictions in Australia were interviewed for the female component of the DUCO project. This study examines illegal drug use prior to arrest and the correlates of drug use among these incarcerated women. Regular use of illegal drugs in the 6 months prior to arrest was reported by 62% of offenders and 39% reported multiple drug use. Indigenous women reported higher rates of cannabis use while non-Indigenous women had higher rates of heroin, amphetamines and benzodiazepines as well as multiple drug use. Multivariate analysis identified the following statistically significant predictors of regular drug use prior to arrest: age, marital status, not having children, early exposure to drug problems among family members, violent victimisation as an adult, earning an income primarily from crime or sex work and using amphetamines, benzodiazepines or morphine on prescription. Additional factors predicting multiple drug use were low education, non-Indigenous status, having mental health problems and having been in juvenile detention. These results suggest that drug treatment that fails to identify and respond to some of the antecedents of drug use such as mental health problems and the effects of violent victimisation may result in higher rates of drug use relapse and lower success upon release from prison.", 
    "1": "For colorectal surgery, evidence suggests that optimal management includes: no pre-operative fasting, a thoracic epidural analgesia continued for 2 days post-operatively, and avoidance of fluid overload. In addition, no long-acting benzodiazepines on the day of surgery and use of short-acting anaesthetic medication may be beneficial. We examined whether these strategies have been adopted in five northern-European countries.",

    "3": "The response rate was 74% (n = 191). Although periods of pre-operative fasting up to 48 h were reported, most (> 85%) responders in all countries declared to adhere to guidelines for pre-operative fasting and oral clear liquids were permitted until 2-3 h before anaesthesia. Solid food was permitted up to 6-8 h prior to anaesthesia. In all countries more than 85% of the responders indicated that epidural anaesthesia was routinely used. Except for Denmark, long-acting benzodiazepines were still widely used. Short-acting anaesthetics were used in all countries except Scotland where isoflurane is the anaesthetic of choice. With the exception of Denmark, intravenous fluids were used unrestrictedly.", 
    "4": "In northern Europe, most anaesthesiologists adhere to evidence-based optimal management strategies on pre-operative fasting, thoracic epidurals and short-acting anaesthetics. However, premedication with longer-acting agents is still common. Avoidance of fluid overload has not yet found its way into daily practice. This may leave patients undergoing elective colonic surgery at risk of oversedation and excessive fluid administration with potential adverse effects on surgical outcome.", 
    "5": "This double blind study was undertaken to determine the safety and efficacy of orally administered newer sedatives and analgesics for conscious sedation in 120 child patients. Patients were randomly assigned into: Midazolam (I), Ketamine (II), Zolpidem (III), Midazolam plus Ketamine (IV), Midazolam plus Tramadol (V) and Zolpidem plus Tramadol (VI) groups of 20 each. Onset of action, level of sedation, ease of treatment completion, recovery time, and post-operative amnesia were assessed for all and compared. Midazolam plus ketamine was found the most effective combination providing a fast and adequate analgo-sedation in anxious and uncooperative child patients.", 
    "6": "GABA(A) receptors mediate both fast phasic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and slower tonic extrasynaptic inhibition. Hyperpolarizing phasic GABAergic inhibition requires the activity of neuron-specific chloride-extruding potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 in adult CNS. However, the possible role of KCC2 in tonic GABAergic inhibition and the associated behaviors is unknown. Here, we have examined the role of KCC2 in phasic vs tonic GABA inhibition by measuring the behavioral effects of pharmacological agents that presumably enhance phasic vs tonic inhibition in mice that retain 15-20% of normal KCC2 protein levels. These KCC2-deficient mice show decreased sensitivity to diazepam-induced sedation and motor impairment consistent with the reported role for KCC2 in fast hyperpolarizing inhibition. In contrast, the mice exhibit normal responses to low-dose alcohol-induced motor impairment, gaboxadol-induced sedation, and neurosteroid-induced hypnosis; behaviors thought to be associated with tonic GABAergic inhibition. Electrophysiological recordings show that the tonic conductance is not affected. The results suggest that KCC2 activity is more critical for behaviors dependent on phasic than tonic GABAergic inhibition.",

    "8": "To evaluate the binding properties of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in mouse fibrosarcoma, [(3)H]PK-11195 binding, in vitro and in vivo, was investigated using either tissue dissection or autoradiographic method. The binding characteristics in fibrosarcoma were compared with those in the kidney. The results of an in vitro saturation study revealed that the maximal numbers of PBR binding sites (B(max)) in fibrosarcoma and in the kidney were almost the same (kidney: 5.2 pmol/mg protein; fibrosarcoma: 5.0 pmol/mg protein). On the other hand, the binding affinity (K(d)) in fibrosarcoma was lower than that in the kidney (kidney: 0.45 nM; fibrosarcoma: 1.34 nM). It is noteworthy that the in vivo binding of [(3)H]PK-11195 in fibrosarcoma increased with increasing doses of [(3)H]PK-11195 (in the dose range of 0.03-1 mg/kg), whereas that in the kidney decreased with competitive inhibition. The apparent positive cooperativity of [(3)H]PK-11195 binding in fibrosarcoma was only observed under in vivo conditions and might be possibly related to the incoordination of PBR subunits.", 
    "9": "Sedation administration and agitation management are fundamental activities in any intensive care unit. A lack of objective measures of agitation and sedation, as well as poor understanding of the underlying dynamics, contribute to inefficient outcomes and expensive healthcare. Recent models of agitation-sedation dynamics have enhanced understanding of the underlying dynamics and enable development of advanced protocols for semi-automated sedation administration. In this research, the agitation-sedation model parameters are identified using an integral-based fitting method developed in this work. Parameter variance is then analysed over 37 intensive care unit patients. The parameter identification method is shown to be effective and computationally inexpensive, making it suited to real-time clinical control applications. Sedative sensitivity, an important model parameter, is found to be both patient-specific and time-varying. However, while the variation between patients is observed to be as large as a factor 10, the observed variation in time is smaller, and varies slowly over a period of days rather than hours. The high fitted model performance across all patients show that the agitation-sedation model presented captures the fundamental dynamics of the agitation-sedation system. Overall, these results provide additional insight into the system and clinical dynamics of sedation management.", 
    "10": "Over the last decades, the inhibition of spontaneous burying of glass marbles by mice has been used as an index of anxiolytic drug action in the so-called marble burying test. Indeed, acute administration of rapid-onset (e.g. diazepam) and slow-onset (e.g. fluoxetine) anxiolytics inhibit marble burying. However, non-anxiolytic compounds such as classical antipsychotics also reduce marble burying thus suggesting that the predictive validity of this procedure for anxiety may be limited. In the present study, after having selected a strain of mice (C57BL/6J) that showed spontaneous avoidance of glass marbles, we tried to improve the predictive validity of the marble burying test for anxiety by measuring locomotor activity during the marble burying test and--if needed--in control experiments by using a videotracking system. Twenty-four reference compounds were tested including anxiolytics, anxiogenics, antidepressants, antipsychotics and other classes. By comparing marble burying scores with locomotor measures, we found that, based on our criteria, most of the anxiolytics and antidepressants selectively inhibited marble burying in contrast to most of the other compounds (e.g. haloperidol, morphine). Two putative anxiolytics, i.e. the nociceptin orphanin FQ peptide receptor agonist Ro 64-6198 and the metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine, also showed a selective profile. We propose this modified procedure, requiring only a limited number of animals, as a valuable screening test for the detection of compounds having anxiolytic effects.",

Multiple drugs are available for this purpose. Strategies that optimize comfort while minimizing the predilection for sedative and analgesic drug accumulation with prolongation of effect have been shown to improve outcomes. In particular, such strategies may decrease mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit length of stay, and complications associated with critical illness.",

    "18": "Clonidine has recently been used as a pre-operative medication and sedative/anxiolytic drug. Its extended duration of action makes it suitable for longer procedures. In this randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial, we characterized the effects of oral clonidine pre-treatment on intravenous diazepam/meperidine sedation using the bi-spectral index (BIS) in 13 participants. Clonidine significantly increased the numbers of BIS-depressed readings and percent memory loss during sedation, while reducing total diazepam and post-operative analgesic dosages by 44% and 55%, respectively. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures, as well as pulse rates, were reduced. Respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO(2), and recovery from sedation were unchanged. Participants, surgeons, and sedationists preferred clonidine over the placebo. Clonidine pre-treatment increased and prolonged sedation and amnesia and stabilized vital signs while significantly decreasing diazepam and post-operative analgesic usage. These results suggest that pre-operative clonidine administration could be a useful supplement to intravenous sedation for dental procedures of long duration.",

Preoperatively and 4-6 wk after surgery, the patients' cognitive status was assessed with a cognitive test battery consisting of processing speed index, working memory index, and verbal memory index. Processing speed index was 113.7 +/- 1.5 (mean +/- se) in the lower BIS group versus 107.9 +/- 1.4 in the higher BIS group (P = 0.006). No difference was observed in the other two test battery components. Somewhat deeper levels of anesthesia were therefore associated with better cognitive function 4-6 wk postoperatively, particularly with respect to the ability to process information.", 
    "20": "When dolphins sleep, their electroencephalographic activity may change in only one cerebral hemisphere; i.e., the left and right brain hemispheres can take turns sleeping. We demonstrate that the bispectral index (BIS) monitor can detect interhemispheric asymmetry in the dolphin species Tursiops truncatus. Using two BIS sensors placed simultaneously over each side of the dolphin's head, we often, but not always, found significant differences between the two BIS values (e.g., left side 60 and right side 90) in non-medicated animals and in animals given propofol, atropine, and/or diazepam. Observations were each made over a period of approximately 3 h on dolphins resting out of the water. Unihemispheric effects may be inducible pharmacologically in dolphins. The dolphin, with its human-sized brain, may provide an animal model for study of unihemispheric effects in humans.",

After ischemia-reperfusion injury, PBR mRNA significantly increased between days 1 and 7 in cortex and outer medulla. PBR protein increased between days 1 and 7, and was transiently expressed in proximal tubules at days 1 and 3 and returned to basal level at day 7.

Sodium pentobarbital (SP)-induced hypnosis potentiation (SPP), as well as ambulatory activity and anti-anxiety response in three different experimental models were evaluated with hexane and methanol extracts in mice. In order to determine the proper timing of assessments and to identify the most active extract, a 100mg/kg dosage of hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol crude extracts were tested on SPP after 15, 30 and 60min of the administration. Then a dose-response curve was made for the hexane (10-1000mg/kg) and methanol (10-300mg/kg) extracts in all experimental models. Both extracts produced a significant and dose-dependent lengthening in the time of SP, with the methanol extract being more potent than the hexane extract at 60min after administration. Moreover, a significant and dose-dependent attenuation in the anxiety-response in the plus-maze test and exploratory cylinder activity, but also a diminution in the ambulatory activity and in the head dipping response were observed resembling the response to diazepam. Acute toxicity was observed with less dose of methanol extract (LD(50)=375mg/kg) in comparison to the hexane extract (LD(50)>2900mg/kg). Results of the present study shows that Tilia americana var. mexicana possesses depressant activity on the CNS similar to the better-studied species of European Tilia and reinforces its use as anxiolytic and sedative in traditional medicine.",

Forty patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists grades I and II, admitted for extraction of impacted mandibular third molars were included in this randomised, prospective study. They were given an intravenous bolus of midazolam 0.03 mg/kg and then allowed to use patient-controlled sedation. In the midazolam group, 2 ml of 0.5 mg/ml midazolam was given automatically. In the midazolam-remifentanil group, 2 ml of 0.5 mg/ml midazolam and 12.5 microg/ml remifentanil were given in the same manner. The lockout period was 5 min. Vital signs and oxygen saturation were recorded. Patients' and surgeons' satisfaction, and the patients' degree of amnesia about the local anaesthetic, drilling, removal of the tooth, and pain during extraction were also assessed. There were no significant differences between systolic and diastolic blood pressures during sedation, but heart rate after 30 min in the combined group was significantly lower than in the midazolam group (p<0.05). Surgeons described the midazolam group as excellent in 9 and good in 11. In the combined group, satisfaction was excellent in 11, good in 7, and satisfactory or unacceptable in 1 of each. Immediately postoperatively, 19 patients in each group ranked their satisfaction as excellent and 1 as good. Twenty-four hours later it was unchanged in the midazolam group, while 15 patients in the other group thought it was excellent, 3 good, and 2 poor. Patient-controlled analgesia with midazolam or midazolam and remifentanil is safe and reliable during extraction of third molars.", 
    "31": "Increased binding of the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site (PBBS) ligand [(3)H]PK11195 in the central nervous system of patients suffering from acute and chronic neuropathology has been associated with reactive microgliosis. However, it remains uncertain which stages of microglial activation occur in conjunction with the increased [(3)H]PK11195 binding. We used quantitative autoradiography for [(3)H]PK11195 and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for PBBS mRNA and markers of early and late microglial activation to investigate the time-course of cellular responses in the hippocampus of mice with degeneration of the entorhinal-hippocampal perforant path. The axonal lesion evoked an increase in the B(max) for [(3)H]PK11195 in hippocampus which peaked at 2 days post-lesion, remained elevated at day 5 and began to decline at 10 days post-lesion. These changes occurred in the absence of significant changes in affinity in vitro. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of isolated hippocampi using exon-specific primers indicated the presence of several splice variants of PBBS mRNA, which appeared to be affected differentially by the lesion. The changes in PBBS mRNA and CD11b mRNA levels correlated with the B(max) for [(3)H]PK11195 during 10 days post-lesion, suggesting that microglial activation couples with increases in mRNA levels for these markers. In addition, the onset of changes in PBBS mRNA levels coincided with the significantly elevated tumor necrosis factor mRNA levels present during early microglial activation at 2 days post-lesion. We conclude that up-regulation of [(3)H]PK11195 binding and PBBS mRNA levels coincided with early microglial activation, characterized by concomitantly increased microglial tumor necrosis factor mRNA levels, and persisted throughout the period with reactive microgliosis.", 
    "32": "Alcohol has been shown to interfere with testosterone (T) release from Leydig cells. However, the mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon, which may include decreased activity of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)-LH axis, as well as a direct influence of the drug on the testes, are not fully understood. In this work, we investigated the influence of alcohol, administered intragastrically (i.g.) or delivered via vapors, on Leydig cell activity and T release. Leydig cell function was studied by measuring changes in the levels of the steroidogenic proteins steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR), the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), and the cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc). Testosterone release was studied under basal conditions or in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Finally, to identify potential factors mediating the influence of alcohol, we measured the testicular variant of the neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS), TnNOS, in semipurified Leydig cells.", 
    "33": "Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were either injected with alcohol i.g. once or exposed to alcohol vapors (4 h/d) for 1 or 5 days. Controls received the vehicle (i.g. model) or were kept in boxes through which no vapors were circulated. Following these treatments, one series of experiments was devoted to investigate Leydig cell responsiveness by measuring plasma T levels before or after the intravenous injection of hCG (1 U/kg). In another series of experiments, we used semipurified Leydig cell preparations to measure StAR, PBR, P450scc, and TnNOS by Western blot analysis.", 
    "34": "In the i.g. model, the T response to hCG was blunted for 12 hours following alcohol injection, but showed a rebound at 48 hours. Levels of StAR protein and of PBR, but not of P450scc, were significantly decreased within 10 minutes of drug administration. While StAR then remained depressed for 24 hours, PBR values were variable over this time course. By 48 hours, StAR, PBR, and P450scc levels had increased above control values. Both StAR and PBR levels showed correlations with plasma T levels. In the alcohol vapor models, both regimens of the drug also significantly depressed StAR and PBR protein concentrations, blunted the T response to hCG, and did not alter P450scc. Finally, we observed that alcohol delivered i.g. or via vapors up-regulated TnNOS levels in Leydig cells, but that blockade of NO formation failed to restore a normal T response to hCG.", 
    "35": "Collectively, these results suggest that (a) the ability of Leydig cells to release T does not show a simple correlation with changes in StAR, PBR, and P450scc levels; (b) the time course of the alcohol-induced changes were protein-specific; and (c) despite the ability of alcohol to stimulate TnNOS expression, NO does not appear to mediate the inhibitory influence of this drug on testicular steroidogenesis in the models that we studied.",

This study describes the prevalence of hip fractures and the incidence and risk factors associated with hip and other fractures in representative groups of HD facilities (n=320) and patients (n=12 782) from the 12 countries in the second phase of the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (2002-2004). Among prevalent patients, 2.6% had a prior hip fracture. The incidence of fractures was 8.9 per 1000 patient years for new hip fractures and 25.6 per 1000 for any new fracture. Older age (relative risk (RR)(HIP)=1.91, RR(ANY)=1.33, P<0.0001), female sex (RR(HIP)=1.41, P=0.02; RR(ANY)=1.59, P<0.0001), prior kidney transplant (RR(HIP)=2.35, P=0.04; RR(ANY)=1.76, P=0.007), and low serum albumin (RR(HIP)=1.85, RR(ANY)=1.45, per 1 g/dl lower, P<0.0001) were predictive of new fractures. Elevated risk of new hip fracture was observed for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and combination narcotic medications (RR=1.63, RR=1.74, respectively, P<0.05). Several medications were associated with risk of any new fracture: narcotic pain medications (RR=1.67, P=0.02), benzodiazepines (RR=1.31, P=0.03), adrenal cortical steroids (RR=1.40, P<0.05), and combination narcotic medications (RR=1.72, P=0.001). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels >900 pg/ml were associated with an elevated risk of any new fracture (RR=1.72, P<0.05) versus PTH 150-300. The results suggest that greater selectivity in prescribing several classes of psychoactive drugs and more efficient treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism may help reduce the burden of fractures in HD patients.", 
    "41": "Disruption of intracellular calcium initiates multiple cell-damaging processes, such as apoptosis. In normal cells, the levels of Ca(2+) are low in the mitochondria, whereas in apoptotic cells, Ca(2+) increases. Mitochondria uptake Ca(2+) via an inner membrane channel called the uniporter and extrude it into the cytoplasm through a Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. Overload of Ca(2+) in the mitochondria in CGP-treated cells leads to its damage, thus affecting cellular function and survival. The goal of these experiments was to determine the importance of mitochondrial calcium ([Ca(2+)](m)) in apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we have examined the advantages of increasing the [Ca(2+)](m) and treating the cells with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a potent apoptotic agent. Our results show that, under these treatment conditions, inhibiting the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger using benzothiazepin CGP-37157 (CGP) did not induce apoptosis. However, combination of CGP and TRAIL increased the apoptotic response approximately 25-fold compared with control. Increase in apoptosis followed enhanced levels of [Ca(2+)](m) and was accompanied by pronounced mitochondrial changes characteristic of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Experiments with calcium ionophores showed that mere increase in cytosolic and/or mitochondrial Ca(2+) was not sufficient to induce apoptosis. These results have therapeutic implications as inhibitors of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger are being used for treating some neurologic and cardiologic ailments, and TRAIL induces apoptosis preferentially in cancer cells. Furthermore, this system provides an excellent model to investigate the role of [Ca(2+)](m) in apoptosis.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the vascular response of human lung tumor xenografts in vivo to RO0281501, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Human non-small cell lung carcinoma (H460a) xenografts grown s.c. in athymic nu/nu mice were treated p.o. with the antiangiogenic agent RO0281501. Treatment-induced changes in tumor volume, epiphyseal growth plate thickness, and microvessel density assessed by CD31 immunohistochemistry were analyzed. Tumor vascular permeability and perfusion were measured in tumors using DCE-MRI with gadopentetate dimeglumine on a 1.5 T clinical scanner to assess vascular function. Treatment with RO0281501 resulted in significant growth retardation of H460a tumors. RO0281501-treated tumors showed histologic evidence of growth plate thickening and relatively lower microvessel density compared with the controls. Regarding DCE-MRI variables, the initial slope of contrast uptake and Ak(ep) were significantly decreased on day 7 of treatment. RO0281501 is a novel antiangiogenic/antitumor agent, which is active in the H460a xenograft model. Its effects on tumor vasculature can be monitored and assessed by DCE-MRI on a 1.5 T human MR scanner with clinically available gadopentetate dimeglumine contrast, which will facilitate clinical trials with this or similar agents.",

However, such models require comprehensive information on the ontogeny of anatomical, physiological and biochemical variables; data that are not available from single sources. The Simcyp software integrates demographic, genetic, physiological and pathological information on adults with in vitro data on human drug metabolism and transport to predict population distributions of drug clearance (CL) and the extent of metabolic drug-drug interactions. The algorithms have now been extended to predict clearance and its variability in paediatric populations by incorporating information on developmental physiology and the ontogeny of specific cytochrome P450s.",

    "51": "The ability to deliver safe and effective moderate sedation is crucial to the ability to perform invasive procedures. Sedative drugs should have a quick onset of action, provide rapid and clear-headed recovery, and be easy to administer and monitor. A number of drugs have been demonstrated to provide effective sedation for outpatient procedures but since each agent has its own limitations, a thorough knowledge of the available drugs is required to choose the appropriate drug, dose and/or combination regimen for individual patients. Midazolam, propofol, ketamine and sevoflurane are the most frequently used agents, and all have a quick onset of action and rapid recovery. The primary drawback of midazolam is the potential for accumulation of the drug, which can result in prolonged sedation and a hangover effect. The anaesthetics propofol and sevoflurane have recently been used for sedation in procedures of short duration. Although effective, these agents require monitored anaesthesia care. Ketamine is an effective agent, particularly in children, but there is concern regarding emergence reactions. AQUAVAN injection (fospropofol disodium), a phosphorylated prodrug of propofol, is an investigational agent possessing a unique and distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile. Compared with propofol emulsion, AQUAVAN is associated with a slightly longer time to peak effect and a more prolonged pharmacodynamic effect. Advances in the delivery of sedation, including the development of new sedative agents, have the potential to further improve the provision of moderate sedation for a variety of invasive procedures.",

    "75": "A key feature of schizophrenia is the inability to screen out irrelevant sensory input. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response, a cross-species measure of sensorimotor gating, provides a valuable opportunity to study this feature. PPI is reliably impaired in schizophrenia. Animal models of disrupted PPI have proved valuable for the evaluation of antipsychotic substances. The cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic circuitry is primarily responsible for modulation of PPI in animals. We examined PPI and its brain correlates, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in men with schizophrenia treated with typical or atypical antipsychotics. Thirty men with schizophrenia on stable doses of typical antipsychotics (n=10), risperidone (n=10) or olanzapine (n=10; 9 with usable fMRI data) and 12 healthy men underwent psychophysiological testing and fMRI during a tactile PPI paradigm. The results showed reduced PPI of the eye-blink startle response in patients compared with healthy controls. Within the patient group, those on typical antipsychotics showed significantly impaired PPI but risperidone- or olanzapine-treated patients showed a milder (non-significant) deficit. Increased activity in the striatum, thalamus, insula, hippocampal, temporal, inferior frontal and inferior parietal regions occurred in association with PPI in controls. Patients treated with risperidone or olanzapine, but not with typical antipsychotics, showed significant activation in PPI-relevant regions. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that atypical antipsychotics positively influence PPI and partially restore associated brain functions in schizophrenia. Imaging data buttress the validity of PPI as a useful animal model of schizophrenia.", 
    "76": "Compared with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) seem to be neuroprotective and trigger neuroplasticity. Because neuroplasticity is regulated by a variety of neurotrophic factors we studied differential effects of haloperidol (HAL, a FGA) and olanzapine (OLZ, a SGA) on temporal expression of erythropoietin (EPO), a potent neuroprotective factor and its receptor (EPOr) in rat brain. Rats (8-10/group) were treated with HAL or OLZ for 14 days (HAL-14 or OLZ-14) or 45 days (HAL-45 or OLZ-45). Animals were killed by decapitation or by perfusion to collect brains for immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis respectively. In hippocampus, the levels of both EPO and EPOr were significantly increased in HAL-14 (p < 0.001) and OLZ-14 (p < 0.001) groups. Their levels decreased in HAL-45 compared with levels in HAL-14 (EPO, p < 0.001; EPOr, p < 0.05), whereas the levels were further increased (EPO, p < 0.05) in OLZ-45 compared with OLZ-14. In striatum, the levels of both EPO and EPOr were unchanged in HAL-14 and EPO levels significantly decreased in HAL-45 (p < 0.05), whereas their levels were significantly increased in OLZ-14 and OLZ-45 compared with the vehicle-treated control (p < 0.001). Both EPO and EPOr were primarily expressed by neurons and endothelial cells. These data suggest that SGAs such as OLZ may have neuroprotective effects through expression of EPO that may be clinically relevant for long-term safe and beneficial management of psychotic patients.",

    "81": "The contribution of immune system to schizophrenia has been an important area of focus in schizophrenia research. Several genetic variants in the cytokine system have been associated with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a pharmacogenetic relationship exists between a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist gene (IL-1RN) and clinical improvement during antipsychotic treatment in patients with a first non-affective psychotic episode. One hundred and fifty-four subjects presenting with a first non-affective psychotic episode were randomly assigned to treatment with haloperidol, risperidone, or olanzapine and rated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) both at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. A control sample of 336 blood bank donors was also included. No differences in genotype or allele distributions were found between patients and controls. However, after controlling for baseline SANS scores, the genotype in the VNTR polymorphism in the IL-1RN gene significantly predicted negative symptom improvement, accounting for approximately 7% of the variance (F = 5.23, df = 2, P = 0.006). The mean decrease in SANS scores was 58% for the IL-1RN* 2/2, 44% for the IL-1RN* 1/2, and 14% for the IL-1RN* 1/1 subjects, respectively. These results suggest that the VNTR polymorphism in the IL-1RN gene may be a useful predictor of negative symptom improvement in schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "82": "Humulus lupulus (hops) is traditionally used as a tranquilizing herbal remedy. Here, we investigated the in vivo and in vitro effect of hop beta-acids on central nervous system function. Oral administration of beta-acids (5-10mg/kg) in rats produced an increased exploratory activity in the open field, a reduction in the pentobarbital hypnotic activity and a worsening of picrotoxin-induced seizures. When dosed at 10mg/kg, beta-acids increased, in the elevated plus maze, open arm entries reducing in parallel those in closed arms. In the forced swimming test, we observed a reduction in the immobility time that could suggest an antidepressant-like activity. Electrophysiological studies performed on cerebellar granule cells in culture showed that the beta-acids fraction decreased GABA-evoked current in a dose-dependent way. The effect was not inhibited by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. Benzodiazepine receptors involvement was also excluded by [(3)H]-Ro 15-1788 binding assay. In conclusion, the behavioral effects of beta-acids fraction could be explained by a reduction in the GABAergic activity although we cannot rule out the involvement of other neurotransmitter systems.",

Compounds 11 and 12 demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity over the monomer counterparts against the growth of P815 murine mastocytoma cells in culture. Conjugate 11 was found to covalently react with adenine-N3 positions within the minor groove at AT-rich sequences and to produce DNA interstrand crosslinks.

EPM results showed that the longer the exposition to the deficient diet, the lower the anxiety of malnourished animals, a result similar to that produced by the treatment with DZ. This anxiolytic-like effect suggested that short-term malnutrition may affect neural and/or neurochemical systems believed to underlie behavioral expression in anxiogenic experimental situations.",

The frontal cortex (FC) regulates stress responses, and its dysfunction contributes to certain neuropsychiatric disorders. We tested the effects of exposure to predator odor stress (POS), a psychogenic stressor, on the concurrent efflux of four major neurotransmitters within the FC in mice in comparison to immobilization stress (IMS), a physical/systemic stressor. POS and IMS significantly increased efflux of acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA), but not norephinephrine, within the FC. POS produced a somewhat longer-lasting efflux of 5-HT, as compared to IMS. The effects of POS and IMS on ACh, 5-HT and DA were blocked by chlordiazepoxide. Overall, we demonstrate a novel method to measure the effects of distinctly different stress modalities on FC neurotransmission and suggest that FC responsivity to stressors may be an important marker for evaluating anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "90": "Administration of benzodiazepines or serotonin reuptake inhibitors in combination with behavior therapy for the treatment of many anxiety disorders has generally lead to only modest gains. In this article we suggest that pharmacotherapy aimed not at treating the symptoms of anxiety but instead aimed at improving the learning that takes place in exposure therapy might actually improve the effectiveness of exposure therapy. This idea was based on animal work showing that the partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) facilitated extinction of fear when given either before or shortly after exposure to fearful cues, reduced return of fear that is normally seen when extinction training is followed by stress, and led to generalized extinction, where DCS given in combination with exposure to one fearful cue led to extinction to another cue previously paired with the same aversive event. These finding suggested that DCS might facilitate exposure-based psychotherapy, which was verified in a small clinical study showing that DCS facilitated exposure therapy for fear of heights in a well-controlled virtual reality environment.", 
    "91": "Plasma membrane P-glycoprotein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of membrane transporters. In the present study tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence was used to understand the P-glycoprotein response to three benzodiazepines (bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide and flurazepam) in the presence and absence of ATP. Fluorescence emission spectra showed a red shift on the maximal emission wavelength upon interaction of P-glycoprotein with all benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine association with nucleotide-bound P-glycoprotein also showed this trend and the quenching profile was attributed to a sphere-of-action model, for static fluorescence. Furthermore, quenching data of benzodiazepine-bound P-glycoprotein with ATP were concentration dependent and saturable, indicating that nucleotide binds to P-glycoprotein whether drug is present or not. These results seems in agreement with the proposal of the ATP-switch model by Higgins and Linton, where substrate binding to the transporters initiates the transport cycle by increasing the ATP binding affinity.", 
    "92": "The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of strong advice to withdraw the overused medication with the effectiveness of two structured pharmacological detoxification strategies in a cohort of patients diagnosed with probable migraine overuse headache (MOH) plus migraine and presenting low medical needs. One hundred and twenty patients participated in the study. Exclusion criteria included: previous detoxification treatments, coexistent medical or psychiatric illnesses and overuse of agents containing opioids, benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Group A received only intensive advice to withdraw the overused medication. Group B underwent a standard out-patient detoxification programme (advice+prednisone+preventive treatment). Group C underwent a standard in-patient withdrawal programme (as in group B + fluid replacement and antiemetics). Withdrawal therapy was considered successful if, after 2 months, the patient had reverted to an episodic pattern of headache and to an intake of symptomatic medication on fewer than 10 days/month. We were able to detoxify 75.4% of the whole cohort, 77.5% of patients in group A, 71.7% of patients in group B and 76.9% of those in group C (P>0.05). In patients with migraine plus MOH and low medical needs, effective drug withdrawal may be obtained through the imparting of advice alone.", 
    "93": "Antipsychotic drugs (APD) are widely prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia. The APD are differentiated into typical and atypical based on the lower incidence of extra-pyramidal side-effects associated with the newer atypical APD. It was suggested that atypicality may arise from an interaction with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2) receptor and specifically on the 5-HT(2):dopamine D(2) affinity ratio. It is now realised that multiple subtypes of these receptors exist and that in addition, atypical APD interact with many monoamine receptors. The aim of the present study was to characterise the interaction of APD with a variety of monoamine receptors in terms of both affinity and efficacy. The data produced has highlighted that the atypical profile of APD such as olanzapine and clozapine may reflect antagonism of the 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors, whilst that of, ziprasidone and quetiapine may reflect partial agonist activity at the 5-HT(1A) receptor, and that of aripiprazole may reflect partial agonist activity at the 5-HT(1A) receptor as well as is its claimed partial agonist activity at the dopamine D(2) receptor.",

The control (placebo) and experimental (bromazepam 6 mg) groups were submitted to a typewriting task in a randomized, double-blind design. The findings did not show significant differences in attentional and motor measures between groups. Coherence measures (qEEG) were evaluated between scalp regions, in theta, alpha and beta bands. A first analysis revealed a main effect for condition (Anova 2-way--condition versus blocks). A second Anova 2-way (condition versus scalp regions) showed a main effect for both factors.

Either dexmedetomidine (group D) (4 microg.kg(-1).h(-1)) or midazolam (group M) (0.4 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) was administered intravenously for 15 minutes before the first operation. At the second operation, the other agent was applied. Cardiorespiratory data were collected. The intraoperative sedation level, patient cooperation, and postoperative performance were scored and any pain reaction during the local anesthetic injection was recorded. Visual analog scales were additionally used for the subjective assessment of pain and patient satisfaction.

The symptoms were initially regarded as further manifestations of her somatic symptoms of depression, and paroxetine was increased to 30 mg/day resulting in frequent clonus, increased shivering, serious dysarthria, ongoing impairment in visual acuity and agitation. These symptoms subsided upon paroxetine discontinuation. Ten mg/day of paroxetine rechallenge provoked dysarthria, tremor and headache, but these symptoms improved again upon paroxetine discontinuation. These findings indicate that the patient's symptoms were not somatic in origin but were in fact the symptoms of serotonin syndrome. In conclusion, the present case suggests the difficulty in diagnosing serotonin syndrome in a patient with somatic symptoms.",

    "109": "Various strains of mice display a reliable increase in motor activity in response to benzodiazepines given at low to moderate doses. This hyperactivity has been described as both an anxiolytic-associated increase in exploratory activity and a nonspecific stimulant effect controlled by central neural mechanisms separate from those involved in the anxiolytic-like effects. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the neural circuitry underlying the hyperactivity effects of benzodiazepines in mice. Specifically, we examined the relationship between anxiety and motor activity after bilateral intra-amygdala or intra-hippocampal microinjections of the nonselective full benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam in C57BL/6 mice. Behavioral measures of anxiety and motor activity in open field were examined in mice given localized injections of 0, 2, 8 or 32 nmol of midazolam directed into the amygdala or hippocampus. Midazolam injected into the amygdala at the low dose produced an anxiolytic-like effect, as reflected by an increase in central open field activity. Higher doses injected into the amygdala produced a motor-depressant action, indicative of a drug-induced sedative effect. Infusions into the hippocampus produced a biphasic effect on motor activity with the two lower doses of midazolam producing a motor-stimulant action and the high dose producing a motor-depressant effect. Hippocampus injections produced no anxiolytic-like effects. The current findings demonstrate that injections of midazolam produced a regional dissociation of the anxiety-related and motor-related parameters and provide evidence that the stimulant and anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines are independent phenomena regulated by different central mechanisms.", 
    "110": "Previous studies suggested that adenosine A1 and A2A receptor agonists counteract behavioral effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists while adenosine receptor antagonists may produce opposite effects enhancing the actions of NMDA receptor antagonists. To further evaluate the effects of combined administration of adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine and various NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists on brain stimulation reward (discrete-trial threshold current intensity titration procedure), rats with electrodes implanted into the ventral tegmental area were tested after pretreatment with NMDA receptor channel blocker MK-801 (0.01-0.3 mg/kg), competitive antagonist D-CPPene (0.3-5.6 mg/kg), glycine site antagonist L-701,324 (1.25-5 mg/kg), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist GYKI-53655 (1-10 mg/kg), metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) antagonist MPEP (1-10 mg/kg) alone and in combination with caffeine (1-30 mg/kg). MK-801 (0.056 and 0.1 mg/kg) was the only tested glutamate antagonist that lowered self-stimulation thresholds, while D-CPPene (5.6 mg/kg) and MPEP (5.6 and 10 mg/kg) had the opposite effects. Threshold-increasing effects of D-CPPene, but not of MPEP, however, were associated with marked impairment of operant performance, reflected by longer latencies to respond and higher rates of responding during the inter-trial intervals. Operant performance was also disrupted by the highest dose of MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg). For subsequent experiments, caffeine (1-30 mg/kg) was combined with the highest doses of NMDA receptor antagonists that did not lower the brain stimulation reward thresholds and did not impair operant performance. Caffeine had no appreciable effects on self-stimulation behavior when given alone. A low dose of caffeine (3 mg/kg) significantly lowered self-stimulation thresholds only when given together with MK-801 (0.03 mg/kg) or D-CPPene (3 mg/kg). Combined with the same antagonist drugs, higher doses of caffeine (10 and 30 mg/kg) facilitated time-out responding. These results indicate that, within a limited dose range, caffeine in combination with an NMDA receptor channel blocker and a competitive antagonist significantly lowers brain stimulation reward thresholds in rats.", 
    "111": "Most of the currently used methods for functional brain imaging do not visualize neuronal activity directly but rather rely on the elicited hemodynamic and/or metabolic responses. Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter, plays an important role in the neurovascular/neurometabolic coupling, but the specific mechanisms are still poorly understood. To investigate the role of the two major ionotropic glutamate receptors [NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) and AMPA receptors (AMPA-Rs)] for the generation of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals, we used fMRI [measurements of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and cerebral blood volume (CBV)] together with recordings of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) during electrical forepaw stimulation in the alpha-chloralose anesthetized rat. Intravenous injection of the NMDA-R antagonist MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate] (0.06 mg/kg plus 3.6 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) significantly decreased BOLD (-51 +/- 19%; n = 5) and PWI (-57 +/- 26%; n = 5) responses but reduced the SEPs only mildly (approximately -10%). Systemic application of the AMPA-R antagonist GYKI-53655 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine] significantly decreased both the hemodynamic response (BOLD, -49 +/- 13 and -65 +/- 15%; PWI, -22 +/- 48 and -68 +/- 4% for 5 and 7 mg/kg, i.v., respectively; CBV, -80 +/- 7% for 7 mg/kg; n = 4) and the SEPs (up to -60%). These data indicate that the interaction of glutamate with its postsynaptic and/or glial receptors is necessary for the generation of blood flow and BOLD responses and illustrate the differential role of NMDA-Rs and AMPA-Rs in the signaling chain leading from increased neuronal activity to the hemodynamic response in the somatosensory cortex.",

    "113": "RLS was first described in the 17th century and further characterized in 1945. RLS is a common disorder, occurring in about 10% of the population. Patients with RLS often describe the urge to move, uncomfortable sensations, and pain, which begin or worsen during rest or inactivity such as lying or sitting. Symptoms of RLS make sleeping difficult for many patients, and significant daytime difficulties result from the condition. RLS can either be primary or arise from secondary causes that lead to iron deficiency. There is a familial component in primary RLS, but its underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Of individuals with conditions associated with iron-deficiency states, including pregnancy, renal failure, and anemia, 25-30% may develop RLS. The goals of RLS treatment include improving its symptoms and the patient's quality of life. There are limited data on the treatment of RLS. Pharmacologic therapies include iron replacement, dopaminergic agents (e.g., levodopa), dopamine agonists, anticonvulsants, opioids, and benzodiazepines. There have been no systematic trials of nonpharmacologic therapies for RLS, but good sleep hygiene and avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may improve symptoms.",

    "115": "Here we address the effects of cyclothiazide (CTZ), an allosteric inhibitor of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor desensitization, on low [Mg(2+)]-induced seizure-like events (SLEs) recorded from the CA3 pyramidal layer of juvenile rat hippocampal slices. CTZ (100 microM) made the period of tonic-like discharges (161 +/- 18% of control) and the whole SLE (151 +/- 15% of control) longer (in 7 of 9 slices) or induced endless SLE by stabilizing clonic-like bursting (in 2 of 9 slices). CTZ (30 microM) had no significant effects on SLE dynamics (n = 4), whereas 300 microM CTZ induced endless SLEs in four of eight slices. Co-application of CTZ (100 microM) with 100 microM GYKI-52466, the allosteric inhibitor of AMPA receptor function, restrained the effects of CTZ and shortened SLEs and their tonic phases to 37 +/- 4.2 and 47 +/- 4.2% of the control, respectively. Effects of GYKI-52466 and GYKI-52466 with CTZ on SLE dynamics were indistinguishable. 4-aminopyridine (4-AP; 50 microM) alone (n = 5) or in combination with CTZ (n = 6) transformed recurrent SLE pattern into incessant epileptiform activity with patterns distinguishable from those under 100 microM CTZ application. The effect of 4-AP may suggest a role for facilitated presynaptic glutamate release in disrupting recurrent dynamics. In contrast, the self-similar slow-down of low [Mg(2+)]-induced SLE dynamics by CTZ indicate AMPA receptor desensitization as a parameter shaping SLEs.", 
    "116": "Recent work suggests neurons can have different types of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors that mediate phasic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) and tonic currents. This study examines the diversity of GABAergic synaptic currents in parasympathetic cardioinhibitory neurons that receive rhythmic bursts of GABAergic neurotransmission. Focal application of gabazine (25 microM) to cardiac vagal neurons in vitro did not change the frequency of firing in spontaneously active neurons or the resting membrane potential; however, picrotoxin (100 microM) significantly depolarized cardiac vagal neurons and increased their firing. Similarly, gabazine (25 microM) selectively blocked GABAergic IPSCs but did not change holding current in cardiac vagal neurons, whereas picrotoxin (100 microM) not only blocked GABAergic IPSCs but also rapidly decreased the tonic current. Because the tonic current could be attributable to activation of GABA receptors by ambient GABA or, alternatively, spontaneous opening of constitutively active GABA channels, an antagonist for the GAT-1 GABA transporter NO-711 (10 microM) was applied to distinguish between these possibilities. NO-711 did not significantly alter the holding current in these neurons. The benzodiazepine flunitrazepam (1 microM) significantly increased the tonic current and GABAergic IPSC decay time; surprisingly, however, in the presence of gabazine flunitrazepam failed to elicit any change. These results suggest cardiac vagal neurons possess gabazine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors that mediate phasic synaptic currents, a gabazine-insensitive but picrotoxin-sensitive extrasynaptic tonic current that when blocked depolarizes and increases the firing rate of cardiac vagal neurons, and benzodiazepines recruit a third type of GABA(A) receptor that is sensitive to gabazine and augments the extrasynaptic tonic current.",

The patient presented with a 2-week history of fever and increasing confusion, in the context of a number of changes to his medication regimen. On presentation, he was noted to be febrile with autonomic instability, diaphoresis and marked rigidity. He was disoriented and responding to visual hallucinations. Investigations revealed an elevated creatine kinase and a provisional diagnosis of PHS was made. After the patient failed to respond during a 2-week period to supportive measures, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment was commenced. A good response to eight bilateral ECT treatments was achieved, with resolution of his confusional state and associated psychotic phenomena. We discuss the nosological and management issues associated with this case and discuss the role of ECT as a treatment modality in this condition.",

The peptide R-715 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and the non-peptide benzodiazepine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) antagonists significantly decreased cellular migration (predominantly neutrophils), without altering plasma exudation. SSR240612 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) diminished total cells and neutrophils, besides exudation. Oral administration of SSR240612 (10 mg/kg) also reduced total cell and neutrophil counts. Only the benzodiazepine antagonist inhibited the lung myeloperoxidase activity. No tested antagonist significantly altered the lung and pleural TNFalpha and IL-1beta production. We provide interesting evidence on the anti-inflammatory in vivo effects of non-peptide B(1) receptor antagonists.", 
    "119": "People often make logically sound decisions using explicit reasoning strategies, but sometimes it pays to rely on more implicit \"gut-level\" intuition. The transitive inference paradigm has been widely used as a test of explicit logical reasoning in animals and humans, but it can also be solved in a more implicit manner. Some researchers have argued that the hippocampus supports relational memories required for making logical inferences. Here we show that the benzodiazepene midazolam, which inactivates the hippocampus, causes profound explicit memory deficits in healthy participants, but enhances their ability in making implicit transitive inferences. These results are consistent with neurocomputational models of the basal ganglia-dopamine system that learn to make decisions through positive and negative reinforcement. We suggest that disengaging the hippocampal explicit memory system can be advantageous for this more implicit form of learning.",

We recommend that ketamine anaesthesia be encouraged in disaster area surgery, particularly in under-resourced regional centres.", 
    "121": "Positron emission tomography (PET) pharmacokinetic analysis involves fitting of measured PET data to a PET pharmacokinetic model. The fitted parameters may, however, suffer from bias or be unrealistic, especially in the case of noisy data. There are many optimization algorithms, each having different characteristics. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate (1) the performance of different optimization algorithms and (2) the effects of using incorrect weighting factors during optimization in terms of both accuracy and reproducibility of fitted PET pharmacokinetic parameters. In this study, the performance of commonly used optimization algorithms (i.e. interior-reflective Newton methods) and a simulated annealing (SA) method was evaluated. This SA algorithm, known as basin hopping, was modified for the present application. In addition, optimization was performed using various weighting factors. Algorithms and effects of using incorrect weighting factors were studied using both simulated and clinical time-activity curves (TACs). Input data, taken from [(15)O]H(2)O, [(11)C]flumazenil and [(11)C](R)-PK11195 studies, were used to simulate time-activity curves at various variance levels (0-15% COV). Clinical evaluation was based on studies with the same three tracers. SA was able to produce accurate results without the need for selecting appropriate starting values for (kinetic) parameters, in contrast to the interior-reflective Newton method. The latter gave biased results unless it was modified to allow for a range of starting values for the different parameters. For patient studies, where large variability is expected, both SA and the extended Newton method provided accurate results. Simulations and clinical assessment showed similar results for the evaluation of different weighting models in that small to intermediate mismatches between data variance and weighting factors did not significantly affect the outcome of the fits. Large errors were observed only when the mismatch between weighting model and data variance was large. It is concluded that selection of specific optimization algorithms and weighting factors can have a large effect on the accuracy and precision of PET pharmacokinetic analysis. Apart from carefully selecting appropriate algorithms and variance models, further improvement in accuracy might be obtained by using noise reducing strategies, such as wavelet filtering, provided that these methods do not introduce significant bias.",

    "126": "Activation of calpain has been shown to occur in some contexts of cell injury and to be essential for loss of cell viability. Part of this may be mediated at the mitochondrial level. It has been demonstrated that calpain activity is necessary for the complete discharge of apoptosis-inducing factor from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and can cause the cleavage of full-length Bid to a more potent truncated form (Polster, B. M., Basanez, G., Etxebarria, A., Hardwick, J. M., and Nicholls, D. G. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 6447-6454). In this study, we identify acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) as playing a critical role in the activation of calpain upon exposure of mitochondria to both full-length Bid and truncated Bid (t-Bid). Suppression of ACBP levels by small interfering RNA inhibited the t-Bid-induced activation of mitochondrial mu-calpain and release of apoptosis-inducing factor from the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the cleavage of full-length Bid to t-Bid. Moreover, ACBP required the presence of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (for which ACBP is a ligand) to be retained at the mitochondria, to activate mu-calpain, and to amplify Bid-induced mitochondrial damage.", 
    "127": "Long-term video electroencephalographic (EEG) recording is currently a routine procedure in the presurgical evaluation of localization-related epilepsies. Cortical epileptogenic zone is usually localized from ictal recordings with intracranial electrodes, causing a significant burden to patients and health care. Growing literature suggests that epileptogenic networks exhibit aberrant dynamics also during seizure-free periods. We examined if neocortical epileptogenic regions can be circumscribed by quantifying local long-range temporal (auto-)correlations (LRTC) with detrended fluctuation analysis of seizure-free ongoing subdural EEG activity in 4 frequency bands in 5 patients. We show here with subdural EEG recordings that the LRTC are abnormally strong near the seizure onset area. This effect was most salient in neocortical oscillations in the beta frequency band (14-30 Hz). Moreover, lorazepam, a widely used antiepileptic drug, exerted contrasting effects on LRTC (n = 2): lorazepam attenuated beta-band LRTC near the epileptic focus, whereas it strengthened LRTC in other cortical areas. Our findings demonstrate that interictal neuronal network activity near the focus of seizure onset has pathologically strong intrinsic temporal correlations. The observed effect by lorazepam on beta-band activity suggests that the antiepileptic mechanism of benzodiazepines may be related to the normalization of LRTC within the epileptic focus. We propose that this method may become a promising candidate for routine invasive and noninvasive presurgical localization of epileptic foci.", 
    "128": "Dexras1 is a 30 kDa G protein in the Ras subfamily whose discovery was based on its pronounced inducibility by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. It binds to neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) via the adaptor protein CAPON, eliciting S-nitrosylation and activation of Dexras1. We report that Dexras1 binds to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein (PAP7), a protein of unknown function that binds to cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. PAP7 in turn binds to the divalent metal transporter (DMT1), an iron import channel. We have identified a signaling cascade in neurons whereby stimulation of NMDA receptors activates nNOS, leading to S-nitrosylation and activation of Dexras1, which, via PAP7 and DMT1, physiologically induces iron uptake. As selective iron chelation prevents NMDA neurotoxicity in cortical cultures, the NMDA-NO-Dexras1-PAP7-DMT1-iron uptake signaling cascade also appears to mediate NMDA neurotoxicity.",

In 2003, co-proxamol (93.7/1000 patients), benzodiazepines (52.4/1000 patients) and amitriptyline (45.4/1000, mainly at low doses) were the most frequently prescribed potentially inappropriate drugs.

    "134": "It has been argued that the efficacy superiority found in meta-analyses for some of the atypical antipsychotics is an artifact of higher dropout rates due to side effects in the haloperidol group combined with last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analyses. We therefore reanalyzed a number of pivotal studies comparing new generation antipsychotics (NGAs) and conventional antipsychotics (CAs). A total of 5 studies (n = 1271) comparing amisulpride and 3 studies (n = 2454) comparing olanzapine with CAs were reanalyzed using original patient data. We applied 4 different models: LOCF, completer analysis, LOCF but excluding dropouts due to adverse events, and LOCF but excluding all dropouts with the exception of dropouts related to efficacy. Effect sizes expressed as standardized mean differences between NGAs and CAs based on the 4 different analysis models were compared. The overall results were not different irrespective of the model used. Single studies, however, showed higher effect sizes when LOCF instead of other models was used. Overall, it does not seem that higher dropout rates due to side effects in the haloperidol groups together with LOCF analyses consistently biased the results in favor of amisulpride and olanzapine. Because the results of the single studies, however, showed that this may occasionally be the case, future studies should look at the data from different angles applying sensitivity analyses, and they may use alternative statistics such as mixed models, which need to be developed further. Ultimately, strategies to reduce dropout rates are needed.",

    "136": "Glutamatergic neurotransmission in the CNS plays a predominant role in learning and memory. While NMDA receptors have been extensively studied, less is known about the involvement of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in this area. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of mGluR1 and mGluR5 to both acquisition and expression of behaviours in contextual and auditory fear conditioning models. The effects of both receptor types were tested using selective antagonists: (3-ethyl-2-methyl-quinolin-6-yl)-(4-methoxy-cyclohexyl)-methanone methanesulfonate (EMQMCM) for mGluR1, and [(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) for mGluR5. Their effects on acquisition were compared to those of the NMDA receptor antagonist (+)MK-801, and the unselective muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, while diazepam and citalopram served as reference compounds in the expression experiments. EMQMCM (1.25 to 5mg/kg) impaired acquisition of contextual fear conditioning (CFC), but not auditory fear conditioning (AFC). Similarly, administration of MTEP during the acquisition phase impaired learning in CFC at doses of 2.5 to 10mg/kg, but was ineffective in AFC. When given before the retention test, both EMQMCM (1 and 3mg/kg) and MTEP (3mg/kg) impaired expression of CFC. In contrast, MTEP (2.5 and 5mg/kg) blocked the expression of AFC, while EMQMCM was ineffective. In conclusion, group I mGlu receptors are shown to be involved in the acquisition of hippocampus-dependent CFC, but not hippocampus-independent AFC. Unlike mGluR5, mGluR1 does not seem be involved in expression of AFC.",

Acute (24 and 48 h) and subchronic (16 days) treatment of rats with olanzapine induced a significant decrease in 5-HT2A receptor density both in frontal cortex (Bmax=76.2%, 83.0% and 46.0% of control after 24 h, 48 h and 16 days of treatment, respectively; P<0.01) and blood platelets (Bmax approximately 55% of control at all times measured; P<0.01), without any changes in receptor affinity. Furthermore, olanzapine induced redistribution in 5-HT2A-like immunoreactivity and time-dependent remodelling of synaptic circuits involved in the activity of pyramidal and GABAergic neurons in frontoparietal motor cortex of treated rats, as assessed by immunohistochemical studies. D3 receptor mRNA levels increased significantly by 52.5% (P<0.01) and 21.1% (P<0.05) in nucleus accumbens, and by 53.4% (P<0.05) and 91.7% (P<0.01) in lymphocytes, after acute (24 h and 48 h) treatment with olanzapine, returning to levels similar to control after subchronic treatment (16 days). In conclusion, we observed in rats after olanzapine treatment: (1) parallelism in the regulation of 5-HT2A receptors in frontal cortex and in blood platelets; (2) parallelism in the regulation of D3 mRNA levels in nucleus accumbens and lymphocytes. These results endorse the interest in future studies aimed at validating these receptors as candidate biomarkers in schizophrenia.", 
    "138": "There is no consensus with respect to the use of analgesia during femoral arterial sheath removal after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We performed a randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of intravenous sedation and local anesthesia during femoral sheath removal after PCI on patient comfort and the incidence of vasovagal reactions.", 
    "139": "All patients undergoing PCI whose femoral sheaths were to be removed with assisted manual compression were eligible. Patients were randomized to receive either intravenous sedation (Fentanyl and Midazolam) or local anesthesia (1% lignocaine) infiltrated around the sheath site or both or neither. The primary endpoint of the study was the patients reported worst pain according to a Visual Analogue scale (VAS) after sheath removal. The incidence and predictors of vasovagal reactions during sheath removal and occurrence of vascular complications was also determined.", 
    "140": "A total of 611 patients were randomized into this study. The mean pain score was highest in the local anesthesia only arm as compared to the sedation only arm, the combined local and sedation arm and the neither sedation or local arm (p=0.001). vasovagal reactions were experienced by 35 patients (5.1%) with the highest percentage in the local anesthesia only group (9.8%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified a higher pain score (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.24, p=0.001), use of glyceryl trinitrate during sheath removal (OR 9.05, 95% CI 5.06-16.1, p<0.001), a lower body mass index (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.08-1.18, p=0.009) and the left anterior descending artery as the treated vessel (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.41-7.87, p<0.001) as independent predictors of the occurrence of a vasovagal reaction. There was no significant difference in vascular complications between the 4 study groups.", 
    "141": "The routine use of fentanyl and midazolam prior to sheath removal leads to a reduction in pain perception and vasovagal incidence, whilst the routine use of local infiltration during sheath removal should be discouraged as it leads to more pain and a trend to more vasovagal reactions.",

This type of \"before-and-after study\" allowed the dogs to receive 3 different routes of flumazenil administration (IV, IL, and SM) following an initial dose of midazolam (0.5 mg/kg IV). Blood samples were obtained (at 0, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 30 minutes) for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of flumazenil and midazolam, and oxygen saturation values were recorded.", 
    "144": "Both IL and SM delivery of flumazenil were determined to be viable alternatives to immediate IV administration for reversing benzodiazepine-induced oxygen saturation (SaO2) desaturation. For flumazenil to be able to reverse the SaO2 desaturation, the plasma levels must be greater than 5 ng/ml, which was exceeded by IL and SM drug delivery.",

Nitrous oxide was tapered to oxygen (O2) only 10 minutes following submucosal meperidine administration.", 
    "147": "Sixty-two children were evaluated who met the following criteria: (1) history of uncooperative behavior; (2) ASA I or II; (3) nothing to eat or drink after midnight the night before the appointment; (4) an initial/recall exam prior to the sedation appointment; and (4) patients who met the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry guidelines for sedation. Regimens I and II included 32 and 30 patients, respectively. A single clinician treated all patients. A Criticare monitor recorded the following at 5-minute intervals: (1) O2 saturation; (2) respiratory rate; (3) heart rate; (4) systolic and diastolic blood pressures; (5) end tidal carbon dioxide concentration; and (6) mean arterial blood pressure.", 
    "148": "The t test indicated significant differences between the 2 regimens for: (1) heart rate; (2) systolic blood pressure; and (3) diastolic blood pressure (regimen II had higher values).

    "151": "A treatment algorithm was implemented for patients accepted into an Early Psychosis Intervention Programme (EPIP) and the prescription patterns of these patients were compared with a comparator group (pre-EPIP) before the use of the algorithm. The prescribing pattern was established at 2 points: at baseline after the diagnosis was made, and 3 months later.", 
    "152": "There were 68 subjects in the comparator group and 483 EPIP patients; the latter were on the average younger. None in the comparator group was diagnosed to have an affective psychosis. There was a significant reduction in the rate of antipsychotic polypharmacy, prolonged use of benzodiazepines and anticholinergic medication in EPIP patients. This group also had an increase in the use of second-generation antipsychotics and received lower doses of antipsychotics.",

    "154": "Altered function of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) in dentate granule cells of the hippocampus has been associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in humans and in animal models of TLE. Such altered receptor function (including increased inhibition by zinc and lack of modulation by benzodiazepines) is related, in part, to changes in the mRNA levels of certain GABA(A)R subunits, including alpha4, and may play a role in epileptogenesis. The majority of GABA(A)Rs that contain alpha4 subunits are extra-synaptic due to lack of the gamma2 subunit and presence of delta. However, it has been hypothesized that seizure activity may result in expression of synaptic receptors with altered properties driven by an increased pool of alpha4 subunits. Results of our previous work suggests that signaling via protein kinase C (PKC) and early growth response factor 3 (Egr3) is the plasticity trigger for aberrant alpha4 subunit gene (GABRA4) expression after status epilepticus. We now report that brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the endogenous signal that induces Egr3 expression via a PKC/MAPK-dependent pathway. Taken together with the fact that blockade of tyrosine kinase (Trk) neurotrophin receptors reduces basal GABRA4 promoter activity by 50%, our findings support a role for BDNF as the mediator of Egr3-induced GABRA4 regulation in developing neurons and epilepsy and, moreover, suggest that BDNF may alter inhibitory processing in the brain by regulating the balance between phasic and tonic inhibition.", 
    "155": "The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key component of the limbic system, has been implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia because of its sensitivity to NMDA receptor antagonists. Recent studies have shown that the PCC is dysfunctional in schizophrenia, and it is now suspected to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Studies also suggest that there are abnormalities in muscarinic and GABAergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia. Therefore, in the present study we used quantitative autoradiography to investigate the binding of [(3)H]pirenzepine, [(3)H]AF-DX 384 and [(3)H]muscimol, which respectively label M1/4 and M2/4 muscarinic and GABA(A) receptors, in the PCC of schizophrenia and control subjects matched for age and post-mortem interval. The present study found that [(3)H]pirenzepine binding was significantly decreased in the superficial (-24%, p=0.002) and deep (-35%, p<0.001) layers of the PCC in the schizophrenia group as compared with the control group. In contrast, a dramatic increase in [(3)H]muscimol binding was observed in the superficial (+112%, p=0.001) and deep layers (+100%, p=0.017) of the PCC in the schizophrenia group. No difference was observed for [(3)H]AF-DX 384 binding between the schizophrenia and control groups. The authors found a significant inverse correlation between [(3)H]pirenzepine binding in the deep cortical layers and [(3)H]muscimol binding in the superficial layers (rho=-0.732, p=0.003). In addition, negative correlations were also found between age and [(3)H]pirenzepine binding in both superficial and deep cortical layers (rho=-0.669 p=0.049 and rho=-0.778, p=0.014), and between age of schizophrenia onset and [(3)H]AF-DX 384 binding (rho=-0.798, p=0.018). These results for the first time demonstrated the status of M1/M4, M2/M4 and GABA(A) receptors in the PCC in schizophrenia. Whilst the exact mechanism causing these alterations is not yet known, a possible increased acetylcholine and down regulated GABA stimulation in the PCC of schizophrenia is suggested.", 
    "156": "CFM-2 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-dimethoxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one] and THIQ-10c [N-acetyl-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline], are two non-competitive 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl) propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists, which demonstrated to antagonize generalized tonic-clonic seizures in different animal models. We have evaluated the effects of such compounds in a genetic animal model of absence epilepsy, the WAG/Rij rat. Animals were focally microinjected into specific brain areas of the cortico-thalamic circuit in order to evaluate the effects of these compounds on the number and duration of epileptic spike-wave discharges (SWDs) and better characterize the role of AMPA neurotransmission in this animal model. The focal microinjection of the two AMPA antagonists into some thalamic nuclei (ventralis posteromedialis (VPM), reticularis (NRT), ventralis posterolateralis (VPL) and the primary somatosensory forelimb region (S1FL)) was, generally, not able to significantly modify the occurrence of SWDs. Whereas, both compounds were able to reduce the number and duration of SWDs dose-dependently when microinjected into the peri-oral region of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1po). These findings suggest that AMPA receptor antagonists might play a role in absence epilepsies and that it might depend on the involvement of specific neuronal areas.", 
    "157": "Patients with neurologic disorders commonly experience sleep dysfunction and psychiatric disorders. The most common sleep dysfunction is insomnia, which is a primary symptom in 30% to 90% of psychiatric disorders. Insomnia and fatigue are prominent symptoms of anxiety disorders and major depression, including patients who are treated but have residual symptoms. Anxiety and depressive disorders account for 40% to 50% of all cases of chronic insomnia. It is also recognized that primary insomnia and other primary sleep disorders produce symptoms that are similar to those reported by patients with psychiatric disorders. A clinician must judge whether sleep deprivation causes mood disturbance or whether depressive or anxiety disorder represents the primary reason for sleep dysfunction. When insomnia is comorbid with mild to moderate depression, therapy should begin with bedtime dosing of sedating antidepressants such as mirtazapine, nefazodone, or tricyclic antidepressants, which are preferred because of their sedative effects, although side effects may limit their usefulness. Intervention for chronic insomnia is similar in nonpsychiatric and psychiatric patients. Behavioral therapies, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes show significant long-term efficacy as treatments for chronic insomnia. Sedative hypnotic agents are the most studied agents to treat insomnia, particularly those that are active through the benzodiazepine receptor-GABA complex, such as benzodiazepines, eszopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem. The new melatonin-receptor agonist ramelteon has not yet been studied in psychiatric patients. Prescription of adjunctive trazodone 50 to 150 mg is a common clinical practice to treat comorbid insomnia during antidepressant therapy, but published data are surprisingly limited when considered against the frequent usage of trazodone. Although there has been insufficient research on the use of atypical antipsychotic agents in severe insomnia, psychiatrists use quetiapine, olanzapine, or other agents to lessen agitation that disrupts sleep onset or maintenance. When insomnia or hypersomnia continues even as mood, anxiety, or thought disorders improve with standard therapy, the physician should consider the potential presence of underlying sleep disorders.", 
    "158": "A bovine alpha s1-casein tryptic hydrolysate was previously demonstrated to display an anxiolytic-like activity in the conditioned defensive burying and in the elevated plus-maze models when i.p. injected. The present study assessed the anxiolytic-like effects of this tryptic hydrolysate after an oral administration in rats faced to the same behavioural situations using diazepam as a reference. In a first experiment, the behavioural effects of the hydrolysate in the conditioned defensive burying test were investigated at doses ranging 5-50 mg/kg. The results showed that the minimal dose required to elicit an anxiolytic-like activity is 15 mg/kg. In a second experiment, the alpha s1-casein tryptic hydrolysate (15 mg/kg, p.o.) was demonstrated to display an anxiolytic-like activity similar to diazepam (3 mg/kg, p.o.) in the conditioned defensive burying test and the elevated plus-maze. However, the ethological analysis of behaviour indicated that this hydrolysate has a different activity compared to diazepam. While diazepam induced a disinhibition state in rats, possibly related to the risk-taking behaviour observed after a benzodiazepine ingestion in humans, the tryptic hydrolysate did not display such a side effect. These results suggest that the mechanism of action of the bovine alpha s1-casein tryptic hydrolysate may differ from that of diazepam.", 
    "159": "To assess the characteristics, clinical significance and pathology of Restless legs syndrome (RLS) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), we studied clinical backgrounds, RLS symptoms, polysomnographic (PSG) variables and therapeutic outcomes in 13 PD patients with RLS (pRLS), and compared them with those of 22 idiopathic RLS patients (iRLS). In all but one pRLS patient, RLS symptoms arose within 5 years of PD onset. pRLS patients had a lower prevalence of family history of RLS, and the age at onset was higher than in iRLS subjects. Scores for the severity scale established by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the suggested immobilization test did not differ between groups. However, the periodic limb movements index measured by polysomnogram was smaller in pRLS subjects. After RLS treatment, symptoms improved significantly in both groups; however, pRLS subjects showed higher IRLS scores despite receiving similar doses of RLS medications. The severity of RLS before treatment was quite similar between the two groups, but the response to treatment could be poorer in pRLS than in iRLS. Thus, degeneration of the diencephalospinal dopaminergic pathway due to PD itself and physiological aging could overlap in the pathology of pRLS.", 
    "160": "We describe a fulminant picture of anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) and the possible role of nitrazepam. A 5-month-old boy developed fever and rash after the use of phenobarbitone. Allergy to phenobarbitone was suspected. Nitrazepam was substituted for seizure control. Over the next few days he progressively collapsed with fever, facial oedema and multi-organ involvement. The diagnosis of AHS was delayed because nitrazepam has not been implicated in the development of cross-sensitivity. AHS is a severe multi-organ reaction to aromatic anti-epileptic drugs. It has been thought to occur as a consequence of pre-existing pharmacogenetic and immunologic abnormalities. Careful selection of anti-epileptic drugs is essential as cross-sensitivity is common. Intermittent benzodiazepines have been recommended in managing breakthrough seizures in AHS. However, the structure of benzodiazepines contains aromatic rings and potential cross-reactivity cannot be totally ignored. Although we do not have direct proof, we believe that nitrazepam prolonged the clinical course.", 
    "161": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disease with good prognosis, which is diagnosed by exclusion of possible causative organic diseases. However, since the patients tend to have strong psychotic symptoms including anxiety, tension, depression, irritation and insomnia, this syndrome has to be elucidated as a psychosomatic disease. Although the symptoms are usually limited to gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and abnormal bowel movements, many patients also manifest some kinds of psychiatric abnormalities such as hypochondria, depression, hysteria, panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Especially, the prevalence of depression is high. Therefore, use of psychotropic drugs is efficient in treating IBS. Antidepressant agents including tricyclic agents such as amitriptyline, trimipramine, imipramine, clomipramine, amoxapine and nortriptyline; tetracyclic antidepressant; antidepressants such as SSRI and SNRI; sulpiride; benzodiazepine class anxiolytic agents; tandospirone; and Chinese herbal medicine are being used. IBS is a stress-related disease. Therefore, in spite of the importance of pharmacotherapy, patients should also be instructed to avoid the stress that aggravates the symptoms in all aspects of daily life.", 
    "162": "Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is an acronym that identifies a new clinico-neuroradiologic entity occurring in association with different conditions. We report a patient with eclamptic encephalopathy whose clinico-radiological picture normalised after prompt treatment. We suggest defining this condition as potentially RES, to emphasise that reversibility is not spontaneous but is usually related to an adequate treatment, and that the posterior localisation of the lesions, even if constant, may not represent the most relevant finding in some patients.", 
    "163": "We experienced anesthetic management for an operation to remove a hemorrhagic gastric submucosal tumor in a patient who had undergone left ventricular volume reduction (the Batista procedure) for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) 2 years previously. Preoperative evaluations indicated the relapse of severe DCM. Intravenous and epidural anesthesia was employed with the aid of an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP). Safe anesthetic management was achieved under the guidance of a Swan-Ganz catheter without inducing overreduction of afterload or excessive preload.", 
    "164": "Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) is sometimes associated with coronary artery anomalies, including right ventricle (RV)-to-coronary artery fistulas (sinusoidal communications), coronary artery stenoses, and coronary artery occlusions. In some cases, the coronary circulation depends entirely or partly on the desaturated systemic venous blood supply from the RV. Under these circumstances, decompression of the RV can result in fatal myocardial ischemia. A 6-month-old boy, diagnosed with PAIVS associated with sinusoidal communications, underwent a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt procedure under venoarterial cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). During CPB, to prevent RV decompression, we maintained right atrial pressure above 5 mmHg and used a pump perfusion rate of 30%-40% of the calculated value based on body surface area. Although electrocardiography showed slight ST depression and bradycardia, myocardial contractility after weaning from CPB was adequate to maintain the circulation with the administration of dobutamine and atrial pacing. In patients with PAIVS and RV-dependent coronary circulation, it is important to maintain coronary artery perfusion throughout the period of anesthesia."
