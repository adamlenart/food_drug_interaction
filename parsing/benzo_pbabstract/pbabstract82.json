Results indicate that 32 per cent of respondents took a mean daily dose of 6.1 mg of equivalent diazepam for, on average, 205 days per year. Almost half (48%) of Bzs users received a potentially inappropriate benzodiazepine prescription at least once during the year preceding the survey. About 23 per cent received at least one concomitant prescription of a Bz and another drug that could result in serious interaction. In addition, individuals aged 75 and older were more likely to receive Bzs for a longer period of time than those aged 65-74. Number of pharmacies used was associated with inappropriate Bzs prescriptions. Our results argue in favour of a more integrated health services system, including a regular review of older adults' drug regimens.",

    "2": "Using an in-house forensic toxicology database, we selected 1000 cases of driving under the influence of drugs (DUIDs) over a 12-month period if diazepam (D) and nordiazepam (ND) were both present in the blood samples. Quantitative analysis of D and ND in blood was done by solvent extraction (butyl acetate) and capillary column gas chromatography (GC) with a nitrogen-phosphorous (N-P) detector. The limits of quantitation of this analytical method for D and ND in blood were 0.05 mg/L. The correlation between D and ND concentrations in blood was statistically significant (r = .58, P < .001), as expected for a parent drug and its primary metabolite. However, the frequency distributions were markedly skewed to the right with mean (median) and highest concentrations of 0.37 (0.20) and 6.1 mg/L for D and 0.39 (0.20) and 5.6 mg/L for ND. The mean (median) total concentration (D + ND) was 0.76 mg/L (0.50 mg/L), and the concentration ratios D/ND and ND/D were 1.29 (median 0.95) and 1.41 (median 1.06), respectively. In 90 cases (9%), the concentration of D in blood exceeded 0.83 mg/L, which corresponds to an upper therapeutic limit in plasma (\u223c1.5 mg/L), assuming a plasma/blood distribution ratio of 1.8:1.",

Cognitive deficits of schizophrenia have been attributed to reduced function of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor or reduced expression of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase-67, which presumably leads to attenuated neurotransmission at GABA(A) receptors.",

The current study focuses on daily hassles, which by their chronic and accumulating nature can cause considerable psychosocial stress. The main aim was to investigate the frequency, associated distress and type of daily hassles encountered by Dutch MS patients from a large community-based sample. We further examined factors associated with high levels of psychosocial stress. Questionnaires concerning demographics, disease characteristics, physical functioning, daily hassles, fatigue, depression and anxiety were completed by 718 MS patients. Three patients younger than 18 were excluded, resulting in 715 patients. Compared with published norm data, more than 50% of the participants reported a high number of daily hassles (57.5%) and high levels of associated distress (55.7%). Frequently mentioned daily hassles concern personal functioning and social developments. A logistic regression model revealed that being female, being younger, having a higher educational level, using benzodiazepines, exhibiting more symptoms of anxiety, and a higher physical impact of fatigue were all independently associated with high levels of psychosocial stress. Our findings may alert clinicians of the high prevalence and impact of daily hassles in MS and underline the need to incorporate stress and anxiety management strategies in (psycho)therapeutic interventions.",

Patients were divided into two groups for study purposes: the dexmedetomidine group (n = 52) included patients who received a dexmedetomidine infusion along with other conventional sedation agents, and the control group (n = 42) included patients who received conventional sedation agents without the use of dexmedetomidine. Clinical outcomes evaluated in our study included days of mechanical ventilation, cardiovascular intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, and mortality. To evaluate the safety of dexmedetomidine, we collected physiologic data, including heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, systemic oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, and inotrope score. To assess the efficacy of dexmedetomidine, we examined the amount and duration of concomitant sedation and analgesic infusions over a period of 24 hrs in both dexmedetomidine and control groups. We also examined the number of rescue boluses for each category prior to the initiation of sedative infusion, during the sedative infusion, and after the termination of the sedative infusion.

The duration and amount of continuous midazolam and morphine infusions were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group when compared to the control group. During dexmedetomidine infusion, there was no statistical difference in the heart rate and blood pressure between the two groups. Inotrope score was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group as compared to the control group in the last 6 hrs prior to termination of dexmedetomidine infusion (p < .001), and at 1 hr (p < .001) and 6 hrs (p < .001) after termination of dexmedetomidine infusion. There was no difference in duration of mechanical ventilation (p = .77), cardiovascular intensive care unit length of stay (p = .29), or hospital length of stay (p = .43) in the two groups.

The satiating effect of the potato extract was compared in the present study to other protein sources, and the involvement of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion was examined. Food consumption was measured in 18-h fasted rats after oral gavage of the potato extract or other protein sources. The CCK-releasing activity of the potato extract was then examined in anesthetized rats with a portal cannula. Oral gavage of the potato extract reduced the food intake in the rats, the effect being greater than with casein and a soybean \u03b2-conglycinin hydrolysate. The suppressive effect on appetite of the potato extract was attenuated by treating with a CCK-receptor antagonist (devazepide). The portal CCK concentration was increased after a duodenal administration of the potato extract to anesthetized rats. These results indicate that the potato extract suppressed the food intake in rats through CCK secretion.", 
    "37": "A simple and rapid LC/MS method with direct injection analysis was developed and validated for the identification and quantification of ten benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, nordiazepam, diazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, flurazepam, bromazepam, midazolam, alprazolam, temazepam and oxazepam) in human urine using diazepam-d5 as internal standard (IS). The main advantage of the proposed methodology is the minimal sample preparation procedure, as diluted urine samples were directly injected into LC/MS system. Electrospray ionization in positive mode using selected ion monitoring was chosen for the identification and quantification of the analytes. The linear range was 50-1000 ng/mL for each analyte, with square correlation coefficient (r(2))\u22650.981. Interday and intraday errors were found to be \u22645.72%. The LC/MS method was applied at ten real samples found initially to be positive and negative, using immunoassay technique. Finally the results were confirmed with GC/MS. The method demonstrates simplicity and fast sample preparation, accuracy and specificity of the analytes which make it suitable for replacement of immunoassay screening in urine avoiding thus false negative/false positive results. Using this method, laboratories may overcome the problem of high cost instrumentation such as LC-MS/MS by providing similar sensitivity and specificity with other methods.", 
    "38": "Functional studies have shown altered cholinergic mechanisms in the inflamed bladder, which partly depend on muscarinic receptor-induced release of nitric oxide (NO). The current study aimed to characterize which muscarinic receptor subtypes that are involved in the regulation of the nitrergic effects in the bladder cholinergic response during cystitis. For this purpose, in vitro examinations of carbachol-evoked contractions of inflamed and normal bladder preparations were performed. The effects of antagonists with different selectivity for the receptor subtypes were assessed on intact and urothelium-denuded bladder preparations. In preparations from cyclophosphamide (CYP; in order to induce cystitis) pre-treated rats, the response to carbachol was about 75% of that of normal preparations. Removal of the urothelium or administration of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor re-established the responses in the inflamed preparations. Administration of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) inhibited the carbachol-induced contractile responses of preparations from CYP pre-treated rats less potently than controls. Pirenzepine and p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-diphenidol (pFHHSiD) affected the carbachol-induced contractile responses to similar extents in preparations of CYP pre-treated and control rats. However, the Schild slopes for the three antagonists were all significantly different from unity in the preparations from CYP pre-treated rats. Again, L-NNA or removal of the urothelium eliminated any difference compared to normal preparations. This study confirms that muscarinic receptor stimulation in the inflamed rat urinary bladder induces urothelial release of NO, which counteracts detrusor contraction.", 
    "39": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a leading cause of liver failure and an important safety issue in drug development. Thalidomide is nowadays used for the treatment of several conditions including multiple myeloma (MM). Several adverse effects have been described but liver toxicity was seldom reported. We describe a case of thalidomide-induced hepatitis in a man treated for MM. The clinical setting and temporal association between the start of the drug and liver injury allowed the assumption of the causative role of thalidomide. As its clinical indications expand we wish to increase awareness of a new potential side effect of thalidomide. A short review on thalidomide-induced liver injury is also presented.", 
    "40": "Melatonin (MLT) is a neurohormone known to be involved in the regulation of anxiety. Most of the physiological actions of MLT in the brain are mediated by two high-affinity G-protein-coupled receptors, denoted MT(1) and MT(2). However, the particular role of these receptors in anxiety remains to be defined. Here we used a novel MT(2)-selective partial agonist, UCM765 to evaluate the involvement of MT(2) receptors in anxiety. Adult male rats were acutely injected with UCM765 (5-10-20mg/kg), MLT (20mg/kg) or diazepam (DZ, 1mg/kg). Anxiety-related behaviors were assessed in the elevated plus maze test (EPMT), novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and open field test (OFT). UCM765 at the dose of 10mg/kg showed anxiolytic-like properties by increasing the time spent in the open arm of the EPMT, and by reducing the latency to eat in a novel environment in the NSFT. In the EPMT, animals treated with UCM765 (10mg/kg) or MLT (20mg/kg) spent more time in the open arms compared to vehicle-treated animals, but to a lesser extent compared to DZ (1mg/kg). In the NSFT, all treatments similarly decreased the latency to eat in a novel environment compared to vehicle. UCM765 and MLT did not affect the total time and the number of entries into the central area of the OFT, but unlike DZ, did not impair locomotion. The anxiolytic effects of UCM765 and MLT in the EPMT and the NSFT were blocked using a pre-treatment with the MT(1)/MT(2) antagonist luzindole (10mg/kg) or the MT(2) antagonist 4P-PDOT (10mg/kg). These results demonstrated, for the first time, the anxiolytic properties of UCM765 and suggest that MT(2)-receptors may be considered a novel target for the development of anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "41": "Ketoconazole is recognized as the prototypical CYP3A inhibitor and is often used to determine the metabolic CYP3A liabilities of new chemical entities in preclinical and clinical studies. Ketoconazole has been commercially available for approximately 30 years and was marketed before drug-metabolizing enzymes were well characterized; consequently, little is known about its metabolic profile. Semagacestat, a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor investigated as a potential therapy for Alzheimer's disease, was determined to be a potent CYP3A autoinducer in human hepatocytes. Two human studies were conducted to assess the induction potential of semagacestat. In the first study (study 1, n = 20), semagacestat increased the mean apparent clearance (CL/F) of oral midazolam (76-324 l/h) and nifedipine (63-229 l/h) as predicted from hepatocytes. In a second (steady-state) study (study 2, n = 20), semagacestat CL/F increased from 22 after a single dose to 31 l/h. Ketoconazole decreased semagacestat CL/F by 32% after a single dose of semagacestat [geometric means ratio estimate, 0.68; 90% confidence interval (CI). 0.64, 0.73] and 46% at steady state (geometric means ratio estimate. 0.54; 90% CI, 0.51, 0.58). Ketoconazole area under the concentration-time curve over 8 h decreased 49% from first to last day of semagacestat dosing. Semagacestat significantly increases the oral clearance of CYP3A substrates, confirming its inducer designation. More importantly, when administered with a potent CYP3A inducer at steady state, ketoconazole's plasma exposure decreased, indicating that it may also be cleared by CYP3A, other inducible enzymes or transporters, or both.", 
    "42": "Prolonged or recurrent seizures that result in significant morbidity and mortality are referred to as status epilepticus (SE). Benzodiazepines, which are positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors, are effective agents for treating SE; however, they become ineffective when seizures are prolonged. This is in part due to seizure-induced plasticity of synaptic GABAA receptors present on principal neurons of the hippocampus. There is post-translational modification and altered trafficking of synaptic receptors during SE whereas the function of extrasynaptic receptors is preserved. Novel therapies of SE could be designed to target synaptic receptor trafficking or extrasynaptic GABAA receptors.", 
    "43": "Chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) treatment and withdrawal in rats produces behavioral changes modeling human alcohol dependence including increased seizure susceptibility, which are associated with long-lasting changes in inhibitory neurotransmission involving the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors (GABAR). The propensity for dependence on alcohol involves both brain reward mechanisms and the withdrawal syndrome, leading to increased consumption. The withdrawal syndrome includes hyperactivity and hyperexcitability, increased anxiety, sleep disorders, including tolerance to sedative actions of ethanol and other sleep aids, and increased seizure susceptibility. Using a rat model of alcohol dependence involving CIE administration with multiple episodes of intoxication and withdrawal, we deduced that multiple withdrawals produce a kindling-like phenomenon. We also demonstrated that behavioral changes are induced by one dose of ethanol (5 g/kg, gavage) in rats and result from changes in subunit composition, subcellular location, pharmacology and function of GABARs. Ethanol (EtOH)-sensitive extrasynaptic \u03b14/\u03b4-containing GABAR-mediated tonic inhibitory currents are rapidly down-regulated, followed by a slower down-regulation of benzodiazepine (BZ)-sensitive \u03b11/\u03b32-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents and increased compensatory \u03b14/\u03b32 synaptic GABAR currents in parallel with increased sensitivity to low millimolar (mM) concentrations of EtOH. While these changes are transient and normalize in a few days, CIE treatment (>30 doses) makes this remodeling of GABAR persistent. We conclude that GABAR plasticity is essential to development of EtOH dependence including seizure susceptibility, and may provide a possible model of epileptogenesis in mammalian brain.", 
    "44": "Kainate (KA) receptors are expressed widely in the central nervous system and regulate both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. KA receptors play important roles in fear memory, anxiety, and pain. However, little is known about their function in synaptic transmission in the insular cortex (IC), a critical region for taste, memory, and pain. Using whole cell patch-clamp recordings, we have shown that KA receptors contribute to fast synaptic transmission in neurons in all layers of the IC. In the presence of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin, the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5, and the selective AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 53655, KA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (KA EPSCs) were revealed. We found that KA EPSCs are ~5-10% of AMPA/KA EPSCs in all layers of the adult mouse IC. Similar results were found in adult rat IC. KA EPSCs had a significantly slower rise time course and decay time constant compared with AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs. High-frequency repetitive stimulations at 200 Hz significantly facilitated the summation of KA EPSCs. In addition, genetic deletion of GluK1 or GluK2 subunit partially reduced postsynaptic KA EPSCs, and exposure of GluK2 knockout mice to the selective GluK1 antagonist UBP 302 could significantly reduce the KA EPSCs. These data suggest that both GluK1 and GluK2 play functional roles in the IC. Our study may provide the synaptic basis for the physiology and pathology of KA receptors in the IC-related functions.",

This aspect of side effect overlap between the combined agents was often reflected in similar or higher dropout rates for the combination and may thus substantially limit the utility of such drug combinations. Meta-analysis was possible for only one comparison of only one combination, i.e. gabapentin + opioid versus gabapentin alone. This meta-analysis involving 386 participants from two studies demonstrated modest, yet statistically significant, superiority of a gabapentin + opioid combination over gabapentin alone. However, this combination also produced significantly more frequent side effect-related trial dropouts compared to gabapentin alone.", 
    "55": "Multiple, good-quality studies demonstrate superior efficacy of two-drug combinations. However, the number of available studies for any one specific combination, as well as other study factors (e.g. limited trial size and duration), preclude the recommendation of any one specific drug combination for neuropathic pain. Demonstration of combination benefits by several studies together with reports of widespread clinical polypharmacy for neuropathic pain surely provide a rationale for additional future rigorous evaluations. In order to properly identify specific drug combinations which provide superior efficacy and/or safety, we recommend that future neuropathic pain studies of two-drug combinations include comparisons with placebo and both single-agent components. Given the apparent adverse impact of combining agents with similar adverse effect profiles (e.g. CNS depression), the anticipated development and availability of non-sedating neuropathic pain agents could lead to the identification of more favourable analgesic drug combinations in which side effects are not compounded.",

The typical duration of the studies was four to six weeks. We considered six studies to have a high risk of bias.When alprazolam was compared with placebo for reduction in symptoms all estimates indicated a positive effect for alprazolam. Pooled estimates of efficacy data showed a moderately large continuous mean difference (MD) at the end of trial (-5.34, 95% CI -7.48 to -3.20; I(2) = 68%). The risk difference (RD) for the dichotomous measure of clinical response (50% improvement) was 0.32 in favour of alprazolam (95% CI 0.22 to 0.42; I(2) = 0%), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 3 (95% CI 2 to 5).

    "63": "Impulsive choice is often examined using a delay-discounting procedure, where there is a choice between two reinforcers of different magnitudes presented at varying delays. Individual discounting rates can be influenced by many factors including strain differences and drug effects. Lewis (LEW) and Fischer 344 (F344) rats have behavioral and neurochemical differences relevant to delay discounting and were used to examine effects of acute and chronic administration of diazepam on impulsive choice. Consistent with the previous literature, larger-reinforcer choice decreased as a function of increasing delays for all rats, and steeper discounting functions were obtained for LEW relative to F344 rats. Acute and chronic administration of diazepam resulted in differential effects between rat strains and sometimes between subjects within the same rat strain. Overall, larger-reinforcer choice remained unchanged across multiple phases of the experiment for LEW rats. For F344 rats, larger-reinforcer choice increased following the acute administration of smaller doses of diazepam and decreased following the acute administration of the largest dose tested. Decreases in larger-reinforcer choice occurred for F344 rats during chronic and postchronic administration and persisted throughout a nondrug return-to-baseline phase. These results suggest potential directions for future investigation of environmental, genetic, and neurochemical variables involved in delay discounting.",

The paper is otherwise identical to the previously published paper. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that have assessed the risk of accident associated with the use of drugs when driving is presented. The meta-analysis included 66 studies containing a total of 264 estimates of the effects on accident risk of using illicit or prescribed drugs when driving. Summary estimates of the odds ratio of accident involvement are presented for amphetamines, analgesics, anti-asthmatics, anti-depressives, anti-histamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, opiates, penicillin and zopiclone (a sleeping pill). For most of the drugs, small or moderate increases in accident risk associated with the use of the drugs were found. Information about whether the drugs were actually used while driving and about the doses used was often imprecise. Most studies that have evaluated the presence of a dose-response relationship between the dose of drugs taken and the effects on accident risk confirm the existence of a dose-response relationship. Use of drugs while driving tends to have a larger effect on the risk of fatal and serious injury accidents than on the risk of less serious accidents (usually property-damage-only accidents). The quality of the studies that have assessed risk varied greatly. There was a tendency for the estimated effects of drug use on accident risk to be smaller in well-controlled studies than in poorly controlled studies. Evidence of publication bias was found for some drugs. The associations found cannot be interpreted as causal relationships, principally because most studies do not control very well for potentially confounding factors.",

Tics may be simple or complex, and may include motor and vocal components. Abnormal function of the basal ganglia is thought to be an important underlying cause of tics and other movement disorders. Treatment of TS requires a thorough understanding of the phenomenology of the disease for the individual patient, and should focus on symptoms that are especially troubling. Some nonpharmacologic approaches may help to improve tic severity, including conditioning techniques, relaxation training, and hypnosis. Options for pharmacotherapy include dopamine blockers and depleters, benzodiazepines, central alpha-adrenergic blockers, and botulinum toxin. Many patients require therapy for comorbid conditions such as anxiety, depression, or ADHD. In case studies and small patient series, deep brain stimulation has been shown to markedly reduce tic severity and functional impairment associated with TS. While onset is most frequently in childhood, TS should not be considered exclusively a disorder of pediatric patients. The complications and comorbidities that are encountered in children and adolescents often persist into adulthood.",

Chorea may occur in several neurodegenerative, genetic, or drug-related conditions, and a thorough diagnostic evaluation is needed to identify the specific underlying causes. Some choreic disorders have specific treatable underlying etiologies, such as vitamin B(12) deficiency or drug-induced dyskinesia. Autoimmune disorders such as Sydenham chorea may be treated with penicillin, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange. Heredodegenerative choreas such as Huntington disease often respond to treatment with tetrabenazine or amantadine. Many other agents may be used nonspecifically for symptom control, including benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and antiepileptic medications. In addition to motor symptoms, patients with Huntington disease or other choreic disorders often experience increasing depression, bradykinesia, cognitive impairment, aggressive behaviors, and other complications as the disease progresses. Caring for the caregiver is also a significant concern in the long-term treatment of choreic disorders.",

Blood oxygenation level dependent activation in response to negative image anticipation is also sensitive to anxiolytic treatment, suggesting that image anticipation probes anxiety systems.

    "95": "Laboratory mice typically are anesthetized by either inhalation of volatile anesthetics or injection of drugs. Here we compared the acute and postanesthetic effects of combining both methods with standard inhalant monoanesthesia using sevoflurane in mice. After injection of fentanyl-midazolam or S-ketamine as premedication, a standard 50-min anesthesia was conducted by using sevoflurane. Addition of fentanyl-midazolam (0.04 mg/kg-4 mg/kg) induced sedation, attenuation of aversive behaviors at induction, shortening of the induction phase, and reduced the sevoflurane concentration required by one third (3.3% compared with 5%), compared with S-ketamine (30 mg/kg) premedication or sevoflurane alone. During anesthesia, heart rate and core body temperature were depressed significantly by both premedications but in general remained within normal ranges. In contrast, with or without premedication, substantial respiratory depression was evident, with a marked decline in respiratory rate accompanied by hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis. Arrhythmia, apnea, and occasionally death occurred under S-ketamine-sevoflurane. Postanesthetic telemetric measurements showed unchanged locomotor activity but elevated heart rate and core body temperature at 12 h; these changes were most prominent during sevoflurane monoanesthesia and least pronounced or absent during fentanyl-midazolam-sevoflurane. In conclusion, combining injectable and inhalant anesthetics in mice can be advantageous compared with inhalation monoanesthesia at induction and postanesthetically. However, adverse physiologic side effects during anesthesia can be exacerbated by premedications, requiring careful selection of drugs and dosages.", 
    "96": "Pharmacological control of seizure activity following nerve agent exposure is critical in reducing neuropathology and improving survival in casualties. Three classes of drugs, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines and excitatory amino acid (EAA) antagonists, have been shown to be effective at moderating nerve agent-induced seizures. However, little is known about which brain structures are involved in producing the anticonvulsant response. This study evaluated drugs from each class, injected directly into one of three specific brain structures, the perirhinal cortex, the entorhinal cortex, or the mediodorsal thalamus, for their ability to modulate seizures induced by the nerve agent soman. The drugs evaluated were the anticholinergic scopolamine, the benzodiazepine midazolam, and the EAA antagonist MK-801. For each drug treatment in each brain area, anticonvulsant ED\u2085\u2080 values were calculated using an up-down dosing procedure over successive animals. There was no statistical difference in the anticonvulsant ED\u2085\u2080 values for scopolamine and MK-801 in the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices. MK-801 pretreatment in the mediodorsal thalamus had a significantly lower anticonvulsant ED\u2085\u2080 value than any other treatment/injection site combination. Midazolam required significantly higher doses than scopolamine and MK-801 in the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices to produce an anticonvulsant response and was ineffective in the mediodorsal thalamus. These findings support the contention that specific neuroanatomical pathways are activated during nerve agentinduced seizures and that the discrete brain structures involved have unique pharmacological thresholds for producing an anticonvulsant response. This study is also the first to show the involvement of the mediodorsal thalamus in the control of nerve agent-induced seizures.",

Morphine sulfate (0.05 mg/kg) was administered to all patients for relief of postoperative pain. In one group, sedative infusion was started with 1 mg/h of haloperidol plus 25 \u03bcg/kg/min of propofol after bolus injection of 2 mg haloperidol. In the other group, midazolam1 mg/h and propofol 25 \u03bcg/kg/min were infused after a bolus injection of 2 mg midazolam. Propofol infusion was adjusted to keep bi-spectral index between 61-80 and the RSS between 3-5. Hourly propofol consumption was recorded during 24 h of sedation and compared statistically. We also compared SpO 2 , arterial blood gas variables, hemodynamic parameters and episodes of respiratory depression (SpO 2 \u226485%) requiring respiratory support between the groups. Haloperidol, when added to propofol infusion, decreased its consumption at all the measured times (P = 0.001). There was no significant difference in hemodynamic variables between two groups, but the episodes of respiratory depression was significantly higher in propofol-midazolam group (P = 0.02). We conclude that haloperidol-propofol infusion decreases propofol requirements in the agitated patients. Besides, this combination showed a better profile in terms of occurrence of respiratory depression.",

However, half of all human tumors expresses wild-type p53, and its activation, by antagonizing its negative regulator Mdm2, might offer a new strategy for therapeutic protocol. In this work, we present a molecular dynamics study on Mdm2 structure bound to two different known inhibitors with the aim to investigate the structural transitions between apo-Mdm2 and Mdm2-inhibitor complexes. We tried to gain information about conformational changes binding a benzodiazepine derivative inhibitor with respect the known nutlin and the apo form. The conformational changes alter the size of the cleft and were mainly in the linker regions, suggesting that the overall dynamic nature of Mdm2 is related to dynamic movements in these regions.", 
    "107": "Magnolol (6,6',7,12-tetramethoxy-2,2'-dimethyl-1-beta-berbaman, C(18)H(18)O(2)), an active ingredient of the bark of Magnolia officinalis, has been reported to exert potent anti-epileptic effects via the GABA(A) receptor. The receptor also mediates sleep in humans and animals. The aim of this study was to determine whether magnolol could modulate sleep behaviors by recording EEG and electromyogram in mice. The results showed that magnolol administered i.p. at a dose of 5 or 25 mg/kg could significantly shorten the sleep latency, increase the amount of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep for 3 h after administration with an increase in the number of NREM and REM sleep episodes. Magnolol at doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg increased the number of bouts of wakefulness but decreased their duration. On the other hand, magnolol increased the number of state transitions from wakefulness to NREM sleep and subsequently from NREM sleep to wakefulness. Immunohistochemical study showed that magnolol increased c-Fos expression in the neurons of ventrolateral preoptic area, a sleep center in the anterior hypothalamus, and decreased c-Fos expression in the arousal tuberomammillary nucleus, which was located in the caudolateral hypothalamus. The sleep-promoting effects and changes in c-Fos induced by magnolol were reversed by flumazenil, an antagonist at the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor. These results indicate that magnolol increased NREM and REM sleep via the GABA(A) receptor.",

Incomplete bowel obstruction is one of the leading causes of nausea and vomiting, which may result in a substantial impairment to quality of life. We explored the antiemetic activity of olanzapine against nausea and vomiting in cancer patients with incomplete bowel obstruction. This retrospective study was carried out on a palliative care unit, using an electronic medical record from 2007 to 2009. The intensity of the symptom was evaluated and classified from the medical records on four scales. The frequency of vomiting also was noted from the medical records. During this study period, 20 patients met the inclusion criteria. The average dose of olanzapine was 4.9\u00b11.2mg and treatment duration was 23.4\u00b116.2 days. Olanzapine treatment led to a significant decrease in the average intensity score of nausea from 2.4\u00b10.7 to 0.2\u00b10.4 (P<0.001). Of the 20 patients, 18 (90%) experienced a reduction in the intensity of nausea. The average frequency of vomiting significantly decreased after olanzapine treatment from 1.1\u00b11.3 times/day (median 0.5; range 0-4) before the treatment to 0.3\u00b10.5 times/day (median 0; range 0-1) after the treatment (P<0.01). Before the treatment, 10 patients experienced vomiting; eight of these patients experienced a decrease in the frequency of vomiting with olanzapine treatment. Our study suggests the potential efficacy of olanzapine for relief of nausea in incomplete bowel obstruction. A prospective trial is promising.",

The method includes most of the commonly used and abused drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and opioids. Chromatographic separation of the targeted drugs was achieved using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC coupled to a Waters Micromass LCT Premier XE time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The total chromatographic run time was 13.5 min injection to injection. The estimated method LOQ is in the range of 0.06-27 ng/g, which is below the therapeutic levels for each of the drugs analyzed but LSD. The extraction recovery ranged from 6% to 197% with median value 95% and mean value 82%. Matrix effect ranged from 81% suppression to 29% enhancement of the signals compared to signals obtained in the absence of biological matrix. The method was tested on 55 authentic forensic toxicology samples confirming the same positive results as found using the routine analytical procedures as well as some additional compounds. Recently there has been considerable attention paid to drug-facilitated sexual assault and the toxicological findings in these cases. As part of a pilot study to investigate the prevalence of medicinal drugs, drugs of abuse, and alcohol in victims of alleged sexual assault, biological specimens were obtained from 167 victims being examined at the Sexual Assault Center in Aarhus, Denmark. The obtained blood samples were analyzed using the novel screening method supported by additional analyses for e.g. THC and alcohol. 124 victims reported they have been drinking alcohol prior to the assault (74%). Alcohol analyses revealed 59 positive findings (48%). 35 of the cases were found positive for one or more drugs excluding alcohol (21%). 20 of the victims reported they have been subject to a drug-facilitated sexual assault (12%). For the victims suspecting drug-facilitated sexual assault, the toxicological analyses revealed four positive for alcohol and nine victims were positive for one or more drugs, with six of the victims found positive for benzodiazepines or other drugs with sedative effects. It was notable that victims tested positive for medicinal drugs and drugs of abuse as well as victims of alleged drug-facilitated sexual assault in average underwent medical examination later than the whole study population.",

    "123": "Chronic stress has been reported to decrease bone density and intestinal calcium absorption, but its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Since long-term exposure to glucocorticoids, major stress hormones from adrenal gland, is known to downregulate the mRNA expression of intestinal calcium transporter TRPV6, the present study aimed to demonstrate whether decreases in mRNA expressions of duodenal calcium transporter genes were observed in male rats subjected to restraint stress for 4 weeks. The results from quantitative real-time PCR showed that restraint stress significantly downregulated the mRNA expressions of apical calcium channels (TRPV6 and Ca(v)1.3), cytoplasmic calcium-binding protein (calbindin-D(9k)), and basolateral calcium pump (PMCA(1b)), but not the expression of TRPV5 or NCX1. The mRNA expressions of paracellular genes, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-3, were not altered by restraint stress. Since several antidepressant or anxiolytic drugs effectively alleviate stress-induced depressive and anxiety symptoms, we further hypothesized that these drugs may also enhance calcium transporter gene expression in stressed rats. As expected, 4-week daily administration of 10 mg/kg fluoxetine, 10 mg/kg reboxetine, or 10 mg/kg venlafaxine differentially increased calcium transporter mRNA expression in stressed rats, whereas 2 mg/kg diazepam had no such effect. It could, therefore, be concluded that 4-week restraint stress downregulated some important calcium transporter mRNA expression in the duodenal epithelial cells of male rats, which could be prevented by oral administration of fluoxetine, reboxetine, and venlafaxine. The present findings may be applied to help alleviate the stress-induced bone loss and osteoporosis by restoring intestinal calcium absorption to provide calcium for bone formation.", 
    "124": "The purpose of this work was to develop and optimize a simple and suitable method to detect the potential inhibitory effect of drugs and medicines on alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity in order to evaluate the possible interactions between medicines and alcohol metabolism. Commonly used medicines that are often involved in court litigations related with driving under the influence of alcohol were selected. Alprazolam, flunitrazepam and tramadol were tested as drugs with no known effect on ADH activity. Cimetidine, reported previously as having inhibitory effect on ADH, and 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), a well known ADH inhibitor, were tested as positive controls. Apart from 4-MP, tramadol was identified as having the higher inhibitory effect with an IC50 of 44.7 \u00d7 10(-3)mM, followed by cimetidine (IC50 of 122.9 \u00d7 10(-3)mM). Alprazolam and flunitrazepam also reduced liver ADH activity but to a smaller extent (inhibition of 11.8 \u00b1 5.0% for alprazolam 1.0mM and 34.5 \u00b1 7.1% for flunitrazepam 0.04 mM). Apart from cimetidine, this is the first report describing the inhibitory effect of these drugs on ethanol metabolism. The results also show the suitability of the method to screen for inhibitory effect of drugs on ethanol metabolism helping to identify drugs for which further study is justified.",

The nanocubic vesicles were prepared by incorporating non-ionic copolymers, poloxamer 188 or 407, in the lipid bilayer. The effect of phospholipid:poloxamer molar ratio on the physicochemical properties of the nanocubic vesicles was investigated. The in vivo behavior and brain targeting of these vesicles were evaluated in rats. TEM photographs showed that the vesicles looked spherical before adding poloxamer. However, after poloxamer incorporation, the vesicles showed a predominant cubic shape, except those containing phospholipid:poloxamer in the molar ratio 5:1 which were spherical. DSC study confirmed perturbation of the packing characteristics as well as fluidization of the lipid bilayer by the polymer with consequent formation of the nanocubic structure. The mean diameter of the vesicles was in the range of 363-645 nm. All vesicles were elastic and the elasticity was found to depend on both poloxamer type and concentration. The intranasal nanocubic vesicles were significantly more efficient in targeting olanzapine to the brain compared to the liposomal vesicles with drug targeting efficiency values of 100% and 80%, respectively, and absolute bioavailability of 37.9% and 14.9%, respectively.",

Some have theorized that individual differences in behavioral and brain asymmetries are linked to variation in the density of axon fibers that traverse different sections of the CC. In this study, we examined whether variation in axon fiber density in the CC was associated with variation in asymmetries in the planum temporale (PT) in a sample of 20 post-mortem chimpanzee brains. We further tested for sex differences in small and large CC fiber proportions and density in the chimpanzees. We found that the distribution of small and large fibers within the CC of chimpanzees follows a similar pattern to those reported in humans. We also found that chimpanzees with larger asymmetries in the PT had fewer large fibers in the posterior portion of the CC, particularly among females. As has been reported in human brains, the findings reported here indicate that individual differences in brain asymmetries are associated with variation in interhemispheric connectivity as manifest in axon fiber density and size.",

Two-thirds of GPs were unaware of the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for depression and anxiety disorders. Benzodiazepines were the most recognized category of medication (75.3%) and were the most commonly used medication for all mental health conditions. Fewer GPs were familiar with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (35.1%) or tricyclic antidepressants (20.2%). Lack of time and patients' financial constraints were reported to be barriers to care. Most GPs (69.2%) had not received any recent medical education about mental health problems.

    "143": "Benzodiazepines such as diazepam are widely prescribed as anxiolytics and sleep aids. Continued use of benzodiazepines, however, can lead to addiction in vulnerable individuals. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms of the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines using the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) test, a procedure with which the reward-enhancing effects of these drugs can be measured. Benzodiazepines bind nonselectively to several different GABA(A) receptor subtypes. To elucidate the \u03b1 subunit(s) responsible for the reward-enhancing effects of benzodiazepines, we examined mice carrying a histidine-to-arginine point mutation in the \u03b11, \u03b12, or \u03b13 subunit, which renders the targeted subunit nonresponsive to diazepam, other benzodiazepines and zolpidem. In wild-type and \u03b11-point-mutated mice, diazepam caused a dose-dependent reduction in ICSS thresholds (reflecting a reward-enhancing effect) that is comparable to the reduction observed following cocaine administration. This effect was abolished in \u03b12- and \u03b13-point-mutant mice, suggesting that these subunits are necessary for the reward-enhancing action of diazepam. \u03b12 Subunits appear to be particularly important, since diazepam increased ICSS thresholds (reflecting an aversive-like effect) in \u03b12-point-mutant animals. Zolpidem, an \u03b11-preferring benzodiazepine-site agonist, had no reward-enhancing effects in any genotype. Our findings implicate \u03b12 and \u03b13 subunit containing GABA(A) receptors as key mediators of the reward-related effects of benzodiazepines. This finding has important implications for the development of new medications that retain the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines but lack abuse liability.", 
    "144": "The pregnant patient with inflammatory bowel disease presents a number of challenges to the clinician. In addition to the management of the patient's disease activity and the potential effects of disease on pregnancy, the clinician must also take into consideration any iatrogenic complications that may arise from the medical management of these conditions. Furthermore, should the patient elect to breastfeed her infant, the effect of drugs that may be passed through the breast milk must also be considered. This article focuses specifically on the issues of drug transfer to the fetus and to the breastfeeding infant. Meperidine is the sedative of choice for endoscopic procedures on pregnant patients, while benzodiazepines and propofol may be used with certain caveats. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and metronidazole are preferred if antibiotics are indicated for perianal Crohn's disease or pouchitis. The majority of medications used in the treatment of luminal IBD in pregnancy are not associated with significant adverse effects, and thus can generally be used safely. Certain medications, such as aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, and cyclosporine, appear low risk, while others such as methotrexate and thalidomide are clearly contraindicated. The role of other immunomodulators and biologics remains to be clearly defined, although early experience with infliximab and similar agents appear to be low risk. Safety in breastfeeding varies considerably among medications. There are many issues to address when considering pharmaceutical intervention in the pregnant patient, and patients should be carefully counseled regarding potential teratogenicity or adverse outcomes of medication used during pregnancy and breastfeeding.",

    "146": "Hippocampal synaptic plasticity has been related to learning and adaptive processes developed during chronic drug administration, suggesting the existence of a common neurobiological mechanism mediating drug addiction and memory. Moreover, protein kinase M zeta (PKM\u03b6) is critical for the maintenance of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial conditioned long-term memories. Also, a link between activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), PKM\u03b6 and LTP has been proposed. Our previous results demonstrated that re-exposure to the withdrawal environment was able to evoke the memory acquired when the anxiety measured as a diazepam (DZ) withdrawal sign was experienced. In the present work we evaluated if the memory associated with DZ withdrawal could be affected by changes in the contextual cues presented during withdrawal and by intrahippocampal administration of a PKM\u03b6 inhibitor. We found that the context was relevant for the expression of withdrawal signs as changes in contextual cues prevented the expression of the anxiety-like behavior observed during plus-maze (PM) re-exposure, the associated enhanced synaptic plasticity and the increase in Arc expression. Furthermore, intrahippocampal administration of PKM\u03b6 inhibitor previous to re-exposure to the PM test also impaired expression of anxiety-like behavior and the facilitated LTP. These results support the relevance of the hippocampal synaptic plasticity in the maintenance of the memory trace during benzodiazepines withdrawal, adding new evidences for common mechanisms between memory and drug addiction that can be intervened for treatment or prevention of this pathology.",

Following Institutional Review Board approval, a prospective study of 20 patients per group ages 70 and above undergoing unilateral THA or TKA was initiated. Both groups received a combined spinal-epidural, postoperative patient-controlled epidural anesthesia, and postoperative oral opioids. Patient interviews occurred five times: once preoperatively and two times each on postoperative days\u00a01 and 2. Only two patients were assessed as delirious according to the CAM method (one in each group; 5%). Patient assessment by other clinicians indicated that five additional patients experienced acute change in mental status; however, these patients were not delirious at the times of the study interviews. The rate of delirium in the elderly after arthroplasty performed under regional anesthesia is very low. Reasons for this include patient selection criteria and anesthesia type. The study excluded patients with several proposed risk factors for postoperative delirium: prior history of dementia, history of mental illness, and use of benzodiazepines. The use of regional anesthesia may have also reduced the occurrence of postoperative delirium.",

Novelty-induced rearing behavior is used to evaluate a central excitatory locomotor behavior in mice. The antipsychotic effects of the extracts were assessed using the apomorphine animal model of psychosis. The catalepsy test was tested based on the ability of the leaves extracts of Crassocephalum bauchiense to alter the duration of akinesia by placing the naive mice with both forelegs over a horizontal bar. The extracts of Crassocephalum bauchiense effects were evaluated on sodium pentobarbital-induced sleeping time. In addition, gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations in the brain treated mice were also estimated.", 
    "160": "The aqueous extract and the alkaloid fraction from Crassocephalum bauchiense caused dose-dependent inhibition of novelty-induced rearing behavior, decreased the apomorphine-induced stereotypy and fighting, and had significant fall of the body temperature. The aqueous extract prolonged the sodium pentobarbital sleeping time. This prolongation was not reversed by bicuculline, a light-sensitive competitive antagonist of GABA(A) receptors complex. However, the effect of the aqueous extract on sodium pentobarbital-induced sleeping time was blocked by N-methyl-\u03b2-carboline-3-carboxamide, a partial inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine site in the GABA(A) receptor complex and flumazenil, a specific antagonist of the benzodiazepine site in the GABAA receptor complex. In biochemical experiments, the concentration of the inhibitory amino acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid, was significantly increased in the brain of animals treated with the aqueous extract of Crassocephalum bauchiense and sodium valproate.",

    "162": "Neuroplastic theories propose that lithium has robust neuroprotective and neurotrophic actions leading to the up-regulation of synaptic plasticity, and this action may be associated with the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, is efficacious in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It has been suggested that olanzapine may also up-regulate synaptic plasticity by its neuroprotective and neurotrophic actions, and this action may be related to antipsychotic and anti-manic effects of the drug. However, few studies have directly examined whether these drugs alter synaptic plasticity. In the present study, to examine the effects of lithium and olanzapine on synaptic plasticity, we examined the effects of chronic treatment with lithium and olanzapine on long-term potentiation (LTP) and input and output (I/O) responses of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) of CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices prepared from rats administered the drugs for 4 weeks. Our results show that 4 weeks of lithium treatment magnified LTP of CA1 pyramidal cells. However, the same treatment with olanzapine did not magnify LTP of CA1 pyramidal cells. Four weeks of treatment with lithium did not alter I/O responses of CA1 pyramidal cells. However, the same treatment with olanzapine increased I/O responses of CA1 pyramidal cells. The results suggest that lithium up-regulates synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, and olanzapine increases synaptic transmission without apparent changes in LTP in the hippocampus.", 
    "163": "The present study investigated the effects of phytol in pilocarpine-induced seizures. The latency for development of convulsions and mortality rate was recorded in this model using mice. The results revealed that phytol (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg, i.p.) increased latency to first seizure and decreased percentage of these seizures. Moreover, phytol also protected the animals against status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine, and decreased the mortality rate. Mice treated with pilocarpine (n=24) presented 100% of mortality during the first hour of observation. In turn, phytol-pretreated animals within 30 min before the administration of pilocarpine (400 mg/kg) remained alive during the first hour of observation. On the other hand, 6-8h after administration of pilocarpine it was observed that 10 (41.66%), 8 (33.33%) and 4 (16.66%) animals died (respectively). Thus, the pretreatment with phytol was able to block mortality rate during the first hour in acute phase of seizures, and significantly reduced this rate in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05), suggesting an anticonvulsant effect. In addition, none of the phytol effects was blocked by pre-treatment with flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors. In conclusion, phytol exhibits anticonvulsant activity by modulating of neurotransmitter systems, but further investigations are in progress to confirm this pharmacological property.", 
    "164": "The effects of the anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) on general activity and anxiety-related behaviour of male and female Swiss-Webster mice were investigated in the triple test, which combines the open field (OF), elevated-plus maze (EPM) and the light-dark box (LDB). Mice were injected with saline or CDZ (1.0, 7.5 or 15.0 mg/kg) and their behaviour was observed for 15 min in the triple test on each of two days. On day 1, increasing doses of CDZ increased open arm exploration and total distance travelled, and decreased risk assessments in the EPM. In the LDB, CDZ increased time in the light compartment and number of transitions between compartments. In spite of habituation to the apparatus, CDZ increased the number of transitions in the LDB, increased percent time in the open arms and total distance travelled in the EPM on day 2. Thus, there was a significant effect of CDZ in the triple test on both days, even though there was habituation to the apparatus after day 1. These results show that the drug effect was independent of the day effect and that there was no one-trial tolerance effect in the triple test of anxiety.",

Sample preparation was performed on a mixed-mode cation exchange solid phase extraction cartridge. Electrospray ionization was found to be more efficient than atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. The use of a mobile phase of high pH resulted in higher retention and higher electrospray ionization signals than the conventional low pH mobile phases. Considering the benefits of a high pH mobile phase on both chromatography and mass spectrometry, its use should be encouraged. In the final method, gradient elution with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 9) and methanol was performed on a small particle column (Acquity C18, 1.7 \u03bcm, 2.1 mm \u00d7 50 mm).

To start testing whether antipsychotics act by reducing abnormal semantic activations we focused on the N400 event-related brain potential, which is elicited by meaningful stimuli, such as words, and whose distribution on the scalp is known to depend on the semantic category of these stimuli. We used a semantic-categorization task specially designed to reduce the impact of the variations of context processing across subjects' groups and a classical oddball task as a control. Healthy subjects were recruited rather than psychotic patients to ensure that the medication effects could not be secondary to a reduction of symptoms. These participants (n=47) were tested in a double-blind cross-over paradigm where the ERP effects of 2.5mg of olanzapine taken on the eve of the testing were compared to those of the placebo. The amplitudes of the N400s elicited by the target words were greater at anterior scalp sites in the half of the subjects having higher schizotypal scores. Olanzapine reduced these larger N400s and had no effect on the small anterior N400s of the half of the subjects with lower scores. These results are discussed as consistent with the idea that antipsychotics reduce abnormal activations of particular semantic representations. Further studies should thus be done to see if this reduction correlates with and predicts the decrease of psychotic symptoms in patients.",

At the neuromuscular junction, AChE is mainly anchored in the extracellular matrix by the collagen Q, whereas in the brain, AChE is tethered by the proline-rich membrane anchor (PRiMA). The AChE-deficient mice, in which AChE has been deleted from all tissues, have severe handicaps. Surprisingly, PRiMA KO mice in which AChE is mostly eliminated from the brain show very few deficits. We now report that most of the changes observed in the brain of AChE-deficient mice, and in particular the high levels of ambient extracellular acetylcholine and the massive decrease of muscarinic receptors, are also observed in the brain of PRiMA KO. However, the two groups of mutants differ in their responses to AChE inhibitors. Since PRiMA-KO mice and AChE-deficient mice have similar low AChE concentrations in the brain but differ in the AChE content of the peripheral nervous system, these results suggest that peripheral nervous system AChE is a major target of AChE inhibitors, and that its absence in AChE- deficient mice is the main cause of the slow development and vulnerability of these mice. At the level of the brain, the adaptation to the absence of AChE is nearly complete.",

CLINICAL FEATURES OF POISONING: GHB produces CNS and respiratory depression of relatively short duration. Other commonly reported features include gastrointestinal upset, bradycardia, myoclonus, and hypothermia. Fatalities have been reported. MANAGEMENT OF POISONING: Supportive care is the mainstay of management with primary emphasis on respiratory and cardiovascular support. Airway protection, intubation, and/or assisted ventilation may be indicated for severe respiratory depression. Gastrointestinal decontamination is unlikely to be beneficial. Pharmacological intervention is rarely required for bradycardia; however, atropine administration may occasionally be warranted.

The effect of the interaction can be desirable, inconsequential, or adverse. The increasing number of drugs available and the increasing use of multidrug therapeutic regimens enhance the potential for drug interactions. However, in clinical practice, most interactions are not significant or rarely of significance. It is when the interaction leads to adverse consequences that it comes to the attention of the patient and physician. Interactions may occur by pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics mechanisms. Pharmacokinetic interactions represent the modification of one substance (the interacting substance) on the ADME processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of a drug (the index drug). Subsequently, it may lead to changes in the concentration of the index drug at the receptor sites. Drug interactions with a pharmacodynamic basis involve actions on the same receptor or physiological systems through either synergism or antagonism. Many drug interactions can be predicted if the pharmacodynamics effects, pharmacokinetic properties and mechanisms of action of the interacting agents are known.

Hyperthermia was observed and rapidly treated in three animals that demonstrated insufficient immobilization after darting. Arterial blood gas analyses revealed a mean pH of 7.43 \u00b1 0.07, partial arterial pressure of CO(2) of 44.1 \u00b1 6.0 mmHg, partial arterial pressure of O(2) of 74.0 \u00b1 13.5 mmHg, and an arterial O(2) saturation of 94.77 \u00b1 3.96%. Recovery was smooth and animals were walking in 13.44 \u00b1 7.85 min. Median recovery score (1 = excellent to 4 = poor) was 1 (range 1-2). The BDM was effective in immobilizing captive healthy lechwes with minimal cardiorespiratory changes.", 
    "200": "Global postoperative amnesia (profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia) is rare and usually attributed to transient global amnesia-a poorly understood condition with no broadly accepted mechanism. We report an incident of probable transient global amnesia in a patient after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram under general anesthesia, which was successfully treated with flumazenil. On the basis of the results of flumazenil administration in this and a previous case report, we would recommend a trial dose of 0.2 mg for cases of global postoperative amnesia, repeated if the first dose seems effective.", 
    "201": "Abuse of psychogenic substances sold as \"bath salts\" and \"plant food\" has escalated in recent years in the United States (USA). Previous reports suggest regional differences in the primary active \u03b2-keto phenylalkylamines found in these products and the corresponding signs and symptoms reported after exposure. Currently, there are only limited studies describing the clinical effects associated with reported \"bath salts\" exposure in the USA. This study describes the clinical effects associated with \"bath salt\" and \"plant food\" exposures as reported to the poison center serving the state of North Carolina (Carolinas Poison Center). We performed a retrospective review of the Carolinas Poison Center database for all cases of reported human exposure to \"bath salt\" and \"plant food\" products from 2010 to 2011 with specific attention to clinical effects and routes of exposure. Additionally, we reviewed therapies used, trended the volume of exposure cases reported over the study period, and evaluated the distribution of calls within state counties using descriptive statistics. Carolinas Poison Center received 485 total calls and 409 reported exposure calls regarding \"bath salt\" or \"plant food\" products between January of 2010 and December of 2011. The peak of reported exposures occurred in May of 2011. Clinical effects commonly reported in the exposure cases generated from these calls included tachycardia (53.3 %, n\u2009=\u2009218), agitated/irritable (50.4 %, n\u2009=\u2009206), hallucination/delusions (26.7 %, n\u2009=\u2009109), and hypertension (25.2 %, n\u2009=\u2009103). In addition to intravenous fluids, common therapies included benzodiazepines (46.0 %, n\u2009=\u2009188), sedation (13.4 %, n\u2009=\u200955), alkalinization (3.90 %, n\u2009=\u200916), antihistamine (4.16 %, n\u2009=\u200917), and intubation (3.67 %, n\u2009=\u200915). Haloperidol was the antipsychotic agent used most often to treat agitation (n\u2009=\u200940). Serious complications associated with reported exposure to \"bath salt\" and \"plant food\" products included rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, excited delirium syndrome, and death. While treatments have not been empirically determined, sedation with benzodiazepines, aggressive cooling for hyperthermic patients, and use of small doses of antipsychotics for choreoathetoid movements not controlled with benzodiazepines are not likely to be harmful.", 
    "202": "Although excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is one of the key symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), associations between OSA and EDS have been inconsistent, even in patients with severe OSA. To that end, our goal was to investigate factors associated with EDS based on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score in a large clinical population with severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index \u226530).", 
    "203": "This cross-sectional study included 1,126 consecutive adult patients referred for their first in-laboratory polysomnogram for suspicion of OSA. All patients completed a routine questionnaire including demographics, race, co-morbidities, sleep history, ESS, short-form quality of life questionnaire-12 (SF-12), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, and medications used. Severe OSA was diagnosed in 498 patients. After excluding patients taking narcotics, hypnotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, or those with diagnosis of depression, 355 patients remained in the final analytic cohort. Patients were divided into quartiles based on the ESS and comparisons were made between the lowest quartile (ESS\u2009\u2264\u20096; n\u2009=\u2009105) and highest quartile (ESS\u2009\u2265\u200913; n\u2009=\u200997).", 
    "204": "Compared to the ESS\u2009\u2264\u20096 group, patients in the ESS\u2009\u2265\u200913 group had a significantly higher 3 % oxygen desaturation index and a significantly lower oxygen saturation nadir during sleep (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, patients with severe OSA in the highest quartile of ESS had higher depressive symptomatology.", 
    "205": "In patients with severe OSA, intermittent hypoxemia and depressive symptoms are important contributing factors to EDS.",

    "207": "Review of relevant medical literature.", 
    "208": "Standardized screening for delirium should be routine. Agitated delirium should be managed with an antipsychotic and, possibly, dexmedetomidine in treatment-refractory cases. Delirium management should also include ensuring a calming environment and adequate pain control, minimizing benzodiazepines and anticholinergics, normalizing the sleep-wake cycle, providing sensory aids as required, and providing early physical and occupational therapy. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome should be treated by discontinuing dopamine blockers, providing supportive therapy, and possibly administering medications (benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, and/or dantrolene) or electroconvulsive therapy, if indicated. Serotonin syndrome should be treated by discontinuing all serotonergic agents, providing supportive therapy, controlling agitation with benzodiazepines, and possibly administering serotonin2A antagonists. It is often unnecessary to restart psychiatric medications upon which a patient has overdosed in the intensive care unit, though withdrawal syndromes should be prevented, and communication with outpatient prescribers is vital.", 
    "209": "Understanding the diagnosis and appropriate management of these four psychiatric emergencies is important to provide safe and effective care in the intensive care unit.", 
    "210": "Environmental enrichment (EE) involves enhancing an animal's environment, with the goal of improving animal welfare. Though a well-established discipline, the consequences of EE on behavioural pharmacological tests have not been extensively examined. The purpose of this study was to examine the consequences of EE (or isolation) housing on a range of behavioural pharmacological tests in the rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the 3 housing conditions; IC (isolation) and SC (standard group-housed, 4/cage) were housed in standard cages (42 cm\u00d725.5 cm\u00d720 cm), while the EE group was housed in groups of 4 in larger cages (54 cm\u00d738 cm\u00d719 cm) enriched with a variety of wooden, cardboard and plastic toys/objects. After 4 weeks, housing effects were examined in the following pharmacological tests: diazepam (DZP) effects on anxiolytic behaviour in the elevated plus maze (EPM); desipramine (DMI) effects on immobility time in the forced swim test (FST) and amphetamine (AMP) effects on homecage activity. Dose-response assessments demonstrated that rats housed in EE showed reduced sensitivity to the behavioural effects of DZP and DMI but increased sensitivity to the locomotor-enhancing effects of AMP compared to SC and IC; while IC animals exhibited the clearest dose-response effects to increasing doses of DMI. It may be concluded that environmental manipulation can vary along a continuum and its intensity may be crucial to observable effects. Nonetheless, environmental factors can influence sensitivity to psychotropic drugs and should be considered when implementing EE protocols in such evaluations.", 
    "211": "Repeated haloperidol and olanzapine treatment produces an enhanced disruption of avoidance responding, a validated measure of antipsychotic activity. Experimental parameters affecting this sensitization-like effect have not been thoroughly examined. The present study investigated the role of three parameters (number of injections, dose, and interval between initial exposure and challenge) in antipsychotic sensitization in the conditioned avoidance response paradigm. Well-trained Sprague-Dawley rats received different numbers of drug treatment (1-5 days) or different doses of haloperidol (0.025-0.10 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or olanzapine (0.5-2.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously). After certain time intervals (4, 10 or 17 days), they were tested for the expression of haloperidol or olanzapine sensitization in a challenge test in which all rats were injected with a lower dose of haloperidol (0.025 mg/kg) or olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg). Throughout the drug-treatment period, both haloperidol and olanzapine dose-dependently enhanced their disruption of avoidance responding. Three days later, the sensitization induced by a low dose of haloperidol (0.025 mg/kg) or olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg) was only apparent in rats that received treatment for 5 days, but not in those that received treatment for 1-4 days. The sensitization induced by the medium and high doses of haloperidol (0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg) or olanzapine (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) was still robust even with only 3 days of treatment. The sensitization induced by a 3-day haloperidol (0.10 mg/kg) and olanzapine (2.0 mg/kg) treatment was long-lasting, still detectable 17 days after the last drug treatment. This study suggests that antipsychotic sensitization is a robust behavioral phenomenon. Its induction and expression are strongly influenced by parameters such as number of drug exposures, drug dose, and test-retest interval. Given the importance of antipsychotic sensitization in the maintenance of antipsychotic effects in the clinic, this study introduces a paradigm that can be used to investigate the behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms underlying antipsychotic sensitization."
