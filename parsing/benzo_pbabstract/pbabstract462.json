The association of [3H] NBMPR with Ehrlich cell membranes occurred in two distinct phases, possibly reflecting functional conformation changes in the [3H]NBMPR binding site/nucleoside transporter complex. Inhibitors of the equilibrium binding of [3H]NBMPR, tested at submaximal inhibitory concentrations, generally decreased the rate of association of [3H]NBMPR, but the magnitude of this effect varied significantly with the agent tested. Adenosine and diazepam had relatively minor effects on the association rate, whereas dipyridamole and mioflazine slowed the rate dramatically. Inhibitors of nucleoside transport also decreased the rate of dissociation of [3H]NBMPR, with an order of potency significantly different from their relative potencies as inhibitors of the equilibrium binding of [3H]NBMPR. Dilazep, dipyridamole, and mioflazine were effective inhibitors of both [3H]NBMPR dissociation and equilibrium binding. The lidoflazine analogue R75231, on the other hand, had no effect on the rate of dissociation of [3H]NBMPR at concentrations below 300 microM, even though it was one of the most potent inhibitors of [3H]NBMPR binding tested (Ki less than 100 nM). In contrast, a series of natural substrates for the nucleoside transport system enhanced the rate of dissociation of [3H]NBMPR with an order of effectiveness that paralleled their relative affinities for the permeant site of the transporter. The most effective enhancers of [3H]NBMPR dissociation, however, were the benzodiazepines diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and triazolam. Comparable effects of adenosine and dipyridamole on [3H]NBMPR dissociation rate were obtained upon solubilization of the membranes with octylglucoside, suggesting that this phenomenon was not due to changes in membrane fluidity. These results are compatible with the existence of specific ligand recognition sites on the nucleoside transport complex of Ehrlich cells that are pharmacologically distinct from, but allosterically linked to, the high affinity binding sites for [3H]NBMPR. The marked effects on [3H]NBMPR binding kinetics that result from ligand interactions with these sites must be considered in the design and analysis of all studies involving the use of [3H]NBMPR as a high affinity probe for the nucleoside transport system.", 
    "1": "We have determined routinely administered benzodiazepines and some of their metabolites in clinical samples by using on-line column switching for sample clean-up and reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The plasma sample is directly injected onto a cyanopropyl (CN) pre-column, washed with buffer, and eluted onto an analytical column (C18, octadecylsilane). Analytical recovery from drug-supplemented plasma samples was greater than 85% for all the benzodiazepines tested. The response of the analytical column varied linearly with drug concentrations over the range 0.01-1 mg/L in plasma, with CVs ranging from 0.3% to 1.8% within-day and 5.5% to 15.7% between days. The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3) was 0.01 mg/L (1 ng on column) for all of the benzodiazepines and their metabolites. The advantages of the technique include the extreme cleanliness of the traces, no requirement for off-line sample preparation, and ease of automation.",

    "4": "Recreational drug use presents a challenge to society and, in particular, the profession of nursing. Recreational drug use must be appreciated for the implications it presents for the episodes of abuse and development of chronic health problems. The effects and recreational use of volatile substances, cannabis, opioids, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, cocaine, psychedelics, and designer drugs as well as alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine must be acknowledged and understood if options for change are to be considered. The resultant cost of recreational drug use as well as health care implications, public safety, and prevention are significant issues society is faced with today. These issues will continue to be significant unless the current posture toward recreational drug use and abuse is addressed. The profession of nursing continues to be faced with the problems associated with recreational drug use not only through caring for clients, but immediately by the effects of recreational drug use on individual professional nurses. To respond effectively, nursing education and nursing research must be challenged to create an emphasis on this focus. Only through this type of multifocal approach will long-term substantial change be affected for the betterment of future generations.", 
    "5": "Agonists and antagonists selective for the brain-type [cholecystokinin (CCK)-B] and the peripheral-type (CCK-A) CCK receptor were used to localize the site(s) of action at which CCK inhibits food consumption. BC 264, a highly selective CCK-B receptor agonist, did not decrease consumption of a palatable meal when administered either i.p. or into the lateral ventricles of the brain, whereas CCK decreased feeding when administered i.p. at the same doses. CCK decreased feeding when administered i.v.t. at a high dose, 5 micrograms. L-364,718, an antagonist selective for the CCK-A receptor, blocked completely the action of centrally administered CCK, whereas L-365,260, a selective CCK-B receptor antagonist, had no effect on the ability of centrally administered CCK to inhibit feeding. To estimate the quantity of i.v.t. administered CCK which reached the periphery, a tracer of radiolabeled [3H]p-CCK8 ([3H]CCK octapeptide sulfate), combined with unlabeled pCCK8 (5 micrograms) was administered i.c.t. Thirty minutes after administration, intact radiolabeled pCCK8 was extracted from the plasma and measured in the blood in nanomolar concentrations, exceeding the amounts of CCK octapeptide sulfate reported previously to be present in the plasma after a meal. Intraventricularly administered CCK thus appears to reduce feeding in the rat through a mechanism involving a CCK-A receptor subtype in the periphery.", 
    "6": "Training-induced neuronal activity develops in the mammalian limbic system during discriminative avoidance conditioning. This study explores behaviorally relevant changes in muscarinic ACh receptor binding in 52 rabbits that were trained to one of five stages of conditioned response acquisition. Sixteen naive and 10 animals yoked to criterion performance served as control cases. Upon reaching a particular stage of training, the brains were removed and autoradiographically assayed for 3H-oxotremorine-M binding with 50 nM pirenzepine (OXO-M/PZ) or for 3H-pirenzepine binding in nine limbic thalamic nuclei and cingulate cortex. Specific OXO-M/PZ binding increased in the parvocellular division of the anterodorsal nucleus early in training when the animals were first exposed to pairing of the conditional and unconditional stimuli. Elevated binding in this nucleus was maintained throughout subsequent training. In the parvocellular division of the anteroventral nucleus (AVp), OXO-M/PZ binding progressively increased throughout training, reached a peak at the criterion stage of performance, and returned to control values during extinction sessions. Peak OXO-M/PZ binding in AVp was significantly elevated over that for cases yoked to criterion performance. In the magnocellular division of the anteroventral nucleus (AVm), OXO-M/PZ binding was elevated only during criterion performance of the task, and it was unaltered in any other limbic thalamic nuclei. Specific OXO-M/PZ binding was also elevated in most layers in rostral area 29c when subjects first performed a significant behavioral discrimination. Training-induced alterations in OXO-M/PZ binding in AVp and layer Ia of area 29c were similar and highly correlated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "The CNS effects resulting from the combined administration of midazolam and flumazenil were studied in 8 healthy volunteers to develop a model of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic interaction. Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded between Fp1-M1 and Fp2-M2. The EEG parameter total number of waves between 12 and 30 Hz (TNW12-30) derived by aperiodic analysis was used to quantify the effect. Following a 15 min baseline EEG recording, infusion of placebo or flumazenil was started. Infusion regimens for flumazenil were designed so that 'steady-state' concentrations of 10 and 20 micrograms/L were obtained. Doses of midazolam 15, 30 and 60 mg over 5 min were given 30 min after the start of placebo infusion (session A) or flumazenil infusion to 10 micrograms/L (session B) or 20 micrograms/L (session C), respectively. Venous blood samples were taken until 8 h after the start of the flumazenil or placebo infusion. A sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) model was used to characterise the relationship between the plasma concentration of midazolam which is in equilibrium with the effect compartment concentration (Cem) [Cem/Kp] and TNW12-30. Within 2 to 5 min of starting the midazolam infusion all subjects fell asleep, with loss of eyelid reflex. They awoke between 25 and 82 min later in all 3 sessions. The mean (+/- SD) plasma drug concentrations of midazolam corresponding to half the maximum increase in TNW12-30 (EC50) were 276 +/- 64, 624 +/- 187 and 1086 +/- 379 micrograms/L in sessions A, B and C, respectively. The half-lives reflecting equilibration between plasma concentration and effect (t1/2ke0), estimated by a nonparametric method, were 2.2 +/- 1.2, 3.3 +/- 3.3 and 2.9 +/- 1.2 min for the 3 different sessions. Emax and N were not affected by flumazenil. In each subject the plot of the average measured steady-state plasma flumazenil concentration versus the EC50 of midazolam showed a linear relationship. The plasma concentration of flumazenil that doubled the EC50 of midazolam (Cf,2) was 6.5 +/- 1.0 micrograms/L. The observed interaction is consistent with the competitive nature of the antagonism of midazolam by flumazenil.", 
    "8": "The effect of intravenous flumazenil 10 mg on the electroencephalogram (EEG) was investigated in 7 volunteers in a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind, crossover study. The EEG was recorded between Fp1-M1 and Fp2-M2 and analysed using an aperiodic analysis technique. Two volunteers were excluded from the study because of significant asymmetry between baseline EEG recordings of the left and right hemisphere, in the remainder there were no changes in the beta-frequency range (12 to 30 Hz) or in other ranges of the EEG during or after flumazenil or placebo administration, with regard to the parameters total number of waves per second or total amplitude per second. There were no changes in heart rate, respiratory rate or blood pressure after administration of flumazenil or placebo. Three volunteers reported feelings of 'pressure to move' during the initial 2 min of the flumazenil infusion. The pharmacokinetics of flumazenil were investigated in the same volunteers. Flumazenil 10 mg was administered intravenously over 10 min; the data from 1 volunteer were excluded from this analysis because of blood sampling problems. The plasma concentration-time data of the remaining 6 volunteers were characterised by a biexponential function. The pharmacokinetic parameters were (mean +/- SD): initial volume of distribution, 16 +/- 5.7L; volume of distribution at steady-state, 64.8 +/- 12.5L; total body clearance, 53.8 +/- 1.2 L/h; distribution half-life, 4.1 +/- 1.3 min; and elimination half-life, 70.2 +/- 9.9 min. The authors conclude that flumazenil has no significant EEG effects. The rapid distribution and elimination of flumazenil may explain its previously reported short duration of action after intravenous anaesthesia with high doses of midazolam.", 
    "9": "Since blockers of excitatory transmission have been shown to reduce anoxic and ischemic neuronal damage, augmentation of inhibitory transmission by agents such as midazolam might have a similar protective effect. Rat hippocampal slices were maintained in vitro and used to determine whether and by what mechanism midazolam improves recovery of evoked responses after anoxia. The Schaffer collateral pathway in the slice was stimulated electrically, and an extracellular potential, the evoked population spike, was recorded from the CA1 pyramidal cells, which are postsynaptic. The slices were made anoxic by substituting artificial cerebrospinal fluid aerated with 95% nitrogen-5% carbon dioxide for fluid aerated with 95% oxygen-5% carbon dioxide. Percentage recovery was expressed as the amplitude of the evoked population spike 60 min after anoxia divided by its preanoxic amplitude. Protection in this model is defined as a significant (P less than 0.05) improvement in percentage recovery compared to the recovery of untreated slices. There was no recovery of the response recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells after 5 min of anoxia (4 +/- 2%) (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]). Slices were treated with midazolam 10 min before, during, and 10 min after anoxia. Midazolam (1 microM) did not enhance recovery after anoxia when dissolved either in water (3 +/- 3%) or in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (1 +/- 1%). A higher concentration of midazolam (100 microM) did enhance recovery when dissolved in DMSO (27 +/- 7%) but not when dissolved in water (5 +/- 2%). To test whether prolonged pretreatment with midazolam dissolved in water would enhance recovery, slices were treated for 30 min prior to anoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "The anesthetic interactions of midazolam and fentanyl were determined in terms of enflurane MAC reduction in dogs. In part 1, 8 animals received an intravenous (iv) loading dose of fentanyl followed by a constant infusion at 0.05 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 to produce a stable enflurane MAC reduction of approximately 20%. Midazolam was then administered in a series of three incremental loading doses and infusions (2.4, 9.6, and 28.8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 previously determined to produce enflurane MAC reductions of approximately 30, 45, and 60%, respectively. Enflurane MAC was determined for each infusion. Then fentanyl was discontinued; naloxone 1 mg/kg was administered; and enflurane MAC was determined. In part 2, six dogs received a loading dose and a continuous infusion of fentanyl (0.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) designed to produce a stable enflurane MAC reduction of approximately 40%. A series of two incremental loading doses and infusions of midazolam (2.4 and 28.8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) were added, and MAC determinations were repeated at each infusion rate. Then midazolam was discontinued; flumazenil (RO 15-1788) 1.5 mg/kg was administered; and enflurane MAC was determined. The fentanyl concentrations in plasma remained stable at 1.0 +/- 0.3 ng/ml (mean +/- standard deviation [SD], part 1) and 3.1 +/- 0.5 ng/ml (part 2) throughout the study and, in the absence of midazolam, reduced enflurane MAC by 28 +/- 11 and 44 +/- 5%, respectively. The addition of midazolam produced significant further reductions in enflurane MAC, but the reductions were less than those predicted on the basis of an additive interaction. Naloxone returned enflurane MAC reduction to that expected for midazolam alone (part 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Sixty unpremedicated outpatients undergoing elective extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy using an unmodified Dornier HM-3 lithotriptor were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either alfentanil or ketamine as an adjuvant to midazolam for sedation and analgesia. Although both drug regimens allowed the maximal number of shock waves and energy level, the alfentanil group had significantly better calculi fragmentation (78% vs. 50% of patients with fragments less than 2 mm). Ketamine infusion provided superior intraoperative cardiorespiratory stability; however, it was associated with more disruptive movements (22 vs. 5) and dreaming (35% vs. 5%) during the procedure (P less than 0.05). Postoperatively, confusion also occurred more frequently in the ketamine-treated patients (31% vs. 5%, P less than 0.05). Alfentanil infusion was associated with more episodes of hemoglobin oxygen desaturation to less than 90% (12 vs. 2, P less than 0.05), itching (23% vs. 4%, P less than 0.05), and ability to recall intraoperative events (45% vs. 12%, P less than 0.05). The incidence of postoperative nausea was decreased (not significantly) in the alfentanil group (32% vs. 54%). The mean anesthesia time was similar in both groups; however, discharge times (means +/- standard deviations) were shorter in the alfentanil group (142 +/- 42 min vs. 161 +/- 31 min, P = 0.05). These data suggest that although both techniques proved effective for anesthesia in outpatients undergoing immersion lithotripsy, alfentanil is superior to ketamine as part of a sedative-analgesic technique because of the improved recovery profile and calculi fragmentation.",

    "16": "A randomized nonblinded study was performed in three cancer centers to test over a 10-day period the efficacy of (1) a triazolobenzodiazepine, alprazolam, 0.5 mg three times a day and (2) use of a behavioral technique in which patients were trained in progressive muscle relaxation at an initial session with a behavioral psychologist and then asked to listen at home to an audiotape of the session three times a day. Of 147 cancer patients who met entry levels of distress and completed the study, uncontrolled for site or disease stage, 70 were randomized to drug, 77 to relaxation. Four measures of anxiety and depression were used: Covi, Raskin, Affects Balance, and Symptoms Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Results showed that both treatment arms resulted in significant (P less than .001) decrease in observer and patient-reported anxious and depressed mood symptoms. Although both treatment arms were effective, patients receiving the drug showed a slightly more rapid decrease in anxiety and greater reduction of depressive symptoms. These findings confirm efficacy of both alprazolam and relaxation to reduce cancer-related anxiety and depression. As safe, inexpensive, and effective interventions, physicians should consider their use in cancer patients experiencing anxiety and depressive symptoms.", 
    "17": "To evaluate the effects of caffeine and cocaine on the impairment of discriminative motor control produced by midazolam, rats were trained to hold a force transducer operated with a paw so that it remained between upper and lower limits of a force band for a continuous 1.5-s period to deliver each food pellet. Acute doses of 3 mg/kg midazolam SC impaired motor performance. Except for one animal, caffeine (10-40 mg/kg IP) had little or no effect on performance, while cocaine (3.75-22.5 mg/kg IP) produced dose-related impairment. When each dose of caffeine was combined with 3 mg/kg midazolam, a marked synergism in motor performance impairment occurred. Cocaine plus midazolam produced mainly an additive synergism. The conspicuous synergistic action of caffeine on the motor control deficit produced by midazolam contrasts with the typical antagonism found between the benzodiazepines and methylxanthines when performance is evaluated by psychomotor tests not requiring fine motor control.", 
    "18": "Since both diphenyl-substituted antimuscarinics and benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs have been reported to increase responding under fixed-ratio schedules of food presentation, these antimuscarinics may also have anxiolytic activity. The effects of aprophen and benactyzine on punished responding of rats, a preclinical anxiolytic drug screen, were compared with those of atropine and chlordiazepoxide. None of the antimuscarinics produced consistent overall increases in behavior suppressed by punishment, in contrast to the dose-dependent increases obtained with chlordiazepoxide. Aprophen did not potentiate the anxiolytic activity of chlordiazepoxide. However, a high dose of atropine potentiated the effects of chlordiazepoxide on punished responding. Thus the diphenyl-substituted antimuscarinics, aprophen and benactyzine, do not possess consistent or robust anxiolytic activity in this preclinical screen. The previously reported behavioral excitatory effects of these compounds may therefore be unrelated to this pharmacological action.", 
    "19": "Dogs dosed chronically (4-7 weeks) with oral flunitrazepam (7.6 mg/kg/day) or diazepam (24-36 mg/kg/day) administered in 4 equally divided doses had dose-related flumazenil precipitated benzodiazepine abstinence scale scores (BPAS) of comparable intensities despite the fact that plasma levels of flunitrazepam and its metabolites were much lower than nordiazepam levels in the diazepam-dependent dog. Both groups of dependent dogs had clonic and tonic-clonic seizures after oral and IV flumazenil. Precipitated abstinence signs persisted longer in the diazepam than in the flunitrazepam-dependent dogs. Differences in the pharmacokinetics of the drugs of dependence, their metabolites, and their interactions at receptor sites offer a partial explanation for the high level of dependence seen in the flunitrazepam dog. The finding that the estimated plasma free concentration of flunitrazepam and its metabolites is equal to or greater than that of diazepam and its metabolites together with the fact that flunitrazepam has a higher affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor than either diazepam, nordiazepam or oxazepam can explain why the intensity of the precipitated abstinence syndrome is comparable in flunitrazepam- and diazepam-dependent dogs. Although the flumazenil-induced precipitated abstinence syndromes observed in flunitrazepam- and diazepam-dependent dogs differed qualitatively they did not differ quantitatively. It is therefore concluded from these data that the doses of flunitrazepam and diazepam, chosen for producing comparable degrees of weight loss during dose escalation, did not differ in the degree of physical dependence that they produced in the dog.", 
    "20": "Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic which does not share the muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant and sedative properties of classical anxiolytics such as the benzodiazepines. It has variable effects in conflict tasks based on shock which normally show consistent effects with classical anxiolytics. The present experiment investigated the effects of buspirone on successive discrimination, a conflict task employing omission of reward rather than shock. Buspirone (3.3, 1.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, IP) and chlordiazepoxide (5 and 20 mg/kg, IP) were administered to separate groups of rats throughout acquisition of a visual successive discrimination. Chlordiazepoxide released nonrewarded responding in a dose-related fashion. The effects of buspirone were qualitatively similar in releasing response suppression but were both less in magnitude and less clearly related to dose. The experiment shows that the action of buspirone in successive discrimination tasks does not depend on the use of shock but, rather, appears to be a genuine failure to fully release behavioural inhibition.", 
    "21": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of two structurally dissimilar calcium channel blockers, verapamil (a phenylalkylamine) in a single dose of 40 and 80 mg, and nifedipine (a dihydropyridine) in a single dose of 10 and 15 mg, on psychomotor performance and higher mental functions in human volunteers. Placebo and diazepam (5 mg) were used as negative and positive controls respectively. For evaluating these functions, tests employed were arithmetic ability, visual and auditory reaction time, letter (alphabet) cancellation, rapid fire arithmetic deviation and short term memory for playing cards. Careful record was kept of the heart rate, blood pressure and side effects of the therapy, each time the psychomotor tests were performed. Verapamil, both in 40 and 80 mg dose, was found to impair the performance of subjects to a significant extent in auditory reaction time, letter cancellation and short term memory. These effects were similar to those observed with administration of diazepam. With nifedipine, impairment in performance was observed only in rapid arithmetic deviation test. Thus, calcium channel antagonists, specially verapamil, impaired psychomotor performance of human subjects in our study.", 
    "22": "Twenty-five patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia undergoing 41 cycles of chemotherapy with daunorubicin/cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) or with etoposide/ara-C received metoclopramide (MCP; 0.5 mg/kg 6 hourly i.v.) or MCP (same dose) plus oral lorazepam (1 mg/d) during and 24 hours following the chemotherapy as antiemetic medication. Control of vomiting was achieved is 55% (complete 5%, partial 50%) of the patients receiving MCP alone and in 100 percent (complete 76.1%; partial 23.8%) of those receiving MCP plus lorazepam (p less than 0.001). Eighteen of the 21 patients (85.7%) receiving MCP plus lorazepam opted for the same antiemetic regimen as compared to six of the 20 (30%) receiving MCP alone (p less than 0.01). One patient in each group developed mild sedation during the treatment. It is concluded that oral lorazepam is an effective and safe adjuvant to MCP for the control of vomiting during cancer chemotherapy.", 
    "23": "Benzodiazepines are drugs that belong to the group of minor tranquilizers. They derive from the 1-4, benzodiazepine common nucleus that was obtained by chemical synthesis and act upon the GABA receptors increasing their affinity, thus providing them with their tranquilizing, miorelaxing, and anticonvulsant properties. Due to these characteristics they have been used in a wide variety of disorders accompanied by anxiety, hyperexitability, convulsions, and muscular hypertony, as well as during pregnancy and labor. Before using them in pregnant women, the physician should consider the conditions of the product \"in uterus\" since, according to experimental evidences, benzodiazepines could interfere with embryonary development, mainly with those involved in central nervous system mechanisms causing tissular alterations, retardment in cellular differentiation, and behavioral disturbances. Besides, since the fetus has lower excretion rate than that of the mother, drug concentrations are greater than the therapeutic ones and fetal tolerance to the compound, administered during the last trimester, is reduced, originating abstinence or intoxication syndromes in the newborn. It is concluded that more research is needed to evaluate all the aftereffects caused by using these drugs during pregnancy.", 
    "24": "The volume and neuron number of the sexually dimorphic accessory olfactory bulb and locus coeruleus are altered by early postnatal exposure (from the day of birth to postnatal day 16) to diazepam. After diazepam treatment, both volume and neuron number were decreased in the male accessory olfactory bulb and in the female locus coeruleus. These results indicate that early postnatal diazepam administration can bear gender-dependent teratogenic effects upon sexually dimorphic nuclei and suggest that endogenous benzodiazepines may be involved in the sexual differentiation of the brain.", 
    "25": "The hypnotic action and residual effects of a single night-time dose of midazolam (Ro 21-3981, Dormicum, 7.5 mg; CAS 59467-70-8) were investigated in young, healthy adults. The subjects went to bed at the habitual time and were awakened 3 h later for drug or placebo intake. Then they were allowed to continue their sleep. Motor activity was continuously recorded by a wrist-worn activity monitor. In comparison to placebo, prolonged night-time immobility periods were more frequent after midazolam. Sleep tended to be perceived as more quiet and as less interrupted by awakenings. 15 min after awakening in the morning, the subjects felt more relaxed after midazolam than after placebo. Performance assessed 2 h after awakening by a psychomotor test showed no decrement. The results show that a 7.5-mg dose of midazolam taken in the first half of the night has a significant hypnotic action without impairing psychomotor performance in the morning.", 
    "26": "The effects of 1-20 mg/kg diazepam were studied on the extracellular concentrations of dopamine (DA), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the nucleus accumbens and striatum of conscious rats, using intracerebral microdialysis. Five, but not 1 mg/kg diazepam significantly reduced extracellular DA, DOPAC and HVA in the nucleus accumbens. Twenty mg/kg diazepam significantly reduced extracellular DA, DOPAC and HVA in the striatum. A significant effect on striatal DOPAC, but not on DA and HVA, was seen with 10 mg/kg diazepam, while no changes were found with 5 mg/kg diazepam. The results suggest that diazepam reduces the release and metabolism of DA in the nucleus accumbens more than in the striatum.", 
    "27": "Responses to bilateral vagal nerve stimulation, to field stimulation, and to exogenous methacholine and histamine were compared in tracheas isolated from (a) saline injected (i.p.) and saline-aerosol exposed guinea pigs (control), (b) ovalbumin-sensitized and saline-aerosol exposed (sensitized) guinea pigs, and (c) ovalbumin-sensitized and 2% ovalbumin-aerosol exposed (challenged) guinea pigs. Tracheal pressor responses (cmH2O; 1 cmH2O = 98.1 Pa) to nerve and field stimulation, and maximal responses to methacholine and histamine were significantly increased in animals from group c compared with groups a and b. Dose-response lines in response to the two agonists, expressed as percent maximal contraction, did not differ among the groups. The M1 antagonist pirenzepine (0.1-10 nM) selectively reduced responses to nerve stimulation in all three groups. The M2 antagonist gallamine potentiated responses to nerve or field stimulation in all three groups. We conclude that M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptor functioning is similar in control and ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs. Changes in post-receptor transduction mechanisms may mediate the increased responsiveness noted in animals from group c.", 
    "28": "In view of the important role played by the cholinergic system in the neural regulation of growth hormone (GH) secretion, the ability of pirenzepine, a selective antagonist of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, to blunt the GH response to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) was studied in adolescent females with anorexia nervosa in the acute (AN-AP) five AN-AP patients, administration of GHRH 1-40 (1 microgram/kg IV) evoked a significantly higher GH response than in controls at established intervals, whereas in eight AN-RP and seven AED patients it was higher than in controls at only one (150-min) and two (150-min, 180-min) time intervals, respectively. In the AN-AP patients, pretreatment with pirenzepine (0.6 mg/kg IV) only partially blocked the GH response to GHRH, whereas in the same AN-AP patients tested during recovery, and in AN-RP and AED patients, the drug completely suppressed the GH response to GHRH, as it did in controls. In view of pirenzepine's mechanism of action, these findings are best explained by the existence in the hypothalamus of AN-AP patients of a cholinergic hypertone and/or a diminished somatostatinergic function. Evaluation of the clinical and hormonal characteristics of the anorectic patients studied would indicate that factors other than undernutrition and its biological consequences, which subside in the recovery stage of the disease and are not present in AED patients, contribute to the anomalous GH response pattern of AN-AP patients.",

In Experiment 1, the effects of chlordiazepoxide alone and in combination with a series of putative antagonists at various sites on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex on conditioned suppression of operant behavior in rats were assessed. Response rates during presentation of a stimulus associated with shock (CS responding) and when only positive reinforcement is effective (pre-CS responding) were analysed. Chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) significantly increased CS responding. This effect was significantly antagonised by Ro15-1788 (10 mg/kg) and by picrotoxin (1.5 mg/kg), but not by bicuculline (1.5 mg/kg) or by delta-amino-n-valeric acid (10 or 20 mg/kg). Chlordiazepoxide also significantly, albeit more slightly, increased pre-CS responding and none of the other drugs tested significantly antagonised this action, though Ro15-1788 plus chlordiazepoxide resulted in pre-CS response rates not significantly different from either chlordiazepoxide alone or control. These interactions are discussed in the context of the proposed GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex with the conclusion that drug effects at the benzodiazepine- and picrotoxin-sensitive channel sites have an important role in mediating anxiolytic action. However, behavioral evidence of an important role for GABAa or GABAb receptors remains very limited. The second experiment studied the intrinsic actions of bicuculline, picrotoxin, and Ro15-1788 on conditioned suppression. Responding during a conditioned stimulus associated with a mild (0.125 to 0.15 mA) electric shock (CS responding) and a control rate of responding (pre-CS responding) were recorded. Bicuculline (1.5 mg/kg) and Ro15-1788 (10 mg/kg) did not significantly affect either response rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "Isolated rabbit gastric glands were used to study the nature of the muscarinic cholinergic responses of parietal cells. Carbachol (CCh, 100 microM) stimulation of acid secretion, as measured by the accumulation of aminopyrine, was inhibited by the M1 antagonist, pirenzepine, with an IC50 of 13 microM; by the M2 antagonist, 11,2-(diethylamino)methyl-1 piperidinyl acetyl-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido 2,3-b 1,4 benzodiazepin-6-one (AF-DX 116), with an IC50 of 110 microM; and by the M1/M3 antagonist, diphenyl-acetoxy-4-methylpiperidinemethiodide (4-DAMP), with an IC50 of 35 nM. The three antagonists displayed equivalent IC50 values for the inhibition of carbachol-stimulated production of 14CO2 from radiolabeled glucose, which is a measure of the turnover of the H,K-ATPase, the final step of acid secretion. Intracellular calcium levels were measured in gastric glands loaded with FURA 2. Carbachol was shown to both release calcium from an intracellular pool and to promote calcium entry across the plasma membrane. The calcium entry was inhibitable by 20 microM La3+. The relative potency of the three muscarinic antagonists for inhibition of calcium entry was essentially the same as for inhibition of acid secretion or pump related glucose oxidation. Image analysis of the glands showed the effects of carbachol, and of the antagonists, on intracellular calcium were occurring largely in the parietal cell. The rise in cell calcium due to release of calcium from intracellular stores was inhibited by 4-DAMP with an IC50 of 1.7 nM, suggesting that the release pathway was regulated by a low affinity M3 muscarinic receptor or state; Ca entry and acid secretion are regulated by a high affinity M3 muscarinic receptor or state, inhibited by higher 4-DAMP concentrations (greater than 30 nM), suggesting that it is the steady-state elevation of Ca that is related to parietal cell function rather than the [Ca]i transient. Displacement of 3H N-methyl scopolamine (NMS) binding to purified parietal cells by CCh showed the presence of two affinities for CCh, but only a single affinity for 4-DAMP and lower affinity for pirenzepine and AFDX 116, providing further evidence for the parietal cell location of the [Ca]i response. Elevation of steady-state [Ca]i levels with either ionomycin or arachidonic acid did not replicate M3 stimulation of acid secretion or glucose oxidation, hence elevation of [Ca]i is necessary but not sufficient for acid secretion.", 
    "31": "Under the aspect of life-threatening pneumonias in long-term ventilated patients receiving ant-acids or H2-antagonists the prophylaxis of stress ulcer with pirenzepine gains new importance. This study was aimed at detecting cardiac side effects of pirenzepine due to low receptor specificity. Pirenzepine (10 mg) was given via the peripheral or central venous route at an injection velocity of 5 or 30 seconds as well as a control of 2 ml normal saline solution via the central venous route for 5 seconds, 20 times each. Heart rate and blood pressure were determined before and after the injection. Independent of the injection site or velocity, an increase in the heart rate was found after the injection of pirenzepine. The increase was more marked if the central venous route was used. The percentage rise in heart rate was up to the thirteenth minute highly significant when comparing pirenzepine to normal saline solution. There were no changes in blood pressure. If M1-cholinoceptors are blocked, a reduction of the heart rate is seen. Blocking M2-cholinoceptors causes a rise in the heart rate. Injecting 10 mg of the M1-antagonist pirenzepine results in a significant increase in the heart rate, independent of site or velocity of injection which can be explained by blocking M2-cholinoceptors at the same time. To prevent this probably dose-dependent effect, pirenzepine should be given slowly over a couple of minutes.", 
    "32": "1. Membranes from rat cerebral cortex, myocardium and extraorbital lacrimal gland were used as sources of M1, M2 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors respectively and the affinities of seven antagonists for the three subtypes were examined under different experimental conditions. 2. The affinities for the membrane-bound receptors were measured at different ionic strengths and temperatures and compared with those determined on the receptor solubilised in the neutral detergent digitonin or the zwitterionic detergent, CHAPSO. 3. The range of measured affinity constants of a given antagonist for a specific subtype varied from 2 (atropine at M1 receptors) to 1000 (AF-DX 116 at M2 receptors). 4. As a consequence of these changes in affinity, which were dependent on the drug, the subtype and the experimental conditions, both the structure-binding relationships of a given subtype can be markedly changed as well as the selectivity of a drug for the different subtypes. For example it is possible to change the relative affinities of AF-DX 116 and gallamine at membrane-bound M1 receptors from 50:1 to 1:60. 5. Experimental conditions for the observation of high selectivity of pirenzepine, AF-DX 116, gallamine and hexahydrosiladiphenidol for the three subtypes are given. 6. When the receptors are removed from their membrane environment by solubilisation in detergent, antagonist affinities are changed but the subtypes still retain different structure-binding relationships. 7. In general, AF-DX 116 and the allosteric antagonist, gallamine, behave differently from the other antagonists, suggesting that they bind in different ways to muscarinic receptors. Careful attention should therefore be paid to the experimental conditions in binding assays used to assess the affinities and selectivities of new muscarinic antagonists in order to avoid misleading results. 9. The ability to produce enhanced or attenuated affinities and selectivities of antagonists, resulting from the induction of different conformations of the receptor by a variety of physical, chemical or molecular biological perturbations may lead to a better understanding of the structural basis of drug receptor interactions.", 
    "33": "Extracellular recording techniques were combined with antidromic stimulation to examine the effects of C-terminal cholecystokinin (CCK) fragments and CCK antagonists on the activity of identified mesoaccumbens dopamine (MADA) neurons in chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats. These experiments were designed to determine the receptor selectivity of sulfated CCK octapeptide (CCK-8S) effects on MADA cells. Neither CCK tetrapeptide (CCK-4) nor unsulfated CCK octapeptide (CCK-8U) significantly altered MADA cell basal firing rate or responsiveness to the inhibitory effects of the D2 DA agonist quinpirole. As reported previously for ventral tegmental area DA cells, CCK-8S produced increases or decreases in the firing rate of most MADA cells sampled. CCK-8S also enhanced the sensitivity of MADA neurons to quinpirole-induced inhibition. This increase in sensitivity to quinpirole was blocked by pretreatment with the nonselective CCK receptor antagonist proglumide and the preferential CCK-A receptor antagonist CR 1409 but not by the preferential CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365,260. The inactivity of CCK-4 and CCK-8U in these tests and the results with the antagonists suggest that the effects of CCK-8S on MADA neuronal activity are mediated by CCK-A receptors.", 
    "34": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam were investigated in six patients with cirrhosis and six sex-matched control subjects. These subjects received a single 30-mg oral dose of adinazolam mesylate. Serial blood samples were collected for 24 hours after drug administration. Plasma was assayed for adinazolam and mono-desmethyl-adinazolam (NDMAD) concentrations by a specific HPLC technique. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated by noncompartmental methods. Psychomotor effects of adinazolam were assessed using a digit-symbol substitution test (DSST) and aiming test (AIM). Memory effects were assessed by a modification of the Randt memory test (MEM); sedation was assessed using an observer-rated scale. Differences in pharmacokinetics of the parent drug were noted: adinazolam oral clearance was lower in patients with cirrhosis (35.0 +/- 27.9 L/hr) than in normal subjects (73.7 +/- 22.1 L/hr; P = .024); Kel was significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis (.126 +/- .084 vs. .278 +/- .070; P = .007), whereas the mean t1/2 in patients with cirrhosis was 7.70 hours as compared with 2.67 hours in normal subjects. Cmax was higher in the group with cirrhosis (266 +/- 95.5 vs. 153 +/- 29.3 ng/mL; P = .019). For NDMAD, Kel was lower in cirrhotic subjects and resulted in a prolonged t1/2 in cirrhotic subjects compared with normal subjects (6.70 vs. 3.79 hr; P = .0152). NDMAD AUC tended to be higher in cirrhotic subjects (1515 +/- 254 vs. 1162 +/- 254 ng.hr/mL; P = .064).

    "35": "In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam and its active metabolite, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, were determined in 12 normal subjects and 12 dialysis patients [7 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 5 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients]. Blood samples were collected over 48 hours after alprazolam 0.5 mg and alprazolam 2 mg administration. Alprazolam and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam concentrations and alprazolam free fraction were determined. The pharmacokinetics of alprazolam were similar in normal subjects and HD patients with the exception of higher free fraction in HD patients. Differences were detected, however, in the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam in CAPD patients when compared with normal subjects and HD patients. These differences included a higher free fraction and a lower apparent oral clearance and free clearance in CAPD patients than in normal subjects or in HD patients. There was also a tendency for a later Tmax and a longer elimination half-life in CAPD patients than in normal subjects or HD patients. Alpha-hydroxyalprazolam concentrations were less than 15% of corresponding alprazolam concentrations in normal subjects and dialysis patients. Thus, end-stage renal disease is associated with changes in absorption, distribution, and/or elimination of alprazolam.",

The group receiving clonazepam showed significantly more improvement in their manic but not their psychotic symptoms compared to the placebo group. This effect was not primarily related to the sedative effects of clonazepam. Clonazepam tended to reduce the need for phenothiazine medication. Side effects related to sedation were more common to the clonazepam group. These findings are the first to indicate that clonazepam may have a specific antimanic effect over and above that of phenothiazines alone.",

The investigation compared 37 men who were family history positive for alcoholism with 37 family history negative controls on postinfusion levels of cortisol, prolactin, and growth hormone following 0.12 and 0.20 mg/kg of diazepam given IV over 7 minutes. The results demonstrated no evidence of a decreased response for the sons of alcoholics on the levels of these three hormones.", 
    "38": "This research investigated the effects of Ro15-4513 (Ro15), a partial inverse benzodiazepine agonist, on the drinking behavior of 23-1/2 hr fluid deprived rats. Water-deprived rats were maintained on a two-bottle regimen of a saccharin-ETOH solution along with tap water available for 30 min/day for several days. Following this acclimation period, animals were pretreated with either Ro15 (1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg) or Tween-80 vehicle injections. Pretreatment with Ro15 at all doses tested resulted in a significant reduction of the saccharin-ETOH solution; however, Ro15 did not alter the rats' consumption of water. The effects of Ro15 on general fluid consumption was investigated in Experiment 2. Following acclimation to a two-bottle regimen of a saccharin-solution and tap water 30 min/day, naive animals were pretreated with Tween-80 vehicle or Ro15 injections. Ro15 failed to alter saccharin or water consumption. The results of this study support previous reports suggesting that Ro15 attenuates the oral consumption of ETOH; however, this effect does not appear to be due to a general suppression of fluid intake.",

Fifty percent of patients who received epidural anaesthesia shivered compared to 19% of patients who received either spinal or caudal anaesthesia. None of the patients who had brachial block shivered. Intravenous injection of 25 mg pethidine would stop shivering in almost all patients who shivered during regional blocks.",

It is well absorbed, rapidly effective, and generally accepted as being safe when used in this manner. The effect of intravenous diazepam solution on the rectal mucosa has not been studied. This study demonstrates that there are no acute changes in the rectal mucosa of adult rats after administration of 10 to 20 times the recommended human dose.", 
    "41": "1. The gastropyloric receptor (GPR) cells are stretch-sensitive muscle receptors in the crab stomatogastric nervous system that use both 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and acetylcholine as cotransmitters. Brief stimulation of these afferent neurons causes two gastric mill neurons to be recruited into the pyloric motor pattern. 2. The GPR cells evoke complex synaptic potentials in the lateral gastric (LG) and medial gastric (MG) motor neurons, two component neurons of the gastric mill central pattern generator. When the gastric mill is quiescent (as often happens in vivo), GPR stimulation transiently inhibits LG and MG. After this transient inhibition, these cells undergo a prolonged excitation during which they fire bursts of action potentials at a constant phase relation to the pyloric motor pattern. 3. To determine the causes for this effect, we examined the effects of GPR stimulation on these two cells and on the inferior cardiac motor neuron, which is electrically coupled to them. When GPR is stimulated, all three cells receive rapid biphasic synaptic potentials that are blocked by nicotinic antagonists, followed by a slow, prolonged depolarizing potential. 4. The slow, prolonged depolarizing potential is not blocked by nicotinic or muscarinic cholinergic antagonists but is mimicked and occluded by exogenously applied serotonin. 5. The prolonged excitation, mediated at least in part by serotonin, may be responsible for the recruitment of the gastric mill neurons into the pyloric motor pattern. Thus sensory input can directly exert prolonged modulatory effects that change the functional cellular composition of pattern-generating circuits.", 
    "42": "Midazolam concentration curves versus time were analysed in 10 otherwise healthy patients (ASA I-II) with inferior limb pathologies. The benzodiazepine was used as an adjuvant agent to epidural anaesthesia in view of its lower residual effect compared with other intravenous benzodiazepines. Midazolam pharmacokinetics in these patients fitted an open two-compartment model. The plasma levels versus time corresponded to a biexponential process with a very rapid distribution phase (t1/2a = 5.7 +/- 2.4 min) and an elimination phase (t1/2 beta = 66 +/- 37 min). Mean values for distribution volumes in the central compartment and extrapolated values were Vc = 0.12 +/- 0.04 l/kg and V beta = 1.28 +/- 0.92 l/kg. This kinetic behaviour explains the rapid but short duration of midazolam action. The induction time, estimated from the start of hypnosis (eye closure), was from 60 to 120 s with i.v. injection. The duration of action for the dose administered was from 15 to 60 min, with plasma levels below 90 ng/ml upon eye opening.", 
    "43": "The effect of extreme old age on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally administered oxazepam 15 mg was studied in 10 healthy elderly (age 80-94 years) institutionalised subjects and 10 healthy young controls (age 26-42 years). The total oxazepam clearance was 1.24 (0.91-1.80) ml min-1 kg-1 (median and range) and 1.44 (0.88-2.13) ml min-1 kg-1 in the elderly and young, respectively (NS), and the elimination half-lives were 8.1 (5.5-10.8) h and 5.7 (4.9-6.2) h. respectively (P less than 0.01). The percent of unbound oxazepam was greater in the elderly; 9.8 (8.1-13.3)% as opposed to 5.1 (3.7-5.9)% in the young (P less than 0.0001). Clearance of unbound oxazepam was lower in the elderly, median values being 13.8 (7.1-21.1) ml min-1 kg-1 compared with 30.3 (18.3-41.5) ml min-1 kg-1 in the young (P less than 0.0001). A single 15 mg dose oxazepam decreased the ability of the elderly to perform a finger tapping test at 3 h but not 8 h after drug administration, whereas placebo had no effect at either times. No effect was observed in the young subjects.", 
    "44": "Changes in a test of memory performance were evaluated in 103 healthy young men after challenges with placebo and two different doses of intravenous diazepam (0.12 and 0.20 mg/kg). Both diazepam doses significantly impaired free recall in a dose-dependent manner. Within each dose challenge there was no significant correlation between the average serum diazepam or desmethyldiazepam levels and the average number of words recalled across the time points. The data expand our current understanding of the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines and suggest that patients abusing these drugs in large doses may develop profound degrees of memory impairment.", 
    "45": "Maudsley reactive (MR/Har) and nonreactive (MNRA/Har) rats (Rattus norvegicus) were tested in successive, simultaneous, and anticipatory contrast procedures. The MR/Har rats showed smaller successive negative contrast effects than the MNRA/Har rats when shifted from 32% to 4% sucrose, and the degree of contrast was smaller in animals of both strains than that typically obtained with unselected Sprague-Dawley derived rats. Chlordiazepoxide (4 and 8 mg/kg), which typically reduces contrast, did not influence degree of contrast in rats of either strain. Animals of both strains showed positive and negative contrast in the simultaneous contrast procedure, but degree of contrast in both cases was smaller in rats of the MR/Har strain. Animals of both strains also showed anticipatory contrast when a 0.15% saccharin solution preceded 32% sucrose in once-per-day pairings. In terms of latency to initiate licking, the MNRA/Har rats showed a contrast effect, but the MR/Har rats showed a \"reinforcement\" effect--shorter latency when saccharin preceded sucrose than when saccharin preceded saccharin. Open-field tests showed typical strain differences: The MNRA/Har rats ambulated more, reared more, defecated less, and showed less thigmotaxis than the MR/Har rats.", 
    "46": "Poisoning prevention strategies have to be modified according to the risk variations with age and time. Epidemiologic surveillance usefulness was confirmed by studying the 0-15 y-old children in the Trieste area from 1976-1987. Significant differences were observed in children under 5 due to an increase in caustic substance and home detergents poisoning and a decrease in analgesic-antipyretics ingestion. This was probably due to the introduction by law in our country of child-resistant containers and to a better awareness by parents. At 10 y-of-age and older, alcohol is the cause of most intoxications and more recently benzodiazepine poisonings have significantly increased. At this age poisoning results from deliberate ingestion in most cases; therefore education should be the main preventive strategy.", 
    "47": "The gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine receptor complexes from bovine cerebral cortex were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, and the main component peptide subunits were characterized. The peptide band originally thought to be a single beta subunit [57,000 Mr band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)] is composed of at least four different peptides of 54,000-57,000 Mr. Two peptides of 55,000 and 57,000 Mr were recognized by the beta subunit-specific monoclonal antibody 62-3G1. Peptides in the range of 54,000-57,000 Mr were photoaffinity-labeled with [3H]muscimol. A different 57,000 Mr peptide was photoaffinity-labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam, but neither was recognized by the monoclonal antibody 62-3G1 nor photoaffinity-labeled with [3H]muscimol. Some peptides could be identified by their differential mobility shift in SDS-PAGE after treatment with endoglycosidase H. Two additional subunit peptides of 51,000 and 53,000 Mr were also photoaffinity-labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam and reacted with antiserum A.

    "49": "In mice, isolation-induced social behavioural deficits are attenuated by stimulants of 5-HT1B receptors, such as TFMPP or CGS 120 66B. Repeated treatment with RU 24969 (5 mg/kg, daily, for 3 days) reduced the effect of TFMPP and that of other 5-HT1B agonists (CGS 120 66B, m-CPP, RU 24969). Similarly, repeated treatment with CGS 120 66B (8 mg/kg, twice a day for 3 days) abolished the effect of a test-dose of the same drug. Desensitization of the 5-HT1B receptors involved in this effect is suggested to have occurred. Such a desensitization may be therapeutically relevant, since acute administration of benzodiazepines and chronic administration of antidepressants both reversed the effect of TFMPP.",

Cyclosporine therapy has been a major factor in extending homograft survival, but recent studies have suggested that cyclosporine administration increases the duration of action of some anesthetics. The authors evaluated the influence on anesthetic management of cardiac transplantation and chronic cyclosporine therapy in a retrospective review of all postcardiac transplant patients who presented for noncardiac surgery at the study institution. The data suggest that a number of commonly used anesthetic techniques can be administered safely to these patients when no evidence of graft rejection is present.

Of the 6 patients with frequent seizures, 2 were subsequently diagnosed as having CPS and SPS, respectively. Patients who did not respond to CPZ included those in whom the diagnosis of BECCT should be reconfirmed, and electro-clinical response may be also useful for diagnosing RD. 3) In patients treated with CZP alone for a short-term treatment of BECCT, the drug administration could be discontinued only in one.

To evaluate the effect of MK-329 on CCK-stimulated pancreaticobiliary output in man, six normal subjects received 10 mg MK-329 or placebo orally in a randomized, crossover fashion, before a background intravenous infusion of secretin (5 pmol/kg/h) and two doses of CCK-8 (approximately 15 and 40 pmol/kg/h, each for 1 h). Gastric and duodenal juice were aspirated separately via two double-lumen tubes, with 51Cr-ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid as a duodenal marker. After placebo treatment the background infusion of secretin produced maximum plasma concentrations of secretin similar to postprandial values, averaging about 5 pM. After placebo treatment the low dose CCK-8 infusion (15 pmol/kg/h) increased circulating CCK concentrations from basal levels of 1.8 +/- 0.2 pM to levels similar to those observed postprandially, averaging 9.2 +/- 1.3 pM, and the high dose of CCK-8 (40 pmol/kg/h) induced supraphysiologic levels of CCK, averaging 23.4 +/- 3.2 pM. Plasma concentrations of secretin and CCK were not significantly different during MK-329 treatment. As expected, infusion of CCK-8 at both doses stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion and gallbladder contraction in placebo controls, as indicated by increases in the output of trypsin, amylase, bicarbonate, and bilirubin. Whereas MK-329 did not significantly reduce basal pancreatic secretion, the integrated incremental output of trypsin, amylase, and bicarbonate in response to stimulation with the low (physiologic) CCK dose was inhibited by 74% (p less than 0.01), 89% (NS), and 75% (p less than 0.05), respectively. Basal bilirubin output was virtually abolished after treatment with MK-329, and the response to the low dose of CCK was reduced by 98% (p less than 0.01), indicating almost complete inhibition of gallbladder contraction at physiologic circulating concentrations of CCK. It is concluded that MK-329 is an orally active antagonist of CCK-stimulated pancreaticobiliary output in man and could thus be utilized to explore the physiologic regulation of the exocrine pancreas and gallbladder by CCK.", 
    "53": "To study the interdependence between gastric histamine release and acid secretion, we examined the effects of gastrin-(1-17) [G-(1-17)] or cholecystokinin-(1-33) [CCK-(1-33)] alone or combined with the gastrin (CCK-B) antagonist L365,260 or the CCK-A antagonist L364,718 in the isolated vascularly perfused rat stomach. G-(1-17) and CCK-(1-33) gave concentration-dependent increases in acid secretion and histamine release. Gastrin or CCK-A antagonist alone did not stimulate histamine release or acid secretion. Maximally G-(1-17) or CCK-(1-33) stimulated histamine release and acid secretion was unchanged by the CCK-A antagonist, while the gastrin antagonist induced a parallel and concentration-dependent decrease in stimulated histamine and acid secretion. We conclude that G-(1-17) and CCK-(1-33) stimulate histamine and acid secretion by a CCK-B (gastrin) receptor. The present results indicate that gastrin, at least in this species, stimulates acid secretion by releasing histamine.",

    "55": "The increasing importance of intravenous anaesthesia is based on two developments, namely the synthesis of substances capable of acting selectively and over the short term, and which are rapidly eliminated (good control), and a desire on the part of the anaesthetist to have an anaesthetic whose actions can be controlled in various ways. Efforts in this area are aimed at ensuring not only a minimum of stressing of organs by the anaesthetic, but also a minimisation of risks during the intra-operative phase, and a non-problematic maximally pleasant post-operative course. There are two problems that militate against the realization of these objectives. Although the substances presented here ideally permit the realization of some of these aims, at the same time they are associated with side effects that prevent their use from ever being completely non-problematical, and which should always prompt the exercise of particular care when employing these medications. In addition, the differentiable control made possible by the use of these drugs is (partly) offset by inadequate monitoring with respect to the qualities of the anaesthetic--a fact that modifies the potential advantages of intravenous anaesthesia.", 
    "56": "The inhibition constant (Ki) of U-78875 was investigated without and with muscimol in the incubation medium using in vitro (3H)-flunitrazepam [(3H)-FNZ] binding to cortical membrane preparation. Also, the effect of U-78875 on cerebellar cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was studied in control and stressed (electric footshock) mice. The Ki of U-78875 was 1.56 nM for inhibition of (3H)-FNZ binding. The presence of muscimol (10(-5) M) had no significant effect on the Ki of U-78875. U-78875 and diazepam significantly decreased cerebellar cGMP, and this effect was antagonized by flumazenil. Both U-78875 and diazepam dose-dependently antagonized electric footshock-induced increases in cGMP, and U-78875 was two orders of magnitude more potent in stressed animals as compared to control animals. These biochemical investigations indicate that U-78875 is an agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, and cGMP may mediate its anxiolytic activity.", 
    "57": "This paper represents a comprehensive review of laboratory studies investigating the abuse liability of anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs in humans. The subjective effects of these drugs, most of which are either barbiturates or benzodiazepines, have been measured using various self-report questionnaires and their reinforcing effects have been studied using self-administration and choice procedures. Studies using both subjective and reinforcing effects reveal orderly relations between the two main chemical classes of anxiolytic/hypnotics (e.g. barbiturates are associated with higher abuse liability than benzodiazepines), between different doses of the drugs (e.g. higher doses are usually associated with higher abuse liability) and among different compounds within a class. The subjective and reinforcing effects of barbiturates and benzodiazepines depend critically upon the subject populations that are tested and it is argued that individuals with histories of drug abuse provide a more sensitive indicator of abuse liability than healthy volunteers. Several principles of abuse liability testing are discussed, including the selection of an appropriate subject population, the use of blind drug administration procedures, the comparison of a test compound to an appropriate standard, the inclusion of a placebo and a wide range of doses of the test drug and the use of multiple measures of likelihood of abuse.", 
    "58": "A patient with incapacitating restless-leg syndrome had suffered from repetitive confusional states exclusively after use of short-acting benzodiazepines. Complete removal of symptoms was achieved using levodopa. An association between many reported adverse reactions to triazolam and the common syndrome of restless legs or nocturnal myoclonus is suggested.", 
    "59": "Benzodiazepines are among the most widely used therapeutic drugs because of their sedative and anxiolytic effects mediated through modulation of GABAA receptors. Another recognition site for these drugs, termed the peripheral-type (or mitochondrial) benzodiazepine receptor, is much more prevalent throughout the body for which a physiologic and pharmacologic role has just been found. This drug receptor plays a central role in the regulation of steroidogenesis by mediating the rate-limiting step in this biosynthetic pathway, which is transport of cholesterol to inner mitochondrial membranes. Although once considered by many to be an insignificant drug-binding site because a specific function remained elusive for many years, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors are now viewed with renewed interest because certain benzodiazepines such as diazepam may exert secondary effects on steroid production under appropriate physiologic conditions. Elucidation of this receptorial role should initiate new studies to examine in more detail the pharmacologic profile of drugs that bind to these sites and provides a novel target for the treatment of certain types of endocrine disorders.", 
    "60": "The literature concerning the effect of race and ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of psychotropic drugs is reviewed, and recommendations concerning the use of these agents are presented. While no differences in the pharmacokinetics of dosage requirements of antipsychotic drugs have been demonstrated among black, Hispanic, and white persons, Asians seem to have a lower threshold for both the therapeutic and adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs than do Caucasians. Use of lower than usual initial dosages of antipsychotic drugs in Asian patients appears to be prudent. Although ethnicity may have an effect on antidepressant drug pharmacology and dosage requirements, the available data are not sufficiently convincing to make any dosage recommendations. Claims that Asians require lower dosages of lithium than do other ethnic groups are not supported by the available evidence. Higher plasma benzodiazepine concentrations and lower drug clearance observed in Asians compared with Caucasians are consistent with clinical observations of lower dosage requirements for Asian patients; smaller than usual dosages of these agents are recommended for Asian patients. Interracial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences for psychotropic drugs can affect clinical outcomes. Further study of this issue is warranted.", 
    "61": "The clinical use of neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, narcotic analgesics, barbiturates, and neuromuscular blockers to manage delirium and agitation in the intensive-care setting is reviewed. Delirium is the most commonly encountered mental disturbance in critically ill patients and may be precipitated by factors such as physical illness, medications, pain, and emotional stress. If agitation cannot be controlled through nonpharmacologic means, pharmacologic intervention may be necessary. Haloperidol is the neuroleptic of choice for rapid control of delirium and agitation in the critically ill patient. It has few adverse effects in most patients, even at high doses, although it can cause extrapyramidal symptoms. Among the benzodiazepines, lorazepam should be considered a first-line agent. It may be used alone or in combination with haloperidol (or another neuroleptic). Midazolam is suitable for administration by continuous i.v. infusion in the intensive-care setting because of its water solubility, short half-life, and short duration of action. The sedative effects of narcotics may be advantageous in patients with both agitation and pain. Barbiturates are not recommended for routine use in the treatment of delirium and agitation. The use of neuromuscular blocking agents such as pancuronium bromide and metocurine iodide may be necessary when other therapies have failed. Haloperidol and the benzodiazepines, alone or in combination, are the drugs of choice for treatment of acute agitation and delirium in critically ill patients.", 
    "62": "Hard data on the efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer's disease are not available. Short-acting benzodiazepines, such as oxazepam, appear safer than long-acting benzodiazepines and more efficient than placebo in the short-term (4-8 weeks) treatment of behavioral disturbances in geriatric, psychogeriatric, and demented patients. It is unknown whether oxazepam is superior to neuroleptic drugs or other commonly prescribed sedatives in this context. To some extent these findings may apply to patients with Alzheimer's disease as well, but there are several arguments against an uncritical extrapolation of conclusions drawn from other geriatric populations to patients with Alzheimer's disease. When, despite the lack of well-founded knowledge in this field, such a treatment modality is chosen, short-acting benzodiazepines should be preferred over long-acting agents. Drug interactions and pharmacokinetic aspects of the specific agent in the individual patient should always be considered carefully. Future studies on the treatment of behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer's disease need to clarify which specific behavioral symptoms should be treated pharmacologically, which therapeutic agents have the most advantageous risk-benefit ratio in this context, and what is the optimal treatment duration.", 
    "63": "With the use of the shock-induced suppression of water drinking in thirsty rats (Vogel's conflict paradigm) and the pentylenetetrazole-enhanced shock-induced suppression of drinking (proconflict paradigm) as animal models to test anxiolytic and antipanic agents, it was possible to distinguish two major classes of benzodiazepines (BZDs) and congeners on the basis of their antiproconflict index (ratio of anticonflict/antiproconflict potencies). Thus, typical low potency BZDs and congeners (diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem, alpidem) with anxiolytic/hypnotic properties have a low antiproconflict index (close to 1), whereas typical high potency BZDs (clonazepam, alprazolam, bretazenil) with reported antipanic properties have an antiproconflict index approximately 10-fold higher. The anticonflict and antiproconflict actions of BZDs with low or high antiproconflict indices are blocked by flumazenil but are potentiated differentially by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake blocker 1-2-[bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-methoxyethyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3- pyridine-carboxylic acid. Protracted administration of antianxiety and antipanic antidepressant drugs that do not act on GABAA receptors, directly, resulted in anticonflict and antiproconflict effects. However, the efficacy of these drugs is clearly inferior (20-30%) to that of BZDs. These data suggest that specific GABAA receptor subtypes mediate the pharmacological action of BZDs possessing low and high antiproconflict indices.", 
    "64": "Benzodiazepines, either alone or added to neuroleptics, have been studied extensively as treatments for schizophrenia, but no consensus regarding their efficacy has been reached. The authors review the double-blind trials in the literature and relate the findings to the neurobiology of benzodiazepine actions.", 
    "65": "The clinical review included all double-blind studies through 1989 that could be identified by means of Index Medicus and computer-assisted searches and by the cross-referencing of articles. The findings from the 14 studies of benzodiazepines used alone and the 16 studies of adjunctive therapy are presented separately.", 
    "66": "The studies reviewed suggest that 1) response is highly variable, and about one-third to one-half of patients improve; 2) benzodiazepines are potentially most useful as adjuncts to neuroleptics in the acute management of psychotic agitation, although actual antipsychotic effects have also been observed in some patients; 3) relatively higher doses of benzodiazepines may be associated with better response; and 4) therapeutic effects, when seen, develop rapidly but diminish after several weeks in some patients. The authors explore the neurobiological bases of benzodiazepine action, which presumably underlie their efficacy in schizophrenia and may help explain the variability of response.", 
    "67": "Future research on benzodiazepines in the treatment of schizophrenia should focus on features that predict response, the relation of dopamine or other neurotransmitter systems to therapeutic effects, the schizophrenic symptoms most amenable to benzodiazepine treatment, changes in neuroleptic dose during benzodiazepine augmentation, the role of benzodiazepines in maintenance therapy, and the optimal characteristics of benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "68": "The anticonvulsive efficacy of flumazenil, a specific antagonist of the ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor, was studied in the experimental seizures induced by electrical stimulation of corpus Amygdaloideum and Cornu Ammonis dorsale of the hippocampus in rabbits. In the amygdaloid seizure model flumazenil raised the threshold and/or reduced the afterdischarge duration. Results observed in the seizures induced by stimulation of hippocampus were less consistent. Possible explanations are discussed.", 
    "69": "Dihydroxyaflavinine is an indole-derived metabolite of Aspergillus flavus. Its action on GABA-induced response was quantitatively studied on the GABAA receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes after injection of chick brain mRNA under voltage-clamp conditions. Dihydroxyaflavinine inhibits GABA-induced current non-competitively with KI = 12 mumol/L. This blockage is rapidly reversible. In comparison, the inhibitory effect of penicillin on GABAA receptor is enhanced by increasing GABA concentration. Ro 15-1788 (a benzodiazepine ligand with KD = 0.6--2 nmol/L) of concentration as high as 1 mumol/L, does not mask the action of 10 mumol/L dihydroxyaflavinine, indicating that dihydroxyaflavinine acts on a site different from benzodiazepines. Dihydroxyaflavinine appears to expedite desensitization of the receptor, which is similar to the action of picrotoxin and in contrast with that of penicillin and bicuculline.", 
    "70": "Amitriptyline inhibits the GABA-mediated uptake of 36Cl- in membrane vesicles prepared from the cerebral cortices of drug-naive and saline-treated rats. In contrast, chronic in vivo treatment with amitriptyline affects an increase in the GABA-stimulated uptake of chloride ions in its presence. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZK 93426 blocks the capacity of amitriptyline to augment the uptake of 36Cl- by 30 microM GABA. There is a possibility that there are two distinct effects of amitriptyline's action in the rat forebrain. The first is evident in vesicles from drug-naive animals and the second only after chronic treatment with this antidepressant. The authors discuss the pertinence of this finding to the mechanism of action of amitriptyline.", 
    "71": "Rats chronically drank either water or midazolam solution (0.1 mg/ml) in daily, 3-h schedule-induced polydipsia sessions and were evaluated in daily motor control sessions after polydipsia when midazolam metabolite levels had fallen to zero (withdrawal). Under midazolam polydipsia, animals orally self-administered between 21 and 38 mg/kg daily. The effect of acute drug administration [midazolam (0.75-3 mg/kg, SC), FG 7142 (1-8 mg/kg, IP), Ro 15-1788 (10-20 mg/kg, IP)] on motor control performance was similar after either chronic water or midazolam polydipsia. Thus chronic, oral midazolam self-administration did not lead to tolerance to the motor impairment produced by SC midazolam, nor did the daily discontinuation lead to impaired motor performance, nor had these performances, which occurred after daily elevated midazolam metabolite levels had reached zero (withdrawal), become sensitized to the effects of either the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 or the agonist Ro 15-1788.", 
    "72": "The effect of chronic alcoholism and detoxification treatment with disulfiram on platelet peripheral benzodiazepine receptors was studied in alcoholic males. Chronic consumption of alcohol did not alter the binding values for [3H]PK 11195, as compared to non-alcoholics. Treatment for 3 weeks with disulfiram resulted in a significant increase in the density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, with no alteration in the affinity of these sites to the ligand. These results might be relevant to the cellular and metabolic effects of disulfiram.", 
    "73": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether melatonin-induced depression of locomotor activity in hamsters is time-dependent and to analyze the inhibitory effects of the central-type benzodiazepine (BZP) antagonist Ro 15-1788 on melatonin-induced depression of locomotor behavior. Activity was monitored and registered by means of an optical actometer. Two phases of locomotor behavior were found. The initial phase, found both at noon and during the evening, exhibited an absence of diurnal variability, while a second long-lasting phase of activity exhibited a peak at early night. The IP injection of melatonin (minimal effective dose: 100 micrograms/kg) inhibited the early phase of activity at 1200 or 2000 h. Inhibition of the late phase of activity was found at 2000 or 0400 h, but not at midnight. When assessed at 2000 h, melatonin depression of the early phase of locomotor activity attained significance after 5 days of injection, while its effect on the late phase of activity attained significance during the second day of injection. The administration of Ro 15-1788, although unable by itself to modify locomotor activity, significantly attenuated the inhibitory effects of melatonin. These results indicate the existence of a time-dependency for melatonin activity on locomotor behavior similar to that known to occur for other effects of the hormone, and further support a link between melatonin and the activity of central type BZP receptors.", 
    "74": "In comparison with the literature data the pharmacological effects of muscimol (MS) on mice organism were studied under the condition of administration of the exogenic ligands of GABA-receptor complex GABA antagonist bicuculline (BC), chloride ionophor blocking agent pentylenetetrazole (PZ), phenazepam (BD), sodium barbital (BB) and GABA synthesis antagonist--thiosemicarbazide (TS). Antagonism of MS to the anticonvulsant effect of BB and BD at the administration of BC to the animal was observed, while no effect was observed at the administration of PZ. However at the administration of TS to the experimental animals MS exhibits anticonvulsant effect. The observed properties (partial agonism/partial reverse agonism) of MS at its effect to the whole system are probably determined by the level of endogenic GABA and its changes due to the administration of TS and functional state of GABA--receptor system modified with the exogenic ligand BC.", 
    "75": "Atherosclerosis is characterized by increased endothelial permeability, monocyte infiltration, intimal smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, platelet aggregation and the accumulation of lipids, calcium and extracellular matrix components in the vessel wall. In various animal studies and recently in humans it could be established that Ca2+ channel blockers delayed the progression of the atherosclerotic process at the stage of early lesions. This review surveys the interaction of Ca2+ channel blockers with various membrane proteins (purinergic receptors, nucleoside transporter, peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, multi-drug resistance protein) which are involved in signal transduction and their potential impact on the observed antiatherosclerotic effects. Although the precise mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, it has been clearly shown that these drugs inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, improve cellular lipoprotein metabolism in vascular cells, alter phospholipid turnover, decrease platelet adhesion in the vessel wall, reduce extracellular matrix synthesis and protect against radical induced cell damage. Most of these effects are independent of Ca2+ flux across voltage-operated Ca2+ channels. However, all these processes are relevant to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and therefore the elucidation of the antiatherogenic mechanisms of Ca2+ channel blockers at the cellular level is of great interest. The future development of Ca2+ channel blockers with altered molecular structures optimized for their antiatherosclerotic targets may provide a useful tool in the therapy of atherosclerosis and risk factor intervention. The protective mechanisms are related to a stabilization of cell membrane integrity, the modulation of secretory activities and cell/cell communication processes rather than to a lowering of plasma lipoprotein levels.", 
    "76": "1. Slices of rat cuneate nucleus were used to study whether or not gonadal steroids influence the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system in vivo. Females in different stages of the oestrous cycle as well as steroid-treated (oestrogen, progesterone or both) ovariectomized animals were used. 2. Functional changes in the GABAA receptors were assayed using the effects of potentiators (benzodiazepine, barbiturate) and antagonists (picrotoxin) on the muscimol control dose-response curves. 3. The potentiating effect of the benzodiazepine, flurazepam was unchanged during the oestrous cycle, and the hormone treatments did not alter this effect. 4. During oestrus, an increase was seen in the potentiating effect of the barbiturate (pentobarbitone). This suggests a synergistic effect between barbiturates and gonadal steroids. Progesterone treatment also increased the effect of pentobarbitone. 5. The antagonistic action of picrotoxin was unaffected during the oestrous cycle. However, progesterone (or progesterone and oestrogen) treatment reduced the potency of picrotoxin. 6. This study supports the idea that endogenous steroids (presumably progesterone) affect the GABAA receptors during the oestrous cycle by a mechanism associated with the barbiturate site of the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "77": "Chronic benzodiazepine administration has been associated with alterations in binding and function at the GABAA receptor. To evaluate effects of chronic benzodiazepine exposure on messenger RNA (mRNA) concentrations for several GABAA receptor subunits, we treated mice with lorazepam, 2 mg kg-1 daily for 1-28 days and evaluated mRNAs for the alpha 1 and gamma 2 subunits by Northern hybridization. In cerebral cortex, concentrations of mRNA for the alpha 1 and gamma 2 subunits were unchanged from vehicle or control after 1-10 days of lorazepam. However, after 14 days of treatment mRNA concentrations for both subunits decreased to approximately 50% of control values and remained decreased at 28 days. In contrast, no significant alterations were observed for either subunit mRNA in hippocampus or cerebellum over the same time course. Alterations in mRNAs in cortex occur after the development of tolerance and receptor downregulation in this model.", 
    "78": "Chronic benzodiazepine administration is associated with the development of tolerance and dependence. To evaluate the cellular mechanisms for these phenomena the authors developed a mouse model of chronic benzodiazepine exposure. The benzodiazepine agonists lorazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam produced tolerance in this system, which was associated in each case with benzodiazepine and GABAA receptor downregulation. After discontinuation, a syndrome that included increased motor activity and receptor upregulation occurred with each of these compounds. A benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, and an inverse agonist, FG 7142, were associated with receptor upregulation and increased activity during chronic administration. In contrast, a partial agonist (Ro16-6028) did not produce tolerance or receptor changes. Similar results were obtained in a culture system for clonazepam, flumazenil, and FG 7142. The increase in receptor binding after lorazepam discontinuation may be due to enhanced receptor synthesis. Changes in gene expression for GABAA receptor subunits also occur with chronic lorazepam administration, and they follow alterations in binding.", 
    "79": "3-Acyloxy-, 3-methoxy-, and 3-alkyl-substituted derivatives of the benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist desmethyl-diazepam (DMD) were resolved, and the stereochemical properties of binding to central BZ receptors were investigated in synaptosomal membrane preparations of rat brain. Decreasing potency and stereoselectivity of 3-methyl, 3-ethyl, and 3-isopropyl derivatives in displacement of [3H]diazepam binding can be attributed to differential susceptibilities for steric hindrance of 3-axial versus 3-equatorial substituents of the binding conformation M. Chirality in the alpha-methyl-beta-phenyl-propionic acyl moiety of oxazepam, the 3-OH-derivative of DMD, was noncritical in binding, whereas the beta-phenyl substituent selectively increased the binding of the 3S-stereoisomer. Changing the pH from 7.4 to 5.6 significantly increased the IC50 of (3R)-oxazepam acetate but not those of (3R)-methyl-DMD and diazepam. Binding data led to a steric model of the BZ binding site with the postulation of an additional hydrogen-bond-donating moiety, probably histidine in the \"ceiling\" of the receptor cavity, that binds the 3-carbonyloxy groups and hinders the 3-alkyl ones. In vitro efficacies of 3-substituted BZs were estimated by allosteric binding interactions within the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor-ionophore complex. Non-equilibrium enhancement of t-butyl-bicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate binding by the BZ agonist oxazepam was stereoselectively antagonized by (3S)-oxazepam-(S)-alpha-methyl-beta-phenyl-propionate, suggesting a mixed agonist-antagonist character. GABA enhanced the [3H]diazepam-displacing potencies of the 3S-enantiomers of the acetate, hemisuccinate, and (S)-alpha-methyl-beta-phenyl-propionate esters of oxazepam by a factor of about 1.5-1.6, whereas the GABA shifts for 3R-esters were about 1.2. UV affinity labeling with flunitrazepam resulted in a significantly smaller decrease in the displacing potency of (3R)-oxazepam acetate than in that of the 3S-enantiomer. GABA shifts of successively 3-methylated DMD derivatives were also compared. The GABA shifts of DMD and its (3S)-methyl and 3,3-dimethyl derivatives were all characteristic of full agonists (2.4-2.7), whereas that of (3R)-methyl-DMD was 1.5. The 3-methoxy enantiomers of DMD displayed stereoselectivity and GABA shift values intermediate between those of 3-methyl and 3-acetoxy derivatives. These allosteric interactions suggest that 3-carbonyloxy derivatives in general, as well as (3R)-BZ enantiomers bound with axial 3-alkyl and 3-alkyloxy groups, decrease the agonist efficacies of 1,4-BZs to modulate the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "80": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated Cl- currents in neonatal rat cortical neurons and in cultured cells engineered for the expression of specific molecular forms of the GABAA receptor alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, were recorded with the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. The effects of various allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors were determined. Diazepam and clonazepam showed greater efficacy as positive modulators of GABA-elicited currents in alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 2 or alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2 receptors than in alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 or alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 2 receptors or in cortical neurons. Alpidem was more efficacious at alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 or alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 2 receptors than at alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2 or alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 2 receptors or in cortical neurons. Conversely, zolpidem was equally efficacious for all these receptors except for alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 2. Both imidazopyridines (alpidem and zolpidem) were virtually ineffective at modulating the GABA response of alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 2 receptors and in almost all the receptors assembled from alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3 or alpha 5 subunits together with beta 1 and gamma 1 subunits. The beta-carboline derivatives methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) and methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) elicited a positive allosteric modulation of alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1 or alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 1 receptors, whereas they acted as negative allosteric modulators at nearly all other receptors tested, as they do in cortical neurons. Although the positive allosteric modulation by beta-carbolines never exceeded a doubling of the GABA response, DMCM was more efficacious at alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1 receptors and beta-CCM was more efficacious at alpha 2 beta 1 gamma 1 receptors. DMCM was inactive at alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 1 receptors, whereas beta-CCM was virtually inactive at alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 1 receptors. The benzodiazepine 4'-chlorodiazepam, which is a negative modulator resistent to flumazenil inhibition, acted at all the various GABAA receptors that contained a gamma subunit.", 
    "81": "Chronic exposure to ethanol is associated with the development of tolerance to the acute effects of ethanol and a withdrawal syndrome characterized by anxiety and seizure susceptibility. In the present study we examined the ability of flumazenil (Ro15-1788), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, to reverse neuronal and behavioral manifestations of ethanol tolerance and dependence. A single injection of flumazenil (10 mg/kg, 14 hr before withdrawal) to mice administered a liquid diet containing ethanol for 10 days, reduced seizure severity during withdrawal from ethanol. Acute tolerance to ethanol-induced hypothermia was not sensitive to flumazenil treatment, but tolerance and diazepam-induced cross-tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol were reversed by a single injection of flumazenil given 2 to 26 hr before evaluation of tolerance. At a biochemical level, the ability of benzodiazepine inverse agonists (e.g., Ro15-4513) to reduce the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-operated chloride channels may represent a neuronal manifestation of ethanol dependence (Buck and Harris, 1990). Flumazenil treatment of ethanol-dependent mice 14 hr before isolation of brain membrane vesicles partially reversed the augmentation of Ro15-4513 inhibition of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in vitro. These results demonstrate that brief occupation of benzodiazepine receptors by an antagonist may reset the cellular mechanisms responsible for the development of ethanol tolerance and dependence, and support the hypothesis that increased sensitivity to benzodiazepine inverse agonists is involved in the development of ethanol dependence.", 
    "82": "The imidazobenzodiazepinone Ro 15-4513 has been shown previously to bind to central benzodiazepine receptors as well as to a second, uncharacterized class of sites that do not bind diazepam, differentiating them from the normal benzodiazepine-binding site on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A (GABAA) receptor. This study describes the characterization of these unique diazepam-insensitive (DZ-IS) sites. Ro 15-4513 binding to DZ-IS sites was abundant in cerebellum from cow, rat and human and detectable in cortex, hippocampus and striatum by autoradiography on rat brain sections. These sites represented approximately 20% of the total binding in bovine cerebellar membranes, but only 2 to 3% of the total in cortex. Ro 15-4513 binds with the same affinity (Kd approximately 4.5 nM) to both diazepam-sensitive and DZ-IS sites in the cerebellum. A number of compounds which bind to the classical benzodiazepine receptors also bind to the DZ-IS sites. These compounds include: the pyrazoloquinoline CGS 8216, the beta-carbolines methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, ZK 95962, ZK 94326 and ZK 93126, as well as the classical benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788. Besides binding diazepam poorly, the DZ-IS sites demonstrate a very low affinity for other benzodiazepines. Ligands which bind to the various drug receptor sites on the GABA receptor complex do not directly modulate the binding of Ro 15-4513 to DZ-IS sites nor does ethanol. However, antagonism of Ro 15-4513 binding to the DZ-IS sites by methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and by CGS 8216 is modulated by the presence of GABA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "83": "We previously showed that M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors in dissociated cells of the adult rat cortex couple to phosphoinositide (Pl) and cyclic AMP (cAMP) metabolism, respectively. To further classify these receptors according to probable subtype, we have employed a group of selective muscarinic antagonists to obtain pharmacological profiles of the cortical M1 and M2 receptors, and to compare them with the muscarinic receptors in N1E-115 cells, which contain M1 receptors mediating cyclic GMP elevation and M4 receptors inhibiting cAMP levels. The M2-mediated inhibition of cAMP levels in cortex was blocked by 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) with higher potency (0.29 nM) than for reported potency in cardiac tissue (approximately 10 nM), indicating that this cortical response is probably not mediated by the m2 gene product. Similarly, the potency of hexahydrosiladiphenidol (HSD) at the cortical M2 receptor (159 nM) was somewhat greater than the reported potency in cardiac tissue (295 nM). The cardioselective drugs AF-DX 116 and methoctramine blocked the cortical M2 response less potently (135 nM and 229 nM, respectively) than would be expected for involvement of the m2 gene product. Thus, the potencies of AF-DX 116, methoctramine, 4-DAMP and HSD suggest that the cortical M2 response, like the striatal M2 receptor, is mediated by a noncardiac M2 receptor, perhaps by the m4 gene product. This postulate was supported by the significant correlations between cortical and striatal M2 receptors as compared to the M4 receptor in N1E-115 cells (r = 0.92 and 0.99, respectively, P less than .025).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "The effects of 12 beta-carboline derivatives on the binding of L-tryptophan and diazepam to bovine and human albumin have been investigated to seek similarities between the indole binding site on albumin and the benzodiazepine receptor in the brain. The binding of L-tryptophan and diazepam was measured at 37 degrees and pH 7.4 by equilibrium dialysis. Norharmane was the most potent inhibitor of the binding of L-tryptophan and diazepam to both bovine and human albumin. The kinetics of the inhibitory effects of several of the beta-carbolines were studied. Norharmane decreased the value (n) for the number of binding sites for the binding of L-tryptophan to both bovine and human albumin. Norharmane and harmane decreased the apparent association (Ka) but increased n for the interaction of diazepam with bovine albumin. Norharmane also had a similar effect on the binding of diazepam to human albumin. The similarities between the inhibitory effects of the beta-carbolines on the binding of L-tryptophan and diazepam to albumin and the affinity of the beta-carbolines for the central benzodiazepine receptor point to some common structural requirements for binding to the receptor and to albumin.", 
    "85": "Fifty fungi and two Streptomyces species were screened for their ability to metabolise the probe substrates aminopyrine, diazepam, testosterone, theophylline and warfarin. The metabolism of the 14C-labelled substrates by whole growing cells was compared with that by rat liver microsomes using TLC-autoradiography. Testosterone, warfarin and diazepam were readily metabolised by most microorganisms, and aminopyrine and theophylline were only metabolised by a few. A relationship between substrate lipophilicity and number of microorganisms able to biotransform the substrate was observed, lipophilic substrates being favoured for metabolism, analagous to mammalian cytochrome P-450. A wide variety of metabolites were produced by the screened cultures, with a significant number co-chromatographing with mammalian metabolites. Most microorganisms appeared to exhibit cytochrome P-450-type oxidative reactions such as hydroxylation and N-demethylation, similar to mammalian hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 systems.", 
    "86": "Caffeine and other methylxanthines elevate reinforcement threshold for electrical brain stimulation with an order of potency suggesting that the effect is mediated by antagonism of adenosine A2 receptors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate further the possible mechanism by which caffeine and other methylxanthines elevate reinforcement thresholds for ICSS. Drugs known to affect adenosinergic transmission in predictable ways, adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists and benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists, were tested to determine their effect upon reinforcement threshold. Both the selective A1 adenosine agonist, R(-)-PIA, and the non-selective A1/A2 adenosine agonist NECA failed to alter reinforcement thresholds, as did CGS 15943, a potent non-xanthine non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist. Chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine agonist, lowered reinforcement thresholds and FG 7142, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, elevated reinforcement thresholds, perhaps corresponding to their anxiolytic and anxiogenic subjective effects in humans. However, another benzodiazepine agonist, midazolam and another inverse agonist, beta-CCE, did not alter reinforcement thresholds. These results fail to support a general role for adenosinergic systems in the threshold-elevating effect of methylxanthines.", 
    "87": "The muscarinic cholinergic receptor of rat eccrine sweat gland was characterized using quantitative autoradiography and [3H]QNB as radioligand. The distribution of radioligand was maximal in the secretory coil. Autoradiographic competition binding studies were performed using selective antagonists to M1 (pirenzepine), M2 (AF-DX 116), and M3 (4-DAMP) and the classical nonselective antagonist atropine. pKi for pirenzepine, AF-DX 116, 4-DAMP, and atropine was 6.58, 5.47, 8.50, and 8.66 respectively indicating that the eccrine sweat gland muscarinic receptor was predominantly M3.", 
    "88": "We investigated the effects of propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCP) on learning and memory tasks in a passive avoidance test in mice to clarify whether beta-CCP is an agonist or antagonist at benzodiazepine (BZP) receptors. At doses up to 10 mg/kg i.v., beta-CCP had no effect on mice in the passive avoidance test. Diazepam impaired passive avoidance behavior and methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate(beta-CCM) enhanced it. beta-CCP blocked these effects of diazepam and beta-CCM in a dose-dependent manner similar to the effect of Ro15-1788. These effects of beta-CCP, which are thought to be mediated by BZP receptors, indicate that beta-CCP is an antagonist in the passive avoidance test.", 
    "89": "In this study, we examined the effects of the cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) antagonist devazepide (MK 329) and the CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 to reverse the decrease in the number of spontaneously active dopamine (DA) cells in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta after chronic haloperidol (HAL) or clozapine (CLOZ) treatment. The intravenous administration of devazepide (2 micrograms/kg) but not L-365,260 (2 micrograms/kg) reversed the reduction in the number of spontaneously active A9 and A10 DA cells produced by chronic HAL. Furthermore, devazepide also reversed the decrease in the number of spontaneously active A10 DA cells produced by chronic CLOZ administration. Overall, these results suggest that CCK-A but not CCK-B receptors play an important role in mediating or maintaining the chronic antipsychotic drug-induced effect on midbrain DA cells.", 
    "90": "Taurine, an inhibitory amino acid, potently acts on a subclass of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors. Taurine competitively inhibits [3H]muscimol binding to purified GABAA receptors with an average IC50 value of 50 microM, and enhances [3H]flunitrazepam binding to GABAA-linked benzodiazepine receptors with an EC50 of about 10 microM and with maximal extent lower than that for GABA. Taurine shows variable affinities (low micromolar to near millimolar) for muscimol binding sites in different brain regions as measured by autoradiography. The taurine-sensitive GABA sites are enriched in dentate gyrus, substantia nigra, cerebellum molecular layer, median thalamic nuclei, and hippocampal field CA3; these areas are also enriched in mRNA for the GABA-binding beta 2 subunit subtype. Taurine shows differential affinities for the multiple muscimol-GABA binding polypeptides present in purified GABAA receptors, notably a higher affinity for a beta 55 than a beta 58 polypeptide; these probably represent beta 2 and beta 3 clones, respectively. This work defines a significant target of taurine's inhibitory activity as some GABAA receptor GABA sites, lending support to the hypothesis that this endogenous substance may have a physiological action."
