    "0": "Second generation antipsychotics have less influence on prolactin levels than conventional antipsychotics (CA), which are commonly associated with sexual dysfunction and hyperprolactinaemia. However, only a few studies have been conducted assessing these newer antipsychotics and sexual function/dysfunction. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sexual function and hormonal profile of male schizophrenic patients taking olanzapine or CA. Sixty-three inpatients with acute episodes of schizophrenia were randomly assigned to take either olanzapine, or go on conventional antipsychotic treatment. The Dickson-Glazer sexual functioning questionnaire was used to assess sexual functioning where serum prolactin, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, total testosterone, free testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin concentrations were measured. All measurements were taken on discharge from the inpatient unit (baseline), and again at 3 and 9 months after discharge. Prolactin levels in the olanzapine group decreased more rapidly and were significantly lower than in the CA group after 3 months (12.1+/-6.3 microg/l, p=0.01; 18.1+/-11.2 microg/l, p=0.564, respectively). After nine months, there was a tendency toward normal levels in both groups, and the frequency of sexual complaints did not differ between the groups. This study showed no difference between olanzapine and conventional antipsychotics regarding sexual complaints in the treatment of schizophrenia, but did show a difference in the hormone level normalization rate.", 
    "1": "Medications are commonly prescribed to psychiatric inpatients on a PRN (pro re nata/as required) basis, allowing drugs to be administered on patient request or at nurses' discretion for psychiatric symptoms, treatment side effects or physical complaints. However, there has been no formal study of the pharmacokinetic implications of PRN prescribing. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of PRN drug prescription and administration, and to assess the potential for interactions involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 between drugs prescribed and administered to inpatients on psychiatry wards.A cross-sectional survey of prescriptions on general adult and functional elderly psychiatric wards in one city was carried out. Data were recorded from prescription charts of 323 inpatients (236 on general adult and 87 on functional elderly wards). Of 2089 prescriptions, 997 (48%) of prescriptions were on a PRN basis (most commonly benzodiazepines and other hypnotic agents, antipsychotics, analgesics and anticholinergic agents), but only 143 (14%) of these had been administered in the previous 24 hours. One fifth of patients were prescribed drug combinations interacting with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 of potential clinical importance which included one or more drugs prescribed on a PRN basis.PRN prescribing is common among inpatients in psychiatry, and may lead to cytochrome P450 mediated interactions. Prescribers should be aware of the potential for unpredictability in plasma concentrations, side effects and efficacy which PRN prescribing may cause through these interactions, particularly in old age psychiatry and in treatment of acute psychosis.", 
    "2": "The first-night effect is a well-known phenomenon that is considered to result from a subject's lack of adaptation to the unfamiliar environment of a sleep laboratory and to the technical equipment used for polysomnography. The effect has been explored as a laboratory model for transient insomnia. The main characteristics of this effect are short total sleep time (TST) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, a lower sleep efficiency index, and longer REM sleep latency. Previous studies have reported that personality traits (such as trait anxiety) are a potential cause of the first-night effect and that the placebo effect is closely related to the anxiety levels of the subjects. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports regarding the effects of a placebo on first-night sleep. This omission can be explained by the fact that the polysomnographic recordings obtained during the first night of a study are generally excluded from the analysis in order to avoid the inclusion of the first-night effect. In the present study, 8 male university students were subjected to polysomnographic examinations during drug-free, placebo-administration, and benzodiazepine-administration conditions in order to clarify the placebo effect on sleep during consecutive nights, particularly on the first night. The recordings for each condition were conducted for 4 consecutive nights. A placebo or 5 mg nitrazepam was administered at 2230 h using a double-blind crossover design, while no drug was administered during the drug-free condition. There was a 10-day interval between the examination of each condition. Polysomnographic recording was started at 2300 h and continued until the natural awakening of the subjects on the next morning. Subsequently, the subjects were requested to fill in a rating scale that is used to evaluate the subjective perception of sleep. An increase in stage-2 sleep associated with the first-night effect was observed on the first night during the drug-free and placebo-administration conditions. However, REM sleep reduction associated with the first-night effect was detected on the first night during the drug-free condition; this decrease in REM sleep was counteracted by the placebo during the placebo-administration condition. The nitrazepam, but not the placebo, decreased both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep. The values for the tendency to fall asleep, feeling refreshed upon awakening in the morning, and the tension upon awakening in the morning were improved to a greater extent by the placebo and nitrazepam administrations than when no drug was administered. These results demonstrate the possibility that placebo administration may have a hypnotic/anxiolytic effect and may improve transient insomnia without causing SWS and REM sleep reductions.", 
    "3": "The introduction of forward genetic screens in the mouse asks for techniques that make rapid screening of visual function possible. Transcranial imaging of intrinsic signal is suitable for this purpose and could detect the effects of retinal degeneration, and the increased predominance of the contralateral eye in albino animals. We quantified visual response properties of the cortex by introducing a normalization method to reduce the impact of biological noise. In addition, the presentation of a 'reset'-stimulus shortly after the probing stimulus at a different visual location could reduce the interstimulus time necessary for the decay of the response. Applying these novel methods, we found that acuity of C57Bl/6J mice rises from 0.35 cycles per degree (cpd) at postnatal day 25 to 0.56 cpd in adults. Temporal resolution was lower in adults than in juvenile animals. There was no patchy organization of spatial or temporal frequency preference at the intrinsic signal resolution. Monocular deprivation, a model for amblyopia and critical period plasticity, led to a loss in acuity and a shift towards the nondeprived eye in juvenile animals. Short deprivation did not lead to increased acuity of the nondeprived eye. In adults, a small ocular dominance shift was detectable with urethane anaesthesia. This was not observed when the combination of the opiate fentanyl, fluanisone with a benzodiazepine was used, adding evidence to the hypothesis that enhancing GABA(A)-receptor function masks an adult shift. Together, these novel applications confirm that noninvasive screening of many functional properties of the visual cortex is possible.",

    "5": "Sixty outpatients with chronic schizophrenia who had been treated with either amisulpride or olanzapine for at least six months were investigated.", 
    "6": "The scores of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms did not differ between the two groups, but patients treated with olanzapine had significantly lower scores on the excitement and depression/anxiety components of the PANSS. With regard to cognitive variables, patients treated with amisulpride showed significantly lower values regarding verbal fluency and significantly better verbal memory than patients treated with olanzapine. Both treatment groups were comparable with respect to functional and subjective outcome variables.", 
    "7": "These observations add to the evidence that continuous treatment with different second-generation antipsychotics with relatively few side effects leads to comparable outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "8": "Recent volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have suggested brain volume changes in schizophrenia to be progressive in nature. Whether this is a global process or some brain areas are more affected than others is not known. In a 5-year longitudinal study, MRI whole brain scans were obtained from 96 patients with schizophrenia and 113 matched healthy comparison subjects. Changes over time in focal gray and white matter were measured with voxel-based morphometry throughout the brain. Over the 5-year interval, excessive decreases in gray matter density were found in patients in the left superior frontal area (Brodmann areas 9/10), left superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 42), right caudate nucleus, and right thalamus as compared to healthy individuals. Excessive gray matter density decrease in the superior frontal gray matter was related to increased number of hospitalizations, whereas a higher cumulative dose of clozapine and olanzapine during the scan interval was related to lesser decreases in this area. In conclusion, gray matter density loss occurs across the course of the illness in schizophrenia, predominantly in left frontal and temporal cortices. Moreover, the progression in left frontal density loss appears to be related to an increased number of psychotic episodes, with atypical antipsychotic medication attenuating these changes.",

The psychomotor activity was measured by the Newman's test. Preoperative anxiety was treated with chlordemethyldiazepam (CHDDZ) per os, administered before induction of conscious sedation. In the first group, conscious sedation was accomplished by induction with titrated doses of i.v. diazepam, and in the second group with 0.1 mg/kg of intranasal midazolam. BIS values were analysed as Area Under the Curve (AUC).", 
    "11": "The AUC BIS values after CHDDZ presedation were overlapping in both groups. AUC after midazolam decreased after induction of the conscious sedation (P<0.05), during anesthesia (P<0.01) and during intervention (P<0.01) compared to the diazepam treatment. In the midazolam group the BIS values were on average lower than 90, while in the diazepam group they were on average higher than 95 (P<0.01). The psychomotor recovery was more impaired after midazolam.", 
    "12": "The study shows that nasal route ensures the quick absorption of midazolam as revealed during the first 3 min from drug administration. The depressant effect of midazolam increased as a function of time, reaching the highest levels during intervention. The results suggest that midazolam is endowed with sedative effects which may compromise the state of consciousness of the patient and be incompatible with the definition of conscious sedation in dentistry.",

All patients were evaluated for their levels of sedation by using BIS and the Ramsay scale simultaneously every 5 minutes with blind method. The total differences of median BIS in each sedation scale were compared. The BIS measurements and the corresponding Ramsay scale measurements were selected for analyzing the correlations. The sensitivity of BIS and Youden index were calculated, and the sensitivity and specificity of BIS were identified.", 
    "15": "The median BIS corresponding to each Ramsay scale decreased significantly along with the increasing of sedation depth. There were significant differences of median BIS in each Ramsay sedation scale (P<0.001). BIS was negatively correlated with Ramsay scale, and the r value was -0.794 (P<0.01). When the patient was optimally sedated (Ramsay scale 2-5 scores), the corresponding median BIS 95% confident interval (CI) were 61-84. The sensitivity and Youden index of BIS value with optimal or under sedation were the highest when BIS=81. The 95% CI of median BIS were 48-58 when Ramsay scale was 6 scores.",

The degree of coordination between spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiration frequency (RF), oxygen saturation of pulse (SpO(2)) were observed before the medication and at 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes following the administration of drugs in all the patients.", 
    "19": "Incoordination between spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation, fast RF, decreased SpO(2) were observed before the drug in all patients. Improvement of respiratory was significant in group 2. Patients in group 2 were in excellent coordination between spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation, reaching 100% within 30 minutes after administration, and lasting longer. The haemodynamics maintained stable and a significant improvement in respiration and SpO(2) were found. BP and HR were elevated significantly, and RF and hypoxemia were improved, and the degree of coordination between spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation reached 100% 5 minutes after the drug, but with shorter duration in group 1. There were no obvious changes in BP, HR, RF and hypoxemia, and the degree of coordination between spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation was lowest in group 3.",

Permeability to [3H]sucrose, [14C]phenytoin, and [14C]diazepam was measured in control and drug-resistant DIV-BBB with and without pretreatment with the MDR1 inhibitor XR9576. BBB integrity was monitored by transendothelial electrical resistance measurements (TEERs). Cell growth and viability were assessed by measurement of glucose consumption and lactate production.", 
    "23": "PSucrose and TEER values did not depend on the origin of the endothelium used (epileptic or normal). PPhenytoin was 10-fold less (1.54 x 10(-6) cm/s) in drug-resistant BBB models than in controls (1.74 x 10(-5) cm/s). MDR1 blockade with XR9576 was effective (3.5-fold increase) only in drug-resistant cultures. PDiazepam in control and drug-resistant DIV-BBB was not affected by XR9576 and did not depend on the epileptic or control origin of endothelia. The overall contribution of epileptic glia to pharmacoresistance was negligible.",

Early studies reported that that the development of physical dependence and tolerance to sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as the depressant and anticonvulsant effects evidenced with benzodiazepines, is not found with zolpidem. Direct to consumer advertising by the manufacturer continues to state that the risk for dependency is low; however, recent publications seem to contradict this. Additionally, adverse drug reactions affecting the central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system have been reported. Other studies have examined the interactions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and zolpidem as a possible cause of hallucinations. With continued physician marketing efforts touting the safety and efficacy of zolpidem, there is a high likelihood to overlook the risk of dependency and the symptoms related to zolpidem withdrawal. We report a case of a 41-year-old female who developed a dependency to zolpidem, who on her own decided to decrease her dosage, resulting in intractable nausea requiring hospitalization. Reported cases of zolpidem withdrawal have occurred with doses in excess of 160 mg per day, none of these have reported with intractable nausea as the sole symptom. In our reported case, although exceeding recommended dosage withdrawal phenomenon seemed to be severe after withdrawal from a comparatively low dose of zolpidem. Before zolpidem is prescribed, patient education should include warnings about the potential problems associated with dependency and abrupt discontinuation. Education about this common and likely underrecognized clinical phenomenon will help prevent future episodes and minimize the risk of misdiagnosis.",

    "54": "(1) When people who are physically dependent on alcohol stop drinking, they experience an alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms generally resolve spontaneously within a week, but more severe forms may be associated with generalised seizures, hallucinations and delirium tremens, which can be fatal. (2) We carried out a literature review in order to obtain answers to the following questions: how to predict or rapidly diagnose a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome; how to prevent and treat this syndrome; how to manage severe forms; and how to deal with the risk of vitamin B1 deficiency. (3) The main risk factors for severe withdrawal syndrome are: chronic heavy drinking; a history of generalised seizures; and a history of delirium tremens. (4) Anxiety, agitation, tremor, excessive sweating, altered consciousness and hallucinations are signs of a severe withdrawal syndrome. (5) Individual support and effective communication seem to reduce the risk of severe withdrawal syndrome. (6) Oral benzodiazepines are the best-assessed drugs for preventing a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly the risk of seizures. When given for a maximum of 7 days, the adverse effects are usually mild. (7) Clinical trials of other antiepileptics suggest they are less effective than benzodiazepines, and their addition to benzodiazepine therapy offers no tangible advantage. (8) Betablockers increase the risk of hallucinations, and clonidine increases the risk of nightmares, and the efficacy of these two drugs is not well documented. Neuroleptics increase the risk of seizures. There are no convincing data to support the use of magnesium sulphate or meprobamate (the latter carries a risk of serious adverse effects). Acamprosate, naltrexone and disulfiram are not beneficial in alcohol withdrawal. (9) Gradual withdrawal, i.e. ingestion of decreasing amounts of alcohol, has not been compared with other methods but is generally not recommended. (10) There are no specific recommendations on hydration. Note that excessive water-sodium intake carries a risk of pulmonary oedema in patients with heart disease. (11) As vitamin B1 deficiency is frequent and can lead to serious complications in alcohol-dependent patients, oral vitamin B1 supplementation is widely recommended, despite the absence of comparative trials. High doses must be used to compensate for poor absorption. Intravenous administration is best if patients have very poor nutritional status or severe complications such as Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (a medical emergency), even though rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported after vitamin B1 injection. (12) Planned alcohol withdrawal in specialised hospital units has been extensively studied. Outpatient withdrawal may be more appropriate for patients who are at low risk of developing severe withdrawal syndrome. (13) A large proportion of alcohol-dependent patients were excluded from trials of withdrawal strategies. These include elderly patients, patients with serious psychiatric or somatic disorders, and patients who are also dependent on other substances. (14) An oral benzodiazepine is the best-assessed treatment for a single episode of generalised seizures or hallucinations during alcohol withdrawal. (15) In randomised comparative trials benzodiazepines were more effective than neuroleptics in preventing delirium-related mortality. Currently, with appropriate fluid-electrolyte support, continuous monitoring of vital signs, and respiratory support if necessary, the mortality rate for delirium tremens is under 3%. (16) In practice, patients who are attempting to stop drinking alcohol need close personal support and communication, and a reassuring environment, as well as regular monitoring for early signs of a withdrawal syndrome; the latter may require benzodiazepine therapy.",

Among a total sample of 457 672 eligible patients, we included those aged >16 years, and whose diagnoses could be classified as mycosis. Itraconazole and fluconazole users were then selected. A potentially drug-drug interaction (DDI) occurred when the use of concomitant drugs were recorded within +/-30 days from the date of the first azoles prescription. Interacting drugs were classified according to the summary of product characteristics (SPC) as provided by the Italian Pharmaceutical Repertory (REFI).",

In all patients, possible encephalopathy was investigated according to the West Haven criteria. All those free of any sign of encephalopathy (West Haven 0) were also studied by the Trail Making Test forms A and B. The Child-Pugh score was determined in all patients, and results were compared with the West Haven stage.

In human liver microsomes, the mean 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) for PJ and GFJ versus CYP3A (triazolam alpha-hydroxylation) were 0.61% and 0.55%, (v/v) respectively, without preincubation of inhibitor with microsomes. After preincubation, the IC(50) for PJ increased to 0.97% (P < .05), whereas the IC(50) for GFJ decreased to 0.41% (P < .05), suggesting mechanism-based inhibition by GFJ but not PJ. Pretreatment of volunteer subjects (n = 13) with PJ (8 oz) did not alter the elimination half-life, volume of distribution, or clearance of intravenous midazolam (2 mg). Administration of PJ also did not affect C(max), total area under the curve (AUC), or clearance of oral midazolam (6 mg). However, GFJ (8 oz) increased midazolam C(max) and AUC by a factor of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively, and reduced oral clearance to 72% of control values. Thus, PJ does not alter clearance of intravenous or oral midazolam, whereas GFJ impairs clearance and elevates plasma levels of oral midazolam.",

    "80": "Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) remains an important problem in the developing world where environmental air pollution is increasing. Because the coincidence of these factors could increase the prevalence of asthma in these regions, airway reactivity to methacholine (MCh), capsaicin, and sulfur dioxide was studied in VAD rats. The impedance to a small volume oscillation was analyzed to determine airway resistance (R(aw)) and lung elastance (H). VAD rats demonstrated larger increases in R(aw) and H after the administration of methacholine, and in R(aw) after administration of capsaicin or sulfur dioxide. The muscarinic receptor-2 (M2R) selective antagonist AFDX-116 enhanced the effect of capsaicin in vitamin A sufficient (VAS) but not VAD rats and retinoic acid-administration partially restored this enhancement. These data indicate that diminished auto-inhibitory muscarinic receptor-2 function contributed to this increased airway responsiveness to pulmonary C-fiber stimulation in VAD rats. If children with VAD also have diminished M2R function, they may be more prone to develop asthma, particularly in the presence of environmental co-factors such as sulfur dioxide.",

In the Vogel conflict drinking test in rats, SB-399885 (1-3mg/kg i.p.) caused an anxiolytic-like activity comparable to that of diazepam (2.5-5mg/kg i.p.). An anxiolytic-like effect was also seen in the elevated plus-maze test in rats, where SB-399885 (0.3-3mg/kg i.p.) was slightly weaker than diazepam (2.5-5mg/kg i.p.). In the four-plate test in mice, SB-399885 (3-20mg/kg i.p.) showed an anxiolytic-like effect which was weaker than that produced by diazepam (2.5-5mg/kg i.p.). In the forced swim test in rats, SB-399885 (10mg/kg i.p.) significantly shortened the immobility time and the effect was stronger than that of imipramine (30mg/kg i.p.). In the forced swim test in mice, SB-399885 (20-30mg/kg i.p.) had an anti-immobility action, comparable to imipramine (30mg/kg i.p.) and also in the tail suspension test in mice, SB-399885 (10-30mg/kg i.p.) had an antidepressant-like effect, though was weaker than imipramine (10-20mg/kg i.p.). The tested 5-HT(6) antagonist (3-20mg/kg i.p.) shortened the walking time of rats in the open field test and, at a dose of 30mg/kg i.p. reduced the locomotor activity of mice. SB-399885 (in doses up to 30mg/kg i.p.) did not affect motor coordination in mice and rats tested in the rota-rod test. Such data indicate that the selective 5-HT(6) receptor antagonist SB-399885had specific effects, indicative of this compound's anxiolytic and antidepressant potential.", 
    "82": "Patients with malignant pleural effusion, recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, and recurrent benign pleural effusions may have significant relief of their symptoms with chemical pleurodesis. Talc is the most frequently used chemical sclerosant; however, it has been known to induce Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Other agents such as doxycycline and erythromycin have documented efficacy as sclerosing agents in the pleura, but they are not in widespread clinical use and have significant documented adverse reactions. Diazepam may represent a potential sclerosing agent in the pleura, because of its local inflammatory profile in other tissues.", 
    "83": "Overall, 33 adult New Zealand White rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were randomized to 5 treatment groups. Each group received an intrapleural injection via 5 Fr silastic tubes of one of the following agents: 35-mg/kg erythromycin in 2 ml of saline, 70-mg/kg talc in 2 ml of saline, 10-mg/kg doxycycline in 2 ml of saline, 0.4-mg/kg diazepam in 2 ml of saline, or 2 ml of saline as a control. The animals were euthanized and necropsied 30 days after injection. The pleural surfaces were assessed for macroscopic and microscopic evidence of surrounding inflammation and fibrosis.", 
    "84": "Doxycycline resulted in severe pleural inflammation and fibrosis with pulmonary hemorrhage, whereas talc-treated animals had less effective fibrosis and granulomas. A trend toward higher mortality occurred in doxycycline-treated animals. Erythromycin demonstrated similar fibrosis (p=0.487) to doxycycline and had less inflammation (p<0.001). Diazepam treatment had little effect in the pleural cavity.", 
    "85": "This study demonstrates that erythromycin may be the ideal sclerosing agent. It had the advantage of maximal fibrosis with minimal inflammation. Although doxycycline was the most potent pleural sclerosant, it caused severe local tissue damage. Talc treatment resulted in only mild fibrosis, and diazepam was ineffective.", 
    "86": "To determine whether a benzodiazepine facilitates systematic desensitization, 144 subjects with dental injection phobia received systematic desensitization in combination with placebo or one of two doses of alprazolam (0.5mg or 0.75mg). Systematic desensitization therapy included computer-controlled presentation of digitized video segments followed by in vivo exposure segments, culminating in an actual dental injection. Subjects advanced to the next hierarchy segment when low anxiety was reported during a segment. Alprazolam and placebo groups progressed at the same rate. The 0.75mg group had elevated heart rates while watching video segments compared with placebo. In a subsequent behavioral avoidance test (during which subjects were randomized to a new drug condition), there was no indication that state-dependent learning had occurred. Dental fear was reduced similarly in all groups for 1 year after study completion. No advantage was found to combining alprazolam with systematic desensitization for dental injection phobia.", 
    "87": "Drug-induced myocardial infarction is not a common phenomenon and the underlying mechanism has been related with the coronary artery spasm in the majority of cases. It is mainly related to illicit substances such as cocaine, ecstasy, LSD and amphetamine. According to the findings in the literature, it is most likely that myocardial ischemia due to amphetamine abuse is a result of combined mechanisms which include coronary artery vasospasm, and in lesser extent thrombus formation or direct myocardial toxicity. Diazepam is also usually found as a substance of abuse. Recent findings indicate that diazepam exerts an inhibitory activity on different isoforms of the enzyme cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which can be found in the heart muscle and also show that diazepam potentate the positive inotropic effect of both noradrenaline and adrenaline, which subsequently leads to increase in myocardial contractility. We propose that dual intoxication with amphetamine and benzodiazepine potentate their effects on cardiac tissue and coronary arteries which results in larger myocardial injury.", 
    "88": "The insect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) is evaluated as a potential target for insecticide action. The mammalian M2/M4-selective antagonist radioligand [3H]AF-DX 384 (a pirenzepine analogue) binds to Drosophila mAChR at a single high-affinity site identical to that for the nonselective antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and with a pharmacological profile distinct from that of all mammalian mAChR subtypes. Three nonselective antagonists (QNB, scopolamine, and atropine) show the highest affinity (Ki=0.5-2.4 nM) at the Drosophila target, and AF-DX 384 and M3-selective 4-DAMP (dimethyl-4-(diphenylacetoxy)piperidinium iodide) rank next in potency (Ki=5-18 nM). Eleven muscarinic antagonists generally exhibit higher affinity than eight agonists. On injection into houseflies, the antagonists 4-DAMP and (S)-(+)-dimethindene produce suppressed movement, the agonist (methyloxadiazolyl)quinuclidine causes knockdown and tremors, and all of them inhibit [3H]QNB binding ex vivo, indicating possible mAChR-mediated intoxication. The insect mAChR warrants continuing study in lead generation to discover novel insecticides.", 
    "89": "This retrospective study aims to report on the use of dexmedetomidine to treat opioid withdrawal following sedation during mechanical ventilation in a cohort of infants. Seven infants in the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care center, ranging in age from three to 24 months (12.4 +/- 8.2 months) and in weight from 4.6 to 15.4 kgs (9.9 +/- 4.2 kgs), had received a continuous fentanyl infusion, supplemented with intermittent doses of midazolam for sedation, during mechanical ventilation. Withdrawal was documented by a Finnegan score > or = 12. Dexmedetomidine was administered as a loading dose of 0.5 microg/kg/hr, followed by an infusion of 0. 5 microg/kg/hr. Dexmedetomidine effectively controlled the signs and symptoms of withdrawal in the seven patients. Subsequent Finnegan scores were < or = 7 at all times (median 4, range 1 to 7). Two patients required a repeat of the loading dose and an increase of the infusion to 0.7 microg/kg/hr. These two patients had received higher doses of fentanyl than the other five patients (8.5 +/- 0.7 versus 4.6 +/- 0.5 microg/kg/hr, p < 0.0005). No adverse hemodynamic or respiratory effects related to dexmedetomidine were noted. This report involves the largest cohort of patients to receive dexmedetomidine in the treatment of withdrawal following opioid and benzodiazepine sedation during mechanical ventilation. We conclude that dexmedetomidine offers a viable option for such issues in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) setting.", 
    "90": "The purpose of this audit was to find out the efficiency of our system in providing premedication to surgical day care patients. This audit was conducted in the Surgical Day Care (SDC) Unit of a University Hospital. All patients anaesthetised in the SDC unit on day care basis were included in this audit. Nursing notes and preoperative orders of all patients to be anaesthetised were checked to see whether premedication was given or not and was the timing according to the orders written. The result showed that out of 205 patients scheduled, twenty (9.7%) patients did not receive premedication. Only 37.2% of our patients were receiving premedication according to the orders. The majority of the errors noted in our audit were system errors related to cancellation, rescheduling and admitting the outpatient in the inpatient ward.", 
    "91": "We investigated the analgesic effect of intra-operative intravenous diclofenac in a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled paralled group study after adenoidectomy in 150 children aged 1-7 years. A standard anaesthetic method was used and all children received oral diazepam as premedication. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and maintained with halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen with controlled ventilation. Children in the diclofenac group received 1 mg/kg i.v. after induction of anaesthesia followed by an infusion of diclofenac 1 mg/kg over 2 hours. Children in the placebo group received 0.9% saline. At the end of procedure the children were transferred to the recovery room for continuous monitoring of vital signs and assessment of pain. Standard deviation, means, ranges and students' t-test statistics were used for data analysis. Worst pain observed in the recovery room was lower in the diclofenac group both at rest and during swallowing. It was therefore concluded that intravenous diclofenac given intra-operatively has analgesic effect in the immediate post-operative period and it is recommended for small children during adenoidectomy.", 
    "92": "Prescription opioids are used medically to treat pain, but their diversion and abuse continues to escalate in the United States. Abuse of OxyContin (Purdue Pharma LP, Stamford, CT), a timed-release form of oxycodone, is a major focus of public health and law enforcement agencies. The rise in opioid abuse may lead to an increase in opioid dependence in pregnancy, which was a focus of this study. Our retrospective chart review examined the demographics and patterns of opioid addiction of pregnant women admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit in an academic medical center in central Kentucky. Charts of 94 women admitted from January 2001 to May 2004 were reviewed. Information obtained included demographics and details of their opioid use, including the specific opioid(s) used, route of administration, and duration of use. Treatment information included length of hospital stay, stabilizing dose of methadone, comorbid drug use, and concomitant Axis I diagnoses. Most women were in their mid-twenties and in the second trimester of pregnancy when they sought treatment. Benzodiazepines were the most common comorbid drugs of abuse and the most frequent medical complication of their drug use was hepatitis C, newly diagnosed in 11 patients. This study demonstrates the need for further research in prescription opioid dependency in pregnancy, methadone maintenance therapy, the safety of detoxification, and neonatal outcomes.", 
    "93": "Drug-induced delirium is a common matter in the elderly and anticholinergics, together with a number of different drugs, may significantly contribute to the delirium onset, especially in demented people. We report a case of a probable anticholinergic drug-induced delirium in an elderly patient. An 80-year-old man with Alzheimer's dementia presented with wandering, depressed mood with crying, somatic worries, anedonism and suicide recurrent ideas. A first external psychiatric assessment led to the diagnosis of melancholic depression and therapy with haloperidol 2mg/day, orphenadrine 100mg daily, amitriptyline 40 mg/day, lorazepam 2mg/day was started. Two weeks later patient suddenly developed delirium, characterized by nocturnal agitation, severe insomnia, daytime sedation, confusion, hallucinations and persecutory delusions. These symptoms progressively worsened, with the consequent caregiver's stress. A geriatric consultation excluded the main causes of delirium, therefore both Operative Units of Pharmacovigilance and Psychiatry were activated, for a clinical pharmacological and psychiatric assessment. Haloperidol, amitriptyline and orphenadrine were promptly dismissed. The patient began a treatment with quetiapine 25mg/day for two days, then twice a day, and infusion of saline 1000 ml/day for two days; psychiatric symptoms gradually diminished and therapy with galantamine was begun. We postulate that this clinical report is suggestive for an anticholinergic drug- induced delirium since the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between delirium and drug therapy. In conclusion, a complete geriatric, pharmacological, and psychiatric evaluation might be necessary in order to reduce the adverse drug reactions in older patients treated with many drugs.", 
    "94": "Good sleep is an important index of the quality of life in people and above all in old subjects. Among all the symptoms reported to general practitioner, insomnia is at the 3(rd) place and this is present in particular in the elderly. In elderly people high comorbidity and polytreatment are often present. We have studied 60 elderly people with history of insomnia and concomitant diseases: depression, dementia and behavioral disturbances. All the patients of the present study were visited in our outpatients' department. Three hypnotic drugs were used for the treatment of insomnia: zolpidem, or triazolam, or oxazepam, respectively at doses of 10mg/day, 0.125-0.25mg/day and 15.0mg/day. All the three drugs showed to be effective and safe; no paradoxical effects were observed.", 
    "95": "The use of atypical antipsychotics (AA) is suggested in the treatment of BPSD, although controversial data are available on their safety and efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of AA and whether this therapy could modify cognitive and functional domains in parallel with BPSD modifications. Out of 1,100 patients followed by the psychogeriatric ambulatory of our hospital, 69 patients (6.2%) were in therapy with AA and only 32 of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria of this study. Namely, the availability was required of a complete geriatric assessment, including the evaluation of cognitive (mini mental state examination=MMSE), emotional (the Italian \"scala di valutazione del benessere emotivo nell'anziano\"=SVEBA), functional (basic and instrumental activities of daily living=ADL and IADL), as well as behavioral (neuropsychological inventory=NPI) status, at the beginning (T(0)) and after a 6 month therapy (T(1)). The AA prescribed were risperidone (42.8%), olanzapine (31.3%), quetiapine (25.9%). The mean age was 80.1 years; 34.4% male; 65.6% female. Educational level was elementary in 90.6% of cases. Only 21.9% were institutionalized. 15.6% had 1 cardiovascular risk factor (CVRF), 50% more than 1, and the remaining with no CVRF. More than the half of them were diagnosed with degenerative dementia (D) (40.6% Alzheimer D=AD; 15.6% fronto-temporal dementia (FTD); 34.4% with vascular dementia (VD) (9.4%) or combined D (25%); 3,1 % with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), classified as F06.7 by the ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases) and 6.2% with psychiatric disturbances. The most common BPSD were hallucinations, delusions, agitation, verbal and physical aggression. A paired t-test was applied to analyze data. There was a significant improvement with all 3 AA on NPI (mean NPI T(0)=27.50 vs. T(1)=12.13; t=7.49). An improvement was also observed on SVEBA (t=1.97), close to significance. Most people did not have any adverse effects; 5 patients (15.6%) had extrapyramidal symptoms and 1 (3.1%) showed ginecomasty, clinically so relevant to cause the interruption of the treatment. The profile of safety and efficacy described on the whole sample was confirmed when it was subdivided according to kind of drug, illness severity and presence/absence of CVRF. In a large sample of the \"real\" subjects attending a geriatric service for dementia, the accurate selection of patients treatable with AA leads to identification of a population with a negligible rate of adverse effects in presence of a high rate of efficacy with respect not only to BPSD but also to cognitive and functional domains.", 
    "96": "A 23-member C2-aryl pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-5,11-dione (PBD dilactam) library has been synthesized using Suzuki coupling, and the effect of base upon racemisation at the C11a-position during the cross-coupling reaction studied. Three library members (21, 30 and 33) were sufficiently cytotoxic in the NCI's preliminary screen to warrant further evaluation, and one (30, R=p-Br) was found to be cytotoxic at the sub-micromolar level in the A498 renal cancer cell line. DNA thermal denaturation studies suggested that this activity may be associated with non-covalent DNA interaction, and also demonstrated that introduction of C2-C3 unsaturation and addition of C2-aryl functionalities to the PBD dilactam skeleton significantly enhanced helix stabilisation compared to the unsubstituted PBD dilactam (6).",

    "98": "This study presents a new robust method of developing quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models based on fuzzy mappings. An important issue in QSAR modelling is of robustness, i.e., model should not undergo overtraining and model performance should be least sensitive to the modelling errors associated with the chosen descriptors and structure of the model. We establish robust input-output mappings for QSAR studies based on fuzzy \"if-then\" rules. The identification of these mappings (i.e. the construction of fuzzy rules) is based on a robust criterion that the maximum possible value of energy-gain from modelling errors to the identification errors is minimum. The robustness of proposed approach has been illustrated with simulation studies and QSAR modelling examples. The method of robust fuzzy mappings has been compared with Bayesian regularized neural networks through the QSAR modelling examples of (1) carboquinones' data set, (2) benzodiazepine data set, and (3) predicting the rate constant for hydroxyl radical tropospheric degradation of 460 heterogeneous organic compounds.", 
    "99": "The present study was conducted to characterize the binding of neurotransmitter receptors (dopamine D(2), serotonin 5-HT(2), histamine H(1), adrenaline alpha(1) and muscarine M(l) receptors) in the rat's brain after the oral administration of haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine. Haloperidol at 1 and 3 mg/kg displayed significant activity to bind the D(2) receptor (increase in the Kd value for [(3)H]raclopride binding) in the corpus striatum with little change in the activity toward the 5-HT(2) receptor (binding parameters for [(3)H]ketanserin). In contrast, risperidone (0.1-3 mg/kg) showed roughly 30 times more affinity for the 5-HT(2) receptor than D(2) receptor. Also, olanzapine (1-10 mg/kg) was most active toward the H(1) receptor in the cerebral cortex, corpus striatum, and hippocampus, was less active in binding 5-HT(2) and D(2) receptors, and showed the least affinity for alpha(1) and M(1) receptors. In conclusion, haloperidol and risperidone administered orally selectively bind D(2) and 5-HT(2) receptors, respectively, in the rat brain, while olanzapine binds H(1), 5-HT(2), and D(2) receptors more than alpha(1) and M(1) receptors.",

We detected a large population (Bmax=8.25+/-1.1 pmol x mg protein(-1)) of high affinity (Kd=33.6+/-1.5 nM) binding sites for flunitrazepam. These sites harboured a singular pharmacological modulation that does not fit well with a mammalian central benzodiazepine receptor, mainly due to a very high affinity for Ro5-4864 and a very low affinity for clonazepam. We also detected a second population of benzodiazepine binding sites labelled with high affinity (IC50=85 nM) by [3H]-PK11195, a selective ligand of the mammalian peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. In conclusion, this work describes the pharmacological properties of a large population of central-like benzodiazepine receptors supporting their study as putative new targets for the development of anti-parasitic agents. We also describe, for the first time, the presence of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in this parasite.",

The cats showed similar changes in ionized magnesium and ionized calcium, and also had a significant increase in serum total magnesium (2.17 +/- 0.20 to 2.31 +/- 0.25 mg dL(-1), p = 0.009) CONCLUSIONS, CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A post-operative decrease in ionized calcium was demonstrated in healthy animals, as well as an increase in ionized or total magnesium after various anesthetic protocols and surgeries. These changes, while statistically significant, do not appear to be clinically significant, as values remained within reference ranges at all times.", 
    "105": "Midazolam is a commonly used sedative in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care unit (ICU) settings worldwide. We used a nine-step decision-making algorithm to determine whether therapeutic monitoring of midazolam in the ICU is warranted. Midazolam has a higher clearance and shorter half-life than other benzodiazepines, and prolonged sedation is achieved with continuous infusion. There appears to be very good correlation between plasma concentrations of both midazolam and its active metabolite, alpha1-hydroxymidazolam, and the degree of sedation. However, due to high interpatient variability, it is not possible to predict the level of sedation in any given individual based on plasma concentration of midazolam or its metabolites. Moreover, no simple and practical assay is available to quantitate midazolam plasma concentrations in the acute ICU setting. Many scales are available to assess the sedative effects of midazolam. Because the plasma concentration of midazolam required to achieve a constant level of sedation is highly variable, it is usually more prudent for the clinician to monitor for sedation with a validated clinical scale than by plasma concentrations alone. Various physiologic parameters, including age-related effects, compromised renal function, and liver dysfunction affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Although routine drug monitoring for all critically ill patients receiving midazolam is not recommended, this practice is likely beneficial in patients with neurologic damage in whom sedation cannot be assessed and in patients who have renal failure with a prolonged time to awakening.",

The state of casualties might prevent getting access to their veins. The bone injection gun (BIG) was established as a simple method for introducing an intraosseous (i.o.) line and could be applied while wearing a protective suit. The present study followed the pharmacokinetics of the anticonvulsive drug midazolam after i.o. administration in pigs compared with i.v. and the common intramuscular (i.m.) administration. A new method for monitoring midazolam concentrations in plasma was developed. Plasma concentrations following both i.v. and i.o. administrations peaked at 2 min post injection and only at 10 min following the i.m. route. In an antidotal treatment study against paraoxone poisoning, the anticonvulsive effect of midazolam appeared immediately following i.o. administration, while it took 5-10 min to exhibit a similar effect following i.m. administration. This study indicates that the use of i.o. administration after OP poisoning might provide the necessary fast response for rapid termination of convulsions. The BIG might offer a convenient method for treating casualties in the chemical arena by teams wearing full protective gear.",

This preliminary study monitored the changes in leptin levels for 2 weeks after olanzapine treatment had been initiated. The relationship between the changes in circulating leptin levels and alterations in body weight in 9 patients with schizophrenia who received olanzapine was examined. The results showed that olanzapine may cause a surge in circulating leptin levels before weight gain is manifested. Moreover, higher pretreatment circulating leptin levels predicted lower weight gains after olanzapine treatments (r = -0.93; p < 0.05) after controlling for the effect of sex.",

Fourteen yearling harp seal pups were anesthetized three times each as part of a prospective, cross-over, blinded study. Each animal received i.m. premedication with saline, low-dose, or high-dose midazolam (respectively 0.1 and 0.2 mg/ kg). Following premedication, anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in oxygen delivered through a mask and connected to a Bain non-rebreathing system. A significantly longer time was taken from the end of general anesthesia to head movement in the high-dose group compared with the saline group (P = 0.002). A significantly longer time was taken from the end of general anesthesia to ambulation in the high-dose group compared with the saline group (P = 0.006).

All partridges recovered from sedation without any disturbance. Xylazine and diazepam administration did not induce significant changes in heart rate, which did decrease significantly after medetomidine and detomidine administration (P < 0.001). Mean respiratory rate was decreased dramatically at 20 and 30 min after xylazine (P < 0.001) and medetomidine (P < 0.005) administration, and at all stages of sedation after detomidine injection (P < 0.001), whereas there was not any significant change after diazepam injection. In all groups, cloacal temperature measured at 10, 20, and 30 min tended to decrease compared with baseline values. Sedative effects of the drugs started within 2.1+/-0.2 min for detomidine, 2.6 +/- 0.4 min for diazepam, 3.1 -+/-.4 min for xylazine, and 4.8+/-0.8 min for medetomidine application. There was an extreme variability in time to recovery for each drug: 205 +/-22.2 min for xylazine, 95 -12.2 min for medetomidine, 260+/-17.6 min for detomidine, and 149 + 8.3 min for diazepam. In conclusion, xylazine, medetomidine, detomidine, and diazepam produced sedation, which could permit some clinical procedures such as handling and radiographic examination of partridges to occur. Of the four drugs, xylazine produced stronger and more efficient sedation compared to the others, which could permit only minor procedures to be performed. However, depending on the drug used, monitoring of heart and respiratory rates and cloacal temperature might be required.",

    "129": "Fibromyalgia is a significant clinical problem associated with generalized pain and significant interference with daily activities. Although a variety of treatment modalities have been utilized, clinicians have struggled to find an effective means of treatment. Therefore, this study assessed the efficacy of the atypical neuroleptic olanzapine for the treatment of fibromyalgia symptoms. To examine the efficacy of olanzapine for the treatment of fibromyalgia symptoms, the charts of 51 patients treated with olanzapine were evaluated for improvements in pain and daily life functioning. At the time of initial assessment, patients had been diagnosed with a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders and a history of neuroleptic treatment. Pain was widespread and characteristic of pain associated with fibromyalgia. Pretreatment ratings on pain and the interference scales averaged 6.54-8.69 on a 0-10 scale. Post-treatment ratings on the same scales revealed significant improvement on virtually all scales. The benefits of olanzapine to improve fibromyalgia symptoms must, however, be carefully considered because there were a variety of side effects (i.e., weight gain, somnolence/sedation) that were of sufficient strength to cause a number of patients to discontinue treatment. In general, the data provide strong support that olanzapine can, in certain patients, improve symptoms associated with fibromyalgia in patients who have had limited success with other treatment modalities.", 
    "130": "Ivermectin is one of the most commonly used drugs in pharmacotherapy of parasitic diseases in domestic and wild animals caused by parasitic nematodes and arthropods. However, ivermectin and other avermectins very often produce side-effects in hosts. The most dominant clinical symptom of ivermectin toxicity in domestic and wild animals is CNS depression. In nematodes, the target site of ivermectin's action is glutamate-gated chloride-channel receptor and GABA receptor. The depressive effect of ivermectin in mammals might include more than one mechanism; therefore, the anticonvulsive effect of ivermectin against convulsions caused by lidocaine and strychnine was evaluated. Ivermectin antagonized lidocaine- and strychnine-induced convulsions in rats, although these have different mechanisms. In the present study, the anticonvulsive ED50 ofivermectin for lidocaine-induced convulsions was 2.44 mg/kg (95% CL 1.67 to 3.57 mg/kg), whereas for convulsions induced by strychnine it was higher at 4.25 mg/kg (95% CL 2.32 to 3.78 mg/kg). At the same time, both anticonvulsive doses are significantly lower then the observed LD50 of ivermectin (18.20 mg/kg). Furthermore, flumazenil (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg), an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors, antagonizes just one part of these anticonvulsive effects of ivermectin. Our results show the significant anticonvulsive properties of ivermectin and support the findings that ivermectin in the CNS of mammals produces multiple inhibitory effects, probably through participation in the function of GABA-sensitive and GABA-insensitive chloride channels.",

Insomnia and hypersomnia are frequent sleep disorders, and these are most often treated pharmacologically with hypnotics and wake-promoting compounds. These compounds act on classical neurotransmitter systems, such as benzodiazepines on gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors, and amphetamine-like stimulants on monoaminergic terminals to modulate neurotransmission. In addition, acetylcholine, amino acids, lipids and proteins (cytokines) and peptides, are known to significantly modulate sleep, and thus, are possibly involved in the pathophysiology of some sleep disorders. Due to recent developments in molecular biological techniques, many neuropeptides have been newly identified, and some are found to significantly modulate sleep. Recent discoveries also include the finding that the impairment of hypocretin/orexin neurotransmission (a recently isolated hypothalamic neuropeptide and receptor system), is the major pathophysiology of narcolepsy with cataplexy. A hypocretin replacement therapy is anticipated to reverse the disease symptoms in humans.

The subjects whose plasma concentrations of paroxetine were less than 20 ng/mL had a significantly higher mean reduction ratio in PAS score than the subjects whose plasma concentrations of paroxetine were >20 ng/mL. Multiple regression analysis showed that the plasma concentration of paroxetine was the only significant factor and accounted for 28.0% of the variability in the reduction ratio of PAS score of the subjects. The final model of correlation was: reduction ratio in PAS score = 0.423 - 0.009 x (plasma concentrations of paroxetine) (R = 0.529, P = 0.014, coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.280). Assuming that the reduction ratio in PAS score was 0.2 in the equation above, plasma concentration of paroxetine is calculated to be about 25 ng/mL, which is suggested to be the upper end of the therapeutic window for the initial phase of the treatment with paroxetine for panic disorder.", 
    "154": "2-{Butyryl-[2'-(4,5-dimethyl-isoxazol-3-ylsulfamoyl)-biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-amino}-N-isopropyl-3-methyl-butyramide (BMS-1) is a potent dual acting angiotensin-1 and endothelin-A receptor antagonist. The compound was subject to rapid metabolic clearance in monkey and human liver microsomes and exhibited low systemic exposure and marked interanimal variability in cynomolgus monkeys after p.o. administration. The variability pattern was identical to that of midazolam given p.o. in the same monkeys, as measured by area under the curve and Cmax values, suggesting that CYP3A-mediated metabolism might play a role in the rapid clearance and observed interanimal variability. Subsequent in vitro metabolism studies using human liver microsomes and cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes revealed that BMS-1 was a CYP3A4 substrate and was not metabolized by other human P450 enzymes. Mass spectral and NMR analyses of key metabolites led to the identification of the dimethyl isoxazole group as a major metabolic soft spot for BMS-1. Replacement of the 4-methyl group on the isoxazole ring with halogens not only improved overall metabolic stability but also decreased CYP3A-mediated hydroxylation of the isoxazole 5-methyl group. As exemplified by 2-{butyryl-[2'-(4-fluoro-5-methyl-isoxazol-3-ylsulfamoyl)-biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-amino}-N-isopropyl-3-methyl-butyramide (BMS-3), a fluorinated analog of BMS-1, the structural modification resulted in an increase in the systemic exposure relative to previous analogs and a dramatic reduction in interanimal variability in the monkeys after p.o. administration. In addition, BMS-3 could be metabolized by both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, thus avoiding the reliance on a single P450 enzyme for metabolic clearance. Integration of results obtained from in vitro metabolism studies and in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluations enabled the modulation of site-specific CYP3A-mediated metabolism, yielding analogs with improved overall metabolic profiles.", 
    "155": "Perception of quality of life (QOL) may differ depending on the perspective. This 12-month, prospective, naturalistic study compared QOL ratings in outpatients on antipsychotic treatment for schizophrenia both from a \"subjective\" patient rated and an \"objective\" physician rated perspective. Included were 1462 patients. Two scales were used to assess patient and physician perspectives: the Subjective Well-being on Neuroleptics (SWN) scale and the Quality of Life Scale (QLS). Linear correlation was found between both ratings: 10 points on the SWN corresponded to 9.35 points on the QLS. Spearman's correlation coefficients increased over time up to r=0.71 at Month 12. Patients were grouped into four cohorts depending on the degree of concordance between SWN and QLS ratings. Several factors affecting the concordance of both ratings were identified. Compared to the cohort with QLS=SWN, higher QOL ratings by the physician (QLS>SWN) were more likely in females than in males (OR=1.36; 95% CI 1.00 - 1.85) and in older than in younger patients (<or=30 years vs. >50 years: OR=0.58, 95% CI 0.34 - 0.998), but less likely in patients with high baseline CGI-severity (CGI >4; OR=0.63; 95% CI 0.47 - 0.86) or treatment with oral typicals before baseline (OR=0.53; 95% CI 0.31 - 0.91). Higher QOL ratings by the patient (SWN>QLS) were less likely in patients with psychotherapy before baseline (OR=0.54; 95% CI 0.36 - 0.81), medication intolerability before baseline (OR=0.53; 95% CI 0.36 - 0.78) or patient request of treatment change at baseline (OR=0.64; 95% CI 0.42 - 0.96). The combination of several factors predicted concordant ratings, including male sex, young age, high CGI at baseline, and psychotherapy prior to the study.",

These 1,2,4-oxadiazoles exhibit considerable activity in both pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and maximal electroshock seizure (MES) models. Compound 10 was protective in the PTZ model in rats with an oral ED(50) of 25.5mg/kg and in the MES model in rats with an oral ED(50) of 14.6mg/kg. Neurotoxicity (rotarod) was observed with an ED(50) of 335mg/kg. We found several oxadiazoles that acted as selective GABA potentiating compounds with no interaction to the benzodiazepine binding site.", 
    "157": "Imaging of microglia cells using the radiolabeled ligand toward peripheral benzodiazepine receptor(PBR) is applied to brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. A novel PBR radioligand other than [11C] PK11195 might be desirable to detailedly delineate this complicated phenomenon and a novel idea other than in vitro PBR binding ability is desirable to expect feasibility of a new candidate. Current status, problems and future prospects associated with indirect imaging of microglial activity with [11C] PK11195 will be discussed.", 
    "158": "Spontaneous electromagnetic brain rhythms have been widely used in human neuropharmacology, but their applicability is complicated by the difficulties to localize their origins in the human cortex. Here, we used a novel multi-modal non-invasive imaging approach to localize lorazepam (30 microg/kg i.v.) modulation of cortical generators of spontaneous brain rhythms. Eight healthy subjects were measured with 306-channel magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled (saline), crossover design. For anatomically realistic source modeling, wavelet-transformed MEG data were combined with high-resolution MRI to constrain the current locations to the cortical mantle, after which individual data were co-registered to surface-based coordinate system for the calculation of group statistical parametric maps of drug effects. The distributed MRI-constrained MEG source estimates demonstrated decreased alpha (10 Hz) activity in and around the parieto-occipital sulcus and in the calcarine sulcus of the occipital lobe, following from increased GABA(A)-inhibition by lorazepam. Anatomically constrained spectral imaging displays the cortical loci of drug effects on oscillatory brain activity, providing a novel tool for human pharmacological neuroimaging.", 
    "159": "The aim of the present investigation was to assess neuroprotection exerted by diazepam (0.1-25 microM) in rat cortical brain slices subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation. Neuronal injury and neuroprotection were assessed by measuring the release of glutamate and lactate dehydrogenase and tissue water content. Results demonstrate that diazepam exerted neuroprotective effects according to a \"U-shaped\", hormetic-like, concentration-response curve, with an efficacy window of 0.5-5 microM concentration. Flumazenil (20 microM) fully antagonised neuroprotection afforded by 5 microM diazepam. In conclusion, the hormetic response of diazepam should be taken into consideration when designing experiments aimed at assessing diazepam neuroprotection against ischemia/reoxygenation injury.",

    "163": "Disruption in the allocation of covert attention might contribute to patients' decline in spatial working memory after antipsychotic treatment. Alterations in prefrontal dopaminergic systems or reduced thalamocortical drive might account for this apparent adverse cognitive effect of antipsychotic treatment.", 
    "164": "To image the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in vivo, we previously developed two positron emission tomography (PET) ligands, N-(2-[11C],5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide ([11C]1a) and its [18F]fluoroethyl analogue ([18F]1b), for the investigation of PBR in the living human brain. This time, using 1a as a leading compound, we designed two novel iodinated analogues, N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-iodo-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide (3a) and N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-iodo-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (3b) for the PBR imaging. Ligands 3 were synthesized by the iodination of tributystannyl precursors 10. Radiolabeling for 3 with 131I was carried out by the reaction of 10 with [131I]NaI using H2O2 as an oxidizing agent. In vitro competition experiments determined that 3a exhibited both high affinity and selectivity for PBR (IC50: 7.8 nM) vs CBR (>1 microM). Biodistribution study in mice determined that [131I]3a had a high radioactivity level (1.69% dose/g) in the brain, and its distribution pattern in the brain was consistent with the known distribution of PBR in rodents. Ex vivo autoradiography of the rat brain gave visual evidence that [131I]3a was a potent and specific radioligand for PBR.", 
    "165": "Movement disorder emergencies occur in both hypokinetic and hyperkinetic patients. Prompt recognition of these emergencies is crucial, and diagnosis is based on history and phenomenology. Supportive and temporizing measures must be implemented immediately before disease-specific therapy is begun. For neuroleptic malignant syndrome and related conditions, we recommend a three-tier approach depending on severity, starting with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists or levodopa, and dantrolene or electroconvulsive therapy. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy also is beneficial for neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to abrupt medication withdrawal in patients with Parkinson's disease. In treatment of other acute antidopaminergic-induced emergencies, anticholinergics usually suffice. To manage airway obstruction related to movement disorders, we rely on laryngoscopic evaluation to determine whether noninvasive or invasive interventions are needed. Hyperkinetic emergencies are treated individually based on the type of abnormal movements. If an antidopaminergic is needed, we prefer a dopamine depletor to a dopamine receptor blocker because of the risk of tardive syndromes with the latter. When focal hyperkinetic movements dominate the picture, botulinum toxin injection is a useful adjunct to medications.", 
    "166": "Carisoprodol was developed to create a drug with less potential for abuse than meprobamate. However, case reports have established carisoprodol as a drug of abuse. This paper explores the extent of potential abuse of this drug in Norway.", 
    "167": "The Norwegian Prescription Database contains information on prescription drugs dispensed to individuals in Norway. Patients can be followed over time. High levels of carisoprodol use could indicate use for pleasurable effects or development of tolerance. Concomitant use of other potential drugs of abuse was also studied. We studied drug-seeking behaviour by looking at patients who received carisoprodol from many different pharmacies and doctors or from high-prescribing doctors. Carisoprodol was compared with a series of other medicinal drugs with or without known potential for abuse.", 
    "168": "Some 53,889 Norwegian women (2.4%) and 29,824 men (1.3%) > or =18 years old received carisoprodol at least once in 2004. Prescribing of carisoprodol was skewed. As many as 32% of the patients received more than 15 defined daily doses (DDDs) of carisoprodol and >11,000 patients (15%) received > or =75 DDDs in 2004. High users of carisoprodol also received more benzodiazepines and opioids. Few patients used three or more doctors for prescriptions, but carisoprodol-abusing patients more often received their prescription from high-prescribing doctors.", 
    "169": "Carisoprodol was widely used and the skewedness in use indicated that it is a potential drug of abuse. A large number of patients used more carisoprodol than recommended in the guidelines. The high level of use and abuse of carisoprodol should be of concern in Norway.", 
    "170": "Mitochondrial myopathies make up a group of rare disorders whose onset is in childhood or adolescence. Muscle and central nervous system involvement is variable. Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III deficiency (coenzyme Q - cytochrome C reductase) can manifest as exercise intolerance, myopathy, encephalopathy, and myocardial disease. Approximately 38 patients with complex III deficiency have been described since 1966, yet only a single anesthetic experience (epidural analgesia for cesarean delivery) has been reported. We describe the case of an 11-year-old boy with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III deficiency, severe myopathy, and moderate encephalopathy who underwent surgery to improve right ischiotibial muscle spasticity. Monitoring included electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure, esophageal temperature, spirometry, and neuromuscular block (Relaxograph Datex). Midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol were used for anesthetic induction; mivacurium was used during intubation. Anesthetic maintenance was with propofol in continuous infusion and fractionated doses of fentanyl and mivacurium on demand in a mixture of oxygen and air. The boy's response to mivacurium was abnormal but he could nevertheless be extubated in the operating room at a train-of-four ratio of 75% and with no need to reverse the neuromuscular blockade. There were no problems during the anesthetic procedure, so it could be a good technique for these patients, despite of considering individually every case and extension of syntomatology, due to the little experience in anesthesia with deficiency of Complex III.", 
    "171": "Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is the primary physiologic regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and serves to globally coordinate the mammalian stress response. Hyperactivity of central nervous system CRF neurotransmission, acting primarily via the CRF(1) receptor, has been strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. Furthermore, there is evidence of enhanced CRF transcription, release, and neuronal activity after the administration of and withdrawal from several drugs of abuse, including cannabis, cocaine, ethanol, and morphine. Treatment with CRF antagonists has been demonstrated to reduce the severity of certain drug withdrawal symptoms, implicating a specific role for activation of CRF neurons in mediating the anxiogenic and stress-like reactions observed after abrupt drug discontinuation.",

    "174": "These results indicate that the activation of CRF neuronal systems may be a common neurobiological mechanism in withdrawal from drugs of abuse and moreover, that the CRF(1) receptor subtype plays a major role in mediating the effects of CRF on neuroendocrine and behavioral responses during BZ withdrawal. Therefore, CRF(1) receptor antagonists may be of therapeutic utility in the treatment of drug withdrawal syndromes.", 
    "175": "Bipolar affective disorder is not uncommon in the elderly; prevalence rates in the United States range from 0.1% to 0.4%. However, it accounts for 10% to 25% of all geriatric patients with mood disorders and 5% of patients admitted to geropsychiatric inpatient units. These patients often present a tremendous treatment challenge to clinicians. They frequently have differing treatment needs compared with their younger counterparts because of substantial medical comorbidity and age-related variations in response to therapy. Unfortunately, the management of geriatric bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected compared with the younger population. There continues to be a scarcity of published, controlled trials in the elderly, and no treatment algorithms specific to bipolar disorder in the elderly have been devised.",

    "177": "English-language articles written on the treatment of bipolar disorder in the elderly were identified. The first step in data collection involved a search for evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (up until the third quarter of 2006). Systematic reviews were then located in the following databases: MEDLINE (1966-September 2006), EMBASE (1980-2006 [week 36]), and PsycINFO (1967-September 2006 [week 1]). Additional use was made of these 3 databases in searching for single randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, cohort studies, case-control studies, case series, and case reports. \"Elderly,\" used synonymously with \"geriatric,\" was defined as individuals aged > or =60 years. However, to take into account ambiguity in the nomenclature, the key words aged, geriatric, elderly, and older were combined with words indicating pharmacologic treatments such as pharmacotherapy; classes of medications (eg, lithium, antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines); and names of selected individual medications (eg, lithium, valproic acid, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, gabapentin, zonisamide, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole). These terms were then combined with the diagnostic terms bipolar disorder, mania, hypomania, depression, or bipolar depression. Finally, the terms ECT and psychotherapy were also queried in combination with indicators for age and diagnosis. A few articles on \"older adults,\" usually defined as individuals aged 50 to 55 years, were also included. They may allow for possible extrapolation of data to the geriatric population. Additionally, several mixed-age studies were included for similar considerations. Case reports and case series were described for their potential heuristic value.", 
    "178": "Unfortunately, there is a considerable dearth of literature involving evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and even randomized controlled trials in elderly individuals with bipolar disorder. Available options for the treatment of bipolar disorder (including those for mania, hypomania, depression, or maintenance) in the elderly include lithium, antiepileptics, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and psychotherapy.", 
    "179": "The data for the treatment of late-life bipolar disorder are limited, but the available evidence shows efficacy for some commonly used treatments. Lithium, divalproex sodium, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, atypical antipsychotics, and antidepressants have all been found to be beneficial in the treatment of elderly patients with bipolar disorder. Although there are no specific guidelines for the treatment of these patients, monotherapy followed by combination therapy of the various classes of drugs may help with the resolution of symptoms. ECT and psychotherapy may be useful in the treatment of refractory disease. There is a need for more controlled studies in this age group before definitive treatment strategies can be enumerated.", 
    "180": "The anxiolytic effect of the saponins from Aniliaeea Panax quinquefolium L. (PQS) was studied in male mice by using a number of experimental paradigms of anxiety and compared with that of the known anxiolytic compound diazepam. Use of the elevated plus-maze test revealed that PQS (50 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) increased the percentage of time and entries spent in open arms. In the light/dark test, PQS (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) prolonged the time spent in the light area. In the hole-board test, PQS (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly increased both head-dip counts and head-dip duration. Both PQS (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased the total fighting time in the isolation-induced aggressive test. Since PQS, in contrast to diazepam, had no effect on locomotion in these tests, its side-effect profile might be considered superior to the benzodiazepines. Thus, the present findings suggest that PQS might be a potential candidate for use as an anxiolytic drug.", 
    "181": "Effective treatment options for hepatic encephalopathy are limited. Based on the principle that intestinal-derived ammonia contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, current therapeutic approaches are directed at reducing bacterial production of ammonia and enhancing its elimination. Non-absorbable disaccharides are first-line therapy for hepatic encephalopathy, but published clinical studies evaluating their safety and efficacy are limited. Alternative therapies such as benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, branched-chain amino acids, and l-ornithine-l-aspartate also have limited clinical data supporting their use. Studies of antibiotics indicate that they are effective in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, but adverse effects and concerns about long-term safety have limited the widespread use of most. Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed antibiotic that concentrates in the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted mostly unchanged in faeces. It has been studied extensively in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and appears to confer therapeutic benefits greater than those of placebo and non-absorbable disaccharides and at least comparable with those of systemic antibiotics. Rifaximin was also well tolerated in patients with hepatic encephalopathy and is not associated with clinical drug interactions or clinically relevant bacterial antibiotic resistance. In conclusion, non-absorbed antibiotics such as rifaximin offer a favourable benefit-risk ratio in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and may help to improve patient outcomes.", 
    "182": "The aetiology of hepatic encephalopathy has not been conclusively established, but it is widely agreed that ammonia derived primarily from enteric bacterial flora plays a central role. Recent research on the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy reinforces previous findings, supporting an integral role of bacteria-derived ammonia and reveals other potential mechanisms by which bacterial flora and pathogens may be pathophysiologically important. This review discusses this research and considers its implications for the therapeutic management of hepatic encephalopathy. Besides producing ammonia, the enteric flora generates other neurotoxic products, such as phenols and mercaptans, that may potentiate the effects of ammonia. Bacteria may also constitute a primary source of the benzodiazepine-like compounds implicated in neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with liver disease. New evidence suggests that acute bacterial infections, long recognized as important precipitants of hepatic encephalopathy, may mediate clinical worsening through effects on systemic inflammatory responses. Considered together, these data suggest wide-ranging pathophysiological contributions of bacteria to hepatic encephalopathy and underline the potential for an integral role of antibiotics and other bactericidal agents in its management.", 
    "183": "The effect of benzodiazepines on attention has been the object of few investigations. Studies using the spatial cueing paradigm (Posner's paradigm) have reported inconsistent results, which are likely due to methodological and/or dose differences but suggest impaired disengagement of attention from the cue to the target. The authors investigated the effect of a benzodiazepine (diazepam) on attentional shifting in the temporal domain. The attentional blink effect refers to difficulties in detecting a target if it follows the identification of a previous target occurring within a temporal window of 200-400 ms. The authors assessed whether the duration of the attentional blink was affected by diazepam. Streams of 15 real-world scenes displaying a road were presented for 50 ms each. A city name (target) appeared at Serial Positions 2, 3, or 4 of each stream. A vehicle (probe) appeared at different intervals following the city name. In a dual-task condition, participants were asked to report the city name and whether a vehicle was present. In a control condition, participants had to report only the presence of a vehicle and ignore the city name. Thirty-six healthy volunteers were assigned to 3 groups (placebo, diazepam 0.1 mg/kg, or 0.3 mg/kg). Diazepam increased both the magnitude and duration of the attentional blink effect. Participants treated with a high dose of diazepam needed more than 600 ms to detect a vehicle following identification of the name. Results suggest that diazepam at a therapeutic dosage affects attentional shifting in the temporal domain and impairs dual-task performance.", 
    "184": "Several species of the genus Passiflora, known in Brazil as 'maracuj\u00e1', have widespread use in folk medicine as sedatives and anxiolytics. The anxiolytic activities of aqueous and hydroalcohol extracts of Passiflora quadrangularis leaves were evaluated using the elevated plus-maze, open field and holeboard tests. The hydroalcohol extract presented results suggestive of anxiolytic activity in dosages around 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg, as expressed by elevation of the time spent on the open arms in the plus-maze; a decrease of freezing and an increase of deambulation and rearing in the open field test. The hydroalcohol extract showed results similar to diazepam on the holeboard. No positive results were found for the aqueous extract.", 
    "185": "This study was designed to determine whether biofeedback is more effective than diazepam or placebo in a randomized, controlled trial for patients with pelvic floor dyssynergia-type constipation, and whether instrumented biofeedback is necessary for successful training.",

The 84 who remained constipated were randomized to biofeedback (n=30), diazepam (n=30), or placebo (n=24). All patients were trained to do pelvic floor muscle exercises to correct pelvic floor dyssynergia during six biweekly one-hour sessions, but only biofeedback patients received electromyography feedback. All other patients received pills one to two hours before attempting defecation. Diary data on cathartic use, straining, incomplete bowel movements, Bristol stool scores, and compliance with homework were reviewed biweekly.", 
    "187": "Before treatment, the groups did not differ on demographic (average age, 50 years; 85 percent females), physiologic or psychologic characteristics, severity of constipation, or expectation of benefit. Biofeedback was superior to diazepam by intention-to-treat analysis (70 vs. 23 percent reported adequate relief of constipation 3 months after treatment, chi-squared=13.1, P<0.001), and also superior to placebo (38 percent successful, chi-squared=5.7, P=0.017). Biofeedback patients had significantly more unassisted bowel movements at follow-up compared with placebo (P=0.005), with a trend favoring biofeedback over diazepam (P=0.067). Biofeedback patients reduced pelvic floor electromyography during straining significantly more than diazepam patients (P<0.001).",

    "189": "Opening of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pores leads to mitochondrial injury during oxidative stress. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) located at mitochondrial outer-membrane has been shown to be involved in several mitochondrial functions. In the present study, we used Ro5-4864, a PBR agonist, to test if activation of PBR could prevent MPT pore opening during Ca(2+) overloading. Cardiac mitochondria isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats were treated by 150 mmol/L Ca(2+) to induce MPT. Ro5-4864 (50, 100 and 200 micromol/L) was added into incubation buffer before adding 150 micromol/L Ca(2+). In additional group, atractyloside (ATR, 20 micromol/L), an opener of MPT pores was added 5 min before the addition of 100 micromol/L Ro5-4864. The change of absorbance at 520 nm was monitored with a spectrophotometer at 30 degrees C for 10 min. Western blot was used to detect cytochrome C loss. The mitochondrial membrane potential was monitored with the fluorescence dye JC-1. Ro5-4864 inhibited the decrease of absorbance at 520 nm compared to that in the untreated Ca(2+) group (P<0.01, P<0.05). In the presence of ATR, Ro5-4864 was not able to prevent MPT anymore. Opening of MPT pores by Ca(2+) decreased the content of cytochrome C in mitochondria, but increased cytochrome C content in cytosol. Ro5-4864 preserved cytochrome C content in mitochondria and led to less cytochrome C release to cytosol. ATR treatment reversed the protective effect of Ro5-4864 on cytochrome C content. Opening of MPT pores led to mitochondrial depolarization, whereas Ro5-4864 treatment maintained mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, prevention of MPT by activation of PBR during calcium overloading maintains mitochondrial cytochrome C content and membrane potential. Activation of PBR during cardiac ischemia and reperfusion may be an alternative way for cardioprotection.",

Case reports of alopecia associated with quetiapine reported to the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme were reviewed. The World Health Organization international spontaneous reporting database was also searched for additional case reports. Literature searches were conducted for previous reports of alopecia associated with quetiapine. The Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme database included two case reports of alopecia associated with quetiapine. Assessment of these cases suggested a causal relationship with the medicine. The World Health Organization international database included a further 15 case reports, providing evidence supporting this association. No previously published reports of alopecia associated with quetiapine were identified. In conclusion, these are the first published case reports of alopecia associated with quetiapine.", 
    "191": "In this study, the Authors assessed some insulin counter-regulatory factors, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein after olanzapine administration, and the effect of metformin on these variables, 37 patients with chronic schizophrenia were given olanzapine (10 mg/day for 14 weeks). Nineteen patients received metformin (850-2550 mg/day) and 18 received placebo in a randomized, double-blind protocol. The following variables were quantified before and after olanzapine: cortisol, leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, glucagon, growth hormone, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein. Results were correlated with the changes in body weight and the insulin resistance index. We have reported elsewhere that metformin did not prevent olanzapine-induced weight gain, and the insulin resistance index significantly decreased after metformin and placebo; Baptista T, et al. Can J Psychiatry 2006; 51: 192-196. Cortisol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and fibrinogen levels significantly decreased in both groups. Glucagon significantly increased after metformin (P=0.03). Leptin tended to increase after placebo (P=0.1) and displayed a small nonsignificant reduction after metformin. The C-reactive protein did not change significantly in any group. Contrarily to most published studies, olanzapine was associated with decreased insulin resistance. Decrements in cortisol, fibrinogen and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels point to an improvement in the metabolic profile. The trend for leptin to increase after placebo, but not after metformin in spite of similar weight gain suggests a beneficial effect of this antidiabetic agent.",

Status epilepticus was defined as a prolonged (>30 min) tonic-clonic seizure irrespective of whether the seizure had stopped prior to admission to PICU. During this period, 137 (74 male) children aged 1 month to 15 years were admitted to PICU with 147 episodes of status epilepticus. Forty-seven of the 137 children (34%) were admitted following a prolonged febrile seizure. Thirty-eight of the 137 children (28%) had a remote symptomatic cause for the CSE, 24 (18%) were admitted for an acute symptomatic cause and 15 (11%) were admitted with an acute exacerbation of a pre-existing idiopathic/cryptogenic epilepsy. Six children had a progressive encephalopathy and no cause was identified in the remaining 7 of the 137 children (5%). Forty-nine (36%) of the 137 children had pre-existing epilepsy. The mean duration of CSE was 44 min. Forty-nine (36%) children admitted to PICU who had received a benzodiazepine with either phenobarbital or phenytoin, required further treatment to terminate the presenting episode of CSE. Forty-two of these 49 were treated with thiopentone anaesthesia and the remaining 7 with a continuous infusion of midazolam, successfully terminating status in all. No child died. Of the 70 children considered to be previously neurologically and developmentally normal prior to admission, only 1 child demonstrated a new gross neurological abnormality at the time of latest follow-up. Seven patients (5%) developed new or de novo epilepsy."
