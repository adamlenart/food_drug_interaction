In particular, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([BMIM][NTf2]) was the best IL additive for the separation system because its anionic moiety interacted favorably with the benzodiazepines. We added SDS because of its known effect on the separation of hydrophobic analytes. We optimized the separation conditions in terms of the concentrations of the IL, SDS, and organic solvent, the pH, and the BGE's ionic strength. The optimal BGE, containing 170 mM [BMIM][NTf2] and 10 mM SDS, provided baseline separation, high efficiency, and satisfactory peak shapes for the benzodiazepines. The separation mechanism was based on heteroassociation between the anionic moiety of the IL and the benzodiazepines, with SDS improving the resolution of the separation. The limits of detection for the seven analytes ranged from 2.74 to 4.42 microg/mL. We subjected a urine sample to off-line solid phase extraction (SPE) prior to the analysis of its benzodiazepine content. Our experimental results reveal that the combination of [BMIM][NTf2] and SDS provides adequate separation efficiency for its application to CE analyses of benzodiazepines after SPE concentration.", 
    "14": "Raman spectroscopy has become an attractive tool for the analysis of pharmaceutical solid dosage forms. In the present study it is used to ensure the identity of tablets. The two main applications of this method are release of final products in quality control and detection of counterfeits. Twenty-five product families of tablets have been included in the spectral library and a non-linear classification method, the Support Vector Machines (SVMs), has been employed. Two calibrations have been developed in cascade: the first one identifies the product family while the second one specifies the formulation. A product family comprises different formulations that have the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) but in a different amount. Once the tablets have been classified by the SVM model, API peaks detection and correlation are applied in order to have a specific method for the identification and allow in the future to discriminate counterfeits from genuine products. This calibration strategy enables the identification of 25 product families without error and in the absence of prior information about the sample. Raman spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics is therefore a fast and accurate tool for the identification of pharmaceutical tablets.",

Four blood samples at steady state were obtained from each patient. Olanzapine concentrations in plasma were determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method with electrochemical detection. Similar data from 11 adolescents from three previous studies were also included. A pharmacokinetic model was developed and the potential effects of patient characteristics (sex, bodyweight, age, ethnic origin) were investigated using a nonlinear mixed effects modeling program.

Interpatient variability (40.5% for CL/F, 65.4% for V/F) and residual error (27%) were moderate. Bodyweight and sex had a significant influence on CL/F, which was lower in patients with lower weights and approximately 30% higher in males than females.

The overall attrition from the included studies was considerable (49.2%) leaving the interpretation of results problematic.Olanzapine improved the general mental state (PANSS total score) more than aripiprazole (2 RCTs, n=794, WMD -4.96 CI -8.06 to -1.85), quetiapine (10 RCTs, n=1449, WMD -3.66 CI -5.39 to -1.93), risperidone (15 RCTs, n=2390, WMD -1.94 CI -3.31 to -0.58) and ziprasidone (4 RCTs, n=1291, WMD -8.32 CI -10.99 to -5.64), but not more than amisulpride or clozapine. This somewhat better efficacy was confirmed by fewer participants in the olanzapine groups leaving the studies early due to inefficacy of treatment compared to quetiapine (8 RCTs, n=1563, RR 0.56 CI 0.44 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 6 to 50), risperidone (14 RCTs, n=2744, RR 0.78 CI 0.62 to 0.98, NNT 50 CI 17 to 100) and ziprasidone (5 RCTs, n=1937, RR 0.64 CI 0.51 to 0.79, NNT 17, CI 11 to 33).Fewer participants in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (2 RCTs, n=876, RR 0.56 CI 0.41 to 0.77, NNT 11 CI 7 to 25) and ziprasidone (2 RCTs, n=766, RR 0.65 CI 0.45 to 0.93, NNT 17 CI 9 to 100) treatment groups, but not in the clozapine group (1 RCT, n=980, RR 1.28 CI 1.02 to 1.61, NNH not estimable), had to be re-hospitalised in the trials.Except for clozapine, all comparators induced less weight gain than olanzapine (olanzapine compared to amisulpride: 3 RCTs, n=671, WMD 2.11kg CI 1.29kg to 2.94kg; aripiprazole: 1 RCT, n=90, WMD 5.60kg CI 2.15kg to 9.05kg; quetiapine: 7 RCTs, n=1173, WMD 2.68kg CI 1.10kg to 4.26kg; risperidone: 13 RCTs, n=2116, WMD 2.61kg CI 1.48kg to 3.74kg; ziprasidone: 5 RCTs, n=1659, WMD 3.82kg CI 2.96kg to 4.69kg). Associated problems such as glucose and cholesterol increase were usually also more frequent in the olanzapine group.Other differences in adverse effects were less well documented. Nevertheless, olanzapine may be associated with slightly more extrapyramidal side effects than quetiapine (use of antiparkinson medication (6 RCTs, n=1090, RR 2.05 CI 1.26 to 3.32, NNH 25 CI 14 to 100), but less than risperidone (use of antiparkinson medication 13 RCTs, n=2599, RR 0.78 CI 0.65 to 0.95, NNH 17 CI 9 to 100) and ziprasidone (use of antiparkinson medication 4 RCTs, n=1732, RR 0.70 CI 0.50 to 0.97, NNH not estimable). It may also increase prolactin somewhat more than aripiprazole, clozapine and quetiapine, but clearly less so than risperidone (6 RCTs, n=1291, WMD -22.84 CI -27.98 to -17.69).",

This small superiority in efficacy needs to be weighed against a larger weight gain and associated metabolic problems than most other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except clozapine.

The literature presents more studies on the EO of C. citratus and their isolated bioactive components, but only a few are found on the EO of C. winterianus. The objective of the present study was then to study, in a comparative way, the effects of both EOs on three models of convulsions (pentylenetetrazol, pilocarpine, and strychnine) and on the barbiturate-induced sleeping time on male Swiss mice. The animals (20-30 g) were acutely treated with 50, 100, and 200 mg kg(-1), intraperitoneally, of each EO, and 30 min later, the test was initiated. The observed parameters were: latency to the first convulsion and latency to death in seconds. Furthermore, the in vitro effects of the EOs were also studied on myeloperoxidase (MPO; a biomarker for inflammation) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; an index of cytotoxicity) releases from human neutrophils. The EOs radical-scavenging activities were also evaluated by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The results showed that both EOs were more active on the pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsion model, and C. citratus was even more efficient in increasing latency to the first convulsion and latency to death. Both parameters were potentiated in the presence of a lower dose of diazepam (reference drug) when associated to a lower dose of each EO (25 mg kg(-1)). Besides, their anticonvulsant effects were blocked by flumazenil, a known benzodiazepine antagonist. This effect was somewhat lower on the pilocarpine-induced convulsion, and better effects were seen only with the EOs' higher doses (200 mg kg(-1)). A similar result was observed on the strychnine-induced convulsion model. Both EOs potentiated the barbiturate-induced sleeping time. However, C. citratus was more efficient. Interestingly, both EOs completely blocked the MPO release from human neutrophils and showed no cytotoxic effect on the LDH release from human neutrophils. On the other hand, only a very low or no effect on the DPPH assay was observed with C. winterianus and C. citratus, respectively, indicating that the radical scavenging activity did not play a role on the EOs' effects. We conclude that the mechanism of action of the anticonvulsant effect of the EOs studied is, at least in part, dependent upon the GABAergic neurotransmission. In addition, their effects on inflammatory biomarkers can also contribute to their central nervous system activity.",

Headache Index (HI) and Daily Drug Intake (DDI) were used for evaluating the severity of headache and medication overuse. The patients were treated by abrupt discontinuation of the overused drug and by a therapeutic protocol including i.v. hydration, dexhamethasone, metoclopramide, and benzodiazepines for 7-15 days. Prophylactic medication was started at the beginning of therapeutic protocol. Patients underwent follow-up controls 1, 3, and 6 months after discharge. The initial diagnosis was MOH in all patients included in the study. The overused medications were simple analgesics in 18 cases (25.7%), combination analgesics in 26 cases (37.1%), triptans alone in 9 cases (12.9%), or in combination with analgesics in 13 cases (18.6%), and ergot derivatives (in combination) in 4 cases (5.7%).

These studies also found that smokers require higher doses of these agents than nonsmokers. There are case reports of adverse clinical outcomes following smoking cessation in patients being treated with olanzapine and clozapine. Reports that included serum concentrations consistently found elevations following smoking cessation, and dosage reductions of 30-40% were required to achieve pre-cessation concentrations.

Toxicity as a result of recent smoking reduction or cessation may be a reason for hospital admission. For hospitalized patients, pharmacists should obtain information concerning smoking status, including cessation attempts. Nonspecific signs and symptoms of elevated clozapine or olanzapine concentrations should be considered in relation to clinical status while the patient is hospitalized. Measurement of baseline serum clozapine concentrations and/or empiric dosage adjustment in patients expected to have a prolonged hospital stay with forced smoking cessation may be appropriate.", 
    "74": "Drug-induced hepatotoxicity is an important cause for disapproval, limitations of use, or withdrawal of drugs, and there is a high need for reproducible in vitro systems that can predict such toxicity. In this study, we show that confluent growth of the human hepatoma cell line Huh7 up to 5 weeks results in increased gene expression of several cytochromes P450 (P450s), UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, transporters, transcription factors, and several liver-specific genes, as measured by low-density array. The most striking effect was seen for CYP3A4 expression. Western blot analysis revealed increased amounts of CYP3A4 together with increased levels of NADPH-P450 reductase, cytochrome b(5), and albumin with prolonged time of confluence. By using the CYP3A4-specific substrates luciferin 6' benzyl ether, testosterone, and midazolam, we could confirm that the increased CYP3A4 gene expression also was accompanied by a similar increase in catalytic activity, inhibitable by the CYP3A4-selective inhibitor ketoconazole. The CYP3A4 activity in confluent cells was also inducible by rifampicin. Finally, the cell system could support the CYP3A4-dependent hepatotoxic activation of aflatoxin B(1), which was effectively inhibited by ketoconazole. Our results show that Huh7 cells grown confluent differentiate into a more metabolically competent cell line, especially with regard to CYP3A4.", 
    "75": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) is the target of many depressants, including benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and alcohol. Although the highly prevalent alphabetagamma GABA(A)R subtype mediates the majority of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain, receptors containing delta subunits also play a key role, mediating tonic inhibition and the actions of endogenous neurosteroids and alcohol. However, the fundamental properties of delta-containing GABA(A)Rs, such as subunit stoichiometry, are not well established. To determine subunit stoichiometry of expressed delta-containing GABA(A)Rs, we inserted the alpha-bungarotoxin binding site tag in the alpha(4), beta(2), and delta subunit N termini. An enhanced green fluorescent protein tag was also inserted into the beta(2) subunit to shift its molecular weight, allowing us to separate subunits using SDS-PAGE. Tagged alpha(4)beta(2)delta GABA(A)Rs were expressed in HEK293T cells using various ratios of subunit cDNA, and receptor subunit stoichiometry was determined by quantitating fluorescent alpha-bungarotoxin bound to each subunit on Western blots of surface immunopurified tagged GABA(A)Rs. The results demonstrate that the subunit stoichiometry of alpha(4)beta(2)delta GABA(A)Rs is regulated by the ratio of subunit cDNAs transfected. Increasing the ratio of delta subunit cDNA transfected increased delta subunit incorporation into surface receptors with a concomitant decrease in beta(2) subunit incorporation. Because receptor subunit stoichiometry can directly influence GABA(A)R pharmacological and functional properties, considering how the transfection protocols used affect subunit stoichiometry is essential when studying heterologously expressed alpha(4)beta(2)delta GABA(A)Rs. Successful bungarotoxin binding site tagging of GABA(A)R subunits is a novel tool with which to accurately quantitate subunit stoichiometry and will be useful for monitoring GABA(A)R trafficking in live cells.",

Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups for both septic and non-septic patients. Compared with septic patients who received lorazepam, the dexmedetomidine septic patients had 3.2 more delirium/coma-free days (DCFD) on average (95% CI for difference, 1.1 to 4.9), 1.5 (-0.1, 2.8) more delirium-free days (DFD) and 6 (0.3, 11.1) more ventilator-free days (VFD). The beneficial effects of dexmedetomidine were more pronounced in septic patients than in non-septic patients for both DCFDs and VFDs (P-value for interaction = 0.09 and 0.02 respectively). Additionally, sedation with dexmedetomidine, compared with lorazepam, reduced the daily risk of delirium [OR, CI 0.3 (0.1, 0.7)] in both septic and non-septic patients (P-value for interaction = 0.94). Risk of dying at 28 days was reduced by 70% [hazard ratio 0.3 (0.1, 0.9)] in dexmedetomidine patients with sepsis as compared to the lorazepam patients; this reduction in death was not seen in non-septic patients (P-value for interaction = 0.11).",

Traditional methods for measuring affinity involve radiolabeled ligands. To address the need for homogeneous biochemical fluorescent assays to characterize orthosteric ligand affinity and dissociation rates, we have developed a fluorescence anisotropy (FA) assay for the muscarinic M1 receptor that can be conducted in a 384-well plate. We used membranes from a muscarinic M1 cell line optimized for high-throughput functional assays and the previously characterized fluorescent antagonist BODIPY FL pirenzepine. The affinities of reference compounds were determined in the competitive FA assay and compared with those obtained with a competitive filter-based radioligand-binding assay using [(3)H] N-methylscopolamine. The IC(50) values produced from the FA assay were well-correlated with the radioligand-binding K(i) values (R(2) = 0.98). The dissociation of the BODIPY FL pirenzepine was readily monitored in real time using the FA assay and was sensitive to the presence of the allosteric modulator gallamine. This M1 FA assay offers advantages over traditional radioligandbinding assays as it eliminates radioactivity while allowing investigation of orthosteric or allosteric muscarinic M1 ligands in a homogeneous format.",

Orodispersible tablets of diazepam were prepared using different types of superdisintegrants (Ac-Di-Sol, sodium starch glycolate, and crospovidone (CP)) and different types of subliming agents (camphor and ammonium bicarbonate (AB)) at different concentrations and two methods of tablets preparations (wet granulation and direct compression methods). The formulations were evaluated for flow properties, wetting time, hardness, friability, content uniformity, in vivo disintegration time (DT), release profiles, and buccal absorption tests. All formulations showed satisfactory mechanical strength except formula F5 which contains camphor and formula F9 which is prepared by direct compression method. The results revealed that the tablets containing CP as a superdisintegrant have good dissolution profile with shortest DT. The optimized formula F7 is prepared using 10% CP as a superdisintegrant and 20% AB as a subliming agent by wet granulation method which shows the shortest DT and good dissolution profile with acceptable stability. This study helps in revealing the effect of formulation processing variables on tablet properties. It can be concluded that the orodispersible tablets of diazepam with better biopharmaceutical properties than conventional tablets could be obtained using formula F7.",

In the last attempt on whale #1102 there appeared to be a mild effect in 20-30 minutes, with duration of less than 2 hours that included exhalation before the blowhole fully cleared the water. Boat avoidance, used as a measure of sedation depth, was not reduced. A second severely entangled animal in 2009, whale #3311, received midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) followed by butorphanol (0.03 mg/kg) an hour later, delivered ballistically. Two months later it was then given midazolam (0.07 mg/kg) and butorphanol (0.07 mg/kg) simultaneously. The next day both drugs at 0.1 mg/kg were given as a mixture in two darts 10 minutes apart. The first attempt on whale #3311 showed increased swimming speed and boat avoidance was observed after a further 20 minutes. The second attempt on whale #3311 showed respiration increasing mildly in frequency and decreasing in strength. The third attempt on whale #3311 gave a statistically significant increase in respiratory frequency an hour after injection, with increased swimming speed and marked reduction of boat evasion that enabled decisive cuts to entangling gear.",

    "114": "Recent evidence suggests that alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptors mediate the sedative, amnestic, and to some extent the anticonvulsant actions of non-selective benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands, such as diazepam (DZ). Anxiolytic and in part, anticonvulsant actions of BZ ligands are mediated by alpha2-, alpha3-, and alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors. This has resulted in increasing interest in developing BZ ligands with selective actions at GABA(A) receptors, including alpha2-, alpha3-, and alpha5-subunits, but devoid of efficacy at alpha1-containing receptors. To refine their spectrum of pharmacological actions, efforts are being made to minimize unwanted effects such as sedation, amnesia, and tolerance liabilities. A prototype for such BZ ligands is imidazenil (IMD), an imidazo-benzodiazepine carboxylic acid derivative that elicits potent anticonvulsant and anxiolytic actions at doses virtually devoid of sedative, cardio-respiratory depressant and amnestic effects, and anticonvulsant tolerance liability. To define the pharmacological profile of IMD and its derivatives, we compared the anticonflict (anxiolytic), anti-proconflict (antipanic), anti-bicuculline (BIC), and maximal electroshock seizure (MES) effects, and the suppression of locomotor activity by imidazo-benzodiazepine carboxylic acid derivatives to those of DZ and bretazenil (BTZ). We report here that IMD and one of its derivatives (RO 25-2775) possess dose-dependent anticonflict, anti-proconflict, and anti-BIC actions but failed to suppress locomotor activity. Like DZ, the other IMD derivatives (enazenil, RO 25-2776, and RO 25-2847) not only elicit dose-dependent anticonflict, anti-proconflict, anti-BIC, anti-MES effects but also suppress locomotor activity. In contrast, none of the IMD derivatives studied shows any similarity to BTZ, which elicits anticonflict, anti-proconflict actions and suppresses locomotor activity but is virtually inactive against BIC-induced tonic-clonic convulsions.", 
    "115": "Given the function of the esophagus to transport orally ingested solids and liquids into the stomach there are several medications with adverse effect on esophageal structures and function. Various pharmacologic agents can induce esophageal injury, promote gastroesophageal reflux by decreasing lower esophageal sphincter tone or affect esophageal perception and motility. The risks of bisphosphonates, doxycycline, ferrous sulfate, ascorbic acid, aspirin/NSAIDs and chemotherapeutic agents to induce esophageal lesions have been documented in case reports and short series. In addition to direct mucosal injury, many commonly used medications including nitroglycerins, anticholinergics, beta-adrenergic agonists, aminophyllines, and benzodiazepines promote/facilitate gastroesophageal reflux by reducing lower esophageal sphincter pressure. Additional evidence accumulates on the adverse effects of various medications on esophageal motility and perception. The treatment of medication-induced esophageal lesions includes (1) identifying and discontinuing the causative medication, (2) promoting healing of esophageal injury by decreasing esophageal acid exposure or coating already existing esophageal lesions, (3) eventual use of protective compounds.", 
    "116": "Zolpidem is a widely prescribed sleep aid with relative selectivity for GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1-3 subunits. We examined the effects of zolpidem on the inhibitory currents mediated by GABA(A) receptors using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from DMV neurons in transverse brainstem slices from rat. Zolpidem prolonged the decay time of mIPSCs and of muscimol-evoked whole-cell GABAergic currents, and it occasionally enhanced the amplitude of mIPSCs. The effects were blocked by flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. Zolpidem also hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential, with a concomitant decrease in input resistance and action potential firing activity in a subset of cells. Zolpidem did not clearly alter the GABA(A) receptor-mediated tonic current (I(tonic)) under baseline conditions, but after elevating extracellular GABA concentration with nipecotic acid, a non-selective GABA transporter blocker, zolpidem consistently and significantly increased the tonic GABA current. This increase was suppressed by flumazenil and gabazine. These results suggest that alpha1-3 subunits are expressed in synaptic GABA(A) receptors on DMV neurons. The baseline tonic GABA current is likely not mediated by these same low affinity, zolpidem-sensitive GABA(A) receptors. However, when the extracellular GABA concentration is increased, zolpidem-sensitive extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1-3 subunits contribute to the I(tonic).",

With this as a starting point, we then used bioinformatic predictions about fungal adenylation domain selectivities to identify and confirm an anthranilate-activating module in the fumiquinazoline A producer Aspergillus fumigatus Af293 as well as a second anthranilate-activating NRPS in N. fischeri. This establishes an anthranilate adenylation domain code for fungal NRPS and should facilitate detection and cloning of gene clusters for benzodiazepine- and quinazoline-containing polycyclic alkaloids with a wide range of biological activities.",

In the first study, we studied the analgesic effect of combined posterior lumbar plexus (PLP) and sciatic nerve blocks as well as combined femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, and sciatic nerve blocks during and for 24 h after surgery. The second study was conducted to compare the analgesic effect of the combination of femoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, and sciatic nerve blocks with and without an obturator nerve block. Finally, we compared a postoperative continuous femoral nerve block and PLP block both during and for 48 h after surgery.",

    "126": "The pharmacology of Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate-gated chloride (GluCl) channels was determined by making intracellular voltage-clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes expressing GluCl subunits. As previously reported (Cully et al. 1994), GluClalpha1beta responded to glutamate (in a picrotoxin sensitive manner) and ivermectin, while GluClbeta responded only to glutamate and GluClalpha1 only to ivermectin. This assay was used to further investigate the action of chloride channel compounds. The arylaminobenzoate, NPPB, reduced the action of glutamate on the heteromeric GluClalpha1beta channel (IC(50) 6.03 +/- 0.81 microM). The disulphonate stilbene, DNDS, blocked the effect of both glutamate and ivermectin on GluClalpha1beta channels, the action of glutamate on GluClbeta subunits, and the effect of ivermectin on GluClalpha1 subunits (IC(50)s 1.58-3.83 microM). Surprisingly, amobarbital and pentobarbital, otherwise known as positive allosteric modulators of ligand-gated chloride channels, acted as antagonists. Both compounds reduced the action of glutamate on the GluClalpha1beta heteromer (IC(50)s of 2.04 +/- 0.5 and 17.56 +/- 2.16 microM, respectively). Pentobarbital reduced the action of glutamate on the GluClbeta homomeric subunit with an IC(50) of 0.59 +/- 0.09 microM, while reducing the responses to ivermectin on both GluClalpha1beta and GluClalpha1 with IC(50)s of 8.7 +/- 0.5 and 12.9 +/- 2.5 microM, respectively. For all the antagonists, the mechanism is apparently non-competitive. The benzodiazepine, flurazepam had no apparent effect on these glutamate- and ivermectin-gated chloride channel subunits. Thus, arylaminobenzoates, disulphonate stilbenes, and barbiturates are non-competitive antagonists of C. elegans GluCl channels.", 
    "127": "Stress exposure induces long lasting neurobiological changes in selected brain areas, which could be associated with the emergence of negative emotional responses. In the present study, previously restrained animals exhibited excessive anxiety one day later in the elevated plus maze. We explore whether stress exposure affects the expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and of its activator protein p35, in diverse amygdaloid nuclei. Stress exposure enhanced p35 levels selectively in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). This up-regulation might be functionally associated with the occurrence of exaggerated anxiety since such emotional response was selectively reversed by an intra-BLA infusion of olomoucine, a Cdk5 inhibitor, 15 min prior to the restraint session. Moreover, pre-treatment with midazolam, a benzodiazepine ligand, not only prevented the excessive anxiety but also attenuated the p35 increase in the BLA of stressed rats. In conclusion, we suggest a pivotal role of the Cdk5/p35 complex, specifically in BLA in the excessive anxiety induced by a previous stressful experience.",

Eighteen guinea pigs were divided into three dosage groups (10, 100, and 500 microg/kg) and administrated a single dose of triazolam intragastrically. Before administration, drug-free hair was shaved from their back. Newly grown hair in shaved area was collected every seven days after administration. About 20 mg of decontaminated hair was cut into small segments and incubated in 2 mL of phosphate buffer (pH 8.4) at 45 degrees C overnight. Triazolam-d(4) and alpha-hydroxytriazolam-d(4) were used as internal standards, and liquid-liquid extraction was performed with 3 mL of ethyl ether. The sample was separated on an Allure propyl PFP column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile/20 mM ammonium acetate (7:3, v/v). Detection was implemented with multiple reaction monitoring mode by an API4000 triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. Limits of detection for triazolam and alpha-hydroxytriazolam were 1 and 5 pg/mg, respectively. Triazolam and alpha-hydroxytriazolam could only be detected in the first week, and 100 microg/kg was the minimal dosage detectable in guinea pig hair. The concentration of triazolam in hair was related with administration dosage and hair color. alpha-Hydroxytriazolam has a higher concentration than triazolam in guinea pig hair.",

    "139": "Zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, acts selectively via the alpha(1)-subunit of GABA(A) receptors at therapeutic doses. It is therefore thought to lack both benzodiazepine properties such as anxiolysis, anticonvulsion, muscle relaxation, and side effects such as dependency. We report a case of severe dependency of zolpidem taken because of percieved myorelaxation in a patient with multiple sclerosis and paraspasticity. The observations in the patient described here suggest that zolpidem looses alpha1-receptor selectivity at higher doses, thereby leading to the same risks and benefits such as benzodiazepines. This should be taken into account by doctors when prescribing higher doses. Zolpidem may improve symptoms of spasticity in high doses via affection of GABA alpha2-receptor and alpha3-receptor subunits.",

Comorbid patients tended to have higher abuse of benzodiazepines, alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine, but not of heroin. They had received a significantly lower D,L- (P<0.05) and L-methadone dose than non-comorbid subjects. The duration of maintenance treatment showed an inverse relationship to frequency of additional heroin intake (P<0.01). Patients with additional heroin intake over the past 30 days had been treated with a significantly lower L-methadone dosage (P<0.05) than patients without. Axis-I comorbidity appears to be decreased when relatively higher dosages of D,L- (and L-methadone) are administered; comorbid individuals, however, were on significantly lower dosages. Finally, L-, but not D,L-methadone seems to be more effective in reducing additional heroin abuse.",

The subjects were 59 Japanese schizophrenic patients (35 males and 24 females; age range: 18-46 years; mean+/-SD: 25+/-16 years). The patients were treated with risperidone (n=32) in a dose range of 2-6 mg/day (mean+/-SD=3.4+/-1.9), olanzapine (n=18) in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day (mean+/-SD=12.1+/-5.8), or aripiprazole (n=9) in a dose range of 12-30 mg/day (mean+/-SD=22.8+/-10.1). All three drugs significantly decreased plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) levels within 8 weeks, although aripiprazole transiently raised this level before 8 weeks. All three drugs also significantly increased plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) levels within 8 weeks. On the other hand, none of them altered plasma BDNF levels. These results indicate that risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole affect catecholaminergic systems in the brain, that the effects of aripiprazole on the dopaminergic systems seem to slightly different than those of risperidone and olanzapine, and that these atypical antipsychotic drugs might not alter BDNF levels, at least within 8 weeks of treatment.",

In the present study we aimed to investigate the possible association between serum BDNF levels and schizophrenic relapses and the possible differential effects of treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotics on serum BDNF levels in the same group of patients. We measured serum BDNF levels in 47 patients with schizophrenia during a relapse and again 6 weeks after administration of antipsychotic treatment (14 on risperidone, 18 on haloperidol, 10 on olanzapine and five on amisulpride) and in 44 healthy volunteers. Patients with schizophrenia showed reduced serum BDNF levels in relation to healthy volunteers at study entry. No significant differences were revealed in BDNF serum levels after 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in the patients compared to their own levels at study entry. However, serum BDNF was significantly increased in the subgroup receiving olanzapine compared to the other antipsychotics. Our findings may indicate a differential effect of olanzapine on BDNF levels compared to haloperidol, risperidone, and amisulpride.",

Both carbocyclic and heterocyclic C2-aryl substituents have been studied ranging from single aryl rings to fused ring systems, and also styryl substituents, establishing across a library of 80 analogues that C2-aryl and styryl substituents significantly enhance both DNA-binding affinity and in vitro cytotoxicity, with a correlation between the two. The optimal C2-grouping for both DNA-binding affinity and cytotoxicity was found to be the C2-quinolinyl moiety which, according to molecular modeling, is due to the overall fit of the molecule in the DNA minor groove, and potential specific contacts with functional groups in the floor and walls of the groove.

Thus, several 'pain pathways' including high-voltage activated Ca2+ channels and the K(v)1 family of K+ channels ion channels appear related to the efficacy of pregabalin and amitryptyline, respectively, in FMS. Additionally, serotonergic and serotonergic/norepinephrine receptor-mediated mechanisms may explain the reported pharmacologic efficacy in FMS of mirtazapine, duloxetine and milnacipran. By contrast, the decreased level of micro-opioid receptors in the CNS of FMS patients suggests a mechanism as to why opioid therapy should be avoided. However, increased peripheral benzodiazepine receptors on monocytes from FMS patients suggested an explanation for the reported efficacy of olanzapine in FMS.",

Accurate and early prediction of mDDIs has become essential for drug research and development, and in vitro experiments designed to evaluate potential mDDIs are systematically included in the drug development plan prior to clinical assessment. The aim of this study was to illustrate the value and limitations of the classical and new approaches available to predict risks of DDIs in the research and development processes. The interaction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitors (ketoconazole and verapamil) with midazolam was predicted using the inhibitor concentration/inhibition constant ([I]/K(i)) approach, the static approach with added variability (Simcyp(R)), and whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (WB-PBPK) modelling (acslXtreme(R)). Then an in-house reference drug was used to challenge the different approaches based on the midazolam experience. Predicted values (pharmacokinetic parameters, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] ratio and plasma concentrations) were compared with observed values obtained after intravenous and oral administration in order to assess the accuracy of the prediction methods. With the [I]/K(i) approach, the interaction risk was always overpredicted for the midazolam substrate, regardless of its route of administration and the coadministered inhibitor. However, the predictions were always satisfactory (within 2-fold) for the reference drug. For the Simcyp(R) calculations, two of the three interaction results for midazolam were overpredicted, both when midazolam was given orally, whereas the prediction obtained when midazolam was administered intravenously was satisfactory. For the reference drug, all predictions could be considered satisfactory. For the WB-PBPK approach, all predictions were satisfactory, regardless of the substrate, route of administration, dose and coadministered inhibitor. DDI risk predictions are performed throughout the research and development processes and are now fully integrated into decision-making processes. The regulatory approach is useful to provide alerts, even at a very early stage of drug development. The 'steady state' approach in Simcyp(R) improves the prediction by using physiological knowledge and mechanistic assumptions. The DDI predictions are very useful, as they provide a range of AUC ratios that include individuals at the extremes of the population, in addition to the 'average tendency'. Finally, the WB-PBPK approach improves the predictions by simulating the concentration-time profiles and calculating the related pharmacokinetic parameters, taking into account the time of administration of each drug - but it requires a good understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of the compound.",

Differences in data-derived PD parameters were compared with relative incidence rates in the drug label (15.7% and 6.9%, respectively). Healthy volunteers (n = 20) received single oral doses of 2 mg lorazepam or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over fashion. A seven-point categorical scale measuring the intensity of AEs was serially administered over 24 h. The maximum score (MaxS), and area under the effect curve (AUEC) were determined by noncompartmental methods and compared using a paired t-test. Individual scores were modeled using a logistic function implemented in NONMEM. AUEC and MaxS for sleepiness were significantly higher than dizziness (20.35 vs. 9.76, p < 0.01) and (2.35 vs. 1.45, p < 0.01). Model slope estimates were similar for sleepiness and dizziness (0.21 logits x mL/ng vs. 0.19 logits x mL/ng), but baseline logits were significantly higher for sleepiness (-2.81 vs. -4.34 logits). Data-derived PD parameters were in concordance with label incidence rates.

According to the new legislation, the offender is sanctioned if Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol THC is >or=1.5ng/ml or amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), cocaine, free morphine are >or=15ng/ml in whole blood (confidence interval+/-30%). For all other psychoactive substances, impairment must be proven in applying the so-called \"three pillars expertise\". At the same time the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit for driving was lowered from 0.80 to 0.50g/kg. The purpose of this study was to analyze the prevalence of drugs in the first year after the introduction of the revision of the Swiss Traffic Law in the population of drivers suspected of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). A database was developed to collect the data from all DUID cases submitted by the police or the Justice to the eight Swiss authorized laboratories between January and December 2005. Data collected were anonymous and included the age, gender, date and time of the event, the type of vehicle, the circumstances, the sampling time and the results of all the performed toxicological analyses. The focus was explicitly on DUID; cases of drivers who were suspected to be under the influence of ethanol only were not considered. The final study population included 4794 DUID offenders (4243 males, 543 females). The mean age of all drivers was 31+/-12 years (range 14-92 years). One or more psychoactive drugs were detected in 89% of all analyzed blood samples. In 11% (N=530) of the samples, neither alcohol nor drugs were present. The most frequently encountered drugs in whole blood were cannabinoids (48% of total number of cases), ethanol (35%), cocaine (25%), opiates (10%), amphetamines (7%), benzodiazepines (6%) and methadone (5%). Other medicinal drugs such as antidepressants and benzodiazepine-like were detected less frequently. Poly-drug use was prevalent but it may be underestimated because the laboratories do not always analyze all drugs in a blood sample.

Using propensity score matching, matched cohorts of IM olanzapine- (N=2,984) and IM haloperidol-treated patients (N=2,984) and IM olanzapine- (N=2,876) and IM ziprasidone-treated patients (N=2,876) were obtained. The study outcome was in-hospital death within 2 days of administering IM antipsychotic. Incidence of death was not statistically different between olanzapine-ziprasidone cohorts (OR=1.21, 95% CI 0.92-1.59). The olanzapine cohort demonstrated a significantly lower death incidence than the haloperidol cohort (OR=0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.93; p=.011). The results suggest that patients treated with IM olanzapine do not have a significantly greater risk of death than patients treated with IM haloperidol or IM ziprasidone.", 
    "165": "Optimizing sustained use of ICU sedation in mechanically ventilated patients requires careful consideration of drug-specific characteristics (E.G. pharmacokinetics), consideration of potential adverse effects in susceptible patients, and utilization of sedation-minimizing strategies. In the era of anxiolytic dosing protocols adjusted to specific patient behaviors as defined by sedation scales in conjunction with daily interruption, midazolam is a reasonable option for long-term sedation. Propofol is an appealing agent for ICU sedation due to it's pharmacokinetic profile and a reduced propensity to result in prolonged sedation. However, care should be taken to monitor for potential devastating adverse effects including hypertriglyceridemia and propofol-related infusion syndrome (PRIS). Dexmedetomidine unreliably provides adequate sedation at doses currently approved by the FDA, though upward titration of dexmedetomidine coupled with rescue benzodiazepines and/or fentanyl appears to be safe and comparable to benzodiazepines in the achievement of light to moderate Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) goals. Clinicians should closely monitor patients receiving dexmedetomidine for hemodynamic-altering bradycardia. Strategies that promote frequent patient assessment with corresponding sedative dose minimization have demonstrated the benefits of limiting oversedation. Implementation of a sedation protocol requires careful consideration of ICU resources and staffing such that efforts made are sustainable and will be safe and effective for the patient population affected.", 
    "166": "The objective of the study was to estimate the frequency of recurrent falls and identify the main associated risk factors. The BRAZOS is the first epidemiological study performed on a representative sample of the Brazilian population. Anthropometric data, living habits, previous fractures, falls, dietary intake, physical activity and quality of life were evaluated in 2,420 individuals aged 40 and older. Recurrent falls were reported by 15.5% of men and 25.6% of women. Among women, the risk factors significantly associated to recurrent falls were age, previous fracture, sedentary lifestyle, poor quality of life, diabetes mellitus and current use of benzodiazepine. In men, the risk factors were age, poor quality of life, intake of alcoholic beverages, diabetes mellitus, previous fracture and use of benzodiazepine. A greater intake of vitamin D had a protector effect on the risk of recurrent falls. These findings demonstrated the high prevalence of recurrent falls and emphasize that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary to minimize recurrent falls and their consequences, including osteoporotic fractures.",

The wide variety of substances used for criminal purposes, their low concentrations in body fluids and, often, a long time delay between the event and clinical examination make comprehensive screening analysis of biological materials collected from crime victims for the presence of these drugs very difficult. Detection of a drug used to facilitate sexual assault in biological fluids can be very important evidence of a committed crime. The purpose of this study was to develop a simple GC-EI-MS screening procedure for date-rape drugs in urine. Target analytes were isolated by solid-phase extraction. 2-mL urine samples were extracted and then derivatized by using BSTFA+1%TMCS reagent. Detection of all compounds was based on full-scan mass spectra and for each compound one ion was chosen for further quantification. The method allowed the simultaneous screening, detection and quantification of 128 compounds from different groups (number of compounds): opioids (20), amphetamines (11), GHB and related products (3), hallucinogens (9), benzodiazepines (18), antihistamines (9), antidepressants (14), selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (4), antipsychotics (7), barbiturates (7), other sedatives (5), muscle relaxants (2) and other drugs (19). The procedure can easily be expanded to encompass more substances. The developed method appeared to be suitable for screening for the target DRDs. The procedure was successfully applied to the analysis of authentic urine samples collected from victims of rapes and other crimes in routine casework.",

Very few studies have been made in children about the hypnotics that are most widely used in adult patients: zopiclone, zolpidem and the hypnotic benzodiazepines. However, melatonin has recently become the most studied hypnotic drug in children since the marketing of a sustained-released form gave it the status of a drug and improved its pharmacokinetic properties.

    "181": "Low back pain is one of the most common conditions encountered in clinical practice and medications are the most commonly used type of treatment. In most patients, low back pain is nonspecific, in that the pain cannot be reliably attributed to a specific condition or abnormality in the back. Although a number of medications are available to treat nonspecific low back pain, selecting a therapy can be a challenge because each one is associated with a unique set of benefits and harms. In addition, the evidence supporting the use of different medications varies, and issues such as costs and patient preferences may also affect treatment choices. A guideline published in 2007 from the American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians on diagnosis and treatment of low back pain includes recommendations on the use of medications, based on the quality of supporting evidence and the estimated magnitude of benefits relative to harms. For most patients with low back pain, regardless of the duration of symptoms, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs are first-line options for pain relief. Opioids are more potent analgesics, but are not a first-line option due to their abuse potential. Skeletal muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines can be used as adjunctive medications for acute low back pain, but have a high incidence of sedation. Tricyclic antidepressants may be an option for chronic low back pain, but their effects on pain appear small or uncertain. Nonetheless, depression is common in patients with low back pain and should be treated appropriately. When choosing medications for treatment of low back pain, practice guidelines provide a useful starting point for making decisions, but clinicians should base therapeutic choices on individualized consideration and discussion with patients regarding the potential benefits and risks.",

Mean weight gain was 0.9 kg with asenapine, 4.2 kg with olanzapine. Extrapyramidal symptoms reported as adverse events were more common with asenapine. Mean reductions in PANSS total score with asenapine and olanzapine were -21.0 and -27.5 ( P<0.0001); the exclusion of patients who had previous poor experience with olanzapine may have biased the results in favor of olanzapine.

    "186": "This study aims to establish the antiproliferative effects of PK11195, a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (PBR) in rat mammary tumor cells. Breast tumors were induced by administration of a carcinogen, dimethylbenz[a]anthracene to 50-day-old female rats maintained on a standard AIN-76A diet with casein as the protein source. The tumors were developed approximately after 120 days. The tumors were of grade I (20%), grade II (60%), and grade III (20%). The tumors were isolated and cultured in DMEM/F12 media with supplements. We characterized the properties of the isolated cells and study the effect of PK11195 on those cells. We were successful in growing breast tumor cells up to 30 passages for cellular characterization. These cells had high reactivity with Ki-67 and PCNA antibodies suggesting high proliferation rate. These cells were highly invasive as evident by matrigel invading ability. Furthermore, these cells acquired a positive response for CD-31 and VEGF antibodies suggesting angiogenic potential, and also possessed migrating ability/motility as evident by the wound healing properties. These cells expressed elevated levels of PBR, a cancer promoting gene. The proliferation, invasion and migration appear to decrease when treated with PK11195, a PBR antagonist. Furthermore, PK11195 treatment caused an increase in apoptosis as evident by increase in the levels of annexin V. However, the inhibition of cell proliferation by PK11195 was counteracted by Ro5-4864, a PBR agonist. Thus, PBR antagonist may be a potential therapeutic agent for the control of aggressiveness of breast cancer.", 
    "187": "A simple and fast microwave-assisted-extraction (MAE) method has been evaluated as an alternative to solid-phase extraction (SPE) for the determination of six benzodiazepines widely prescribed in European countries (alprazolam, bromazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, lormetazepam and tetrazepam) in human plasma. For MAE optimization a Doehlert experimental design was used with extraction time, temperature and solvent volume as influential parameters. A desirability function was employed in addition to the simultaneous optimization of the MAE conditions. The analysis of variance showed that the solvent volume had a positive influence on the extraction of all the analytes tested, achieving a statistically significant effect. Also, the extraction time had a statistically significant effect on the extraction of four benzodiazepines. The selected MAE conditions-89 degrees C, 13 min and 8 mL of chloroform/2-propanol (4:1, v/v)-led to recoveries between 89.8 +/- 0.3 and 102.1 +/- 5.2% for benzodiazepines using a high performance liquid chromatography method coupled with diode-array detection. The comparison of MAE and SPE shows better results for MAE, with a lower number of steps in handling the sample and greater efficiency.

The discordance between urine and meconium could be explained by the differences in detection window, threshold concentration and screening technology, and the discordance between dizygotic twin meconium samples could be explained by the differences in drug diffusion and placental and fetal biotransformation of drugs. The meconium sample of one twin screened negative for benzodiazepines was reported positive in the confirmation assay with higher sensitivity and a lower cut-off concentration. Negative screening results of drugs of abuse should be interpreted with caution, taking into account matrix type, reactivity of drugs in the assay and cut-off concentration. If screening results are inconsistent with each other or with the clinical scenario, confirmation testing using more sensitive and specific methods with lower cut-offs is warranted.", 
    "190": "Understanding the potential for cytochrome P450-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is a critical step in the drug discovery process. DDIs of CYP3A4 are of particular importance because of the number of marketed drugs that are cleared by this enzyme. In response to studies that suggested the presence of several binding regions within the CYP3A4 active site, multiple probe substrates are often used for in vitro CYP3A4 DDI studies, including midazolam (the clinical standard), felodipine/nifedipine, and testosterone. However, the design of clinical CYP3A4 DDI studies may be confounded for cases such as 1-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl)-N-[5-(7-methoxyquinolin-4-yloxy)pyridin-2-yl]-5-methyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide (AMG 458), with which testosterone is predicted to exhibit a clinically relevant DDI whereas midazolam and felodipine/nifedipine are not. To develop an appropriate path forward for such clinical DDI studies, the inhibition potency of 20 known inhibitors of CYP3A4 were measured in vitro using 8 clinically relevant CYP3A4 probe substrates and testosterone. Hierarchical clustering suggested four probe substrate clusters: testosterone; felodipine; midazolam, buspirone, quinidine, and sildenafil; and simvastatin, budesonide, and fluticasone. The in vivo sensitivities of six clinically relevant CYP3A4 probe substrates (buspirone, cyclosporine, nifedipine, quinidine, sildenafil, and simvastatin) were determined in relation to midazolam from literature DDI data. Buspirone, sildenafil, and simvastatin exhibited similar or greater sensitivity than midazolam to CYP3A4 inhibition in vivo. Finally, Simcyp was used to predict the in vivo magnitude of CYP3A4 DDIs caused by AMG 458 using midazolam, sildenafil, simvastatin, and testosterone as probe substrates.", 
    "191": "Effectiveness has become more and more important as a comprehensive outcome measure for (long-term) treatment in schizophrenia. Early predictors to identify patients at a high risk for not succeeding the initiated treatment would be very useful. Discontinuation of the initiated treatment was used as criterion for effectiveness and patients' drug attitude was shown to be predictive for non-adherence or discontinuation of long-term treatment in schizophrenia. Accordingly, the predictive validity of the Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) for effectiveness should be evaluated. Based on a sub-sample of patients from the EUFEST study for whom DAI assessments were available significant predictors for effectiveness as measured by discontinuation of initiated treatment were identified based on a logistic and a Cox-regression analysis. A Receiver-Operating Characteristic- (ROC-) analysis was conducted for the DAI, prognostic / diagnostic parameters (sensitivity, specificity) were calculated and a cut-off value suggested. In a sample of 228 first-episode patients, the DAI score was the most powerful predictor for effectiveness (p<0.001) besides two other significant predictors (PANSS-positive score and sexual side effects). The ROC-analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.64 (p<0.001). The suggested cut-off point of about 20 yielded a sensitivity of 70-75% and a specificity of 40-45%. Study results indicate that the Drug Attitude Inventory, filled in by patients early in treatment seems to be a valid predictor for effectiveness as measured by discontinuation of the initiated treatment. DAI scores could also serve as an (differential) indicator for the need of enhanced treatment monitoring. These findings have to be validated in other (first-episode) samples.",

Treatment with benzodiazepines failed; lorazepam therapy obscured our ability to do reliable neurological testing to follow his brain injury and nearly resulted in intubation of the patient secondary to respiratory suppression. Upon admission to hospital, the patient was first treated with intermittent, prophylactic doses of lorazepam for potential alcohol withdrawal based upon our institution's standard of care. His neurological examinations including a motor score of 6 (obeying commands) on his Glasgow Coma Scale testing, laboratory studies, and repeat CT head imaging remained stable. For lack of published literature in diagnosing symptoms of patients with a history of both alcohol withdrawal and traumatic brain injury, a diagnosis of agitation secondary to presumed alcohol withdrawal was made when the patient developed acute onset of tachycardia, confusion, and extreme anxiety with tremor and attempts to climb out of bed requiring him to be restrained. Additional lorazepam doses were administered following a hospital-approved protocol for titration of benzodiazepine therapy for alcohol withdrawal. The patient's mental status and respiratory function deteriorated with the frequent lorazepam dosing needed to control his agitation. Dexmedetomidine IV infusion at a rate of 0.5 mcg/kg/h was then administered and was titrated ultimately to 1.5 mcg/kg/h. After 8 days of therapy with dexmedetomidine, the patient was transferred from the ICU to a step-down unit with an intact neurological examination and no evidence of alcohol withdrawal.

Its use should be monitored carefully over time as RBD appears to be a precursor to neurodegenerative disorders with dementia in some patients. Level B Clonazepam is suggested to decrease the occurrence of sleep-related injury caused by RBD in patients for whom pharmacologic therapy is deemed necessary. It should be used in caution in patients with dementia, gait disorders, or concomitant OSA, and its use should be monitored carefully over time. Level B Melatonin is suggested for the treatment of RBD with the advantage that there are few side effects. Level B Pramipexole may be considered to treat RBD, but efficacy studies have shown contradictory results. There is little evidence to support the use of paroxetine or L-DOPA to treat RBD, and some studies have suggested that these drugs may actually induce or exacerbate RBD. There are limited data regarding the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, but they may be considered to treat RBD in patients with a concomitant synucleinopathy. Level C.", 
    "213": "General and practical training, knowing of safe methods of preanesthesia, pain and anxiety control and establishing a good relation with the patient are some of the most important methods of patient management in the dental office. The final goals of the methods are to obtain a calm patient, haemodinamic equilibrated and safely prepared for the surgery.", 
    "214": "Our study was performed on 448 patients. Different methods of preanesthesia were used by administrating per oral, intravenous, intramuscular, according with DAS score: Midazolam, Diazepam + Algocalmin, Xanax.", 
    "215": "58% of our patients declared after surgery that their satisfaction score is 100% positive after one of our methods of preanesthesia.", 
    "216": "When choosing the appropiate premedication, the ability of the analgesic and anxiolytic drug to improve pain tolerance should be one of the most important criteria. Doses must be correlated with the anxiety score DAS, road use and the probable duration of surgery.", 
    "217": "The authors present the result of an observational study about the withdrawal syndrome in benzodiazepine dependence, and the aspect of identifying withdrawal symptoms, effective communication with the patient and the structure of withdrawal programmes.", 
    "218": "The study included a number of 22 pacients hospitalised in the Drug-Dependence Clinic of Ia\u015fi between January 2006 - December 2008.", 
    "219": "The present article consists of data covering current issues in the area of withdrawal syndrome in benzodiazepine dependence. The most prescribed benzodiazepines were diazepam (10 cases), followed by alprazolam (5 cases) and nitrazepam (4 cases). The clinical manifestations such as anxiety, insomnia, concentration problems, fatigability were present at all patients.", 
    "220": "There are reports that suggest that magnesium sulphate alone may control muscle spasms thereby avoiding sedation and mechanical ventilation in tetanus, but this has not been confirmed. We examined the efficacy and safety of intravenous magnesium sulphate for control of rigidity and spasms in adults with tetanus. A prospective clinical study of intravenous magnesium sulphate was carried out over a period of two years in a tertiary care teaching hospital. In addition to human tetanus immunoglobulin and parenteral antibiotics, patients with tetanus received magnesium sulphate 70 mg/kg intravenously followed by infusion. The infusion was increased by 0.5 g/hour every six hours until cessation of spasms or abolishment of patellar tendon jerk. The primary outcome measure was efficacy determined by control of spasms. Secondary outcomes included frequency of autonomic instability, duration of ventilatory support, hospital stay and mortality. Thirty-three patients were enrolled. At presentation, the incidence of severity of tetanus was as follows: Grade I: 5 (15%), Grade II: 13 (39%), Grade III: 14 (42%) and Grade IV: 1 (3%). Rigidity and mild spasms were controlled with magnesium therapy alone in six patients; all were Grades I or II. Additional sedatives were required in severe forms of tetanus. The average duration of ventilatory support was 18.3 +/- 16.0 days and the overall mortality was 22.9%. Asymptomatic hypocalcaemia was a universal finding. Magnesium sulphate therapy alone may not be efficacious for the treatment of severe tetanus.", 
    "221": "Ventilated patients receiving opioids and/or benzodiazepines are at high risk of developing agitation, particularly upon weaning towards extubation. This is often associated with an increased intubation time and length of stay in the intensive care unit and may cause long-term morbidity. Anxiety, fear and agitation are amongst the most common non-pulmonary causes of failure to liberate from mechanical ventilation. This prospective, open-label observational study examined 28 ventilated adult patients in the intensive care unit (30 episodes) requiring opioids and/or sedatives for >24 hours, who developed agitation and/or delirium upon weaning from sedation and failed to achieve successful extubation with conventional management. Patients were ventilated for a median (interquartile range) of 115 [87 to 263] hours prior to enrolment. Dexmedetomidine infusion was commenced at 0.4 microg/kg/hour for two hours, after which concurrent sedative therapy was preferentially weaned and titrated to obtain target Motor Activity Assessment Score score of 2 to 4. The median (range) maximum dose and infusion time of dexmedetomidine was 0.7 microg/kg/hour (0.4 to 1.0) and 62 hours (24 to 252) respectively. The number of episodes at target Motor Activity Assessment Score score at zero, six and 12 hours after commencement of dexmedetomidine were 7/30 (23.3%), 28/30 (93.3%) and 26/30 (86.7%), respectively (P < 0.001 for 6 and 12 vs. 0 hours). Excluding unrelated clinical deterioration, 22 episodes (73.3%) achieved successful weaning from ventilation with a median (interquartile range) ventilation time of 70 (28 to 96) hours after dexmedetomidine infusion. Dexmedetomidine achieved rapid resolution of agitation and facilitated ventilatory weaning after failure of conventional therapy. Its role as first-line therapy in ventilated, agitated patients warrants further investigation."
