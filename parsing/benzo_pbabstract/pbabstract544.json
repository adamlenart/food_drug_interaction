    "0": "Two experiments were conducted on the acute and chronic effects of the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam on fixed ratio schedule-maintained operant responding in rats. Acute administration of midazolam produced suppression of responding in large doses but elevation of responding in small doses. Following intermittent (every third day) chronic treatment tolerance developed rapidly to the rate-suppressant effects of large doses of midazolam but did not develop to the rate-elevating effects of small doses, even after chronic treatment with large doses of the drug. Thus, when tolerance was measured in terms of shifts in dose-effect curves, it was manifested as a non-parallel shift in the curve after chronic treatment. Since tolerance developed to the effects of large but not small doses, the observed tolerance could not be attributed to changes in disposition of the drug. The development of tolerance did not depend on whether the drug was given before or after behavioural testing. These findings contrast with data reported in behavioural studies with other sedative-hypnotics (ethanol, barbiturates). Animals tolerant to midazolam showed no cross-tolerance to ethanol, a drug for which there is reliable evidence indicating that behavioural factors play a role in acquisition of tolerance. Tolerance to midazolam cannot therefore be explained in terms of learned strategies acquired as a result of drug-induced loss of rewarding stimuli. This conclusion contrasts with recent suggestions (File, 1985; File and Pellow, 1985) that tolerance to benzodiazepines may be mediated by instrumental conditioning processes.", 
    "1": "A two-compartment activity box is described in which the actions of anxiolytic compounds may be readily detected. The box is designed with a partition which divides a dimly-lit black area and a brightly-illuminated white area. Free access to each section is enabled by means of a small opening in the partition. Measures of locomotion and rearing are recorded as well as transitions from black to white and vice versa. Time spent in each section is also measured. In this situation mice demonstrated a clear preference for the dim black section, a finding not inconsistent with the nocturnal nature of this species. By contrast, treatment with diazepam (0.125-5 mg/kg) or triazolam (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in activity in the white section. Locomotion and rearing in the black section showed a corresponding decrease. Sulpiride (0.5-20 mg/kg) and tiapride (0.5-40 mg/kg) had similar effects. These actions would appear to be independent of their effects on general activity, as amphetamine (1.25-2.5 mg/kg) increased and haloperidol (0.05-0.2 mg/kg) decreased overall exploratory behaviour in a non-selective manner. These data suggest the \"two-compartment activity box\" to be a model sensitive to the actions of clinically-active anxiolytics.", 
    "2": "The relation between free serum and saliva concentrations of nitrazepam in healthy male volunteers has been studied. It was found that the average value of free serum concentrations from all volunteers was twice the average value of corresponding saliva concentrations. Sometimes mean values of serum, free serum and saliva concentrations are used in correlation studies. However, the data from individual volunteers showed that there was no correlation between them. Statistics can easily introduce false pictures for correlations between free serum and saliva concentrations of nitrazepam, whereas no correlation could be found on the basis of results from individuals. In response studies such as the effects of drugs on driving performance, the free serum and saliva concentrations of a drug from individual volunteers should therefore be considered. This will complicate the use of saliva in epidemiological studies on drugs and driving.", 
    "3": "Several lines of evidence suggest that the convulsant actions of caffeine are mediated through benzodiazepine receptors. A pharmacogenetic approach has been used to further explore the relationship of these receptors to caffeine-induced seizures. The susceptibility of two inbred strains of mice (CBA and SWR) to the convulsant actions of picrotoxinin, strychnine, Ro 5-4864 and DMCM was examined. Previous studies have demonstrated these two strains differ in their susceptibilities to the convulsant action of caffeine. While no differences were observed between these two strains in susceptibility to tonic seizures induced by picrotoxinin, RO 5-4864 or strychnine, SWR mice were significantly less sensitive to tonic seizures induced by DMCM compared to CBA mice (CD50 values in CBA and SWR mice were 6 and 12 mg/kg IP). Both clonazepam and the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788, significantly blocked caffeine-induced seizures. Further, when subconvulsant doses of caffeine and DMCM were combined, a synergistic action was observed. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that the convulsant actions of caffeine result from an action at benzodiazepine receptors, and that the hyporesponsiveness of the SWR strain to both caffeine- and DMCM-induced seizures could result from an inherited abnormality in these sites.", 
    "4": "The effect of diazepam on the acetylcholine (ACh) synthesizing system has been studied in mouse brain in vivo. ACh and choline (Ch) were analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry using deuterated internal standards. Turnover of ACh was studied by following the incorporation of Ch into ACh after an intravenous injection of [2H6]-Ch. The mice were killed by focussed microwave irradiation on the head. Diazepam was found to increase the endogenous level of Ch, while the concentration of [2H6]-Ch was only half of that of the controls. The incorporation of [2H6]-Ch into [2H6]-ACh was decreased, while the endogenous level of ACh was slightly increased. The turnover rate of ACh was decreased, consistent with a decrease in neuronal excitability induced by diazepam. The elevated endogenous Ch-level and the lower concentration of [2H6]-Ch in the brain, might be explained by an effect of diazepam on the Ch-transport across the blood-brain barrier. This theory is supported by experiments where levels of endogenous and [2H6]-labelled Ch were analyzed in blood following an intravenous injection of [2H6]-Ch. The [2H6]-Ch was found to be eliminated faster in blood from diazepam treated mice. The increased blood level of endogenous Ch, induced by the [2H6]-Ch injection also returned more rapidly to normal in these animals. This is consistent with peripheral Ch being eliminated faster when the central Ch supply is decreased.", 
    "5": "A new antibiotic, abbeymycin, has been isolated from Streptomyces sp. AB-999F-52. The structure of abbeymycin was assigned on the basis of NMR, mass spectrometric and UV spectral data. Abbeymycin has weak activity against a limited number of anaerobic bacteria.", 
    "6": "The action of the tranquilizer diazepam on rat skeletal muscle showed that relaxation of isometric twitches is controlled by different processes in extensor digitorum longus (fast-twitch) and soleus (slow-twitch) muscles. Diazepam caused an increase in the amplitude of twitches in fibres from both muscles but increased the twitch duration only in soleus. The amplitude of fused tetani were reduced in both muscles and the rate of relaxation after the tetanus slowed by as much as 34% when the amplitude of the tetanus was reduced by only 11%. The slower tetanic relaxation indicated that calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum was slower than normal in slow- and fast-twitch fibres. We conclude therefore that calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is rate limiting for twitch relaxation in slow-twitch but not fast-twitch fibres and suggest that calcium binding to parvalbumin controls relaxation in the fast fibres.", 
    "7": "Since no information is available concerning the action of pirenzepine in vivo on human tracheobronchial tree, we evaluated the respiratory responses to pirenzepine in a group of healthy subjects. This clinical study suggests that pirenzepine exerts its bronchodilatory action on small airways (from 9th generation to distal airways), but not on larger airways, in normal subjects. These results are consistent with a probable presence of muscarinic high affinity receptors (M1 subtype) only in peripheral airways.", 
    "8": "Evidence for the role of essential fatty acids in alcohol dependence is reviewed. If alcohol-induced tissue damage is associated with impaired fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism, supplements of essential fatty acids might be beneficial in the treatment of alcoholics. The evidence for this effect is examined.", 
    "9": "The structure of gastrozepin (G) resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants and antihistaminic and antiserotonic cyproheptadine which are compounds with known metabolic effects. The object of this study was to test the potential action of G on the metabolism of basic nutrients, insulin and selected hormonal parameters after parenteral administration (10 and 20 mg G) and after chronic oral administration (50 mg G) during antiulcer therapy. Investigations carried out in two groups of 7 and 9 healthy volunteers, respectively, and on one group of seven patients with ulcer disease, revealed no changes in any of the blood parameters studied, nor in the excretion of catecholamines or 17-OH steroids in the urine. Our observations practically rule out any metabotropic activity of G, thereby differentiating it from tricyclic antidepressants and cyproheptadine. Isolated significant differences from the basal value seen after G and saline, can be attributed to other than pharmacological or specific mechanisms such as stress associated with the first examination, effect of fasting, individual response of the subjects, and so on.", 
    "10": "Early dropouts from a double-blind comparison of the therapeutic efficacy of alprazolam and imipramine were examined. The dropout rate across the total sample of 99 analyzable outpatients with major depression was 3 times higher in the imipramine treatment group. Although essentially all patients met DSM-III criteria for major depressive episode, only two thirds of the total sample met the restrictive Feighner criteria for primary depressive disorder. Early termination in the imipramine group was concentrated in the group of depressed outpatients who failed to satisfy the Feighner criteria. Implications of these and other recently reported results for choice of drug treatment for depressed psychiatric outpatients are discussed.", 
    "11": "The diagnosis, epidemiology, classification and clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment of anxiety disorders are reviewed. Anxiety disorders, among the most common mental disorders, must be differentiated from medical diseases with anxious symptoms. A complete physical and mental status examination, as well as a thorough knowledge of the patient's medical, psychiatric, and drug history are required. Epidemiologic studies indicate an incidence of 4-8% in the United States. There are four categories of anxiety disorders: phobic disorders, anxiety states, posttraumatic stress disorders, and atypical anxiety disorders. Several psychoanalytic, behavioral, and cognitive theories have been advanced to explain the pathophysiologic mechanisms causing anxiety disorders. Of most interest are the biological theories involving the catecholamine neurotransmitter norepinephrine and the benzodiazepine receptor. Proper treatment for anxiety disorders involves nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches. The benzodiazepines are widely used and are the mainstay of drug treatment for patients with situational anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder. However, problems with sedation, complications of drug withdrawal, and patients' fear of drug dependency may limit clinical usefulness. Buspirone is the first nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic to be introduced in the United States in more than 25 years. Its unique role in treating anxiety, compared with the benzodiazepines, may include less sedation, minimal drug abuse potential, and fewer withdrawal symptoms upon drug discontinuation. Nonpharmacologic therapy is used extensively in the treatment of phobic disorders (simple and social phobia). Important advances in the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders have been made. An accurate diagnosis is essential for optimal management. Unfortunately, many anxious patients do not seek treatment and some do not receive the most appropriate treatment.", 
    "12": "The Alzheimer type II astrocyte change is the distinctive morphologic alteration in brain of humans and experimental animals succumbing to hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Whether this change is a primary event in the pathogenesis of HE or whether it is secondary to injury of some other component(s) of the CNS has not been clarified. Studies in a rat model of HE have revealed early reactive changes in astrocytes characterized by cytoplasmic hypertrophy. During the later phases, degenerative changes ensue corresponding to the Alzheimer type II change observed by light microscopy. In view of the role of astrocytes in ammonia detoxification and the importance of ammonia in the pathogenesis of HE, we have suggested that the initial astrocytic changes are the morphological correlates of ammonia detoxification. We have speculated that the later degenerative alterations could lead to failure by astrocytes to carry out key functions (e.g., neurotransmitter uptake, ion regulation, and the like) and contribute the development of the encephalopathy. Recently, the potential involvement of astrocytes in HE has been further investigated, using primary astrocyte cultures. Exposure of cultures to ammonia at clinically relevant concentrations has shown morphologic changes closely resembling those observed in experimental HE in vivo. These deleterious effects can partly be prevented by raising cyclic AMP levels in cells. Other potential toxins (octanoic acid, phenol) have shown pathologic changes as well. Although some alterations were common to all three, they each possessed distinctive pathological effects. A synergistic interaction has also been demonstrated with these toxins. Functional studies of ammonia-treated astrocytes have shown the following: With low doses or short-term exposure, the uptakes of K+, glutamate, and GABA remained unchanged or slightly increased, whereas with higher doses or longer treatment, those activities diminished. A fall in ATP values occurred with prolonged ammonia treatment. Preliminary findings have shown no significant derangements in the beta-adrenergic receptor, except for a slight decrease in receptor affinity. However, cyclic AMP production was diminished following stimulation with isoproterenol. A slight rise in the number of benzodiazepine receptors was found. These studies indicate that profound changes occur in astrocytes following exposure to ammonia and other putative toxins. It is proposed that toxins and factors involved in the precipitation of HE do so by affecting astroglial properties. Derangements in such properties may lead to glial dysfunction (primary gliopathy), resulting in an encephalopathic state.", 
    "13": "Morphine hydrochloride (25-200 nmol), [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin (10-200 nmol) and naloxone hydrochloride (100-1000 nmol) were injected unilaterally into the rat amygdala and the following electrographic, behavioural and neuropathological responses were studied. Microinjections of low doses of morphine (25-50 nmol) resulted in behavioural alterations characterized by staring, gustatory automatisms and wet shakes, whereas higher doses additionally produced motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus. The first changes in the electroencephalogram appeared in the amygdala immediately after the administration of morphine and rapidly spread to hippocampal and cortical areas. Electrographic alterations consisted of high voltage fast activity, spiking, bursts of polyspiking, electrographic seizures and periods of postictal depression. Neuropathological analysis of frontal forebrain sections by means of light microscopy revealed widespread, seizure-related damage confined to amygdala, olfactory cortex, thalamus, hippocampal formation, neocortex and substantia nigra. Pretreatment of animals with naloxone, 2-20 mg/kg s.c., as well as simultaneous microinjection of the non-convulsant dose of naloxone, 100 nmol, with morphine, 100 nmol, into the amygdala failed to block the development of convulsant activity and seizure-related brain damage produced by the opiate. In contrast, diazepam, 10 mg/kg i.p., when administered prior to the microinjection of morphine into the amygdala, abolished the epileptogenic effects of the drug. [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]Enkephalin, 10-200 nmol, elicited electrographic and behavioural responses similar to those seen after low doses of morphine, when administered into the amygdala. High voltage fast activity, single spikes, bursts of polyspiking, electrographic seizures and periods of postictal depression were seen in the electroencephalogram, but no behavioural signs of motor limbic seizures could be detected. The only behavioural correlates of epileptiform electrographic activity were wet shakes, myoclonic head twiches and gustatory automatisms. The examination of frontal forebrain sections from rats receiving [D-Ala2, D-Leu5]enkephalin revealed no morphological changes. Pretreatment of rats with either naloxone, 2 mg/kg, or diazepam, 10 mg/kg, blocked the development of behavioural and electrographic sequelae of the peptide. Naloxone, 100-1000 nmol, when microinjected into the amygdala, produced electrographic, behavioural and morphological alterations resembling those seen after high doses of morphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Modulation of the benzodiazepine receptor/GABA receptor/chloride ionophore complex in vivo involves a number of intricate regulatory interactions between the three components of the receptor complex. One way to assess these potential interactions involves the in vivo labelling of the benzodiazepine receptor with [3H]flunitrazepam. In these studies, we used this approach to demonstrate that the neuroleptic, clozapine, increases [3H]flunitrazepam binding in mouse brain in a bicuculline-reversible manner. This potentiation of benzodiazepine binding was not antagonized by picrotoxin and was found to result from a slower dissociation of [3H]flunitrazepam from the benzodiazepine receptor. These data suggest that clozapine acts to increase [3H]flunitrazepam binding via a GABAergic mechanism, independent of the chloride channel.", 
    "15": "Various benzodiazepines (BZs) were investigated for their analgesic effect by the tail-flick method in mice. Central type BZ-receptor agonists such as clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam showed analgesia while the peripheral BZ-receptor binding agent, Ro 5-4864, and the BZ micromolar binding agent phenytoin, failed to show any effect. Other BZs, such as lorazepam and nitrazepam, were ineffective in producing analgesia. Pretreatment with naloxone antagonized the analgesic effect of central type BZ-receptor agonists. Similarly, pretreatment with Ro 15-1788, a central BZ-receptor antagonist, also blocked the analgesic effect. When the involvement of the GABAergic system in the analgesic response of BZ agonists was investigated, a potentiation of BZ action was seen as a combination of a subeffective dose of clonazepam with a subanalgesic dose of muscimol, a specific GABAA agonist, showed an enhanced effect. Moreover, pretreatment with GABAergic substances like pentobarbitone also showed a facilitatory effect on BZ-induced analgesia. On the other hand, a combination of clonazepam with baclofen, a specific GABAB agonist, failed to show any synergistic effect. The analgesic effect of central type BZ-receptor agonists was found to be bicuculline reversible. It is concluded that GABAA receptor activation has a modulatory role in the naloxone sensitive analgesic effect of central type BZ-receptor agonists.", 
    "16": "Chlordimeform (N'(4-chloro-o-tolyl)-N, N-dimethylformamidine; CDM) is a formamidine insecticide acaricide whose major active metabolite is its N-monomethyl analog, desmethylchlordimeform, (DCDM). While their pesticidal action in invertebrates appears to be related to activation of octopamine receptors, their mechanism of action in mammals has not been established. Because of similarities between octopamine and adrenergic receptors and suggestions of CDM and DCDM action on adrenoceptors, the in vitro interactions of CDM and DCDM with adrenoceptors were studied. In mouse brain membrane preparations CDM inhibited the binding of [3H]-clonidine to alpha 2- adrenoceptors and of [3H]-WB4101 to alpha 1-adrenoceptors with IC50 values of 18.2 and 87 microM, respectively. DCDM was a much more potent inhibitor, with IC50 values toward alpha 2-, and alpha 1-adrenoceptors of 44 nM and 1 microM, respectively. Both compounds were only weak inhibitors of the binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol to beta-adrenoceptors and of [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate to muscarinic receptors and were inactive toward benzodiazepines and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors. Inhibition of [3H]-clonidine binding by both compounds was competitive, as indicated by a decreased receptor affinity without changes in receptor density. Interaction of CDM and DCDM with [3H]-WB4101 binding, on the other hand, was more complex, and not of the competitive type. These results show that CDM and its metabolite DCDM can interact directly in vitro with alpha-adrenergic receptors, suggesting that these receptors could mediate some of the effects of CDM and DCDM in vivo.", 
    "17": "Water-deprived male rats were adapted to a 30 min test of water or saline drinking in a single-bottle acceptance test. The potent benzodiazepine agonist, clonazepam, produced significant increases in both water and saline consumption. Increases in the consumption of both were also obtained with the non-benzodiazepine agonist, zopiclone (a cyclopyrrolone), but not with the pyrazoloquinoline agonist, CGS 9896. Hence, some, but not all, benzodiazepine receptor agonists enhance drinking responses. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, Ro15-1788 and CGS 8216, had no significant effect on the intake of either isotonic saline or water. In contrast, the beta-carboline FG 7142, which has been described as an inverse agonist acting at benzodiazepine receptors, reduced both saline and water drinking at 10 and 20 mg/kg. Although the baseline level of saline drinking was considerably higher than that of water, there was no general indication that any drug effect on consumption interacted with the type of fluid in the drinking test. However, in the case of agonist-induced increases in consumption, peak effects occurred at different doses; they were lower for saline- than for water-drinking.", 
    "18": "Radioligand binding displacement studies were conducted to determine the effects of Type I and II pyrethroids on [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU), [3H]muscimol (MUS), and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding. Competition experiments with [3H]FLU and [3H]MUS indicate a lack of competition for binding by the pyrethroids. Type I pyrethroids failed to compete for the binding of [35S]TBPS at concentrations as high as 50 microM. Type II pyrethroids inhibited [35S]TBPS binding to rat brain synaptosomes with Ki values ranging from 5-10 microM. The data presented here suggest that the interaction of Type II pyrethroids with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-ionophore complex is restricted to a site near the TBPS/picrotoxinin binding site.", 
    "19": "4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-(5,4-c-)pyridin-3-ol (THIP) in concentrations of 100-500 microM inhibited 3H-flunitrazepam (3H FNZ) binding to intact membranes at 0 degrees C in 25 mM TRIS-HCl buffer. The inhibition of 3H FNZ binding was due to the decrease in the affinity and Bmax of 3H FNZ binding. The affinity for benzodiazepines (e.g. BZ-receptor agonists) was reduced in the presence of THIP, whereas the affinity for BZ-receptor antagonists was unchanged. The value of THIP-induced shift was dependent on the molarity of TRIS-HCl buffer and the concentration of THIP. The results obtained suggest that THIP-induced shifts have a predictive value in the determination of pharmacological efficacy of BZ-receptor ligands.", 
    "20": "Two types of benzodiazepine receptors have been demonstrated in mammalian tissues, one which is localized on neuronal elements in brain and the other, on glial cells and in peripheral tissues such as kidney. In vivo administration of 3H-labeled PK 11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide] or [3H]flunitrazepam with 5 mg of clonazepam per kg to rats with intracranial C6 gliomas resulted in high levels of tritiated-drug binding to the tumor as shown by quantitative autoradiography. Pharmacological studies indicated that the bound drugs labeled the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site. Binding to the peripheral benzodiazepine site was confirmed primarily to malignant cells with little binding to adjacent normal brain tissue or to necrotic tissue. Tumor cell binding was completely inhibited by preadministration of the peripheral benzodiazepine blocking agent PK 11195 at 5 mg/kg. The centrally selective benzodiazepine ligand clonazepam had no effect on PK 11195 binding to the tumor cells. When binding to other tumor cell lines grown in nude mice and nude athymic rats was evaluated, little or no peripheral benzodiazepine binding was detected on human pheochromocytoma (RN1) and neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC, SK-N-SH) tumor cells, respectively. However, high densities of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites were observed on tumors derived from a human glioma cell line (ATCC HTB 14, U-87 MG). The presence of high concentrations of specific peripheral benzodiazepine receptors on glial tumors suggests that human primary central nervous system tumors could be imaged and diagnosed using peripheral benzodiazepine ligands labeled with positron- or gamma-emitting isotopes.", 
    "21": "We have recently shown that an arylaminopyridazine derivative of GABA, SR 95103 [2-(3-carboxypropyl)-3-amino-4-methyl-6-phenylpyridazinium chloride], is a selective and competitive GABA-A receptor antagonist. In order to further explore the structural requirements for GABA receptor affinity, we synthesized a series of 38 compounds by attaching various pyridazinic structures to GABA or GABA-like side chains. Most of the compounds displaced [3H]GABA from rat brain membranes. All the active compounds antagonized the GABA-elicited enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding, strongly suggesting that all these compounds are GABA-A receptor antagonists. None of the compounds that displaced [3H]GABA from rat brain membranes interacted with other GABA recognition sites (GABA-B receptor, GABA uptake binding site, glutamate decarboxylase, GABA-transaminase). They did not interact with the Cl- ionophore associated with the GABA-A receptor and did not interact with the benzodiazepine, strychnine, and glutamate binding sites. Thus, these compounds appear to be specific GABA-A receptor antagonists. In terms of structure-activity, it can be concluded that a GABA moiety bearing a positive charge is necessary for optimal GABA-A receptor recognition. Additional binding sites are tolerated only if they are part of a charge-delocalized amidinic or guanidinic system. If this delocalization is achieved by linking a butyric acid moiety to the N(2) nitrogen of a 3-aminopyridazine, GABA-antagonistic character is produced. The highest potency (approximately equal to 250 times bicuculline) was observed when an aromatic pi system, bearing electron-donating substituents, was present on the 6-position of the pyridazine ring.", 
    "22": "A tracer radioligand technique employing [3H]Ro 15-1788 was used to measure in vivo benzodiazepine receptor occupancy in mice. Animals were administered clonazepam (CNZ) or lorazepam (LRZ) i.p. or i.v., followed by [3H]Ro 15-1788. Plasma and cerebral cortical concentrations of the drug and cortical benzodiazepine receptor occupancy were determined at varying doses and times after administration. For both drugs, plasma and brain concentrations decreased in parallel with decreasing doses and with time, and the brain/plasma ratios remained constant. Receptor occupancy was maximal for CNZ and LRZ at doses above 1 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, and decreased with decreasing doses. Comparison of receptor occupancy with brain concentration yielded IC50 values of 21 ng/g for CNZ and 133 ng/g for LRZ. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) for CNZ was 56 pmol/g and, for LRZ, 372 pmol/g. Hill plots yielded slopes of 1.30 for CNZ and 1.71 for LRZ. Alterations in the nonspecific uptake or elimination of Ro 15-1788 did not explain occupancy changes, inasmuch as brain concentrations of unlabeled Ro 15-1788 (6 mg/kg) were not changed by LRZ administration. The correlation between receptor occupancy and the pharmacodynamic actions of these drugs in blocking pentylenetetrazol seizures and inducing rotarod ataxia indicated that ED50 for these effects occurred at receptor occupancy of 30 to 60% for both drugs.", 
    "23": "The benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-3-carbomethoxy-beta-carboline (DMCM) (1.5-15 mg/kg) was administered to mice 5 min after a lethal (LD94) injection of pentobarbital. DMCM (1.5-5 mg/kg) increased short-term (1 h) survival in a dose-dependent fashion, with an optimum survival rate more than five times greater than mice receiving pentobarbital alone. Statistically significant increases in long-term (24 h) survival were also observed after both 5 and 10 mg/kg of DMCM (34 and 33%, respectively) compared with animals receiving pentobarbital alone (6%). Two doses of DMCM (5 and 2.5 mg/kg, respectively) administered 55 min apart produced an even greater increase (58%) in 24-h survival rates. Doses of DMCM that increased 1- and 24-h survival were not lethal when administered alone, and were below the dose that produced convulsions in 50% (CD50) of the animals. The protective effects of DMCM were blocked by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor agonist ethyl-8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo- 4H-imidazo[1,5a][1,4]benzodiazodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-1788), which suggests the effects of DMCM are mediated through the benzodiazepine receptor. These findings suggest that DMCM or another benzodiazepine receptor ligand with full inverse agonist qualities could prove effective as an antidote for barbiturate intoxication in man.", 
    "24": "Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to measure the binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine receptors after ischemia by means of transient occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries in the gerbil. [3H]Muscimol was used to label the GABAA receptors and [3H]flunitrazepam to label central type benzodiazepine receptors. In the superolateral convexities of the frontal cortices, [3H]muscimol binding was increased in 60% of the animals killed 3 days after ischemia, and decreased in 67% of the animals killed 27 days after ischemia. Twenty-seven days after ischemia, [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the substantia nigra pars reticulata increased to 252% of the control, though the increase in [3H]muscimol binding was not significant. In the dorsolateral region of the caudate putamen, marked neuronal necrosis and depletion of both [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites were observed 27 days after ischemia, the ventromedial region being left intact. In spite of the depletion of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, both [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites were preserved 27 days after ischemia. Since our previous study revealed that adenosine A1 binding sites were depleted in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus after ischemia correlating with neuronal damage, GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors may not be distributed predominantly on the pyramidal cells in the CA1 region.", 
    "25": "The pharmacokinetics of tetrazepam (Myolastan, Musaril), were studied in 12 healthy volunteers. Tetrazepam was given orally as a single dose of 50 mg and repeated administration for 5 consecutive days of 50 mg at 12-h intervals, in tablet form. Tetrazepam was measured in plasma using a selective and sensitive GLC method. Tetrazepam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a peak plasma level of 0.49 +/- 0.10 mg/l at 0.94 +/- 0.47 h. The drug is widely distributed in the organism with an apparent volume of distribution of 6.7 +/- 2.1 l/kg. Tetrazepam is eliminated with a half-life of 22 +/- 4 h and can be classified as a benzodiazepine with medium half-life value. This medium half-life is the result of the high hepatic clearance of the drug in spite of its large distribution volume. Since in this study 6 male and 6 female volunteers were studied it was possible to compare the pharmacokinetic profile in the two groups. No significant differences were observed. No differences were observed between the pharmacokinetic values after a single dose or after repeated administration.", 
    "26": "[3H]Glutamic acid binding to hippocampi was increased after amygdaloid kindling in rats, and diazepam inhibited this increased binding, without any effect on the enhanced binding by CaCl2 or the binding in control rats. By inducing kindling in the same way as that used in the binding experiment, the inhibiting effects of diazepam on kindled seizures, the afterdischarge and the development of kindling were observed.", 
    "27": "CL 218,872, tracazolate and tofisopam are compounds that are believed to act at the GABA-benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor complex in the CNS and that have anxiolytic properties in animals or in man. Doses of each drug were selected to elevate, or to depress, exploratory head-dipping and locomotor activity in the holeboard in mice, and the development of tolerance to these effects was investigated. As previously found with benzodiazepines, tolerance did not develop to the stimulant effects of low doses of these compounds after 10 days pretreatment with either a low (stimulant) or a high (depressant) dose of the same compound. When animals were pretreated with a low (stimulant) dose, tolerance did not develop to the depressant effects of a high test dose. Tolerance was observed only to the depressant effects of a high dose of a drug, and only when animals were also pretreated with a high dose. The results are compared with those obtained with benzodiazepines, and the ability of current theories of tolerance to account for the results is discussed.", 
    "28": "cDNAs containing the entire coding sequence of endozepine, a putative ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor, were isolated from bovine and human cDNA libraries. These libraries were constructed using a novel oligonucleotide adapter molecule that allowed us to combine the use of G/C tailing with the preservation of the unique Eco RI site in the vector, lambda gt10. The amino acid sequences derived from these cDNA clones are identical to those previously determined for the purified proteins and are homologous to a related rat protein termed diazepam-binding inhibitor. The endozepine proteins are highly conserved, as illustrated by the finding that the nucleotide sequences of the coding regions are 93% conserved between the bovine and human forms. Analysis of these sequences indicates that endozepine is not, as expected, derived from a precursor molecule containing a transient signal peptide. Moreover, Northern analyses using the cloned cDNAs as hybridization probes indicate that the 650-nucleotide endozepine mRNA is expressed in a number of peripheral tissues in addition to brain. These observations may be consistent with a recent report describing the presence in peripheral tissues of benzodiazepine receptors on the outer mitochondrial membrane (Anholt et al., 1986). In addition to the endozepine cDNAs, we also isolated a bovine cDNA clone which encodes a larger protein, a portion of which is homologous to endozepine. This related protein may be synthesized in a precursor form containing putative signal peptide and membrane-spanning domains.", 
    "29": "Three doses (15, 30 and 60 mg) of Org 2305 (O 15, O 30 and O 60 respectively), a novel anxiolytic drug chemically related to mianserin, were compared with placebo and 15 mg diazepam (DZ) on human psychomotor performance in a double-blind, cross-over study with 15 healthy volunteers. Objective measurements (choice reaction, tracking, flicker fusion, Maddox wing, digit symbol substitution, memory recall) and subjective assessments (visual analogue scales) were done at baseline and 2 and 13 h after the first dose. This testing procedure was repeated on day 7 when administering the seventh consecutive daily night-time dose. After the first dose O 15 did not differ from placebo and O 30 rarely differed from placebo. O 60 impaired various objective functions similarly to, or less than DZ. Subjectively, DZ and O 60 were felt as sedative. During subchronic treatment, DZ caused some impairment of baseline due to accumulation of bioassayable benzodiazepines, but significant responses to the last DZ dose were less than those to the first dose. DZ but not O 60 was reported to have caused lethargy and clumsiness during subchronic treatment. In the doses used Org 2305 impaired psychomotor performance less than diazepam did. A dose of 60 mg Org 2305 may offer some advantage over 15 mg diazepam, provided that their anxiolytic effects are about similar.", 
    "30": "The effects of the anxiolytic drugs diazepam (5 mg) or buspirone (5 or 10 mg) were studied in comparison with placebo on memory function in 39 subjects diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. Neither drug altered the immediate recall of a list of 16 nouns or impaired digit span, a second test of immediate memory. Diazepam selectively impaired the recall of nouns after a 20 min delay when compared with placebo. In contrast, neither dose of buspirone altered the delayed recall of the word list. The implications of such different effects of anxiolytic drugs on memory function for the clinical treatment of anxiety are discussed.", 
    "31": "A volunteer study was undertaken to assess the respiratory effects of ethyl loflazepate, a new benzodiazepine, and to correlate these with plasma concentrations of the active metabolites. Twelve volunteers were given placebo, 2 mg ethyl loflazepate, and 6 mg ethyl loflazepate on separate occasions. Respiration and plasma metabolite levels were assessed hourly for 8 h and at 24 h. The 6 mg ethyl loflazepate treatment produced a significant decrease (P less than 0.02) in the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide at 5 h. However this did not equate with a peak in plasma metabolite concentrations which were maintained at a plateau level from 4 to 24 h.", 
    "32": "Buspirone is a new antianxiety compound of a totally new type which may avoid the dependence problems of its predecessors. This study was designed to evaluate any possible cross-tolerance to the benzodiazepines. Twenty-four outpatients on long-term therapeutic dose benzodiazepine treatment, who wished to discontinue treatment, were allocated randomly to placebo substitution or buspirone substitution and then withdrawal over a total of 10 weeks. Assessments were made at weekly intervals. Of the 24 patients entered into the trial, 13 received buspirone and 11 placebo. Only five of the buspirone and six of the placebo patients successfully completed withdrawal. Some anxiolytic action of buspirone was detected, but it was insufficient to materially assist the withdrawal. No evidence was found that buspirone was cross-tolerant to the benzodiazepines. It was concluded that buspirone does not help benzodiazepine withdrawal and does not suppress benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "33": "Behavioral effects of the beta-carboline derivatives ZK 93423 (6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) and ZK 91296 (5-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester) were compared with those of lorazepam and suriclone in squirrel monkeys. Two groups of monkeys were trained to respond under a fixed-interval schedule of food presentation. In one group, responding was suppressed (punished) by superimposing a fixed-ratio schedule of response-produced electric shock. Dose-effect curves were determined for all drugs by administering single doses i.m. 15 min before the start of the fixed-interval schedule. Low and intermediate doses of ZK 93423 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), ZK 91296 (0.3-10.0 mg/kg), lorazepam (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) and suriclone (0.003-0.03 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in the rates of both suppressed and nonsuppressed responding. The increases in response rates normally produced by maximally effective doses of ZK 93423, ZK 91296, lorazepam or suriclone were eliminated when the drugs were given in combination with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. Although many beta-carboline derivatives have been found to act as \"inverse agonists\" at benzodiazepine recognition sites, the present results show that ZK 93423 and ZK 91296 have clear benzodiazepine-like (agonist) effects on schedule-controlled behavior in squirrel monkeys.", 
    "34": "Glutamate or a related excitatory amino acid is thought to be the major excitatory neurotransmitter of hippocampal afferents, intrinsic neurons, and efferents. We have used an autoradiographic technique to investigate the status of excitatory amino acid receptors in the hippocampal formation of patients dying with dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). We examined L-[3H]glutamate binding to sections from the hippocampal formation of six patients dying of DAT and six patients without DAT and found marked reductions in total [3H]glutamate binding in all regions of hippocampus and adjacent parahippocampal cortex in DAT brains as compared to controls. When subtypes of excitatory amino acid receptors were assayed, it was found that binding to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-sensitive receptor was reduced by 75-87%, with the greatest loss found in stratum moleculare and stratum pyramidale of CA1. Binding to quisqualate (QA)-sensitive receptors was reduced by 45-69%. There were smaller reductions (21-46%) in GABAA receptors in DAT cases. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors assayed in adjacent sections of hippocampal formation were unchanged in DAT. Benzodiazepine receptors were reduced significantly only in parahippocampal cortex by 44%. These results suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission within the hippocampal formation is likely to be severely impaired in Alzheimer's disease. Such impairment may account for some of the cognitive decline and memory deficits that characterize DAT.", 
    "35": "In conscious dogs with esophageal, gastric and pancreatic fistulae, sham-feeding and meat feeding increased the pancreatic protein secretion to a peak, reaching about 39% and 69% of CCK8 maximum, and raised plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP) levels. Pirenzepine given intravenously (i.v.) (30 nmol.kg-1 or 3 mumol.kg-1) reduced dose-dependently the pancreatic protein and plasma PP responses to sham-feeding and meat feeding, being about 100 times less potent as an inhibitor than atropine. Neither pirenzepine nor atropine affected near-maximal pancreatic bicarbonate and protein responses to secretin (164 pmol.kg-1.h-1) and CCK8 (170 pmol.kg-1.h-1), but both antimuscarinic agents significantly inhibited pancreatic responses to lower doses of these secretagogues. When added to the incubation medium of dispersed canine pancreatic acini, pirenzepine reduced dose-dependently the amylase responses only to urecholine, and not to CCK or gastrin, being about 1000 times less potent as an inhibitor than atropine. This report provides an evidence that pirenzepine inhibits pancreatic secretion in a similar manner to atropine, but that pirenzepine, in both in vivo and in vitro studies, is 2-3 orders of magnitude less potent as an inhibitor than atropine, indicating that the muscarinic pathway of the exocrine pancreas has a low affinity for pirenzepine and may thus involve M2-receptors.", 
    "36": "Responses of NlE-115 neuroblastoma cells to application of carbachol were studied using intracellular recording techniques. Activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors by carbachol resulted in a depolarization of the cells. The response was blocked by pirenzepine (1 microM) and by CoCl2 (5 mM), verapamil (10 microM) and gallopamil (10 microM), and prolonged by quinine (5 mM). It is suggested that muscarinic receptors increase the membrane calcium permeability, and that the influx of calcium activates calcium dependent potassium channels.", 
    "37": "Alcohol and benzodiazepines may increase sleep-disordered breathing by decreasing activity of pharyngeal dilating muscles, favoring the development of obstructive apneas and hypopneas. Narcotics cause greater depression of wakeful respiration than the previously mentioned drugs; however, the influence of narcotics on the upper airway and breathing during sleep has not been studied. We, therefore, examined, in 12 healthy adults, the effects of oral hydromorphone hydrochloride (2 and 4 mg) on breathing during sleep and on a variety of awake respiratory variables (minute ventilation, gas exchange, and chemoresponsiveness). In addition, awake pharyngeal inspiratory airflow resistance was determined before and after narcotic administration to assess the drug's influence on patency of the upper airway. Following both doses, minute ventilation decreased, and carbon dioxide pressure increased. The 4-mg dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride also produced a significant decrement in the hypoxic ventilatory response, whereas hypercapnic responsiveness and pharyngeal resistance did not change following either dose of the drug. Despite the respiratory depression during wakefulness described previously, no significant change was observed in any measure of sleep-disordered breathing after either dose of narcotic. We conclude that in healthy individuals without suspected sleep apnea, oral hydromorphone in standard dosages does not significantly increase sleep-disordered breathing. This result may be due to a lack of selective depression of upper-airway muscular function by the doses of narcotic used.", 
    "38": "Long-term administration of various types of antidepressant drugs has been recently reported to reduce the density of benzodiazepine receptors in the rat CNS. In the present study, using the microiontophoretic technique, the effect of flurazepam application on cholecystokinin-induced activation of hippocampal pyramidal neurons was assessed in rats treated with the antidepressants desipramine, trimipramine and citalopram, and the antipsychotic chlorpromazine, for 3 weeks. All 3 antidepressant drugs, but not chlorpromazine, reduced the efficacy of flurazepam. A two-week treatment with desipramine produced a similar effect, whereas a one-week treatment with this drug failed to alter the effect of flurazepam. These results constitute further evidence that long-term antidepressant treatment down-regulates benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "39": "The feasibility of determining trace analytes in human serum using on-line preconcentration and microbore high-performance liquid chromatography has been demonstrated. The serum is subjected to ultracentrifugation and injected onto a hydrophobic pre-column using water as the mobile phase. This traps the components of interest which are then backflushed onto a microbore analytical column using a stronger mobile phase. The column-switching apparatus was evaluated using highly dilute aqueous paraben solutions and sample enrichment factors as high as 1500 were obtained. The procedure was then applied to diazepam in serum. Recovery was linear and quantitative over the range from at least 4 to 1000 ng/ml. The method was specific against caffeine and the three major metabolites of diazepam: oxazepam, temazepam, and nordiazepam. The effects of varying pre-column dimensions, pre-column loading time, and sample volume were evaluated.", 
    "40": "Treatment of mice with lorazepam 10 mg/kg p.o. or FG 7142 40 mg/kg i.p. once a day for 14 days changed the effects of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands injected acutely on the threshold of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures. The effects of the two pretreatments differed qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Lorazepam elicited a shift in the effects of all BZ receptor ligands tested, whereby the agonists lorazepam and ZK 93423 now acted like partial agonists given acutely, the partial agonist ZK 91296 acted like an antagonist and the antagonists Ro 15-1788 and ZK 93426 like partial inverse agonists. The proconvulsant effects of the partial inverse agonist FG 7142 and the full inverse agonist DMCM on the PTZ-induced seizures did not change. However, FG 7142 became a full inverse agonist i.e. became convulsant, and DMCM may have increased in potency as a convulsant. After FG 7142 pretreatment lorazepam and ZK 93423 behaved like partial agonists given acutely whereas there was no change in effect for ZK 91296, Ro 15-1788 and ZK 93426. FG 7142 became convulsant (i.e. kindling occurred) and the potency of DMCM as a convulsant was non-significantly increased, while their proconvulsant effects with respect to PTZ-induced seizures were not altered. The fact that the effects of the two very different pretreatments on the BZ receptor ligand continuum were in the same direction may be explainable by assuming two different mechanisms, both of which may involve the GABA receptors.", 
    "41": "Mechanically dissociated neuronal somata from the thoracic ganglia of Locusta migratoria and Schistocerca gregaria were viable in vitro for hours and were current- and voltage-clamped to record the responses evoked by brief pressure applications of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the presence of various modulators. The application of GABA and muscimol, but not baclofen, produced a hyperpolarization and concurrent increase in the membrane conductance. The current underlying this response reversed at -65 mV, was evoked in all cells tested and showed outward rectification. In 6 of 74 Locusta neurones but not in the neurones of Schistocerca, GABA and muscimol evoked a biphasic response. The initial, fast phase was indistinguishable from the GABA-evoked current seen in all neurones. The remaining predominant, slow and long-duration component of the response was an inward current over the membrane potential range 0 to -80 mV, increasing with hyperpolarization. The GABAA antagonists bicuculline and pitrazepin were without effect on the fast GABA response while picrotoxin was a potent blocker of both the fast and the slow GABA responses. Flunitrazepam enhanced the amplitude of the fast response by up to 70% without increasing its duration. Sodium pentobarbital enhanced both the amplitude and the duration of the fast GABA response. We conclude that the locust thoracic neuronal GABA receptor/channel complex resembles the vertebrate GABAA receptor in having associated modulatory receptor sites for benzodiazepines and barbiturates, but differs from it in terms of the pharmacology of the GABA receptor itself.", 
    "42": "The blood-brain transport and regional distribution of a tritium-labeled, brominated benzodiazepine (BFB) was determined for the rat brain in vivo. The unidirectional transport constant from blood to brain was measured by a graphical, integral method and was found to be 0.83 ml/g/min, a value which indicates that transport is essentially flow-dependent. The apparent volume of distribution increased linearly during the measurement period, suggesting that back transport from brain to blood was zero and that BFB was trapped in the tissue, possibly by specific receptors or acceptors. Under the conditions of these experiments, autoradiography of brain tissue sections indicated a regional distribution of [3H]BFB similar to that expected for regional cerebral blood flow. These results indicate that BFB is a useful blood flow tracer in brain and suggest that BFB radiobrominated with bromine-75 may, under appropriate conditions, be a suitable tracer for in vivo regional blood flow measurement or benzodiazepine receptor mapping by positron-emission tomography.", 
    "43": "The high density of 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in the thick ascending loop of Henle (TAL) of the kidney prompted an evaluation of the effects of anions and anion channel blockers on these sites. [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to rat kidney membranes was inhibited by halides in a concentration dependent fashion. Significant differences were observed in the efficacies (i.e. maximal effect achieved) of these halides to inhibit [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding. The effects of halides to inhibit this binding was manifest as a reduction in the apparent affinity of this radioligand with no effect on the maximum number of binding sites. The concentration necessary to achieve half maximal inhibition was around the physiologic range for Cl- in all extracellular body fluids. A strong correlation (r = 0.95; P less than 0.001) was obtained between the permeability of anions relative to Cl- and their efficacies to inhibit [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding. DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid), an ion transport blocker, inhibited [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to a maximum of 80%. The presence of Na2SO4 enhanced the potency of DIDS up to five-fold giving an IC50 of 43 +/- 6 microM. In contrast, the binding of [3H]PK 11195 was unaffected by DIDS and only slightly inhibited by I-. These data demonstrate that characteristics of radioligand binding to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in the kidney are regulated by anions and anion transport blockers and suggest that the PBR may play an important role in anion transport. Additionally, these data suggest that the sites at which [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 bind on the PBR may be overlapping, but not identical.", 
    "44": "The nature of the putative muscarinic receptor subtypes involved in vagally mediated bronchoconstriction was examined in the rabbit model utilizing the classical muscarinic antagonist atropine and the selective antagonist pirenzepine. In vivo electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerves in anesthetized rabbits resulted in a reproducible increase in pulmonary resistance indicative of bronchoconstriction and a marked negative chronotropic effect on the heart. Both atropine and pirenzepine produced dose-related inhibition of these two vagal effects. Fifty percent inhibition of the vagally induced increase in pulmonary resistance was achieved with an infusion of pirenzepine that was only 8-fold greater than the equi-effective dose of atropine. In contrast, the dose of pirenzepine required to inhibit the vagally induced decrease in heart rate by 50% was 100-fold greater than the atropine dose. Thus, pirenzepine is markedly more potent in inhibiting vagally mediated bronchoconstriction than bradycardia. In vitro inhibition of methacholine-induced contraction of bronchial rings with atropine and pirenzepine yielded pA2 values of 8.86 and 6.88 respectively (95-fold potency ratio), demonstrating that the muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle cells that mediate contraction are not of the pirenzepine-sensitive subtype.", 
    "45": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS) were demonstrated in the cell membranes of various organs (ovary, uterus, oviduct, pituitary and kidney) of mature and immature female rats by using the PBS-specific ligand [3H]PK 11195. The equilibrium dissociation constants of [3H]PK 11195 for PBS in mature rats ranged from 3 to 4 nM. The specific binding of [3H]PK 11195 (2 nM) in the hypophyseal-genital axis of immature (19-27 days old) female rats was found to be significantly increased in the ovary and uterus, concurrently with the increase in age. Administration of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin or diethylstilbestrol to immature rats increased the density of PBS in the ovary and uterus 2- to 3-fold but no change was found in the kidney. The affinity of [3H]PK 11195 to these tissues did not change following hormonal treatment. These results suggest that gonadotropin and estrogen are involved in the induction of PBS in the organs of the hypophyseal-genital axis in female rats.", 
    "46": "Five pigeons were trained to discriminate IM injections of oxazepam (4.0 mg/kg) from vehicle with responding maintained under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule of food delivery. Under test conditions, responding increased in a dose-dependent manner in all pigeons after the administration of other benzodiazepines including diazepam (0.01-1.0 mg/kg), temazepam (0.01-3.0 mg/kg), halazepam (0.1-56.0 mg/kg), and midazolam (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) as well as the barbiturate pentobarbital (2.0-8.0 mg/kg) and the non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic CL 218,872 (1.0-8.0 mg/kg). At the higher doses of each of these compounds, over 80% of responding occurred on the oxazepam-appropriate key. Cocaine (0.5-4.0 mg/kg), bupropion (3.0-56.0 mg/kg) and nortriptyline (3.0-56.0 mg/kg) failed to substitute for oxazepam even at doses that decreased rates of responding. The discriminative stimulus (DS) effects of the lowest doses of oxazepam and CL 218,872 that produced 100% drug-appropriate responding were blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. This antagonism was reversed by increasing the dose of the agonists. The DS effects of diazepam were antagonized partially by Ro 15-1788 (3 of 5 pigeons), and the antagonism was reversed by higher doses of diazepam in two of these pigeons. The DS effects of pentobarbital were antagonized by Ro 15-1788 in 2 of 5 pigeons, but the blockade was not reversed by higher pentobarbital doses.", 
    "47": "In order to assess the role played by serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline in anxiety, four groups of healthy volunteers were given 25 mg of the selective inhibitor of 5-HT uptake chlorimipramine, 50 mg of the selective inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake maprotiline, 1 mg of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic lorazepam or placebo, and submitted to a simulated public speaking (SPS) test, consisting of speaking in front of a videocamera. Subjective anxiety was evaluated by the visual analog mood scale (VAMS) of Norris as well as by the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) of Spielberger. Chlorimipramine enhanced SPS-induced anxiety, whereas maprotiline and lorazepam reduced anxiety during as well as outside the test period. Mental and physical sedation (VAMS) were increased by either maprotiline or lorazepam. In a scale of bodily symptoms, chlorimipramine tended to increase muscle tension, agitation and palpitation, whereas maprotiline caused lethargy. The rise in blood pressure induced by the SPS procedure outlasted the period of stress in the group treated with chlorimipramine. In contrast, the SPS-induced increase in heart rate was enhanced by lorazepam. Chlor imipramine and maprotiline reduced salivation to the same extent. Pupillary diameter, however, was significantly increased by chlorimipramine alone. It may be tentatively sug gested that the proanxiogenic effect of chlorimipramine is related to changes in central 5-HT neurotransmission while the anxiolytic effect of maprotiline is associated with alteration of noradrenergic mechanisms. Increased peripheral sympathetic tone may also contribute to the proanxiety action of chlorimipramine.", 
    "48": "The discriminative stimulus effect of midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, was used for testing the effects of related drugs including agents thought to act at different sites in the proposed benzodiazepine receptor complex. Rats were trained in a standard two- bar operant conditioning procedure with food reinforcers delivered on a tandem schedule. The 0.4 mg/kg dose of midazolam used for training was well discriminated, typically yielding about 95% correct responding. There was no generalization to the GABA agonists muscimol and THIP, to the 5-HT antagonists cyproheptadine and methergoline, to buspirone, CGS 9896, ethanol, Ro 5-4864, promethazine, phenytoin sodium or sodium valproate. Muscimol and THIP also failed to potentiate the effects of midazolam. The GABA antagonist bicuculline weakly attenuated the discriminative effect of midazolam without impairing generalization to pentobarbitone, whereas the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 did not attenuate the effect of midazolam. The results provide additional evidence for the notable specificity of the midazolam cue but do little to link the behavioural effects of benzodiazepines to GABA or 5- HT systems. Perhaps the potency, efficacy or selectivity of the GABA agonists was inadequate to produce the expected results. Only the effects of bicuculline, and those reported previously for picrotoxin, provided some support for the hypothesis that midazolam cue is mediated by the GABA system.", 
    "49": "Drugs acting at benzodiazepine receptors can have two types of pharmacological profile: benzodiazepine agonists are anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and sedative, whilst benzo diazepine inverse agonists cause anxiety and convulsions. In 1982 we showed that a benzo diazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, prevented the effects of both types of compound at doses without intrinsic activity in the tests used. We put forward the hypothesis that the benzo diazepine receptor complex could undergo two possible conformational changes, resulting in increases (benzodiazepine agonists) or decreases (benzodiazepine inverse agonists) in the effects of the inhibitory transmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This concept has been widely accepted. We have now studied the effects of inverse agonists after chronic treatment with inverse agonists themselves and with benzodiazepine agonists, in order to see if tolerance develops (as seen with the agonists) or whether an opposite change occurs.", 
    "50": "The effects of 5-HT agonists and antagonists, benzodiazepine anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants on restraint stress-induced anorexia in rats were examined. The selective 5-HT(1A) agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di- n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), buspirone and ipsapirone, when injected 2 h after the termination of stress, attenuated stress-induced anor exia and body weight loss. The effects of 8-OH-DPAT on stress-induced anorexia were blocked by the 5-HT(1A) antagonist spiperone but not by the 5-HT(2) antagonist ketanserin. The preferential 5-HT(1B) agonists RU-24969 and quipazine induced anorexia in unstressed rats and tended to supplement the anorectic effects of stress. The benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide and diazepam and the 5-HT antagonist cyproheptadine had no effect on stress-induced anorexia, when given (like the 5-HT(1A) agonists) 2 h after the stress. Similarly, daily injection for 2 weeks of the tricyclic antidepressants desipramine and sertraline had no beneficial effect. The data suggest that 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone and ipsapirone attenuate stress-induced anorexia in rodents by a hyperphagic action on 5-HT(1A) receptors.", 
    "51": "By use of membrane preparations and incubation conditions optimized for each binding site, we have characterized the benzodiazepine and ionophore-linked-convulsant/barbiturate modulatory sites within the chick tectal GABA(A) receptor complex. Using [(3)H]flunitrazepam (FNZ) and [(35)S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), respectively, as specific radioligand probes for the two sites, we have found in each case one single population of high-affinity, saturable, specific binding sites. The apparent dissociation constants (K(d)) show no change during tectal development (9 nM for [(3)H]FNZ, and 25-28 nM for [(35)S]TBPS) while the respective densities of binding sites at saturation (B(max)) experience in both cases a twofold increase between embryonic day 16 and postnatal day 10. Ligand-specific pharmacological profiles and allosteric interactions between the transmitter and modulatory sites appear to be well preserved in the chick tectal membrane preparations employed in this study.", 
    "52": "The presence of an ionophore site was demonstrated on the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor complex purified from rat brain. [(3)H]Flunitrazepam binding to the purified receptor was enhanced by Clions and barbiturate, compounds that interact with the ionophore site. The enhancement was concentration dependent and antagonized by the convulsant drug picrotoxinin. The site was directly labelled by [(3)S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, a blocking agent of the GABA-controlled ionophore channel. The binding was specific and saturable and showed a dissociation constant of 52 nM.", 
    "53": "The effect of an acute swimming stress in rats on the amount of n-butyl-?-carboline-3-carboxylate, an endogenous benzodiazepine receptor binding inhibitor, was investigated. In 15 min this substance increased two fold in the cerebral cortex of the stressed rat and this increase was blocked by the previous injection of diazepam; however, no changes were observed in the cerebellum with stress. These results are discussed in relation to previous findings that, after the acute stress, [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding decreases in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but not in cerebellum. A possible relationship between this benzodiazepine receptor binding inhibitor and the state of \"anxiety\" produced by stress is postulated.", 
    "54": "The actions of taurine on the solubilized GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex were investigated, and the results compared to those obtained with detergent-treated membrane-bound receptors. The receptor complex of adult rat brain was solubilized with Triton X-100 or CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulphonate). The properties of the solubilized GABA and flunitrazepam binding sites were similar to those in washed brain membranes. Taurine displaced GABA from its receptor sites and inhibited GABA stimulation of flunitrazepam binding to receptor complexes solubilized with Triton X-100. Thus the modulatory action of taurine on the receptor complex in washed membrane preparations was well preserved after this solubilization. No specific taurine binding to either Triton- or CHAPS-solubilized sample could be demonstrated.", 
    "55": "The effects of oxazepam and diazepam (both at 10 mg/kg, i.p.) during continuous treatment for 15 days and following discontinuation after 5 days onwards on cerebral glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and GABA-aminotransferase (GABA-T) have been studied. It has been found that during continuous treatment as well as following discontinuation after 5 days, a significant increase in GAD activity is observed in case of diazepam but not in case of oxazepam. On the other hand, a marked decrease in GABA-T activity is observed during continuous treatment up to 15 days with both diazepam and oxazepam but during discontinuation phase, the decreased GABA-T activity tends to increase and attain normal value much earlier in case of oxazepam than diazepam. This differential effect of oxazepam and diazepam on ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism, following discontinuation of treatment, may possibly contribute to the difference in withdrawal effects associated with the two benzodiazepines.", 
    "56": "Purification of solubilized ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine receptors by Nonidet P-40 from the bovine cerebral cortex was employed by the affinity column chromatography using a benzodiazepine, 1012-S, as immobilized ligand. Although this benzodiazepine affinity gel retained all of the solubilized benzodiazepine receptors from synaptic membranes applied to the column, 25.6% of the GABA receptor binding activity was recovered in the run-through fraction. After the washing with NaCl, the biospecific elution with 1 mM 1012-S resulted the elution of 31.3% of GABA receptor binding activity applied to the column. The highest purification fold thus obtained was 3789 (specific activity: 0.39 nmol/mg protein). Successive application of 1-2 mM NaSCN also resulted further elution of GABA receptor. Scatchard analysis of [(3)H]muscimol binding to these fractions indicated that the purified GABA receptor had high and low affinity binding sites as detected in solubilized and synaptic membrane fractions. In addition, it was found that the B(max) values for both binding sites in the 1012-S-eluted fraction increased significantly without changing the K(D) values. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic profiles of the 1012-S-eluted fraction showed the existence of two major bands having the molecular weights of approx. 53,000 and 57,000, both of which were irreversibly photoaffinity-labeled with [(3)H]flunitrazepam. This result made a sharp contrast with the result obtained in the rat brain, in which the subunits of the purified receptor consisted of molecular weights of 48,500 and 54,500 and the former band was selectively photoaffinity-labeled with [(3)H]flunitrazepam. In contrast, the gel filtration using Sephadex G-200 of the purified GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex from both animal species revealed the molecular weight of these receptor complexes was approx. 340,000. These results strongly suggest that the subunit structures of GABA/benzodiazepine receptors from the bovine and rat brains may be essentially different. On the other hand, the purification of GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex and C1 channel solubilized by CHAPS, a non denaturating zwitterionic detergent, using the same benzodiazepine affinity column followed by DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange column chromatography indicated that the purified GABA receptor was functionally coupled with both benzodiazepine receptor and C1 channel. These results also indicate that GABA(A) receptor which is structurally coupled with benzodiazepine receptor and C1 channel is readily purified by the use of this benzodiazepine affinity gel, whereas GABA(B) receptor which is not associated with both components is recovered in its run-through fraction, respectively.", 
    "57": "Chronic ethanol inhalation produced no change in the number or affinity of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding sites on well-washed synaptic membranes prepared from male Quackenbush mice, but produced a significant decrease in the capacity of GABA to enhance [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding. This decrease was characterised by a higher EC(50) (1.4 ? M compared to 0.6 ? M) and a lower maximal level of enhancement (162% compared to 172%) for tissue from the chronically treated animals compared to tissue from control animals. Acute ethanol treatment or ethanol incubated in vitro with the brain membranes did not produce changes in any of the [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding parameters. These results support other findings that chronic ethanol may affect the coupling of various sites on GABA-A receptor-ionophore complexes in brain.", 
    "58": "[(3)H]flunitrazepam binding was assayed in retinae of 25-day-old rats subjected either to unilateral enucleation at day 15, to intracranial unilateral cutting of the optic nerve at day 17, or to unilateral ablation of the visual cortex at day 17 postnatally. Unilateral enucleation resulted in an enhanced [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding in the retina of the remaining eye by 23% (P < 0.002, two-tailed Student t-test) as compared to unoperated controls. In rats with one optic nerve cut shortly before the optic chiasm, benzodiazepine binding in the retina of the lesioned side was significantly higher by 20.4 +/- 7.6% (P < 0.02, N = 10, paired test) in comparison to that in the retina with the intact optic nerve. Unilateral visual cortex ablation resulted in a 13% decrease (P < 0.02) in [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding in the retina contralateral to the brain lesion. In the lesioned rats of all three groups, the retinal benzodiazepine receptors were no longer capable of being modified by light/dark adaptation as is observed in normal rats. Our data suggest that (i) rat retinal benzodiazepine receptors are under a control from the visual cortex, and (ii) the benzodiazepine receptors of both eyes seem to be mutually tuned, presumably via a cortico-retinal feedback loop and an interhemispheric cortico-cortical information transfer.", 
    "59": "The effect of diazepam (10 mg, p.o.) on the responsiveness of eccrine sweat glands to intradermally injected carbachol and on critical flicker fusion frequency was compared in 6 male healthy volunteers under two ambient temperature conditions, 22 degrees C and 35 degrees C. Carbachol evoked dose-related increases in sweat gland activity. Responsiveness to carbachol was significantly enhanced under the 35 degrees C condition as compared to the 22 degrees C condition, this being reflected in a higher value of Emax of the dose-response curve for carbachol under the 35 degrees C condition. Diazepam had no significant effect on responses to carbachol under the 22 degrees C condition, but prevented the increase in responsiveness produced by high ambient temperature. High ambient temperature had no significant effect on critical flicker fusion frequency. Diazepam significantly reduced critical flicker fusion frequency under both temperature conditions. It is suggested that diazepam may block the increase in sympathetic outflow normally evoked by high ambient temperature, thereby preventing the development of sweat gland hyper-responsiveness.", 
    "60": "Under conditions of food deprivation, relative to the equivalent satiation condition, increases in the self-administration of d-amphetamine in three out of three monkeys, of cocaine in two out of three monkeys, and of nicotine in one out of three monkeys, were observed. Furthermore, these increases were dose-dependent, i.e. with low doses there were large increases in number of infusions, but with high doses there were no differences in number of infusions between the two feeding conditions. For some doses of diazepam there were increases in number of infusions under the deprivation condition relative to the satiation condition, but these increases were not statistically significant. In contrast, food deprivation produced slight, but significant, increases in the number of perphenazine infusions in one monkey but inappropriate level responses were also high for this monkey as well. In most cases, increases under food deprivation occurred with drugs that already maintained responding above saline under satiation conditions. Therefore, food deprivation does not appear to convert non-reinforcers into reinforcers, but instead increases intake of drugs that function as reinforcers. This effect may contribute to the persistence of psychomotor stimulant drug-seeking behavior in humans.", 
    "61": "Status epilepticus can complicate any type of seizure activity. A group of 13 children with non-convulsive status has been studied. Five presented with chronic fluctuating neurological features, while eight had intermittent episodes of their atypical status, although each of these lasted for several days. The clinical features, treatment, and outcome for these groups of children are described. Most of the children in both groups are mentally retarded after regressing at the time of their status epilepticus. The recognition and aggressive treatment of atypical status is important in reducing the risk of subsequent mental handicap.", 
    "62": "We have characterized the binding of the selective muscarinic antagonist [3H]pirenzepine ([3H])PZ) and the classical muscarinic antagonist (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ((-)-[3H]QNB) to muscarinic cholinergic sites in rabbit peripheral lung membranes. For both radioligands, high affinity binding with pharmacologic specificity was demonstrated. The high affinity Kd for [3H]PZ binding determined from saturation isotherms was 4.5 nM and the Kd for (-)-[3H]QNB binding was 6.2 pM. Comparison of the total binding capacity values determined by saturation experiments with [3H] PZ and (-)-[3H]QNB demonstrates that approximately 78% of the total muscarinic binding sites in rabbit peripheral lung bind [3H]PZ with high affinity. There was no significant effect of the guanine nucleotide, guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, on the inhibition of (-)-[3H]QNB binding by the muscarinic agonist carbachol in peripheral lung membranes. If the pulmonary muscarinic receptor with high affinity for PZ proves to have an important role in bronchoconstriction, its characterization could result in the development of more selective bronchodilators.", 
    "63": "The objectives of the present studies were 1) to pharmacologically characterize the muscarinic autoreceptors in the striatum and 2) to examine their role in the regulation of physiologic acetylcholine (ACh) release. Schild plots were generated for atropine and pirenzepine against oxotremorine-induced inhibition of [3H]ACh release. Atropine, a nonselective antagonist, yielded a pA2 of 8.92. The pA2 for pirenzepine, a purported M1-selective antagonist, was 7.14. Both Schild plots had slopes not significantly different from one. Four agonists [oxotremorine, carbachol (CARB), McN-A-343 and pilocarpine] were tested for their effectiveness in inhibiting [3H]ACh release. McN-A-343 and pilocarpine have been reported to be selective for M1 receptors. Oxotremorine and carbachol were effective and potent inhibitors of [3H] ACh release, whereas McN-A-343 and pilocarpine were weak. Although the existence of muscarinic receptor subtypes remains an open question, these data are consistent with the \"low\" pirenzepine affinity (M2) subtype. Chronic treatments (14 days) with several agents were carried out (in vivo) to assess the role of muscarinic autoreceptors in the regulation of physiologic ACh release. Scatchard analyses of binding studies with [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate were also performed to assess changes in the muscarinic receptor population in the striatum. Chronic treatment with scopolamine caused a 100% increase in the Bmax for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding but had no effect on the sensitivity of [3H]ACh release to inhibition by CARB. Fourteen-day treatment with physostigmine (3 mg/kg) produced a decrease in the sensitivity of [3H]ACh release to CARB plus a 42% decrease in Bmax and a 48% decrease in Kd for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. Chronic haloperidol treatment caused an increase in the sensitivity of [3H]ACh release to CARB accompanied by a 46% increase in Bmax for 3H quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. These data suggest that muscarinic autoreceptors in the striatum do not regulate physiologic ACh release in the presence of intact acetylcholinesterase and that the interaction of dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons in the striatum may not be simple trans-synaptic inhibition.", 
    "64": "Rats were treated continuously for 12 months with therapeutically equivalent doses of haloperidol (1.4-1.6 mg/kg/day), sulpiride (102-109 mg/kg/day) or clozapine (24-27 mg/kg/day) and examined for alterations in brain glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and 3H-flunitrazepam binding. Administration of haloperidol, but not sulpiride or clozapine, for 6 or 12 months increased striatal GAD activity. None of the drug treatments altered nigral GAD activity when examined after 1, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months administration. The number of specific 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites (Bmax) in striatal membrane preparations were not altered by 12 months administration of haloperidol, sulpiride or clozapine. Surprisingly, Bmax for 3H-flunitrazepam binding to cerebellar membrane preparations was decreased by 12 months administration of all drug treatments. The dissociation constant (Kd) for 3H-flunitrazepam binding in striatal and cerebellar preparations was not altered. The ability of GABA (0.25-100 microM) alone, and in conjunction with sodium chloride (200 mM), to stimulate specific 3H-flunitrazepam binding in striatal and cerebellar preparations was unaltered by haloperidol, sulpiride or clozapine administration for 12 months. The selective effect of haloperidol, but not sulpiride or clozapine, treatment on striatal GAD activity parallels the ability of haloperidol, but not sulpiride or clozapine, to induce striatal dopamine receptor supersensitivity in the same animals. The actions of haloperidol may reflect its greater ability to induce tardive dyskinesia compared to sulpiride or clozapine.", 
    "65": "A case of chronic schizophrenia complicated by agoraphobia expressed as an exacerbation of negative symptoms is presented. The patient responded to diazepam combined with behavior therapy. The need to recognize treatable factors contributing to negative symptoms of schizophrenia is discussed.", 
    "66": "Cimetidine has been shown to inhibit the oxidative metabolism of a variety of low- and high-extraction drugs. Despite the findings of initial investigators, there is evidence that ranitidine may exert similar effects. Eight healthy volunteer subjects took part in a within-subject crossover study. They received midazolam, 15 mg, by mouth after pretreatment with cimetidine, ranitidine, or nothing and midazolam, 10 mg, intravenously on separate occasions. Mean absolute bioavailability of midazolam was increased by more than 30% after cimetidine (P less than 0.01) and 26% after ranitidine (P less than 0.05). The data, which agree with a concurrent clinical study indicating greater hypnotic action of midazolam after ranitidine, indicate that this is not a result of enhanced midazolam absorption and that reduced hepatic clearance is the most likely explanation.", 
    "67": "In order to check whether the benzodiazepine, oxazepam (OZ), has a modulating effect on the development of liver cancer, it was given to rats previously submitted to two different protocols of hepatocarcinogenesis: the resistant hepatocyte protocol and Pitot's model (initiation-promotion). Its effects were compared with those of phenobarbital (PB) administered under the same conditions. As compared with basal diet, a diet containing 0.05% of PB and 0.1% of OZ enhanced, in both models, the development of gamma-glutamyltransferase-positive lesions in early stages. OZ also had a promoting effect on the development of liver cancers in later stages in both models whereas PB only enhanced it in the resistant hepatocyte protocol. Thus, like PB, OZ may have a promoting effect on liver cancer in rats.", 
    "68": "The present trial was designed to compare the effect of metoclopramide(MCP) + dexamethasone(DM) (Method A) with that of MCP + DM + lorazepam(Lor) (Method B) in the treatment of CDDP (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum)-induced nausea and vomiting in a randomized fashion. The results were collected by questionnaire given to 50 patients. The dosage of CDDP was 80-100 mg/m2. In addition, MMC and VDS, or VP-16 were used concurrently. Within 24 hours after the administration of CDDP, vomiting was not observed in 72% and 88% of the patients treated with Method A and Method B, respectively, and nausea was not noted in 48% and 68%, respectively. Marked malaise was observed in 36% of patients in the Method A group and in 12% in the Method B group. With respect to the extent of comfort, 16% of patients in the Method A group and 56% in the Method B group felt good. Sixteen percent in the Method A group and 56% in the Method B group were satisfied with the anti-emetic treatment. Thus, Method B was significantly superior to Method A with regard to the degree of comfort and treatment satisfaction.", 
    "69": "In a prospective study of 25 patients from the time of hospitalization, seven had recently discontinued psychotropic agents (including antidepressants, neuroleptics, and benzodiazepines). All seven had positive dexamethasone suppression test results after 1 week of hospitalization. This phenomenon did not occur in any of the other subjects who had not discontinued such medications. Some of the subjects with postdexamethasone cortisol increases reported drug discontinuation in the drug histories they gave at admission, but in three, drug screening provided the only evidence of prior drug use. Medication withdrawal may be an underappreciated confounding variable in DST studies.", 
    "70": "Diazepam has well-known amnestic properties. These effects, however, are selective for certain psychobiologically distinct memory functions. In this study, incremental doses of diazepam administered to 10 normal volunteers selectively impaired anterograde episodic memory and attention while totally sparing access to information in long-term memory (semantic or knowledge memory). This pattern of disruption mimics that seen in patients with organic amnesias and is in sharp contrast to the pattern seen in patients with dementia. These findings provide a framework for defining specific psychobiological determinants of cognitive failure.", 
    "71": "We studied three patients: two with voice and hand tremor, and one with voice tremor. Voice tremor was associated with synchronous rhythmic contraction of cricothyroid and rectus abdominis muscles, but not always vocalis muscle. Voice tremor was manifested only in voluntary phonation or expiration, not in involuntary phonation, voluntary inspiration, or involuntary expiration and inspiration (breathing at rest). Impaired regulation of the CNS programs innervating the voluntary expiratory muscles probably causes voice tremor. Clonazepam and propranolol were helpful in blinded studies.", 
    "72": "Fentanyl is a synthetic narcotic which, when administered intravenously, has a rapid onset and short duration of action. It produces less cardiovascular depression than either meperidine or morphine. Experience with 100 examinations performed using intravenous fentanyl and diazepam for analgesia and sedation in adults is reviewed. There were no complications, and effective analgesia was obtained in all cases. Fentanyl has distinct pharmacologic advantages over both morphine and meperidine for use in radiologic special procedures.", 
    "73": "The interaction of a representative benzodiazepine, flurazepam, and ethanol has been assessed in ICR albino mice. Tests done included loss of \"rotarod\" performance, light sedation, deep sedation, loss of righting reflex, anesthesia, and lethality. LD50 and ED50s were plotted as isobolograms (plots of equieffective dose combinations). Data for anaesthesia and lethality showed little or no interaction between the two drugs. In contrast, the four motor and behaviour tests showed synergism, especially with higher doses of ethanol (over 2 g/kg) for righting reflex, and (over 1.5 g/kg) for deep sedation. Synergism occurred over all doses for light sedation and rotarod performance. It is expected that concurrent use of benzodiazepines and ethanol can result in a significantly higher accident risk in humans, but little additional risk of death from simple overdose.", 
    "74": "Oxazepam was measured in plasma and breast milk during 3 days of medication and 10 and 34 h after the last dose. The half-life estimated from levels in plasma and milk was approximately 12 hours. Less than 1/1000 of the maternal dose would have been excreted in 1 l breast milk.", 
    "75": "Immature oviduct implants from quails stimulated by estrogen to induce ciliogenesis were submitted to the in vitro action of benzodiazepines in organotypic culture. Diazepam and medazepam were added to the culture medium for 24 or 48 hours and tissues were examined by transmission and scanning electron microscopy for alterations in ciliary differentiation. Ciliogenesis was inhibited by both diazepam and medazepam, which affected mainly the migration of the basal bodies. Assembly of basal bodies was achieved normally in the cytoplasm, but their separation from generative complexes and migration toward the apical membrane were prevented. They remained in clusters around a deuterosome or eventually anchored to the close lateral plasma membrane. Furthermore, the drugs affected mature beating cilia, which then appeared lying tangentially to the cell surface. Relation between basal bodies and cortical cytoskeleton seemed to be altered by the drugs, which implies that the bearing of cilia and probably the ciliary beating movement were modified. Microvillus development was also altered by the action of these drugs.", 
    "76": "This study evaluated the effects of acute doses of zopiclone (7.5 mg), triazolam (0.25 mg) and placebo on memory and psychomotor performance of 12 normal volunteers. The subjects received both drugs in a repeated measure, double-blind Latin square design. The tests (CFF, CRT, DSST, memory assessments) were performed before and 2 and 6 hr after treatment. Zopiclone and triazolam induced an anterograde amnesia affecting short-term and long-term memory which lasted less than 6 hr. No retrograde amnesia was observed. Two hr after drug intake of both hypnotics psychomotor performances were significantly altered compared with placebo. The subjects also felt more drowsy, dizzy, clumsy and tired, and less alert and energetic 2 hr after zopiclone and triazolam compared to placebo. There was no difference between the effects of the two hypnotics at the doses studied.", 
    "77": "An elderly female alcohol and benzodiazepine addict presented with an atypical amnestic episode. Five days later she showed several complex partial seizures as main signs of a withdrawal state. The value of the EEG in the differential diagnosis of amnestic syndromes is emphasized. Temporolimbic involvement in withdrawal states is discussed and our ignorance regarding drug dependence and withdrawal in the elderly is stressed. It is suggested that late-onset partial seizures with unknown etiology in the elderly might be more often related to drug dependence than generally accepted."
