Fosphenytoin (FPHT) is recommended for second-line therapy; however, intravenous injection of levetiracetam (LEV) may also be effective against status epilepticus. Herein, we compared the efficacy and safety of LEV as a second-line treatment for status epilepticus with FPHT in Japanese patients.Patients with status epilepticus were selected from the database of the Emergency and Critical Care Center of Hitachi General Hospital. The subjects were patients whose status epilepticus was successfully stopped by diazepam, and in whom FPHT or LEV was administered after diazepam. As LEV injections recently became clinically available in Japan, the choice of drug was determined by the treatment period. Thus, 21 patients who were intravenously injected with LEV as a second-line therapy and 42 matched patients (historical controls) who were treated with FPHT (1:2) were selected.The subjects had a mean age of 64.0\u200a\u00b1\u200a2.2 years, and included 48 males and 15 females. The status epilepticus control rates of the FPHT and LEV groups did not differ significantly (81.0% [34/42] vs 85.1% [18/21], respectively; P\u200a = \u200a.69). As for serious adverse events, a reduction in blood pressure was observed in the FPHT group, but not in the LEV group. The oral anticonvulsant switching rates of the 2 groups were similar, but the same-drug switching rates of the FPHT and LEV groups were 8.1% and 77.8%, respectively.The efficacy of intravenous LEV injections after status epilepticus was equivalent to that of FPHT, and the incidence of adverse events was lower in the LEV group. LEV is effective and safe at preventing recurrent seizures after status epilepticus following benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "1": "This study aimed to investigate the clinical effectiveness of dexmedetomidine and midazolam for sedation of intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB).This retrospective cohort study included 148 patients from the third ICU ward of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University (Harbin, China) who received simultaneous invasive mechanical ventilation and FFB between March 2012 and December 2014. Patients were divided into dexmedetomidine (n\u200a = \u200a72) and midazolam (n\u200a = \u200a76) groups according to sedative mode. The sedative effects, incidence of adverse events, and bronchoscopist satisfaction scores were compared between groups.During FFB, total sedation time and total time of FFB were significantly shorter in the midazolam group (P\u200a<\u200a.001, respectively), with a lower percentage of these patients requiring propofol for remedial sedation (P\u200a<\u200a.001). The incidence of FFB-related adverse events (including bronchospasm, cough, and decreased oxygen saturation) was significantly higher in dexmedetomidine group compared with midazolam group (P\u200a = \u200a.007, .014 and .008, respectively). However, the incidence of other adverse events was not significantly different between groups. In addition, bronchoscopist satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the midazolam compared with dexmedetomidine group (7.72\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.65 vs 7.08\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.77; P\u200a = \u200a.030).For sedation of ICU patients during FFB, combination of midazolam and dexmedetomidine demonstrated an enhanced sedative effect, lower incidence of adverse events, and higher bronchoscopist satisfaction score compared with dexmedetomidine alone, thus represents a suitable alternative sedative for FFB patients.", 
    "2": "Thyroid carcinoma is the first cancer found in general population and the second diagnosed during pregnancy following the breast one. Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to thyroid malignancy in pregnant women pose several and serious issues to the physicians. Even if there is no consensus about the surgical treatment of thyroid carcinomas during pregnancy, a large number of women undergo surgery over the world. The best surgical and anesthesiological treatment should be chosen after reaching a consensus between surgeons, anesthesiologists, obstetrics, and the patients. From 2000 to 2016, 18 pregnant patients underwent thyroidectomy under local anesthesia (cervical plexus block) combined with conscious sedation using benzodiazepines and opiates with ultrashort duration of action. Our 15-year experience on the thyroidectomies performed using the cervical plexus block combined with conscious sedation confirms that this combined technique offers a safe chance to defeat cancer also during pregnancy. Application of hypnosis could be an interesting alternative approach to pharmacological sedation in patients who would avoid intravenous drugs.",

The present case suggests that psychoactive drugs have both positive and negative effects on treating Meige syndrome. As for the patients who also have emotion disorder, their conditions should be observed carefully when choosing which psychoactive drug to use.

    "46": "The benzodiazepine midazolam is widely used in critical care medicine. Midazolam has a clinically active metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam. The contribution of 1-hydroxymidazolam to the effects of midazolam is controversial. The aim of the current study was to compare the actions of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam on network activity of cortical neurons. Midazolam depressed neuronal activity at a low concentration of 5\u2009nM. When midazolam concentration was increased, it depressed neuronal discharge rates in a biphasic manner. In comparison, 1-hydroxymidazolam did not depress the cortical network activity at low nanomolar concentrations. Higher concentrations of 1-hydroxymidazolam consistently inhibited neuronal activity. Moreover, midazolam shortened cortical up states at low, but not at high concentrations, while the opposite effect was observed with 1-hydroxymidazolam. The network depressant action of midazolam at low concentrations was absent in slices from GABAA receptor \u03b11(H101R)mutant mice. The \u03b11(H101R)mutation renders \u03b11-subunit containing GABAA receptors insensitive towards benzodiazepines. This GABAA receptor subtype is thought to mediate sedation. As midazolam is more potent than its metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam, the major clinical effects are thus likely caused by midazolam itself. However, 1-hydroxymidazolam could add to the effects of midazolam, especially after the application of high doses of midazolam, and in case of impaired drug metabolism.",

These complications cover the entire range of body systems, most notably CNS to cardiovascular. They can\u00a0be acute or chronic in nature, but all lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality.

    "63": "Endozepines are endogenous ligands for the benzodiazepine receptors and also target a still unidentified GPCR. The endozepine octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), an endoproteolytic processing product of the diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) was recently shown to be involved in food intake control as an anorexigenic factor through ODN-GPCR signaling and mobilization of the melanocortinergic signaling pathway. Within the hypothalamus, the DBI gene is mainly expressed by non-neuronal cells such as ependymocytes, tanycytes, and protoplasmic astrocytes, at levels depending on the nutritional status. Administration of ODN C-terminal octapeptide (OP) in the arcuate nucleus strongly reduces food intake. Up to now, the relevance of extrahypothalamic targets for endozepine signaling-mediated anorexia has been largely ignored. We focused our study on the dorsal vagal complex located in the caudal brainstem. This structure is strongly involved in the homeostatic control of food intake and comprises structural similarities with the hypothalamus. In particular, a circumventricular organ, the area postrema (AP) and a tanycyte-like cells forming barrier between the AP and the adjacent nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) are present. We show here that DBI is highly expressed by ependymocytes lining the fourth ventricle, tanycytes-like cells, as well as by proteoplasmic astrocytes located in the vicinity of AP/NTS interface. ODN staining observed at the electron microscopic level reveals that ODN-expressing tanycyte-like cells and protoplasmic astrocytes are sometimes found in close apposition to neuronal elements such as dendritic profiles or axon terminals. Intracerebroventricular injection of ODN or OP in the fourth ventricle triggers c-Fos activation in the dorsal vagal complex and strongly reduces food intake. We also show that, similarly to leptin, ODN inhibits the swallowing reflex when microinjected into the swallowing pattern generator located in the NTS. In conclusion, we hypothesized that ODN expressing cells located at the AP/NTS interface could release ODN and modify excitability of NTS neurocircuitries involved in food intake control.", 
    "64": "Catatonia is a cluster of motor features that appears in many recognized psychiatric illnesses, that according to the DSM-5 it is not linked as a subtype to schizophrenia anymore. The classic signs are mutism, a rigid posture, fixed staring, stereotypic movements, and stupor, which are all part of a broad psychopathology that may be found in affective, thought, neurological, toxic, metabolic and immunological disorders. Despite the many etiologies, catatonia may be a life-threatening condition with a specific treatment. Benzodiazepines are the first line therapeutic option for catatonia, being lorazepam the first-choice drug. Eighty percent of the patients are relieved by the use of barbiturates or benzodiazepines, while in those who fail, an improvement is achieved by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). With more than 60years of use in catatonic patients, ECT has proven to be an effective and safe tool for the treatment of this frequent and sometimes forgotten syndrome.",

The long-term use of BZDs is limited due to adverse effects such as tolerance, dependence, withdrawal effects, and impairments in cognition and learning. Additionally, clinical reports have shown that chronic BZD treatment increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Unusual GABAA-R subunit expression and GABAA-R phosphorylation are induced by chronic BZD use. However, the gene expression and signaling pathways related to these effects are not completely understood. In this study, we performed a microarray analysis to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effect of chronic BZD administration on gene expression. Diazepam (DZP, a BZD) was chronically administered, and whole transcripts in the brain were analyzed. We found that the mRNA expression levels were significantly affected by chronic DZP administration and that lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) mRNA was the most upregulated gene in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Lcn2 is known as an iron homeostasis-associated protein. Immunostained signals of Lcn2 were detected in neuron, astrocyte, microglia, and Lcn2 protein expression levels were consistently upregulated. This upregulation was observed without proinflammatory genes upregulation, and was attenuated by chronic treatment of deferoxamine mesylate (DFO), iron chelator. Our results suggest that chronic DZP administration regulates transcription and upregulates Lcn2 expression levels without an inflammatory response in the mouse brain. Furthermore, the DZP-induced upregulation of Lcn2 expression was influenced by ambient iron.", 
    "99": "BACKGROUND Benzodiazepines are the most popular premedication drugs thought to act through the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex and alprazolam is one of the most potent benzodiazepines that have a quick onset. While there is a growing body of evidence supporting alprazolam in the amelioration of redox status in animals, no study has been performed concerning its antioxidant activity in humans. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of alprazolam on redox status. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study was a four-group randomized controlled trial. Participants were recruited from Acibadem University Acibadem International Hospital and included a convenience sample of 82 donors and recipients undergoing renal transplantation. Patients were randomly divided into four groups. While donors and recipients in experimental groups (G1 and G3) were administered alprazolam 0.5 mg orally one hour before the operation, those in control groups (G2 and G4) were not. Serum advanced oxidative protein products, total thiol, free hemoglobin, ischemic modified albumin, and sialic acid levels at different time points were measured to evaluate the redox status. RESULTS All oxidative stress parameters were higher in the alprazolam premedication groups (G1, G3) at all time points than in the control groups (G2, G4). Basal values of oxidative parameters (at time point T1) in patients with CKD (G3, G4) were lower than in healthy donors (G1, G2). CONCLUSIONS Alprazolam premedication in donors and end-stage renal failure patients undergoing renal transplantation does not improve redox homeostasis but further experimental studies are needed.",

Anxiety score, sedation score, blood pressure, heart rate and psychomotor performance were measured on the evening before surgery and on the day of surgery. Additional tests of psychomotor performance were performed in the postanesthesia care unit and on the next day of surgery. The occurrence of amnesia, bispectral index (BIS), recovery profiles and patient satisfaction with overall anesthesia care were also evaluated.", 
    "133": "Changes in the anxiety and sedation scores on the day of surgery were not significantly different among groups, whereas the increases in systolic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly less in both triazolam groups. The triazolam groups both showed a higher incidence of high satisfaction scores (\u2265 2). The two triazolam groups also showed similar outcomes, except for a dose-dependent increase in the number of patients with amnesia and BIS values < 90. Delayed recovery from general anesthesia and psychomotor impairment were not observed in the triazolam groups.", 
    "134": "Triazolam 0.25 mg or 0.375 mg reduced the hemodynamic changes associated with anxiety, produced potent amnesia, and improved patient satisfaction. We suggest that triazolam can be used effectively as anesthetic premedication in adults.", 
    "135": "Lavender essential oil is traditionally used and approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as herbal medicine to relieve stress and anxiety. Some animal and clinical studies reveal positive results in models of anxiety and depression although very little research has been done on molecular mechanisms. Our work consisted of evaluating the effects of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) essential oil on central nervous system well-established targets, such as MAO-A, SERT, GABAAand NMDA receptors as well as in vitro models of neurotoxicity. The results showed that lavender essential oil and its main components exert affinity for the glutamate NMDA-receptor in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 0.04 \u03bcl/mL for lavender oil. In addition, lavender and linalool were also able to bind the serotonin transporter (SERT) whereas they did not show affinity for GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor. In three different models of neurotoxicity, lavender did not enhance the neurotoxic insult and improved viability of SH-SY5Y cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. According to our data, the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects attributed to lavender may be due to an antagonism on the NMDA-receptor and inhibition of SERT. This study suggests that lavender essential oil may exert pharmacological properties via modulating the NMDA receptor, the SERT as well as neurotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide.",

Its clinical management can be challenging especially in cases with poor response to benzodiazepines. Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist acting predominantly in the locus coeruleus, exerts sedative effects without causing relevant respiratory depression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that aimed to assess the impact of dexmedetomidine use with S-ketamine anesthesia on PIA reduction in ECT.",

In 101 sessions, the patients received dexmedetomidine in combination with S-ketamine anesthesia. The decision for dexmedetomidine use was based on individual clinical presentation (patients with positive PIA history). A multivariate repeated measurement logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of dexmedetomidine use on the occurrence of PIA. We hypothesized that the use of dexmedetomidine reduced the incidence of PIA also in combination with S-ketamine anesthesia.", 
    "138": "The prevalence of PIA in ECT sessions with dexmedetomidine administration was lower (mean per patient, 34% vs 62%). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the use of dexmedetomidine predicted the non-occurrence of PIA in a highly significant manner (P=0.001, z=-3.83, odds ratio =0.011-0.303).",

    "140": "Benzodiazepines are a widely prescribed psychoactive drug; in the U.S., both medical and nonmedical use of benzodiazepines has increased markedly in the past 15 years. Long-term use can lead to tolerance and dependence, and abrupt withdrawal can cause seizures or other life-threatening symptoms. Benzodiazepines are often used nonmedically in conjunction with other drugs, and with opioids in particular-a combination that can increase the risk for fatal and non-fatal overdose. This mixed-methods study examines nonmedical use of benzodiazepines among young adults in New York City and its relationship with opioid use.", 
    "141": "For qualitative analysis, 46 90-minute semi-structured interviews were conducted with young adult opioid users (ages 18-32). Interviews were transcribed and coded for key themes. For quantitative analysis, 464 young adult opioid users (ages 18-29) were recruited using Respondent-Driven Sampling and completed structured interviews. Benzodiazepine use was assessed via a self-report questionnaire that included measures related to nonmedical benzodiazepine and opioid use.", 
    "142": "Participants reported using benzodiazepines nonmedically for a wide variety of reasons, including: to increase the high of other drugs; to lessen withdrawal symptoms; and to come down from other drugs. Benzodiazepines were described as readily available and cheap. There was a high prevalence (93%) of nonmedical benzodiazepine use among nonmedical opioid users, with 57% reporting regular nonmedical use. In bivariate analyses, drug-related risk behaviours such as polysubstance use, drug binging, heroin injection and overdose were strongly associated with regular nonmedical benzodiazepine use. In multivariate analysis, growing up in a middle-income household (earning between $51,000 and $100,000 annually), lifetime overdose experience, having ever used cocaine regularly, having ever been prescribed benzodiazepines, recent drug binging, and encouraging fellow drug users to use benzodiazepines to cope with opioid withdrawal were consistently strong predictors of regular nonmedical benzodiazepine use.", 
    "143": "Nonmedical benzodiazepine use may be common among nonmedical opioid users due to its drug-related multi-functionality. Harm reduction messages should account for the multiple functions benzodiazepines serve in a drug-using context, and encourage drug users to tailor their endorsement of benzodiazepines to peers to include safer alternatives.",

However, these quick and advantageous tools also present disadvantages, including low-reliability measures in comparison to chromatographic assays. Therefore, this article presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the reliability of measurements of PAS detection in oral fluid using POCT devices. The reliability measures for detection of the five most important drug classes - cocaine, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids and opioids, are reported. The article also presents a subgroup analysis considering the reliability estimates for the different POCT devices that were evaluated by the studies contemplated in the review. A discussion considering the strengths and limitations of POCT techniques was performed in order to guide policymakers, traffic agents and other professionals who also conduct such tests. The use of POCT devices often involves legal and moral aspects of the subjects tested, which demands critical evaluation of these devices before they are implemented in different settings.",

These patients often require acute care and inpatient treatment for refractory emesis, electrolyte derangement, dehydration, acute renal failure, and injury to the upper gastrointestinal tract. Routinely-prescribed antiemetics are frequently associated with treatment failure in CHS, necessitating use of sedating agents such as benzodiazepines and antipsychotics. Hydrotherapy with hot water provides short-term symptomatic relief from acute episodes of CHS. The reasons for this may be from chronic and/or excessive cannabis use leading to abnormal stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in CHS patients. Overuse of cannabis may also lead to dysfunction of the endocannabinoid system, which is essential for allostasis of the autonomic nervous system after stress.",

Drug-DNA interaction studies are of great significance as it helps in the development of new therapeutic drugs. It provides a deeper understanding into the mechanism through which therapeutic drugs control gene expression. Interaction of pirenzepine with calf-thymus DNA (Ct-DNA) was determined via a series of biophysical techniques. UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed the formation of pirenzepine-Ct-DNA complex. The values of binding constant from various experiments were calculated to be in the order of 10(3)\u00a0M(-1) which is consistent with the groove binding mode. Various spectrofluorimetric experiments like competitive displacement of well known dyes with drug, iodide quenching experiments and the effect of Ct-DNA denaturation in presence of drug confirmed the binding of pirenzepine to the groove of Ct-DNA. The binding mode was further established by viscometric, circular dichroic and molecular modelling studies. Thermodynamic parameters obtained from isothermal titration calorimetric studies suggest that the interaction of pirenzepine with Ct-DNA is enthalpically driven. The value of T\u0394S and \u0394H calculated from calorimetric studies were found to be 4.3\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol(-1) and -2.54\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol(-1) respectively, indicating that pirenzepine-Ct-DNA complex is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding. The binding energy calculated was\u00a0-7.5\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol(-1) from modelling studies which was approximately similar to that obtained by isothermal titration calorimetric studies.

Stability was assessed by measuring the percent recovery at varying time points throughout a 90-day period. Active pharmaceutical ingredients quantification was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography via a stability-indicating method. Given the percentage of recovery of the active pharmaceutical ingredients within the suspensions, the beyond-use date of the final products (active pharmaceutical ingredients + vehicle) was at least 90 days for all suspensions with regard to both temperatures.

For those compounds that showed a significant degradation, i.e. diazepam, oxazepam and nordazepam, parameters affecting to the reaction kinetics (pH, chlorine and bromide level) were studied in detail and transformation products were tentatively identified. The oxidation reactions followed pseudofirst-order kinetics with rate constants in the range of 1.8-42.5\u00a0M(-1)\u00a0s(-1), 0.13-1.16\u00a0M(-1)\u00a0s(-1) and 0.04-20.4\u00a0M(-1)\u00a0s(-1) corresponding to half-life values in the range of 1.9-146\u00a0min, 1.8-87\u00a0h and 2.5-637\u00a0h for oxazepam, nordazepam and diazepam, respectively, depending of the levels of studied parameters. Chlorine and pH affected significantly the reaction kinetics, where an increase of the pH resulted into a decrease of the reaction rate, whereas higher chlorine dosages led to faster kinetics, as expected in this case. The transformation of the studied benzodiazepines occurs mainly at the 1,4-diazepine 7-membered-ring, resulting in ring opening to form benzophenone derivatives or the formation of a 6-membered pyrimidine ring, leading to quinazoline derivatives. The formation of these by-products was also tested in real surface water samples observing kinetics of oxazepam degradation slower in river than in creek water, while the degradation of the two other benzodiazepines occurred only in the simpler sample (creek water). Finally, the acute and chronical toxicity and mutagenicity of precursors and transformation products were estimated using quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) software tools: Ecological Structure Activity Relationships (ECOSAR) and Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (TEST), finding that some transformation products could be more toxic/mutagenic than the precursor drug, but additional test would be needed to confirm this fact.",

Analytes include pharmaceutical and illicit agents from opiate and opioid agonist, opiate-antagonist, benzodiazepine, amphetamine, designer amphetamine, cathinone, cocaine, hallucinogen, gabapentinoid and sedative drug classes. Using a 96-well plate format, the protocol employs glucuronidase hydrolysis, 27-fold urine dilution and a 3 min UPLC-MS-MS acquisition. Subsequent data management includes calculation of a normalized TAC ratio response and weighted least squares calibration. The method utilizes analyte-specific calibration ranges from 2.5 to 1,500 ng/mL with quality control (QC) monitoring of transition-ion ratio, calibrator re-analysis, injection precision and multi-level QC analysis. Method precision, bias, calibration linearity, detection limit, carryover, crossover studies and external proficiency performance were evaluated based on pre-established criteria.

BZDs increase the risk of falling when used either as monotherapy or in combined therapies. It is preferable to use short-acting BZDs, to avoid cumulative effects over time predisposing to falls. A high proportion of falls in older adults are related to the use of BZDs. They should be prescribed to older patients in accordance with current clinical guidelines and reviewed over time. BZDs should be prescribed as a short-term therapy and progressively withdrawn. Short-acting BZDs should be the treatment of choice.", 
    "257": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) are relatively safe when administered alone. However, these drugs can produce severe side effects when coadministered with ethanol. Despite these adverse consequences, rates of concurrent BZ and ethanol misuse are increasing, and it is unclear whether this behavior is maintained by an enhanced reinforcing effect of the mixture. To address this issue, the current study compared the reinforcing effectiveness of sucrose solutions mixed with midazolam, ethanol, or both. Eight male rats were trained to orally self-administer solutions of either sucrose (S), sucrose+midazolam (SM), sucrose+ethanol (SE), or sucrose+midazolam+ethanol (SME). The response requirement was increased between sessions until the number of reinforcers earned was zero and the relationship between response requirement and reinforcers earned was analyzed using the exponential model of demand. Although baseline intake was similar across drug conditions, consumption of SM was least affected by increases in cost, indicating that it possessed the highest reinforcing effectiveness (i.e. least elastic). The reinforcing effectiveness of S, SE, and SME did not differ significantly. The finding that the reinforcing effectiveness of the SME was less than that of SM does not support the supposition that BZ and ethanol coadministration is maintained by a higher reinforcing effectiveness of the mixture.", 
    "258": "Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is a risk factor for motor vehicle accidents (MVAs). This issue has become an increasing concern for the governments of many European and North American countries, thereby encouraging the adoption of preventive policies. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between major clinical outcomes and alcohol or drug abuse among drivers involved in MVAs who were referred to an Italian Emergency Department.", 
    "259": "The study population consisted of consecutive injured drivers who were admitted to the Emergency Department following an MVA during a period of one year. The patients' blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and the presence of the most common drugs of abuse [amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), barbiturates, benzodiazepines, benzoylecgonine (cocaine main metabolite), cannabinoids, methadone, and opiates)] were determined and evaluated in association with major clinical outcomes and demographic data.", 
    "260": "Overall, 347 injured drivers were enrolled. Of the 347 enrolled patients, 164 (47.3%) had a positive BAC (greater than 5 mg/dL). A subgroup of 107 injured drivers was also screened for drugs of abuse. Thirty-seven of these subjects (34.5%) were positive for at least one drug. A statistically significant association was found between BAC and triage at admission (p<0.01), hospitalization (p<0.01), and lesions of internal organs (p=0.04).", 
    "261": "The results of this study show that a significant proportion of injured drivers had detectable levels of BAC and/or illegal drugs. Positive BACs were significantly associated with worse clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that the implementation of methods to prevent alcohol and drug abuse is of paramount importance in the effort to reduce the rates of MVAs and their dramatic consequences.", 
    "262": "To synthesize the available evidence focusing on morbidities in pediatric survivors of critical illness that fall within the defined construct of postintensive care syndrome (PICS) in adults, including physical, neurocognitive and psychological morbidities.", 
    "263": "A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and CINAHL using controlled vocabulary and key word terms to identify studies reporting characteristics of PICS in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients. Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts and performed data extraction. From the 3176 articles identified in the search, 252 abstracts were identified for full text review and nineteen were identified for inclusion in the review. All studies reporting characteristics of PICS in PICU patients were included in the final synthesis.", 
    "264": "Nineteen studies meeting inclusion criteria published between 1995 and 2016 were identified and categorized into studies reporting morbidities in each of three categories-physical, neurocognitive and psychological. The majority of included articles reported prospective cohort studies, and there was significant variability in the outcome measures utilized. A synthesis of the studies indicate that morbidities encompassing PICS are well-described in children who have survived critical illness, often resolving over time. Risk factors for development of these morbidities include younger age, lower socioeconomic status, increased number of invasive procedures or interventions, type of illness, and increased benzodiazepine and narcotic administration.", 
    "265": "PICS-related morbidities impact a significant proportion of children discharged from PICUs. In order to further define PICS in children, more research is needed using standardized tools to better understand the scope and natural history of morbidities after hospital discharge. Improving our understanding of physical, neurocognitive, and psychological morbidities after critical illness in the pediatric population is imperative for designing interventions to improve long-term outcomes in PICU patients.", 
    "266": "The title compound, C17H12BrN3O2, was unexpectedly isolated during an attempt to synthesize pyridodiazepinediones and identified as an oxazolonaphthyridinone derivative. The almost planar oxazolonaphthyridinone ring (r.m.s. deviation = 0.016\u2005\u00c5) makes a dihedral angle of 61.6\u2005(2)\u00b0 with the phenyl ring. In the crystal, columns of mol-ecules stacked along the a axis are formed by \u03c0-\u03c0 inter-actions between the six-membered rings of the oxazolonaphthyridone moieties [centroid-to-centroid distances = 3.494\u2005(2)-3.906\u2005(3)\u2005\u00c5], which further inter-act through C-H\u22ef\u03c0 contacts with the phenyl rings.", 
    "267": "The title compound, C11H12N2, is not planar due to the folding of the seven-membered ring. In the crystal, mol-ecules are packed opposite each other to minimize the electronic repulsion but the long inter-molecular distances indicate that no directional contacts are found.", 
    "268": "Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is commonly characterized by a triad of features including multiple seizure types, intellectual disability or regression. LGS type of seizures is epilepsy which is due to abnormal vibrations occurring in seizures. During the time of such abnormal vibrations, both the seizures and the lungs suffer a lack in oxygen content to a considerable extent. This results in prolonged vibrations and loses of nervous control. As a neuro-lung protective strategy, a novel attempt has been made to enrich both seizures and lungs with oxygen content through the support of Perfluorodecalin (an excellent oxygen carrier) C10F18 (PFD) and Perfluorohexane C6F14 (PFH) along with an enhancement in the antiepileptic activity by the two chosen antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Benzodiazepine (BDZ). Perfluorodecalin C10F18 (PFD) and Perfluorohexane C6F14 (PFH) emulsions were prepared by sonication process with combination of nonionic emulsifier, Lecithin (l-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine) as a surfactant in Aqueous phase medium. These emulsions were mixed with Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Benzodiazepine (BDZ) drugs maintained at a temperature of about -20\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C and were set to slow evaporation process. The products are subjected to Optical microscope, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) - Energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). Study reveals the co-existence of fluorine and drug ensuring the oxygen uptake by the drug. Morphology of TEM, Optical microscopic images and the particle diameter estimated through Image_J confirms this analysis.", 
    "269": "GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are a class of ligand-gated ion channels with high physiological and therapeutic significance. In the brain, these pentameric receptors occur with diverse subunit composition, which confers highly complex pharmacology to this receptor class. An impressive range of clinically used therapeutics are known to bind to distinct sites found on GABAARs to modulate receptor function. Numerous experimental approaches have been used over the years to elucidate the binding sites of these drugs, but unequivocal identification is challenging due to subtype- and ligand-dependent pharmacology. Here, we review the current structural and pharmacological understanding of GABAARs, besides highlighting recent evidence which has revealed greater complexity than previously anticipated.", 
    "270": "Status Epilepticus (SE) is a common medical emergency carrying a high morbidity and mortality. Levetiracetam (LEV) is a novel anticonvulsant effective against varied seizures. Few prospective studies have addressed its use in SE. We aimed to examine the efficacy of intravenous LEV in controlling SE and cluster attacks of seizures (CS), in comparison with IV phenytoin (DPH), using a prospective, randomized study design.", 
    "271": "Adult patients with SE or CS, following an initial dose of IV benzodiazepine to control ongoing seizure, were randomized to receive either medication. Rates of seizure control over 24h, adverse effects and outcomes were compared. A logistic regression model was used to identify outcome predictors.", 
    "272": "52 patients with SE and 63 with CS received either LEV or DPH. In the SE group, LEV was effective in18/22(82%) and DPH in 22/30(73.3%) patients in controlling seizures. Among patients with CS, LEV was effective in 31/38(81.6%) and DPH in 20/25(80%). With the use of LEV, DPH or both, SE and CS were controlled among 92% and 96% of patients respectively. Adverse events included hypotension (in 2 on DPH) and transient agitation (2 on LEV).", 
    "273": "IV Levetiracetam controls status epilepticus or cluster seizures with an efficacy comparable to that of phenytoin. Use of these two agents consecutively may control >90% of all such conditions without resort to anaesthetic agents. Further studies should explore its efficacy in larger cohorts of epileptic emergencies."
