During session A, volunteers received midazolam 0.035 to 0.05 mg x kg(-1) IV for 1 minute followed by an infusion of 0.035 to 0.05 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 59 minutes. During session B, in addition to this midazolam infusion scheme, a target-controlled infusion of propofol (constant C(T): 0.6 or 1.0 microg x mL(-1)) was given from 15 minutes before the start until 6 hours after termination of the midazolam infusion. Arterial blood samples for propofol and midazolam concentration analysis were taken until 6 hours after termination of the midazolam infusion.

    "11": "Although being a relatively old phenomenon, drug-facilitated crime has been well described over the past 20 years as being the administration without the knowledge of the victim of a psychoactive substance in criminal purposes (rape, robbery, theft, money extortion, even murder). Drug-facilitated crime involves also mistreatment of older people or children treated by their parents in order to obtain sedation. Drug-facilitated crimes are often difficult to solve mainly due to analytical issues. Since 10 years, we developed and improved specific methods using LC-MS/MS (benzodiazepines, neuroleptics) and GC-MS/MS (GHB, cannabis) to detect the drugs involved in such crimes. After the intake of a low dosage of a particular drug, those methods allow to detect the analyte of interest up to 3-5 days in blood, 10-15 days in urine, and more than 1 year in hair. In drug-facilitated crime cases, blood and urine are frequently collected too late, more than 12 h after the drug intake and in some cases with a delay greater than 48 h after the event. Thus, the most used molecules are undetectable by the techniques classically used in a laboratory of biology. Moreover, a \"good\" compound that can be used to commit a drug-facilitated crime usually possesses a short elimination half-life and amnesic properties, so that the victim is less able to accurately recall the circumstances under which the offence occurred. The recent progress in analytical toxicology, particularly for laboratories working in the field of forensic toxicology, permits to elucidate many cases of drug-facilitated crimes. Heaven to the introduction of the sequential analysis of hair and the use of sophisticated analytical techniques such as tandem mass-spectrometry for the toxicologist to bring the scientific proof to the applicant authorities in the description of the criminal act and to confuse the offender.

    "12": "Midazolam is an ultra short acting benzodiazepine derivative and a specific probe for phenotyping cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A4/5 activity. A rapid, sensitive, and selective LC-MS/MS method was developed for simultaneous quantitation of midazolam and its metabolites (1'-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam). Deuterated (D5) analog of midazolam was utilized as an internal standard. Sample preparation either from human plasma (100 microL) or liver microsomal incubations involved a simple protein precipitation using acetonitrile (900 microL) with an average recovery of >90% for all compounds. The chromatographic separation was achieved using Zorbax-SB Phenyl, Rapid Resolution HT (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 3.5 microm) and a gradient elution with 10 mM ammonium acetate in 10% methanol (A) and acetonitrile (B). The flow rate was 0.25 mL/min and total run time was 5.5 min. Calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.100-250 ng/mL. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 0.1 ng/mL for all three analytes. The accuracy and precision, estimated at LLOQ and three concentration levels of quality control samples in six replicates, were within 85-115%. In conclusion, a robust, simple and highly sensitive analytical method was developed and validated for the analysis of midazolam and its metabolites. This method is suitable for characterizing the P450 3A4/5 activity in vitro or in human pharmacokinetic studies allowing administration of smaller doses of midazolam.",

The presence of pesticides was investigated in liver or stomach content samples by thin-layer chromatography; amphetamines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, tetra-hydro-cannabinol (THC), cocaine and opioids were analyzed in urine samples by immunoassay. A total of 8736 exams were performed, of which 21.7% tested positive for at least one compound investigated. Men were involved in over 90% of positive cases; most individuals were between the ages of 18 and 30. Alcohol was detected in 47.4% of the blood samples, with over 30% presenting BAC levels higher than 1g/L. Cocaine was present in 21.6%, and THC in 17.5% of the urine samples analyzed. Pesticides were found in 13.3% of the 188 cases investigated, mostly aldicarb, which is the main component of chumbinho, an illegal rodenticide available in the country. Among pharmaceutical drugs, benzodiazepines were the most detected, with 29 samples testing positive (4.6% of the samples analyzed). Most of the individuals who died from traumatism or hypovolemia tested positive for alcohol. Death from intoxication/poisoning corresponded to 1.8% of all positive cases, mainly from the ingestion of pesticides.

It is characterized by mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular hyperactivity. Most reported cases of serotonin syndrome are in patients using multiple serotonergic drugs or who have had considerable exposure to a single serotonin-augmenting drug. Diagnosis is made using the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria, which require the presence of one of the following classical features or groups of features: spontaneous clonus; inducible clonus with agitation or diaphoresis; ocular clonus with agitation or diaphoresis; tremor and hyperreflexia; or hypertonia, temperature above 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C), and ocular or inducible clonus. Most cases of serotonin syndrome are mild and may be treated by withdrawal of the offending agent and supportive care. Benzodiazepines may be used to treat agitation and tremor. Cyproheptadine may be used as an antidote. Patients with moderate or severe cases of serotonin syndrome require hospitalization. Critically ill patients may require neuromuscular paralysis, sedation, and intubation. If serotonin syndrome is recognized and complications are managed appropriately, the prognosis is favorable.",

Often the interactions between large proteins are mediated by small protein secondary structural domains, which project a minimum number of specifically arranged residues into the complementary surface of an interacting protein. Nature has the advantage of time, and over time has optimized those secondary structures, such as alpha-helices, beta-sheets and beta-strands, found at the interfaces of PPIs. Inspired by Nature's extensive optimization, chemists have used these secondary structures as templates in the design of small molecules that may act as structural and functional mimics of large rhenylogically organized protein secondary structures.

Clinically, benzodiazepines are reported to lose anticonvulsant effectiveness the greater the delay between seizure onset and benzodiazepine treatment. This time-dependent diminished effectiveness of diazepam was tested in the present study. Seizures elicited by the nerve agent, soman, were produced in guinea pigs instrumented to record brain electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity. Different groups of animals were administered 10 mg/kg, intramuscularly, of diazepam at 5, 40, 60, 80, or 160 minutes after the onset of seizure activity. There was a progressive loss in the anticonvulsant efficacy of diazepam as the treatment was delayed after seizure onset, but no differences in the time for diazepam to stop seizures.

    "32": "Clobazam is a 1,5 benzodiazepine available in France since 1975, used in add-on with the other anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of refractory epilepsies of child and adult and for the treatment of anxiety of adult. It is mainly metabolized in desmethylclobazam, or norclobazam, active metabolite, present in a concentration approximately eight times superior to that of the parent drug, but with an activity of the order of 20 to 40% of that of clobazam. Elimination half-life of clobazam is of 18 h while that of norclobazam is from 40 to 50 h. There is a large interindividual variability in the plasma concentrations. Furthermore, clobazam being prescribed in add-on with the other anticonvulsant drugs in resistant epilepsies, concentration-effect relationship is difficult to bring to light, since, in many studies, the patients who did not answer received the highest doses. Adverse reactions are moderated, appearing more often for the highest concentrations; also the phenomenon of tolerance seems more frequent in high concentrations. However, because of the kinetic interactions, a dosage of clobazam and norclobazam can be useful in certain cases. There is no validated therapeutic range, but the usual concentrations are in the range of 100-300 \u03bcg/L for the parent drug and about ten times more for the metabolite. The level of proof of the interest of the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring for this molecule is estimated in: rather useless.", 
    "33": "Clonazepam is a 1-4 benzodiazepine mainly used to treat epilepsy and epileptiform convulsion state. Rapidly absorbed after oral administration, it is widely distributed in the organism and is extensively converted in metabolites, poorly or not active, eliminated mainly in urine (70%) and feces. Elimination half-life is long, around 40 h. In adult and child, several studies showed a concentration-effect relation. Meanwhile, a large inter-individual variability in the dose-concentration relation was observed. A 15-50 \u03bcg/L range of clonazepam blood concentrations appears to be retained as an acceptable target to control a majority of epileptic seizures. The Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) of clonazepam can be considered as possibly useful in case of association with CYP450 inducers or inhibitors, suspicion of poor observance, or toxicity signs.",

Drugs that modulate ion channels have been used in psychiatry for more than a century, and in this review we critically evaluate clinical research that reports the therapeutic effects of drugs acting on GABA(A), voltage-gated Na(+) and voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in pediatric and adult patients. As in other fields, the evidence underpinning the use of medicines in younger people is far less robust than for adults. In addition, we discuss some current developments and highlight clinical disorders in which current molecules could be further tested. Notable success stories, such as benzodiazepines (in sleep and anxiety disorders) and antiepileptics (in bipolar disorder), have been the result of serendipitous discoveries or refinements of serendipitous discoveries, as in all other major treatments in psychiatry. Genomic, high-throughput screening and molecular pharmacology discoveries may, however, guide further developments in the future.

Twenty male participants who were all first-episode drug naive psychotic patients without prominent affective signs and symptoms and 22 healthy male controls of similar age were included. BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and lipid profiles were measured, and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores were obtained at baseline, during the second and sixth week of treatment, and the aforementioned neuropeptide levels were measured at baseline and during the sixth week of treatment. Treatment was associated with significant increases in BMI, waist circumference, serum triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein levels. BMI levels increased more than 7% in over 75% of the patients. Leptin increased, and ghrelin and orexin decreased significantly with olanzapine treatment, whereas cholecystokinin, visfatin, and agouti-related protein levels did not change significantly. In conclusion, consistent with previous studies, we found increased BMI, leptin and lipids during olanzapine treatment. Association of neuropeptide level changes with symptom improvement might be mediated by the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.", 
    "40": "Mitochondria are structurally complex organelles that undergo fragmentation or fission in apoptotic cells. Mitochondrial fission requires the cytoplasmic dynamin-related protein, Drp1, which translocates to the mitochondria during apoptosis and interacts with the mitochondrial protein, Fis1. Finely tuned changes in cellular calcium modulate a variety of intracellular functions; in resting cells, the level of mitochondrial calcium is low, while it is higher during apoptosis. Mitochondria take up Ca(2+) via the Uniporter and extrude it to the cytoplasm through the mitochondrial Na+/Ca(2+) exchanger. Overload of Ca(2+) in the mitochondria leads to their damage, affecting cellular function and survival. The mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was blocked by benzodiazepine, CGP37157 (CGP) leading to increased mitochondrial calcium and enhancing the apoptotic effects of TRAIL, TNFalpha related apoptosis inducing ligand. In the present study, we observed that increasing mitochondrial calcium induced mitochondrial fragmentation, which correlated with the presence of Drp1 at the mitochondria in CGP treated cells. Under these conditions, we observed interactions between Drp1 and Fis1. The importance of Drp1 in fragmentation was confirmed by transfection of dominant negative Drp1 construct. However, fragmentation of the mitochondria was not sufficient to induce apoptosis, although it enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, oligomerization of Bak was partially responsible for the increased apoptosis in cells treated with both CGP and TRAIL. Thus, our results show that combination of an apoptogenic agent and an appropriate calcium channel blocker provide therapeutic advantages.",

Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) analysis of GABA-A receptors binding by (123)I-labelled Iomazenil ((123)I-IMZ) has been applied in some neuropsychiatric disorders to investigate conditions where GABA-A receptor density can be detected in several pathophysiological conditions. In this study we investigate cerebral GABA-A receptor density in a small series of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cognitive impairment characterized by recurrent, episodic memory loss. Nine female patients with SLE and cognitive alterations underwent to a clinical neuropsychiatric evaluation including digital video-EEG, brain MRI, (99m)Tc-ECD brain SPECT and (123)I-IMZ brain SPECT. All patients tested showed diffuse or focal GABA-A receptor density reduction. This is, to our knowledge, the first report on GABA-A receptor density abnormalities associated with cognitive defects in SLE patients. We hypothesize that in our series a decrease in GABA-A receptor density might be related to the neurological manifestations. Further studies are needed to clarify this aspect and the possible mechanisms. GABA-A receptor density impairment might be due to the SLE-related cerebral vasculopathy, or to neuronal-reacting auto-antibodies or drugs which could interfere with GABA-A receptors expression/binding. This study may support the concept that cognitive impairment in systemic lupus erythematosus could be the outcome of fine-tuned neurotransmission alterations.",

CML is one of the best-understood malignancies, as it results from a single genetic mutation, the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL, which has been widely studied. Specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to target BCR-ABL in CML, but these agents fail to eliminate the CML stem cell population and thus are unlikely to cure CML. This article reviews recent developments in the biology and treatment of CML, specifically focusing on CML stem cells.

A number of 'next step' therapeutic options exist in such cases, including switching to an alternative antidepressant, combining antidepressants from different pharmacological classes, adding evidence-supported psychotherapies to ongoing antidepressant treatment and augmentation with a nonantidepressant drug. Augmenting antidepressants with atypical antipsychotic drugs has generated considerable clinical interest. Three atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole, quetiapine and olanzapine) have received regulatory approval for adjunctive use with antidepressants for treatment-resistant major depression (TRD) in adults. Symbyax (olanzapine-fluoxetine combination or OFC), the combination of olanzapine and the selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, is also approved for this indication. The short-term effectiveness of OFC for TRD is supported by results of five published randomized, controlled, acute-phase studies of generally similar design. In each study, OFC was associated with rapid reduction in depressive symptoms. In two studies, significantly greater improvement in depressive symptoms occurred in OFC-treated patients at study end point compared with those who received antidepressant monotherapy. These effects appeared to be strongest in cases where antidepressant failure was established during the current depressive episode. Although OFC was well-tolerated, increases in body weight and prolactin concentration were greater with OFC than antidepressant monotherapy, and were similar to olanzapine monotherapy. Increases in random total cholesterol levels were greatest for OFC, and were significantly greater than those of olanzapine and antidepressant monotherapy. The long-term efficacy and tolerability of OFC for TRD has not been investigated, and the comparative effectiveness of OFC versus other next-step options is unknown. As such, the exact place of OFC among the available therapeutic options for TRD is not fully understood at this time.",

Specifically, a positive neonatal hair test for opioids also predicted a positive result for oxycodone. In addition, a positive meconium test result for opioids was associated with positive results for cocaine, oxycodone, methadone, benzodiazepines, and fatty acid ethyl esters (alcohol). Finally, there was a significant correlation between maternal and neonatal hair test results for opioids (Spearman rank rho = 0.657, P = 0.03).

    "73": "Noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus project throughout the cerebral cortex and multiple subcortical structures. Alterations in the locus coeruleus firing are associated with vigilance states and with fear and anxiety disorders. Brain ionotropic type A receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) serve as targets for anxiolytic and sedative drugs, and play an essential regulatory role in the locus coeruleus. GABA(A) receptors are composed of a variable array of subunits forming heteropentameric chloride channels with different pharmacological properties. The gamma2 subunit is essential for the formation of the binding site for benzodiazepines, allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors that are clinically often used as sedatives/hypnotics and anxiolytics. There are contradictory reports in regard to the gamma2 subunit's expression and participation in the functional GABA(A) receptors in the mammalian locus coeruleus. We report here that the gamma2 subunit is transcribed and participates in the assembly of functional GABA(A) receptors in the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neuromelanin-containing neurons within postmortem human locus coeruleus as demonstrated by in situ hybridization with specific gamma2 subunit oligonucleotides and autoradiographic assay for flumazenil-sensitive [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding to benzodiazepine sites. These sites were also sensitive to the alpha1 subunit-preferring agonist zolpidem. Our data suggest a species difference in the expression profiles of the alpha1 and gamma2 subunits in the locus coeruleus, with the sedation-related benzodiazepine sites being more important in man than rodents. This may explain the repeated failures in the transition of novel drugs with a promising neuropharmacological profile in rodents to human clinical usage, due to intolerable sedative effects.",

    "78": "Antipsychotic drugs are broadly classified into typical and atypical compounds; they vary in their pharmacological profile however a common component is their antagonist effects at the D2 dopamine receptors (DRD2). Unfortunately, diminished DRD2 activation is generally thought to be associated with the severity of neuroleptic-induced anhedonia. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine and typical antipsychotic haloperidol in a paradigm that reflects the learned transfer of incentive motivational properties to previously neutral stimuli, namely autoshaping. In order to provide a dosing comparison to a therapeutically relevant endpoint, both drugs were tested against amphetamine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition as well. In the autoshaping task, rats were exposed to repeated pairings of stimuli that were differentially predictive of reward delivery. Conditioned approach to the reward-predictive cue (sign-tracking) and to the reward (goal-tracking) increased during repeated pairings in the vehicle treated rats. Haloperidol and olanzapine completely abolished this behavior at relatively low doses (100microg/kg). This same dose was the threshold dose for each drug to antagonize the sensorimotor gating deficits produced by amphetamine. At lower doses (3-30microg/kg) both drugs produced a dose-dependent decrease in conditioned approach to the reward-predictive cue. There was no difference between drugs at this dose range which indicates that olanzapine disrupts autoshaping at a significantly lower proposed DRD2 receptor occupancy. Interestingly, neither drug disrupted conditioned approach to the reward at the same dose range that disrupted conditioned approach to the reward-predictive cue. Thus, haloperidol and olanzapine, at doses well below what is considered therapeutically relevant, disrupts the attribution of incentive motivational value to previously neutral cues. Drug effects on this dimension of reward processing are an important consideration in the development of future pharmacological treatments for schizophrenia.",

    "104": "The GABA(A) receptor, a pentamer composed predominantly of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, mediates fast inhibitory synaptic transmission. We have previously reported that phospholipase C-related inactive protein (PRIP) is a modulator of GABA(A) receptor trafficking and that knockout (KO) mice exhibit a diazepam-insensitive phenotype in the hippocampus. The alpha subunit affects diazepam sensitivity; alpha1, 2, 3, and 5 subunits assemble with any form of beta and the gamma2 subunits to produce diazepam-sensitive receptors, whereas alpha4 or alpha6/beta/gamma2 receptors are diazepam-insensitive. Here, we investigated how PRIP is implicated in the diazepam-insensitive phenotype using cerebellar granule cells in animals expressing predominantly the alpha6 subunit. The expression of alpha1/beta/gamma2 diazepam-sensitive receptors was decreased in the PRIP-1 and 2 double KO cerebellum without any change in the total number of benzodiazepine-binding sites as assessed by radioligand-binding assay. Since levels of the alpha6 subunit were increased, the alpha1/beta/gamma2 receptors might be replaced with alpha6 subunit-containing receptors. Then, we further performed autoradiographic and electrophysiologic analyses. These results suggest that the expression of alpha6/delta receptors was decreased in cerebellar granule neurons, while that of alpha6/gamma2 receptors was increased. PRIP-1 and 2 double KO mice exhibit a diazepam-insensitive phenotype because of a decrease in diazepam-sensitive (alpha1/gamma2) and increase in diazepam-insensitive (alpha6/gamma2) GABA(A) receptors in the cerebellar granule cells.", 
    "105": "To assess the effects of midazolam on explicit and implicit memories, 12 volunteers were randomly divided into the two groups: one with an Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score of 3 (mild sedation) and one with a score of 1 (deep sedation). Blood oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging was measured before and during an auditory stimulus, then with midazolam sedation, and then during a second auditory stimulus with continuous midazolam sedation. After 4 h, explicit and implicit memories were assessed. There was no evidence of explicit memory at the two levels of midazolam sedation. Implicit memory was retained at a mild level of midazolam sedation but absent at a deep level of midazolam sedation. At a mild level of midazolam sedation, activation of all brain areas by auditory stimulus (as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging) was uninhibited. However, a deep level of midazolam sedation depressed activation of the superior temporal gyrus by auditory stimulus. We conclude that midazolam does not abolish implicit memory at a mild sedation level, but can abolish both explicit and implicit memories at a deep sedation level. The superior temporal gyrus may be one of the target areas.", 
    "106": "There is considerable interest in the highly parallelized mass spectrometry analysis of complex sample mixtures without any time-consuming prepurification. Porous silicon-based laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (pSi LDI-MS) is enabling technology for such analysis. Previous studies have focused on pSi surface functionalization to enhance sensitivity of detection and engineer surfaces for sample capture and enrichment in LDI-MS analysis. In this report, we build on this work by showing that surface functionalization of thin pSi films can be extended to the covalent immobilization of antibodies, producing a porous immunoaffinity surface. We demonstrate highly selective mass spectrometric detection of illicit drugs (benzodiazepines) on pSi films displaying antibenzodiazepine antibodies covalently immobilized via isocyanate chemistry. The effects of antibody immobilization conditions, antibody concentration, and surface blocking on LDI-MS performance and selectivity were studied. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was instrumental in characterizing surface chemistry and optimizing LDI-MS performance. Overall, our approach is suitable for rapid and sensitive confirmatory analysis in forensic toxicology requiring only minimal sample volume and may be applied to other areas requiring small molecular analysis such as metabolomics and pharmacology.",

No epileptiform discharge appeared with the onset of these REM sleep behaviors. Therapy with clonazepam, 0.5 mg at bedtime (with ongoing 3 mg bedtime and 4.5 mg total daily rivastigmine therapy), fully suppressed the sleep-related events, with prompt relapse whenever clonazepam was not taken.

Using the D3-selective drug SB277011, we found that ex vivo and in vitro [(3)H]-(+)-PHNO binding in STR is exclusively due to D2, whereas that in cerebellar lobes 9 and 10 is exclusively due to D3. Surprisingly, the D3 contribution to [(3)H]-(+)-PHNO binding in the islands of Calleja, ventral pallidum, substantia nigra, and nucleus accumbens was greater ex vivo than in vitro. Ex vivo, systemically administered olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol, at doses occupying approximately 80% D2, did not occupy D3 receptors. Clozapine, which also occupied approximately 80% of D2 receptors ex vivo, occupied a smaller percentage of D3 receptors than predicted by its in vitro pharmacology. Across brain regions, ex vivo occupancy by antipsychotics was inversely related to the D3 contribution to [(3)H]-(+)-PHNO binding. In contrast, in vitro occupancy was similar across brain regions, independent of the regional D3 contribution. These data indicate that at clinically relevant doses, olanzapine, clozapine, risperidone, and haloperidol are D2-selective ex vivo. This unforeseen finding suggests that their clinical effects cannot be attributed to D3 receptor blockade.",

    "110": "This was a descriptive case series of 20 patients, all of whom had been referred to a paediatric visual electrophysiology service because of concerns regarding visual function, and all of whom had been exposed to methadone in utero. All children underwent a full ophthalmic and orthoptic examination as well as visual electrophysiology testing deemed appropriate on an individual basis. A review was undertaken of paediatric case notes and of maternal antenatal urine toxicology.",

Visual electrophysiology was abnormal in 60%. A quarter of the children had associated neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The majority of children with nystagmus (79%) had been treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).",

Those infants with NAS severe enough to receive pharmaceutical treatment may be at particular risk of developing nystagmus. The inclusion of visual electrophysiology in comprehensive visual assessment of children exposed to substance misuse in utero may help clarify the underlying causes by differentiating abnormalities of retinal and cortical origin.",

This increase was double the increase observed in hospitalizations for poisoning by other drugs and substances. The largest increase in the number of hospitalized cases over the 7-year period was seen for poisonings by benzodiazepines, whereas the largest percentage increase was observed for methadone (400%). In comparison to patients hospitalized for poisoning from other substances, those hospitalized for prescription opioids, sedatives, and tranquilizers were more likely to be women, aged >34 years, and to present to a rural or urban nonteaching hospital.",

Clinicians should screen for mental illness when prescribing opioids and recommend psychotherapy as an adjunct or an alternate to pharmacotherapy. Benzodiazepines may have been used nonmedically rather than as a psychotropic drug, reflecting drug diversion. Restricting benzodiazepine prescriptions to a 30-day supply with no refills might be considered.", 
    "122": "At least 3 systematic reviews have assessed the safety of propofol versus traditional agents used for sedation in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures. These reviews uncovered a marked variability in study design and found the quality of the included randomized controlled trials to be poor. To date there is no demonstrated difference in the endoscopic safety or efficacy of propofol sedation compared to sedation with benzodiazepine with or without an opioid. However, a trend towards reduced complications and higher levels of satisfaction and cost-effectiveness with propofol during colonoscopies, and higher levels of patient satisfaction and improved efficacy may also be expected by using propofol during upper gastrointestinal endoscopies.", 
    "123": "During gastrointestinal endoscopy, patients may reach a level of sedation that is deeper (i.e. deep sedation) than intended to be (i.e. moderate sedation). In such cases the ability to restore respiratory and cardiovascular function is critical. Supportive measures should be combined with administration of specific pharmacologic antagonists in cases of imminent ventilatory failure. Naloxone rapidly reverses sedation and respiratory depression due to previously administered narcotics, whereas flumazenil overturns the effects of midazolam on the central nervous system. Both agents are administered intravenously in repeated doses according to the patient's response. Caution, however, is required, as the half-lives of these reversal agents are shorter than those of the respective agonists and re-sedation may occur. Acute withdrawal syndromes may take place in chronic users of opiates or benzodiazepine. Product monographs along with administration protocols may be demonstrated as a wall chart, to ascertain their safe and effective use in endoscopy units.", 
    "124": "Sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopies is obtained by opioids, benzodiazepines, propofol, ketamine and/or droperidol. The pharmacokinetic profile of some sedatives/anesthetics renders them advantageous over others. Opioids, mainly pethidine and fentanyl, are the most popular. Though newer opioids provide a faster recovery, fentanyl is safe and advantageous due to its lower cost. Remifentanil, due to its pharmacokinetic profile (elimination half-life: 9 min), is advantageous for ambulatory patients, though it is not known whether the high cost compensates the benefits. Midazolam is the benzodiazepine of choice as it has a shorter duration of action and a better pharmacokinetic profile than diazepam. Propofol, an intravenous anesthetic, has become very popular for gastrointestinal endoscopies in sedative doses. The opioid and benzodiazepine antagonists, naloxone and flumazenil, are indicated only in particular circumstances, like deep sedation with threatening respiratory depression. Ketamine and droperidol are not popular agents for sedation in the modern endoscopic practice.", 
    "125": "Inhibition of translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) can effectively prevent reperfusion-induced arrhythmias and improve postischemic contractile performance. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, mediated mainly through oxidative stress during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), is a key event in reperfusion injury. 4'-Chlorodiazepam is a widely used TSPO antagonist. However, whether 4'-chlorodiazepam can improve cardiac functional recovery during postischemia reperfusion by affecting oxidative enzymes, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby inhibiting mPTP opening is still unknown. Cardiac function including heart rate, coronary flow rate, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), maximal time derivatives of pressure (+/-dP/dt max) and the severity of ventricular arrhythmias were analyzed in isolated rat hearts during I/R. mPTP opening, ROS and oxidative enzyme activities were measured with fluorometric or spectrophotometric techniques. 4'-Chlorodiazepam did not affect heart rate and coronary flow rate, but abolished the increase in LVEDP, accelerated the recovery of LVDP and +/-dP/dt max, and reduced the severity of ventricular arrhythmias. The mPTP opening probability was reduced by 4'-chlorodiazepam, accompanied by a reduction in ROS level. In addition, the activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I and complex III were increased, while those of xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase were reduced. Therefore, 4'-chlorodiazepam may improve cardiac functional recovery during reperfusion, potentially by affecting the activities of oxidative enzymes, reducing ROS and thereby inhibiting mPTP opening. The present study presents evidence that 4'-chlorodiazepam could be a novel adjunct to reperfusion.",

    "127": "A 2-year-old boy presented to the emergency department after an acute ingestion of up to 43 mg/kg of lamotrigine. He had 2 generalized seizures, with the first occurring 60 minutes after ingestion. Examination revealed alternate drowsiness and irritability, as well as nystagmus and hyperreflexia. Results of electrocardiogram, blood glucose, complete blood count, urea, electrolytes, and venous blood gas evaluations were all within normal limits. There was a mildly raised lactate level of 3.4 mEq/L (reference range 0.7-2.5). He was given intravenous diazepam 1 mg for irritability. After a 12-hour observation period, the patient was discharged with no further complications.",

A MEDLINE search (1966-January 2010) using the search terms lamotrigine, seizures, toxicity, overdose, ingestion, and pediatric/paediatric, not limited to English-language literature, revealed 5 other cases of seizures in children after lamotrigine ingestion. In all the acute cases, time to first seizure onset ranged from 20 to 60 minutes after ingestion. Two children had gastrointestinal decontamination, both after the onset of seizures. All had full recovery with supportive care.",

We describe a 67-year-old woman with acute respiratory failure on mechanical ventilator from pneumonia and anuric acute on chronic renal failure (urea nitrogen 21.4 mmol/L, creatinine 530.4 micromol/L) requiring haemodialysis (HD). On hospital day 5, she was found to have progressive metabolic acidosis (serum pH 7.16, PCO(2) 4.38 kPa, HCO(3)(-) 12.1 mmol/L and AG 21 mmol/L). There was no evidence of hypoxaemia, hypoperfusion or haemodynamic instability. Normal serum ketone and L-lactate but high serum osmolal gap (89.4 mmol/kg) was detected. A search for toxic alcohols revealed a high serum propylene glycol (PG 32.9 mmol/L), a stabilizing solvent for intravenous formulations of lorazepam, which was being used as sedation for mechanical ventilation. Unexpectedly, serum L- and D-lactate as metabolites of PG were not elevated. Although extended HD for eight hours completely removed serum PG and the osmolal gap, the predialysis high AG metabolic acidosis persisted, potentially related to hypercatabolism and anuric renal failure. PG should be in the differential diagnosis of the disorders with high osmolar gap and may not always be associated with L- or D-lactic acidosis.",

The Rapid Stat tests (n = 134) were applied by police officers in routine traffic checks. Oral fluid and blood samples were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, and methylenedioxyamphetamine. The comparison of GC-MS analysis of oral fluid with the Rapid Stat results for cannabis showed a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 87%, and a total confirmation rate of 87%. When compared with serum, the sensitivity of the cannabis assay decreased to 71%, the specificity to 60%, and the total confirmation rate to 66%. These findings were possibly caused by an incorrect reading of the THC test results. Comparison of the Rapid Stat amphetamine assay with GC-MS in oral fluid showed a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 97%, and a total confirmation rate of 97%. Compared with serum, a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 90%, and a total confirmation rate of 92% was found. The amphetamine assay must, therefore, be regarded as satisfactory.",

We aim to assess the use of acute drug administration (ADA) in the treatment of 24 patients with epilepsy (9 idiopathic generalized, 14 focal symptomatic/cryptogenic, 1 migraine-epilepsy) receiving ADA for (1) prevention of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) after minor seizures, (2) prevention of seizures at perceived risk, (3) prevention of seizure clusters. Standard ADA was 10 mg oral clobazam (CLB); one patient received 10 mg rectal diazepam. Concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AED) remained unchanged whenever possible. Ten patients used ADA always correctly, 7 mostly, 7 sporadically or not. Outcome considering seizure control was positive in 44% of all patients (59% of those who actually used ADA): 5 patients seizure free, 1 free of disabling seizures, 4 with >50% reduction in seizure frequency. Eleven had minor or no improvement, 3 patients could not be rated. Thirteen (of 19 possible) patients attempted prevention of seizures or clusters, 10 with full or >50% success (52.6 resp. 76.9%). Prevention of clusters sometimes required higher or repetitive CLB dosing. Self rating of patients who did use ADA was positive or very positive in 88.2%. Retention rate was 66.7% of all patients, and 88.2% of those using ADA. The best results were obtained in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) patients with seizures habitually triggered by typical factors (sleep deprival, alcohol) but also some others were successful. The only adverse effect was gait ataxia in a multiple-handicapped patient. ADA is an elegant and often successful but underused treatment option for selected patient groups where it can make the difference between becoming seizure free or not. Depending on the individual case it can be applied as monotherapy or in combination with a basis AED. A controlled investigation should follow.", 
    "133": "Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a common disorder associated with significant distress. We report three cases of drug induced RLS caused by olanzapine. In each case, RLS commenced after initiation of treatment with olanzapine and resolved after ceasing olanzapine. All three patients were subsequently treated with other atypical antipsychotics, risperidone, quetiapine or aripiprazole, without re-emergence of RLS. RLS is associated with central dopaminergic dysfunction. Dopamine agonists and L-dopa reduce the symptoms of RLS, and some agents that block the dopaminergic system aggravate RLS. Greater awareness of potential causes of RLS, and its differentiation from akathisia and illness related agitation might help in reducing the distress associated with it and improving patient compliance.", 
    "134": "Salicylates are common exposures. We report an unusual case of salicylate ingestion, as salsalate, with resolution of symptoms and return of salicylate levels to non-toxic values, with a subsequent, unexpected recrudescence to toxic levels requiring reinstitution of therapy. A 31-year-old man ingested unknown amounts of salsalate, hydroxyzine, and a benzodiazepine. He was intubated and treated with IV sodium bicarbonate and two doses of oral activated charcoal. Eight hours after presentation, his serum salicylate concentration peaked at 55 mg/dL, and then decreased to a nadir of 5.6 mg/dL 38 h after presentation, coinciding with return of GI motility. Several hours later salicylate concentrations began to rise, peaking 67 h after presentation at 61.7 mg/dL. He was treated with sodium bicarbonate and charcoal, which resulted in decreased serum salicylate to therapeutic levels. Salicylate ingestions are known to exhibit unusual toxicokinetics and absorption in overdose; however, this is the first case we are aware of that shows a return to toxic concentrations after apparent resolution of toxicity. Recrudescence of salicylate concentrations to a degree that would dictate reinstitution of therapy for overdose is unusual and may warrant prolonged monitoring of serum salicylate concentrations in salsalate ingestions.", 
    "135": "Bacterial Shiga-like toxins are virulence factors that constitute a significant public health threat worldwide, and the plant toxin ricin is a potential bioterror weapon. To gain access to their cytosolic target, ribosomal RNA, these toxins follow the retrograde transport route from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum, via endosomes and the Golgi apparatus. Here, we used high-throughput screening to identify small molecule inhibitors that protect cells from ricin and Shiga-like toxins. We identified two compounds that selectively block retrograde toxin trafficking at the early endosome-TGN interface, without affecting compartment morphology, endogenous retrograde cargos, or other trafficking steps, demonstrating an unexpected degree of selectivity and lack of toxicity. In mice, one compound clearly protects from lethal nasal exposure to ricin. Our work discovers the first small molecule that shows efficacy against ricin in animal experiments and identifies the retrograde route as a potential therapeutic target.",

Early recognition of the syndrome improve patient's outcome. Propofol infusion must be avoided in susceptible patients and another sedative agent should be considered. When using prolonged sedation with propofol, arrhythmia and serum triglyceridemia level should be monitored.", 
    "162": "The most important change of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) is the use of dimensional approach to assess the severity of symptoms across different diagnosis. There are 2 purposes in this study: the first purpose was to identify the proportion of outpatients with panic disorder who have suicidal ideation. The second aim was to examine the relationships among panic, agoraphobic symptoms, and suicidal ideation in patients with panic disorder, adjusting by age, social support, and alcohol use.", 
    "163": "Sixty patients with panic disorder were recruited from outpatient psychiatric clinics in southern Taiwan. Suicidal ideation in the preceding 2 weeks was measured. The Panic and Agoraphobic Symptoms Checklist, Social Support Scale, Questionnaire for Adverse Effects of Medication for Panic Disorder, and Social Status Rating Scale were used to understand the severity of panic and agoraphobia, social support, drug adverse effects, and social status. Significant variables from the univariate analysis were included in a forward regression model. Then, we used structural equation modeling to fit the model.", 
    "164": "We found that 31.7% of outpatients with panic disorder had had suicidal ideation in the preceding 2 weeks. Multiple regression analysis showed that younger age, current alcohol use, more severe panic symptoms, and less social support were associated with suicidal ideation. In addition, the structural equation model illustrated the recursive model from panic to agoraphobia and suicidal ideation. Agoraphobia had no association with suicidal ideation. Panic symptom was a mediator to suicidal ideation but not agoraphobic symptoms.", 
    "165": "A high proportion of patients with panic disorder had suicidal ideation. We found that panic symptoms, social support, age, and alcohol use affected suicide and could be identified. The 3-level model from panic to agoraphobia revealed that panic was a predictor of agoraphobia and agoraphobia was not a predictor of panic. This verified the evolution of the diagnostic view of the DSM. Panic symptom was a mediator to suicidal ideation. With the dimensional model in DSM-V, panic symptoms can be used as a marker for greater morbidity and severity.", 
    "166": "The in vitro micronucleus assay has been extensively used as an in vitro screening tool to identify test articles that might have aneugenic or clastogenic potential. Currently, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is working towards a final version of the guideline for the conduct of the in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus Test (MNvit). A few questions regarding appropriate cytotoxicity measurements and cytotoxicity limits to use remain to be answered. In order to resolve the remaining questions, we compared the induction of micronuclei at the top dose (50-60% cytotoxicity) determined by either Relative Cell Counts (RCC), Relative Increase in Cell Counts (RICC), Relative Population Doublings (RPD), or Cytokinesis-Blocked Proliferating Index (CBPI) using weak and strong inducers of micronuclei in both the presence and absence of cytochalasin B (CYB) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. In order to assess extensive dose-response relationships, we selected expected weak (diazepam, phenolphthalein, quinacrine dihydrochloride dihydrate) and strong (cytosine arabinoside, mitomycin C, vinblastine sulphate) inducers of micronuclei with a variety of different mechanisms of action for testing. The results clearly demonstrated that all six compounds produced positive responses using either cytotoxicity measurement. The outcome from these studies further supports the cytotoxicity measurements and cytotoxicity limits proposed in the draft OECD guideline.", 
    "167": "The purpose of this study was to examine the neurochemical effects of morphine, diazepam, a common benzodiazepine, and an effluent concentrate on the endemic freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed to the drugs and to the solid-phase concentrate of a municipal effluent and left to stand at 15 degrees C for 48h. Neurochemical effects were determined by monitoring changes in dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the visceral mass (containing the nerve ganglia) of mussels. The activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), dopamine and serotonin-dependent adenylyl cyclase (ADC) were also determined in the mussels. Oxidative stress was determined by tracking changes in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions. The results revealed that the drugs and the effluent extract were biologically active in mussels. Morphine reduced serotonin and increased dopamine in mussel tissues while reducing AChE activity and increasing GABA levels. This suggests the induction of a relaxation state in mussels. Diazepam also reduced serotonin levels but produced no change in dopamine levels. However, dopamine-sensitive ADC activity was readily activated, indicating the potential effect on opiate signaling. Diazepam increased glutamate levels slightly, but AChE remained stable. The increase in both dopamine ADC activity and glutamate concentrations was also associated with greater oxidative stress on the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions in cells. A comparison of the global response pattern of these drugs with those of the effluent extract revealed only a relative proximity to morphine. In conclusion, the data warrant more studies on the analysis of opiates and benzodiazepines in municipal effluents to better address the potential environmental hazard of these neuroactive drug classes to aquatic organisms.", 
    "168": "Specific binding of (3)H-flunitrazepam with synaptosomal membranes after exposure to open field test and \"contact with predator\" test was measured in C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice. Stress-induced decrease in benzodiazepine binding after open field test was observed only in BALB/c mice and after contact with predator in both animal strains.", 
    "169": "Experiments on rats demonstrated antiaggressive activity of ultralow doses of antibodies to S-100 protein in tests of motivated and unmotivated aggression. The effect of ultralow doses of antibodies to S-100 protein in single and course treatment was not inferior to that of benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam.", 
    "170": "Region-selected intensity determination (RSID) is a method for obtaining the temporal changes in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal intensity from a target region, without the use of complicated procedures employed in the conventional imaging methods. An in vivo 700-MHz radio frequency EPR spectrometer equipped with a bridged loop-gap resonator was used with the RSID method to estimate intracerebral reducing ability in the rat following acute administration of olanzapine (OZP) or haloperidol (HPD). To this end, temporal changes in EPR signal intensity of target regions (the striatum and the prefrontal cortex) of rats which had received a blood-brain-barrier-permeable nitroxide radical (3-hydroxymethyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-oxyl) via an intravenous route were observed. The half-lives of EPR signal intensity in both regions of OZP- or HPD-treated rats were significantly longer than in control animals. This indicated that reducing abilities of the striatum and cerebral cortex decreased in the rats to which either OZP or HPD had been acutely administered.", 
    "171": "The second generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs) are effective in treating patients with schizophrenia and have been considered as the first line therapy. Recently, increasing attention has been drawn to the potential diabetogenic effect of these novel antipsychotics. The goal of this study was to evaluate the time-dependent effects of olanzapine treatment on pancreatic beta cell function in SGA-na\u00efve schizophrenic patients. Forty-two schizophrenic subjects received olanzapine therapy for 8 weeks and thirty-three of them completed the trial. Of whom 33 completers (21 male, mean+/-SD age: 37.6+/-8.0 years) were inpatients and unexposed to SGA. The metabolic parameters were quantitatively assessed at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8 by the intravenous glucose tolerance test. After 56-day olanzapine treatment, subjects had significant increases in body weight and as well as in the levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein. Insulin secretion significantly decreased at week 2, returned to baseline at week 4, and significantly increased at week 8. Of the total samples, 18.2% and 33.3% of them met the criteria for significant weight gain and metabolic syndrome after 8-week olanzapine treatment, respectively. This study indicates that olanzapine-treated schizophrenic patients displayed biphasic changes in insulin secretion to a hyperglycemic challenge. The results of this study support that olanzapine might directly influence pancreatic beta cell function.",

    "174": "Sixteen healthy adult male subjects were enrolled in a two-phase randomized crossover design. In each phase the volunteers received placebo or glycyrrhizin for 14 days. On the 15th day, midazolam was administered and blood samples were obtained to determine midazolam plasma concentrations. Bioequivalence was assessed by determining geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and 90% confidence intervals (90% CI).", 
    "175": "The geometric mean (geometric coefficient of variation) for the AUC(0-infinity) of midazolam in the placebo group was 196.4 ng x h/ml (30.3%) and after glycyrrhizin treatment, 151.3 ng x h/ml (34.7%). The GMRs and 90% CI for AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of midazolam in the presence/ absence of glycyrrhizin were 0.77 (0.70, 0.89) and 0.83 (0.74, 1.01), respectively. The 90% CI for AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax for the GMR of glycyrrhizin over placebo were both out of the no-effect boundaries of 0.80-1.25.",

    "177": "Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is a procedure which is not usually tolerated well by the patient. This makes the examination more difficult, often needing repetition with the subsequent lowering of diagnostic performance.", 
    "178": "The principal aim of our study is to analyse whether the use of a local anaesthetic with midazolam whilst performing an FB improves the quality of examination in terms of patient tolerance. Also of interest was to find out if this would improve the acceptance of a second or further FB, and the satisfaction of the bronchoscopist in performing these examinations.", 
    "179": "A randomised, double blind and controlled with placebo, prospective study has been carried out to assess the use of midazolam. This included 152 patients, randomised into two groups: Group A-79 (51.9%) patients who received midazolam before the FB, and Group B-73 (49.1%) patients who received placebo. The patients were given a questionnaire about different aspects of perception of the procedure after the respiratory endoscopy and another was given to the bronchoscopist.", 
    "180": "Both groups started off with a similar assessment of fear and nervousness. Group A gave a much higher score than Group B referring to variables related to symptoms and feeling. Patient cooperation assessed by the bronchoscopist was similar in both groups, although the length of the procedure and difficulty was higher in group B.", 
    "181": "Our results show that patients sedated with midazolam tolerate FB better, remember less of the procedure itself and have a better predisposition to repeat the procedure. The bronchoscopist has less difficulties during the procedure and shortens the time using the same techniques during the bronchoscopy. The lack of severe complications and these results suggest the use of sedation with midazolam as routine during FB.",

    "183": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study in 186 patients aged 18-65 years with IBS diagnosed according to Rome II criteria. Following a 2-week washout period, patients received octatropine plus diazepam 40 mg/2.5 mg twice daily or placebo for 6 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was response to a weekly question: \"did you have satisfactory relief of your abdominal pain and discomfort during the last week?\" Other endpoints included abdominal swelling, abdominal pain and discomfort, symptom severity, and the number of bowel movements. A prespecified subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with an abdominal pain and discomfort score > or = 3.", 
    "184": "The primary efficacy endpoint showed a tendency towards a statistically significant benefit for octatropine plus diazepam over placebo among patients with a baseline abdominal pain and discomfort score of > or = 3 (3 vs. 0 patients; p = 0.059). Octatropine plus diazepam demonstrated significant improvements from baseline in all parameters assessed, but not compared with placebo. Adverse events were reported in 15.1% of patients receiving octatropine plus diazepam.", 
    "185": "Patients with IBS and an abdominal pain and discomfort score of > or = 3, who may be considered in the active phase of the disease, may derive some benefits from octatropine plus diazepam. This study highlights that Rome II criteria should be considered with particular care in the design of a clinical trial, since it does not consider disease activity level on admission.", 
    "186": "Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which are coupled to second messenger pathways via G proteins, modulate glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. Because of their role in modulating neurotransmission, mGluRs are attractive therapeutic targets for anxiety disorders. Previously we showed that mGluR8(-/-) male mice showed higher measures of anxiety in the open field and elevated plus maze than age-matched wild-type mice. In this study, we assessed the potential effects of acute pharmacological modulation of mGluR8 on measures of avoidable and unavoidable anxiety. In addition to wild-type mice, we also tested apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe(-/-)) mice, as these mice show increased levels of anxiety-like behaviors and therefore might show an altered sensitivity to mGluR8 stimulation. mGluR8 stimulation with the specific agonist DCPG, or modulation with AZ12216052, a new, positive allosteric modulator of mGluR8 reduced measures of anxiety in both wild-type mice. The effects of mGluR8 positive allosteric modulators, which only affect neurotransmission in the presence of extracellular glutamate, seem particularly promising for patients with anxiety disorders showing benzodiazepine insensitivity.", 
    "187": "Cholinergic modulation of spontaneous GABAergic currents (mIPSC) was studied using whole-cell patch methods in mouse accessory olfactory bulb slices. Carbachol (above 100 microM) administration produced an increase in the mIPSC frequency in mitral cells, but did not affect the responses of mitral cells to GABA. The carbachol effect persisted in the presence of combined ionotropic and metabotropic glutamatergic receptor antagonists. The carbachol effect was reduced by the muscarinic receptor type-1 and -4 (M1 and M4) antagonist pirenzepine (10 microM), but not by the M2 and M4 antagonist himbacine (10 microM). The KCNQ/Kv7 potassium channel openers retigabine (80 microM) and diclofenac (300 microM) blocked the carbachol action, while the KCNQ potassium channel blocker XE-911 (20 microM) increased the mIPSC frequency. XE-911's action persisted in the presence of glutamate receptor blockers. In the presence of carbachol, mIPSCs were abolished by Ni (200 microM), while being insensitive to the calcium channel blocker nimodipine (30 microM), suggesting a role for R-type calcium channels in the GABA release. These results suggest that carbachol closed KCNQ channels by stimulating M1 receptors on granule cell dendrites, and the resulting depolarized and unstable membrane promoted calcium influx, thus increasing the GABA release. The possible role of acetylcholine in facilitating formation of a pheromone memory in mice is also discussed.", 
    "188": "Antiepileptic drug (AED) intoxications are common due in part to wide clinical application and availability. Because AEDs usually depress central nervous system function, overdosing may be potentially life-threatening or lead to a range of adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonbenzodiazepine AED (NBAED) intoxication.", 
    "189": "In this cross-sectional study, all consecutive adult and adolescent (>12 years old) poisoned patients who presented to the Loghman-Hakim Poison Hospital (LHPH) during a 6-month period were evaluated. Patients with NBAED intoxication were identified and compared to a control group of those other pharmaceutical intoxications. The risk factors for AED intoxication were identified using univariate analyses and multivariate modeling.", 
    "190": "Among 9,809 cases of pharmaceutical agent overdose, there were 474 cases (4.8%) with NBAED intoxication. Mean age of the subjects was 24.5 +/- 8.9 years. The most frequent NBAED was carbamazepine (n = 117), followed by phenobarbital (n = 77) and sodium valproate (n = 51). The most frequent motivation was intentional intoxication (95.3%). Multivariate analysis revealed that presence of medical disorders, a history of psychological events, and loneliness were associated with AED intoxication, whereas educational level had a protective effect. There was no association between previous history of parasuicide, sex, age, occupation status, and AED intoxication.", 
    "191": "In conclusion, this study showed that the majority of AED intoxications are due to deliberate self poisoning. The presence of psychological events, medical disorders, and loneliness are risk factors for AED intoxication, whereas higher education level has a protective effect.", 
    "192": "The astrocytic enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) is a key regulator of glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism in the glutamate/glutamine cycle (GGC). Inhibition of GS results in changes of neurotransmitter release and recycling. However, little is known about the influence of GGC on neurotransmitter receptor expression. In the pentylenetetrazole model of epilepsy, GS becomes nitrated and partially inhibited, and we demonstrated alterations of neurotransmitter receptor expression in the same model. Therefore, we hypothesized similar changes of neurotransmitter receptor expression when GS is inhibited in vivo.",

In addition, we performed saturation analysis of BZ binding sites on cerebral membrane homogenates and investigated the expression of GABA(A) \u03b1\u2081 and \u03b3\u2082 subunits (which primarily mediate BZ binding) by western blot analysis.", 
    "194": "We demonstrated a significant reduction of BZ binding in the somatosensory, piriform, and entorhinal cortices and in the amygdala, 24 and 72 h after MSO treatment. Saturation analysis revealed decreased BZ binding (B(max)) on cerebral membrane homogenates 72 h after MSO treatment, without changes in binding site affinity (K(D)). Furthermore, we found differential changes of \u03b1\u2081 , \u03b3\u2082 , and phosphorylated \u03b3\u2082 subunits following MSO treatment.",

Hemodynamic/fluid support is essential. Nutritional support is crucial and hypoproteinemic diets should be avoided. Blocking benzodiazepine-like compounds by the use of flumazenil could be useful in patients with severe, benzodiazepine-induced HE. Long-term rifaximin is well tolerated, does not promote resistance and could decrease overt HE bouts in patients with previous episodes of overt HE. Lactulose is better than no treatment in improving quality of life in patients with minimal HE; it also acts as secondary prophylaxis following overt HE.",

Despite this, drug prescribing in the elderly in Sweden is high and increasing. In 2003 the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare launched a set of indicators to evaluate the quality of drug therapy in the elderly. Use of this tool in combination with the Swedish computerized national register covering all persons receiving multi-dose drug dispensing (drugs dispensed in one dose unit bag for each dose occasion) would enable detection of inappropriate drug prescribing and could help reduce the risk of drug-related problems among the elderly.",

The proportion of residents with prescriptions for psychotropic drugs was 80% in NHs and 85% in NHDs. The prevalence of each drug-specific quality indicator was as follows: long-acting benzodiazepines 16.4% (NHs) versus 11.7% (NHDs), anticholinergic drugs 20.7% versus 18.5%, drug duplication 14.6% versus 13.6%, three or more psychotropic drugs 25.6% versus 35.3%, class C interactions (drug combinations that may require dose adjustment) 41.9% versus 38.7% and class D interactions (drug combinations that should be avoided) 8.1% versus 5.6%. Younger elderly residents (age 65-79 years) had a lower quality of drug prescribing. An increasing number of prescribers per resident was associated with a lower quality of drug therapy.",

    "205": "A large gap exists between the number of people needing treatment and the number of people receiving treatment for depression in the Middle East. Barriers to mental health care in the region have included the lack of education for primary health care providers about mental illnesses, the scarcity of trained mental health care specialists, the lack of resources in developing countries, and the stigmatization of mental illness in Middle Eastern cultures. Guidelines for the treatment of depression have not been developed in most countries of the region. Guidelines have been published for both general practitioners and for psychiatrists in Turkey, and they are similar to guidelines published in the West. These guidelines are assessed using the AGREE instrument. Although guidelines recommend antidepressants as a first-line treatment for depression, many physicians in Middle Eastern countries prescribe benzodiazepines. One reason for this treatment gap may be that patients with depression often seek treatment from primary care providers and report somatic symptoms. Primary care providers may not be as knowledgeable about the diagnosis of depression or its treatment as psychiatrists and may not have access to certain classes of medications. More education for both physicians and patients in the Middle East is needed to decrease the stigma associated with depression.", 
    "206": "Depression is a common illness in the Chinese population, but very few people with depression seek treatment or are properly diagnosed and treated when they do visit a medical professional. One potential result of this situation is that suicidality is higher than it might be if more people with depression received appropriate treatment. When patients do receive pharmacotherapy for depression, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants are overprescribed. The Chinese psychiatric establishment has published a sufficient guideline outlining treatment strategies for depressive disorders, but education for psychiatrists and general practitioners is needed.", 
    "207": "The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment, which include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only.", 
    "208": "Antidepressants have proven efficacy in the treatment of acute depressive episodes and the prevention of relapse over the long-term. However, whether due to ignorance about the chronicity of depression, intolerable adverse effects, or an inappropriate fear of dependence, antidepressants are often discontinued after remission or recovery from an acute episode, which frequently leads to relapse or recurrence. This, in turn, increases the risk of subsequent poor treatment response and lifelong depressive chronicity. Clinicians should focus on preventing depressive relapse with long-term antidepressant pharmacotherapy, thereby improving patients' overall outcomes, particularly with patients at high risk for relapse. When patients with depression have comorbid anxiety, benzodiazepines may be useful but should be used only as short-term augmentation during the beginning phase of antidepressant treatment; long-term treatment of comorbid anxiety is better managed by antidepressants that also treat anxiety disorders.", 
    "209": "Many new candidate pharmaceuticals designed to improve recovery after stroke have been proposed recently, but there are still too few molecular imaging methods capable to assess their efficacy.

Minocycline or saline was intravenously administrated 1 h after reperfusion and daily during the following 6 days. PET studies were performed using [(18)F]DPA-714 at 7 days after cerebral ischemia.", 
    "212": "In vivo PET imaging showed a significant decrease in [(18)F]DPA-714 uptake at 7 days after cerebral ischemia in rats treated with minocycline with respect to saline-treated animals. Minocycline treatment had no effect on the size of the infarcted area.", 
    "213": "Minocycline administered daily during 7 days after ischemia decreases [(18)F]DPA-714 binding, suggesting that the drug exerts an anti-inflammatory activity. [(18)F]DPA-714 PET is a useful biomarker to study novel anti-inflammatory strategies in experimental cerebral ischemia."
