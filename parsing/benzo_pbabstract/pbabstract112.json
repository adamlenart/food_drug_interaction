    "0": "Sharp waves and the concurrent high-frequency \"ripple\" oscillation (100-200 Hz) is a prominent intrinsic hippocampal network activity that occurs during slow-wave sleep and resting wakefulness with an important role in memory processes. Present data suggest that the generation of sharp wave-ripple (SWRs) requires a complex interaction between the various components of the hippocampal network with the important involvement of GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R)-mediated transmission. The positive modulators of GABA(A)Rs zolpidem and diazepam differ in their selectivity for the various subtypes of GABA(A)Rs. Only zolpidem preferentially binds to \u03b11-containing receptors whereas diazepam, but not zolpidem, also activates \u03b15-GABA(A)Rs. In this study using an in vitro model of SWRs we examined the hypothesis that the two drugs distinctly affect the various characteristics of SWRs. Remarkably, the two drugs displayed opposite effects on the ripple oscillation. Zolpidem enhanced whereas diazepam suppressed ripples. Furthermore diazepam, but not zolpidem, produced a temporal dissociation between ripples and sharp waves. Both drugs suppressed the generation of SWRs in the form of sequences of multiple events (i.e. clusters). It was also observed that at low concentrations both drugs increased the rate of initiation of episodes of SWR. At high concentration zolpidem but not diazepam continued to increase the rate of episodes of SWRs. We propose that an accurate yet dynamic balance between excitation and inhibition in specific sites of the hippocampal network distinctly regulates the generation of basic features of SWRs such as ripples and sequential activation of the neuronal assemblies which have particular functional roles.", 
    "1": "Cloxazolam has been used mainly as an anxiolytic agent. The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of cloxazolam as an add-on antiepileptic drug in patients with intractable epilepsy. A total of 32 patients with intractable epilepsy were treated with cloxazolam: 13 with generalized epilepsy, 15 with focal epilepsy, and 4 with undetermined type of epilepsy. The initial effects were evaluated at 1 month after reaching a maintenance dose (0.3-0.5 mg/kg). The long-term effects were investigated at 2 years after reaching a maintenance dose. With cloxazolam, seizure frequency was reduced by \u2265 50% in 19/32 patients (59%) during initial therapy and in 6/23 patients (26%) during long-term therapy. Two became seizure free throughout the cloxazolam therapy. During initial therapy, 8/32 patients (25%) developed 11 episodes of adverse events during the initial therapy, including 5 with drowsiness, 3 with hyperactivity, 2 with irritability, and 1 with loss of appetite. During long-term therapy, 2/23 (9%) developed drowsiness. The mean dose of cloxazolam in patients with an effective response was 0.30 \u00b1 0.18 mg/kg for initial therapy and 0.26 \u00b1 0.20 mg/kg for long-term therapy. Seven of the 19 effective responders developed tolerance (37%). Cloxazolam is an effective and safe antiepileptic drug for intractable epilepsy.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) and barbiturates exert their CNS actions by binding to GABA-A receptors (GABARs). The structural mechanisms by which these drugs allosterically modulate GABAR function, to either enhance or inhibit GABA-gated current, are poorly understood. Here, we used the substituted cysteine accessibility method to examine and compare structural movements in the GABA-binding site interface triggered by a BZD positive (flurazepam), zero (flumazenil) and negative (3-carbomethoxy-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-\u03b2-carboline, DMCM) modulator as well as the barbiturate pentobarbital. Ten residues located throughout the GABA-binding site interface were individually mutated to cysteine. Wild-type and mutant \u03b1(1)\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2) GABARs were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and functionally characterized using two-electrode voltage clamp. We measured and compared the rates of modification of the introduced cysteines by sulfhydryl-reactive methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents in the absence and presence of BZD-site ligands and pentobarbital. Flurazepam and DMCM each accelerated the rate of reaction at \u03b1(1)R131C and slowed the rate of reaction at \u03b1(1)E122C, whereas flumazenil had no effect indicating that simple occupation of the BZD binding site is not sufficient to cause movements near these positions. Therefore, BZD-induced movements at these residues are likely associated with the ability of the BZD to modulate GABAR function (BZD efficacy). Low, modulating concentrations of pentobarbital accelerated the rate of reaction at \u03b1(1)S68C and \u03b2(2)P206C, slowed the rate of reaction at \u03b1(1)E122C and had no effect at \u03b1(1)R131C. These findings indicate that pentobarbital and BZDs induce different movements in the receptor, providing evidence that the structural mechanisms underlying their allosteric modulation of GABAR function are distinct.", 
    "3": "Neurodegeneration is thought to be a component of schizophrenia pathology, and some antipsychotics appear to slow degenerative changes in patients. Aripiprazole, the first partial dopamine D(2) receptor agonist approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, is suggested to be neuroprotective based on non-clinical studies using transformed cell lines and in vivo stress and lesion paradigms. However, aripiprazole-induced neuroprotection has not been studied in a neuronal glutamate toxicity assay, which may model aspects of neurodegeneration occurring in schizophrenia. This study examined whether therapeutically relevant concentrations of aripiprazole protect rat embryonic cortical neurons from glutamate toxicity in biochemical and high-content imaging assays. Aripiprazole inhibited glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by 40% in a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, in contrast to risperidone and olanzapine, which had little neuroprotective activity. This neuroprotective effect of aripiprazole was not mediated by the activation of serotonin 5-HT(1A) or dopamine D(2) receptors, Akt or glycogen-synthase kinase-3\u03b2 signaling (GSK-3\u03b2), or through the inhibition of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Further experiments are required to determine the biochemical nature of aripiprazole-induced neuroprotection and whether any such activity might have clinical relevance.",

Such coping motives may also vary as a function of gender, with women more likely to use substances for coping (self-medicating) purposes. Given these findings, we hypothesized that AS would be associated with illicit sedative use in an opioid-dependent sample and that gender would moderate this relationship, with a greater association among women.",

Following the first-generation neuroleptics, associated with many extrapyramidal side effects (severe dystonias, parkinsonian syndrome, akatisia and late dyskinesia) altering patients' compliance to the treatment, one can now find a new generation of molecules considered as atypical antipsychotics because they rarely cause neurological complications. This propriety provides a better compliance, along with a clear decrease of late dyskinesia risk but the effectiveness compared to ordinary molecules is still questioned. However, some of them can cause an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Some molecules such as benzodiazepines and some antidepressants can also be prescribed to cure schizophrenic patients.",

(Passifloraceae) is important in herbal medicine for treating anxiety or nervousness, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), symptoms of opiate withdrawal, insomnia, neuralgia, convulsion, spasmodic asthma, ADHD, palpitations, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, hypertension, sexual dysfunction and menopause. However, the mechanism of action is still under discussion. Despite gaps in our understanding of neurophysiological processes, it is increasingly being recognized that dysfunction of the GABA system is implicated in many neuropsychiatric conditions, including anxiety and depressive disorders. Therefore, the in vitro effects of a dry extract of Passiflora incarnata (sole active ingredient in Pascoflair\u00ae 425 mg) on the GABA system were investigated. The extract inhibited [(3) H]-GABA uptake into rat cortical synaptosomes but had no effect on GABA release and GABA transaminase activity. Passiflora incarnata inhibited concentration dependently the binding of [(3) H]- SR95531 to GABA(A) -receptors and of [(3) H]-CGP 54626 to GABA(B) -receptors. Using the [(35) S]-GTP\u03b3S binding assay Passiflora could be classified as an antagonist of the GABA(B) receptor. In contrast, the ethanol- and the benzodiazepine-site of the GABA(A) -receptor were not affected by this extract. In conclusion, the first evidence was shown that numerous pharmacological effects of Passiflora incarnata are mediated via modulation of the GABA system including affinity to GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, and effects on GABA uptake.",

Although maintenance data are limited, quetiapine monotherapy, risperidone adjunctive therapy, and amisulpride adjunctive therapy significantly delayed the time to relapse as compared with placebo. In general, extrapyramidal symptoms appeared to be low with SGAs, but a higher incidence of akathisia was observed with aripiprazole. An elevated risk of weight gain was observed with olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, risperidone, aripiprazole, and quetiapine compared with placebo. At present, there are insufficient data to confidently distinguish between different SGAs in the treatment of MDD. A recent meta-analysis found that adjunctive SGAs were significantly more effective than placebo, but differences in efficacy were not identified among the studied agents, nor were outcomes affected by trial duration or the method of establishing treatment resistance.",

Replacement of the enamine functionality of the hit series with either an imidazole or a pyrazole ring led to compounds that inhibited both capsid assembly and reverse transcriptase.

    "18": "There is considerable interest in the development of an inhibitor of aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C3 (type 5 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and prostaglandin F synthase) as a potential therapeutic for both hormone-dependent and hormone-independent cancers. AKR1C3 catalyzes the reduction of 4-androstene-3,17-dione to testosterone and estrone to 17\u03b2-estradiol in target tissues, which will promote the proliferation of hormone dependent prostate and breast cancers, respectively. AKR1C3 also catalyzes the reduction of prostaglandin (PG) H(2) to PGF(2\u03b1) and PGD(2) to 9\u03b1,11\u03b2-PGF(2), which will limit the formation of anti-proliferative prostaglandins, including 15-deoxy-\u0394(12,14)-PGJ(2), and contribute to proliferative signaling. AKR1C3 is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers, including breast and prostate cancer. An inhibitor of AKR1C3 should not inhibit the closely related isoforms AKR1C1 and AKR1C2, as they are involved in other key steroid hormone biotransformations in target tissues. Several structural leads have been explored as inhibitors of AKR1C3, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid hormone analogues, flavonoids, cyclopentanes, and benzodiazepines. Inspection of the available crystal structures of AKR1C3 with multiple ligands bound, along with the crystal structures of the other AKR1C isoforms, provides a structural basis for the rational design of isoform specific inhibitors of AKR1C3. We find that there are subpockets involved in ligand binding that are considerably different in AKR1C3 relative to the closely related AKR1C1 or AKR1C2 isoforms. These pockets can be used to further improve the binding affinity and selectivity of the currently available AKR1C3 inhibitors. Article from the special issue on Targeted Inhibitors.", 
    "19": "Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is implicated in a variety of stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety, and blocking CRF receptors is a putative strategy for treating such disorders. Using a well-studied animal model of panic, we tested the efficacy of JNJ19567470/CRA5626, a selective, non-peptidergic CRF type 1 receptor (CRF1) antagonist (3, 10 and 40 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection), in preventing the sodium lactate (NaLac)-induced panic-like behavioural and cardiovascular responses. Adult male rats with chronic reduction of GABA levels (by inhibition of GABA synthesis with l-allyglycine, a glutamic acid decarboxylase inhibitor) in the dorsomedial/perifornical hypothalamus are highly anxious and exhibit physiological and behavioural responses to intravenous NaLac infusions similar to patients with panic disorder. These 'panic-prone' rats pre-treated with vehicle injections displayed NaLac-induced increases in autonomic responses (i.e. tachycardia and hypertensive responses), anxiety-like behaviour in the social interaction test, and flight-like increases in locomotor activity. However, systemically injecting such panic-prone rats with the highest dose of CRF1 receptor antagonist prior to NaLac infusions blocked all NaLac-induced behaviour and cardiovascular responses. These data suggest that selective CRF1 receptor antagonists could be a novel target for developing anti-panic drugs that are as effective as benzodiazepines in acute treatment of a panic attack without the deleterious side-effects (e.g. sedation and cognitive impairment) associated with benzodiazepines.", 
    "20": "Several sets of explicit criteria for potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) have been developed by expert consensus. The purpose of this review is to summarize and compare existing criteria to enable more informed choices about their use. After a systematic literature search was conducted, seven examples of criteria published between 1991 and 2009 were included in the review and their individual characteristics are presented. Common medications listed in the majority of these criteria are also summarized. PIMs listed regardless of co-morbidities in all seven criteria sets were long-acting benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. PIMs regardless of co-morbidities were most similar among the Beers, Rancourt and Winit-Watjana criteria. Several drug-disease interactions such as benzodiazepines and falls were cited in most criteria. With respect to drug-drug interactions, most criteria agreed that concomitant use of warfarin and NSAIDs should be avoided. The prevalence of PIMs varied with patient population, availability of medications in local markets, the specialties of the prescribing physicians and the assessment instruments used. The associations between PIMs use and health outcomes were largely inconclusive because of limited data. Further research is necessary to validate these published criteria in terms of reducing the incidence of adverse drug reactions and improving health outcomes among older adults. Incorporation of these criteria into computer-assisted order entry systems would increase their utilization in daily practice.",

The study was conducted according to formalized protocol using standard scales and methods. Results suggest that higher self-rated tolerability and patient acceptability were associated with afobazole treatment in comparison to benzodiazepines.

    "22": "Previous studies and Expt. 1 of the current study demonstrate that diets made with soy protein isolate (SPI) enhance the glucocorticoid-inducibility of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A-dependent monooxygenase activities (P < 0.05) compared with diets made with casein (CAS). To determine the underlying molecular mechanism, in a second experiment, we analyzed the time course of dexamethasone (DEX)-induction of hepatic CYP3A mRNA expression on postnatal d (PND) 25 and PND60 in male and female rats fed SPI- or CAS-based diets. After 50 mg(/)kg DEX, CYP3A1 mRNA expression increased >200-fold in SPI-fed males and females at PND25 compared with a 100-fold increase in CAS-fed rats (P < 0.05). The DEX-induced increase in CYP3A1 mRNA in SPI-fed rats on PND60 was also greater than that in CAS-fed rats. The induction by DEX of CYP3A2 mRNA was 1- to 3-fold greater in rats fed SPI compared with those fed CAS on PND25 (P < 0.05). Quantitation of newly synthesized CYP3A1 RNA transcripts by nuclear run-on analysis demonstrated a greater rate of basal transcription in SPI-fed compared with CAS-fed rats on PND60 accompanied by greater binding of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) to a response element on the CYP3A1 promoter in SPI-fed compared with CAS-fed rats (P < 0.05). These data suggest that increased hepatic CYP3A expression and inducibility following SPI feeding involves recruitment of PXR to its response element and suggests that soy consumption has potential effects on metabolism and transport of a wide variety of drugs and on bile acid homeostasis via proteins regulated by this transcription factor.", 
    "23": "Identifying neurobiological predictors of response to antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia is a critical goal of translational psychiatry. Few studies, however, have investigated the relationship between indices of brain structure and treatment response in the context of a controlled clinical trial. In this study, we sought to identify magnetic resonance (MR) imaging measures of the brain that predict treatment response in patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia. Structural MR imaging scans were acquired in 39 patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia with minimal or no prior exposure to antipsychotics participating in a double-blind 16-week clinical trial comparing the efficacy of risperidone vs olanzapine. Twenty-five patients were classified as responders by meeting operationally defined treatment response criteria on 2 consecutive study visits. Fourteen patients never responded to antipsychotic medication at any point during the clinical trial. MR imaging scans were also acquired in 45 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Cortical pattern matching methods were used to compare cortical thickness and asymmetry measures among groups. Statistical mapping results, confirmed by permutation testing, indicated that responders had greater cortical thickness in occipital regions and greater frontal cortical asymmetry compared with nonresponders. Moreover, among responders, greater thickness in temporal regions was associated with less time to respond. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that plasticity and cortical thickness may be more preserved in responders and that MR imaging may assist in the prediction of antipsychotic drug response in patients experiencing a first-episode of schizophrenia.",

The number of complications of anesthesia was higher among patients with multiple morbidities, but these complications could be easily overcome in all patient groups. Therefore, this method is highly recommended for patients with multiple morbidities. Intubation narcosis can be also a viable option of conscious sedation for patients without co-morbidities.",

In two pivotal, double-blind clinical trials of 8 or 24 weeks' duration, the efficacy of recommended dosages of OLAI injected every 2 or 4 weeks (without oral supplementation) was greater than that of placebo in improving symptoms in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia, and generally similar to that of continuing oral olanzapine in preventing psychotic exacerbations in patients with schizophrenia whose symptoms had previously been stabilized on oral olanzapine. The effectiveness of OLAI in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia was also demonstrated in an (ongoing) open-label extension study in which the all-cause discontinuation rate was 34.3% after 18 months. OLAI is generally well tolerated. It has an adverse event profile similar to that of oral olanzapine, with the exception of adverse events related to the intramuscular route of administration; these include a manageable post-injection syndrome, which occurred in <0.1% of injections in clinical trials. The possibility of a post-injection syndrome event requires a risk management plan (RMP) to be adopted that includes observation by appropriately qualified personnel in a healthcare facility for at least 3 hours post-injection. With its potential to improve adherence to medication, and thereby treatment outcomes, OLAI is a useful addition to the pharmacological options available for the maintenance therapy of schizophrenia. Given its benefit/risk profile, OLAI appears most suited for patients who, despite responding well to oral olanzapine, have difficulties remaining adherent to this form of medication, provided they can comply with the conditions of the RMP.", 
    "35": "Recent observations suggest the existence of clonazepam abuse. To determine its importance in France, a quantitative and systematic synthesis of all clonazepam data of several epidemiological tools of the Centers for Evaluation and Information on Pharmacodependence (CEIP) network has been performed in comparison with data on others benzodiazepines (BZD). Data on clonazepam and other BZD have been analysed from different epidemiological tools: OSIAP survey that identifies drugs obtained by means of falsified prescriptions, Observation of Illegal Drugs and Misuse of Psychotropic Medications (OPPIDUM) survey that describes modalities of use and data from regional French health reimbursement system. In OSIAP survey, the proportion of clonazepam falsified prescriptions among all BZD falsified prescriptions increased. During the 2006 OPPIDUM survey, the analysis of the BZD modalities of use highlights clonazepam abuse liability (for example 23% of illegal acquisition), in second rank after flunitrazepam. Studies based on data from the French health reimbursed system show that 1.5% of subjects with clonazepam dispensing had a deviant behaviour. Among BZD, clonazepam has the second most important doctor-shopping indicator (3%) after flunitrazepam. All these data provide some arguments in favour of clonazepam abuse liability in real life and the necessity to reinforce its monitoring.",

PDE2 has been recognized as an attractive drug target, and selective inhibitors of PDE2 are expected to be promising candidates for the memory enhancer, antidepressant, and anxiolytic agent. In the present study, we examined the detailed binding structures and free energies for PDE2 interacting with a promising series of inhibitors, i.e., benzo[1,4]diazepin-2-one derivatives, by carrying out molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations, and binding energy decompositions. The computational results provide valuable insights into the detailed enzyme-inhibitor binding modes including important intermolecular interactions, e.g., the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with the common benzo[1,4]diazepin-2-one scaffold of the inhibitors, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the substituents on the benzo[1,4]diazepin-2-one scaffold. Future rational design of new, more potent inhibitors of PDE2 should carefully account for all of these favorable intermolecular interactions. By use of the MD-simulated binding structures, the calculated binding free energies are in good agreement with the experimental activity data for all of the examined benzo[1,4]diazepin-2-one derivatives. The enzyme-inhibitor binding modes determined and the agreement between the calculated and experimental results are expected to be valuable for future rational design of more potent inhibitors of PDE2.",

The fractions were prepared as published recently, yielding a butanol, petroleum ether and chloroform fraction. From the tested fractions, the butanol fraction showed significant increases in the number of open arm entries in the EPM in concentrations of 2.1 mg/kg and 4.2 mg/kg corresponding to 150 and 300 mg/kg of the original extract. The highest activity was found for the chloroform fraction in doses of 0.17 mg/kg (10.0 \u00b1 1.9, p < 0.001) and 0.34 mg/kg (6.6 \u00b1 0.86; p < 0.05) which corresponds to a total extract dose of 150 and 300 mg/kg, respectively. Interestingly, the petroleum ether fraction did not show any effects in the elevated plus maze. A sedative or stimulatory effect of each of the fractions could be excluded, since none of the compounds had an influence on the total distance that the animals covered during the observation period.

    "58": "The story began on 11th May 1857 when Charles Locock commented in the Lancet on his use of potassium bromide in 15 cases of \"hysterical\" epilepsy in young women. The next development was the serendipitous discovery of the anticonvulsant properties of phenobarbital by Alfred Hauptmann in 1912. This predated by more than 20 years the screening of potential therapeutic agents against \"electrical seizures\" in cats by Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam. The result was the launching of phenytoin in 1938. Next came primidone, ethosuximide, carbamazepine and valproic acid, all of which can be regarded as first generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Shortly after their synthesis, the benzodiazepines were rapidly recognised as having anticonvulsant activity. The modern era focused on the systematic screening of many thousands of compounds against rodent seizure models under the Anticonvulsant Drug Development Program in the US. This resulted in the global licensing, in chronological order, of vigabatrin, zonisamide, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, felbamate, gabapentin, topiramate, tiagabine, levetiracetam, pregabalin and lacosamide. Rufinamide is available in the US and Europe for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and stiripentol has been made available for Dravet syndrome under the European orphan drug scheme. Eslicarbazepine can be prescribed in Europe for partial seizures, but not in the US. Has all this activity improved the lives of people with epilepsy?

    "64": "At present neurobiological interests are directing more attention towards the major role of the amygdalar GABA(A) receptor on orexin-dependent behaviors. This telencephalic region has been widely studied especially in view of its control on various psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. Recently, cross-talking relationships between these two specific neuroreceptor systems of the central-cortical amygdalar complex has been considered an important element for anxiety type of behaviors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of central amygdalar infusions with orexin-A, orexin-B\u00b1GABA(A) receptor \u03b1\u2082 subunit agonist (flunitrazepam) on elevated plus-maze and light-dark explorative behaviors of the facultative hibernating Syrian hamster. In a first case, it seemed that doses of orexin administered directly into the central nucleus were responsible for greater anxiogenic type of effects as shown by more time being spent both in the dark compartment and the closed arm of the elevated plus-maze, whereas, these effects were suppressed in the presence of flunitrazepam. At the cellular level, the effects of orexin accounted for evident argyrophilic reactions (neurodegeneration phenomena) including altered cell membrane and loss of cytoplasmic architecture in most amygdalar and hippocampal neuronal fields, while in the presence of flunitrazepam these reactions resulted to either be unappreciable or absent. Overall the actions of \u03b1\u2082-dependent inhibitory signals tend to corroborate, for the first time, a neuroprotective role against the over-excitatory orexinergic neurodegeneration reactions and thus its abnormal anxiety-like indications may prove to be therapeutically useful for orexin-dependent sleeping disorders.", 
    "65": "MRI-based measurements of surface cortical thickness (SCT) have become a sensitive tool to quantify changes in cortical morphology. When comparing SCT to histological cortical thickness maps, a good correspondence can be found for many but not all human brain areas. Discrepancies especially arise in the sensory motor cortex, where histological cortical thickness is high, but SCT is very low. The aim of this study was to determine whether the relationship between cortical thickness and neuronal density is the same for different cytoarchitectonic areas throughout homo- and heterotypical isocortex. We assessed this relationship using high-resolution [(18)F]-labelled flumazenil (FMZ) PET and SCT-mapping. FMZ binds to the benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor complex which is localized on axo-dendritic synapses, with a cortical distribution closely following the local density of neurons. SCT and voxelwise FMZ binding potential (BP(ND)) were assessed in ten healthy subjects. After partial volume correction, two subsets with a differential relationship between SCT and BP(ND) were identified: a fronto-parietal homotypical subset where neuronal density is relatively constant and mainly independent of SCT, and a subset comprising heterotypical and mainly temporal and occipital homotypical regions where neuronal density is negatively correlated with SCT. This is the first in-vivo study demonstrating a differential relationship between SCT, neuronal density and cytoarchitectonics in humans. These findings are of direct relevance for the correct interpretation of SCT-based morphometry studies, in that there is no simple relationship between apparent cortical thickness and neuronal density, here attributed to FMZ binding, holding for all cortical regions.",

Twelve randomised control trials compared clozapine with olanzapine, five with quetiapine, nine with risperidone, one with ziprasidone and two with zotepine. Attrition from these studies was high (overall 30.1%), leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Clozapine had a higher attrition rate due to adverse effects than olanzapine (9 RCTs, n=1674, RR 1.60 CI 1.07 to 2.40, NNT 25 CI 15 to 73) and risperidone (6 RCTs, n=627, RR 1.88 CI 1.11 to 3.21, NNT 16 CI 9 to 59).

There was no significant difference between clozapine and olanzapine or risperidone in terms of positive or negative symptoms of schizophrenia. According to two studies from China quetiapine was more efficacious for negative symptoms than clozapine (2 RCTs, n=142, MD 2.23 CI 0.99 to 3.48).Clozapine produced somewhat fewer extrapyramidal side-effects than risperidone (use of antiparkinson medication: 6 RCTs, n=304, RR 0.39 CI 0.22 to 0.68, NNT 7 CI 5 to 18) and zotepine (n=59, RR 0.05 CI 0.00 to 0.86, NNT 3 CI 2 to 5). More participants in the clozapine group showed decreased white blood cells than those taking olanzapine, more hypersalivation and sedation than those on olanzapine, risperidone and quetiapine and more seizures than people on olanzapine and risperidone. Also clozapine produced an important weight gain not seen with risperidone.Other differences in adverse effects were less documented and should be replicated, for example, clozapine did not alter prolactin levels whereas olanzapine, risperidone and zotepine did; compared with quetiapine, clozapine produced a higher incidence of electrocardiogram (ECG) alterations; and compared with quetiapine and risperidone clozapine produced a higher increase of triglyceride levels. Other findings that should be replicated were: clozapine improved social functioning less than risperidone and fewer participants in the clozapine group had to be hospitalised to avoid suicide attempts compared to olanzapine.Other important outcomes such as service use, cognitive functioning, satisfaction with care or quality of life were rarely reported.", 
    "91": "Clozapine may be a little more efficacious than zotepine and risperidone but further trials are required to confirm this finding. Clozapine differs more clearly in adverse effects from other second generation antipsychotics and the side-effect profile could be key in the selection of treatment depending on the clinical situation and a patient's preferences. Data on other important outcomes such as cognitive functioning, quality of life, death or service use are currently largely missing, making further large and well-designed trials necessary. It is also important to take into account that the large number of people leaving the studies early limits the validity and interpretation of our findings.", 
    "92": "Interaction of pathogens with cells of the immune system results in activation of inflammatory gene expression. This response, although vital for immune defence, is frequently deleterious to the host due to the exaggerated production of inflammatory proteins. The scope of inflammatory responses reflects the activation state of signalling proteins upstream of inflammatory genes as well as signal-induced assembly of nuclear chromatin complexes that support mRNA expression. Recognition of post-translationally modified histones by nuclear proteins that initiate mRNA transcription and support mRNA elongation is a critical step in the regulation of gene expression. Here we present a novel pharmacological approach that targets inflammatory gene expression by interfering with the recognition of acetylated histones by the bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) family of proteins. We describe a synthetic compound (I-BET) that by 'mimicking' acetylated histones disrupts chromatin complexes responsible for the expression of key inflammatory genes in activated macrophages, and confers protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock and bacteria-induced sepsis. Our findings suggest that synthetic compounds specifically targeting proteins that recognize post-translationally modified histones can serve as a new generation of immunomodulatory drugs.",

Pharmacological induction of a transient GABA-deficit state has been shown to enhance vulnerability of healthy subjects to the psychotomimetic effects of various drugs. Exacerbating or creating a GABA deficit was hypothesized to induce or unmask psychosis in schizophrenia patients, but not in healthy controls. To test this hypothesis, a transient GABA deficit was pharmacologically induced in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls using iomazenil, an antagonist and partial inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, clinically stable chronic schizophrenia patients (n=13) received iomazenil (3.7\u2009\u03bcg administered intravenously over 10\u2009min). Psychosis was measured using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and perceptual alterations were measured using the Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale before and after iomazenil administration. These data were compared with the effects of iomazenil in healthy subjects (n=20). Iomazenil produced increases in psychotic symptoms and perceptual alterations in schizophrenia patients, but not in healthy controls. The greater vulnerability of schizophrenia patients to the effects of iomazenil relative to controls provides further support for the GABA-deficit hypothesis of schizophrenia.",

Double vascular occlusion pressure was recorded to locate the muscarinic receptors within the pulmonary vasculature. Based on the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC\u2085\u2080), the rank of order of antagonist potency was 4-DAMP > pirenzepine > methoctramine. The vascular effects of all three inhibitors were localized to the precapillary segment.

The particle size and zeta potential of microemulsions were evaluated upon dilution with aqueous medium. In vitro release was detected by a dialysis method in reverse. The effects of SMEDDS at different dilutions and surfactants at different concentrations on the metabolism of MDZ were investigated in murine hepatocytes. The cytotoxicity of SMEDDS at different dilutions was measured by LDH release and MTT technique. The effects of SMEDDS on the CYP3A enzymes activity were determined by Western blotting. Our results showed that dilution had less effect on the particle size and zeta potential in the range from 1:25 to 1:500. The MDZ was completely released in 10 h. A significant decrease in the formation of 1'-OH-MDZ in rat hepatocytes was observed after treatment with both SMEDDS at dilutions ranging from 1:50 to 1:250 and Cremophor RH 40 or Tween 80 at concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 1% (w/v), with no cytotoxicity observed. A significant decrease in CYP3A protein expression was observed in cells by Western blotting in the presence of either Cremophor RH40 or Tween 80-based SMEDDS at the dilutions ranging from 1:50 to 1:250. This study suggested that the excipient inhibitor-based formulation is a potential protective platform for decreasing metabolism of sensitive drugs that are CYP3A substrates.", 
    "102": "We studied the properties of the permeability transition pore (PTP) in rat liver mitochondria and in mitoplasts retaining inner membrane ultrastructure and energy-linked functions. Like mitochondria, mitoplasts readily underwent a permeability transition following Ca(2+) uptake in a process that maintained sensitivity to cyclosporin A. On the other hand, major differences between mitochondria and mitoplasts emerged in PTP regulation by ligands of the outer membrane translocator protein of 18 kDa, TSPO, formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. Indeed, (i) in mitoplasts, the PTP could not be activated by photo-oxidation after treatment with dicarboxylic porphyrins endowed with protoporphyrin IX configuration, which bind TSPO in intact mitochondria; and (ii) mitoplasts became resistant to the PTP-inducing effects of N,N-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide and of other selective ligands of TSPO. Thus, the permeability transition is an inner membrane event that is regulated by the outer membrane through specific interactions with TSPO.",

Using HPLC/MS methodology and a range of designed hairpin-forming 17-mer oligonucleotides, the kinetics of reaction of a bis-pyrrole PBD conjugate (GWL-78, 2) has been evaluated with eight isomeric oligonucleotides, each containing a single PBD binding site in one of two locations. The PBD-binding base pair triplets were designed to include every possible combination of A and T bases adjacent to the covalently reacting guanine. Contrary to expectations, 2 reacted most rapidly with TGT and TGA sequences, and adducts were observed to form in both the 3'- and the 5'-directions. Molecular modeling studies revealed that for 3'-oriented adducts, this preference could be explained by formation of a hydrogen bond between the N10-H of the PBD and the oxygen of the C2-carbonyl of a thymine base on the 3'-side of the covalently bound guanine. For 5'-adducts, an analogous PBD N10-H hydrogen bond may form instead to the N3 of an equivalent adenine on the opposite strand.",

Valproic acid was ineffective but after switching to lamotrigine and lorazepam, she became seizure-free for five years and stroke-like episodes did not recur. Cerebral MRI initially showed enhanced gyral thickening and a non-enhanced T2-hyperintensity over the left parieto-temporo-occipital white matter and cortex and enhanced caudate heads. After two years without seizures, the non-enhanced hyperintense parieto-temporo-occipital lesion had disappeared, being attributed to consequent seizure control. The caudate heads, however, remained hyperintense throughout the observational period. This case indicates that adequate seizure control in a patient with MELAS syndrome may prevent the recurrence of stroke-like episodes and may result in the disappearance of stroke-like lesions on MRI.",

A key question is whether these mutant receptors also function normally in vivo. Perturbation of brain function was evaluated by gene expression profiling in the cerebral cortex and by behavioral pharmacology experiments with GABAergic drugs. Analysis of individual transcripts found only six transcripts that were changed in \u03b11 knock-in mice and three in the \u03b12 mutants (p<0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Two transcripts that are sensitive to neuronal activity, Arc and Fos, increased about 250% in the \u03b12 mutants, and about 50% in the \u03b11 mutants. Behavioral effects (loss of righting reflex, rotarod) of flurazepam and pentobarbital were not different between \u03b12 mutants and wild-type, but they were enhanced for \u03b11 knock-in mice. These results indicate that introduction of these mutations in the \u03b12 subunit of the GABAA receptor does not produce marked perturbation of brain function, as measured by gene expression and GABAergic behavioral responses, but the same mutations in the \u03b11 subunit produce more pronounced changes, especially in GABAergic function.",

    "124": "Second generation antipsychotics are commonly prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia, however some can induce metabolic dysfunction side-effects such as weight gain, obesity and diabetes. Clinical reports suggest olanzapine alters satiety signals, although findings appear conflicting. Previous animal model studies have utilised a range of olanzapine dosages, however the dosage that better mimics the human scenario of olanzapine-induced weight gain is unclear. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally, three times daily with olanzapine (0.25mg/kg, 0.5mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg, 2.0mg/kg), self-administered in a sweet cookie dough pellet at eight-hourly intervals) or vehicle (n=12/group) for 14-days. Olanzapine orally self-administered in multiple doses (eight-hourly intervals) may circumvent a drop in plasma drug concentration and ensure the maintenance of a consistently high olanzapine level in the rat. Olanzapine increased body weight (0.5mg/kg, 1.0mg/kg, 2.0mg/kg), food intake (2.0mg/kg) and feeding efficiency (0.5-2.0mg/kg), with no effect on water intake. Subcutaneous inguinal (1.0mg/kg, 2.0mg/kg) and intra-abdominal perirenal fat were increased (2.0mg/kg), but not interscapula brown adipose tissue. Olanzapine increased circulating ghrelin and cholecystokinin, but had no effect on peptide YY((3-36)). Olanzapine decreased insulin (0.25-2.0mg/kg) and locomotor activity in the open field arena (0.5-2.0mg/kg). A low dosage of 0.25mg/kg olanzapine had no effect on most parameters measured. Olanzapine-induced weight gain is associated with hyperphagia, enhanced feeding efficiency and adiposity, decreased locomotor activity and altered satiety signaling. The animal model used in the present study of self-administered oral olanzapine treatment (t.i.d.) at a dosage range of 0.5-2.0mg/kg (but not 0.25mg/kg) mimics aspects of the clinic.", 
    "125": "Benzodiazepines (BZs), which are typically used as anxiolytics, act by modulating inhibitory signaling through gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA)(A) receptors. Functionally, the inhibitory effects of GABA may be counterbalanced by the excitatory effects of glutamate (Glu) as the two neurotransmitter systems are metabolically linked through their synthetic intermediate glutamine (Gln). The primary aim of this study was to determine whether the effects of different BZs on the GABA and Glu/Gln systems would vary according to the pharmacokinetics of the different drugs. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) was used to measure GABA, Glu, and Gln levels in six healthy adult volunteers 1h and 10 h following immediate release alprazolam, extended release alprazolam, clonazepam, or placebo. Although there were no differences between 1 and 10 h when the drugs were examined individually, there was a trend level difference between the 1- and 10-h effects of BZs on Gln when the BZs were combined. In post-hoc comparisons, the difference in the Gln to creatine (Cr) ratio was 0.04 for the BZs versus placebo at 1h and 0.01 at 10h following the administration of drug (t(11)=2.49, P=0.03 1 h; t(10)=0.65, P=0.53 10 h; no correction for multiple comparisons). An increase in Gln/Cr at 1 h post-BZ is consistent with a functionally synergistic relationship between Glu/Gln and GABA in the brain. It also suggests that MRS may have sufficient sensitivity to detect acute drug effects.", 
    "126": "The BTBR T+ tf/J (BTBR) inbred mouse strain displays a low sociability phenotype relevant to the first diagnostic symptom of autism, deficits in reciprocal social interactions. Previous studies have shown that BTBR mice exhibit reduced social approach, juvenile play, and interactive behaviors. The present study evaluated the behavior of the BTBR and C57BL/6J (B6) strains in social proximity. Subjects were closely confined and tested in four experimental conditions: same strain male pairs (Experiment 1); different strain male pairs (Experiment 2); same strain male pairs and female pairs (Experiment 3); same strain male pairs treated with an anxiolytic (Experiment 4). Results showed that BTBR mice displayed decreased nose tip-to-nose tip, nose-to-head and upright behaviors and increased nose-to-anogenital, crawl under and crawl over behaviors. These results demonstrated avoidance of reciprocal frontal orientations in the BTBR, providing a parallel to gaze aversion, a fundamental predictor of autism. For comparative purposes, Experiment 3 assessed male and female mice in a three-chamber social approach test and in the social proximity test. Results from the three-chamber test showed that male B6 and female BTBR displayed a preference for the sex and strain matched conspecific stimulus, while female B6 and male BTBR did not. Although there was no significant interaction between sex and strain in the social proximity test, a significant main effect of sex indicated that female mice displayed higher levels of nose tip-to-nose tip contacts and lower levels of anogenital investigation (nose-to-anogenital) in comparison to male mice, all together suggesting different motivations for sociability in males and females. Systemic administration of the anxiolytic, diazepam, decreased the frequency of two behaviors associated with anxiety and defensiveness, upright and jump escape, as well as crawl under behavior. This result suggests that crawl under behavior, observed at high levels in BTBR mice, is elicited by the aversiveness of social proximity, and possibly serves to avoid reciprocal frontal orientations with other mice.",

Haloperidol and aripiprazole, but not olanzapine, reduced perseverative over-responding, while anticipatory responding was best controlled by olanzapine.

Treatment with a 10 mg daily dose of aripiprazole was associated with the lowest incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and showed no significant weight gain.

Although the roles of TRH- and TSH-stimulated signaling in these endocrine glands are well understood, these receptors are expressed in other sites and their roles in these extraglandular tissues are less well known. Moreover, one of the two subtypes of TRH receptors (TRH-R2) and the single TSH receptor (TSHR) exhibit constitutive signaling activity and the roles of constitutive signaling by these receptors are poorly understood.

This study assessed effects of drugs' plasma protein binding and tissue distribution on volume of drug distribution and identified the most appropriate ways for its calculation. Effects of the distribution factors on the unbound and total drug plasma concentrations and on the corresponding volumes of distribution were studied using pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation approach based on in vitro and in vivo concentration vs. time data of diazepam, a model drug with extensive plasma protein binding and tissue distribution. Pharmacokinetics of diazepam were appropriately described by three-compartment pharmacokinetic model that incorporated the processes of plasma protein binding and tissue permeation. According to this model, displacement of the drug from plasma proteins increases the unbound (but not the total) plasma concentrations and induces faster drug elimination from the body. The distribution pattern of the drug in the body and the time course of unbound (pharmacologically active) drug concentrations correlated with the unbound volumes of distribution, but not with the total volumes of distribution. In conclusion, unbound volumes of distribution appropriately describe the drug distribution pattern and the time course of unbound drug concentrations and are recommended for use as primary pharmacokinetic parameters in pharmaceutical research.",

    "143": "The prototypic benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are not only anxiolytic but also produce sedation. These effects are mediated by GABA(A) receptors containing either an \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13 or \u03b15 subunit at which the positive modulatory effects (i.e., agonist efficacy) of benzodiazepines are mediated via a specific benzodiazepine recognition site. Recent molecular genetic and pharmacological data point to \u03b11-containing GABA(A) receptors as the \"sedative\" and \u03b12- and/or \u03b13-containing receptors as the \"anxiolytic\" subtype(s). Therefore, at Merck Sharp & Dohme attempts were made to identify subtype-selective compounds that modulate \u03b12/\u03b13 but not \u03b11 receptor function with the prediction that such compounds would be non-sedating anxiolytics. The initial strategy for discovering such \"anxioselective\" compounds focussed on producing compounds with much higher affinity at the \u03b12/\u03b13 compared to \u03b11 subtypes. The starting point for this approach was the triazolophthalazine series developed from a combination of a screening hit and a literature compound [1]. However, the maximum \u03b13 versus \u03b11 binding selectivity that could be achieved in this series was 12-fold and this was not considered sufficient for an appropriate in vivo pharmacological differentiation compared to non-selective compounds. Nevertheless, within this series compounds demonstrating (albeit to a limited extent) higher agonist efficacy at the \u03b13 versus \u03b11 subtype were also identified. This suggested that it might be possible to synthesize a compound with higher efficacy at the \u03b12 and/or \u03b13 compared to \u03b11 subtypes, ideally with no efficacy at the latter subtype (i.e., a compound with subtype-selective efficacy). By changing the structure from a triazolophthalazine to a triazolopyridazine core, a number of either pharmacological tool compounds (L-838417, MRK-067 and MRK-696) or clinical development candidates (MRK-409 and TPA023) were identified. Encouraged by the success of this approach and the observation that the benzimidazole NS-2710 had a modest degree of \u03b13 versus \u03b11 selectivity efficacy, a structurally-related class of imidazopyridines was also explored. The introduction of an additional nitrogen into the imidazopyridine core gave the imidazopyrimidine series which initially had issues with poor dog pharmacokinetics. However, this was resolved and resulted in the identification of the development candidates MRK-623 and MRK-898. A fluoroimidazopyridine was found to be a bioisostere of the imidazopyrimidine core and in this series the \u03b13-selective tool compound TP003 was identified. The addition of a further nitrogen into the imidazopyrimidine core produced the imidazotriazine series, which yielded the clinical candidate TPA023B. Imidazopyrazinone and imidazotriazinone compounds offered no advantages over their respective imidazopyrimidine and imidazotriazine analogues. Additional pharmacological tool compounds were identified within the pyridine, pyrazolotriazine, pyridazine and pyrazolopyridone series highlighting the general feasibility of GABA(A) receptor subtype selective efficacy as a strategy for developing compounds with novel in vitro and in vivo profiles.", 
    "144": "Benzodiazepine site agonists (such as diazepam) are well-known to impair cognition. Since benzodiazepines exert their effects via modulation of \u03b11-, \u03b12-, \u03b13- and \u03b15-containing GABA(A) receptors, the cognition-impairing effects of diazepam must be associated with one or several of these subtypes. Of these different subtypes, \u03b15-containing GABA(A) receptors represent an attractive option as the \"cognition\" subtype based upon the preferential localization of these receptors within the hippocampus and the well-established role of the hippocampus in learning and memory. As a result, it is hypothesized that an inverse agonist selective for the \u03b15 subtype should enhance cognition. For example, L-655708, a partial inverse agonist with 50-100-fold higher affinity for the \u03b15 relative to the \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 subtypes of GABA(A) receptors, enhanced cognitive performance in rats. Unfortunately, however, pharmacokinetic properties of this compound prevented it being developed further. In order to try achieve binding selectivity in a series structurally distinct from the imidazobenzodiazepines, the group at Merck, Sharp & Dohme commenced studies within the triazolopyridazine series. Although a degree of binding selectivity could be achieved (a maximum of 22-125-fold for \u03b15 versus \u03b11, \u03b12 or \u03b13) this approach was dropped in favour of a strategy to identify compounds with either a combination of selective affinity and selective efficacy or purely selective efficacy. With respect to the former, screening of the Merck chemical collection identified a novel, moderately \u03b15-binding selective thiophene series and further optimization of this series produced MRK-536, which demonstrated a modest \u03b15 binding selectivity (~10-fold) as well as \u03b15-efficacy selectivity. However, the structure-activity relationship within this and the analogous tetralone series proved unpredictable and these series were not pursued further. The success of the selective efficacy approach on the \u03b12/\u03b13-selective agonist project led a similar paradigm being adopted for the \u03b15 project. The starting point for this strategy was the triazolopyridazine 3 which, like MRK-536, possessed a degree of both \u03b15 binding- and efficacy-selectivity. By changing the core from a triazolopyridazine to a triazolophthalazine structure, \u03b15 binding selectivity was lost but with subsequent optimization, compounds with the desired profile (low or antagonist efficacy at the \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 subtypes and marked inverse agonism at \u03b15-containing receptors) could be achieved, allowing the clinical candidate \u03b15IA as well as the structurally-related pharmacological tool compound \u03b15IA-II to be identified. By appending features of the prototypic \u03b12/\u03b13-selective triazolopyridazine L-838417 (t-butyl and 1,2,4 triazole) along with the isoxazole of \u03b15IA to a pyrazolotriazine core, an additional clinical candidate, MRK-016, was identified. Finally, a degree of \u03b15 efficacy selectivity was achieved the pyridazine series but metabolic instability within this chemotype limited its further optimization. Overall, these studies demonstrate the feasibility of adopting a selective efficacy approach in the identification of \u03b15 selective GABA(A) receptor inverse agonists.",

The otherwise inaccessible and unknown 2,2-dimethyl-4-aryl-1,5-benzodiazepines 8 were also prepared in an analogous manner. The reaction mechanism was investigated by means of DFT calculations. Structural assignments of the new compounds as well as complete assignment of (1)H and (13)C NMR signals have been unambiguously achieved on the basis of the analysis of their (1)H and (13)C NMR (1D and 2D), IR, MS, and elemental analysis data, whereas the presence of an amino group in 5 and of a hydroxyl in 6 was confirmed by derivatization. Compounds 2, 3, 5f, 6a, 6c, 6d, 6f, 6h, 8c, and 12 were evaluated as antioxidants and lipid peroxidation inhibitors in vitro. Compound 6f was also evaluated as anti-inflammatory agent in vivo.

    "146": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability, but no pharmacological therapy is currently available for promoting recovery. The brain region adjacent to stroke damage-the peri-infarct zone-is critical for rehabilitation, as it shows heightened neuroplasticity, allowing sensorimotor functions to re-map from damaged areas. Thus, understanding the neuronal properties constraining this plasticity is important for the development of new treatments. Here we show that after a stroke in mice, tonic neuronal inhibition is increased in the peri-infarct zone. This increased tonic inhibition is mediated by extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors and is caused by an impairment in GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) transporter (GAT-3/GAT-4) function. To counteract the heightened inhibition, we administered in vivo a benzodiazepine inverse agonist specific for \u03b15-subunit-containing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors at a delay after stroke. This treatment produced an early and sustained recovery of motor function. Genetically lowering the number of \u03b15- or \u03b4-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors responsible for tonic inhibition also proved beneficial for recovery after stroke, consistent with the therapeutic potential of diminishing extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor function. Together, our results identify new pharmacological targets and provide the rationale for a novel strategy to promote recovery after stroke and possibly other brain injuries.",

Seven patients experienced cisplatin-induced vomiting despite antiemetic therapy including 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) (5-HT(3)) antagonist and dexamethasone. Therefore, the antiemetic therapy including clonazepam, 5-HT(3) antagonist and dexamethasone was subsequently explored in the next course for the same seven patients. We administered clonazepam (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) once a day orally for 5 d from day one prior to chemotherapy. The grade of delayed vomiting, evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0, in the courses of therapy with clonazepam was significantly lower than without clonazepam (p=0.013). The patients whose serum clonazepam concentrations were below the lower limit of detection (3.0 ng/ml) experienced vomiting in three of three courses, whereas the patients whose serum clonazepam concentrations were higher than 4.3 ng/ml experienced no vomiting in six of seven courses. We observed that the symptom of cisplatin-induced delayed vomiting is controlled with serum clonazepam levels in the order of 10.0 ng/ml.",

The subjects were 31 patients, they were diagnosed with schizophrenia on the basis of the criteria of the DSM-IV. Clinical symptoms were assessed using Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and cognitive function was assessed using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Keio Version: KWCST) and the St. Marianna University School of Medicine's Computerized Memory Test (STM-COMET) as executive function and memory/attention function tests at baseline and 8 weeks after switching. As a result, comparison of the BPRS mean total score revealed no significant difference between aripiprazole and the other medications. Aripiprazole resulted in significant changes in the number of categories achieved (CA) and difficulty maintaining set (DMS) compared to olanzapine at the second level of the KWCST. Comparison thus revealed no difference in clinical effect between aripiprazole and the other medications, but might suggest possible differences between aripiprazole and olanzapine in the profiles of the improvement effects on executive function, memory, and attention function.",

Typical anxiolytics or antidepressants with different mechanisms, fluvoxamine (30 mg/kg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), bupropion (60 mg/kg, noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor), imipramine (60 mg/kg, tricyclic antidepressant) and diazepam (10 mg/kg, benzodiazepine) were used to examine whether these behavioral parameters are sensitive to pharmacological treatments. Each of the drugs demonstrated an individual action pattern on the 4 behavioral parameters (latency to the first digging, exploration around marbles, rearing and locomotor activity). On the other hand, all 4 drugs reduced burying marbles and digging, which were correlated with each other. These results suggest that the former 4 behavioral parameters are sensitive to pharmacological treatment and that pharmacological regulation mechanisms of them may be different from burying marbles and digging.

In this study, we explored the differences in serum BDNF levels, measured at baseline and 1 week after alcohol withdrawal among alcoholic patients with and without DT.", 
    "202": "Sixty-five inpatients, fulfilling the DSM-IV criteria of alcohol dependence and admitted for alcohol detoxification, as well as 39 healthy control subjects were enrolled. The alcoholic patients were divided by the appearance of DTs into the DT group (n = 25) and non-DT group (n = 40). We collected blood samples of the patient groups on the first and seventh days of alcohol withdrawal and measured serum BDNF levels by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.", 
    "203": "Serum BDNF levels differed significantly among the three groups: (i) control group 14.8 \u00b1 4.7 ng/ml; (ii) non-DT group 12.3 \u00b1 3.3 ng/ml; (iii) DT group 6.2 \u00b1 2.6 ng/ml (p < 0.001). One week after alcohol withdrawal, the BDNF levels increased significantly for both alcoholic groups. While non-DT group had comparable BDNF levels (13.4 \u00b1 3.5 ng/ml) with controls, the DT group still exhibited lower levels (8.9 \u00b1 4.4 ng/ml).", 
    "204": "This study suggests chronic drinking leads to a reduction in BDNF levels, and patients with more deficient BDNF expression are vulnerable to the development of DTs. Additionally, BDNF levels elevated after prompt alcohol detoxification treatment. These findings indicate that BDNF could involve modifying the phenotypes of AWS as well as the pertinent neuroadaptive processes of alcohol dependence.", 
    "205": "previous studies on non-cardiac surgical patients have shown that cerebral pressure-flow autoregulation and cerebral flow-metabolism coupling are maintained with sevoflurane. The effects of sevoflurane on cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation and flow-metabolism coupling during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have not been studied previously.", 
    "206": "the effects of sevoflurane-induced burst suppression, monitored with electroencephalography (EEG), on cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV), cerebral oxygen extraction (COE) and flow autoregulation, were studied in 16 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The experimental procedure was performed during non-pulsatile CPB with mild hypothermia (34\u2003degreesC) in fentanyl/droperidol-anesthetized patients. Middle cerebral artery transcranial Doppler flow velocity, right jugular vein bulb oxygen saturation and jugular venous pressure were measured continuously. Autoregulation was tested during changes in the mean arterial pressure (40-90 mmHg), induced by sodium nitroprusside and norepinephrine before (control), and during additional sevoflurane administration, in a dose that resulted in an EEG burst-suppression level of 4-6/min.", 
    "207": "sevoflurane, at an inspired concentration of 3.36 \u00b1 0.03%, induced a 17% decrease in CBFV (P<0.05) and a 22% decrease in COE (P<0.05) compared with the control. The slope of the positive relationship between CBFV and cerebral perfusion pressure was steeper with sevoflurane (p<0.01) compared with control measurements, as was the slope of the negative relationship between cpp and coe (p<0.01).", 
    "208": "burst-suppression doses of sevoflurane exert an intrinsic cerebral vasodilatory effect, which impairs CBF autoregulation during mildly hypothermic CPB. Furthermore, during sevoflurane administration, CBF is in excess relative to oxygen demand, indicating a partial loss of the cerebral flow-metabolism coupling.", 
    "209": "A series of tetrahydro-1 H-1,4-diazepines 4a-c, dihydro-1 H-1,4-diazepine 5 and pyrido diazepines 8 and 10 was prepared. Originated form dehydroacetic acid (DHA) and aromatic aldehydes cinnamoyl compounds 3a-c were obtained and converted with ethylenediamine to give tetrahydro-1H-1,4-diazepines 4a-c. For the synthesis of pyrido[1,2-d][1,4]diazepines 8 and 10 a new snythetic approach is described. Compounds 4b and 5 were investigated concerning their affinity to different benzodiazepine receptor subtypes. The determined IC50 values for 5 are 1.5 microM and 1.1 microM at 10 microM respectively.", 
    "210": "Current assessment of drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction success is based on whether predictions fall within a two-fold range of the observed data. This strategy results in a potential bias toward successful prediction at lower interaction levels [ratio of the area under the concentration-time profile (AUC) in the presence of inhibitor/inducer compared with control is <2]. This scenario can bias any assessment of different DDI prediction algorithms if databases contain large proportion of interactions in this lower range. Therefore, the current study proposes an alternative method to assess prediction success with a variable prediction margin dependent on the particular AUC ratio. The method is applicable for assessment of both induction and inhibition-related algorithms. The inclusion of variability into this predictive measure is also considered using midazolam as a case study. Comparison of the traditional two-fold and the new predictive method was performed on a subset of midazolam DDIs collated from previous databases; in each case, DDIs were predicted using the dynamic model in Simcyp simulator. A 21% reduction in prediction accuracy was evident using the new predictive measure, in particular at the level of no/weak interaction (AUC ratio <2). However, inclusion of variability increased the prediction success at these levels by two-fold. The trend of lower prediction accuracy at higher potency of DDIs reported in previous studies is no longer apparent when predictions are assessed via the new predictive measure. Thus, the study proposes a more logical method for the assessment of prediction success and its application for induction and inhibition DDIs.", 
    "211": "Using the guide of a competitive assay for the benzodiazepine binding site in the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)), two active diterpenes were isolated from the aerial parts of Aloysia virgata (Ru\u00edz & Pav\u00f3n) A.L. Jussieu var. platyphylla (Briquet) Moldenke. These compounds, identified as (16R)-16,17,18-trihydroxyphyllocladan-3-one (1) and (16R)-16,17-dihydroxyphyllocladan-3-one (2) on the basis of spectral data, competitively inhibited the binding of [(3)H]-FNZ to the benzodiazepine binding site with K(i)\u00b1S.E.M. values of 56\u00b119 \u03bcM and 111\u00b113 \u03bcM, respectively. The behavioral actions of these diterpenes, intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered in mice, were examined in the plus-maze, holeboard, locomotor activity and light/dark tests. Compound 1 exhibited anxiolytic-like effects in mice evidenced by a significant increase of the parameters measured in the holeboard test (the number of head dips at 0.3 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, the rears at 1 mg/kg and the time spent head-dipping at 3 mg/kg), in the plus-maze assay (the percentage of open arm entries at 1 mg/kg) and in the light/dark test (the time in light and the number of transitions at 1 mg/kg). Compound 2 augmented the number of rearings in the holeboard apparatus (at 0.3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg) and the locomotor activity (at 1 mg/kg). These results reveal the presence of neuroactive compounds in Aloysia virgata."
