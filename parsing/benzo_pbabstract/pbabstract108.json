This study recruited drug-naive volunteers to assess the subjective effects of multiple doses of zolpidem (0, 5, 10, or 20 mg) administered in a within-subject double-blind design. Participants (n=11) answered computerized questionnaires (Addiction Research Center Inventory, visual analog scales, and a hypothetical Drug versus Money Choice) to address the hypothesis that a supratherapeutic dose (20 mg) would increase ratings of abuse-related subjective effects, while lower therapeutic doses (5 and 10 mg) would not. Although participants rated some effects as negative at 10 and 20 mg, the highest dose engendered predominantly positive abuse-like effects such as 'High', 'Like', and 'Good Effects'. However, no dose of zolpidem was chosen over money ($0.35-$10) when participants made hypothetical choices between them. Results suggest that although individuals without a drug abuse history are not inclined to choose zolpidem when presented with an alternative reinforcer such as money, it may possess moderate abuse potential that limits its clinical utility.", 
    "1": "Synchronous bursting of cortical GABAergic interneurons is important in epilepsies associated with excitatory GABAergic signalling. If electrical coupling was critical for the generation of this pathological activity, then the development of selective blockers of connexin36-based interneuronal gap junctions could be of therapeutic value. We have addressed this issue in the 4-aminopyridine model of epilepsy in vitro by comparing GABAergic epileptiform currents and their sensitivity to gap junction blockers in wild-type vs. connexin36 knockout mice. Although electrical coupling was abolished in stratum lacunosum-moleculare interneurons from knockout animals, epileptiform currents were not eliminated. Furthermore, epileptiform currents propagated similarly across hippocampal layers in the two genotypic groups. Blockade of electrical coupling with carbenoxolone suppressed amplitude, frequency and half-width of the epileptiform currents both in wild-type and in knockout animals, whereas mefloquine had no effects. Carbenoxolone also depressed responses to exogenous and synaptic GABA application onto interneurons. We conclude that, in the 4-aminopyridine model of epilepsy in vitro, connexin36 is not critical for the generation of epileptiform discharges in GABAergic networks and that the observed antiepileptic effects of carbenoxolone are likely to be due to blockade of GABAA receptors and not of connexin36-based gap junctions. Lastly, because of its chemical structure and its effects on amplitude and kinetics of GABAergic currents, we tested the hypothesis that carbenoxolone acted via specific sites on GABAA receptors, such as the one mediating the effects of the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate, or the allosteric regulatory site of benzodiazepines/\u03b2-carbolines. Our results suggest that neither of these is involved.", 
    "2": "The large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channel (BK channel) and its smooth muscle-specific \u03b21 subunit regulate excitation\u2013contraction coupling in many types of smooth muscle cells. However, the relative contribution of BK channels to control of M2- or M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor mediated airway smooth muscle contraction is poorly understood. Previously, we showed that knockout of the BK channel \u03b21 subunit enhances cholinergic-evoked trachea contractions. Here, we demonstrate that the enhanced contraction of the BK \u03b21 knockout can be ascribed to a defect in BK channel opposition of M2 receptor-mediated contractions. Indeed, the enhanced contraction of \u03b21 knockout is eliminated by specific M2 receptor antagonism. The role of BK \u03b21 to oppose M2 signalling is evidenced by a greater than fourfold increase in the contribution of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels to contraction that otherwise does not occur with M2 antagonist or with \u03b21 containing BK channels. The mechanism through which BK channels oppose M2-mediated recruitment of calcium channels is through a negative shift in resting voltage that offsets, rather than directly opposes, M2-mediated depolarization. The negative shift in resting voltage is reduced to similar extents by BK \u03b21 knockout or by paxilline block of BK channels. Normalization of \u03b21 knockout baseline voltage with low external potassium eliminated the enhanced M2-receptor mediated contraction. In summary, these findings indicate that an important function of BK/\u03b21 channels is to oppose cholinergic M2 receptor-mediated depolarization and activation of calcium channels by restricting excitation\u2013contraction coupling to more negative voltage ranges.", 
    "3": "Having failed to respond to an adequate antidepressant treatment course predicts poorer treatment outcomes in patients with major depression. However, little is known about the impact of prior treatment on the outcome of major depression with psychotic features (MDpsy). We examined the effect of prior treatment history on the outcome of pharmacotherapy of MDpsy in patients who participated in the STOPD-PD study, a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial comparing a combination of olanzapine plus sertraline vs. olanzapine plus placebo. The strength of treatment courses received prior to randomization was classified using a validated method. A hierarchy of outcomes was hypothesized based on treatments received prior to randomization and randomized treatment. A high remission rate was observed in subjects with a history of no prior treatment or inadequate treatment who were treated with a combination of olanzapine and sertraline. A low remission rate was observed in subjects who had previously failed to respond to an antidepressant alone and who were treated with olanzapine monotherapy. A low remission rate was also observed in subjects who had previously failed to respond to a combination of an antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Similar to patients with major depression, these results emphasize the impact of prior pharmacotherapy on treatment outcomes in patients with MDpsy.",

The present study sought at examining the density and affinity of two proteins related to neurotransmission and cell metabolism, the serotonin transporter SERT and the cholesterol import-benzodiazepine site TSPO (translocator protein), in a rodent leptin-lacking mutant, the obese ob/ob mouse. Binding studies were thus carried out in brain or peripheral tissues, blood platelets (SERT) and kidneys (TSPO), of ob/ob and WT mice supplied with a standard diet, using the selective radiochemical ligands [3H]-paroxetine and [3H]-PK11195.", 
    "5": "We observed comparable SERT number or affinity in brain and platelets of ob/ob and WT mice, whilst a significantly higher [3H]-PK11195 density was reported in the brain of ob/ob animals. TSPO binding parameters were similar in the kidneys of all tested mice. By [3H]-PK11195 autoradiography of coronal hypothalamic-hippocampal sections, an increased TSPO signal was detected in the dentate gyrus (hippocampus) and choroids plexus of ob/ob mice, without appreciable changes in the cortex or hypothalamic-thalamic regions.", 
    "6": "These findings show that TSPO expression is up-regulated in cerebral regions of ob/ob leptin-deficient mice, suggesting a role of the translocator protein in leptin-dependent CNS trophism and metabolism.

    "7": "It has been previously reported that treatment of urinary oxazepam by commercial \u03b2-glucuronidase enzyme preparations, from Escherichia coli, Helix pomatia and Patella vulgata, results in production of nordiazepam (desmethyldiazepam) artefact. In this study, we report that this unusual reductive transformation also occurs in other benzodiazepines with a hydroxyl group at the C3 position such as temazepam and lorazepam. As determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, all three enzyme preparations were found capable of converting urinary temazepam into diazepam following enzymatic incubation and subsequent liquid-liquid extraction procedures. For example, when H. pomatia enzymes were used with incubation conditions of 18 h and 50 \u00b0C, the percentage conversion, although small, was significant--approximately 1% (0.59-1.54%) in both patient and spiked blank urines. Similarly, using H. pomatia enzyme under these incubation conditions, a reductive transformation of urinary lorazepam into delorazepam (chlordesmethyldiazepam) occurred. These findings have both clinical and forensic implications. Detection of diazepam or delorazepam in biological samples following enzyme treatment should be interpreted with care.",

Furthermore, CDP-induced anxiolytic-like activity (5 mg/kg i.p.) was antagonized by NMDA (75 mg/kg i.p.) and by an agonist of glycine(B) sites of the NMDA receptor complex, D-serine [100 nmol/mouse intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.)]. The present study showed a positive interaction between \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurotransmission in the anxiolytic-like activity in the elevated plus-maze test in mice and this activity seems to particularly involve the NMDA receptors.",

Extrapyramidal side effects like tardive dyskinesia are known to develop with chronic use of metoclopramide, while acute akathisia is a lesser known side effect following IV administration. Akathisia is characterised by a sensation of restlessness and distress, as well as constant, non-purposeful limb movement. It can present as a diagnostic challenge, cause distress and hinder the management of the primary condition of the patient in the ED. However, akathisia can be readily reversible, with a successful patient outcome if promptly diagnosed. We report a case of acute akathisia in a young female patient after IV bolus metoclopramide was administered to treat her gastroenteritis in our ED. We highlight the diagnostic process, the difficulties in the management of the primary condition resulting from her akathisia and its successful management using IV diphenhydramine and midazolam.",

Effective pharmacologic interventions are needed to ameliorate sleep problems that persist when behavior therapy alone is insufficient. The aim of the present study was to provide an overview of the quantity and quality of pharmacologic research targeting sleep in children with developmental disabilities. Efficacy studies of medications most likely to be prescribed to children are reviewed in detail. Medline and PsychInfo searches were performed to identify relevant clinical trials and case reports, published between 1975 and 2009. Key search terms included sleep, children, antihistamines, alpha adrenergic agonists, antidepressants, antipsychotics, melatonin, ramelteon, benzodiazepines, and nonbenzodiazepines. The literature search identified 58 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Well-controlled studies employing both objective polysomnography and subjective sleep measures are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of currently prescribed pediatric sleep medicines. Melatonin appears to be the most widely assessed agent and safest choice for children with developmental disabilities. Trazodone, mirtazapine, and ramelteon hold promise but require further study.",

Of 79 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition euthymic bipolar patients, 68 were treated with one atypical antipsychotic, quetiapine (n = 12), olanzapine (n = 26), or risperidone (n = 30). Sixteen patients were drug-free. The 4 groups were compared with a sample of drug-na\u00efve patients and a healthy control group (n = 35) on several clinical and neuropsychologic variables, especially on the domains of attention, verbal memory, and executive functions. Euthymia was defined by a score of 6 or less at the Young Mania Rating Scale and a score of 8 or less at the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for at least 6 months.",

The 4 patients groups did not differ in chronicity, age of onset, total number of episodes, and number of hospitalizations. No differences were found regarding antipsychotic dosages between the groups. Bipolar patients performed poorly on most neuropsychologic measures as compared with healthy controls. After controlling for Hamilton Depression Rating Scale symptoms, no significant change in the results was observed. Because many patients with antipsychotic treatment had a history of psychotic symptoms, we performed multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for this variable. Bipolar patients taking 1 of the 3 antipsychotics presented with dose-independent significant deficits in most cognitive tasks compared with healthy controls. After several head-to-head group comparisons, the patients receiving quetiapine showed a better performance in learning task, short-term memory, and recognition task assessed with the California Verbal Learning Test and verbal fluency (P < .05).",

Untreated euthymic patients showed better cognitive performance than did patients on atypical antipsychotics. Some iatrogenic-pharmacologic effect, therefore, cannot be excluded, but quetiapine seemed to be less associated with impairment in measures of verbal memory than olanzapine or risperidone. We suggest to use drugs in bipolar disorder with a lower risk of cognitive adverse effects. However, randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to give a definite answer to this critical problem.",

Multivariate logistic regression and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of benzodiazepine use and dose, respectively. Overall, 54% of the patients received adjunctive benzodiazepines at an average daily dose equivalent to 30.3 mg diazepam, with minor changes over the years sampled. Benzodiazepine use was highest in Taiwan and Japan, lowest in Thailand and China, and was associated with fewer years ill, presence of delusions (OR 1.24), hallucinations (OR 1.22), disorganized speech (OR 1.17), social or occupational dysfunction (OR 1.16), and use of mood stabilizers (OR 3.15), antiparkinsonian (OR 1.79) or antidepressant drugs (OR 1.33), and lower doses of antipsychotics (all p=0.016 to <0.001). Benzodiazepine doses were highest in Taiwan and China, lowest in Korea and Singapore; higher doses were associated with being young, male, physically aggressive, receiving mood stabilizers, and having electroconvulsive treatment (all p=0.019 to <0.001). Benzodiazepine use was associated with neurological and systemic adverse effects. In conclusion, benzodiazepine use was common in Asian patients with schizophrenia. Predictors of benzodiazepine use and dose differed in this population.

Old age depression may also occur after life events: the death of the significant other, economical reasons, health problems (neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, cancer, nutritional deficiency) and can develop into a depressive state. Old age depression is often mistreated, or undertreated, and also underdiagnosed, and this for several reasons: older people reduce their social relations, depression very often presents as a comorbidity with organic diseases (that cover and mask depressive symptoms); finally,the patient may believe that a depressive state is a normal course of life in older people. Recovering from depression is really feasible both in young/adults and in old people, but in older people we can find a higher frequency of admission to hospital, or mortality or suicidality. The depressive symptoms in old age depression is similar to those in adults, however the following aspects require special care, in order to ensure a correct diagnosis despite the presence of comorbidities: - the mood: in contrast with the young and adult, old people often do not complain about their low mood; - the psychotic simptoms: hypocondriacal and psychotic, including hallucinatory symptoms are often present; - the anxiety symptoms: these are often present together with neuro-sensory symptoms; - the somatic symptoms: the comorbidity with organic diseases can mask and overlap the depressive state; - reduction of congnitive functioning: in these cases, which are quite frequent, it is essential to make a differential diagnosis from \"pseudodementia\" and \"dementia\". In conclusion, several factors contribute to the onset of depression in old age, so that we can assert that it is a really a multifactorial disease.",

Although target-compound based analytical strategies are most frequently applied, at some point the information content of the MS-MS spectra becomes relevant. In this article, the positive-ion MS-MS spectra of a wide variety of drugs and related substances are discussed. Starting point was an MS-MS mass spectral library of toxicologically relevant compounds, available on the internet. The positive-ion MS-MS spectra of \u223c570 compounds were interpreted by chemical and therapeutic class, thus involving a wide variety of drug compound classes, such benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, phenothiazines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, diuretics, local anesthetics, vasodilators, as well as various subclasses of anti-diabetic, antidepressant, analgesic, and antihistaminic drugs. In addition, the scientific literature was searched for available MS-MS data of these compound classes and the interpretation thereof. The results of this elaborate study are presented in this article. For each individual compound class, the emphasis is on class-specific fragmentation, as discussing fragmentation of all individual compounds would take far too much space. The recognition of class-specific fragmentation may be quite informative in determining the compound class of a specific unknown, which may further help in the identification. In addition, knowledge on (class-specific) fragmentation may further help in the optimization of the selectivity in targeted analytical approaches of compounds of one particular class.",

This was a prospective, randomized, open-label study. Data for the present investigation were obtained from a large epidemiological and 3-year longitudinal intervention programme of first-episode psychosis conducted at the University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain. One hundred and seventy-four patients were randomly assigned to haloperidol (N\u2009=\u200956), olanzapine (N\u2009=\u200955), or risperidone (N\u2009=\u200963) and followed up for 1 year. The primary effectiveness measure was all causes of treatment discontinuation. Effectiveness analyses were based on intend-to-treat populations. In addition, an analysis based on per protocol populations was conducted in the analysis for clinical efficacy. The treatment discontinuation rate for any cause was higher with haloperidol than with risperidone and olanzapine (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u20098.517; p\u2009=\u20090.014). The difference in discontinuation rate between risperidone and olanzapine was not significant (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u20090.063; p\u2009=\u20090.802). There were no significant advantages of any of the three treatments in reducing the severity of psychopathology. Risperidone and olanzapine demonstrated higher effectiveness relative to haloperidol, but the three antipsychotics were equally effective in reducing the severity of psychopathology. Specific clinical programmes and the use of second-generation antipsychotics may enhance the effectiveness of antipsychotic treatments.",

    "50": "This study investigated the influence of diazepam on the binding characteristics of adrenoceptor, muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors in rat parotid gland membrane using a radioligand binding assay. At a concentration of >10(-6)M, diazepam competed with [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol for \u03b2-adrenoceptor, but not [(3)H]prazosin for \u03b1-adrenoceptor or [(3)H]quinuclidinyl benzilate for muscarinic receptor. Continuous administration of diazepam at doses of 0.4mg/kg/day, i.p. for 7days in rat significantly decreased pilocarpine (4.0mg/kg, i.p.)-induced parotid salivary flow. Diazepam also produced a significant increase in the dissociation constant (Kd) value for [(3)H]dihydroalprenolol binding, but no change in the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) value, and a decrease in the Kd value for [(3)H]diazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors, but no change in the Kd or Bmax values for [(3)H]prazosin or [(3)H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. These results suggest that continuous administration of diazepam modifies affinity for \u03b2-adrenoceptor and benzodiazepine receptor binding sites in parotid gland membrane and that changes in these binding sites may be closely related to diazepam-induced suppression of salivary secretion.", 
    "51": "The (18 kDa) Translocator Protein (TSPO), was initially identified in 1977 as peripheral binding site for the benzodiazepine diazepam and named \"Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)\". It is an evolutionarily well-conserved protein particularly located at the outer/inner mitochondrial membrane contact sites, in closely association with the 32 kDa voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and the 30 kDa adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), thus forming the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). TSPO is ubiquitary expressed in peripheral tissues (steroid producing tissues, liver, heart, kidney, lung, immune system) and in lower levels in the central nervous system, where it is mainly located in glial cells, and in neurons. TSPO is involved in a variety of biological processes such as cholesterol transport, steroidogenesis, calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial oxidation, cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis induction, and regulation of immune functions. In the last decade, many studies have reported that TSPO basal expression is altered in a number of human pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders (Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases), as well as in various forms of brain injury and inflammation and anxiety. Consequently, TSPO has not only been suggested as a promising drug target for a number of therapeutic applications (anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, immunomodulating, etc.), but also as valid diagnostic marker for related-disease state and progression, prompting the development of specific labelled ligands as powerful tools for imaging techniques. A number of structurally different classes of ligands have been reported, showing high affinity and selectivity towards TSPO. Indeed, most of these ligands have been designed starting from selective CBR ligands which were structurally modified in order to shift their affinity towards TSPO. Extensive structure-activity relationship studies were performed allowing to hypothesize various TSPO pharmacophore models. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the structural requirements needed to obtain TSPO ligands with high affinity and selectivity.", 
    "52": "Anxiety modulation often requires pharmaceutical intervention, and though effective in the short-term, benzodiazepines may cause impaired motor function. As a potential alternative, anxiety-modulating effects of a neem leaf (Azadirachta indica, A Juss) extract were investigated using ethological analysis of rat behaviour on an elevated X maze and compared with diazepam treatment. Sexually immature female Sprague-Dawley rats received 0.07 or 7 mg/kg neem leaf steroidal extract, a sham injection, a 1% DMSO/saline vehicle, 2 mg/kg diazepam or no treatment one hour prior to a recorded five-minute exploration of the elevated X maze. Neem matched diazepam in anxiety reduction as both treatments caused a decrease in per cent protected stretched-attend postures (PPSAP). Neem treatment had no effect on closed arm entries or total rears, distinguishing it pharmacologically from diazepam which resulted in a predictable decrease in those locomotor measures. Whereas both neem and diazepam reduced anxiety in complex ethological behavioural indices, only neem produced anxiolysis without motor deficiency.",

    "73": "Tolerance to the anxiolytic-like effect of drugs may develop because of a memory derived from prior experience in certain apparatuses such as the elevated plus-maze (EPM). Activity in basolateral amygdala was shown to be required for consolidating this knowledge. The dorsal hippocampus (DH) is also implicated in long-term memory consolidation, a process relying on new protein synthesis. It is unknown, however, whether the DH protein synthesis disruption would prevent the phenomenon rendering animals unresponsive to benzodiazepines in the EPM retest. To address this, we bilaterally infused the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (ANI) into the rat DH 0, 3 or 6 h after, or 15 min before, the EPM test. DH infusion of ANI (80 \u03bcg) around the time of EPM testing preserved the anxiolysis of the midazolam (MDZ; 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats retested in the EPM 24 h later, suggesting that information consolidated by DH protein synthesis impacts on the subsequent animal's responsiveness to this drug. To examine whether impaired memory acquisition could also contribute to the prevention of MDZ tolerance seen in EPM-experienced animals infused with ANI before testing, the EPM retest was performed 3 h after testing to coincide with the temporal window in which short-term memory remains, for the reason that this process does not require protein synthesis for its formation. The pretest DH anisomycin infusion's ability to prevent the MDZ tolerance on retesting was now missing. This result confirms a specific action of the ANI on memory consolidation. We also found that rats express further avoidance to open-arms in the EPM retest. However, neither pretest nor posttest DH ANI infusion interfered with this pattern of results exhibited by EPM-experienced rats.", 
    "74": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is useful in schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder, but its use is associated with troublesome weight gain and metabolic syndrome. A variety of pharmacological agents has been studied in the efforts to reverse weight gain induced by olanzapine, but current evidence is insufficient to support any particular pharmacological approach. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of metformin for the treatment of olanzapine-induced weight gain. Systematic review of the literature revealed 12 studies that had assessed metformin for antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Of these, four studies (n= 105) met the review inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Meta-analysis was performed to see the effect size of the treatment on body weight, waist circumference and body-mass index (BMI). Weighted mean difference (WMD) for body weight was 5.02 (95% CI 3.93, 6.10) kg lower with metformin as compared with placebo at 12 weeks. For waist circumference, the test for heterogeneity was significant (P= 0.00002, I(2) = 85.1%). Therefore, a random effects model was used to calculate WMD, which was 1.42 (95% CI 0.29, 3.13) cm lower with metformin as compared with placebo at 12 weeks. For BMI, WMD was 1.82 (95% CI 1.44, 2.19) kg\u2003m(-2) lower with metformin as compared with placebo at 12 weeks. Existing data suggest that short term modest weight loss is possible with metformin in patients with olanzapine-induced weight gain.", 
    "75": "Trauma registers show that hypothermia (HT) is an independent risk factor for death during hemorrhagic shock, although experimental animal studies indicate that HT may be beneficial during these conditions. However, the animal models were not designed to detect the expected increase in bleeding caused by HT. In a new model for uncontrolled bleeding, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a standardized femoral artery injury and randomized to either normothermia or HT. Ketamine/midazolam was used to minimize hemodynamic changes due to the anesthesia. The hypothermic rats were cooled to 30\u00b0C and rewarmed again at 90 min. The study period was 3 h. The incidence, onset time, duration, and volume of bleedings as well as hemodynamic and metabolic changes were recorded. There was no difference between groups with respect to the initial bleeding. Rebleedings occurred among 60% of the animals in both groups. Hypothermic rebleeders had more, larger, and longer rebleedings, resulting in a total rebleeding volume amounting to 41% of their estimated blood volume. The corresponding figure for the normothermic rebleeders was 3% (P < 0.001). Total rebleeding volume was significantly larger in the hypothermic group, even at body temperatures greater than 35\u00b0C. We conclude that the risk of rebleeding from a femoral injury is greater in the presence of cooling and HT. The larger rebleeding volumes seen even at body temperatures greater than 35\u00b0C indicate that factors other than temperature-induced coagulopathy also contributed to the increased hemorrhage.",

In this study, we investigated the effect of repetitive administration of diazepam (DZP) on salivary secretion and expression of DBI mRNA and peptide. Moreover, mRNA expression of PBR and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), a transcriptional regulator for DBI promoter, was evaluated after repetitive administration of DZP. Repetitive administration, but not single administration, of 0.4 mg/kg DZP caused inhibition of salivary secretion and enhanced expression of DBI, PACAP, and PBR mRNA in rat salivary gland, with an increase in production of DBI peptide. These results suggest that repetitive administration of DZP stimulates DBI production, which may result in an increase in the suppressive effect of DZP on salivary secretion.",

    "88": "Intense noxious stimuli impair GABAergic inhibition in spinal dorsal horn, which has been proposed as a critical contributor to pathological pain. However, how the reduced inhibition exacerbates the transfer of nociceptive information at excitatory glutamatergic synapses is still poorly understood. The present study demonstrated that one of the striking consequences of GABAergic disinhibition was to enhance the\u00a0function of N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype glutamate receptors (NMDARs), a well-characterized player in central sensitization. We found that intrathecal application of bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, to remove the inhibition readily elicited mechanical allodynia in naive mice, which could be dose-dependently attenuated by NMDARs antagonist D-APV. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that bicuculline did\u00a0not affect the total expression levels of the obligatory NMDARs subunit NR1 and the regulatory subunit NR2A and NR2B. However, bicuculline promoted NR1 phosphorylation at Serine 897 (NR1-S897) by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). This PKA-mediated phosphorylation incorporated NR1 along with NR2B into synapses. When PKA inhibitor H-89 was intrathecally applied, it totally eliminated bicuculline-induced NMDARs phosphorylation, synaptic redistribution as well as pain sensitization. Importantly, the reduced inhibition also operated to enhance NMDARs functions after peripheral inflammation, because spinal injection of diazepam to rescue the inhibition in inflamed mice greatly depressed PKA phosphorylation of NR1-S897, reduced the synaptic concentration of NR1/NR2B and meanwhile, alleviated the inflammatory pain. These data suggested that removal of GABAergic inhibition allowed for PKA-mediated NMDARs phosphorylation and synaptic accumulation, thus exaggerating NMDARs-dependent nociceptive transmission and behavioral sensitization.",

The focus of this paper is on recent neuroimaging evidence in preclinical models as well as clinical experiments. First, we review findings implicating the role of alcohol at the GABA(A)-BZR and discuss the changes in GABA(A)-BZR availability during acute and prolonged alcohol withdrawal. Second, we discuss preclinical evidence that suggests nicotine affects GABA neuronal function indirectly by a primary action at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Third, we show how this evidence converges in studies that examine GABA levels and GABA(A)-BZRs in alcohol-dependent smokers and nonsmokers, suggesting that tobacco smoking attenuates the chemical changes that occur during alcohol withdrawal. Based on a comprehensive review of literature, we hypothesize that tobacco smoking minimizes the changes in GABA levels that typically occur during the acute cycles of drinking in alcohol-dependent individuals. Thus, during alcohol withdrawal, the continued tobacco smoking decreases the severity of the withdrawal-related changes in GABA chemistry.

This has made it difficult to discover ethanol's binding site(s). There are two putative binding sites at \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor subtypes for the proposed ethanol antagonist Ro 15-4513, the established \u03b32 subunit-dependent benzodiazepine site and the recently reported \u03b4 subunit-dependent Ro 15-4513/ethanol binding site. Here, we aimed at clarifying the in vivo role of Ro 15-4513 at these two sites. We found that the antagonism of ethanol actions by Ro 15-4513 in wildtype mice was dependent on the test: an open field test showed that light sedation induced by 1.5-1.8\u2009g/kg ethanol was sensitive to Ro 15-4513, whereas several tests for ethanol-induced anxiolytic effects showed that the ethanol-induced effects were insensitive to Ro 15-4513. Antagonism of ethanol-induced sedation by Ro 15-4513 was unaffected in GABA(A) receptor \u03b4\u2009subunit knockout mice. By contrast, when testing the GABA(A) receptor \u03b32 subunit F77I knock-in mouse line (\u03b32I77 mice) with its strongly reduced affinity of the benzodiazepine sites for Ro 15-4513, we found that the ethanol-induced sedation was no longer antagonized by Ro 15-4513. Indeed, \u03b32I77 mice had only a small proportion of high-affinity binding of [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 left as compared to wildtype mice, especially in the caudate-putamen and septal areas, but these residual sites are apparently not involved in ethanol antagonism. In conclusion, we found that Ro 15-4513 abolished the sedative effect of ethanol by an action on \u03b32 subunit-dependent benzodiazepine sites.", 
    "138": "Cells generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by glycolysis and by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Despite the importance of having sufficient ATP available for the energy-dependent processes involved in immune activation, little is known about the metabolic adaptations that occur in vivo to meet the increased demand for ATP in activated and proliferating lymphocytes. We found that bone marrow (BM) cells proliferating after BM transplantation (BMT) increased aerobic glycolysis but not OXPHOS, whereas T cells proliferating in response to alloantigens during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) increased both aerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS. Metabolomic analysis of alloreactive T cells showed an accumulation of acylcarnitines consistent with changes in fatty acid oxidation. Alloreactive T cells also exhibited a hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), increased superoxide production, and decreased amounts of antioxidants, whereas proliferating BM cells did not. Bz-423, a small-molecule inhibitor of the mitochondrial F(1)F(0) adenosine triphosphate synthase (F(1)F(0)-ATPase), selectively increased superoxide and induced the apoptosis of alloreactive T cells, which arrested established GVHD in several BMT models without affecting hematopoietic engraftment or lymphocyte reconstitution. These findings challenge the current paradigm that activated T cells meet their increased demands for ATP through aerobic glycolysis, and identify the possibility that bioenergetic and redox characteristics can be selectively exploited as a therapeutic strategy for immune disorders.",

Preventing the entry of EBOV into host cells is an attractive antiviral strategy, which has been validated for HIV by the FDA approval of the anti-HIV drug enfuvirtide. To identify inhibitors of EBOV entry, the EBOV envelope glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) gene was used to generate pseudotype viruses for screening of chemical libraries. A benzodiazepine derivative (compound 7) was identified from a high-throughput screen (HTS) of small-molecule compound libraries utilizing the pseudotype virus. Compound 7 was validated as an inhibitor of infectious EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV) in cell-based assays, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 10 \u03bcM and 12 \u03bcM, respectively. Time-of-addition and binding studies suggested that compound 7 binds to EBOV-GP at an early stage during EBOV infection. Preliminary Schr\u00f6dinger SiteMap calculations, using a published EBOV-GP crystal structure in its prefusion conformation, suggested a hydrophobic pocket at or near the GP1 and GP2 interface as a suitable site for compound 7 binding. This prediction was supported by mutational analysis implying that residues Asn69, Leu70, Leu184, Ile185, Leu186, Lys190, and Lys191 are critical for the binding of compound 7 and its analogs with EBOV-GP. We hypothesize that compound 7 binds to this hydrophobic pocket and as a consequence inhibits EBOV infection of cells, but the details of the mechanism remain to be determined. In summary, we have identified a novel series of benzodiazepine compounds that are suitable for optimization as potential inhibitors of filoviral infection.", 
    "140": "We have previously reported that cyclothiazide (CTZ) evokes epileptiform activities in hippocampal neurons and induces seizure behavior. Here we further studied in vivo the sensitivity of the hippocampal CA1 neurons in response to CTZ in epileptogenesis in comparison with two other classic convulsants of kainic acid (KA) and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). CTZ administered intracerebral ventricle (i.c.v.) induced epileptiform activities from an initial of multiple evoked population spikes, progressed to spontaneous spikes and finally to highly synchronized burst activities in hippocampal CA1 neurons. PTZ, when given by subcutaneously, but not by intracerebral ventricle injection, evoked similar progressive epileptiform activities. In contrast, KA given by i.c.v. induced a quick development of epileptiform burst activities and then shortly switched to continuous high frequency firing as acute status epilepticus (ASE). Pharmacologically, alprazolam, a high-potency benzodiazepine ligand, inhibited CTZ and PTZ, but not KA, induced epileptiform burst activities while GYKI 53784, an AMPA receptor antagonist, suppressed CTZ and KA but not PTZ evoked epileptiform activities. In conclusion, CTZ and PTZ induced epileptiform activities are most likely to share a similar progressive pattern in hippocampus with GABAergic mechanism dominant in epileptogenesis, while CTZ model involves additional glutamate receptor activation. KA induced seizure in hippocampus is different to that of both CTA and PTZ. The results from this study indicate that hippocampal neurons respond to various convulsant stimulation differently which may reflect the complicated causes of the seizure in clinics.",

We review the literature on clarithromycin-induced neurotoxicity in adults and present an illustrative case. A total of 38 patients with clarithromycin-induced neurotoxicity have been reported. The average age of patients was 51.3 years (range: 19-87 years) with females comprising 52.6% of patients. Psychiatric illness was the most common comorbidity, while only two patients had renal failure. Clarithromycin had been prescribed for respiratory infections in most patients, and only two patients were receiving more than 1000 mg/day of antibiotic. The symptoms started 1 day to 10 days after starting clarithromycin (mean: 5 days). A total of 71% of patients were under treatment with concomitant medication, and eight patients were undergoing treatment with psychoactive drugs. Patients had a very good outcome after clarithromycin was discontinued, but medication with neuroleptics or benzodiazepine was required for 58% of patients in the acute phase. Only four patients underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG). Our illustrative patient was a 74-year-old woman with clarithromycin-induced delirium due to non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Her clinical symptoms and electroencephalogram (EEG) readings dramatically improved after discontinuation of clarithromycin. The mechanism underlying the central nervous system side effects remains unclear. We suggest including an EEG in the diagnostic procedures of patients under treatment with clarithromycin who develop features of neurotoxicity because an EEG can help to differentiate patients with psychiatric illness from those with encephalopathy or epilepsy. Because of the widespread use of clarithromycin, clinicians should be aware of its neurotoxicity. Early detection of clarithromycin-induced neurotoxicity and discontinuation of the drug may result in full recovery.",

Strategies for mitigating these side effects have been tested, yet effective interventions have not been identified. The current study tested whether two recently identified selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonists would prevent weight gain induced by the antipsychotic olanzapine. Female Sprague-Dawley rats fed a normal chow diet were randomized (n=10 per group) to receive one of the following for 18days: vehicle, olanzapine plus vehicle (2.4mg/kg), olanzapine plus CORT 112716 (20mg/kg), olanzapine plus CORT 112716 (60mg/kg), olanzapine plus CORT 113083 (20mg/kg), or olanzapine plus CORT 113083 (60mg/kg). Rats receiving olanzapine plus CORT 112716 (60mg/kg) or olanzapine plus CORT 113083 (60mg/kg) gained significantly less weight than rats receiving only olanzapine. Both glucocorticoid receptor antagonists significantly attenuated the weight gain induced by olanzapine in a dose dependent manner. Differences in weight gain were not attributable to decreased food intake.", 
    "143": "Recent insights into sleep apnoea pathogenesis reveal that a low respiratory arousal threshold (awaken easily) is important for many patients. As most patients experience stable breathing periods mediated by upper-airway dilator muscle activation via accumulation of respiratory stimuli, premature awakening may prevent respiratory stimuli build up as well as the resulting stabilization of sleep and breathing. The aim of the present physiological study was to determine the effects of a non-benzodiazepine sedative, eszopiclone, on the arousal threshold and the AHI (apnoea/hypopnoea index) in obstructive sleep apnoea patients. We hypothesized that eszopiclone would increase the arousal threshold and lower the AHI in patients with a low arousal threshold (0 to -15 cm H(2)O). Following a baseline overnight polysomnogram with an epiglottic pressure catheter to quantify the arousal threshold, 17 obstructive sleep apnoea patients, without major hypoxaemia [nadir SaO(2) (arterial blood oxygen saturation) >70%], returned on two additional nights and received 3 mg of eszopiclone or placebo immediately prior to each study. Compared with placebo, eszopiclone significantly increased the arousal threshold [-14.0 (-19.9 to -10.9) compared with -18.0 (-22.2 to -15.1) cm H(2)O; P<0.01], and sleep duration, improved sleep quality and lowered the AHI without respiratory event prolongation or worsening hypoxaemia. Among the eight patients identified as having a low arousal threshold, reductions in the AHI occurred invariably and were most pronounced (25\u00b16 compared with 14\u00b14 events/h of sleep; P<0.01). In conclusion, eszopiclone increases the arousal threshold and lowers the AHI in obstructive sleep apnoea patients that do not have marked overnight hypoxaemia. The greatest reductions in the AHI occurred in those with a low arousal threshold. The results of this single night physiological study suggest that certain sedatives may be of therapeutic benefit for a definable subgroup of patients. However, additional treatment strategies are probably required to achieve elimination of apnoea.",

Compulsive opioid use had begun between ages 15 and 31 (mean 20) and had continued from 5 to 26 years. All patients were tobacco smokers, six had also abused amphetamines and 11 benzodiazepines. Relative volumes of cerebral white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces were measured. In addition, Sylvian fissure ratio (SFR), bifrontal ratio, and midsagittal cerebellar vermian area were correlated with the onset age and the duration of opioid abuse.", 
    "146": "The total volume (GM + WM + CSF) of the cerebrum was significantly smaller in patients than in controls (Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.026) as well as the absolute volumes of GM and WM (p = 0.014 and p = 0.007, respectively). There was no significant difference in GM and WM volumes normalized with total cerebral volume. In contrast, the absolute volume of CSF did not significantly differ between the groups, but the relative volume of CSF was significantly higher in opioid dependents (p = 0.029). SFR and bifrontal ratio were larger in opioid dependents than in controls (p = 0.005 and p = 0.013). The SFR correlated negatively (p = 0.017, r = - 0.569) and the area of vermis cerebelli correlated positively (p = 0.043, r = 0.496) with the onset age of opioid abuse. The length of opioid abuse and the area of vermis cerebellum had a negative correlation (p = 0.038, r = - 0.523) even though the areas of cerebellar vermis did not significantly differ between opioid dependents and controls. The authors speculate that the onset of substance abuse in adolescence or early adulthood may have in part disturbed the late brain maturation process, as in normal development, the dorsolateral frontal cortex and superior parts of the temporal lobes are the last to maturate. Also, the cerebellar vermis may be affected by early onset substance abuse. It is possible that the brain is more vulnerable to substance abuse at a young age than later in life.",

These medicines have shown survival benefits in advanced renal cell carcinomas as well as in advanced hepatocellular carcinomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, respectively. The effects of sorafenib and sunitinib on midazolam 1'-hydroxylation catalyzed by human CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 were investigated. Sorafenib and sunitinib inhibited metabolic reactions catalyzed by recombinant CYP3A4. Midazolam hydroxylation was also inhibited in human liver microsomes harboring the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype (poor CYP3A5 expressor). In contrast, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation catalyzed by recombinant CYP3A5 was enhanced by the coexistence of sorafenib or sunitinib in a concentration-dependent manner, with saturation occurring at approximately 10 \u03bcM. Midazolam hydroxylation was also enhanced in human liver microsomal samples harboring the CYP3A5*1/*1 genotype (extensive CYP3A5 expressor). Sorafenib N-oxidation and sunitinib N-deethylation, the primary routes of metabolism, were predominantly catalyzed by CYP3A4 but not by CYP3A5. The preincubation period of sorafenib and sunitinib before the midazolam addition in the reaction mixture did not affect the enhancement of CYP3A5-catalyzed midazolam hydroxylation, indicating that the enhancement was caused by parent sorafenib and sunitinib. Docking studies with a CYP3A5 homology model based on the structure of CYP3A4 revealed that midazolam closely docked to the heme of CYP3A5 compared with sorafenib or sunitinib, suggesting that these anticancer drugs act as enhancers, not as substrates. Our results thus showed that sorafenib and sunitinib activated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation by CYP3A5 but inhibited that by CYP3A4. Unexpected drug interactions involving sorafenib and sunitinib might occur via heterotropic cooperativity of CYP3A5.",

In the present research, we explored the cytogenetic potential of AZ, BZ, and LZ in human lymphocyte cultures, using an expanded sample set, administering the under-investigation medications at final concentrations equivalent to oral dosage. As a biomarker of genotoxicity we used sister chromatid exchanges, one of the most sensitive methods reflecting DNA damage and/or subsequent DNA repair, and as a marker of cytostaticity we estimated the proliferation rate index. After 72\u2009h of incubation in the cultures, all three BDZs caused a concentration-dependent, statistically significant increase of sister chromatid exchange frequency (p\u2009<\u20090.001) followed by a statistically significant decrease of proliferation rate index (p\u2009<\u20090.001) of lymphocytes.

Higher values were observed for smoking (65.0%), clinical or laboratory dyslipidemia (59.1% and 52.0%), careless diet (78.4%), sedentary lifestyle (64.2%), overweight or obesity (64.2%) and abdominal obesity (50.9%). Lower values were observed for hypertension (25.0%), metabolic syndrome (21.9%), diabetes (9.6%) and alcohol abuse (4.0%). An association risk factor exposure and disease was documented (odds ratio, [95% confidence limits]) for smoking (2.47 [1.68-3.64]), laboratory dyslipidemia (1.92 [1.33-2.77]), low HDL-C (2.12 [1.31-3.42]), careless diet (4.46 [2.88-6.90]) and sedentary lifestyle (1.79 [1.22-2.62]). A significant association between antipsychotics that are more likely to induce weight gain and overweight or obesity could not be demonstrated in this study. Hypertension was 46% lower in cases (n = 26/125) than in controls (0.54 [0.34-0.84]). This rather surprising result could be explained by our finding of a negative association (p = 0.01) between blood pressure levels and rate of benzodiazepine prescription among schizophrenia patients. The negative association documented in these patients by multivariate regression analysis (p = 0.005) between hypertension and benzodiazepine prescription reinforces this explanation. Untreated hypertension, untreated dyslipidemia and untreated diabetes are strongly associated with schizophrenia (3.79 [1.63-8.81]), (3.79 [2.06-7.35]), (6.38 [1.725-23.59]), respectively. A significant difference in 10-year absolute risk of fatal cardiovascular disease between cases and controls aged 40 years or more could not be demonstrated in our study (p = 0.054).

These findings call for closer collaboration between psychiatrists and primary care providers. The finding of a lower prevalence of hypertension among cases seems to be associated with an apparent protective effect of benzodiazepines, which are frequently prescribed to patients with schizophrenia in Portugal.", 
    "168": "Insulin signaling to the brain is important not only for metabolic homeostasis but also for higher brain functions such as cognition. GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) decreases neuronal excitability by activating GABA(A) channels that generate phasic and tonic currents. The level of tonic inhibition in neurons varies. In the hippocampus, interneurons and dentate gyrus granule cells normally have significant tonic currents under basal conditions in contrast to the CA1 pyramidal neurons where it is minimal. Here we show in acute rat hippocampal slices that insulin (1 nM) \"turns on\" new extrasynaptic GABA(A) channels in CA1 pyramidal neurons resulting in decreased frequency of action potential firing. The channels are activated by more than million times lower GABA concentrations than synaptic channels, generate tonic currents and show outward rectification. The single-channel current amplitude is related to the GABA concentration resulting in a single-channel GABA affinity (EC(50)) in intact CA1 neurons of 17 pM with the maximal current amplitude reached with 1 nM GABA. They are inhibited by GABA(A) antagonists but have novel pharmacology as the benzodiazepine flumazenil and zolpidem are inverse agonists. The results show that tonic rather than synaptic conductances regulate basal neuronal excitability when significant tonic conductance is expressed and demonstrate an unexpected hormonal control of the inhibitory channel subtypes and excitability of hippocampal neurons. The insulin-induced new channels provide a specific target for rescuing cognition in health and disease.",

This effect has been attributed to conditioned frustration or generalization-decrement processes. The actions of antianxiety drugs in this procedure are most easily interpreted as for reducing the emotional or aversive effects of nonreinforcement. In this study, C57Bl/6 mice were trained to asymptotic performance with food reinforcement on 50 or 100% of six trials in daily sessions. The anxiolytic benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide (15 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or saline was administered before subsequent daily extinction sessions. Under saline, earlier PRF produced an increased resistance to extinction. Drug administration increased resistance to extinction, as measured by start, run and goal times, after either continuous or PRF. These findings are consistent with earlier findings of rats, but different from those obtained with chlordiazepoxide during extinction after operant training with either rats or mice. These findings can be interpreted in terms of frustration, anxiety or generalization-decrement theories of PRF.", 
    "177": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) depress neuronal excitability via positive allosteric modulation of inhibitory GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R). BDZs and other positive GABA(A)R modulators, including barbiturates, ethanol, and neurosteroids, can also inhibit L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-VGCCs), which could contribute to reduced neuronal excitability. Because neuronal L-VGCC function is up-regulated after long-term GABA(A)R modulator exposure, an interaction with L-VGCCs may also play a role in physical dependence. The current studies assessed the effects of BDZs (diazepam, flurazepam, and desalkylflurazepam), allopregnanolone, pentobarbital, and ethanol on whole-cell Ba(2+) currents through recombinant neuronal Ca(v)1.2 and Ca(v)1.3 L-VGCCs expressed with \u03b2(3) and \u03b1(2)\u03b4-1 in HEK293T cells. Allopregnanolone was the most potent inhibitor (IC(50), \u223c10 \u03bcM), followed by BDZs (IC(50), \u223c50 \u03bcM), pentobarbital (IC(50), 0.3-1 mM), and ethanol (IC(50), \u223c300 mM). Ca(v)1.3 channels were less sensitive to pentobarbital inhibition than Ca(v)1.2 channels, similar to dihydropyridine (DHP) L-VGCC antagonists. All GABA(A)R modulators induced a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of Ca(v)1.3 channels, but only BDZs and pentobarbital induced a negative shift in Ca(v)1.2 channel inactivation. Mutation of the high-affinity DHP binding site (T1039Y and Q1043M) in Ca(v)1.2 channels reduced pentobarbital potency. Despite the structural similarity between benzothiazepines and BDZs, mutation of an amino acid important for diltiazem potency (I1150A) did not affect diazepam potency. Although L-VGCC inhibition by BDZs occurred at concentrations that are possibly too high to be clinically relevant and is not likely to play a role in the up-regulation of L-VGCCs during long-term treatment, pentobarbital and ethanol inhibited L-VGCCs at clinically relevant concentrations.",

Drug levels in tissue extracts were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The integrated MSI response was correlated to the LC/MS/MS drug concentrations to determine the amount of drug detected per MSI ion count.

    "193": "Weight gain after olanzapine treatment is associated with lower ghrelin level. Olanzapine is linked to elevated diastolic pressure, TG, and glucose, regardless of the weight gain.", 
    "194": "Nonadherence is still a major problem in the long-term treatment of schizophrenia. Long-acting injectable or depot atypical antipsychotics are associated with better maintenance. Olanzapine pamoate, available since 2010, is the second depot atypical antipsychotic.", 
    "195": "This review covers data on the efficacy and tolerability/safety of olanzapine pamoate, the long-acting formulation of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. Administered as a pamoate salt, it has an elimination half-life of 30 days, allowing a 2- or 4-week injection interval. Antipsychotic efficacy was documented in an 8-week trial in 404 acutely ill schizophrenia patients with maintenance therapy in a 24-week trial in 1065 chronic patients. The side-effect profile is comparable to that of oral olanzapine. The most relevant adverse event is the post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome, occurring at a rate of 0.07% of injections or 1.4% of patients. It requires administration by qualified personnel in settings where a post-injection observation period for 3 h by medical personnel is available.", 
    "196": "Olanzapine pamoate is an efficacious formulation, particularly for patients with a history of good response to oral olanzapine and doubtful adherence. Psychiatrists should reconsider their negative attitudes toward long-acting or depot antipsychotics and should offer this administration to the majority of patients, not only to a negatively selected population.", 
    "197": "Data on the structure, localization, physiology, and pharmacology of GABA receptors are reviewed. These receptors belong to cis-loop receptors and consist of 16 subunits in various combinations and occur in both central nervous system and peripheral organs. There are a great number of their allosteric modulators, agonists and antagonists. Activation of GABA receptors is accompanied by changes in the permeability of plasmatic membranes for chloride ions, which is followed by depolarization (presynaptic inhibition) or hyperpolarization (postsynaptic inhibition). GABA receptors contain some topographically different binding sites, intended for the interaction both with the main mediator (GABA) and with allosteric regulators such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, convulsants, ethanol, and neurosteroids.", 
    "198": "Interoceptive effects of afobazole (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (0.5 and 5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) have been investigated using operant drug discrimination (DD) and passive avoidance \"step through\" state dependent dissociative learning (DL) paradigms in male autobred rats. It is established that afobazole in contrast to classical anxiolytics (diazepam) does not produce the state dependence (DL and DD). In substitution tests, afobazole (20 mg/kg, i.p.) caused saline level responding in diazepam-trained rats and did not influence the general profile of interoceptive diazepam stimulus. The data suggest the absence of overlap in receptor mechanisms of the interoceptive effects of afobazole and diazepam and low probability of drug dependence development after long-term (clinical) afobazole treatment.", 
    "199": "Previous studies have addressed post-operative pain management after ACL reconstruction by examining the use of intra-articular analgesia and/or modification of anesthesia techniques. To our knowledge, however, no previous studies have evaluated the effect of zolpidem on post-operative narcotic requirements, pain, and fatigue in patients undergoing outpatient arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. The purpose of this prospective, blinded, randomized, controlled clinical study was to evaluate the effect of zolpidem on post-operative narcotic requirements, pain, and fatigue in patients undergoing outpatient arthroscopic ACL reconstruction.", 
    "200": "Twenty-nine patients undergoing arthroscopic ACL reconstruction were randomized to a treatment group or placebo group. Both groups received post-operative hydrocodone/acetaminophen bitartrate (Vicodin ES). Patients in the treatment group received a single dose of zolpidem for the first seven post-operative nights. Patients in the placebo group received a gelatin capsule similar in appearance to zolpidem. The amount of Vicodin used in each group, the amount of post-operative pain, and the amount of post-operative fatigue were analyzed.", 
    "201": "Following ACL reconstruction, a 28% reduction was seen in the total amount of narcotic consumed with zolpidem (P\u00a0=\u00a00.047) when compared to placebo. There were no significant differences in post-operative pain or fatigue levels between zolpidem and placebo.", 
    "202": "Adding zolpidem to the post-operative medication regimen after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction helps to lower the amount of narcotic pain medication required for adequate analgesia.", 
    "203": "Randomized controlled clinical trial, Level I.", 
    "204": "Pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) are sequence-selective DNA minor-groove binding agents that covalently bond to guanine with a reported preference for Pu-G-Pu sequences (Pu = Purine). Using HPLC/MS and Circular Dichroism (CD) methodologies, we have established for the first time that the aminal bond formed between PBD molecules and DNA is reversible. Furthermore, we have shown that while the rate of aminal bond cleavage does not depend on the sequence preference of a PBD molecule for a particular binding site, the rate of re-formation of the PBD-DNA adduct does. We have also shown that the PBD anthramycin (2) appears to be an exception to this rule in that, during cleavage from the DNA, its C-ring aromatizes and it cannot then re-attach due to a loss of electrophilicity at the C11-position. Although the C-ring aromatization of anthramycin has been previously reported to occur in the absence of DNA and after treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), in this case no pH lowering was required, with the DNA itself appearing to catalyse the process.", 
    "205": "The ideal combination of premedication for neonatal tracheal intubation has not been established. The aim of this preliminary study was to compare the intubation conditions between propofol and midazolam as premedication for tracheal intubation in neonates.", 
    "206": "A double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial was performed, and 20 preterm neonates (28 to 34 week) underwent tracheal intubation following the use of remifentanil associated to either propofol (n = 10) or midazolam (n = 10). Intubation conditions were scored according to a four-point scale.", 
    "207": "According to the main outcome measured (identification of a 50% difference in the intubation conditions), there were no differences regarding the number of attempts and the overall intubation conditions among the groups (P = 1.00).", 
    "208": "Both combinations of premedications have no differences regarding the quality of intubation, which could be of clinical interest. Besides midazolam, propofol could be a valid alternative as hypnotic for premedication for endotracheal intubation in neonates.", 
    "209": "The number of surgical interventions performed in obese patients has recently been increasing. Anaesthesia in a morbidly obese patient may be difficult, due to many pathophysiologic changes and co-morbidities, together with altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anaesthestic agents. We present a case of multimodal preventive analgesia in a bariatric patient with chronic renal failure.", 
    "210": "A 36-year-old, morbidly obese man (BMI 47.8 kg m-2) was scheduled for a laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). The anaesthetic risk was increased because of hypertension, chronic renal failure, steatohepatitis and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. 30 minutes before anaesthesia, the patient received 2 g iv paracetamol. After induction, he was given 8 mg dexamethasone and 100 mg tramadol. All port-sites were infiltrated with 0.5% bupivacaine and adrenaline, both before skin incision, and before wound closure. Since NSAIDs and opioids were contraindicated because of the patient's co-morbidities, postoperative analgesia consisted of tramadol and paracetamol, given alternately, every 3 hours. The patient was discharged home 28 hours after surgery.", 
    "211": "According to the Polish Postoperative Pain Management Recommendations 2008, the pain after LAGB is multifactorial and rated as category 2. The pre-emptive analgesia and postoperative regimen presented in this case can be recommended in similar cases.", 
    "212": "Awake fibreoptic intubation has been recommended for adult patients with a difficult airway in whom anaesthesia and/or relaxation could lead to the \"can not ventilate, can not intubate\" situation. The paper describes three cases of elective awake intubations, as examples of our strategy in cases with a predicted difficult airway.", 
    "213": "Three male patients with Mallampati scores 2, 3 and 3, scheduled for elective surgery, were premedicated with 7.5 mg oral midazolam and 0.5 mg iv atropine. With the patient on the operating table in the anti-Trendelenburg position, the upper airways were anaesthetized with 4 mL of topical 2% lidocaine, administered from a nebulizer via face mask. Additionally, the base of the tongue, nasal cavity and lower throat were sprayed with 10% lidocaine solution. Immediately before insertion of the bronchoscope, the patients received intravenously, 2 mg of midazolam and 0.05-0.1 \u00b5g kg-1 of fentanyl. A 5.2 mm/65 cm fibreoptic bronchoscope was inserted into the trachea and a reinforced endotracheal tube was slid down over it. Oxygen and additional doses of lidocaine were administered through the working channel of the scope.", 
    "214": "The described method is safe and effective, and can be recommended for cases where there is serious doubt about the possibility of maintaining an open airway during induction of anaesthesia, or in cases where intubation has failed during previous anaesthesia. Awake intubation is rarely associated with serious episodes of desaturation and it is usually well tolerated by motivated patients.", 
    "215": "In this study it was possible to measure the distribution of metoprolol, tramadol, and midazolam in human directly in several compartments. In the legal medicine autopsy material is normally investigated to find out the cause of death. But the results of corresponding toxicology measurements often involve more information. With screening methods drugs were detected without connection to the cause of death. The deceased had either a continual therapeutic treatment, a treatment during an operation, or an unsuccessful urgent therapy. A liquid/liquid extraction and a LC/MS/MS method were developed for the determination of the drug concentrations. Different autopsy materials of about 120 cases were investigated. Most frequently the drugs metoprolol, tramadol, and midazolam could be proved and determined simultaneously. Metoprolol was found in seven cases, tramadol in seven cases and midazolam in thirteen cases. The dosage of the drugs was unknown. Therefore and because of the low number of cases statistic calculations were not meaningful and an individual case study was necessary. In all cases with oral metoprolol application the patients probably took a normal customary continuous dosage. The concentrations of tramadol in blood were in the toxic range in three cases. The distribution of tramadol in the compartments was independent of the dosage. The time between oral intake of metoprolol or tramadol and death was unknown. With the distribution pattern of metoprolol in the compartments it was possible to estimate the duration between drug intake and death. In most cases midazolam was given intravenously during an operation or an unsuccessful urgent therapy. Sometimes the time between dosage and death was documented. The duration between application of the drug and death played the crucial role for the distribution of midazolam in the compartments. Measurements of drug concentrations in human autopsy material deepen the knowledge of the respective drugs' pharmacokinetics."
