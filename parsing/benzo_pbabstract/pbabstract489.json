We did it by measuring the acid output as the aggressive factor and we sized the resulting mucosalesions. In the gastric corpus we could not find any change in mucosaprotectionindex after cimetidine, pirenzepine and vagotomy. But in the duodenum protection was increased after pirenzepine and vagotomy.", 
    "1": "Numerous anaesthetic techniques exist for a patient who presents with a difficult endotracheal intubation. They all require an anaesthetic protocol which cannot be improvised. When intubation is expected to be difficult at the pre-anaesthetic examination, the use of a fiberoptic bronchoscope is the technique of choice for intubating adults under local anaesthesia, and children under general anaesthesia. When a fiberoptic bronchoscope is not available, several alternatives can be suggested: local anaesthesia of the glottis, retro-molar and retrograde intubation, or the use of a guide threaded over a lighted stylet; these techniques can be used in an anaesthetized patient breathing spontaneously. In the paralyzed patient impossible to intubate, various trans-laryngeal techniques of ventilation can be used in emergency: jet ventilation via the trans-crico-thyroid route, the use of a cricotomy cannula, or a minitracheotomy set.", 
    "2": "The individual variations in the blood concentrations of gastrocepine, the period of its half-life and clearance in patients with peptic ulcers of the stomach and the duodenal bulb were determined. The patients having combined forms of peptic ulcer with chronic liver diseases exhibited most often an increase of gastrocepine half-life. A new metabolite of gastrocepine was identified by using the chromato-mass-spectral analysis. The specific antibodies to gastrocepine determining the decrease of its concentration in blood and the development of the drug resistance were found.", 
    "3": "Twenty children undergoing surgery received a lumbar block using 0.4 ml/kg mepivacaine 2.0%. They were randomized into two groups, one of which received midazolam 0.4 mg/kg rectally as premedication. Midazolam administration did not significantly influence the plasma concentrations of mepivacaine.", 
    "4": "The effects of oral triazolam 0.25 mg and zopiclone 7.5 mg in 7 supine volunteers were compared by means of quantitative measurements of the EEG, saccadic eye movements, visual analogue scale (VAS) for alertness, critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) and the Maddox wing. Zopiclone reached its maximum effect earlier (62 min) than triazolam (91 min; CFF). On linear regression analysis the average rate constant (regression coefficient) of onset of action of zopiclone was significantly greater than that of triazolam (0.29 vs. 0.17). Triazolam and zopiclone had similar effects, but zopiclone seemed to have a faster onset of action, probably indicating swifter absorption in supine subjects. Quantitative EEG evaluation gave parallel results to the other parameters used, but triazolam and zopiclone showed a dissimilar mechanism of action, as characterized by changes in the alpha frequency.", 
    "5": "A 20-year-old male who attempted suicide by injecting subcutaneously 10 ml of Sistemin 40 (40% dimethoate) was admitted 16 h later. General weakness, muscular fibrillations and a marked inhibition of red blood cell and serum cholinesterases were the prominent signs of intoxication. The antidotal treatment of intermittent boluses of atropine, oxime HI-6 and diazepam was combined with symptomatic therapy. Cholinesterase activity decreased within the next 3 d. In contrast to the marked general improvement of the patient, the return of cholinesterase activities was very slow. The patient was discharged 24 d after the poisoning with no notable consequences which could be ascribed to the intoxication.", 
    "6": "A state exists after the induction of anaesthesia in which patients may be aware of their surroundings yet unable to communicate. This problem of awareness and recall during general anaesthesia is a recent one in the relatively short history of anaesthesia. Prior to the introduction of muscle relaxants in 1942 by Griffith and Johnson, it was felt that \"light anaesthesia\" would be signified by violent movements. Today, the concepts of anaesthetic depth, awareness, and recall have become more complicated with the addition of numerous newer, shorter-acting, intravenous anaesthetic agents with varying effects on the conscious state. Several methods have been described to detect awareness. None has yet been found to be totally reliable and numerous reports of awareness can be found in the literature. Light inhalation and total intravenous anaesthesia have been blamed for the majority of these case reports. However, awareness during total intravenous anaesthesia is avoidable with the proper use of a combination of a hypnotic and an analgesic such as midazolam and alfentanil for general anaesthesia.", 
    "7": "A new technique of sedation for children is described, in which midazolam (0.2 mg.kg-1) was administered topically by the nasal route, followed by ketamine (9.0 mg.kg-1) administered rectally in 32 patients breathing air spontaneously. Sedation was good in 23, seven required further ketamine (1.0 mg.kg-1 i.v.), and in two, halothane was introduced. There was no evidence of severe respiratory depression except during oesophagoscopy. Cardiovascular stability was excellent. Of 21 patients over 5 years old, 19 developed complete and two partial anterograde amnesia for the administration of ketamine and surgery. The major complications were nausea and vomiting (five patients) and salivation (eight patients). The mean recovery time was 40 min (s.d. 33 min). It provided a relatively safe, adaptable, non-invasive method of inducing sedation in children.", 
    "8": "Fourteen patients operated for pheochromocytoma from 1978 to 1988 are reviewed. The preoperative treatment with adrenergic blockers is analyzed: phenoxybenzamine with final doses of 10-140 mg/day (mean 55.4 mg/day) and propranolol with doses of 40-80 mg/day (mean 50 mg/day). The premedications and anesthetic techniques are compared, the use of droperidol being discouraged because of the development of hypertensive paroxysms both preoperatively and postoperatively. The new benzodiazepines are offered as an alternative. The treatment of hypertensive paroxysms with phentolamine with total doses of 2.5-35 mg and that of peroperative arrhythmias with propranolol with total doses of 1-6 mg are reported. The recently described therapeutic approaches are also discussed.", 
    "9": "The cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist MK-329 (previously L364,718) was administered intravenously (IV) (17.5-140 micrograms/kg) to pigs trained to make operant responses for food reinforcements after 4 hr of food deprivation. MK-329 produced a dose-related increase in food intake during the 2-hr test period, with maximum increases occurring at a dose of 70 micrograms/kg. CCK (1 micrograms/kg IV) produced a short-term reduction in feeding and this effect was completely abolished by pretreating the animals with MK-329 (70 micrograms/kg). The present results lend support to the hypothesis that endogenous CCK is involved in satiety.", 
    "10": "The nervous control of arterioles in the guinea-pig submucosal plexus was studied. Outside diameters of arterioles were recorded using a video-monitoring system. Changes in arteriolar diameter in response to electrical stimulation of single neurones or ganglia in the plexus were measured. 2. When the arteriole was pre-constricted with the prostaglandin analogue U46619 or with phenylephrine, electrical stimulation (2-20 Hz, 10 s) of a ganglion dilated the blood vessel. This vasodilatation was abolished by tetrodotoxin or by cutting the fine nerve strands running between the ganglion and the arteriole. 3. The vasodilatations caused by ganglionic stimulation were blocked by the muscarinic antagonists atropine, pirenzepine, (11[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-)-one (AFDX-116), 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) and hexahydrosilodifenidol (HSDF). IC50 values for the inhibition of nerve-evoked vasodilatation by pirenzepine, AFDX-116 and HSDF were 500 nM, 4 microM and 25 nM respectively. Physostigmine (1 microM) increased the dilatation by 90%. 4. Muscarine dilated all submucosal arterioles; the concentration causing half-maximum effects was 200 nM. Muscarinic vasodilatations were inhibited by pirenzepine, AFDX-116, and HSDF in a competitive manner; dissociation equilibrium constants determined by Schild analyses were 125 nM, 1.3 microM and 4 nM respectively. 5. Gossypol, an irreversible inhibitor of the production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), did not reduce the vasodilatation produced by either ganglionic stimulation or muscarine in submucosal arterioles. 6. Intracellular recordings were made from submucosal neurones and action potentials were elicited by depolarizing current pulses (10 ms duration, 10 Hz/10 s). In seven neurones vasodilatation was associated with intracellularly evoked action potentials; this vasodilatation was blocked by pirenzepine. Cell bodies of reidentified vasodilator neurones were subsequently shown to contain immunoreactive choline acetyltransferase. 7. These results show that cholinergic neurones in the submucosal plexus project to submucosal arterioles and that they release acetylcholine onto muscarinic receptors to produce vasodilatation. The muscarinic receptor activated by nerve-released acetylcholine is the M3 subtype and its location appears to be on the vascular smooth muscle rather than the endothelium.", 
    "11": "This study examined the effect of food on alprazolam absorption from a mixed polymeric matrix sustained release (SR) tablet in 21 healthy adults. Each subject received each of three treatments according to a crossover design: 1 mg alprazolam SR tablet while fasting; 1 mg alprazolam SR tablet immediately after a standardized breakfast; 1 mg alprazolam conventional tablet while fasting. The breakfast contained approximately 33 g protein, 55 g fat, and 58 g carbohydrate (850 calories). Serial blood samples were obtained and plasma alprazolam levels determined by HPLC. Results indicate that the SR tablet was minimally affected by food. Relative bioavailabilities of the SR tablet while fasting and with food were 100 per cent and 97 per cent, respectively. Although statistically significant, differences in mean Cmax values between SR tablets administered with and without food were small (12 per cent increase with food). Rates of absorption as measured by mean tmax values were also nearly the same: 7.2 h while fasting and 7.0 h with food. Absorption was relatively uniform with the SR tablets. Coefficients of variation for Cmax, tmax, and AUC were somewhat smaller with the SR tablet than with the conventional tablet.", 
    "12": "In 70 children aged between 2 and 14 years the effect of rectal application of ketamine, diazepam and atropine was investigated. Administration was effected by suppositories in 38 children (group A) in four weight classes. Thirty-two children (group B) were premedicated by clysters depending on body weight. We found that the combination of drugs applied in group B showed significantly more effective premedication and enabled smooth induction of anaesthesia. Latency between application and induction was 20 minutes. Since a state of deep sleep can occur rapidly, a preoperative monitoring of the children is necessary. In contrast to group A, we found a smaller increase in heart rate in group B. But there were no differences in behaviour during and after operation between the groups. Despite the relatively small doses of ketamine, 12.8% of all children showed increased salivation. Therefore, this method of premedication should not be used without atropine. Since 11% of the patients vomited postoperatively, the use of dehydrobenzperidol instead of diazepam is discussed.", 
    "13": "Within triads of male Wistar rats, some animals almost completely abstain from competition for palatable sucrose pellets (so-called poor-performing rats), whereas other rats consistently win the competition (so-called high-performing rats). Subchronic (5 mg/kg; 5 consecutive days), but not acute (0.1-20 mg/kg), treatment with chlordiazepoxide temporarily helped poor-performing rats to behave more competitively. This finding, considered together with parallel studies (using high-performing rats), suggested that chlordiazepoxide's beneficial effect was only demonstrable when the poor-performing rats had become tolerant to the drug's initial sedative effect.", 
    "14": "Administration of either the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine or the benzodiazepine diazepam prior to training produced a dose-dependent impairment in the retention of one-trial inhibitory avoidance training in mice. To investigate the nature of this drug effect, the effects of scopolamine and diazepam were subsequently assessed on both acquisition and retention of inhibitory avoidance using a multiple-trial, training-to-criterion procedure. The training was conducted using either continuous trials in which the mouse was free to shuttle back and forth between shock and safe compartments or discrete trials in which the mouse was moved from the shock compartment of the safe compartment at the start of each trial. In either case, training continued until the mouse refrained from crossing into the shock compartment for a specified length of time on a single trial. Scopolamine (1.0 mg/kg) administered before training significantly increased the number of trials required to attain criterion, but did not affect retention when these mice were tested 2, 16, or 28 days later. In contrast, diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the number of trials necessary to reach criterion, but impaired retention of the inhibitory response in mice trained using discrete trials. The differences in the amnestic effects of scopolamine and diazepam revealed by this detailed analysis suggest that diazepam does not impair inhibitory avoidance performance through an effect on cholinergic function.", 
    "15": "The effects of the nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics buspirone and gepirone were compared to diazepam at 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg using the conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm. Buspirone and gepirone produced stronger CTA than diazepam (3 and 10 mg/kg) across repeated conditioning trials, indicating that these nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics may have stronger aversive properties than diazepam. The effects of buspirone and gepirone (1 and 3 mg/kg) were also assessed using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm. Both buspirone (1 and 3 mg/kg) and gepirone (3 mg/kg only) produced CPP, indicating that these drugs may have rewarding properties, and that buspirone is more potent than gepirone in producing CPP. These findings demonstrate that buspirone and gepirone have affective properties similar to abused drugs, and may therefore have abuse potential. It was also demonstrated that buspirone (3 mg/kg), but not gepirone (3 mg/kg), increased dopamine (DA) synthesis in the nucleus accumbens, a mesolimbic brain area thought to be involved in drug reward.", 
    "16": "Previous studies have suggested that elderly men eliminate alprazolam more slowly than young adults. This study in the elderly was designed to determine whether a change in pharmacokinetics influences the response to alprazolam during multiple dose regimens. In addition, the study was designed to determine alprazolam pharmacokinetics and the degree to which its hydroxymetabolites accumulate, the degree of psychomotor impairment, and whether tolerance to impairment and sedation develops during three different multiple dose regimens. Twenty-six subjects completed this study. The subjects were randomized into one of three treatment groups: 0.25 mg q8h, 0.5 mg q8h, and 2 mg q12h. Subjects remained in the clinic for 8 days (day -2-day 5). Day 0 was used as a drug free testing day to establish baseline scores for sedation, digit symbol substitution (DSS), card sorting (CS) tasks, and two computer tests. Subjects received the drug according to schedule on days 1 through 4, with day 5 as the washout day. Blood samples were assayed for alprazolam, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam and 4-hydroxyalprazolam. Alpha-hydroxyalprazolam concentrations were below assay detection limits in all subjects in the 0.25 and 0.5 mg q8h groups and less than or equal to 2.6 ng/ml in the 2 mg q12h group. When detectable, 4-hydroxyalprazolam concentrations were less than 10% of the corresponding alprazolam concentration. Mean alprazolam oral clearance values in the three treatment groups ranged between 0.54 and 0.62 ml/min/kg and half-lives were in excess of 21 h. Degree of sedation and impairment was dose related. Sedation and impairment was not higher on day 4 despite concentrations 2-3 times as great as on day 1, indicating development of tolerance. Subjects were not, however, back to baseline level of performance on day 4.", 
    "17": "A double-blind study of 98 patients who underwent elective hysterectomy or orthopaedic surgery was conducted to evaluate the effect of metoprolol or placebo combined with diazepam given 1-3 hours before surgery. Evaluation was by anaesthetists and by visual analogue scoring by the patients. The anaesthetists found that patients who received metoprolol were significantly less anxious (p less than 0.005) and better sedated (p less than 0.001) before induction of anaesthesia. The patients who received metoprolol found themselves more calm compared with placebo patients. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were reduced by metoprolol compared to placebo. Metoprolol may be a valuable drug for premedication.", 
    "18": "This paper describes a unique program for the systematic screening of commonly used prescription drugs for possible carcinogenic effects, by following up a large cohort of patients with computer-stored pharmacy data for incidence of cancer. Among the most interesting findings in recent analyses are an association of several antibiotics with subsequent lung cancer, and negative associations of prescribed vitamin E and diazepam with certain cancers. Analyses of additional data do not clearly indicate that these represent causal relationships to the drugs themselves. Also of interest is our continuing negative evidence regarding reserpine and metronidazole. The planned computerization of all pharmacies in our medical care program now serving over 2.2 million subscribers, should greatly increase our drug surveillance capabilities.", 
    "19": "Extinction of a food reinforced habit results in an increase in the variability of the response learned in acquisition and in the appearance of previously suppressed competing responses. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of chronically administered diazepam (0.0, 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 mg/kg, IP, -30 min) or 10% ethanol (0.0, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 g/kg, IP, -15 min) on such behavioral variability in the extinction of radial maze performance. Eight groups of food deprived rats (n = 6) were given one of the forementioned doses for 2 sessions of baseline, 18 sessions of acquisition, and 5 sessions of extinction. In acquisition, eight rewards of two food pellets were obtained on each of three trials in each session. The food well at the end of each arm was rebaited when emptied by the animal, consequently an entry into any arm was reinforced. In baseline and extinction no food was available in the maze. Each session consisted of three 10-min trials. In extinction, compared to treatment with vehicle, both diazepam and ethanol treatments decreased the rate of the instrumental response, arm entry, and increased the variability of the instrumental response and of competing responses. Only the effects of the drugs on the competing responses in extinction were greater than those observed in acquisition. It was concluded that the interference-reduction model of drug action best described the magnitude of the drug effects and the variability-reduction model best predicted the direction of the effects.", 
    "20": "The selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (3.0-10 mg/kg), produced a significant dose-related suppression of palatable food consumption in nondeprived rats. The anorectic effect of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) was not reversed by the potent and highly selective cholecystokinin receptor antagonist MK-329 [1-methyl-3-(2-indolyl) amino-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one], administered in doses of 10-100 micrograms/kg. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) also significantly reduced the consumption of powdered laboratory chow in a 6-hr nocturnal free-feeding test. The anorectic effect in this paradigm was also not antagonized by MK-329. In contrast to previous data for d-fenfluramine (which enhances serotonin release), these results indicate that fluoxetine may suppress food intake by a mechanism which is independent of endogenous cholecystokinin.", 
    "21": "Many animal species exhibit approach-avoidance responses upon the novel placement of a mirror into an individual animal's environment. With a view toward identifying new behavioral measures with qualitatively or quantitatively different responses to anxiolytic agents, we developed a mirrored chamber apparatus for which adult male BALB/cByJ mice showed an extended latency to enter. Administration of diazepam significantly reduced this latency to enter a mirrored chamber in a dosage-dependent manner. The psychomotor stimulant, methylphenidate, had no effect on latency to enter the mirrored chamber at a dose which stimulated locomotor activity to the same extent as diazepam. Thus, the decreased latency to enter the mirrored chamber brought about by diazepam seems unlikely to reflect the motor effects of this benzodiazepine. The potency of diazepam was significantly lower in the mirrored chamber assay than it was on three other measures of exploratory activity--\"head-dipping\" performance, plus-maze performance and locomotor activity stimulation. The findings of our study indicate that the mirrored chamber method is simple to carry out, nonpunishing, rapid and quantitative and that it possesses pharmacological attributes which distinguish its response to anxiolytics from other assays of exploratory behavior.", 
    "22": "Effects of caerulein, a cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) receptor agonist, on exploratory activity of mice were investigated. Exploratory and locomotor activity of animals were measured using elevated plus-maze and open field tests. The systemic administration of caerulein at non-sedative doses (100 ng/kg-1 micrograms/kg i.p.) resulted in a significant decrease in the exploratory activity of mice. This effect was completely blocked by proglumide, a CCK-8 receptor. Acute treatment with low doses (0.1-0.75 mg/kg i.p.) of diazepam did not attenuate the anxiogenic-like effect of caerulein, but at more high doses of diazepam the coadministration depressed locomotor activity in mice. After subchronic diazepam treatment (2.5 mg/kg once a day, 10 days, i.p.) tolerance was developed toward the sedative effect of diazepam, and 72 h after withdrawal of the drug the animals showed increased anxiety in the plus-maze test. 30 min after the last injection procedure the anxiogenic-like effect of caerulein (500 ng/kg i.p.) on exploration was absent in both diazepam or vehicle groups. However, 72 h after the last pretreatment injection caerulein (500 ng/kg i.p.) reduced significantly the exploratory activity in control group, whereas it was inactive after diazepam withdrawal. The results obtained in this study support the hypothesis that endogenous CCK-8 an CCK-8 receptors are involved in the neurochemistry of anxiety and the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepine tranquillizers.", 
    "23": "In human atrial and ventricular myocardium, the muscarinic cholinoceptor (M-cholinoceptor) populations were characterized by means of radioligand binding (with [N-methyl-3H]-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) as the ligand) and functional experiments (negative inotropic effect of carbachol on isolated electrically driven right atrial and left papillary muscle preparations). (1) Binding of [3H]-NMS to human atrial and ventricular membranes was rapid, reversible and saturable (KD-values: 0.5-1.0 nmol/l). The maximal number of [3H]-NMS binding sites, however, was approximately 2.5-fold higher in right and left atrial membranes (200-250 fmol [3H]-NMS specifically bound/mg protein) than in right and left ventricular membranes (80-100 fmol/mg protein). (2) M-cholinoceptor antagonists inhibited [3H]-NMS binding to right atrial and left ventricular membranes with steep, monophasic competition curves indicating interaction with a single class of binding sites. In both tissues the order of potency was: atropine greater than AF-DX 116 greater than hexahydrosiladifenidol (HHSiD) greater than pirenzepine. (3) On isolated electrically driven right atrial and left papillary muscle preparations (with force of contraction enhanced by 10(-5) mol/l isoprenaline), carbachol (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/l) caused concentration-dependent decreases in force of contraction; the pD2-value for carbachol was 6.65 +/- 0.09 (n = 8, atria) and 6.62 +/- 0.08 (n = 10, papillary muscles). In both tissues M-cholinoceptor antagonists antagonized the negative inotropic effect of carbachol with an order of potency: atropine greater than AF-DX 116 greater than HHSiD greater than pirenzepine, identical to that obtained in radioligand binding experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "Mice subjected to hypoxic stress resulted in increased respiratory rate, tremor and convulsions followed by death. The latencies for convulsion and death following hypoxic stress were 33.29 +/- 1.20 and 34.36 +/- 1.16 min, respectively. In the present study effects of adenosinergic agents Ro 5-4864, a \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor agonist, and carbamazepine were studied on hypoxic stress-induced neurotoxicity. Adenosinergic agents such as adenosine, 2-chloroadenosine, N6-cyclohexyladenosine and dipyridamole increased the latencies for convulsions and death due to hypoxia. Theophylline (50 mg/kg i.p.), an adenosine receptor antagonist, reversed this protective effect of adenosinergic agents. Pretreatment with Ro 5-4864 (10, 20 mg/kg i.p.) also offered theophylline (50 mg/kg, i.p.)-sensitive protection against hypoxic stress. Similarly, carbamazepine treatment (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly prolonged the latencies for convulsion and death following hypoxic stress. Prior treatment with theophylline (50 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed this protective effect of carbamazepine, indicating the possible involvement of adenosinergic mechanism in the observed protective effect of carbamazepine. These results indicate that the adenosinergic mechanism may be responsible for the observed neuroprotective effect of these agents against hypoxia.", 
    "25": "Alprazolam appears to have an abuse liability among opiate addicts, and detoxification can be prolonged. The authors describe experience with five methadone maintenance patients who were polysubstance abusers and were admitted specifically for detoxification from alprazolam dependence. Phenobarbital in tapering doses adequately suppressed withdrawal symptoms and shortened hospitalization.", 
    "26": "Toxicological analyses on a putrefied cadaver are sometimes difficult to achieve because of the absence of blood and urine. In this study, maggots, living material, are proposed as a new medium of investigation in forensic medicine. Five drugs (triazolam, oxazepam, phenobarbital, alimemazine, and clomipramine) were identified and assayed in some tissues of a putrefied cadaver and in the maggots found on and in the body.", 
    "27": "A randomized study was carried out to determine whether the administration of oxygen (3 liter/min) via nasal prongs significantly affects arterial oxygenation during colonoscopy in patients sedated with intravenous midazolam (2.6 +/- 0.2 mg, means +/- SE) and meperidine (48 +/- 3 mg). Patients who received supplemental oxygen were less likely to become hypoxic (pulse oximeter reading, SpO2 less than 90%) than those who breathed room air (10 of 28 vs. 22 of 28, p less than 0.005). Similarly, the total time during which SpO2 was below 90% was significantly less in patients receiving nasal oxygen (0.7 +/- 0.3 min) than in patients breathing room air (9.7 +/- 1.9 min, p less than 0.001). Minimum oxygen saturations were significantly higher in patients receiving oxygen (90.6 +/- 0.8%) than in patients breathing air (86.5 +/- 0.8%, p less than 0.001). In patients breathing air, there was a significant negative correlation between the dose of meperidine and the minimum observed oxygen saturation; conversely, midazolam dose did not correlate with indices of hypoxemia. The authors conclude that administration of oxygen via nasal prongs can reduce the risk of hypoxemia during colonoscopy. However, since hypoxemia may occur even when nasal oxygen is given, continuous monitoring of arterial oxygenation is recommended.", 
    "28": "Mechanically ventilated children usually require a combination of sedation (morphine = M, diazepam = D) and paralysis (pancuronium = P) to minimize anxiety, discomfort, and the risks of self-extubation, tracheal injury, and pulmonary barotrauma. We sought to determine whether our use of MDP varied with patient age. Cases where the dosage of MDP would be influenced by neurological, hemodynamic, or painful diagnoses were excluded. The 36 cases selected were divided according to age into three groups (less than 4 months = A, 4-18 months = B, greater than 18 months = C). The daily sum of MDP dosages was calculated for each of the 326 study days, a mean of 9 study days for each case. The median daily drug usage in group B (2.3 mg/kg/day) was twice that in either group A (younger) or group C (older) (both p less than 0.001). This finding may be explained by developmental changes in physiology, pharmacology, and behavior, and may have been influenced by a paradoxical drug effect or multiple drug antagonism.", 
    "29": "In a study of 249 opiate (mainly heroin) addicts special attention was paid to adjunctive drug use. Generally, nicotine (cigarette smoking), alcohol and cannabis preceded the use of heroin, and continued to be used as adjunctive drugs after the establishment of heroin addiction. Nicotine was the most common substance used together with opiates. Alcohol and cannabis were used as adjunctive drugs in about two-thirds of the cases. In the late stages of heroin addiction, benzodiazepines were also used concomitantly with opiates. The most frequently reported reason for the use of adjunctive drugs was to intensify the effect of the opiate. Three-quarters or more of the addicts had used different adjunctive drugs to boost the euphoric feeling derived from the primary drug, i.e. heroin. Attempt at self-treatment of withdrawal symptoms was a less frequently reported reason for adjunctive drug use. The findings show that heroin addiction is the major problem. The use of adjunctive drugs, especially benzodiazepines, can be partly explained on economic grounds. They must be clearly distinguished from the primary drug of abuse, heroin. For policy-making decisions, it is important that the elimination of heroin abuse through effective prevention measures would ultimately wipe out the problem of adjunctive drug use, while reduction of the overall supply of heroin without reduction in actual demand might result in an increasing trend to adjunctive drug use.", 
    "30": "Midazolam concentrations in patients' plasma was determined after extraction with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). GC was selected for routine plasma assays in terms of selectivity, simplicity, precision, accuracy and sensitivity (0.02 microgram/mL); HPLC analysis was less sensitive (0.1 microgram/mL) than GC; GC/MS was used for analysis validation. Plasma protein binding of midazolam was determined by GC in patients' plasma after in vitro incubation with midazolam, ultrafiltration and extraction; 5% of the drug was unbound to plasma proteins. Midazolam distribution in lipoprotein fractions separated by ultracentrifugation of plasma obtained from patients on prolonged midazolam treatment was also assayed by GC.", 
    "31": "Intubation conditions and pressor response were assessed in 30 healthy patients undergoing awake nasotracheal intubation. The patients were premedicated with peroral diazepam. All the patients were sedated with intravenous diazepam 0.1 mg/kg. Alfentanil 20 micrograms/kg or saline was administered in a double-blind fashion. Alfentanil caused moderate respiratory depression but significantly improved conditions for fiberoscopy. In the control group, arterial pressures and heart rate increased significantly immediately after tracheal intubation. These responses were attenuated by alfentanil.", 
    "32": "Twenty children undergoing surgery received a caudal block using 1 ml per kg of a mixture of 50% lidocaine (1%) and 50% bupivacaine (0.25%). They were randomly allocated to two groups, one of which received midazolam 0.4 mg/kg rectally as premedication. Midazolam administration resulted in a significantly lower AUC value for lidocaine but did not influence the plasma concentrations of bupivacaine.", 
    "33": "1. Two experiments examined the long-term effects of treatment with buspirone (a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic), diazepam, or Lorazepam (two pharmacokinetically distinct benzodiazepines) on the capacity of a shock cue to disrupt appetitively conditioned behavior. 2. In Experiment 1, rats were injected with diazepam (5 mg/kg), buspirone (1.5 mg/kg or .75 mg/kg), or saline shortly before each of 12 bar press training sessions. Injections were suspended and three days later the rats received five days of Pavlovian fear conditioning (bars removed) in which a tone signaled shock. The capacity of the tone to disrupt bar pressing was then assessed. 3. Bar pressing of rats previously injected with diazepam was more suppressed by the shock cue than that of rats previously injected with buspirone or saline. The long-term effects of buspirone and saline did not differ. 4. In Experiment 2, Lorazepam had effects different from diazepam during bar press training. Nonetheless, rats previously injected with Lorazepam were also more disrupted by a shock cue than were controls. 5. The results suggest that one long-term consequence of treatment with benzodiazepines may be hypersensitivity to behavioral disruption by stimuli that presumably elicit fear or anxiety.", 
    "34": "The chemical compatibilities of intravenous (i.v.) solutions containing ketamine and midazolam were investigated by UV/VIS spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The isotonic solutions used were NaCl 0.9%, fructose 5%, and glucose 5%. The concentrations of additives were 500 mg ketamine and 45 mg midazolam per liter i.v. solution. Comparison of the UV/VIS and IR spectroscopic measurements with spectra from the literature demonstrated, that the substances were pure, e.g. without larger impurities. The HPLC measurements were performed immediately after preparation of the solution and repeated after 6, 25, 50, 75 and 97 h. It was shown that there was no concentration decrease of ketamine and midazolam in the i.v. solutions within an experimental error of 1.5% and within 100 h. Reactions in the i.v. solutions with smaller than 1.5% conversion can not be excluded. We recommend that the prepared i.v. solution be used within 24 h.", 
    "35": "This experiment examined the effects of repeated exposure to diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an organophosphate anticholinesterase, on the retention and reversal of a visual discrimination and on the number of muscarinic receptors in the brain. Rats were trained in a serial reversal procedure. After achieving stable performance, the rats were divided into two groups. One group received repeated injections of DFP, the other group received injections. To determine whether DFP-treated rats would be more sensitive than normal rats to stresses on the cholinergic system, each rat was injected with saline or one of three doses of scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor blocker, prior to testing on every 6th day. DFP alone caused no impairment in performance. Scopolamine produced a greater impairment in DFP-treated rats than in control rats. Similar results were obtained in a second behavioral task, match-to-sample in a water maze, using the same DFP treatment protocol and only one dose of scopolamine. The number of muscarinic receptors and acetylcholinesterase activity levels were reduced on the 2nd and 15th day after the end of DFP treatment. These results demonstrate that although repeated exposure to organophosphate anticholinesterases may not alter discrimination behavior directly, it may compromise the central nervous system so that it cannot react normally when challenged.", 
    "36": "Sodium phenobarbitone (20 and 70 mg/kg) had a significant anticonvulsant action against pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures, which persisted for 21 days of treatment. On drug withdrawal there was a significant decrease in seizure threshold below control level 24-48 h after the last dose of 70 mg/kg. Phenytoin (40 mg/kg) had a significant anticonvulsant action after 7 days of treatment and this persisted for 21 days of treatment. On drug withdrawal there was a significant decrease in seizure threshold 48 h after the last dose. Lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg) had a significant anticonvulsant action, but the group tested after 21 days of treatment did not differ from the controls, indicating that tolerance had developed to this effect; on drug withdrawal there was a decrease in seizure threshold from 24 to 72 h. The only drug to increase aggressive behaviour was sodium phenobarbitone (70 mg/kg); this reached significance after 14 and 21 days of treatment and occurred 8 h after drug administration; 0.5 h after drug administration phenobarbitone (70 mg/kg) abolished aggressive behaviour. After 7 days of treatment phenobarbitone (70 mg/kg) increased social behaviour 0.5 h after administration and this was still increased after 21 days of treatment. On drug withdrawal, there were no changes in aggressive behaviour, but there were significant decreases in social behaviour 24 and 48 h after phenobarbitone (70 mg/kg) withdrawal and 24, 48 and 72 h after lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg) withdrawal.", 
    "37": "The effect of diazepam on spontaneous and tail-pinch-induced behaviour was monitored together with the measurement of extracellular ascorbate using constant potential voltammetry with carbon paste electrodes. Diazepam (3 mg/kg) was followed by eating during the 1st hour after administration in non-food-deprived rats and a reduction in the behaviour triggered by a mild tail-pinch 90 min after drug administration. There was no change in ascorbate concentration in parallel with the spontaneous eating; however, the brisk increase in ascorbate concentration in striatum, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus, which accompanies the tail-pinch, was decreased in size and duration after diazepam. This effect was blocked by the central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro15 1788 (5 mg/kg).", 
    "38": "Normal males participated in sessions providing two operant response options and were administered either diazepam (study I and II) or d-amphetamine (study II). The acute effects of diazepam on human aggressive responding, which ostensibly subtracted points from another person, were determined in study I. Study II was conducted to determine the extent to which social context and response consequence influenced diazepam (study I) and d-amphetamine (previous research) effects on aggressive responding. In study II, the other response option was escape responding which protected the subject's counter from point losses. Aggressive and escape responding were engendered by subtracting points from the subject's counter, and maintained by initiation of intervals free of point loss. Point subtractions were attributed to the other person (study I) or to a machine (study II). Responding to accumulate points exchangeable for money was available in both studies. Acute diazepam administration decreased aggressive responding in most subjects (study I), slightly increased escape responding (study II), and decreased responding to accumulate points. In study II, d-amphetamine increased both escape responding and responding to accumulate points. The effects of d-amphetamine and diazepam were altered by the instructed source of point loss.", 
    "39": "The spontaneous activity of neurons in the pars reticulata of substantia nigra (SNpr) was studied in chloral hydrate anesthetized rats. As a function of dose, intravenous diazepam decreased, and methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCM) increased discharge frequency. Two days after terminating a one week treatment with flurazepam (FZP), both diazepam and beta CCM showed decreased ability to alter SNpr neuronal activity. Neither residual FZP nor down-regulation of benzodiazepine receptors can account for these results. In contrast, behavioral testing revealed no change in the ability of i.v. beta CCM to cause convulsions, suggesting that sites other than the SNpr are of prime importance in expressing the convulsant actions of systemically injected beta CCM.", 
    "40": "The optimal dose and adverse effects of midazolam for premedication were evaluated in 45 patients undergoing local anesthesia. The patients were divided into 3 groups and administered midazolam intramuscularly: group-A 0.075 mg.kg-1, group-B 0.1mg.kg-1, group-C 0.125 mg.kg-1. In this study, concerning sedative and hypnotic effects, the administration of midazolam (0.075-0.1mg.kg-1) showed satisfactory results except in conduction anesthesia of upper extremities (brachial plexus block). However, severe decrease in PaO2 was observed in relatively younger patients. Therefore, it is necessary to observe patients carefully during perioperative period.", 
    "41": "Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were immobilized with one of the following drug combinations: ketamine/xylazine (n = 22), ketamine/promazine (n = 35), ketamine/midazolam (n = 13), or tiletamine/zolazepam (n = 22). Foxes given ketamine/xylazine had the shortest induction and longest recovery times relative to other drug combinations, whereas foxes given ketamine/midazolam had the longest induction times. Recommended doses for the various combinations are given. Foxes given ketamine/xylazine were given either 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg/kg yohimbine, or saline 40 min after anesthetic induction. Administration of yohimbine significantly shortened arousal and recovery times relative to control values (P less than 0.001).", 
    "42": "Seven patients with complex partial or secondarily generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus (SE) refractory to benzodiazepines (BZDs) and phenytoin (PHT) were treated with pentobarbital (PTB) coma with an EEG burst suppression (BSP) pattern. PTB administered by continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion pump at a loading dose of 6-8 mg/kg in 40-60 min was usually sufficient to produce BSP activity and seizure control. PTB was continued 0-24 h at 1-4 mg/kg/h, adjusted to maintain blood pressure (BP) and BSP. Infusion rate was decreased if systolic BP (SBP) was less than 90 mm Hg. Normal saline fluid challenge was occasionally used to elevate BP, but in no case was it necessary to discontinue PTB infusion or use pressors. Other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were maintained at therapeutic levels for chronic seizure protection. Seizures were stopped in all cases. Four patients attained premorbid neurologic status, two patients briefly survived in vegetative states with recurring seizures after PTB withdrawal, and one patient died of asystole after receiving PTB for 7 h. Patients who had poor outcomes had prolonged seizures (16 h to 3 weeks) before institution of PTB anesthesia, and all had significant underlying central nervous system (CNS) pathology. PTB-induced BSP appears to be safe and effective for refractory SE if it is started soon after failure of a BZD and PHT. Ultimate prognosis depends on SE etiology.", 
    "43": "Propofol and midazolam were compared in 40 patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery under spinal anaesthesia. An infusion of either 1% propofol or 0.1% midazolam was given at a rate adjusted to maintain a similar level of sedation. The mean time to reach this required level was similar in both groups. Quality and ease of control of sedation were good in all patients. A mean infusion rate of 3.63 mg kg-1 h-1 was required for propofol and 0.26 mg kg-1 h-1 for midazolam. Immediate recovery, as judged by ability to open eyes and recall date of birth, was significantly more rapid following propofol (P less than 0.001). Similarly, restoration of higher mental function was significantly faster following propofol, measured by choice reaction time and critical flicker fusion threshold. Amnesia for the immediate postoperative period was significantly greater after midazolam (P = 0.0001).", 
    "44": "The induction dose-response of midazolam was compared with the dose-response of its combination with fentanyl and with that of fentanyl alone in three groups of 60 unpremedicated, ASA physical status I or II women undergoing minor gynaecological surgery. The end-point of induction of anaesthesia was inability to open eyes upon command. Dose-response curves were determined for each group with a probit procedure and compared with an isobolographic analysis. Midazolam was found to act in synergism with fentanyl for induction of anaesthesia. Twenty-five percent of the ED50 of fentanyl was required in combination with 23% of the ED50 for midazolam to achieve the ED50 of the combination. This degree of synergism may explain mutual potentiation between opioids and benzodiazepines reported previously.", 
    "45": "This study was designed to determine the specificity and physiological nature of short-term satiety effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) in rats with intact and transected vagal nerves. Rats with-the gastric fistulas, closed or open, were used for normal feeding or sham feeding of liquid meal offered for 30 min. CCK-8 (0.5-10 nmol/kg) injected intraperitoneally (ip) 15 min before feeding inhibited food intake dose dependently in both normal-fed and sham-fed rats at a minimal inhibitory dose of 1 nmol/kg. CCK-8 at the same doses caused a potent stimulation of pancreatic protein secretion, reaching maximum at a dose of approximately 0.5 nmol/kg. Pretreatment with a potent CCK receptor antagonist, L-364,718 (2.5 mg/kg ip), increased food intake during normal feeding (but not sham feeding) and almost completely blocked the satiety and pancreatic stimulatory effects of CCK. When feeding was preceded by intragastric administration of proteinase inhibitor (Foy-305, 200 mg/kg), food preload, or diversion of bile-pancreatic secretion to the exterior, there was a significant increase in the plasma level of CCK and an inhibition of food intake by about 36, 78, and 25%, respectively. Pretreatment with L-364,718 completely abolished this inhibition by Foy-305 and bile-pancreatic diversion and reduced that caused by food preload. Among other gut peptides given ip (10 nmol/kg) only bombesin reduced food intake, whereas gastrin, secretin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and peptide YY (PYY) were ineffective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "This is a case report of severe psychosis and seizures following abrupt discontinuation of alprazolam and then the recurrence of seizures at the end of a gradual tapering schedule. The last of these seizures appeared to be a contributing factor in the patient's death.

    "47": "Symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, including those of irritable bowel syndrome, were reported more frequently by patients with panic disorder than by nonanxious controls. Five of 30 subjects with panic disorder met criteria for irritable bowel syndrome, the onset of which coincided with the onset of panic disorder. Effective treatment for the anxiety disorder was accompanied by a reduction in gastrointestinal symptoms in all subjects.", 
    "48": "Pigeons were trained on a variant of the autoshaping procedure devised by Matthews and Lerer (1987) in which a keylight stimulus ramp of increasing brightness signaled the passing of a 30-s interfood interval. This procedure generates two distinct behavioral components: key pecking and locomotor activity. The effects of three psychoactive drugs on these behavior classes were measured. d-Amphetamine had negligible effects on both types of behavior, whereas diazepam and pentobartital increased key pecking and decreased activity in a dose-dependent fashion. In Experiment 2, the possibility that drug effects were suppressed by excessively strong stimulus control exerted in Experiment 1 was tested by decreasing the discriminability of the stimulus ramp. The direction of the effects of diazepam and pentobarbital was the same as in Experiment 1 but the magnitude of the effects tended to be larger. The effects of d-amphetamine, however, remained quite small, suggesting that, under these conditions, locomotor activity and key pecking are less sensitive to d-amphetamine. In Experiments 3 and 4, key pecking was eliminated by removing the keylight. Reinforcers were presented at fixed intervals in Experiment 3 and at variable intervals in Experiment 4. The drug effects on activity observed in Experiments 1 and 2 disappeared in both Experiments 3 and 4. The results suggest that diazepam and pentobarbital affect activity indirectly by increasing key-pecking behavior, which, in turn, competitively decreases activity.", 
    "49": "1. Effects of three muscarinic antagonists on electrically evoked ACh release and contractile response were investigated in longitudinal muscle strips of guinea-pig ileum suspended in an organ-bath and superfused with Krebs solution. ACh release was determined by a specific radioimmunoassay. 2. Telenzepine, a selective M1 muscarinic antagonist, increased the ACh release at a concentration of 100-fold less than that inhibiting the contractile response (10 vs 1000 nM). 3. AF-DX 116, a cardioselective M2 muscarinic antagonist, inhibited the contractile response at 10 microM, but did not affect the ACh release at this concentration. 4. (-)N-Methylscopolamine (NMS) did not affect the ACh release, but inhibited the contractile response at all concentrations tested (1-1000 nM), indicating (-)NMS can be used as an ileal specific postsynaptic muscarinic antagonist. 5. These data demonstrate that presynaptic muscarinic receptors modulating ACh release are distinct from postsynaptic ones involved in the contractile response and can be classified as M1 subtype.", 
    "50": "1. The oral kinetics of oxazepam after a single 15 mg oral dose was investigated in six healthy volunteers before and during concomitant administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists propranolol (80 mg) and labetalol (200 mg) (racemates). 2. A possible pharmacodynamic interaction between oxazepam and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was examined using a simple reaction time test (SRT) and by measurement of postural sway. 3. The kinetics of oxazepam were not affected significantly by propranolol or labetalol, although oxazepam and labetalol share the glucuronidation pathway. 4. The SRT was increased by combination of both beta-adrenoceptor antagonists with oxazepam, with the greatest increase after the coadministration of oxazepam with propranolol. Administration of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonists alone had no significant effect. 5. Postural sway was affected significantly only by the combination of oxazepam and propranolol.", 
    "51": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDE) reacts in acidic conditions with NaNO2 yielding N-nitrosochlordiazepoxide (NO-CDE), previously shown to exert genotoxic effects in some in vitro systems. The possible intragastric nitrosation of CDE to NO-CDE has been investigated in rats given by gavage high single doses of this benzodiazepine along with NaNO2. Liver DNA fragmentation, as revealed by both DNA alkaline elution and a more sensitive viscometric method, was found to occur consistently and to be essentially independent of the molar ratio drug/nitrite or of gastric pH. The significant increase in the frequency of DNA lesions observed in rats treated for 15 successive days indicates that DNA repair did not keep pace with the accumulation of the damage. Oral administration of single doses of NO-CDE induced similar dose-dependent amounts of DNA fragmentation in liver, gastric mucosa, and brain. Due to the demonstrated absence of carcinogenic activity in rodents, the present results should be interpreted solely as indicating that NO-CDE is intrinsically capable of producing DNA lesions in vivo, an effect by itself not sufficient to induce tumor growth.", 
    "52": "The acute effect of intravenous injections of biperiden and clonazepam was investigated in 14 patients with various forms of dystonia (segmental dystonia, 2; generalized dystonia, 6; and Meige's syndrome, 6). Eleven patients had primary dystonia, and 3 patients had a secondary form of dystonia. Doses of 5 mg of biperiden reduced dystonia when evaluated by total scores, global scores, and subjective scores. Two patients had marked side effects in the form of dizziness. Doses of 1 mg of clonazepam significantly reduced total scores and subjective scores, but the reduction in global score was insignificant. No patient had marked side effects following injection with clonazepam. These results correspond with earlier investigations of the long-term effects of anticholinergics and benzodiazepines. It is concluded that in some cases, intravenous injections can be used as a test for evaluating both effects and side effects of antidystonic medication prior to the institution of oral treatment. Long-term intravenous treatment might be considered in individual cases.",

    "54": "Self-reported feelings of anxiety after separate administrations of ethanol (0.75 mL/kg), low-dose diazepam (0.12 mg/kg), high-dose diazepam (0.20 mg/kg), and placebo were evaluated over four laboratory sessions in the same 90 male volunteers, who used the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Significant increases in the state anxiety scores were observed after administrations of diazepam and ethanol, while a significant decrease in the feelings of tension was reported after administration of placebo. Consistent with previous work from our laboratory, there were similarities in the intensity and time course of change observed for a number of measures following low-dose diazepam and ethanol infusions. The potential importance of these findings to the understanding of intoxication and abuse of benzodiazepines is discussed.", 
    "55": "A prospective study of the necessity of sedation, or analgesia, or both in total colonoscopy was performed. The procedures were performed in the office on 212 consecutive, nonselected patients. Intravenous sedation was not started initially, and all procedures were begun without medication. If the patient developed significant discomfort or sharp pain, intravenous diazepam (Valium, Roche, Nutley, NJ) or midazolam (Versed, Roche, Nutley, NJ) was given. Total colonoscopy was successful in 201 (95 percent) patients. Of these procedures, 173 (82 percent) patients required no analgesia or sedation. In the remaining 39 (18 percent) patients, only small doses of Valium or Versed were necessary. There were 2 (1 percent) complications, but they were directly related to polypectomy (stalk bleeding, serosal burn) and not to the colonoscopy. Patient acceptance was high because most of the patients were able to leave the office immediately after the procedure and many (at least 82 percent) were able to return to work or resume normal activities that same day. Intravenous sedation is routinely used during total colonoscopy by most practitioners and is considered the standard of care in most communities. However, the need for sedation during total colonoscopy has never been proven and is probably not necessary in most cases. Furthermore, when sedation is necessary, most patients are probably over-anesthetized. This is significant, as it may make total colonoscopy more accessible, less expensive, and safer.", 
    "56": "Data were collected on 176 consecutive cases of drug overdose evaluated in an emergency department. Quantitative serum toxic screening (TS) was performed for 164 (93%) of these patients; positive results were noted for 133 patients (81%). Six classes of drugs (ethanol, benzodiazepines, salicylates, acetaminophen, barbiturates, and tricyclic antidepressants) were responsible for nearly 70% of all drug detections and were associated with 80% of all admissions in this patient sample. Only two patients (1%) had drug-specific treatment initiated because of TS results. In 12 patients (7%), TS confirmed substances for which specific treatments had been initiated on clinical grounds. Four patients (2%) had drug-specific treatment discontinued because of TS results. Thirty-two patients (19%) were admitted to a medical service; however, only seven patients (4%) were admitted primarily because of TS results. All other patients were admitted because of clinical abnormalities that required inpatient care. It is concluded that only a few drugs are responsible for most drug overdoses. Moreover, TS results rarely change the treatment or disposition of overdose patients; these decisions are typically based on clinical parameters.", 
    "57": "8319, ((+-)-2-Amino-N-ethyl-alpha-(3-methyl-2-thienyl)benzeneethanamine 2HCl), is a novel compound with the profile of a non-competitive NMDA antagonist. The compound displaced [3H] TCP with high affinity (IC50 = 43 nM), but was inactive at the NMDA, benzodiazepine and GABA sites; in vivo, 8319 showed good efficacy as an anticonvulsant and potential neuroprotective agent. It blocked seizures induced by NMDLA, supramaximal electroshock, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), picrotoxin, and thiosemicarbazide with ED50's of 1-20 mg/kg ip. As a neuroprotective agent, 8319 (30-100 mg/kg sc) prevented the death of dorsal hippocampal pyramidal cells induced by direct injection of 20 nmol NMDA. At 15 mg/kg ip, the compound was also effective against hippocampal neuronal necrosis induced via bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries in gerbils. In summary, 8319 is a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist with good anticonvulsant activity and may possess neuroprotective properties useful in the treatment of brain ischemia.", 
    "58": "Differences in pharmacokinetic data of aminoglycosides, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone between intensive care patients and volunteers or patients who are less severely ill, are described. Similar differences are observed for midazolam. In severely ill patients with normal renal function a wide interpatient variability of aminoglycoside half-life (t1/2) and increased distribution volume (Vd) are observed. This results in inadequate serum levels. A pharmacokinetic approach of drug dosing, based on serum concentrations in individual patients, is advised. For ceftazidime and ceftriaxone similar changes of t1/2 and Vd are observed. Since protein binding is frequently reduced in severely ill patients, the influence of altered binding of highly bound drugs on Vd and drug clearance is discussed. As both may be increased by reduced protein binding, the change of t1/2 to be expected is unpredictable. Dosing regimens should be based on pharmacokinetic data derived from patients whose severity of disease is comparable to that of the patients to be treated.",

    "60": "It has been postulated that many alcoholics use alcohol to \"self-mediate\" symptoms of anxiety or panic. Early diagnosis and treatment in this population are both complicated by symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and controversial because of the belief that alcoholics will abuse anxiolytics. The authors present three patients with alcoholism in whom diagnosis of panic was facilitated by intravenous lactate infusion, and whose symptoms were alleviated by clonazepam. All three patients were able to maintain sobriety during treatment. The authors conclude that in a subpopulation of alcoholics, pharmacotherapy for panic may be indicated and not lead to anxiolytic abuse.", 
    "61": "Cholinergic modification of neuronal responsiveness in auditory cortex includes alteration of spontaneous and tone-evoked neuronal discharge. Previously it was suggested that the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) and muscarinic agonists on neuronal discharge resembled those due to increases in the intensity of acoustic stimuli (Ashe et al. 1989). To determine the relationship between neuronal modifications due to ACh acting at muscarinic receptors and those due to changes in stimulus intensity, we determined acoustic rate-level functions for neurons in the auditory cortex of barbiturate-anesthetized guinea pigs before, during and after administration of ACh. ACh facilitated acoustic rate-level functions in 82% of the cells tested. In addition, during ACh administration 66% of neurons responded to stimuli that were previously subthreshold, that is, ACh decreased the response threshold. Cholinergic facilitation of rate-level functions was attenuated by the general muscarinic antagonist atropine. The nature of the muscarinic receptors involved in the actions of ACh was further examined by presenting single tones before, during, and after administration of ACh and specific muscarinic receptor subtype antagonists, either pirenzepine (M1) or gallamine (M2). ACh-induced facilitation of spontaneous and tone evoked neuronal discharge was antagonized by pirenzepine, but not by gallamine, suggesting the involvement of the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype. These data indicate that ACh can facilitate stimulus-evoked responses and decrease response thresholds for neurons in auditory cortex, possibly via activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. Such effects of ACh acting at muscarinic receptors could underly cholinergic regulation of information processing in the auditory cortex.", 
    "62": "In order to illustrate the use of animal models in the study of the anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of drugs acting on 5-HT receptors, a series of experiments is described. With electrical stimulation of the midbrain central gray (CG), an aversive area of the brain, the 5-HT-1 receptor antagonist propranolol raised the aversive threshold in a dose-dependent way, following its microinjection into the CG. This antiaversive effect of propranolol, which is similar to that of benzodiazepine anxiolytics, was prevented by microinjection into the same brain site of the 5-HT-2 receptor blocker ritanserin. Ritanserin itself and the 5-HT-1A receptor ligand ipsapirone caused either little or no effect. In another animal model of anxiety, the elevated plus-maze, intra-CG propranolol also caused an anxiolytic-like effect, antagonized by ritanserin, indicating a 5-HT mediation. However, systemically injected isamoltane, a congener of propranolol, was ineffective in the elevated plus-maze, whereas ipsapirone caused an anxiolytic effect. Ritanserin was again inactive. Finally, both ipsapirone as well as another 5-HT-1A receptor ligand BAY R 1531, given IP, reversed the learning deficit resulting from exposure to uncontrollable foot-shocks, an effect characteristic of antidepressant drugs.", 
    "63": "Electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic tectum elicits behavioral and autonomic responses similar to those following peripheral noxious stimulation. Benzodiazepine and opioid compounds attenuate escape behavior induced by electrical stimulation of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (PAG) and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC). The present study determines if microinjections of midazolam and morphine applied to these PAG-SC sites affect both responsiveness to peripheral noxious stimulation and to aversive PAG-SC stimulation. Both aversive brain stimulation or foot-shocks applied at threshold intensities caused running or jumps concomitant with increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR). Microinjection of both drugs attenuated the behavioral reaction and increases in MBP and HR induced by mesencephalic tectum stimulation, while attenuating only the increase in heart rate induced by peripheral painful stimulation. These results suggest that the neural substrates of the behavioral and autonomic effects of stimulating the mesencephalic tectum and peripheral nociceptors are different although they may partially overlap.", 
    "64": "The present work reviews neurochemical, physiological and behavioral data recorded from the attacked mouse and integrates them into a model of coping mechanisms during social conflict. More specifically, the possible relationships between systems of pain, memory and defense are presented, with special emphasis on the role of endogenous opioid peptides (EOPs). In recipients of attack, decreased beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity and changes in opiate and benzodiazepine binding characteristics are found in structures of the brain defensive system. EOPs mediate the social conflict-induced increase of dopamine synthesis in the periaqueductal grey and frontal cortex. Social conflict analgesia in attacked mice is under the control of central opioid and nonopioid (e.g., benzodiazepine, glutamate) mechanisms, and is modified by experience (e.g., long-term analgesic reaction; tolerance). EOPs and pain-inhibitory mechanisms participate in the organization of behavioral defense, recuperative behavior and the memory of attack experience. The data are considered in relation to the perceptual-defensive-recuperative model of fear and pain, forwarded by Bolles and Fanselow.",

The average duration of the operative interventions was 25 minutes. After standard premedication--droperiodol, phentanyl, atropine, 30 to 40 minutes before the operation ketamine 0.5--1 mg/kg and diazepam 0.2 mg/kg were administered intravenously and in case of need--maintenance dose from 0.25 to 0.50 mg/kg. Pulse rate, breathing rate and arterial pressure were followed up. Analgesia was evaluated by anesthesiologist, operator and patient. The disadvantages, which have been avoided and the advantages over other types of anesthesia, as well as the final positive assessment, allow recommendation of this form of anesthesia in urologic practice.", 
    "68": "The effect of cimetidine and pirenzepine on the maintenance of healing in duodenal ulceration has been compared in a multi-centre, controlled study. One hundred and sixty-six patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulceration have been randomised to receive either cimetidine 200 mg t.i.d. and 400 mg nocte, or pirenzepine 50 mg b.i.d. for 6 weeks. Patients in each group were well matched for age, sex, weight and cigarette, alcohol and antacid consumption. After 6 weeks significantly more cimetidine-treated patients had healed ulcers: cimetidine showed 8 unhealed out of 79, and pirenzepine 19 out of 74 (p = 0.01). The follow-up phase lasted for 52 weeks or until patient withdrawal or ulcer relapse. During the follow-up phase 77.6% of cimetidine-treated and 68.8% of pirenzepine-treated patients relapsed. This difference in relapse rates is not statistically significant (p = 0.23).", 
    "69": "Experiments on male albino rats were carried out in order to study the effects of diazepam and medazepam on the clonic-tonic convulsions in kindling phenomena evoked by multiple injections of a subconvulsive dose (40 mg/kg) pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). In the two doses used, both diazepam (0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg) and medazepam (2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg) manifest a marked anticonvulsive effect on the clonic-tonic convulsions in PTZ-kindled rats, with a marked dose-effect dependence. The evidence in the literature that the hippocampus plays the role of a pathologically determining structure in the realization of the PTZ kindling and that neurotransmission in the inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus is achieved by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), gives grounds to accept that the anticonvulsive effects of diazepam and medazepam, observed in PTZ kindling, occur through GABA-ergic mechanisms, because the facilitating effect of benzodiazepines on the GABA-ergic neurotransmission is well known.", 
    "70": "High doses of an anticonvulsant agent, flunarizine, given singly or repeatedly produce convulsions in rabbits. Albino rabbits were more vulnerable than mongrel ones. The flunarizine-induced convulsions are interrupted by diazepam.", 
    "71": "An auditory event-related potential paradigm was designed to objectively quantify the effects of drugs on the central nervous system (CNS). A series of tones was presented at three random interstimulus intervals (ISI). The amplitude of N1-P2 and the recovery of this complex across ISI appear to be rapid, reliable and sensitive measures of changes in brain function associated with drug intake. To illustrate, an acute dose of diazepam was administered orally to a small group of normal subjects. The amplitude of N1-P2 was reduced and the slope of recovery flattened, indicating a decrease in CNS excitability concomitantly with the established pharmacokinetics of the drug.", 
    "72": "1. The effect of 7-day treatment with the benzodiazepine tranquilizer medazepam (5 mg/kg), the nootropic agent meclofenoxate (100 mg/kg) and their combination in the same doses on the binding activity of muscarinic receptors in four rat brain structures (cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus) were studied using the antagonist [3H]-1-quinuclidinyl benzylate [( 3H]-QNB) as radio-ligand. 2. Medazepam treatment caused significant decrease of muscarinic receptor binding affinity (Kd) and of the receptor binding capacity (Bmax) in the brain structures studied. The number of muscarinic binding sites was unsignificantly decreased only in the hippocampus. 3. Meclofenoxate treatment caused an increase of muscarinic receptor affinity and a decrease of the binding capacity in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus and an increase of the binding affinity in the striatum and hippocampus. 4. The combination of medazepam and meclofenoxate caused no significant changes of both muscarinic receptor characteristics in the hippocampus and of the receptor affinity in the striatum and hypothalamus in comparison with control rats. The Bmax values were decreased in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hypothalamus when compared with control animals. The differences observed were slighter than those determined after the comparison of medazepam treated rats with control rats. 5. The results obtained afford an opportunity to suggest that the nootropic agent meclofenoxate acts to moderate the effect of the benzodiazepine tranquilizer medazepam on the activity of rat brain muscarinic receptors.", 
    "73": "The effects of steady state dosing with omeprazole and cimetidine on plasma diazepam levels have been studied in 12 healthy males. Single doses of diazepam (0.1 mg.kg-1 i.v.) were administered after one week of treatment with omeprazole 20 mg once daily, cimetidine 400 mg b.d. or placebo, and the treatment was continued for a further 5 days. Blood was collected for 120 h after the dose of diazepam for the measurement of diazepam and its major metabolite desmethyl diazepam. The mean clearance of diazepam was decreased by 27% and 38% and its half-life was increased by 36% and 39% after omeprazole and cimetidine, respectively. Neither drug had any apparent effect on the volume of distribution of diazepam. Desmethyldiazepam appeared more slowly after both omeprazole and cimetidine. It is concluded that the decrease in diazepam clearance was associated with inhibition of hepatic metabolism both by omeprazole and cimetidine. However, since diazepam has a wide therapeutic range, it is unlikely that concomitant treatment with therapeutically recommended doses of either omeprazole or cimetidine will result in a clinically significant interaction with diazepam.", 
    "74": "Effects of alprazolam, alone and in combination with ethanol, on psychomotor and cognitive performance were studied in healthy male volunteers and compared to effects of diazepam. Alprazolam 2 mg produced relatively long-lasting impairments on tests of tracking, verbal and nonverbal information processing, and memory, and decreased blood pressure without a change in heart rate or plasma norepinephrine levels. Although ethanol consumption was demonstrated to produce additive decrements in performance on certain tasks, there was little evidence to support a synergistic effect. Alprazolam 2 mg was accompanied by increased self-reports of side effects, especially drowsiness. Low dose alprazolam, diazepam, and ethanol produced significantly fewer side effects than 2 mg alprazolam, but significantly more than placebo.", 
    "75": "We examined the effects of cholinergic receptor blockers on changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep components. M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor antagonists or atropine were microinfused before an M2 muscarinic receptor agonist, and the effects on individual REM sleep components were assessed. All drugs were microinjected into the same locus within the medial pontine reticular formation in cats, and sleep recordings were made for at least 3 hours postinjection. Results suggest that desynchronized electroencephalogram (EEG) is influenced by the M1 muscarinic receptor, muscle atonia is influenced by the M2 muscarinic receptor, and ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves are affected by the nicotinic receptor.", 
    "76": "Mixed-panic disorder patients (16/60, 27%) randomly assigned to receive blind placebo during a 40-week treatment study were defined as placebo responders based on combined criteria of Hamilton Anxiety Scale score percentage decreases below the median point (-42%), moderate to marked improvement on both clinician and patient Clinical Global Impressions scores, and panic-free at final treatment visit. These criteria applied separately also resulted in a similar clinical grouping and pattern of response. Differential patterns of response between responders and nonresponders occurred across most clinical measures of panic/anxiety. Responders experienced early improvement within the first week of double-blind treatment. This response progressed during treatment and tended to persist during taper and at followup 1 month later. Post-hoc analysis of demographic and clinical features at entrance into the study failed to characterize this stringently defined group of placebo responders.", 
    "77": "Dependence upon a variety of drugs--ergotamine, analgesics, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids--is a major reason for patients to enter an intractable phase of their migrainous disorders. Repeated dosing of dihydroergotamine has proven to be remarkably effective in stabilizing the mechanism of migraine, allowing these patients to make the transition to a more reasonable as well as more specific form of therapy.", 
    "78": "Thirty out-patients suffering from panic disorders associated with agoraphobia were enrolled in a double-blind, controlled trial to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of etizolam and placebo. After a 1-week washout period on placebo, patients were allocated at random to receive twice daily doses of either 0.5 mg etizolam or placebo over a period of 4 weeks. Assessments, made at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment, used the Hamilton Rating Scales for Anxiety and for Depression, the Covi Anxiety Scale, and determination of the weekly panic crises frequency. The results showed that etizolam produced significant improvements in chronic anxiety, phobic ideas, associated depressive symptoms and episodic anxiety, and was significantly more effective than placebo. Etizolam treatment was generally well tolerated and was not significantly different from placebo in this respect.", 
    "79": "This is an attempt to investigate the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a well-known major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, on the blood pressure response in rats and to elucidate the mechanism of its action. GABA injected into a femoral vein of the rat produced a dose-related fall in blood pressure followed by a secondary pressor response. The depressor response evoked by GABA was clearly blocked by pretreatment with chlorisondamine, diazepam and picrotoxin but was unaffected by atropine, prazosin and debrisoquin. GABA-induced pressor responses were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with prazosin or picrotoxin, while not affected by atropine, diazepam, debrisoquin and chlorisondamine. These experimental data suggest that GABA causes biphasically depressor and pressor responses in rats, and that the hypotensive activity evoked by GABA may be exerted through activation of GABAergic receptors and hypertensive activity due to stimulation of the adrenergic alpha-receptors, which appears to be associated with GABAergic receptors.", 
    "80": "The prevention of anesthetic mishaps during endoscopic procedures is of great importance to physicians in training. With the large number of such procedures performed each year, even infrequent adverse anesthetic reactions may result in a significant number of problems. To establish the safety and efficacy of an anesthetic regimen using intravenous meperidine and diazepam, all endoscopic procedures performed at one teaching institution in a 4-month period were retrospectively analyzed with regard to: (1) type and dosage of sedation/anesthesia, (2) endoscopic procedure involved, (3) effect of any underlying disease state, (4) side effects, (5) endoscopic complications, and (6) overall patient acceptance. A total of 716 patients underwent 913 endoscopic procedures with 876 separate anesthetic/intravenous sedations. General anesthesia was utilized in 44% of the 155 pediatric procedures. In the adult patients, intravenous sedation was administered by a physician-in-training under supervision except in 9% of cases (66 patients) when intravenous sedation utilizing alternative agents was given by the anesthesia department. The dose of sedation used (per body weight) declined with increasing age in the pediatric group (0-19 years). The adult dose remained constant for the next eight decades of life (meperidine 0.76 +/- 0.33 mg/kg: diazepam 0.12 +/- 0.08 mg/kg). In the adult group, 758 procedures were performed: 371 patients underwent esophago-gastroduodenoscopy, 258 colonoscopy, 36 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, 40 flexible sigmoidoscopy, and 51 percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Anesthetic-related complications (transient apnea and itching), were noted in two patients, and naloxone was utilized to reverse oversedation in a further 17 (2.56%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "This report delineates the efficacy of local anesthesia in the performance of arthroscopic surgery of the knee. A retrospective review of 500 cases revealed that only three required administration of general anesthesia to successfully complete the procedure. A prospective study comparing fentanyl, midazolam, and fentanyl/midazolam combinations as intravenous supplements was performed. Meticulous surgical technique combined with local anesthesia and some form of intravenous sedation in minimal therapeutic dosage will provide satisfactory conditions to perform surgical arthroscopy of the knee.", 
    "82": "Guanylpirenzepine, a polar, non-quaternary analog of pirenzepine, exhibited a novel binding behavior in rat brain regions: in competition binding experiments against [3H]pirenzepine labeling the M1 receptor in membranes from cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum, the compound, differently from pirenzepine, displayed heterogeneous binding curves. Computer assisted analysis of these curves, evidenced the existence of two populations of binding sites: a large proportion (84-89%) of high affinity receptors (KH = 64-92 nM) and a remainder with very low affinity (KL = 19-28 microM). Like pirenzepine, guanylpirenzepine showed low affinity for the glandular M3 and the cardiac M2 receptors when [3H]N-methylscopolamine was used to label the receptors in membranes from these two tissues; affinity values for guanylpirenzepine were 1336 and 5790 nM respectively, vs 323 and 683 nM for pirenzepine. We conclude that guanylpirenzepine is able to discriminate between m1 and m4 receptor subtypes and may represent a new tool for deeper studies on muscarinic receptors classification.", 
    "83": "The muscarinic receptor in the rabbit pancreas was characterized with the use of the labeled ligand (3H)-(-)-quinuclidinyl-benzylate ((3H)-(-)-QNB). Specific binding of (3H)-(-)-QNB to pancreatic acini was found to be reversible and of high affinity, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 68 pmol/l and a receptor density (RT) of 170 fmol/mg protein. Agonist binding behaviour was investigated by displacement of (3H)-(-)-QNB binding by eight agonists like arecoline, areca\u00efdine-propargylester (APE) and carbachol, yielding only low affinity binding sites. The inhibition of (3H)-(-)-QNB binding by the selective antagonists pirenzepine, hexahydrosiladifenidol (HHSiD) and (11-[2-[diethyl-amino)-methyl)-1-piperidinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyr ido (2,3-b) (1,4) benzodiazepin-6-one) (AF-DX 116) confirmed the M3 nature of the rabbit pancreatic receptor.", 
    "84": "Several substances modulate the function of pancreatic acinar cells in vitro through specific receptors. All of them may also act in vivo, but the relative importance of their effect under physiological conditions is highly variable. The aim of this study was to assess the respective participation of cholinergic nerves and cholecystokinin (CCK) in the interdigestive pancreatic exocrine secretion and in the pancreatic response to intragastric or intraduodenal nutrients. Unanesthetized rats, equipped with a semichronic (5 days) pancreatic fistula, were used. They received a test-meal in the stomach (42 kJ) or the duodenum (21 kJ), and were infused intravenously with an antagonist of muscarinic (atropine, pirenzepin), nicotinic (hexamethonium), or CCK (L364718, lorglumide, Boc-Tyr(SO3)-Nle-Gly-D-Trp-Nle-Asp-NH-CH2-CH2-C6H5) receptors. Basal interdigestive pancreatic exocrine secretion decreased significantly after atropine, pirenzepine or hexamethonium. Protein output decreased more (peak inhibition 60 to 80 percent according to the drugs, p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.001) than volume or bicarbonate output (peak inhibition 25 to 65 percent according to the drugs, p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01). CCK antagonists did not change the interdigestive pancreatic secretion. The cumulated response to the intraduodenal meal did not change after hexamethonium or pirenzepin, but increased after atropine (by approximately 50 percent, p less than 0.001 for volume and bicarbonate output, and nearly 100 percent, p less than 0.05 for protein output). The CCK antagonists entirely suppressed the protein response to the intraduodenal meal, decreased the volume response by 70 percent (p less than 0.01), and the bicarbonate response by 50 percent (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "The GABAergic modulation in the nucleus accumbens septi (NAS) of muscle tone was investigated in rats using behavioral tests. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen dose-dependently decreased muscle tone in the wire-mesh and bar holding tests both after local injection into the NAS (1.0 and 2.5 micrograms), and after intraperitoneal administration in a dose of 20 mg/kg. In the Wirth's test haloperidol (5 mg/kg i.p.), produced catalepsy, whereas baclofen (20 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly deteriorated rats' performance. Intraaccumbens microinjections of muscimol, midazolam, nicardipine, as well as peripheral injections of haloperidol and midazolam failed to modify muscle tone in the wire-mesh test. These findings argue against the involvement of GABAA receptors, benzodiazepine receptors, as well as dopaminergic- and calcium channel-related mechanisms in the effect of baclofen. Hence, the muscle relaxant effect of baclofen seems to be also mediated through GABAB receptor sites within the NAS.", 
    "86": "Self-inflicted acute drug overdose in suicidal elderly patients appears to be a growing challenge to public health. To the best of our knowledge, little has been published on this topic. Thus we undertook a retrospective study, from January 1969 to October 1989, in a medical ICU. Ninety-two suicidal, elderly patients (54 women, 38 men) with a mean age of 77 years were included. The mean length of the hospital stay was 7 days (range: 1-45 days). Seventy-six percent of them were intubated and subjected to mechanical ventilation for a mean duration of 3 days. Overdosing on one drug occurred in 46 cases (50%). Toxicological analyses implicated the following medications: benzodiazepines, 50 cases; meprobamate, 26 cases; barbiturates, 24 cases; tricyclic anti-depressants, 17 cases; trichloroethylene, 1 case; insulin, 1 case. Psychiatric history, recorded for 47 patients, revealed previous suicide attempts by 20 of them. Complications were reported in 40 cases (43.5%): respiratory complications, 25 cases; shock, 13 cases; postanoxic coma, 2 cases. The incidence of mortality (13 cases) was 14%. Thirty-three patients were transferred to psychiatric units after release from ICU. During the same period, our ICU admitted 2,762 patients for acute drug poisoning and observed a 1% mortality rate. Thus, morbidity and mortality are higher in the elderly than in younger patients.", 
    "87": "Midazolam is a water soluble benzodiazepine, with a short elimination half-life in adults and children. An IV bolus of midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 was administered to 10 critically ill neonates receiving intensive care who required sedation. The plasma clearance was 6.85 ml.min-1 and the elimination half-life was 6.52 h. Midazolam was well tolerated during and after administration. Because of its short half-life compared to diazepam, midazolam could be used during the neonatal period to produce brief rapid sedation.", 
    "88": "The stereochemistry of an achiral (Diazepam) and two chiral (3-methyl and 3-succinyloxy substituted) 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones interacting with human serum albumin (HSA) has been investigated by making use of difference absorption (UV) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. Evidence is obtained for a higher affinity with HSA for one of the two possible conformations of the seven-membered benzodiazepine ring. The red shift revealed by the absorption difference spectrum between the free and the bound drug accounts for the CD difference spectra observed."
