    "0": "Oleic acid markedly improved the physical stability of a diazepam submicron emulsion. The zeta potential of the emulsion increased with increased oleic acid concentration. This effect suggested that adjustment of the diazepam submicron emulsion pH to 7.8-8.0 led to the ionization of oleic acid molecules at the oil/water (o/w) interface without being excluded from the surface regions of the oil droplets. TEM freeze-fracturing examination revealed that a mixed-emulsifier monolayer film was established at the o/w interface of the submicron emulsion. No liquid crystal or liposome formation was detected. This was confirmed by the results of phosphatidylethanolamine surface labelling at the o/w interface of the emulsion. The improved stability properties conferred to the emulsion by oleic acid should be attributed not only to the zeta potential increase, but also to the strengthening of the molecular interactions occurring between phospholipid and poloxamer emulsifiers in the presence of an ionized form of oleic acid at the o/w interface of the emulsified oily droplets as evidenced in independent monolayer studies.", 
    "1": "Frail older patients are at risk for adverse consequences from medications or other external stresses. No single marker, such as age or physical disability, or laboratory test can identify this group of patients. As a result, screening questionnaires have been developed and successfully used by nurses to help identify frail older patients upon admission to a hospital. A very short, 7-item screen with questions concerning cognitive ability, physical mobility, nutrition, number of medications used and hospitalisation within the previous month, was able to identify those patients who were more likely to be discharged to a nursing home, die, or incur a large hospitalisation cost for the institution. While the number of medications used was not an independent predictor of the outcome measures studied (e.g. discharge to a nursing home), data from the literature show that the number of medications prescribed is related to iatrogenic complications in older patients, and specific impairments in mobility and cognition. The proper choice and prescribed dose of a medication is extremely important in frail older patients who, for instance, are at increased risk from hip fracture with some benzodiazepines, and who have markedly diminished clearance of some drugs. A systematic approach is suggested for the prescription of medications in frail older persons which will help achieve optimal pharmacotherapy by using a limited number of medications, thoughtfully selecting medications which will not impair function, and prescribing an appropriate dose based on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes that occur with age.", 
    "2": "Peripheral benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors were investigated through the binding of the specific ligand 3H-PK-11195 to platelet membranes, in 17 patients suffering from panic disorder (PD) and in 16 patients affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The results, showing that the density (Bmax) of peripheral BDZ receptors was significantly lower in patients with PD than in controls or OC patients, suggest that the number of platelet BDZ receptors varies with different anxiety disorders and that perhaps this marker may be beneficial in differentiating some subtypes of these disorders.", 
    "3": "The possible involvement of anxiety and learning/memory processes in escape-directed (struggling) behavior in a two-trial swimming test was investigated in mice, as well as the differential effects that low doses of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) could display depending on the animals' anxiety levels. Mice showing less anxiety in the plus-maze test exhibited less struggling behavior in the first swimming trial than the more anxious animals, suggesting a relationship between anxiety and struggling behavior in the swimming test. Flumazenil (5 mg/kg) given before the first swimming trial displayed differential effects depending upon the animals' anxiety levels. Thus, it increased struggling behavior in the first swimming trial in 'low-anxiety' mice whereas the opposite tendency was observed in 'high-anxiety' animals. Struggling decreased in the second swimming trial in all the animals, giving support to the involvement of learning/memory processes in the two-trial swimming test. That reduction in escape-directed behavior was greater in animals treated with flumazenil before the first swimming session, thus indicating a slight enhancement of retention.",

Eight healthy volunteers received placebo, zopiclone (7.5 mg), triazolam (0.25 mg), and nitrazepam (5 mg) in a random-order, double-blind crossover design. Postural sway was assessed before and 1 and 2 h after drug administration using a stabilometer connected to a microcomputer. Triazolam significantly impaired standing steadiness. Zopiclone also impaired standing steadiness but the degree of impairment seemed to be less marked. Nitrazepam 5 mg had no significant effects on postural sway. Triazolam 0.25 mg, zopiclone 7.5 mg, and nitrazepam 5 mg, which are reported to be equipotent to each other as hypnotics, are not equipotent with respect to their effects on postural sway.",

Samples of blood and enzyme-digested liver are extracted without pH adjustment with n-butyl chloride, after addition of deuterated internal standards and urea. The evaporated extracts are reconstituted in acetonitrile for analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/negative ion chemical ionization (GC/MS/NICI). Fatty extracts may be cleaned up by partitioning between pentane and acetonitrile. Two ion pairs are monitored for each drug. Within-day coefficients of variation in the range 10-50 micrograms/L for blood are approximately 5%. Between-day coefficients of variation are less than 10%. The limit of quantitation (based on analysis of 0.2-mL blood samples) is 0.5 microgram/L for triazolam and 4 micrograms/L for alprazolam.", 
    "6": "Experiments were performed to characterize [35S]TBPS binding in rat cortical synaptoneurosomes, which have vesicular structures containing both pre- and postsynaptic elements. Scatchard analysis revealed a single component of [35S]TBPS binding sites with KD and Bmax values of 76.1 nM and 1.97 pmoles/mg protein, respectively, under physiological conditions. GABA and muscimol inhibited [35S]TBPS binding in a concentration-dependent manner. IC50 values of these GABAA agonists in displacing synaptoneurosomal [35S]TBPS binding are comparable to previously reported EC50 values of the agonist-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in synaptoneurosomes by these agents. Furthermore, the IC50 values of these GABAA agonists were better correspondence to those determined by [3H]muscimol binding in synaptoneurosomal preparations as reported by Delorey and Brown (3) than those determined in membrane preparations. Although bicuculline increased [35S]TBPS binding in a concentration dependent manner in cortical membranes, it did not affect synaptoneurosomal [35S]TBPS binding. Benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists (0.1 to 10 microM) did not show any effects on the binding in the absence of muscimol. However, benzodiazepine agonists potentiated and inverse agonists antagonized muscimol-induced inhibition of synaptoneurosomal [35S]TBPS binding. In addition, an anesthetic steroid, THDOC, and pentobarbital inhibited synaptoneurosomal [35S]TBPS binding in a concentration dependent manner. These results suggest that allosteric modulation of [35S]TBPS binding by various ligands which interact with GABAA supramolecular complexes remain intact in synaptoneurosomes. It appears that this preparation is useful for investigating correlation between functional 36Cl- uptake and individual binding studies of each of the GABAA receptor complex.",

These characteristics have suggested its superiority when treating elderly patients or patients with liver disease.

    "12": "We have characterized the presence of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in rat and human prostate. [3H] PK 11195, a putative antagonist, showed a greater affinity for this receptor in rat prostate (KD = 1.71 +/- 0.18 nM) than in human (KD = 15.23 +/- 1.20 nM). In human, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor density (Bmax = 13,575 +/- 1,929 fmols/mg) is double that in rat (Bmax = 6,345 +/- 314 fmols/mg). [3H] Ro 5-4864, an agonist, showed a low affinity (KD = 188.38 +/- 16.46 nM) for human peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor subtype. We did not detect any difference between the population of this receptor in control human prostate and that in hyperplastic specimens. In rat, bound [3H] PK 11195 was partially inhibited by specific ligands of mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier. This characteristic does not occur in human prostate. A common trait of both rat and human prostate peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors is the competitive displacement of bound [3H] PK 11195 by nitrendipine and the blockers of the adenosine uptake system.", 
    "13": "The sulphated octapeptide, cholecystokinin (CCK-8S), is believed to be a neurotransmitter of vagal sensory neurones, and here the presence of functional receptors for CCK-8S in the rat vagus nerve has been investigated by electrophysiological and autoradiographic techniques. CCK-8S caused concentration-dependent depolarizations when superfused over the rat isolated nodose ganglion at 37 degrees C as measured by a silicone grease gap technique. Concentration-response curves to CCK-8S were shifted to the right by low concentrations of the CCKA receptor antagonist, Devazepide, but not by the CCKB receptor antagonist, L-365,260, data which indicate that receptors were of the CCKA subtype. Consistent with this notion, the CCKB agonist, unsulphated CCK-8, was without effect until high concentrations (> 1 microM) were used. A synthetic analogue of CCK-8S, D-Tyr25(Nle28,31)-CCK 25-33S, which has been reported to be more stable and peptidase-resistant than CCK-8S, was equipotent with CCK-8S in depolarizing the nodose ganglion. When D-Tyr25(Nle28,31)-CCK 25-33S was labelled with 125I, it bound to tissue sections of nodose ganglion. By light microscopic autoradiography, silver grains were found to be highly localized over cell bodies of vagal sensory neurones. An excess of CCK-8S inhibited binding as did Devazepide, but not L-365,260, confirming that binding sites were CCKA subtype receptors. These results indicate the existence of functional CCKA receptors in the nodose ganglion and strengthen the case for the involvement of vagal sensory neurones in gastric emptying and satiety.", 
    "14": "1. Anatomical, behavioral, neurochemical and electrophysiological evidence collectively support a role for central 5-HT in the modulation of anxiety and the anti-anxiety action of the benzodiazepines. 2. The advent of selective agonists and antagonists for 5-HT receptor subtypes (5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3) has rekindled investigation of the role of 5-HT in anxiety mechanisms. 3. The azapirones represent a new class of agent which possesses affinity for 5-HT1A receptors (partial agonists) and is active in anxiolytic animal models as well as in the clinic (buspirone) 4. While preclinical data supporting the anxiolytic potential of 5-HT2 antagonists remains controversial, a recent clinical study supports ritanserin's anxiolytic effects. 5. Several animal models support the anxiolytic potential of the 5-HT3 antagonist odansetron (GR38032F). Confirmation of it's therapeutic utility awaits clinical results.", 
    "15": "Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate between the interoceptive stimulus attributes of 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and saline in a two-lever operant task under a fixed-ratio 10 (FR-10) schedule of food reinforcement. Caffeine, buspirone, and Ro 15-1788 failed to engender complete generalization when tested in combination with saline. In drug interaction test sessions caffeine (56 mg/kg) blocked the discriminative stimulus properties of the training dose of CDP and shifted the CDP discriminative dose-response function to the right. This rightward shift in CDP discriminative function was paralleled by a concomitant downward shift in the rate-of-responding dose-response function. Drug interaction test sessions conducted with 3.2 mg/kg of buspirone in combination with various doses of CDP engendered a downward shift in both the discriminative and rate-of-responding dose-response functions. Because 3.2 mg/kg buspirone in combination with the training dose of CDP resulted in complete response rate suppression, additional combination tests were conducted with 3 mg/kg CDP, a dose which reliably engendered > 90% CDP-appropriate responding, and various doses of buspirone. Similar to the CDP-caffeine interactions, buspirone blocked the cueing properties of 3 mg/kg CDP with a parallel reduction in response rates. Interaction test sessions conducted with Ro 15-1788 and CDP resulted in rightward shifts in both the discriminative and rate functions of CDP. We suggest that the interactions between CDP and both caffeine and buspirone resulted from the perceptual masking of the interoceptive (subjective) effects of CDP, whereas the interaction between Ro 15-1788 and CDP reflect pharmacological antagonism.", 
    "16": "The effects of low (2 g/kg) and high (4 g/kg) doses of ethanol and their interaction with the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 (a partial inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor) were studied in two different models of anxiety in rats: the \"elevated plus-maze\" test and the early acquisition of two-way (shuttlebox) avoidance. In the elevated plus-maze, ethanol (2 g/kg) increased the percentage of entries into the open arms (%EOA) and both ethanol doses increased the percentage of time spent into the open arms (%TOA), thus indicating an anxiolytic action which was reversed by Ro 15-4513 (5 mg/kg). By contrast, Ro 15-4513 did not counteract the anxiolytic effect of the low dose of ethanol in the acquisition of shuttlebox avoidance. Thus, the treatment with 2 g/kg of ethanol (plus either vehicle or Ro 15-4513) significantly increased the total number of avoidances. Conversely, animals treated with 4 g/kg of ethanol showed impaired shuttlebox avoidance acquisition, and this effect was completely reversed by Ro 15-4513. Ro 15-4513 was without effect on its own in any of the anxiety-related parameters (i.e., %EOA, %TOA, and avoidance acquisition). The results indicate a different pattern of ethanol effects and Ethanol x Ro 15-4513 interactions depending upon the task used.", 
    "17": "The effects of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, on the development of physical dependence on diazepam were examined in rats using a drug-admixed food method. Rats were treated with diazepam or diazepam in combination with ondansetron for 26 days. After an abrupt withdrawal from diazepam, the incidence of withdrawal signs, such as jerks, tremors and convulsions, and withdrawal scores, were potentiated by co-administration of ondansetron. On the other hand, rats which had been treated with ondansetron alone for 33 days did not show any withdrawal signs after abrupt withdrawal from ondansetron. These findings suggest that ondansetron does not possess physical dependence liability, but does potentiate the development of physical dependence on diazepam. Regulation of serotonergic neurons through 5-HT3 receptors may affect the development of physical dependence on diazepam.",

As to ascites, bed rest, administration of diuretics and albumin infusion improve 88% of the patients. Autoinfusion of filtered and concentrated ascites shows 40% efficacy in patients with ascites, which does not respond to conventional therapy, but is not effective when plasma total bilirubin level is higher than 10 mg/dl. To prevent the development of liver failure in cirrhotic, oral supplementation with branched-chain amino acids is particularly important, in addition to administration of lactulose and prevention of major gastrointestinal bleeding by histamin H2 receptor antagonist and sclerotherapy of esophageal varices.",

Administration of flunitrazepam significantly lowered values for maximal isometric force and for the cardiovascular parameters. It was concluded that triazolam does not influence performance. On the other hand, flunitrazepam does influence a number of strength characteristics and cardiovascular parameters in effort situations.", 
    "20": "We analyzed EEG characteristics comprehensively in a large series of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) cases. Eighty-five ictal episodes in 78 patients were analyzed. The ictal discharges were generalized (group G) in 59 episodes (69%), diffuse with focal predominance (group GF) in 15 (18%), and focal (group F) in 11 (13%). The morphologies and patterns of persistence varied greatly. Frequency of ictal discharge was also variable and was almost always < 3 Hz. Demonstration of focal epileptic features in response to intravenous (i.v.) diazepam (DZP) and the presence of interictal focal epileptiform discharges in some cases in groups G and GF suggested possible focal onset secondarily generalized in these cases. This study suggests that electrographically NCSE is a highly heterogeneous epileptic state, and i.v. DZP may serve as a valuable diagnostic tool in differentiating generalized from focal onset NCSE.", 
    "21": "Valproate (VPA) has been shown to interact with all the major antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) through two mechanisms of action: displacement from albumin binding sites and inhibition of drug metabolism. More recently, evidence showed that VPA inhibits the elimination of drugs metabolized by glucuronide conjugation. Lorazepam (LZP), which is primarily eliminated by conjugation with glucuronic acid, is administered concurrently with VPA both in treatment of epilepsy and in patients treated with VPA for psychiatric disorders. Therefore, a significant drug interaction is likely. We investigated such interaction both in in vitro isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) and in normal subjects. LZP [2 mg, intravenous (i.v.) bolus] was administered to 8 normal volunteers before and after chronic dosing with VPA. In 6 of 8 subjects, VPA significantly decreased LZP plasma clearance by an average of 40% (p < 0.05) and increased LZP concentrations by decreasing formation clearance of the LZP glucuronide. In the IPRL studies, VPA also significantly decreased formation of LZP glucuronide (from 0.72 +/- 0.14 to 0.22 +/- 0.15 ml/h/kg, p < 0.05), indicating that IPRL is a useful tool for evaluation of the effect of VPA on drugs eliminated by glucuronide conjugation.", 
    "22": "The purpose of this report is to describe the use of flumazenil as a diagnostic aid in the differential diagnosis of coma in a patient with an inadvertent overdose of benzodiazepines. We report a patient with suspected septic encephalopathy whose level of consciousness markedly improved following flumazenil administration. Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of benzodiazepines and their metabolites in the blood and urine although the patient had not received benzodiazepines for over two weeks. The critically ill patient with multiorgan failure may have considerable derangement of benzodiazepine metabolism; therefore, if an obtunded patient's level of consciousness improves following flumazenil administration, benzodiazepine intoxication must be considered.", 
    "23": "We have tested the hypothesis that the synergistic interaction which occurs when midazolam and propofol are combined for i.v. sedation is caused by an increase in the free plasma concentration of one of the drugs. Six patients undergoing general anaesthesia received an infusion of propofol with the addition of an infusion of midazolam commenced 30 min later. Another six patients received an infusion of midazolam with the addition of an infusion of propofol 30 min later. All infusions were administered via pharmacokinetic model-controlled syringe pumps programmed to maintain a constant plasma concentration. Venous blood samples were taken before and after introduction of the second infusion for later analysis. Free plasma concentration of midazolam increased from 2.0 (SD 1.5) ng ml-1 to 2.2 (1.9) ng ml-1 after introduction of the propofol infusion (P = 0.32). Free propofol plasma concentration was unchanged at 18.5 (5.3) ng ml-1 before and 18.7 (7.8) ng ml-1 after introduction of the midazolam infusion (P = 0.94). It was concluded that the observed synergism with this combination cannot be explained solely by alteration in free plasma concentration of either of these drugs when they are administered together.", 
    "24": "Administration of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) by the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) route in doses of 2-8 micrograms produced a marked dose-dependent behavioural excitation in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. When LY274614 (1-50 ng i.c.v.) or midazolam maleate (25-50 micrograms i.c.v.) was administered 20 min prior to a maximal excitatory dose of M3G (7 micrograms), all excitatory behaviours were reduced. In contrast, when LY274614 (200 ng i.c.v.) was given after M3G (7 micrograms), it did not reduce all of the excitatory behaviours. Since we have also shown in in vitro binding studies that M3G has very low affinity for the known binding sites on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and the gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABAA) receptor complexes (1), the results of this study suggest that the anti-convulsant compounds, LY274614 and midazolam, are functional antagonists of the excitatory effects of M3G. LY274614 (1-50 ng i.c.v.) and midazolam (25-50 micrograms i.c.v.) did not produce significant behavioural excitation and phenyclidine (PCP)-type effects were not observed. This contrasts with the NMDA receptor antagonists CGS19755 and MK801, where PCP-type effects have been reported to interfere with behavioural assessment. Morphine hydrochloride in a maximal analgesic dose (50 micrograms i.c.v.), did not reduce the excitation score of a maximal excitatory dose of M3G (7 micrograms), lending support to the view that M3G's excitatory effects are elicited through a non-opioid mechanism.", 
    "25": "Pharmacological studies revealed that SR 25776 possesses marked stimulant activity characteristic of a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptor. The effects of SR 25776 500 mg alone and in combination with triazolam 0.25 mg on psychomotor performance and memory were assessed in 8 healthy consenting male volunteers in a double-blind placebo controlled trial. Treatment effects were monitored before and two and half hours following oral medication. The present study suggest that at the studied dose SR 25776 may incompletely antagonize the sedative and amnesic effects of a benzodiazepine agonist without producing marked effects of its own.", 
    "26": "Treatment of the convulsive and neuropathologic actions of organophosphates comprise the major unsolved problem in defending against this class of chemical nerve agents. Understanding and preventing these central actions are important goals of chemical defense research. It is generally accepted that inhibition of acetylcholinesterase results in an accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) which may be responsible for the acute toxic effects of nerve agents. Although atropine has long been used in the treatment of poisoning, it does not significantly reduce convulsions and seizures nor does it drastically alter the acute toxicity. Inasmuch as antimuscarinic agents do not provide sufficient antidotal activity, it follows that ACh may not be the only transmitter involved in the CNS actions of organophosphates. Benzodiazepines, the most potent of the clinically available anticonvulsants are potentially useful as antidote against nerve agent poisoning. However, significant disadvantages are associated with the im administration of benzodiazepines particularly diazepam the now anticonvulsant fielded drug. The present report was undertaken to compare the effectiveness of thienyl phencyclidine (TCP), a non-competitive antagonist at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, to diazepam both administered im for protection against soman toxicity (convulsions, seizures, incidence on death, brain damage). In a first set of experiments, male wistar rats were pretreated with diazepam (1 mg/kg) given im. Fifteen minutes later 1 x LD50 of soman was injected sc and the incidence of seizures and death were recorded for 24 hr. The therapeutic efficacy of a post-poisoning treatment of diazepam was also studied. In this case diazepam was administered 45 min after the onset of seizures. In a second set of experiments, guinea-pigs were pretreated with pyridostigmine (0.2 mg/kg, sc) in combination with atropine (5 mg/kg, im) 30 min before soman (62 micrograms/kg, sc) and the protective effect of TCP (2.5 mg/kg, im) evaluated when the drug was administered either before soman (15 or 30 min) or after the onset of EEG seizures (5, 30 or 60 min). Pretreatment with diazepam alone did reduce soman-induced seizures but did not reduce mortality of rats. Neuropathology was not observed in non-seizuring rats. When given 45 min after the onset of seizures, diazepam failed to protect against status epilepticus and neuropathology. Thus, diazepam was more effective when given before, rather than after, seizure initiation. Systemic injection of TCP blocked the seizures induced by 2 x LD50 of soman in guinea-pigs pretreated by pyridostigmine and atropine. The anticonvulsant potency of TCP was particularly obvious when the compound was administered curatively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "27": "The development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clonazepam (CZP) was investigated using a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindled rat seizure model. PTZ kindled rats received twice daily injections, either 0.3 mg/kg of CZP for 3 weeks, 2.0 mg/kg of CZP for 2 weeks or vehicle (propylene glycol) as maintenance doses. PTZ injections (30 mg/kg) were given once weekly both prior to and after the initiation of maintenance doses. The protective effect of CZP against PTZ-induced seizures was examined by determining the protective effect of a single dose of CZP (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg) given once weekly 30 min prior to 30 mg/kg PTZ injection. CZP treatment continued to protect the rats from kindled seizures during the CZP maintenance period in both experiments. No significant differences were found in seizure responses between rats receiving either dose of CZP maintenance and the vehicle maintenance control group (p > 0.05). We were unable to demonstrate tolerance to the protective effects of CZP against PTZ-induced kindled seizures in this rat seizure model.", 
    "28": "Intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injected 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), which reduced by 70-90% forebrain serotonin levels, significantly raised glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA levels in the hippocampus and nucleus raphe dorsalis 5 days but not 15 days after the lesion. A significant increase of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBR), measured by binding autoradiography of 3H-PK 11195, was found in the nucleus raphe dorsalis 5 and 15 days after the ICV 5,7-DHT and also in the hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, and substantia nigra at 15 days. No significant effect was observed in the striatum and cortex for either GFAP mRNA or MBR binding. Unlike the ICV route, bilateral injection of 5,7-DHT into the medial forebrain bundle, which caused a 65-90% reduction of serotonin levels in different forebrain regions, significantly raised GFAP mRNA and MBR binding only at the site of injection with no effect in hippocampus, striatum, and cortex. MBR binding slightly increased in the nucleus raphe dorsalis 15 days after the lesion. High doses of d-fenfluramine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice daily for 4 days) caused 80-90% reduction of serotonin levels 5 days after the last injection but did not change the GFAP mRNA or the MBR binding in any of the brain regions considered. These findings suggest that the effect of 5,7-DHT on microglial and glial markers is probably related to a nonspecific interaction with other neuronal systems besides the serotonin or to direct interaction with glial cells; the use of these parameters for detecting selective degeneration of serotonin axons presents some obvious limitations.",

Diazepam doses were 0.15 mg.kg-1 and 0.11 mg.kg-1 respectively. The effect and duration of both drugs were similar. The main differences between them were as follows: the intravenous injection of midazolam was not painful (p < 0.01); sedation (p < 0.05), amnesia (p < 0.01) and patient contentedness were most frequent with midazolam.

With continued drug administration, total wake time remained below baseline but not significantly so (125 vs. 145 min). During drug administration, there were no major CNS and behavioral adverse effects reported such as daytime sedation, memory impairment or hyperexcitability (daytime anxiety). Following drug withdrawal, there was no significant increase in wakefulness, i.e., no rebound insomnia (150 vs. 145 min). In summary, temazepam, 7.5 mg is effective in elderly subjects with short-term use and has a minimum of adverse effects. Use of hypnotic drugs is an adjunctive therapy which should be for a short-term period with subsequent short-term intermittent use as needed. Because of its low propensity for producing rebound insomnia, temazepam can be effectively used in this manner.", 
    "35": "Two patients gazed at the bright light of a video camera. Both patients had been taking triazolam. Decreased visual acuity and macular lesions were found in the affected eyes of the patients. The maculopathy in 1 patient (case 1) was irreversible, but that in case 2 recovered. Photic maculopathy from the light of a video camera may be rare.", 
    "36": "Six FDA approved, injectable compounds [benztropine (BZT); biperiden (BIP); dicyclomine (DCL); l-hyoscyamine (HYO); orphenadrine (ORP); scopolamine (SCP)] were each compared to diazepam (DZ, the standard) in male guinea pigs against ongoing soman-induced convulsive or sub-CV (CV/sub-CV) activity. Three trained graders concurrently assigned CV/sub-CV scores to each animal based on signs of intoxication at various times post-soman. Animals received (im) pyridostigmine (26 micrograms/kg) 30 min before soman (56 micrograms/kg; 2 x LD50), atropine (2 mg/kg) admixed with 2-PAM (25 mg/kg) at one min after soman, and the candidate drug preparation at 5.67 min post soman, a time when CV activity was assured. BIP and SCP were effective over dosage ranges between 10 and 0.3, and 1.0 and 0.13 mg/kg, respectively, while the other preparations were less effective at their respective maximum dosages. At the most effective dosages of SCP (1.0 mg/kg) and BIP (10 mg/kg), the CV/sub-CV scores were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of DZ. Only 33% survival was observed at each of two doses of ORP and one dose of HYO; therefore, no further testing was done with these compounds. Using freshly prepared solutions, DCL (up to 40 mg/kg) and BZT (up to 96 mg/kg) were tested with mixed results; DCL lowered lethality while BZT increased lethality. CV/sub-CV scores for the most effective dose of DCL and BZT were, however, lower than those of DZ. SCP is an antimuscarinic drug devoid of antinicotinic activity, while BIP possesses antimuscarinic, antinicotinic, antispasmodic and anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate activity. Recent evidence suggests that, in late stages of intoxication by nerve agents, noncholinergic, excitatory amino acid receptors may become involved and necessitate the use of a multi-action drug like BIP. The findings herein suggest that SCP and BIP are superior to DZ, but further studies are needed to determine which drug or drug class should be pursued in more advanced testing.", 
    "37": "A case is presented in which intravenous midazolam was titrated to sedate a patient with a spastic nerve/muscle disorder during a post and crown preparation procedure. The patient, a 29-year-old woman with uncontrolled limb and body movements, was given midazolam in small incremental doses, not exceeding 0.5mg, at approximate intervals of 10 minutes after receiving a bolus dose of 0.75mg at the start of the procedure. The 0.5mg doses were given every time limb/body movements increased. The total dose of 0.1mg/kg, often given as a bolus for sedation in dentistry, was not exceeded during the procedure. No adverse effects were observed and the patient remained well sedated and cooperative during the entire procedure which was completed to the full satisfaction of all involved.", 
    "38": "SPECT studies for rCBF imaging in clinical epilepsy are reviewed divided into interictal, ictal and postictal SPECT studies in partial and generalized epilepsies, as compared with the corresponding PET studies, and at times referring to SPECT studies in experimental models of epilepsy. All of the interictal, ictal and postictal SPECT scans in partial epilepsy are useful for the regional determination of epileptic foci, in view of the high appearance rates of focal abnormalities on these SPECT scans and good correlation with epileptic EEG foci. Mechanisms underlying the focal abnormality on interictal SPECT scans (i.e., focal hypoperfusion) image are complicative, and therefore, studies concerning the underlying mechanisms are reviewed with regard to correlations of the SPECT abnormality with the following various clinical factors: focal organic lesions on X-ray CT or MRI scans, frequencies of clinical seizures or interictal seizure discharges on EEGs, background EEG activity, propagation of epileptic activity, antiepileptic drugs, and cognitive functions. Further, new neurochemical SPECT studies using 123I-Iomazenil for benzodiazepine receptor imaging in clinical epilepsy are reviewed and compared with earlier SPECT studies for rCBF imaging with regard to their utility in regional determination of epileptic foci. In addition, the few SPECT or PET studies available on epileptic psychosis are reviewed.", 
    "39": "The effects of low oral doses of lorazepam on several cognitive and performance tasks were investigated in 50 healthy students. A double-blind, parallel group design was used to compare five treatments: placebo and lorazepam 0.5, 0.75, 1 mg and progressive doses up to 1.5 mg. After randomization, all subjects received placebo for 3 days in a single-blind procedure followed by five consecutive days of treatment. Subjects completed a battery of tests each day of the 5 days active treatment and the day after stopping the treatment. There were no significant differences between placebo and lorazepam on the free recall test and the critical flicker fusion frequency test, but lorazepam produced significant improvement on the digit symbol substitution test and the choice reaction time test. We suggest that low repeated doses of lorazepam in healthy subjects improve the psychomotor performance without sedation and memory impairment.", 
    "40": "Unbound plasma concentrations of diazepam and flunitrazepam were related to psychomotor and subjective effects of the two drugs. The interindividual variability in plasma protein binding of both diazepam (98.5 +/- 0.14%) and flunitrazepam (84.5 +/- 1.2%) was relatively small, and high correlations were therefore observed between the individual unbound and total drug plasma concentrations after a particular dose. However, poor correlations were seen between individual unbound drug plasma concentrations and psychomotor or subjective effects. This observation indicates that factors other than individual variability in drug plasma concentration, account for the pronounced individual differences in, for example, psychomotor impairment frequently observed after intake of benzodiazepines. Furthermore, based on a linear relationship between unbound drug plasma concentrations and increase in either complex choice or simple reaction time, the potency of flunitrazepam was calculated to be about seven times higher than the potency of diazepam. This is approximately two times higher than expected from the reported in vitro affinity of the two drugs for the benzodiazepine receptor. This finding may indicate that flunitrazepam may have a higher apparent in vivo intrinsic efficacy than diazepam when assessed by psychomotor impairment.", 
    "41": "The action of ethosuximide, valproate and clonazepam against pentylenetetrazol-induced epileptic EEG phenomena was studied in acute experiments in rats with intercollicular brainstem transection. Ethosuximide lost its action against both rhythmic metrazol activity (model of human absences) and EEG seizures. On the contrary, the action of valproate and clonazepam in cerveau isol\u00e9 rats was the same as in intact animals. The site of anticonvulsant action of ethosuximide may be localized in hindbrain structures, whereas the actions of both valproate and clonazepam may be demonstrated even if hindbrain structures had been eliminated.", 
    "42": "A double-blind study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of an oral dose of midazolam 7.5 mg as compared to placebo in a sample of 32 children who had refused dental care after the conventional psychological approach alone was used to reduce fear and apprehensive behavior. Parameters assessed before and 30 minutes after the oral administration of either midazolam or placebo were mental attitude, hypnotic activity, motor activity, quality of sedation and of dental treatment. A three-point scale was designed in each studied parameter and mean values +/- s.e.m. were compared before and after treatment by using Wilcoxon's rank test. It was shown that an oral dose of midazolam 7.5 mg significantly improved all parameters under evaluation (p < 0.01) as compared to placebo, effects which appeared thirty minutes after administration. It is concluded that oral midazolam provides a fast and adequate sedation in children refusing dental care. Thus, the drug is an alternative to other sedative or hypnotic drugs currently used in the premedication of the apprehensive child.", 
    "43": "The presence of psychotropic drugs was determined in 383 blood samples of drivers being responsible for car accidents, having taken alcohol as well. Benzodiazepines were detected in 52 cases and cannabinoids in 31 cases. The characterisation of these positive cases showed a majority of classic benzodiazepines (diazepam, nordiazepam, and bromazepam). Even if the specific role of these two families of psychotropic drugs cannot be deduced from this study, the results should make drivers more aware of the dangers of the simultaneous consumption of alcohol and psychotropes.", 
    "44": "By means of radioligand binding assay, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in the telencephalon, diencephalon, brain stem and cerebellum, were investigated in a rat model with hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Binding to PBR was studied using [3H]PK11195 as radioligand. It was demonstrated that only densities (Bmax) of [3H]PK11195 binding to crude synaptosomal membranes in the telencephalon, diencephalon of HE rats were obviously increased as compared with those of controls (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively). Increased affinities (Kd) were only observed in brain stem (P < 0.05). The results showed that the alterations of PBR in different regions of the brain play a significant role in the pathogenesis of HE.", 
    "45": "Binding of a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand was used to quantify the reactive gliosis resulting from neuronal damage induced by systemic injections of kainic acid 7 days previously. The enhancement of binding in rat hippocampus could be prevented by injections of the purine analogue (R)-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine at 25 microgram/kg up to 2 h before or after the toxin. These results indicate that the purine is able to prevent neurotoxicity by interrupting events occurring some time after kainate administration.", 
    "46": "Clobazam (CLB), a 1,5-benzodiazepine, is a remarkably effective add-on drug for individual patients with refractory partial epilepsy. CLB has an excellent safety record. As with all benzodiazepines used for treating epilepsy, sedation and withdrawal effects, together with the development of tolerance, limit its usefulness. Recent efforts to prevent or reverse tolerance with intermittent administration of CLB or periodic injection of a benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, are encouraging and justify further investigations.", 
    "47": "The literature was reviewed to define the role of clobazam (CLB) in the treatment of epilepsy. CLB is an effective antiepileptic drug (AED) in most varieties of seizures and epilepsies for both short-term and long-term treatment. Tolerability of CLB is satisfactory, better than for conventional benzodiazepines. CLB has no significant interaction with other drugs. Tolerance may develop, but this aspect may have been overemphasized: a long-term benefit figure of 28% can be expected without tolerance. When CLB maintains efficacy, patients continue to benefit for years without drug dependence or unwanted side effects. CLB appears to be a useful treatment for epilepsy as intermittent or short-term add-on therapy; but it should also be tried as long-term therapy in some situations, especially as add-on therapy for patients with refractory epilepsy, as add-on or monotherapy for patients with anxiety, or in some women in association with oral contraceptives.", 
    "48": "Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent seizures. Many epilepsies with focal seizures as well as convulsive generalized seizures respond satisfactorily to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that reduce repetitive firing (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate) or that augment GABAA-mediated inhibition (e.g., phenobarbital and benzodiazepines). A number of drugs presently under development, such as NMDA receptor antagonists, loreclezole, losigamone, methysticine, and dextromethorphan, are promising in acute animal models of otherwise drug-resistant convulsant activity. As a result of recent studies in both experimental models and surgically resected human epileptic brain, the prospects for development of AEDs have significantly improved. Several new AEDs recently have reached the commercial market or are in experimental or clinical trials. A comparative presentation of the standing of the new AEDs with respect to their efficacy and side effects is necessary, but still very difficult. Because initial experience with new AEDs is restricted to populations with severe drug-resistant epilepsy, the crucial question whether potential new AEDs can alter prognosis is not yet definitively answered. There is a clear need to compare the effects of standard AEDs and new AEDs in naive patients and over longer follow-up periods. Moreover, because of the strong desire to develop antiepileptic therapy that directly treats the primary etiology of a given epileptic syndrome, or modifies the neurobiological processes that cause recurrent seizures, better experimental epilepsy models for chronic epilepsy and further clinical studies are necessary to increase the knowledge on the pathophysiology of distinct epileptic syndromes. In this respect, studies on the differences between responders and nonresponders to a given AED treatment are extremely valuable.", 
    "49": "Drugs have been in the past and will in the future still be liable to induce apnea in neonates, infants and older children. At these different stages of development, the child may be abnormally vulnerable to respiratory disorders and apnea, and doses of drugs, without any abnormal side effects in adult patients, can be harmful in younger subjects. Drugs responsible for apnea during development are numerous, but more than half of the problems are induced by sedatives and hypnotics, among which phenothiazines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines (included transplacentally acquired) and general anesthetics are a few. Other pharmacological families are apnea inducers in the neonatal period and childhood: analgesics and opioid narcotics, agents acting at the levels of neuromuscular function and autonomic ganglia, and cardiovascular agents. The pathogenesis of these apneas depends on the disturbance of any mechanism responsible for the respiratory activity: medullary centers and brain stem structures, afferent influx to CNS, sleep stages, upper airways, lungs and respiratory muscles. At key stages such as birth and infancy, drugs may emphasize the particular sensitivity of the mechanisms responsible for inducing apnea. This might explain unexpected respiratory disorders during development.", 
    "50": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and the radioligand [11C]flumazenil were used to examine benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor binding in the human brain. In a first study of healthy males acute ingestion of alcohol did not alter total radioactivity uptake or specific [11C]flumazenil binding in the neocortex or cerebellum. In a second study [11C]flumazenil binding was determined in 5 healthy male controls and 5 chronic alcohol dependent men using a saturation procedure with two PET experiments. Mean values for BZ-receptor density and affinity were similar in the two groups but the Bmax variance for the alcohol dependents was significantly larger (p < 0.05) for all regions. The present studies do not support the view that alcohol affects central BZ receptor binding in man.", 
    "51": "1. Total saponin fraction decreased the affinity of specific [3H]muscimol binding without changes in Bmax. Ginsenoside Rb1 Rb2, Rc, Re, Rf and Rg1 inhibited the specific [3H]muscimol binding to the high-affinity site. 2. Total saponin fraction increased the affinity of specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Ginsenoside Re and Rf enhanced specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding. 3. Total saponin fraction decreased the affinity of specific [35S]TBPS binding without changes in Bmax. Ginsenosides did not affect specific or non-specific [35S]TBPS binding. 4. Total saponin fraction decreased the affinity of specific [3H]baclofen binding without changes in Bmax. Ginsenoside Rc inhibited specific [3H]baclofen binding.", 
    "52": "1. The effects of several drugs on the habituation of exploratory activity in mice were investigated by using animal movement analyzing systems which could detect horizontal and vertical activities. 2. Habituation was regarded as the difference between exploratory activity measured first (session 1) and that measured second (session 2). 3. Scopolamine (1, 3 and/or 6 mg/kg), pirenzepine (20 and 40 micrograms) injected immediately after session 1, cycloheximide (30 mg/kg), diazepam (1, 2 and/or 4 mg/kg) and dizocilpine (0.05, 0.1 and/or 0.2 mg/kg), unlike butylscopolamine (1, 3 and 6 mg/kg) or haloperidol (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg), significantly increased horizontal activity but not always vertical activity in session 2. 4. From the results obtained, it appears that the increase in horizontal activity in session 2 is more appropriate as an indicator of the impairments of memory processes than that in vertical activity.", 
    "53": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) has been implicated as a modulator of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission in the mesolimbic DA pathway, a primary pathway implicated in the effects of cocaine related to its abuse. The present experiment was designed to examine whether an antagonist that acts at either CCKA or CCKB receptors can modify the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine in animals. Rats (N = 9) and rhesus monkeys (N = 3) were trained in two-lever drug discrimination paradigms to discriminate cocaine from saline. Lever pressing was maintained by food (all rats, two monkeys) or shock avoidance (one monkey). In rats, the CCKA antagonist MK-329 (1.0-32 mg/kg, i.p.) or the CCKB antagonist CI-988 (1.0-32 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered 30 min before determination of cocaine dose-response functions using a cumulative dosing method. In monkeys, CI-988 (8.0-32 mg/kg, i.m.) was administered 30, 60 or 120 min before the training dose of cocaine. In both species, cocaine produced dose-related increases in the percentage of responses emitted on the cocaine-appropriate lever. In rats, MK-329 shifted the cocaine dose-response function to the right in a dose-related manner. In contrast, CI-988 did not systematically alter the effects of cocaine in either rats or monkeys. Since drug discrimination serves as an animal model of the subjective effects of drugs in humans, these results suggest that CCKA antagonists may decrease the subjective effects of cocaine. It seems unlikely that CCKB antagonists will alter the subjective effects of cocaine.", 
    "54": "Enantiomers of 3-O-methyloxazepam (MeOX) and 3-O-ethyloxazepam (EtOX) were resolved by chiral stationary phase high-performance liquid chromatography (CSP-HPLC). Reaction kinetics and deuterium isotope effects of acid-catalyzed racemization of enantiomeric MeOX in ethanol and enantiomeric EtOX in methanol were studied by spectropolarimetry. The acid-catalyzed heteronucleophilic substitution reactions of racemic MeOX in ethanol and racemic EtOX in methanol were studied by reversed-phase HPLC. Thermodynamic parameters involved in the reactions were obtained by temperature-dependent reaction rates. The effects of solvent's dielectric constant on the heteronucleophilic substitution reactions were also determined. A nucleophilically solvated and transient C3 carbocation intermediate resulting from an N4-protonated enantiomer, derived from a 1,4-benzodiazepine either in M (minus) or P (plus) conformation, is proposed to be an intermediate and responsible for the acid-catalyzed stereoselective nucleophilic substitution and the resulting racemization.", 
    "55": "The in vitro effect of diazepam on natural killer (NK) cell activity isolated from human peripheral blood has been investigated. NK cell function was estimated by means of a radioactive chromium (51Cr) assay in which human erythroleukaemia K562 cells were used as the target. Diazepam suppressed NK cell function in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-7)-10(-5) M) and a positive correlation was found between the dose of diazepam and inhibition detected by percentage killing of K562 cells. These data indicate that diazepam influences cytotoxic activity and diminishes anti-viral and anti-tumour defence reactions in humans.", 
    "56": "The bioequivalence of three different commercial diazepam tablets (5 mg) using the innovator product (Valium, Roche) as a reference was evaluated in eight psychiatric patients, following a multiple-dose regimen (5 mg t.i.d.). Each patient received the four treatments sequentially according to a Latin square design, with balance for first residual effect. Blood samples were taken once the steady state of the drug had been reached, and the plasma levels were determined using a HPLC method. No statistical differences were found in diazepam steady-state levels after the administration of the four formulations, indicating that they could be considered equivalent.", 
    "57": "A 15-year-old girl was admitted to ICU in a comatose state. She presented with mydriasis, areflexia, hypoxemia and seizures. She was immediately intubated and connected to a ventilator. The seizures were reversed with intravenous diazepam. CT scan was negative. EEG showed a diffuse fast activity and theta waves with spikes in the anterior and temporal regions, bilaterally. The gastric lavage was suggestive of drug ingestion. The patient completely recovered after 6 h of mechanical ventilation and supportive management. Mydriasis was still present after the resolution of neurological symptoms. The girl told us she had ingested 10 tablets (3 g-55 mg/kg) of Loftyl (buflomedil) for suicidal intention. The buflomedil concentrations at 2-3 h from ingestion were 24.8 mg/l in the blood, 324.4 mg/l in the urine and 6.9 mg/l in the gastric content. The p-desmethyl metabolite was also identified in the urine. Buflomedil is a rheological agent largely used as a vasodilator in some European countries. Some recent reports have emphasized the risk of acute intoxication with this drug. Relatively low doses (50-60 mg/kg) have been associated with an important neurological toxicity and a high mortality. We suggest that the clinical picture we observed might be related to a neuroleptic-type action of buflomedil. We bring to attention the risk of a large, uncontrolled diffusion of a drug capable to cause serious consequences at relatively low doses.",

Gun-shot peritonitis is characterized by initial multiorgan insufficiency and instability of central hemodynamic index. We used planned neuroplegia and sedatives of benzodiazepine type in severe craniocerebral trauma. In fat embolism of cerebral vessels we used lipostabil and heparin. There were also cases of heart wounds and injuries.", 
    "59": "Psychotropic medication is used extensively in the borderline patient in an effort to treat the cognitive, affective, impulsive-behavioral and anxious-fearful symptoms which comprise the state symptoms and trait vulnerabilities of BPD. This paper reviews the efficacy of neuroleptics, antidepressants (TCA, MAOI and SSRI), lithium carbonate, carbamazepine and benzodiazepines against these 4 symptom domains. There is currently no single drug treatment of choice in BPD. Current research supports acute treatment. Maintenance trials are generally lacking or show limited efficacy. A dimensional approach is recommended for clinical practice and future research trials, targeting specific symptom domains with selective medication. Pharmacotherapy should be viewed as a useful adjunct to psychotherapy in the long-term treatment of the borderline patient.", 
    "60": "90 patients with alcoholism stage II suffering from secondary affective disorders (anxiety, depression) were divided into 4 groups: treated with GABA-B-receptor ligand baclofen (group 1), with sibazon (group 2), amitriptylin (group 3), placebo (group 4). As shown by clinical, experimental psychological and electrophysiological examinations, baclofen is not inferior in efficacy to sibazon and amitriptylin, but is free of side effects and complications typical for the above drugs (central deprivation, addiction, etc.). MAO activity was unaffected in all the patients, so were dopamine, serotonin and GABA blood concentrations after the treatment. This does not allow to relate the peripheral metabolism of GABA and monoamines to emergence of secondary affective disorders in alcoholism. The authors think promising to seek for drugs effective against affective disorders among ligands of GABA-B receptors.", 
    "61": "We have assessed the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between fluvoxamine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and alprazolam, a triazolobenzo-diazepine. Healthy men took fluvoxamine maleate daily for 10 days (50 mg on days 1-3, 100 mg on days 4-10) (n = 20), 1 mg of alprazolam four times daily for four days (days 7-10 of the study period) (n = 20), or a combination of the two (n = 20), according to a parallel study design. Alprazolam and fluvoxamine concentrations were measured in serial plasma samples by HPLC and gas chromatography respectively, and psychomotor performance and memory were assessed on days 1, 7, and 10. Fluvoxamine increased plasma alprazolam concentrations by 100%. The mean apparent half-life of alprazolam was increased from 20 h to 34 h after fluvoxamine co-administration. The increased plasma concentrations of alprazolam resulted in significantly greater reductions in psychomotor performance evident on day 10. Mean fluvoxamine plasma concentrations were about 25% lower in those who took the combination than in those who took only fluvoxamine; this was more likely due to heterogeneity between the treatment groups than to an effect of alprazolam. The dosage of alprazolam should be reduced during co-administration with fluvoxamine.", 
    "62": "The central effects of atenolol (50 mg tds) and captopril (50 mg tds) ingested for a period of seven days were studied in ten healthy volunteers. A placebo and two active control drugs, methyldopa (250 mg tds) and oxazepam (10 mg), were included in the design. Oxazepam was ingested on the seventh day only, with a placebo being taken on the preceding six days. On the seventh day, central effects of the drugs were tested at 10.00-11.00 h (session 1), immediately before the subjects' last dose of each drug and at 2.5-3.5 h after the final dose of each drug (1330-1430 h, session 2). Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. Recordings of the EEG and body sway were carried out. Neither atenolol nor captopril altered performance at any of the skills tested. There were no effects on subjectively assessed alertness or mood with captopril, while atenolol significantly increased wakefulness in session 2 and when the two sessions were meaned. Similarly, captopril did not modify body sway, while with atenolol there was a significant decrease in activity in the frequency range 1.0-2.75 Hz from session 1 to session 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "63": "The endpoints assessed by both patients and nurses were compared in three anti-emetic studies. In a parallel subjects study, there was no significant difference between the patients' and nurses' assessment of the number of vomiting episodes, but the duration of vomiting, the severity and duration of nausea, and the side-effects of the anti-emetic were given higher scores by the nurses. In two cross-over studies, the patients recorded more vomiting episodes than the nurses, while the nurses recorded more anxiety and sedation than the patients. This resulted in the patients detecting a difference between the side-effects of the anti-emetics being compared that was not apparent from the nurses' forms. Many of the differences reflect differences in the timing and frequency of data collection. Nurses collected data regularly during the assessment period whereas patients reported their experiences only at the completion of 24 h. Both assessments provide useful perspectives on the study outcomes.", 
    "64": "The muscarinic class of acetylcholine receptors is widely distributed throughout the body and mediates numerous vital functions in both the brain and autonomic nervous system. Within the brain, muscarinic receptors play an important role in learning, memory and the control of posture. There is a decrease in the synthesizing enzyme for acetylcholine in Alzheimer's disease, and damage to the ascending cholinergic system is thought to be an important determinant of the loss of memory and other functional deficits of this disease. Five subtypes of the muscarinic receptor (m1-m5) have been identified, and these receptors have a differential distribution throughout the body. The differential distribution of subtypes of the muscarinic receptor in the body suggests that centrally acting m1 and m4 muscarinic agonists might be efficacious in the treatment of age-related memory disorders, without causing peripheral side effects. In addition to the primary ligand binding site, muscarinic receptors also possess a secondary allosteric site that appears to be the target for some novel cardioselective muscarinic antagonists including the neuromuscular blocking agent gallamine. The existence of a secondary allosteric site on the muscarinic receptor suggests that it might be possible to develop novel allosteric muscarinic agonists that potentiate the effects of endogenous acetylcholine much in the same way that benzodiazepines potentiate GABA. Although no such allosteric muscarinic agonists have been identified to date, they could be very efficacious in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "65": "The interaction between roxithromycin and midazolam was investigated in a double-blind, randomised crossover study of two phases. Ten healthy volunteers were given roxithromycin (300 mg) or placebo once daily for 6 days. On the sixth day they ingested 15 mg midazolam. Plasma samples were collected and psychomotor performance measured for 17 h. Roxithromycin administration significantly increased the area under the plasma midazolam concentration-time curve from 8.3 to 12.2 micrograms.ml-1.min and the elimination half-lives from 1.7 to 2.2 h. In psychomotor performance only minor differences were seen between the treatments in one of the measured psychomotor parameters. Thus, in contrast to the strong interaction between erythromycin and midazolam, the interaction between roxithromycin and midazolam appears less likely to be clinically significant.", 
    "66": "In order to measure the effect of industry-independent information on the prescribing of benzodiazepines in general practice, 128 primary practitioners were randomly allocated to three intervention groups after stratification by year of graduation. One third of the participating physicians were forwarded written information about the indications and limitations of benzodiazepines, another third received both written and oral information, and the remaining third (the control group) obtained no information at all. A comparison of the number of benzodiazepines prescribed per 100 patient contacts with prescription before and after the intervention showed an average decrease of 3% in the control group, of 14% in physicians who received only written information, and of 24% in physicians who were given additional oral information. Post hoc pair-wise comparisons revealed a significant difference at the 1% level in the number of benzodiazepines prescribed between physicians who received both written and oral information and the control group. A follow-up survey conducted 4 weeks after the intervention showed that the oral information campaign positively affected physicians' attitudes about the value of oral drug information from an industry-independent source.", 
    "67": "The administration of benzodiazepines at sleeping doses can be followed by an increased rate of upper airways obstruction episodes, especially in patients with an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). However, the effects of benzodiazepines at premedication doses have not yet been assessed. Therefore, fourteen patients were studied after administration of midazolam 0.08 mg.kg-1 i.m.: seven with an OSAS diagnosed previously (baseline recording) (= OSAS group) and seven without risk factors for OSAS (= Control group). The recordings were undertaken in the sleep laboratory. The airflows were assessed by nasal and oral thermistors and chest and abdominal movements by strain gauges. The electromyogram of the chin muscles was recorded, the electroencephalogram and the electro-oculogram electrodes were placed as described by RECHTSCHAFFEN and KALES. The arterial saturation in oxygen (Spo2) was monitored by pulse oximetry. All the signals were digitized and fed into a computer. The apnea was defined as a cessation of airflows for a least 10 s. The hypopnea was defined as a 10 s decrease in airflow with a drop in Spo2 of 4% or more. The respiratory event (apnea or hypopnea) was qualified as obstructive if the thoraco-abdominal movements persisted. The rate and the duration of respiratory events per sleep hour (mean +/- SEM) in OSAS group after midazolam (respectively 29.6 +/- 10 and 11.2 +/- 3.5 min) were not different from those of the baseline recording (respectively 38.4 +/- 11.6 and 12 +/- 3.5 min) and were significantly higher than in the control group (respectively 38.2 +/- 2 and 1.8 +/- 1.3 12 +/- 3.5 min) and were significantly higher than in the control group (respectively 3.8 +/- 2 and 1.8 +/- 1.3 min; p < 0.05). In the OSAS group, the percentage of sleeping time spent with a Spo2 < 90% was 1.5 +/- 1.4% during the baseline recording and 4.7 +/- 1.9% after midazolam (difference n.s.). However, a dramatic increase was observed in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "Course activations of artificial stable functional links (ASFL-II) simulating tranquilizer hidazepam were given to 36 arrhythmic patients with effort syndrome (ES) and coronary heart disease. Hemodynamic responses to ASFL-II at bicycle exercise were evaluated. It was found that ASFL diminish pressor vascular reactions and increase hemodynamic resources at bicycle exercise, especially of ES patients. The modulating activity of ASFL-II in relation to hemocirculation is attributed to alterations in the central neuromediator mechanisms.", 
    "69": "We measured the density and affinity of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand, [3H]4'-Cl-diazepam, in cardiac ventricular and liver homogenates from thyroidectomized (TX) Holtzman adult male rats, and compared these data to sham-operated controls. When data from hypothyroid tissues were compared to those of controls, the densities of PBRs were decreased in cardiac ventricles but not in liver tissue. This reduction in cardiac PBR density is opposite to what has been reported for ventricular calcium channel density in hypothyroidism. PBR affinity for the ligand was increased in both the liver and ventricular homogenates from the hypothyroid tissues, but this difference was not seen in membranes prepared from the liver homogenates. Although 4'-Cl-diazepam affinity is reported to vary between tissues from different species, this is the first report of an in vivo hormone treatment induced change in the benzodiazepine type PBR affinity. Liver tissues from both groups failed to show any interaction when radiolabeled [3H]4'-Cl-diazepam was tested against competing concentrations of thyroid hormone analogs.", 
    "70": "Since macrolide antibiotics inhibit the oxidative hepatic metabolism of various drugs, including midazolam, the present double blind studies were conducted to find out if azithromycin, a new macrolide of the azalide type, would inhibit the metabolism of midazolam and enhance the effects of midazolam on human performance. In Study I, 64 healthy medical students, divided in four parallel groups received placebo, midazolam (10 mg or 15 mg), and midazolam 10 mg combined with azithromycin (500 mg + 250 mg). In Study II, three males received oral midazolam 10 mg in combination with placebo, azithromycin or erythromycin 750 mg (as a positive control) in a cross-over trial. Objective and subjective tests were done before the intake of midazolam and 30 and 90 min after it, and venous blood was sampled for the assay of midazolam. In the placebo group in Study I, the mean numbers of letters cancelled (LC) at baseline, 30 min and 90 min were 21, 20 and 20, respectively, and the corresponding mean numbers of correct digit symbol substitutions (DSS) were 126, 137 and 140, indicating a practice effect. Midazolam 10 mg impaired these performances (21, 13 and 12 for LC, and 127, 113 and 111 for DSS). Either dose of midazolam produced clumsiness, mental slowness and poor subjective performance, midazolam 15 mg being slightly more active. The corresponding, scores in the azithromycin+midazolam group were 21, 16, 16 for LC, and 132, 121 and 119 for DSS, the only significant difference from placebo being the impairment of DSS at 90 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Recent research in molecular biology has demonstrated the complexity of GABAA receptors and shown that benzodiazepine (BZ-omega) receptor subtypes have a structural reality. It is therefore appropriate to ask whether the different pharmacological effects produced by benzodiazepines (anticonvulsant activity, anxiety reduction, motor incoordination, learning deficits, characteristic discriminative stimulus effects, tolerance and dependence) are associated with activity at different receptor subtypes. The present paper reviews the literature dealing with the behavioral effects of novel BZ (omega) receptor ligands relevant to the question of the functional significance of the BZ1 (omega 1) and BZ2 (omega 2) receptor subtypes. The only drugs currently available with a considerable degree of selectivity are alpidem and zolpidem. These compounds have relatively high affinity for GABAA receptors containing the alpha 1 subunit (corresponding to the BZ1 (omega 1) subtype) and very low affinity for receptors with the alpha 5 subunit (corresponding to one type of BZ2 (omega 2) receptor). Pharmacological effects observed with these, and other, less selective compounds allow several tentative conclusions to be drawn: (a) Little is known of the role of subtype selectivity in anxiolytic or amnestic effects but compounds with low intrinsic activity may reduce anxiety without giving rise to sedation or motor incoordination and BZ1 (omega 1) selective drugs appear to disrupt memory only at sedative doses; (b) Selectivity for BZ1 (omega 1) receptors may be associated with sleep-inducing activity but not with motor incoordination, suggesting that BZ2 (omega 2) receptors may be of particular importance in mechanisms of muscle relaxation; (c) The discriminative stimulus effects of different BZ (omega) receptor ligands are not identical and differences may be related to receptor selectivity; (d) Compounds with BZ1 (omega 1) selectivity and compounds with low intrinsic activity produce little or no tolerance and dependence. A wider range of selective compounds will be necessary to investigate these factors in detail and many different pharmacological profiles can be expected from drugs with selectivity and different levels of intrinsic activity.", 
    "72": "We have compared the effects of an intravenous infusion of propofol with those of morphine and midazolam on global brain metabolism (AVDO2) and brain perfusion following severe head injury. Fifteen patients were sedated with either a continuous infusion of propofol (mean rate 232 mg/h, range 150-400 mg/h) or infusions of morphine (mean rate 2.3 mg/h, range 0-4 mg/h) and midazolam (mean rate 2.8 mg/h, range 0-5 mg/h). Both groups were well matched for sex, age and level of coma (Glasgow coma scale) prior to sedation. Continuous data collection of AVDO2, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) began at 12 hours post injury and continued for a mean period of 40 hours. Morphine and midazolam did not have a significant effect on any of the measured parameters. Propofol led to a fall in AVDO2 from 6.0 +/- 2.6 ml/dl to 3.0 +/- 0.6 ml/dl at 4 hours. However, there was no effect on MABP, ICP or CPP. Outcome was similar in the 2 groups.", 
    "73": "Recent studies have disclosed that Mn-TPPS, a paramagnetic metalloporphyrin, may be a tumor-specific contrast media for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. We investigated whether or not Mn-TPPS enhancement of the glioma could be mediated by peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. Using a transplanted rat C6 glioma model, Mn-TPPS enhancement was performed with or without pretreatment by peripheral or central benzodiazepine-specific receptor ligands. Signal intensity analysis disclosed that the enhancement was not inhibited by these ligands. Post-contrast replacement studies showed that neither of these ligands reduced Mn-TPPS enhancement. Although the tissue concentration of Mn-TPPS was significantly higher in the glioma than in the contralateral brain, PK11195 pretreatment did not replace the intratumoral Mn-TPPS. This data suggested that the tumor-specific enhancement of Mn-TPPS was not mediated by peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "74": "6 beta-AN (6 beta-acetoxy nortropane), a novel selective M2-receptor agonist, caused decrease in FR, TV, MVV and pO2 and increase of pCO2 when intravenous injection of 10 micrograms.kg-1 in conscious rabbits or 2, 5, 20 micrograms.kg-1 in conscious dogs was given (P < 0.05 or 0.01). The inhibitory effect on MVV exhibited a dose-dependent relationship. Small doses of 6 beta-AN icv (0.5, 1, 2, 4 micrograms.kg-1 in the conscious rabbits) and iva (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 micrograms.kg-1 in anesthetized dogs) decreased FR, TV, MVV and pO2 and increased pCO2 as well. These results were reversed after administration of AF-DX116 and enhanced after administration of pirenzepine. Thus, it appears that the inhibitory action of 6 beta-AN on respiration might be related to stimulation of the inhibitory M2 cholinergic receptor in respiratory center.", 
    "75": "This article documents the first clinical observations on substance abuse related health problems from Papua New Guinea. Data were collected and presented on 30 young Melanesians (28 males and two females) who were admitted to the Port Moresby General Hospital with health problems directly associated with substance (alcohol, cannabis and diazepam) abuse. The patients were aged between 15 and 35 years. The male to female ratio was 14 to 1. The author arrived at the conclusion that substance abuse related health problems which were noted to be absent in 1981, are now on the increase in Papua New Guinea. Further clinical research followed by health education for the youth of the country is recommended as an important task for all health workers.", 
    "76": "We used in vitro quantitative autoradiography to investigate changes in neurotransmitter receptor binding, including muscarinic cholinergic, PCP, GABAA, benzodiazepine, D1 and 5-HT2A receptor, in the brains of aged rats, compared with such binding in young rats. Scatchard analysis revealed that the maximal number of binding sites for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) in the caudate/putamen and accumbens was significantly decreased in aged rats compared with young rats, while its affinity remained unchanged. The specific binding of [3H]N-(1-[2-thienyl]cyclohexyl)3,4-piperidine (TCP) for the ion channels coupled with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the caudate/putamen and hippocampus was significantly decreased in aged rats compared with young rats. The [3H]muscimol binding in aged rats was decreased in all brain regions examined compared with that in young rats, whereas [3H]flunitrazepam binding was not changed in any brain regions. The [3H]SCH23390 binding for dopamine D1 receptors was significantly increased in the parietal cortex, but decreased in the caudate/putamen and accumbens of aged rats compared with that in young rats. The [3H]ketanserin binding for 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex and accumbens was significantly decreased in aged rats compared with young rats. These results suggest that uneven changes in receptors for various neurotransmitters throughout the brain may be responsible for the decline of brain function in aged rats.", 
    "77": "Few cases of mexiletine overdose have been reported in the literature. The available case reports have invariably noted significant hemodynamic or electrocardiographic abnormalities. A 41-year-old woman, on mexiletine for arrhythmia control, ingested up to 90 of her 200 mg mexiletine tablets in a suicide attempt. She presented to the emergency department awake with a normal blood pressure and pulse. Shortly afterwards, the patient had a generalized motor seizure, which responded after 40 minutes to intravenous diazepam 100 mg, phenobarbital 1 g and pyridoxine 5 g. Recurrent status epilepticus at one hour required an additional 40 mg of diazepam and a loading dose of pentobarbital. During the entire episode, her electrocardiogram remained normal. The patient's mexiletine level was 20 micrograms/mL (therapeutic 1-2 micrograms/mL) and the patient's urine screen was negative for cocaine. Mexiletine is a group Ib antidysrhythmic agent with electrophysiologic effects similar to lidocaine. Mexiletine has a little first pass hepatic metabolism and a large volume of distribution along with a high lipid solubility, and prolonged central nervous system toxicity may be expected. As with lidocaine, the toxic deaths from mexiletine have resulted from hypotension and bradycardia. The patient reported had a significant mexiletine overdose which resulted in convulsive status epilepticus, but was devoid of hemodynamic or electrocardiographic abnormalities.",

While not significant, the infusion rate tended to decrease with increasing age of the patient (Spearman's p = -0.51; p = 0.11). The steady-state plasma concentration range was 10-147 ng/ml, with a median of 30 ng/ml. Infusion rates and plasma concentrations of midazolam were correlated (Spearman's p = 0.71; p < 0.05). No other significant relationships were found between plasma concentrations and the variables of age, sex and liver function.",

    "86": "A group of 19 middle aged patients suffering from primary insomnia according to the DSM-III-R were treated in a single-blind study with trimipramine, a sedating antidepressant. A total of 15 patients completed the study protocol and were evaluated. The present pilot study aimed at investigating the sleep-inducing properties of trimipramine, and at clarifying the question of whether short- or long-term rebound insomnia occurs after discontinuation of this drug. At four measurement points, i.e. under baseline conditions, under treatment and 4 and 14 days after drug discontinuation, sleep was recorded with an ambulatory-electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring device in the patient's home environment. Simultaneously, psychometric tests were applied to measure withdrawal symptoms, subjective sleep quality and well-being during daytime. Trimipramine at a mean dose of 166 +/- 48 mg led to a significant increase in sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and stage 2% sleep-period time (SPT), whereas a significant decrease in wake time and stage 1% SPT was noted. Insomniac patients reported an improvement in subjectively perceived sleep quality following trimipramine. Additionally, an improvement in well-being during the daytime occurred. Negative side effects were limited to dry mouth due to the anticholinergic properties of the drug. Discontinuation of trimipramine did not provoke either short- or long-term rebound insomnia in objective and subjective sleep measurements considering mean values of the whole sample, although a subgroup of patients did display total sleep times below baseline values during short- and long-term withdrawal, but generally without a concomitant worsening of sleep quality according to the sleep questionnaire.", 
    "87": "For a number of years, dysthymia was considered to be non-responsive to antidepressant treatment. During the last decade, early studies with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) demonstrated the superiority of the TCAs over placebo. The side effect profile of the TCAs and the moderate degree of symptomatology resulted in reduced compliance and thus to the clinical impression of lack of efficacy. The newest generation of antidepressants, the SRRIs and the RIMAs, with their more acceptable side effect profiles, allowed for the adequate evaluation of pharmacotherapy in dysthymia. The initial open studies with SSRIs indicate a clear efficacy of this group of antidepressants. Likewise, a 5HT2 antagonist, ritanserin, has been shown to be superior to placebo. More recently, a large placebo-controlled study of moclobemide, a RIMA, clearly demonstrated the superiority of this drug over placebo. Based on this evidence, it is now appropriate to consider antidepressants as a clearly effective method of treating dysthymia.", 
    "88": "Activation of the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex has previously been shown to inhibit the release proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-related peptides from the hypothalamus and to decrease mRNA levels in POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus. To learn more about the precise role of the GABAergic system in POMC neuron regulation, we studied the effects of the administration (2 days) of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and the central-type barbiturate receptor agonist pentobarbital on POMC mRNA levels measured by in situ hybridization. Treatment with pentobarbital produced a 12% decrease in the hybridization signal. Similarly, muscimol treatment decreased the signal by 20%. The concomitant administration of the two GABAA receptor agonists resulted in a decrease (28%) of mRNA levels that was significantly more marked than that induced by pentobarbital or muscimol alone. The present results, together with previous data from our laboratory, indicate that different activators of the GABAA receptor complex, including barbiturates, can negatively regulate POMC neuronal activity in the rat arcuate nucleus.",

    "90": "The MAO inhibitor phenelzine (2-phenylethylhydrazine; PLZ) is used widely in psychiatry for the treatment of depression and panic disorder. Its N-acetyl metabolite, N2-acetylphenelzine (N2AcPLZ) is a reasonably potent nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) that causes elevation in brain levels of the biogenic amines. In the studies reported here, PLZ (0.05 mmol/kg/day), N2AcPLZ (0.10 mmol/kg/day) or vehicle were administered to male rats for 28 days s.c. with Alzet minipumps, and their effects on GABAergic function were examined. Whole brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were significantly elevated in the PLZ but not in the N2AcPLZ-treated group. PLZ was found to inhibit the anabolic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and, to a greater extent, the catabolic enzyme GABA transaminase (GABA-T). The results of these investigations suggest that the free hydrazine moiety in PLZ is crucial to producing the elevated levels of GABA, probably through inhibition of GABA-T. Despite the considerable increase in whole brain GABA levels in the PLZ-treated rats, there were no significant differences in GABAA or benzodiazepine receptor binding parameters (KD or Bmax) between the groups as measured using 3H-muscimol and 3H-flunitrazepam in radioligand binding assays.",

    "93": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an important trophic hormone for the pancreas, and CCK receptors are present on pancreatic carcinoma cells. We sought to determine whether either CCK itself or an antagonist of CCK could modulate the sensitivity of the human pancreatic cell line MIA-PaCa2 to cisplatin (DDP). The IC50 for a 1-h exposure to DDP was 35.3 +/- 3.2(SD) microM. Exposure to CCK8 octapeptide at physiologic and supra-physiologic concentrations did not alter the sensitivity of MIA-PaCa2 cells to DDP. The CCK receptor antagonist MK-329 was directly cytotoxic to the MIA-PaCa2 cells on a constant exposure schedule with an IC50 of 9.5 +/- 1.4 (SD) microM. MK-329 enhanced the sensitivity of MIA-PaCa2 cells to DDP by a factor of 3.5, and the interaction between DDP and MK-329 was shown to be synergistic by median-effect analysis. At a level of 50% cell kill, the combination index was 0.58 +/- 0.10. The ability of MK-329 to sensitize cells to DDP was schedule-dependent and required prolonged exposure to the antagonist following a 1-h exposure to DDP. MK-329 had no effect on the uptake of a radiolabeled analog of cisplatin ([3H]-dichloro(ethylenediamine)platinum) and did not affect intracellular glutathione content. MK-329 had no effect on the cell-cycle-phase distribution of MIA-PaCa2 cells and did not alter the DDP-induced cell-cycle perturbations. The cytotoxic effect of MK-329 and its ability to interact synergistically with DDP could not be reversed by CCK. We conclude that MK-329 is directly cytotoxic to pancreatic carcinoma cells and can enhance their sensitivity to DDP by a mechanism not related to its ability to antagonize the CCK receptor.",

In order to assess the presence of anxiolytic properties in cannabidiol (CBD) derivatives HU-219, HU-252 and HU-261, these drugs were tested in rats submitted to the elevated plus-maze model of anxiety. 2. Additional groups received diazepam or CBD. HU-219 (0.03-1 mg/kg) and CBD (5 mg/kg) significantly increased the percentage of open arm entries without changing the total number of entries, an anxiolytic-like effect. 3. Both HU-252 and HU-261 increased the percentage of time spent in open arms and the total number of entries, but only at the dose of 1 mg/kg. 4. Diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) increased both the percentage of entries and time spent on open arms and the total number of entries. 5. The results confirm previous findings with CBD and indicate that its derivative HU-219 may possess a similar anxiolytic-like profile. 6.

    "100": "Cholecystokinin is a principal mediator of intestinal fat-induced inhibition of gastric acid secretion, indicating that it is an important physiological enterogastrone. Cholecystokinin has been shown to inhibit acid secretion by activation of type A CCK receptors and through a mechanism involving somatostatin. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that these two mechanisms are directly related such that activation of type A CCK receptors by CCK causes the release of somatostatin. We tested this hypothesis in vivo in a study of CCK-stimulated release of somatostatin in dogs and in vitro in a study of CCK-stimulated release of somatostatin from an enriched culture of canine fundic D cells. In dogs, IV infusion of CCK (50 pmol/kg/h, IV) significantly increased circulating somatostatin concentrations above basal. Further, systemic administration of somatostatin MAb F(ab)1 fragments of a somatostatin monoclonal antibody prevented most of CCK-induced inhibition of meal-stimulated acid secretion. In canine fundic D cells in culture, CCK-stimulated somatostatin release was blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by application of a type A CCK receptor antagonist. This study indicates that CCK activates type A CCK receptors to release somatostatin from canine fundic mucosal D cells, and accounts for somatostatin-dependent CCK-induced inhibition of acid secretion."
