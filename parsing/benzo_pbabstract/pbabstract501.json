    "0": "Vomiting was suppressed in cats pretreated with 8-OH-DPAT and then challenged with an emetic stimulus; motion, xylazine or cisplatin. The antiemetic effect is likely due to stimulation of postsynaptic serotonin-1A receptors. The most parsimonious explanation is that it acts at a convergent structure, presumably at or near the vomiting center. If so, 8-OH-DPAT may block emesis elicited by virtually any other stimulus. A supplementary experiment revealed that lorazepam suppressed motion sickness at a dose that produced ataxia, but did not suppress xylazine-induced emesis. These results do not support the possibility that the antiemetic effects of 8-OH-DPAT were the result of anxiolytic activity.", 
    "1": "Cardiopulmonary bypass is accompanied by profound changes in the organism that may alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Drug distribution can be altered, for example, by changes in blood flow and by haemodilution, with a decrease in protein binding; a decrease in the elimination of some drugs can be caused by impairment of renal or hepatic clearance, due, for example, to lowered perfusion and hypothermia. The subject was reviewed in the Journal in 1982, and the emphasis of the present review is on new data related to specific drugs. The following substances are dealt with: benzodiazepines, cephalosporins, digitalis glycosides, general anaesthetics, glyceryl trinitrate (nitroglycerin), lignocaine (lidocaine), muscle relaxants, nitroprusside, opiates, papaverine and propranolol. For many of these substances an abrupt decrease has been observed in serum concentration upon initiation of bypass, which is explained by haemodilution and an increase in distribution due to decreased protein binding. For nitrates and some opiates, adsorption to the bypass apparatus was shown to be important. The gradual increase in serum concentrations seen during cardiopulmonary bypass with some drugs after the initial fall is usually explained by redistribution of the drug and/or decrease in its elimination. The same phenomena are thought to explain why in the post-bypass period a concentration increase occurs, or at least a slower decrease than expected. However, drug elimination has been directly measured in only a few studies. The short duration of the bypass procedure and the continuous changes during the process hamper a rigorous pharmacokinetic evaluation. Studies allowing more precise understanding of the mechanisms underlying the observed concentration changes are needed, but are difficult to design. Similarly, more data are awaited on the pharmacodynamic and clinical consequences of the concentration changes.", 
    "2": "Although depression is a well recognised component of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome there have, as yet, been no convincing reports of mania. We report two cases of mania induced by abrupt discontinuation of lorazepam. Both cases were treated by reintroduction of the benzodiazepine followed by gradual dose reduction.", 
    "3": "We have retrospectively analyzed the results of the pooled data from three 6-week placebo controlled double blind phase III clinical trials, initially designed to assess the efficacy of newer antidepressants, in order to study the relationship of early onset improvement with later outcome in 145 depressed outpatients receiving placebo (n = 98) or imipramine (n = 47). The early onset response was seen in a subgroup of subjects receiving either imipramine or placebo and appeared to be independent of treatment assignment. Furthermore, the early onset response predicted outcome for the duration of the trial and was not selective as defined by specific changes in subscales measuring insomnia, anxiety or endogenous features. Exclusion of early onset responders resulted in the augmentation of the difference in outcome with drug and placebo. We recommend that future placebo controlled trials assessing therapeutic efficacy of active treatments in depressed outpatients take into account the early onset response in the analysis of results.", 
    "4": "Experiments were carried on in the Wistar rats having self-stimulation (SS) electrodes implanted chronically in substantia nigra-ventral tegmental area (SN-VTA) to examine whether modulations of GABAergic, serotonergic, histaminergic, dopaminergic, and glucocorticoid neuronal receptor functions will affect or not the brain reward system and the SS behaviour. The modulators are the wellknown drugs: diazepam which is a facilitator of some of the GABA receptors, and used clinically for its tranquilizing, anxiolytic, sedative-hypnotic and anti-convulsant properties; sodium valproate which is known to enhance the GABA synapse function, and used clinically for its anti-convulsant property; haloperidol which is a dopaminergic receptor (D2) blocker, and clinically used for its anti-psychotic property; cyproheptadine which is both anti-histaminic and anti-serotonergic (blocks 5-HT2 receptor), used clinically for its antihistaminic and other beneficial properties; and hydrocortisone which is the stress-resisting glucocorticoid having direct effects on both brain and body cells, used clinically for the wide-ranging glucocorticoid therapeutic effects. The results revealed that systemic administration of these drugs, except haloperidol, caused no significant influence on the SS behaviour, thereby indicating that these nondopaminergic drugs have no effect on brain-reward system and also these categories of synaptic actions are not likely to be involved in the primary organization of the mechanisms of the brain-reward system.", 
    "5": "Thirteen critically ill patients received flumazenil after multiple doses, or an infusion, of midazolam was used as part of a sedation regimen to facilitate intensive care. All patients remained excessively sedated after the midazolam was stopped for 6 hours or longer. An improvement in conscious level occurred in eight patients (61%). In four of these eight patients, the duration of action of flumazenil necessitated its continued administration by an infusion to maintain the improvement in conscious level. The dose of flumazenil required each hour was less than estimated previously; this indicates that it may be subjected to similar alterations of elimination as those described for midazolam. Flumazenil appears to be a useful drug for the reversal of prolonged benzodiazepine sedation but repeated bolus doses or an infusion are needed if significant accumulation of benzodiazepines has occurred.", 
    "6": "An anaesthetic regime was developed for lung transplantation in the dog using a continuous infusion of alfentanil and midazolam. This combination of agents provided excellent analgesia and also produced loss of consciousness. Cardiovascular stability was well maintained over a 24-h period of anaesthesia following lung transplantation. Although no animals were allowed to recover from anaesthesia in the present series, the regime described is likely to be suitable for recovery anaesthesia, particularly since both of the agents used can be reversed with specific antagonists.", 
    "7": "A survey of psychotropic drug prescription was conducted in Verona using information obtained from 92 GPs. A total of 2559 patients consulted their GPs on the day of the study and 14.2% of them received a prescription for a psychotropic drug. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently prescribed: 72.8% and 70.4% of all psychotropic prescriptions in women and men respectively. The prevalence of prescription was higher in women than in men (15.8% vs 11.2%) and the difference was statistically significant (P less than 0.001). Subjects aged 45-64 had the highest chance of receiving prescriptions for psychotropics. Occupational status seems related to psychotropic drug prescription only in women. A strong association was found between psychotropic drug prescription and conspicuous psychiatric morbidity. This association was independent of sex, age, and occupational status. An interactive effect between social problems and sex on psychotropic drug prescription was found. The perception by the GP of a social problem increases the risk that a psychotropic will be prescribed about twice in women, but not in men.", 
    "8": "Frequent unwanted side effects and development of tolerance are the main disadvantages of clonazepam (CZP) in long-term treatment of epileptic patients. A review of the literature shows that CZP tolerance more often appears in severe forms of childhood epilepsy (West and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes) than in other epileptic syndromes. We prospectively studied the consequences of CZP discontinuation in 40 consecutive children with difficult-to-treat epilepsies and multiple-drug therapy. The CZP was reduced stepwise in a variable daily reduction rate (0.003-0.16 mg/kg), while serum levels of the comedication were kept unchanged. In only three children (7.5%), CZP was believed to have had some antiepileptic effect; in 30 (75%) it had been ineffective, whereas in six (15%), a decrease in seizure frequency after CZP discontinuation even suggested a negative therapeutic effect. Discontinuation symptoms, mostly in the form of a transitory exacerbation of seizure frequency, occurred in 19 children (47.5%). These children had a significantly higher CZP dose and longer duration of treatment than did children without discontinuation symptoms, but there was no difference between the two groups related to the rate of CZP discontinuance.", 
    "9": "EMA (eyelid myoclonia with absences) consists of brief seizures triggered by eyelid closure and characterized by absence and palpebral myoclonia. The EEG shows brief discharges with 3 per second spike and wave complexes. The present report describes the cases of 2 monovular twins who started to have this form of epilepsy at the age of 4 1/2 years. Their seizures, after 2 years of follow-up, are greatly reduced with combined therapy of valproic acid and benzodiazepines (Clobazam).", 
    "10": "The EEG effects of a single oral dose of diazepam, amitriptyline and pernazine were studied in 26 healthy volunteers. The EEG analysis was performed by means of FFT and a new parametric method FAD. The results indicate that the FAD method reveals drug changes significantly more often than does the FFT analysis and that the medication effects are more clearly defined by the FAD. The method can be useful in the assessment of the subtle effects of the psychotropic drugs.", 
    "11": "Selective episodic prophylactic home treatment with rectal diazepam in children with febrile convulsions should reduce the risks of permanent long term anticonvulsive drug therapy. To evaluate this approach and its side effects, selective prophylaxis (rectal diazepam, 0.6 mg x kg at 8 to 12 hour intervals) was given to 15 children with previous febrile convulsions whenever their axillary temperature raised to 38 C degrees or over. They were followed up for a mean of 7.73 months (range 3 to 20 months). In a total of 27 febrile episodes only 2 seizures occurred, each to a different patient and in both cases when treatment was inadvertently withheld. No recurrences were observed in the remaining 13 patients involving 25 treated febrile crisis. The small number of patients precluded evaluation of the effects of risk factors in recurrence rates. Mild and transient collateral effects were detected in 46.6% patients and in 32.0% of the observed febrile periods. In spite of the small number of patients and short follow-up period these results suggest, that episodic, non permanent, treatment with rectal diazepam is an appropriate alternative to traditional continuous oral anticonvulsive therapy for children with febrile convulsions.", 
    "12": "(1) In the lumen-perfused mouse stomach in vitro, potential sites of gastric antisecretory action of the muscarine M1-receptor antagonist telenzepine were investigated. Acid secretion was stimulated by the muscarinic agonist McN-A-343 (1-1000 mumol/l). Neither basal nor McN-A-343-stimulated acid secretion was affected by 1 mumol/l TTX indicating that neuronal structures were probably not involved. (2) Acid secretion stimulated by 10 mumol/l McN-A-343 was inhibited by telenzepine (0.1-1.4 mumol/l) and cimetidine (10-140 mumol/l). Neither of the antagonists affected basal acid secretion. TTX had no inhibitory influence on the antagonist effect of telenzepine and cimetidine. (3) Compound 48/80 (100 mumol/l), which depletes histamine stores, initially mimicked but subsequently prevented the effect of McN-A-343. Prenylamine (50 mumol/l), which prevents histamine release, also abolished the secretagogue effect of subsequently administered McN-A-343. (4) Up to concentrations greater than 100 mumol/l, McN-A-343 did not stimulate acid production in rabbit isolated fundic glands and guinea-pig isolated parietal cells. Thus, parietal cells are not directly stimulated by McN-A-343. (5) Based on the site of action of the agonist McN-A-343 in the mouse isolated stomach and its failure to stimulate parietal cells from different species directly, it is concluded that telenzepine blocks, in the mouse isolated stomach, muscarine receptors located on paracrine cells to reduce endogenous histamine release.", 
    "13": "Midazolam has not yet been investigated for its possible properties as a histamine releaser. The aim of the following study was to ascertain whether histamine release follows the i.v. injection of midazolam. METHODS. Twenty patients between 18 and 58 years of age were split into two groups at random. Either 0.15 mg/kg midazolam or 0.15 ml/kg NaCl 0.9% were injected i.v. Venous blood was drawn 2 min before and 2, 5, and 10 min after each injection. The content of histamine in plasma was determined by HPLC. RESULTS. In the midazolam group, histamine levels decreased from 0.37 ng/ml to 0.29 ng/ml after 5 min (P less than 0.05). The kinetics typical of histamine release could not be observed in any of the patients. We observed a slight decrease in the blood pressure or tachycardia in 3 patients, but even in these cases there was no increase in histamine level. In the NaCl group, the histamine level decreased from 0.34 ng/ml to 0.23 ng/ml after 2 min (P less than 0.05). The hemodynamics of these patients remained unchanged. One patient had an abnormally high histamine level prior to the injection (2.33 ng/ml). CONCLUSION. Our results show that midazolam is not a histamine releaser. The relevance of 1 patient having a high baseline level of histamine remains unclear.", 
    "14": "Previous studies have demonstrated that cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin, and structurally related peptides can interact with various types of receptors that can be distinguished by their relative affinities for agonists and antagonists. In the present study we examined the effect of gastrin, the COOH-terminal octapeptide of CCK (CCK-8), and the tetrapeptide of CCK (CG-4) on contraction of dispersed gastric smooth muscle cells from guinea pig and tested the ability of various CCK receptor antagonists to affect agonist-induced muscle cell contraction. For purposes of comparison we tested the effect of each antagonist on CCK-stimulated amylase secretion by pancreatic acini from guinea pig. On gastric smooth muscle cells, CCK-8, gastrin, and CG-4 were all full agonists. CCK-8 and gastrin were equipotent and CG-4 was 6,000-fold less potent. Each antagonist caused inhibition of CCK-stimulated contraction with relative potencies (IC50): L364,718 (4 microM) = CBZ-CCK-(27-32)-NH2 (3 microM) greater than proglumide analogue 10 (90 microM). Inhibition by each of the antagonists was competitive in nature, specific for CCK peptides, and each had the same IC50 whether contraction was stimulated by CCK-8, gastrin, or CG-4. Relative potencies (IC50) of the three antagonists for inhibiting CCK-stimulated amylase release from pancreatic acini were L364,718 (3 nM) greater than proglumide analogue 10 (200 nM) greater than CBZ-CCK-(27-32)-NH2 (3 microM). These results demonstrate that gastric smooth muscle cells possess receptors that differ from CCK receptors on pancreatic acini in terms of affinities for both agonists and certain antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "15": "We examined the ability of the recently described 3-(benzoylamino)benzodiazepine analogue L365,260 and the 3-(acylamino)benzodiazepine analogue L364,718 to distinguish gastrin from pancreatic cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors. Neither L365,260 nor L364,718 when present alone (1 microM) caused stimulation of amylase release from guinea pig pancreatic acini or caused contraction of smooth muscle cells from guinea pig stomach. Each analogue inhibited CCK-stimulated amylase release, gastrin-17-I-stimulated smooth muscle contraction, binding of 125I-Bolton-Hunter-cholecystokinin octapeptide (125I-BH-CCK-8) to pancreatic CCK receptors, and binding of 125I-gastrin-17-I to gastrin receptors on pancreatic acini. L365,260, (Ki, 7.3 +/- 0.8 nM) was 50-70 times more potent than L364,718 at inhibiting binding of 125I-gastrin to pancreatic acini or gastrin-stimulated smooth muscle contraction. In contrast, L364,718 (Ki, 4 +/- 1 nM) was 145-200 times more potent than L365,260 at inhibiting binding of 125I-BH-CCK-8 to pancreatic acini or CCK-stimulated amylase release. Neither L364,718 nor L365,260 distinguished between high- and low-affinity CCK binding sites. L365,260 and L364,718 did not inhibit binding of radiolabeled vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, bombesin, substance P, or N-methylscopolamine to pancreatic acini. These results demonstrate that, in contrast to other gastrin-CCK receptor antagonists described, L365,260 is a selective gastrin receptor antagonist having an 80-fold higher affinity for gastrin than pancreatic CCK receptor, whereas L364,718 has a 125-fold higher affinity for pancreatic CCK receptors. Because of the selectivity of these two antagonists the involvement of CCK and gastrin in various physiological processes can be differentiated even when both receptors occur on the same cell.",

These antibodies were shown to react with the denatured GABAA receptor alpha subunit, Mr 53,000, in Western blots with both purified receptor and brain membranes as antigens. Also, both antibodies recognised both the purified and detergent-solubilised GABAA receptor as demonstrated by dose-dependent specific immunoprecipitation of the GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites from solution.

    "17": "Electron-capture gas chromatography was carried out to determine midazolam and its three hydroxy metabolites (1-hydroxymethylmidazolam, 4-hydroxymidazolam and 1-hydroxymethyl-4-hydroxymidazolam) in human plasma. The assay involves extraction from plasma, buffered to pH 9.3, into cyclohexane-dichloromethane (6:4) and analysis by gas chromatography. The use of an HP-17 cross-linked, capillary column makes derivatization unnecessary. The sensitivity of the method was 2-3 ng/ml for midazolam, 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam, and 20 ng/ml for 1-hydroxymethyl-4-hydroxymidazolam. The extraction recovery of midazolam, 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam, 4-hydroxymidazolam and 1-hydroxymethyl-4-hydroxymidazolam was 99.3 +/- 2.4, 67.0 +/- 4.6, 92.7 +/- 4.7 and 28.7 +/- 6.3%, respectively. This gas chromatographic assay was used to assess the concentration-time profiles of midazolam and its metabolites in human plasma after rectal and intravenous administration of midazolam.", 
    "18": "A gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric procedure has been developed for the quantitation of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil in human plasma. The assay utilizes an extraction at alkaline pH with benzene-dichloroethane (80:20), selective ion monitoring, isobutane positive-ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry and stable isotope dilution. The method has been used to measure plasma concentrations of flumazenil in over 1500 clinical samples over a range of 0.5-200 ng/ml (using 2 ml of plasma).", 
    "19": "To determine whether benzodiazepine receptors in the locus coeruleus (LC) regulate the firing of LC neurons, the effects of systemic, intracerebroventricular, and local administration of various benzodiazepines on LC activity were compared. Systemic administration of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and alprazolam in anesthetized rats markedly attenuated sensory-evoked activity of LC neurons while also suppressing, but to a lesser degree, spontaneous LC firing rates. When microinfused into the LC region, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and alprazolam reduced spontaneous LC firing rates to the same extent observed following systemic administration; however, unlike systemic administration, infusion of benzodiazepines into the LC failed to attenuate evoked LC activity. Similarly, intracerebroventricular administration of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide suppressed spontaneous, but not evoked, LC activity. These findings indicate that benzodiazepines suppress spontaneous LC firing by stimulating benzodiazepine receptors in the LC while attenuating evoked LC activity by stimulating benzodiazepine receptors that are neither in the LC nor accessible to benzodiazepines introduced into the ventricular system.", 
    "20": "A prospective double-blind cross-over investigation was undertaken among 46 geriatric patients (62-92 years) in which either 5 mg nitrazepam or 1 mg lorazepam were administered as hypnotics for two periods of ten days. No significant differences were observed in the quality of sleep but the objective psychomotor tests and the patients' subjective experience of hang-overs showed that there were significant differences in the frequencies of side effects in favour of lorazepam. It is concluded that daytime sedation after repetitive administration of a benzodiazepine preparation depends upon the half-life and that side effects are revealed better by psychomotor tests than by intellectual, cognitive tests and that lorazepam should be given preference to nitrazepam as a hypnotic for elderly patients.", 
    "21": "This laboratory has reported recently that muscarinic receptor-stimulated release of norepinephrine from pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells is dependent upon an influx of Ca2+ through a Ca2+ channel that is regulated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein (G-protein) (Inoue, K., and Kenimer J. G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8157-8161). In the present study, we have examined the role of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in this mechanism. The muscarinic agonist methacholine was shown to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis by a mechanism that was sensitive to pertussis toxin inhibition. When assayed in the absence of Ca2+, muscarinic-stimulated norepinephrine release but not phosphoinositide hydrolysis was blocked. Conversely, muscarinic-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis but not norepinephrine release was blocked in cells preincubated with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. In contrast to several previous hypotheses that suggested that muscarinic-stimulated neurotransmitter release is dependent upon phosphoinositide hydrolysis, our results suggest that these two muscarinic-stimulated processes are independent events in PC12 cells. Inhibition studies with muscarinic receptor subtype-specific antagonists suggest that norepinephrine release is regulated by an M2 subtype muscarinic receptor and that phosphoinositide hydrolysis is regulated by an M3 subtype muscarinic receptor.", 
    "22": "The effects of altered albumin distribution on the apparent volume of distribution (V) and the apparent elimination rate constant (kappa) of drugs were investigated by a simulation analysis. The Equations derived by Oie et al. were modified for this purpose. Within the range observed in normal healthy subjects and patients, the change in albumin distribution significantly affected V of drugs but, in general, not kappa. For drugs with more than 90% plasma-protein binding, V changed by more than 100%. The change in plasma-protein binding caused by an altered albumin distribution produced a greater effect on V than that caused by an altered albumin amount. These results suggest that albumin distribution is an important factor in controlling the kinetics of drugs which are highly bound to plasma protein. This is illustrated using midazolam as an example.", 
    "23": "The affinity and density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites and the ability of flunitrazepam to augment GABA-activated chloride flux were determined using membrane vesicles prepared from cortex of long-sleep (LS, alcohol-sensitive), short-sleep (SS, alcohol-resistant) and individual heterogeneous stock (HS) mice. LS membranes were more sensitive than SS membranes to the effects of flunitrazepam (and ethanol) on chloride flux but did not differ in the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam. Likewise, individual HS mice displayed marked differences in enhancement of chloride flux by flunitrazepam, but little difference in binding of flunitrazepam. These results suggest that there is little genetic variation in the binding of benzodiazepines to receptors, but there is a marked diversity in the coupling of these receptors to chloride channels. This implies the existence of 'spare receptors' in LS and most HS mice, but not in SS mice. These findings also suggest that genetic differences in alcohol sensitivity in vivo may be related to coupling of benzodiazepine binding to chloride channel function.", 
    "24": "Developments in the medical management of anxiety tend, over the last two decades, to have clustered around modifications to the early benzodiazepines. These developments have given the psychiatrist a wide range of options in terms of intensity and duration of action but have carried with them the range of penalties associated with the benzodiazepines as a group. These include among others addiction potential and a sometimes inappropriate level of sedation. The need has been for a new drug, unrelated to the benzodiazepines and which is more specifically orientated towards anxiety. Buspirone, it seems, may well be such a drug. This paper discusses the anxiety disorders, the drug management of anxiety, the problems associated with traditional anxiolytics and the recent availability of a new class of drug in this indication.", 
    "25": "Knowledge of benefits and risks of these substances are important for a low-risk-treatment with hypnotics. Different questions occur, such as short- oder long-acting hypnotics? Disturbing interactions? Duration of therapy? Risks of amnesia? Insomnia of old people? Alternatives to Benzodiazepin-Hypnotics? In each case the application of these hypnotics should follow along the \"3 S Line\": straight indication, small dose, short application. There does not exist an universal principle of therapy for people who suffer from insomnia. This serious disease is often very agonizing for them. As a pharmacologic instrument there is yet no alternative to Benzodiazepines.", 
    "26": "A shortening of sleep duration is going along with aging. Several somatic diseases and different psychiatric disorders, which increasingly occur in old people cause sleep disorders. Thus patients suffering from disturbed sleep must be examined carefully before treatment. Benzodiazepines and Clomethiazol are potent and save drugs for sleep disorders in the aged. Antidepressants and neuroleptics should be applicated only for sleep disorders caused by underlying psychiatric diseases.", 
    "27": "The problem area of chronic insomnia will be discussed in view of diagnostic, causal and therapeutic aspects. A duration of an insomnia more than 3 weeks is regarded as chronic, it demands a detailed anamnestic interview as well as physical examinations. The chronic intake of hypnotics rather often causes insomnia. The reversible influence of chronic intake of hypnotics on polygraphic sleep parameters are shown during withdrawal, which was carried out stepwise. Alternative therapeutic strategies are discussed.", 
    "28": "Conventional stress bleeding prophylaxis with antacids or histamine (H2)-antagonists, as well as the newer mucosa-protective drugs pirenzepine and sucralfate, are satisfying most of the clinicians with regard to efficacy of stress bleeding prevention. Therefore, potential side effects are attaining crucial importance with regard to the drugs to be used. Pharmacologic blockade of cardiac H2-receptors increases the risk of bradycardia and negative inotropic effects as well as coronary vasoconstriction at least in the presence of elevated plasma histamine levels. Intracardiac injection of pirenzepine can lead to temporary tachycardia. Elderly patients have been shown to be at an increased risk of side effects to the central nervous system when treated with H2-antagonists. These drugs can also induce toxic effects in the liver. Cimetidine leads to interactions with a number of drugs used in the intensive care unit. In patients with pre-existing pulmonary diseases, H2-antagonists have been demonstrated to increase pulmonary bronchoconstriction. Alkalinization of the gastric juice is associated with a significant increase in colonization of gram-negative bacteria in the stomach. In intubated patients, aspiration of stomach contents occurs in 30 to 40 percent of the patients. A number of studies have shown a direct correlation between alkalinization of the gastric juice and pulmonary infections. Sucralfate and to a lesser degree pirenzepine can reduce the risk of pulmonary infections. Sucralfate also exerts a bactericidal effect. Recent investigations support the hypothesis that alkalinization of the stomach also increases the risk of systemic infections. This may be the main reason for the observation that at least in ventilated patients sucralfate, unlike H2-antagonists or antacids, leads to a significant reduction of the mortality rate compared with conventional stress bleeding prophylaxis.", 
    "29": "The present study examines the muscarinic receptor binding characteristics of parent human neuroblastoma (SK-N-SH) and its neuroblast (SH-SY5Y) and epithelial-like (SH-EP1) clones using [3H]methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS). Specific [3H]NMS binding to intact SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y cells was saturable with a Kd of 0.2 nM and Bmax of 100-150 fmol/mg protein. Specific [3H]NMS binding to whole cell preparations of SH-EP 1 could not be detected. Pharmacological analysis of the binding site both in whole cells and membranes of SK-N-SH are indicative of an homogeneous receptor population possessing low affinity for the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine. The muscarinic receptors expressed by the neuroblast clone, SH-SY5Y were further characterized and shown to have the properties of an homogeneous M3 subtype with low affinity for the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine and the M2-cardioselective AFDX-116 but high affinity for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP). In conclusion the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma should provide an important human neuronal cell model with which to define the regulation of post-receptor events driven by a single receptor population.", 
    "30": "The intrinsic effects of the benzodiazepine receptor ligand beta-CMC (3-(methoxycarbonyl)-amino-beta-carboline) and its interaction with the anticonvulsant and sedative effects of diazepam were assessed. beta-CMC (100 mg/kg i.p.) significantly elevated seizure threshold to bicuculline. beta-CMC (10 mg/kg) failed to alter the anticonvulsant action of diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.), but significantly attenuated diazepam's sedative effect. A higher dose of beta-CMC (40 mg/kg) did attenuate diazepam's anticonvulsant action. The data suggest that beta-CMC is a partial agonist at benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "31": "The binding of the enantiomers of telenzepine to muscarinic receptor subtypes present in guinea-pig cerebral cortex, myocardium and salivary glands has been examined. The (+) enantiomer is more potent in all assays and exhibits a greater selectivity than the (-) enantiomer for the different receptor subtypes. As a consequence, the enantiomeric potency ratio varies from ca. 400 (cortical 'M1' receptors) to ca. 50 (cardiac receptors). In functional assays in vitro in the rabbit vas deferens and rat atria, the affinity constants and enantiomeric potency ratios for the two isomers agree with those found for the appropriate muscarinic receptor subtype in binding assays. A high enantiomeric potency ratio, 180, is found in vivo for the ability of the telenzepine enantiomers to inhibit the production of lesions in the modified Shay rat preparation. The data are compatible with the blockade of M1 receptors by (+)-telenzepine being responsible for this action of telenzepine and would tend to exclude the possibility that the anti-ulcer action of telenzepine is mediated via a muscarinic or non-muscarinic action of the (-) enantiomer.", 
    "32": "Acetylcholine (1-10 microM) depolarized the membrane and stimulated glucose-induced bursts of electrical activity in mouse pancreatic B-cells. The acetylcholine effects were mimicked by muscarine while nicotine had no effect on membrane potential. Pirenzepine, an antagonist of the classical M1-type muscarinic receptors, but not gallamine (1-100 microM), an antagonist of the classical M2-type receptors, antagonized the acetylcholine action on glucose-induced electrical activity (IC50 = 0.25 microM). Bethanechol, an agonist of the classical M2-type muscarinic receptors, was approximately 100 times less effective than acetylcholine in stimulating the electrical activity. In addition, acetylcholine (1 microM) induced a marked increase (25%) in input resistance to the B-cell membrane. The results indicate that acetylcholine exerted its effects on the B-cell membrane by inhibiting K+ conductance via activation of a muscarinic receptor subtype distinct from the classical M2-type receptor.", 
    "33": "Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsion were studied in control, chronic ethanol-maintained, and ethanol-withdrawal rats. The convulsive doses of PTZ varied among the different groups of rats. Ethanol-maintained rats required higher doses of PTZ to produce convulsions, compared to control and ethanol-withdrawal rats. The partially negative ligands for benzodiazepine binding sites, Ro 15-4513 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) and FG 7142 (20 mg/kg, i.p.) produced proconvulsant effect in saline (control) and ethanol-withdrawal rats as they potentiated the effect of subconvulsive dose of PTZ. A higher dose of Ro 15-4513 (4 mg/kg, i.p.), but not FG 7142 (up to 80 mg/kg, i.p.), also produced proconvulsant effect in ethanol-maintained rats. Furthermore, Ro 15-4513 (5, 10 mg/kg, i.p.), but not FG 7142 (up to 80 mg/kg, i.p.), produced clonic-tonic seizures of short duration in ethanol-withdrawal rats. These effects of Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142 were reversed by diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.), as well as by the GABA-neutral Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), thereby, indicating the involvement of central benzodiazepine receptors in the action of Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142. These observations suggest that chronic ethanol treatment selectively alters the receptor sensitivity to Ro 15-4513, an ethanol antagonist and partially negative ligand for BZ sites, and this observation supports the notion that ethanol effects are more susceptible to reversal by the imidazobenzodiazepine as compared to other negative ligand for BZ binding sites.", 
    "34": "Sixty children on long-term treatment with anticonvulsant drugs were examined for evidence of adverse reactions. The prevalence of reported side-effects was extremely low. Adverse effects on haematopoiesis were not demonstrated, and only 2 children had alanine aminotransferase levels above the reference range. Nine children had biochemical evidence of altered calcium metabolism. The findings suggest that repeated routine laboratory monitoring of asymptomatic children on long-term anticonvulsant therapy is not essential.", 
    "35": "Our understanding of drug and neurotransmitter receptors has been greatly advanced by receptor binding techniques. The theme of multiple-receptor subtypes with clinical relevance is highlighted by calcium antagonist and benzodiazepine receptors. Numerous drugs may exert therapeutic and untoward effects via calcium channels. Examples include effects of loperamide hydrochloride on diarrhea, the phenothiazine thioridazine hydrochloride on cardiac and ejaculatory function, and the neuromuscular toxicity of aminoglycosides. Elevated numbers of calcium antagonist receptors in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be involved in the pathophysiology of this disease. Benzodiazepines act via discrete central and peripheral receptors. At central receptors, benzodiazepines facilitate the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are localized to mitochondria and enriched in several endocrine glands where they are influenced by therapeutic blood levels of benzodiazepines such as diazepam.", 
    "36": "Groups of rats were given differential histories of drinking either water, cocaine (0.15 mg/ml), or ethanol (2.5%) solutions under fixed-time (FT) 1-min schedule-induced polydipsia conditions in daily, 3-hr sessions. The session solution for all groups was then changed to chlordiazepoxide (0.25 mg/ml), and after daily session intakes had stabilized, FT values of 3 and 5 min were probed for single sessions. Probe-session chlordiazepoxide intakes were greater for the Ethanol History Group than for Cocaine History and Water History Groups. Previous research showed that probe conditions elevated intakes for agents with abuse potential (cocaine, ethanol, midazolam), but not for those lacking such potential (water, chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam). The present study demonstrated that a history of ethanol overindulgence yielded elevated probe intakes for chlordiazepoxide, while a history of cocaine or water overindulgence did not. This is consistent with animal and human evidence indicating that a history of either alcohol or sedative abuse increases the probability that benzodiazepines will function as reinforcers and/or be abused.", 
    "37": "Anticonflict effects of caffeine and diazepam were investigated by two procedures in water-deprived mice; punishment procedure in which the water drinking was suppressed by an electric foot shock, and hypertonic NaCl solution procedure in which the mouse was given 2% NaCl solution in place of tap water to suppress the drinking. Single administration of caffeine (1, 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg), and combined administration of caffeine (10 mg/kg) plus diazepam (1 mg/kg) were conducted. The mouse's drinking behavior was measured for 40 min immediately after each drug administration. Diazepam 0.25 mg/kg in the punishment procedure, and caffeine 30 mg/kg and diazepam 2 mg/kg in the hypertonic NaCl solution procedure were ineffective to significantly disinhibit the suppressed drinking. However, the other doses of caffeine and diazepam significantly disinhibited the suppressed drinking in both procedures. When the combined administration of caffeine and diazepam was carried out, no enhancement of the effect was observed as compared with those of the single administration of the individual drugs. The present results suggest that caffeine possesses an anticonflict effect at certain doses, although it is pharmacologically different from benzodiazepine anxiolytics.", 
    "38": "Recent reports showed that aminophylline antagonizes the sedation caused by diazepam and narcotic agents. This study examined the antagonism of diazepam and meperidine in extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) anesthesia by low dose aminophylline. Eighty patients, aged 20-60 year-old, ASA I-II were randomly selected. No premedication was given. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with diazepam (0.2-0.5 mg/kg) and meperidine (2-5 mg/kg). The patients were divided into two groups. Group A, the control group, was given physostigmine 1 mg iv and naloxone 0.4 mg im as antagonists for diazepam and meperidine immediately after the ESWL procedure. In group B, only aminophylline 2 mg/kg iv as antagonist was given. Recovery were assessed by the \"arbitrary six point scale::and \"psychomotor performance\". There was no significant difference between the two groups for the arbitrary six point scale. However, in the psychomotor test, the aminophylline group did not completely reach the baseline value in one hour as the control group did. This implicated that patients can by physostigmine and naloxone but not by aminophylline.",

Cranial CT showed agenesis of the corpus callosum, gyral malformation, and ventricular enlargement. Similar brain abnormalities occurred in 9 of 15 previously reported patients. Including this patient, agenesis of the corpus callosum appeared in 6 of 15 patients, gyral malformation in 6 of 14, ventricular enlargement in 5 of 15, and cerebellar hypoplasia in 2 of 16. Nonketotic hyperglycinemia thus joins a growing list of inborn errors of metabolism associated with brain malformations.", 
    "41": "The water soluble benzodiazepine derivative, midazolam, is used almost exclusively at our institution to produce sedation for numerous surgical procedures. Mild arterial oxygen desaturation has been reported in patients who have received as little as .04 mg/kg. A time series design study was undertaken to determine if there was any correlation between the decline in arterial oxygen percent saturation (SaO2) and the time at which sedation occurred and to establish the presence of any statistical significance in this decline. Thirty-one ASA I and II patients consisting of 8 females and 23 males requiring various minor orthopedic and general surgical procedures were studied. The total mean age of the population was 32.29 +/- 12.43 years (mean +/- SD). Fourteen patients had a smoking history, while 15 patients did not (2 patients were eliminated from the study for failure to demonstrate sedation, as characterized by either Verrill's sign or thickened speech following intravenous administration of midazolam). All patients arrived in the operating room unpremedicated and were administered .04 mg/kg midazolam intravenously. Arterial oxygen saturation was measured over a 10-minute period using pulse oximetry. Results were analyzed using regression analysis, a t-test for independent groups, and a one-way analysis of variance. There was no statistically significant difference in the decline in SaO2 between smokers and nonsmokers. Our study has shown that the mean onset of sedation using a dose of .04 mg/kg occurred between 3 and 4 minutes, with the peak fall in SaO2 occurring at the 3-minute interval irrespective of smoking history. The greatest mean drop in SaO2 was 95.84%. Midazolam, like its parent drug, diazepam, alters ventilatory mechanics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "The glucuronide of N-1-hydroxy-ethyl flurazepam has been analysed by a direct liquid inlet liquid chromatographic/mass spectrometric system using MeOH/H2O (70:30 v/v) as mobile phase, at a flow rate of 0.7 ml min-1. Urine samples were purified by amberlite XAD-2 chromatography; the glucuronide was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography using a counterion (tetrabutyl ammonium nitrate in methanol). Chromatographic results were validated by an enzymatic method: treatment of the samples with beta-glucuronidase and extraction of the parent drug with ethyl ether at pH 9. The biological application of this method was demonstrated by determination of this glucuronide in the urine of healthy human volunteers following a single intravenous administration of 50 mg of N-1-hydroxy-ethyl flurazepam.", 
    "43": "There have been conflicting reports on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, administered i.m. The aims of this study were to determine the pharmacokinetic data of midazolam following different doses and to test whether a correlation exists between its plasma level and sedative effect. METHODS. Fifteen patients between the ages of 18 and 50 were divided into three groups for i.m. administration of midazolam 0.05 mg/kg (group 1), 0.1 mg/kg (group 2), or 0.15 mg/kg (group 3) i.m. Venous blood was drawn 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60 min, and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 h after the injection. After the same times the sedative effect was estimated by the anesthetist (awake, sleeping but easy to wake, sleeping and difficult to wake, unconscious). The plasma midazolam levels were determined by gas chromatography. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were ascertained: Cmax (peak concentration), tmax (time to attain peak concentration), clearance, elimination half-life. RESULTS. The peak concentration is directly proportional to the dosage of midazolam and the relation between the two is linear. The median Cmax values were 35.3 ng/ml (group 1), 103 ng/ml (group 2) and 123.5 ng/ml (group 3). The duration of tmax was between 12 and 36 min (means = 27 min). There was no significant difference between the groups in clearance, tmax, or elimination half-life. A significant correlation was found between the plasma midazolam levels and the degree of sedation. However, we observed a considerable variability in the effect. CONCLUSION. A 95% confidence interval for the prediction of the peak concentration of midazolam after i.m. injection is stated. Midazolam should be administered at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg at the most, if unconsciousness after premedication is to be avoided.", 
    "44": "Diazepam has been incorporated into a stable, submicronized injectable emulsion. Venous sequela induction in rabbits following iv administration of diazepam in a marketed hydroalcoholic solution and in the emulsion were determined and compared over a 5-day period. There was a marked difference in the local reactions induced by the iv administration of the marketed diazepam hydroalcoholic solution and the diazepam emulsion, even on the first postinjection day. This difference was confirmed by pathological analysis. The highest mean venous sequela score was reached by the rabbit group injected with the marketed diazepam solution. It should be noted that no statistical difference was observed between the saline and the diazepam emulsion rabbit groups during the 5 days of the observation period. The moderate increase in the venous sequela score values compared to that for the saline solution should be attributed to the intrinsic effect produced by diazepam itself, and not to the emulsion vehicle, which was shown not to induce any vascular reaction in the present study.", 
    "45": "1. The effect of muscarinic antagonists considered to be selective for M1 receptors (pirenzepine) and for M2 receptors (gallamine) were studied on bronchoconstriction and bradycardia elicited by stimulation of the vagal nerves and by i.v. acetylcholine (ACh) in anaesthetized rabbits. 2. Pirenzepine was equipotent as an antagonist of ACh-induced responses at postjunctional muscarinic receptors in the heart, lung and blood vessels, whereas gallamine was at least ten times less potent at pulmonary and vascular muscarinic receptors. Thus, gallamine never caused complete inhibition of bronchoconstrictor or hypotensive responses to i.v. ACh, whereas doses of pirenzepine in excess of 1 mumol kg-1 abolished all muscarinic responses. 3. In the lung, both antagonists inhibited bronchoconstriction caused by vagal stimulation and ACh-induced bronchoconstriction to the same extent (pirenzepine, mean ED50 65 +/- 22 and, 130 +/- 28 nmol kg-1 respectively; gallamine, ED50 greater than 10,000 nmol kg-1 for both responses). Enhancement of vagally-induced bronchoconstriction was never observed. 4. In the heart, however, both pirenzepine and gallamine were ten times less potent as antagonists of vagally-induced bradycardia than of ACh-induced bradycardia. This differential blockade was unaltered by propranolol (1 mg kg-1) pretreatment. 5. It is concluded that there is no evidence for M1 or M2 muscarinic receptors in the pulmonary innervation of the rabbit and the potency of the antagonists in abolishing in abolishing vagally-induced bronchoconstriction was consistent with blockade of M3 muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle. 6. The results suggest that M2 muscarinic receptors may exert an inhibitory effect on transmission in the parasympathetic nerves innervating the heart in the rabbit. Blockade of such neuronal receptors would increase transmitter output to the atrial cells and explain the low potency of both antagonists in abolishing vagally-induced bradycardia in the rabbit.", 
    "46": "1. The effect of pirenzepine, a muscarinic antagonist considered to be selective for M1 receptors, was studied on bronchoconstriction and bradycardia elicited by preganglionic stimulation of the parasympathetic vagal nerves and by i.v. injections of acetylcholine (ACh) in anaesthetized guinea-pigs. 2. Pirenzepine was equipotent in the heart and lung as an antagonist of the effects of i.v. ACh at postjunctional muscarinic receptors. Doses of pirenzepine in excess of 1 mumol kg-1 abolished all muscarinic responses consistent with non-selective blockade of M3 receptors on airway smooth muscle and M2 receptors on atrial cells. 3. In the lung, low doses of pirenzepine (1-100 nmol kg-1) increased vagally-induced bronchoconstriction despite concurrent partial blockade of the postjunctional receptors. This suggests blockade of neuronal muscarinic receptors. 4. Propranolol (1 mg kg-1) increased control bronchoconstrictor responses elicited by ACh and vagal stimulation but did not alter the potency of pirenzepine for postjunctional receptors in heart or lung. However, pirenzepine-induced enhancement of vagally-induced bronchoconstriction was abolished by propranolol, suggesting that pirenzepine may be an antagonist for muscarinic receptors located in the sympathetic nerves innervating airway smooth muscle. 5. These results confirm that bronchoconstrictor stimuli indirectly initiate activation of an opposing sympathetic reflex in the guinea-pig lung. This response is facilitated by muscarinic receptors located in the sympathetic nervous pathway. 6. The high potency of pirenzepine for the neuronal receptors in the sympathetic nerves suggests that these are M1 receptors. In contrast, the parasympathetic nerves innervating airway smooth muscle in this species contain M2 receptors which inhibit neurotransmission.", 
    "47": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam after IV and oral sustained-release (SR) tablet administration were evaluated in 42 healthy, normal, male volunteers. All 42 subjects received a single 1-mg intravenous (IV) alprazolam dose. After a 1-week washout period, the subjects received one of three SR treatments as a single dose: one 1-mg SR tablet, three 1-mg SR tablets, or six 1-mg SR tablets. Beginning 2 days after single-dose SR treatment, each subject received the above SR doses for 3 days. The daily dose for the multiple-dose study was the same as the subject received in the single-dose study. Serial blood samples were collected after each treatment (single-dose IV, single-dose SR, and after the last SR multiple dose), and plasma samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Sedation was assessed by a blinded observer at each blood sampling time. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for IV administration were consistent with previous results. Pharmacokinetic parameters for the SR doses were consistent with linear kinetics over the dosage range studied. The mean absolute bioavailabilities of the SR tablets were greater than 0.84 after single SR doses. Maximal sedation was related to dose after single-dose SR administration. During multiple dosing, chronic tolerance was observed. Maximal sedation scores after 3 days of alprazolam SR administration were independent of the dose administered and were lower after multiple-dose administration than scores observed after single oral SR doses, although plasma alprazolam concentrations were at least 1.5 times higher with multiple dosing. Sedation data indicate that oral SR doses were well tolerated in multiple dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "Of the soldiers deployed from the 18th Airborne Corps, Ft. Bragg, NC, on the Army's annual field exercise in the Middle East (Operation Brightstar) 68 received either placebo or 0.5 mg of triazolam once airborne on the first leg of their journey from the U.S. to the Middle East. Sleep and activity were measured during the flight by means of a wrist-worn activity monitor. Cognitive performance, mood, and sleepiness were measured 8 h after drug administration during a refueling stop in Europe. Triazolam did not increase the duration or improve the continuity of sleep during the 8-h flight from the U.S. to the refueling point. The scheduling of an inflight meal contributed to this lack of effect. There were no differences in mood or sleepiness between the two groups as assessed by the Profile of Mood States and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale. Ability to recall verbal material presented immediately prior to testing was impaired by triazolam 8 h after ingestion, as evidenced by fewer items recalled on the Logical Memory portion of the Wechsler Memory Scale. These results suggest that triazolam at a dose of 0.5 mg is unsuitable for use in long-range aerial deployments when unimpaired cognitive functioning is required immediately upon arrival.", 
    "49": "Stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) elicits phosphatidylinositol turnover, which yields inositol phosphates (InsP) and diacylglycerol (DG) the latter activating protein kinase C (PKC). Activating PKC with phorbol esters inhibits mAChR agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and InsP production. A possible mechanism of this inhibition may be down-regulation of mAChR by PKC. In the present work, rat cortical slices were preincubated with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) followed by binding assays for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB), [N-methyl-3H]scopolamine [( 3H]NMS) or [3H]pirenzepine [( 3H]PZ). Our data demonstrate that activation of PKC by phorbol esters causes a rapid down-regulation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. This down-regulation is also rapidly reversible. Receptors on the cell surface appear to be more sensitive to the effect of PKC than do internal ones. This down-regulation occurs by a decrease in the number of receptors, rather than by changes in receptor affinity. The results suggest that PKC may exert negative feedback on its own activation by down-regulating the receptors that normally elicit phosphatidylinositol turnover.", 
    "50": "We investigated whether the interoceptive discriminative stimulus (IDS) arising from ethanol withdrawal was related to decreased activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system by determining whether the sensitivity of rats to the GABA antagonists was altered by chronic treatment with ethanol. Rats were trained to obtain food reward by responding on one lever following pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and the other lever following saline. Whereas all of the trained rats selected the PTZ-appropriate lever after PTZ, no more than 50% of them selected this lever following an optimum dose of bicuculline or picrotoxinin. After either saline or diazepam (5 mg/kg), all of the rats selected the saline-appropriate lever. Ethanol (0.24 mol/kg/day) was then administered to the rats for 4 days via a nutritionally balanced liquid diet. Between 48 and 96 hours postethanol, 30% of the rats selected the PTZ-appropriate lever following saline, whereas selection of this lever was increased to 80% following either bicuculline or picrotoxinin. Thus, further antagonism of GABAergic activity increased the subjective effect of ethanol withdrawal. These data support the hypothesis that the PTZ-like IDS produced during withdrawal from ethanol is related to an ethanol-induced deficit in the activity of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-coupled chloride channel.", 
    "51": "The effects of perinatal diazepam exposure of rats on stress-induced metabolic activation of the mesotelencephalic dopamine (DA) system were examined. Footshock stress parameters were selected such that DA turnover was increased in the prefrontal cortex and certain mesolimbic dopaminergic regions; a stress-induced activation of striatum was not observed. Perinatal treatment with the anxiolytic benzodiazepine diazepam (days E8 through the first week after gestation) did not alter basal dopamine turnover in the prefrontal cortex or striatum, or in any of the mesolimbic sites examined except for the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area (in which turnover was decreased). However, perinatal exposure to diazepam significantly reduced the magnitude of the stress-elicited increase in prefrontal cortical dopamine turnover, and conversely resulted in a stress-induced enhancement of turnover in the striatum. These data suggest that although perinatal exposure to diazepam may alter basal dopaminergic function in some regions, certain enduring changes in dopamine function in other mesotelencephalic DA sites are revealed only under conditions that result in perturbation of central dopamine neurons, such as environmental stress. These data also suggest that perinatal benzodiazepine exposure may be reflected in the adult in a decreased ability to cope with stress.",

Test rats with and control rats without midazolam premedication (2.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 10% of the median dose that caused loss of the righting reflex in a third group of rats) were given 2% lidocaine with and without 10 micrograms/ml epinephrine intravenously in doses sufficient to construct log-dose response curves for both convulsant and lethal responses. In control rats the median convulsant dose (CD50) of lidocaine was 15.2 mg/kg given alone and 10.9 mg/kg with epinephrine (a statistically significant difference); respective values for the median lethal dose (LD50) were 26.4 and 18.5 mg/kg (also statistically significant). While epinephrine enhanced lidocaine seizure activity and lethality by approximately 50%, midazolam almost completely prevented lidocaine-induced convulsions but had no significant effect on mortality.",

Scatchard analysis indicated a single class of high affinity (Kd = 2.3 nM) binding sites. The binding of [3H]L-365,260 was stereospecific, because unlabeled L-365,260 (an R-enantiomer) was approximately 100 times more potent than its S-enantiomer in displacing binding. The relative potencies of various CCK/gastrin-related peptides and nonpeptide peripheral CCK-A antagonists in displacing [3H]L-365,260 brain binding correlated with their potencies in displacing the binding of 125I-CCK to brain receptors but not their potencies in displacing the peripherally selective CCK-A ligand [3H]L-364,718 from pancreatic receptors. The regional distribution of [3H]L-365,260 binding in various brain areas correlated with 125I-CCK binding. Specific [3H]L-365,260 binding to guinea pig brain membranes was reduced by omission of NaCl but was not affected by omission of MgCl2 or addition of guanosine 5'-(beta-gamma-imido)triphosphate or various pharmacological agents known to interact with other common peptide and nonpeptide receptor systems. [3H]L-365,260 also bound in a specific manner to guinea pig gastric glands but only negligibly to guinea pig or rat pancreas. The binding of [3H]L-365,260 to gastric glands was inhibited by CCK/gastrin antagonists with potencies similar to those for inhibition of 125I-gastrin binding in this tissue. Collectively, the data indicates that [3H]L-365,260 represents a new potent nonpeptide antagonist radioligand suitable for the study of brain CCK-B and gastrin receptors.", 
    "55": "We report the cases of 3 patients with medically intractable seizures in whom withdrawal of treatment with a long-acting benzodiazepine (clorazepate dipotassium, 2 patients; clonazepam, 1 patient) was followed by delirium with catatoniclike features. While an increase in seizure frequency occurred during withdrawal and prior to the onset of behavioral changes, electroencephalograms did not show epileptiform activity during the delirium. We compared these 3 patients with 10 others with intractable seizures in whom antiepileptic therapy was withdrawn without subsequent behavior changes. High-dose benzodiazepine therapy and a history of viral encephalitis may be risk factors for withdrawal delirium.",

With diazepam pretreatment there was clear improvement in the quality of lumbar and neck recordings--increased reproducibility and definition and ease of measurement--and also greater tolerance of the procedure and a slight shortening of time required for the test.", 
    "57": "The binding of selective muscarinic receptor antagonists to regions of rat brain was examined through quantitative autoradiographic techniques. 5,11-Dihydro-11-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)acetyl]-6H- pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one [pirenzepine (compound I)] and 11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one [AF-DX 116 (compound II)] were chosen on the basis of their selectivity for M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors, respectively, and similarities in chemical structure. Pirenzepine displayed a higher potency than II for inhibition of [3H]-l-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]-l-QNB) binding to rat brain sections. Scatchard analyses of binding to brain sections revealed heterogeneous binding profiles for both antagonists, suggesting the presence of multiple receptor binding sites. Quantitative autoradiographic techniques were utilized in regional analyses of antagonist binding. Pirenzepine displayed the highest affinity for hippocampal, striatal, and amygdaloid muscarinic receptors (IC50 values less than 0.4 microM), with a slightly lower affinity for cortical receptors (IC50 values between 0.4 and 0.8 microM). Pirenzepine displayed the lowest affinity for thalamic and brainstem regions with IC50 values generally greater than 1.0 microM. In contrast, II bound with higher affinity to muscarinic receptors in brainstem, cerebellar, and hypothalamic nuclei (IC50 values less than 0.5 microM) than to receptors in thalamic nuclei (IC50 values between 0.5 and 2.0 microM). Binding sites with the lowest affinity for II were found in cortical, striatal, and hippocampal regions (IC50 values greater than 2.0 microM). The binding profiles of the two selective muscarinic antagonists reveal the complexity and diversity of muscarinic receptor subtypes throughout the brain. The data provide a basis for identifying muscarinic receptor subtypes (as defined through cloning procedures) with selective ligands. Minimum-energy conformations of pirenzepine and II were calculated by using the program MacroModel (version 2.0). Pirenzepine displayed three energy minima, differing in the relative position of the piperazine ring with respect to the tricyclic system. In contrast, the (diethylamino)methyl substituent on the piperidine ring conferred a much larger set of minimum-energy conformations on II. It is suggested that the greater conformational flexibility of the side chain allows II to achieve a conformation inaccessible to pirenzepine, which allows it to bind preferentially to M2 receptors.", 
    "58": "A series of 1-(2-amino-1-phenylethyl)-6-phenyl-4H- [1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepines was prepared and evaluated for diuretic activity. These compounds have diuretic and natriuretic activity but no kaliuretic activity when evaluated by oral administration to the conscious rat. The structure requirements for this activity are discussed. In particular it was found that the 2-aminoethyl side chain at C-1 with hydrogen or methyl substituents on the amino group was required for diuretic activity. A substituent at C-8 was also required; soft substituents such as methylthio and iodo at this position favored activity. Compounds with both phenyl and 2-pyridyl substituents at C-6 were active; substituents on the C-6 phenyl, however, reduced or eliminated the activity. Substituents other than phenyl at the 1-position of the 2-aminoethyl side chain were detrimental to activity; phenyl substitution at this position was required for activity when the substituent at C-8 was chloro but not when it was bromo.",

Of all detergents tested [digitonin, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate (CHAPS), Tween 20, deoxycholate, and Triton X-100] in the presence of NaCl, the best solubilization (15% of initial activity) was obtained using 0.5% of the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS plus 2 M NaCl. Specific binding of [3H]PK 11195 to membrane-bound and solubilized PBS was saturable, yielding equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of 1.3 +/- 0.2 and 1.9 +/- 0.3 nM, respectively, and maximal numbers of binding sites of 1,435 +/- 150 and 980 +/- 126 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The KD value of PK 11195 binding to solubilized PBS obtained from experimental kinetic analysis was 0.95 +/- 0.09 nM. The relative potencies of various compounds (PK 11195, Ro 5-4864, diazepam, flunitrazepam, clonazepam, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, and Ro 15-1788) in displacing [3H]PK 11195 specific binding from membrane-bound and solubilized PBS were similar. Most of the solubilized binding activity was destroyed by heating at 60 degrees C for 30 min or by treatment with 2 M guanidinium chloride, which indicates the presence of a protein-binding site in the solubilized preparation. Over 85% of the solubilized binding activity was retained after 1 week at 4 degrees C, which will enable future application of purification procedures without major concern for stability of the material.",

    "61": "Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) is released after ingestion of protein-fat meals and following administration of some gut hormones (CCK and bombesin), but the hormonal contribution to the physiological release of PP has not been elucidated. We used specific and potent CCK-receptor antagonist, L-364,718, administered intravenously in a dose of 0.5 mumol/kg or intraduodenally in a dose of 2 mumol/kg to assess the role of CCK in the release of PP. Exogenous CCK-8 infused intravenously in gradually increasing doses (12.5-400 pmol/kg/hr) caused a dose-dependent increase in plasma PP from basal 28 +/- 4 pM to 136 +/- 18 pM, and this PP increase was completely suppressed by both intravenous and intraduodenal administration of L-364,718. Meat feeding caused a dramatic increase in plasma PP from a basal level of 26 +/- 4 pM to a peak of about 190 +/- 32 pM, and the pretreatment with intravenous or intraduodenal L-364,718 reduced this PP increase by about 60%. Duodenal perfusion with oleate (0.12-4.0 mmol/hr) or L-Trp (0.12-4.0 mmol/hr) also increased plasma PP, reaching, respectively, 180 +/- 28 pM and 76 +/- 6 pM. Pretreatment with intravenous or intraduodenal L-364,718 completely abolished the plasma PP responses to oleate and L-Trp. Bombesin (100 pmol/kg/hr) raised plasma PP to the level similar to that achieved by meat feeding and L-364,718 given intravenously or intraduodenally blocked completely these plasma PP increments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "62": "Stiff-man syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by intermittent spasms and stiffness of the axial muscles, is associated with an electromyographic pattern of continuous motor unit activity in affected muscles. Since the initial description in 1956, the stiff-man syndrome has been reported to occur in various clinical and neurologic settings. In this study, we reviewed the current state of knowledge about this syndrome, defined diagnostic criteria, provided a long-term follow-up of the disorder, and assessed rehabilitative attempts in affected patients. Use of rigorous criteria that identify patients who have the stiff-man syndrome is important because the initial clinical manifestations are similar to those of other neuromuscular diseases. Analysis of 13 patients with stiff-man syndrome examined at the Mayo Clinic during the past 30 years revealed that treatment with diazepam decreased the muscle spasms. Because some muscle spasms usually persist, rehabilitation is an important adjunct that may further improve function when it is centered on the treatment of low-back pain and hyperlordosis, mobility problems, gait abnormalities, and muscular stiffness.", 
    "63": "We studied three groups of 30 patients each, undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery, anaesthetized with alfentanil (30 micrograms/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 0.3 micrograms/kg/min), thiopental 3 mg/kg and 70% N2O via facial mask. Patients in group I were treated, three minutes before induction, with vecuronium 0.02 mg/kg i.v., while those in group II were premedicated with diazepam 0.15 mg/kg i.m. 30-45 minutes before induction. Group III served as control. Muscular rigidity was evaluated clinically with a subjective score based on a scale of 0 (no rigidity) to 3 (severe rigidity). Diazepam did not give significant protection from muscular rigidity. Vecuronium administration did not significantly reduced the number of patients who became rigid, but significantly decreased the incidence of severe rigidity (p less than 0.005), the mean rigidity score (p less than 0.05) and the incidence of rigidity at the induction of anaesthesia (p less than 0.0005). We also observed a progressively increasing incidence of rigidity with increasing age (not significantly) and body weight (p less than 0.05 total rigidity, p less than 0.01 severe rigidity).", 
    "64": "Frequencies of abuse and dependence assessed continuously within a drug surveillance system were analysed as a contribution to risk-benefit evaluations of benzodiazepines (BZDs). In 4.7% of 15,296 patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals between 1980 and 1985, BZDs had been involved in some kind of abuse or dependence. Primary BZD dependence, defined as physical dependence on BZDs in patients who had not been dependent before, was observed in about 1% of admitted patients. Linking these data with psychiatric diagnoses revealed a high risk of primary BZD dependence for in-patients (11.8%) with anxiety neurosis (ICD-9, 300.0), and a lower risk for neurotic (300.4) and for endogenous depressives (296.1) (risk 3.7% and 2.7% respectively). Older age was also related to primary BZD dependence. For depressive in-patients, the risk was twice as high in females as in males. Anecdotal observations advocate more systematic investigation of the emotional effects of long-term therapy with BZDs.", 
    "65": "The potent imidazopyridine hypnotic, zolpidem, binds to central benzodiazepine receptors and has predominantly sedative properties, as determine in animal models. In tests of palatable food consumption in nondeprived male rats, the present results indicate that zolpidem (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) had no effect on food intake. Its lack of effect contrasts sharply with other benzodiazepine agonists which strongly stimulate palatable food intake. Two other novel compounds, both of which bind to benzodiazepine receptors, and which have reduced propensity to induce sedative effects, increased palatable food consumption, although in differing ways. The imidazobenzodiazepine Ro23-0364 (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased feeding in the standard procedure, but failed to stimulate food intake in presatiated animals. The pyrazoloquinoline CGS 17867A (1.0-30.0 mg/kg) increased food intake in both test procedures, although the dose-effect relationship was nonmonotonic. Taken together, the data indicate a probable separation between hyperphagic and sedating effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists. If zolpidem's sedative effect is linked to an action at a receptor subtype (benzodiazepine Type 1 or omega 1), then the hyperphagic effect of benzodiazepines may depend more on the alternative subtype.", 
    "66": "The influence of nootropic drugs of different chemical structure and mechanism of action (piracetam 200-800 mg/kg, meclofenoxate 50-100 mg/kg, nicergoline 1-4 mg/kg) on amnestic disturbances induced with electroconvulsive shock (ECS), scopolamine (2.5 mg/kg) and phenazepam (2.0 mg/kg) was studied in mice using passive avoidance test. All the investigated drugs possess distinct protective properties concerning different models of amnesia. In ECS-induced amnesia meclofenoxate was most effective, in scopolamine-induced amnesia--meclofenoxate and nicergoline, in phenazepam-induced amnesia all drugs were equally potent in profundity. It is supposed that neurophysiological mechanism of action of nootropic drugs is connected with directed activation of weakened memory trace of different etiology and its transmission into form receivable for transcription.", 
    "67": "The use of seclusion within a psychiatric intensive care unit in a South Australian metropolitan mental hospital was documented over a ten week period. The seclusion rate within the unit was 32% of all admissions and 34% of new admissions. The overall seclusion rate for the hospital was 5.4% of all admissions and 6.3% of new admissions, somewhat higher than in the United Kingdom but considerably lower than in the Eastern United States. A comparison was then made between consecutive new admissions (30 secluded and 30 non-secluded) to this unit and to a similar unit without a seclusion room in the other mental hospital in the State. Although seclusion offered no clear advantages in terms of duration of admission, levels of medication or relapse rates, it appeared to reduce the level of dangerousness in the unit, thereby enhancing staff morale. The overall mean daily total of neuroleptic medication was about 1,200 mg chlorpromazine equivalent, somewhat less than in comparable units in the United States and Europe.", 
    "68": "Anxiety and depression are commonly occurring symptoms. Anxiety disorders and mood disorders usually share common symptoms and they frequently co-exist. There is a considerable body of research that has demonstrated that anxiety and depression can be distinguished from each other at the syndrome level. There is also evidence that such a distinction is arbitrary and not well substantiated. Clinically, the practitioner is often faced with the problem of treating a patient who presents with anxiety and depressive symptoms at the same time. It is well-established that the first line of treatment in major mood disorder is the used of tricyclic antidepressant in adequate dosage. The first line of treatment for the anxiety disorders is usually the administration of benzodiazepine anxiolytics. The anti-depressants have to be given for some months to the majority of patients whereas the anxiolytics are given for short periods. The tricyclics have a relatively slow onset of action compared to the benzodiazepines. Recent evidence is available about the effectiveness of the triazolo-benzodiazepines in panic disorder with or without secondary major mood disorder. There are also reports of the effects of the triazolo-benzodiazepines in primary mood disorder. In these mood disorders, the benzodiazepines caused rapid relief of both anxious and depressive symptomatology. The effects of the benzodiazepines occur even in the presence of melancholic depression. Where anxiety and depression coexist, the clinician may wish to consider beginning anti-depressant therapy with combined tricyclic antidepressant and benzodiazepine to produce rapid symptom relief. After four weeks the benzodiazepine should be faded out and therapy continued with the tricyclic medication alone.", 
    "69": "This report surveyed the pharmacologic knowledge of the physician housestaff and intensive care nurses regarding the analgesic and anxiolytic effects of narcotics, benzodiazepines and neuromuscular blockers. The results demonstrated a commonly held misconception that muscular paralysis is a calm and painless state. The authors instituted an educational program stressing the need for analgesic and anxiolytic medications in conjunction with paralytic agents.", 
    "70": "Modulation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a well-established effect of many centrally acting drugs. However, there is uncertainty concerning the nature of the changes and their significance, and it is in this context that we have analyzed the effects of several groups of drugs that alter monoaminergic or purinergic transmission on sleep in humans. The analysis shows that drugs that modulate noradrenergic and serotonergic transmission lead to marked suppression of REM sleep, irrespective of any increase or decrease in sleep duration. There is no evidence that the timing of the ultradian cycle of REM sleep relative to sleep onset is altered by these drugs. On the other hand, reduced REM sleep with dopamimetic drugs is due solely to increased wakefulness. However, there can be more subtle effects of some drugs on REM sleep. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists and drugs that modify purinergic transmission modulate the appearance of early REM activity. There may, therefore, be two discrete systems that control entry into REM sleep, and that are responsive to drugs. The exact appearance and timing of REM periods may be modulated by a feedback mechanism involving GABAergic, or possibly purinergic, transmission, while monoaminergic and cholinergic influences exert a reciprocal and overriding control of REM sleep.", 
    "71": "Rebound insomnia, a worsening of sleep compared with pretreatment levels, has been reported upon discontinuation of short half-life benzodiazepine hypnotics. This paper reviews the existing sleep laboratory studies for the presence or absence of rebound insomnia following treatment with triazolam, temazepam, and flurazepam in insomniac patients or poor sleepers and, when possible, in normals. The results indicate that rebound insomnia is a distinct possibility after discontinuation of triazolam in both insomniacs and normal controls. Compared with baseline, disturbed sleep was reported in insomniacs or poor sleepers for the first 1 or 2 nights of withdrawal in seven of nine polygraphically recorded sleep studies following triazolam 0.5 mg and in one of two studies following triazolam 0.25 mg. In one study conducted in normal volunteers, rebound insomnia was observed following triazolam 0.5 mg but not triazolam 0.25 mg. In another study, which used subjective reports of sleep rather than polygraphic recordings, rebound insomnia was significantly attenuated after triazolam 0.5 mg by tapering the dose over 4 nights. The risk of rebound insomnia after temazepam 15 or 30 mg was low. In keeping with its long elimination half-life, flurazepam (30 mg) continued to exert beneficial effects for the first 2-3 withdrawal nights, but the possibility of a mild rebound insomnia cannot be dismissed during the intermediate withdrawal period (nights 4-10) following prolonged, consecutive, nightly administration (more than 30 nights). The benzodiazepine hypnotics are generally preferred over other types (barbiturates or nonbenzodiazepine, nonbarbiturate), but there are advantages and disadvantages related to half-life of the benzodiazepines. The risk of rebound insomnia is greater with the short half-life as compared with the long half-life benzodiazepines."
