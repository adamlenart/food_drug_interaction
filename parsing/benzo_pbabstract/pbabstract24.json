Despite this time-consuming and costly process, not all patients show an adequate response to treatment. As a consequence, relapse is a common occurrence and early intervention is hampered. Here, we have attempted to identify candidate blood biomarkers associated with drug response in 121 initially antipsychotic-free recent-onset schizophrenia patients treated with widely-used antipsychotics, namely olanzapine (n=40), quetiapine (n=23), risperidone (n=30) and a mixture of these drugs (n=28). Patients were recruited and investigated as two separate cohorts to allow biomarker validation. Data analysis showed the most significant relationship between pre-treatment levels of heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) and response to olanzapine (p=0.008, F=8.6, \u03b2=70.4 in the discovery cohort and p=0.003, F=15.2, \u03b2=24.4 in the validation cohort, adjusted for relevant confounding variables). In a functional follow-up analysis of this finding, we tested an independent cohort of 10 patients treated with olanzapine and found that baseline levels of plasma H-FABP and expression of the binding partner for H-FABP, fatty acid translocase (CD36), on monocytes predicted the reduction of psychotic symptoms (p=0.040, F=6.0, \u03b2=116.3 and p=0.012, F=11.9, \u03b2=-0.0054, respectively). We also identified a set of serum molecules changed after treatment with antipsychotic medication, in particular olanzapine. These molecules are predominantly involved in cellular development and metabolism. Taken together, our findings suggest an association between biomarkers involved in fatty acid metabolism and response to olanzapine, while other proteins may serve as surrogate markers associated with drug efficacy and side effects.", 
    "1": "Bone marrow examination plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of various hematological and systemic diseases. Even though the procedure has been carried out for decades, it remains an extremely painful and uncomfortable experience for a majority of patients. This paper reviews the different strategies used to provide analgesia and summarizes the advantages and drawbacks of one strategy over the other. A literature review was carried out addressing the different approaches to providing pain relief during bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Several different methods, procedure modifications and protocols are employed at various centers but pain control and analgesia remain incomplete. Local infiltration with lidocaine or similar local analgesics is the standard at most centers. Although there is limited data, there are several studies in literature demonstrating the pain relieving effects of different methods and drugs when used with local anesthetics. Sedation, usually using benzodiazepines, reduces anticipatory anxiety, provides analgesia and also short term amnesia. Combinations of different agents not only yield potent effects but also reduce the required dose of each individual drug, minimizing adverse effects. Non-pharmacological factors also play key roles. Providing patients with complete and comprehensible information is vital to ensure the least amount of discomfort during the biopsy. Distraction techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis and music therapy, may also play a role in minimizing pain.", 
    "2": "Drug users often combine benzodiazepines with psychostimulants, such as methamphetamine. However, very little research has been conducted on this type of polydrug use, particularly in female subjects. The present study was therefore designed to examine the effects of two benzodiazepines, alprazolam and oxazepam, on the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine and cocaine in both male and female rats. Rats were trained to discriminate methamphetamine (1.0\u00a0mg/kg, ip) or cocaine (10\u00a0mg/kg, ip) from saline using a two-lever operant, food-reinforced, drug discrimination design. Pretreatment with oxazepam (5, 10 and 20\u00a0mg/kg, ip) significantly attenuated methamphetamine discrimination in both male and female rats. In contrast, however, the high dose of alprazolam (4\u00a0mg/kg, ip) actually augmented the subjective effects of lower doses of methamphetamine (0.125 and 0.25\u00a0mg/kg, ip). Oxazepam produced similar effects on the subjective effects of cocaine as with methamphetamine, significantly reducing cocaine discrimination in both male and female rats. However, neither the high nor low dose of alprazolam (2 and 4\u00a0mg/kg, ip) produced any apparent effect on cocaine discrimination. Finally, while similar results were observed in both male and female rats across these experiments, methamphetamine and cocaine discrimination were more sensitive to oxazepam in female subjects. The results of these experiments suggest that alprazolam and oxazepam can differentially affect the subjective effects of methamphetamine and cocaine. These results also demonstrate that alprazolam can differentially affect the discriminative stimulus effects of methamphetamine and cocaine.",

Discrepancies were more common among clients with better functioning and ability to self-manage drug use. Agreement between in-home interview data and EMRs was very good or good for other drug groups, but moderate for opioids, paracetamol, benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related drugs and lubricant eye drops, and poor for selective beta-2-adrenoceptor agonists.

    "8": "Parental microglial induced neuroinflammation, triggered by bacterial- or viral infections, can induce neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism to offspring in animal models. Recent investigations suggest that microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, provides a link between neurotransmission, immune cell activation, brain inflammation and neuronal dysfunction seen with the offspring. Relatively little is known about how reduction of brain inflammation and restoration of glial function are associated with diminution of brain degeneration and behavioral deficits in offspring. Increased mGluR5 expression and the long-lasting excitotoxic effects of the neurotoxin during brain development are associated with the glial dysfunctions. We investigated the relationship of mGluR5 and PBR and how they regulate glial function and inflammatory processes in mice prenatally exposed to LPS (120\u03bcg/kg, between gestational days 15 and 17), an inflammatory model of a psychiatric disorder. Using PET imaging, we showed that pharmacological activation of mGluR5 during 5 weeks reduced expression of classic inflammation marker PBR in many brain areas and that this molecular association was not present in LPS-exposed offspring. The post-mortem analysis revealed that the down regulation of PBR was mediated through activation of mGluR5 in astrocytes. In addition, we demonstrated that this interaction is defective in a mouse model of the psychiatric deficit offering a novel insight of mGluR5 involvement to brain related disorders and PBR related imaging studies. In conclusion, mGluR5 driven glutamatergic activity regulates astrocytic functions associated with PBR (cholesterol transport, neurosteroidogenesis, glial phenotype) during maturation and could be associated with neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring.", 
    "9": "Drug testing is an important clinical tool that is available to physicians who are assessing the effectiveness of drug treatment as well as patient compliance to the administered program. While urine has traditionally been the matrix of choice for drug monitoring, oral fluid, a filtrate of the blood, has shown great promise as an alternative matrix for such applications. Oral fluid collection can be accomplished without the need for highly trained medical staff through the use of a simple, noninvasive oral fluid collection device, which obtains an adequate sample in only a few minutes. There has been a significant amount of research performed on the use of oral fluid for forensic toxicology application; however, more studies assessing the use of oral fluid drug testing are required to validate its ability to achieve clinical drug monitoring goals. Testing for various drugs in oral fluid may yield a different result when compared to the same drugs in urine, requiring an assessment of the utility of oral fluid for such practices. The purpose of this study was to examine the application of oral fluid drug testing in patients undergoing buprenorphine treatment for opioid dependence. A retrospective analysis of drug testing results obtained from 6,928 patients (4,560 unobserved urine collections and 2,368 observed oral fluid collections) monitored for heroin metabolite, amphetamine, benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine, codeine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, methadone, morphine, oxycodone, and oxymorphone was completed. Results of this statistical exercise indicated that patients undergoing observed oral fluid collection tested positive more frequently than those unobserved urine collections for several illicit drugs and prescription medications targeted. Oral fluid was shown to detect illicit drug use as well as noncompliance in this patient population under the studied conditions more often than the urine specimens.",

To investigate the mechanisms by which SMO overexpression leads to increased susceptibility to kainate excitotoxicity and seizure, in the cerebral cortex of Dach-SMO and control mice we assessed markers for astrocyte proliferation and neuron loss, and the ability of kainate to evoke glutamate release from nerve terminals and astrocyte processes. Moreover, we assessed a possible role of astrocytes in an in vitro model of epileptic-like activity in combined cortico-hippocampal slices recorded with a multi-electrode array device. In parallel, as the brain is a major metabolizer of oxygen and yet has relatively feeble protective antioxidant mechanisms, we analyzed the oxidative status of the cerebral cortex of both SMO-overexpressing and control mice by evaluating enzymatic and non-enzymatic scavengers such as metallothioneins. The main findings in the cerebral cortex of Dach-SMO mice as compared to controls are the following: astrocyte activation and neuron loss; increased oxidative stress and activation of defense mechanisms involving both neurons and astrocytes; increased susceptibility to kainate-evoked cortical epileptogenic activity, dependent on astrocyte function; appearance of a glutamate-releasing response to kainate from astrocyte processes due to activation of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors in Dach-SMO mice. We conclude that reactive astrocytosis and activation of glutamate release from astrocyte processes might contribute, together with increased reactive oxygen species production, to the vulnerability to kainate excitotoxicity in Dach-SMO mice. This mouse model with a deregulated polyamine metabolism would shed light on roles for astrocytes in increasing vulnerability to excitotoxic neuron injury.",

The majority of patients (within the range of 75%-79%) were dispensed at least one psychotropic medication. At the beginning of the study period atypical antipsychotics (38%) were the most frequently dispensed psychotropic, followed by benzodiazepines (28%), non-sedative antidepressants (27%), sedative antidepressants (17%), anti-epileptics (7%), and conventional antipsychotics (3%). Dispensing of anti-epileptics (2% increase) and conventional antipsychotics (1% decrease) displayed modest changes over time, but we observed more pronounced changes in dispensing of benzodiazepines (11% decrease) and atypical antipsychotics (4% decrease). Concurrently, we observed a substantial growth in the dispensing of both sedative (15% increase) and non-sedative (9% increase) antidepressants.

BTBR T (+) Itpr3 (tf) /J (BTBR), an inbred mouse strain, displays social deficits and repetitive self-grooming, offering face validity to ASD diagnostic symptoms. Reduced GABAergic neurotransmission in BTBR suggests that GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) could improve ASD-relevant BTBR phenotypes. The neuroactive steroid ganaxolone acts as a PAM, displaying anticonvulsant properties in rodent epilepsy models and an anxiolytic-like profile in the elevated plus-maze.",

However, ten years have already passed since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) were approved for the treatment of SAD in Japan, and not only laypersons but also mental health professionals still misunderstand SAD as public speech phobia. As a result, the boundary between normal shyness and SAD and threshold to start pharmacotherapy have been debated. Participants in most double-blind studies of SSRI were limited to those with a generalized subtype of SAD. While benzodiazepine led to a significantly more favorable response and symptom improvement and the effect size of benzodiazepine was larger than those of SSRI, it did not lead to a \"cure\" and is sometimes deleterious for atypical SAD patients. To sum up, a psychotherapeutic approach including cognitive behavioral therapy is suggested as first-line treatment for non-generalized SAD according to the NICE guidelines. On the other hand, patients with generalized SAD and secondary depression are still misunderstood (and under-recognized) as those with \"treatment-resistant depression\", and they suffer from severe impairment of the psycho-social function, including absences or withdrawal from working or schooling. They need more effective combination treatment of SSRI and cognitive behavioral therapy as generalized SAD patients.",

ABH gel includes haloperidol as well as diphenhydramine and lorazepam. The gel was not significantly better than placebo in this small study; however haloperidol is reported not to be absorbed significantly when applied topically, therefore the trial does not address the issue of whether haloperidol is effective or well-tolerated when administered by other routes (e.g. by mouth, subcutaneously or intravenously). We identified one ongoing trial of haloperidol for the management of nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer, with initial results published in a conference abstract suggesting that haloperidol is effective for 65% of patients.

Factors such as a lack of knowledge or recognition of the common structure specific pain referral patterns, poor clinical reasoning, inappropriate referral and predilection for popular management approaches also contribute to mis-diagnosis and mis-management. This report describes two cases of chronic low back pain with lengthy histories of multiple failed interventions to highlight the consequences of focussing on a singular approach to the exclusion of evidence based pathways and the resulting risk of a missed diagnosis.

Identifying the benefit of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists has shifted toward methods to improve benzodiazepine (BZD) utilization. Literature validating this treatment approach in severe withdrawal, especially in the critical care setting, is limited, and extrapolation to this population may be dangerous. Multiple therapies have been suggested or utilized in the literature including continuous infusion of GABA agonists, ethanol, dexmedetomidine, antiepileptics, and antipsychotics, introducing a significant amount of variability into clinical practice. This variability in treatment approaches highlights the lack of uniformity and recommendations available for the treatment of severe refractory patients. In patients progressing to severe withdrawal, it may be warranted to escalate care with adjunctive or more aggressive therapies. Although multiple practices are commonly used, the evidence supporting their use after failing symptom-triggered or aggressive therapy with BZDs is virtually nonexistent. These patients commonly receive a multimodal approach, which varies substantially between providers and institutions. Further literature should be directed at the approach most likely to provide benefit when standard of care has failed.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the Immunalysis\u00ae Benzodiazepines ELISA kit could detect phenazepam, etizolam, pyrazolam, flubromazepam, diclazepam and its metabolite delorazepam. Their cross-reactivity was assessed by comparing the absorbance of the drug with that of oxazepam, the reference standard. This study found that these uncontrolled benzodiazepines cross-react sufficiently to produce a positive result with the Immunalysis\u00ae Benzodiazepine ELISA kit. Cross-reactivity ranged from 79 to 107% for phenazepam, etizolam, pyrazolam, flubromazepam, diclazepam and delorazepam fortified into blood.

Rivastigmine enhanced the effect of the mACh receptor agonist N-desmethylclozapine on prefrontal dopamine release, a marker of mACh receptor function, and this increase was blocked by telenzepine. In contrast, galantamine did not affect N-desmethylclozapine-induced dopamine release. Furthermore, rivastigmine did not affect cortical dopamine release induced by the serotonin1A receptor agonist osemozotan, suggesting that the effect of rivastigmine has specificity for mACh receptors.", 
    "50": "Taken together with our previous finding that marked increases in ACh levels are required for the PPI deficit improvement induced by galantamine, our present results suggest that rivastigmine improves isolation rearing-induced PPI deficits by increasing ACh levels and by concomitantly enhancing mACh receptor function.",

Olanzapine pamoate monohydrate was administered once every 14 days by intramuscular injection for 3 months to fed male dogs (n=15) at a dose of 20 mg/kg olanzapine (equivalent to 46 mg/kg olanzapine pamoate monohydrate). Blood samples were collected after the fifth (Day 57) and sixth (Day 71) doses to determine olanzapine and N-oxide olanzapine concentrations. On Day 71 at 72 h postdose, dogs were euthanized and placed on their backs without additional manipulation and held for postmortem blood, urine, and tissue collection at room temperature for up to 168 h postdose (96 h after euthanasia). Concentrations of olanzapine and N-oxide olanzapine were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy/mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). Postmortem olanzapine concentrations in blood increased up to seven-fold compared to the last quantified antemortem blood concentration. Olanzapine concentrations in vein tissue samples (surrogates for peripheral blood) also increased, whereas other tissue concentrations, such as myocardium, lung, liver, and kidney decreased over the postmortem period. An increase in blood concentration of olanzapine after death was observed in all but one animal, suggesting that postmortem redistribution may occur in dogs following biweekly intramuscular administration of olanzapine pamoate monohydrate. The rise in olanzapine concentrations in blood after death in this study may potentially be attributed to diffusion from multiple tissues to blood and, to a lesser extent, reduction of the N-oxide olanzapine metabolite back to olanzapine. However, the generalizability of these results to humans cannot be confirmed by the present study.",

Risk factors for falls include the use of psychotropic drugs, which are used for the treatment of PD neuropsychiatric symptoms. We aimed to determine the association between psychotropic drug use and falls in a PD cohort. A cross-sectional study from the NPF QII study UF site was conducted. Subjects reported presence and frequency of falls in the prior year. Frequency was scored from 0 (no falls) to 4 (falling daily). Antidepressants, antipsychotics, cognitive enhancers/stimulants, and benzodiazepines were considered psychotropics. Forty percent of the 647 subjects included had a fall in the previous year. Fallers were found to have clinical signs of a more advanced disease. After adjusting for confounding variables, the regression analysis showed that use of antidepressants alone (adjusted OR 2.2, CI 95 % 1.3-3.8, p = 0.04), benzodiazepines alone (adjusted OR 2.0, CI 95 % 1.1-3.5, p = 0.02), and the combination of antidepressants with benzodiazepines (adjusted OR 4.1, CI 95 % 2.0-8.3, p < 0.0001) were independently associated with the presence of falls. When comparing to those not on psychotropics, subjects on antidepressants alone had a significantly higher mean frequency of falls score (1.07 vs. 0.44, p < 0.0001). The use of antidepressants was independently associated with falls in our PD cohort after considering for confounding variables such as age and measures of disease progression. Other factors related to disease progression should be considered before claiming the use of psychotropic drugs as causative.",

Studies have shown that patients who engage in doctor shopping find it fun, exciting, and easy to do. There is a lack of research on the prescriber's perspective on the phenomenon of doctor shopping. This study investigates the experiences of prescribers in psychiatry with patients who engage in doctor shopping. Fifteen prescribers including psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners working in outpatient psychiatry were interviewed to elicit detailed information about their experiences with patients who engage in doctor shopping. Themes found throughout the interview were that psychiatric prescribers' experience with patients who engage in doctor shopping includes (a) detecting red flags, (b) negative emotional responding, (c) addressing the patient and the problem, and (d) inconsistently implementing precautions. When red flags were detected when prescribing controlled drugs, prescribers in psychiatry experienced both their own negative emotional responses such as disappointment and resentment as well as the negative emotions of the patients such as anger and other extreme emotional responses. Psychiatric prescribers responded to patient's doctor shopping in a variety of ways such as changing their practice, discharging the patients or taking steps to not accept certain patients identified as being at risk for doctor shopping, as well as by talking to the patient and trying to offer them help. Despite experiencing doctor shopping, the prescribers inconsistently implemented precautionary measures such as checking prescription drug monitoring programs.", 
    "79": "Stimulation of the cortical muscarinic M1 receptor (CHRM1) is proposed as a treatment for schizophrenia, a hypothesis testable using CHRM1 allosteric modulators. Allosteric modulators have been shown to change the activity of CHRMs using cloned human CHRMs and CHRM knockout mice but not human CNS, a prerequisite for them working in humans. Here we show in vitro that BQCA, a positive allosteric CHRM1 modulator, brings about the expected change in affinity of the CHRM1 orthosteric site for acetylcholine in human cortex. Moreover, this effect of BQCA is reduced in the cortex of a subset of subjects with schizophrenia, separated into a discrete population because of a profound loss of cortical [(3)H]pirenzepine binding. Surprisingly, there was no change in [(3)H]NMS binding to the cortex from this subset or those with schizophrenia but without a marked loss of cortical CHRM1. Hence, we explored the nature of [(3)H]pirenzepine and [(3)H]NMS binding to human cortex and showed total [(3)H]pirenzepine and [(3)H]NMS binding was reduced by Zn(2+), acetylcholine displacement of [(3)H]NMS binding was enhanced by Mg(2+) and Zn(2+), acetylcholine displacement of [(3)H]pirenzepine was reduced by Mg(2+) and enhanced by Zn(2+), whereas BQCA effects on [(3)H]NMS, but not [(3)H]pirenzepine, binding was enhanced by Mg(2+) and Zn(2+). These data suggest the orthosteric and allosteric sites on CHRMs respond differently to divalent cations and the effects of allosteric modulation of the cortical CHRM1 is reduced in a subset of people with schizophrenia, a finding that may have ramifications for the use of CHRM1 allosteric modulators in the treatment of schizophrenia.",

Here we report that social contact increases, whereas isolation decreases, the mobilization of the endogenous marijuana-like neurotransmitter, anandamide, in the mouse nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain structure that regulates motivated behavior. Pharmacological and genetic experiments show that anandamide mobilization and consequent activation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors are necessary and sufficient to express the rewarding properties of social interactions, assessed using a socially conditioned place preference test. We further show that oxytocin, a neuropeptide that reinforces parental and social bonding, drives anandamide mobilization in the NAc. Pharmacological blockade of oxytocin receptors stops this response, whereas chemogenetic, site-selective activation of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus stimulates it. Genetic or pharmacological interruption of anandamide degradation offsets the effects of oxytocin receptor blockade on both social place preference and cFos expression in the NAc. The results indicate that anandamide-mediated signaling at CB1 receptors, driven by oxytocin, controls social reward. Deficits in this signaling mechanism may contribute to social impairment in autism spectrum disorders and might offer an avenue to treat these conditions.",

In this study, a method for simultaneous determination of OXC and MHD in rat plasma using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS-MS) was developed and validated. Under given chromatographic conditions, OXC, MHD and internal standard diazepam were separated well and quantified by electrospray positive ionization mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring transitions mode. The method validation demonstrated good linearity over the range of 10-2,000 ng/mL for OXC and 5-1,000 ng/mL for MHD. The lower limit of quantification was 5 ng/mL for OXC and 2.5 ng/mL for MHD, respectively. The method was successfully applied to the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of OXC and MHD in rats, with or without pretreatment by ketoconazole (KET) and voriconazole (VOR).

In this study, the next-day residual effects of zolpidem, triazolam, and rilmazafone, following bedtime dosing in elderly subjects, were evaluated. Women (n\u2009=\u200911) and men (n\u2009=\u20092) aged 60-70 years received a single dose (at 23:00) of one of these, zolpidem 5\u2009mg, triazolam 0.125\u2009mg, rilmazafone 1\u2009mg and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design.

All hypnotics were generally well tolerated; there were no serious adverse side effects and no subjects discontinued the evaluations. Compared to placebo, zolpidem and rilmazafone had good results on the Functional Reach Test. Although subjective assessments tended to be poor in the early morning, rilmazafone significantly improved the body sway test in the other hypnotics. A single dose of zolpidem 5\u2009mg and triazolam 0.125\u2009mg did not have any next-day residual effects on healthy elderly subjects. Residual effects appeared to be related to the compound's half-life and the dose used.

    "144": "2'-Methoxy-6-methylflavone (2'MeO6MF) is an anxiolytic flavonoid which has been shown to display GABAA receptor (GABAAR) \u03b22/3-subunit selectivity, a pharmacological profile similar to that of the general anaesthetic etomidate. Electrophysiological studies suggest that the full agonist action of 2'MeO6MF at \u03b12\u03b23\u03b32L GABAARs may mediate the flavonoid's in vivo effects. However, we found variations in the relative efficacy of 2'MeO6MF (2'MeO6MF-elicited current responses normalised to the maximal GABA response) at \u03b12\u03b23\u03b32L GABAARs due to the presence of mixed receptor populations. To understand which receptor subpopulation(s) underlie the variations observed, we conducted a systematic investigation of 2'MeO6MF activity at all receptor combinations that could theoretically form (\u03b12, \u03b23, \u03b32L, \u03b12\u03b23, \u03b12\u03b32L, \u03b23\u03b32L and \u03b12\u03b23\u03b32L) in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. We found that 2'MeO6MF activated non-\u03b1-containing \u03b23\u03b32L receptors. In an attempt to establish the optimal conditions to express a uniform population of these receptors, we found that varying the relative amounts of \u03b23:\u03b32L subunit mRNAs resulted in differences in the level of constitutive activity, the GABA concentration-response relationships, and the relative efficacy of 2'MeO6MF activation. Like 2'MeO6MF, general anaesthetics such as etomidate and propofol also showed distinct levels of relative efficacy across different injection ratios. Based on these results, we infer that \u03b23\u03b32L receptors may form with different subunit stoichiometries, resulting in the complex pharmacology observed across different injection ratios. Moreover, the discovery that GABA and etomidate have direct actions at the \u03b1-lacking \u03b23\u03b32L receptors raises questions about the structural requirements for their respective binding sites at GABAARs.",

These meta-analyses found no statistically significant differences between the efficacy of propranolol and benzodiazepines regarding the short-term treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. Also, no evidence was found for effects of propranolol on PTSD symptom severity through inhibition of memory reconsolidation. In conclusion, the quality of evidence for the efficacy of propranolol at present is insufficient to support the routine use of propranolol in the treatment of any of the anxiety disorders.", 
    "184": "Opioids are often prescribed for chronic pain, and opioid risks such as overdose and death are heightened when opioids are co-prescribed with other sedating medications. We investigated factors associated with chronic opioid prescription, alone and in combination with benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants, in a clinical cohort of individuals with HIV. We used multivariable logistic regression models to determine participant clinical and demographic characteristics that are associated with chronic prescription of opioids or chronic co-prescription of opioids with sedating medications. Among 1474 participants, chronic prescription of opioids occurred in 253 individuals (17.2 %), and chronic co-prescription occurred in 90 individuals (6.1 %). Age >50, public insurance as compared to private insurance, and symptoms of depression and anxiety were significantly associated with chronic opioid prescription and chronic co-prescription. Our findings raise concern that opioid prescription and co-prescription of sedating medications occurs disproportionately in patients for whom use is riskier.",

Emotional instability, difficulties in regulating behavior and interpersonal relationships are essential features of the disorder. Borderline personality disorder has a more favorable course than previously thought. Dialectic behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, mentalization therapy and transference-focused psychotherapy seem to be effective. Hospital treatment should be carried out primarily in day hospital settings. Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers may be used for a range of symptoms. SSRIs may be useful in the treatment of impulsivity and aggression. Benzodiazepines should be avoided.", 
    "186": "Treatment strategies for mental disorders may vary according to illness stage. However no data currently exist to guide treatment in first episode psychotic mania. The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy profile of chlorpromazine and olanzapine, as add-on to lithium, in patients with a first episode of psychotic mania, expecting better safety profile and adherence to olanzapine but similar efficacy for both treatments.", 
    "187": "Data from 83 patients were collected in an 8-week randomised controlled trial on clinical variables, side effects, vital signs, and weight. Analyses of treatment differences over time were based on intent-to-treat principles.

    "188": "Ethics committee approval to delay informed consent procedure until recovery from the acute episode allowed the inclusion of 83 patients highly representative of those treated in the public sector. Contrary to our hypotheses, safety profile of both medications was similar. A signal for higher rate (P=.032) and earlier occurrence (P=.043) of mania remission was observed in the olanzapine group which did not survive correction for multiple comparisons.", 
    "189": "Olanzapine and chlorpromazine have a similar safety profile in a uniquely representative cohort of patients with first episode psychotic mania.

We investigated the effects of olanzapine on human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channels stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Olanzapine inhibited hERG tail currents at -50mV in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 8.0\u03bcM and a Hill coefficient of 0.9. The voltage-dependent inhibition of the hERG currents by olanzapine increased steeply in the voltage range of channel activation. Olanzapine also shifted the steady-state activation curve of the hERG currents in a hyperpolarizing direction. At more depolarized potentials where the channels were fully activated (between 0 and +50mV), the olanzapine inhibition was voltage-independent. The steady-state inactivation curve of the hERG currents was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction in the presence of olanzapine. A fast application of olanzapine induced a reversible inhibition of the hERG tail currents during repolarization in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 11.9\u03bcM, suggesting an open-channel block. Olanzapine also decreased the hERG current elicited by a 5s depolarizing pulse to +60mV to inactivate the hERG currents, suggesting an inhibition of the activated (open and/or inactivated) states of the channels. These results indicated that olanzapine inhibited the hERG current by preferentially interacting with the activated states of the channel.",

It is proven that neuroleptics positively affect new neuron formation in canonical neurogenic sites - subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles. Latest findings suggest that adult neurogenesis also occurs in several additional regions like the hypothalamus, amygdala, neocortex and striatum. As the hypothalamus is considered an important target of neuroleptics, a hypothesis can be made that these substances are able to modulate local neural proliferation.",

    "198": "It was shown that a single injection of antipsychotics causes significant decrease in hypothalamic DCX expression, but after chronic treatment with chlorpromazine, but not olanzapine, there is an increase in the number of newly formed neuroblasts. Haloperidol has the opposite effect - its long-term administration decreases the number of DCX-positive cells. Cell proliferation levels (Ki-67 expression) increase after long-term drug administration, whereas their single doses do not have any modulatory effect on proliferation potential.",

In detail, we have evaluated the effect of non-prohibited drugs belonging to the classes of anti-fungals, benzodiazepines, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the glucuronidation of 19-norandrosterone. In vitro assays based on the use of either pooled human liver microsomes or specific recombinant isoforms of uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl-transferase were designed and performed to monitor the formation of 19-norandrosterone glucuronide from 19-norandrosterone. Determination of 19-norandrosterone (free and conjugated fraction) was performed by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry after sample pretreatment consisting of an enzymatic hydrolysis (performed only for the conjugated fraction), liquid/liquid extraction with tert-butylmethyl ether, and derivatization to form the trimethylsilyl derivative. In parallel, a method based on reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry in positive electrospray ionization with acquisition in selected reaction monitoring mode was also developed to identify the non-prohibited drugs considered in this study. Incubation experiments have preliminarily shown that the glucuronidation of 19-norandrosterone is principally carried out by UGT2B7 (39%) and UGT2B17 (31%). Inhibition studies have shown that the yield of the glucuronidation reaction is reduced in the presence of the anti-fungals itraconazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole, of the benzodiazepine triazolam and of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and ibuprofen, while no alteration was recorded in the presence of all other compounds considered in this study.

Although evidence suggests that aberrant protein production and aggregation are the causative factors in familial subsets of such diseases, drugs singularly targeting these hallmark proteins, such as amyloid-\u03b2, have failed in late stage clinical trials. Therefore, to provide a successful disease-modifying compound and address synaptic dysfunction and memory loss in AD and mixed pathology dementia, we repurposed a clinically proven drug, CMZ, with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties via addition of nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP signaling property.",

In the western medication group, estazolam 1mg was prescribed, taken 30 min before going to bed, oryzanol 20 mg, oral administration, three times a day, for 4 weeks totally. In the acupuncture group, the simple acupuncture therapy was applied at Shenmen (HT 7), Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Anmian (Extra), Baihui (GV 20) and Sishencong (EX-HN 1), as well as the supplementary points selected according to the differentiation. The acupuncture treatment was given once a day, 5 treatments a week, for 4 weeks totally. In the integrated acupuncture and medication group, the western medication was combined with acupuncture. The dosage and usage of western medication were same as those in the western medication group; and acupoints in acupuncture treatment were same as those in the acupuncture group. The treatment lasted for 4 weeks in the three groups.

The total effective rates were 70. 0%(21/30), 93. 9%(31/33) and 97. 1%(34/35) in the three groups separately. The curative rates and the total effective rates in the integrated acupuncture and medication group and the acupuncture group were higher than those in the western medication group separately (all, P<0. 01). PSQI scores after 4 Weeks' treatment were all improved as compared with those before treatment in the three groups (all P<0. 05). PSQI score in either the integrated acupuncture and medication group or the acupuncture group was lower than that in the western medication group, indicating the significant difference (both P< 0. 05). Four weeks after discontinuity of treatment, the efficacy was stable in the acupuncture group and the integrated acupuncture and medication group. PSQI score did not change as compared with that in the 4th week of treatment. The score in the western medication group ran back, close to that before treatment (P>0. 05).

    "212": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the viability and growth rate of piglets after weaning, the content of lipids in the blood and liver, antioxidant activity (AOA) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) when various additives are used in feed. The experiments were performed on two crosses of piglets obtained from Large White breed sows and Landrace breed boars. Twenty to 28 animals were randomly assigned per group. The following additives were tested: the benzodiazepine phenazepam, the neuroleptic aminazine, vitamins E and C, and the extract Eleutherococcus senticosus (Araliaceae). Different doses and combinations of the additives against ultraviolet irradiation were used. The addition of these substances improved the growth rate and viability of piglets. AOA increased under the influence of all factors studied, especially with the addition of extract of Eleutherococcus in feed in combination with aminazine and UV-irradiation (p < 0.01). However, the addition of Eleutherococcus extract and aminazine intensified LPO (p < 0.01), but use of UV irradiation helped to decrease LPO values (p < 0.01). Feeding a mixture of additives per pig per day of 3 mL of Eleutherococcus extract, 80 mg of 25% tocopherol, and 500 mg of ascorbic acid increased survival rate, average daily gain, and live weight at the end of the experiment. Thus, the use of prophylactic antistress and sedative drugs during weaning helps AOA normalize LPO of red blood cells; enhance post weaning growth of the pigs by 4.8% to 24.6% and increases piglet survival rate by 5% to 5.1%.",

The two conformational enantiomers of clobazam interconvert at room temperature by a simple ring-flipping process. Variable temperature HPLC on the Pirkle type (R)-N-(3,5-dinitronenzoyl)phenylglycine and (R,R)-Whelk-O1 chiral stationary phases (CSPs) allowed us to separate for the first time the conformational enantiomers of clobazam and to observe peak coalescence-decoalescence phenomena due to concomitant separation and interconversion processes occurring on the same time scale. Clobazam showed temperature dependent dynamic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profiles with interconversion plateaus on the two CSPs indicative of on-column enantiomer interconversion. (enantiomerization) in the column temperature range between Tcol = 10\u00b0C and Tcol = 30\u00b0C, whereas on-column interconversion was absent at temperature close to or lower than Tcol = 5\u00b0C. Computer simulation of exchange-deformed HPLC profiles using a program based on the stochastic model yielded the apparent rate constants for the on-column enantiomerization and the corresponding free energy activation barriers. At Tcol = 20\u00b0C the averaged enantiomerization barriers, \u0394G(\u2021), for clobazam were found in the range 21.08-21.53 kcal mol(-1) on the two CSPs. The experimental dynamic chromatograms and the corresponding interconversion barriers reported in this article are consistent with the literature data measured by DNMR at higher temperatures and in different solvents.",

    "218": "Morphine has for a long time, been used in patients with acute pulmonary oedema due to its anticipated anxiolytic and vasodilatory properties, however a discussion about the benefits and risks has been raised recently. A literature search in Medline and Embase using the keywords \"pulmonary oedema\" OR \"lung oedema\" OR \"acute heart failure\" AND \"morphine\" was performed. A certain vasodilation has been described after morphine administration, but the evidence for this mechanism is relatively poor and morphine-induced anxiolysis may possibly be the most important factor of morphine in pulmonary oedema and therefore some authors have suggested benzodiazepines as an alternative treatment. Respiratory depression seems to be a less relevant clinical problem according to the literature, whereas vomiting is common, which may cause aspiration. In the largest outcome study, based on the ADHERE registry, morphine given in acute decompensated heart failure was an independent predictor of increased hospital mortality, with an odds ratio of 4.8 (95% CI: 4.52-5.18, p<0.001). Other, smaller studies have shown a significant association between morphine administration and mortality, which was lost after adjusting for confounding factors. Morphine is still used for pulmonary oedema in spite of poor scientific background data. A randomised, controlled study is necessary in order to determine the effect--and especially the risk--when using morphine for pulmonary oedema. Since the positive effects are not sufficiently documented, and since the risk for increased mortality cannot be ruled out, one can advocate that the use should be avoided.",

The effect of olanzapine administration (7.5mg/kg/day), on rat hepatic glutathione (GSH)-dependent defense and proinflammatory cytokines following 6weeks of chronic social isolation (CSIS), which causes depressive- and anxiety-like behavior in adult male Wistar rats, was investigated. The subcellular distribution of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), cytosolic inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein levels and hepatic histological alterations were also determined. Decreased GSH content and glutathione reductase activity associated with increased catalase and glutathione S-transferase activity following CSIS indicated hepatic oxidative stress. Moreover, CSIS caused NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation and the concomitant increase in iNOS together with increase in interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha protein levels, but no effect on interleukin-6. Olanzapine treatment suppressed NF-\u03baB activation and iNOS expression and caused modulation of GSH-dependent defense systems but failed to reverse CSIS-induced increase in hepatic proinflammatory cytokines. Portal inflammation, focal hepatocyte necrosis and an increased number of Kupffer cells in CSIS rats (vehicle- or olanzapine-treated) were found. Olanzapine-treated socially reared rats showed portal inflammation and focal hepatocyte necrosis. Data suggest that CSIS compromised GSH-dependent defense, triggered a proinflammatory response and histological alterations in rat liver. Olanzapine treatment partially reversed the alterations in hepatic GSH-dependent defense, but showed no anti-inflammatory effect suggesting that it may provide protective effect against hepatic CSIS-induced oxidative stress, but not against inflammation.",

The carrier was injected into muscle, where cellular activity was employed to achieve the goal of constant release. Mesoporous hydroxyapatite (mesoHAP) was synthesized into an adequate size by a coprecipitation method; it then went through a series of hydrophobic surface modifications for olanzapine (OLZ) loading by physical absorption to produce mesoHAP-OLZ. Because of its hydrophobic nature, OLZ was not effectively released from mesoHAP-OLZ in an aqueous environment. However, once engulfed by macrophages, the lysosome/endosome hybrid ruptured due to alterations in osmotic pressure, resulting in the release of OLZ into the cytoplasm. OLZ was then exocytosed to the extracellular space due to a high calcium ion (Ca(2+)) concentration and finally reached the blood circulation. Our findings provide a useful treatment strategy to achieve long-term drug release with a single intramuscular (IM) injection, helping to solve the problem of nonadherent medication intake that often occurs in antidepressant therapy.", 
    "235": "The clinical efficacy of standardized essential oils (such as Lavender officinalis), in treating anxiety disorders strongly suggests that these natural products are an important candidate source for new anxiolytic drugs. A systematic review of essential oils, their bioactive constituents, and anxiolytic-like activity is conducted. The essential oil with the best profile is Lavendula angustifolia, which has already been tested in controlled clinical trials with positive results. Citrus aurantium using different routes of administration also showed significant effects in several animal models, and was corroborated by different research groups. Other promising essential oils are Citrus sinensis and bergamot oil, which showed certain clinical anxiolytic actions; along with Achillea wilhemsii, Alpinia zerumbet, Citrus aurantium, and Spiranthera odoratissima, which, like Lavendula angustifolia, appear to exert anxiolytic-like effects without GABA/benzodiazepine activity, thus differing in their mechanisms of action from the benzodiazepines. The anxiolytic activity of 25 compounds commonly found in essential oils is also discussed.", 
    "236": "Pharmacological treatment of acute anxiety still relies on benzodiazepines, while chronic anxiety disorders and depression are treated with different antidepressants, according to specific indications. The monoaminergic axis is represented by two families which are being developed: (i) serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (SNDRI), also called triple reuptake inhibitors (TRI), for the treatment of depression (amitifadine), (ii) multimodal antidepressants for depression and anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder mainly) (tedatioxetine, vortioxetine and vilazodone). Third-generation antipsychotics (aripiprazole, lurasidone, brexpiprazole, cariprazine) appear relevant in the treatment of resistant depression and some anxiety disorders. Among the modulators of the glutamatergic axis, promising compounds include: (i) ionotropic regulators of NMDA receptors: esketamine, AVP-923\u00a0and AVP-786, CERC-301, rapastinel (Glyx-13), NRX-1074\u00a0developed for depression, rapastinel and bitopertine developed for obsessive compulsive disorder, (ii) metabotropic glutamate receptors modulators: decoglurant and basimglurant developed for depression and mavoglurant developed for obsessive compulsive disorder.", 
    "237": "Second generation antipsychotics are useful for the treatment of schizophrenia, but concerns have been raised about the side effects of diabetes mellitus and obesity. Olanzapine, especially, is associated with more weight gain than the others. It has been reported that olanzapine promotes adipocyte-differentiation in rodents both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro. In this study the effects of antipsychotics on human adipocytes were investigated by using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). When hMSCs were differentiated and treated with various antipsychotics, olanzapine and clozapine increased intracellular lipids. Olanzapine induced lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. Proteomic analysis revealed that PLIN4 and several enzymes for lipid metabolism were increased in the hMSCs after olanzapine treatment. During adipocyte differentiation, olanzapine increased the protein expression of PLIN1, PLIN2 and PLIN4. These proteins are known to be associated with the initial stage of lipid droplet formation. Immunocytochemistry showed that olanzapine increased and enlarged the lipid droplets coated with PLIN1 and PLIN2 while PLIN4 was largely distributed in the cytosol. mRNA expression of PLIN2, but not PLIN1 or PLIN4, was increased by olanzapine. On the other hand, olanzapine did not alter the mRNA level of transcription regulators involved in adipocyte-differentiation or adipokines. The present study shows that olanzapine induced transient PLIN2 expression in hMSCs that could result in an accumulation of lipid droplets and overexpression of PLIN1 and PLIN4, providing information of possible interest for olanzapine-induced weight gain.", 
    "238": "Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury death in the United States. The death rate from drug overdose in the United States more than doubled during 1999-2013, from 6.0 per 100,000 population in 1999 to 13.8 in 2013. The increase in drug overdoses is attributable primarily to the misuse and abuse of prescription drugs, especially opioid analgesics, sedatives/tranquilizers, and stimulants. Such drugs are prescribed widely in the United States, with substantial variation by state. Certain patients obtain drugs for nonmedical use or resale by obtaining overlapping prescriptions from multiple prescribers. The risk for overdose is directly associated with the use of multiple prescribers and daily dosages of >100 morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per day.", 
    "239": "2013.", 
    "240": "The Prescription Behavior Surveillance System (PBSS) is a public health surveillance system that allows public health authorities to characterize and quantify the use and misuse of prescribed controlled substances. PBSS began collecting data in 2012 and is funded by CDC and the Food and Drug Administration. PBSS uses standard metrics to measure prescribing rates per 1,000 state residents by demographic variables, drug type, daily dose, and source of payment. Data from the system can be used to calculate rates of misuse by certain behavioral measures such as use of multiple prescribers and pharmacies within specified time periods. This report is based on 2013 de-identified data (most recent available) that represent approximately one fourth of the U.S.", 
    "241": "Data were submitted quarterly by prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) in eight states (California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Ohio, and West Virginia) that routinely collect data on every prescription for a controlled substance to help law enforcement and health care providers identify misuse or abuse of such drugs.", 
    "242": "In all eight states, opioid analgesics were prescribed approximately twice as often as stimulants or benzodiazepines. Prescribing rates by drug class varied widely by state: twofold for opioids, fourfold for stimulants, almost twofold for benzodiazepines, and eightfold for carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant. Rates for opioids and benzodiazepines were substantially higher for females than for males in all states. In most states, opioid prescribing rates peaked in either the 45-54 years or the 55-64 years age group. Benzodiazepine prescribing rates increased with age. Louisiana ranked first in opioid prescribing, and Delaware and Maine had relatively high rates of use of long-acting (LA) or extended-release (ER) opioids. Delaware and Maine ranked highest in both mean daily opioid dosage and in the percentage of opioid prescriptions written for >100 MMEs per day. The top 1% of prescribers wrote one in four opioid prescriptions in Delaware, compared with one in eight in Maine. For the five states whose PDMPs collected the method of payment, the percentage of controlled substance prescriptions paid for in cash varied almost threefold, and the percentage paid by Medicaid varied sixfold. In West Virginia, for 1 of every 5 days of treatment with an opioid, the patient also was taking a benzodiazepine. Multiple-provider episode rates were highest in Ohio and lowest in Louisiana.", 
    "243": "This report presents rates of population-based prescribing and behavioral measures of drug misuse in the general population that have not been available previously for comparison among demographic groups and states. The higher prescribing rates for opioids among women compared with men are consistent with a higher self-reported prevalence of certain common types of pain, such as lower back pain among women. The trend in opioid prescribing rates with age is consistent with an increase in the prevalence of chronic pain with age, but the increasing prescribing rates of benzodiazepines with age is not consistent with the fact that anxiety is most common among persons aged 30-44 years. The variation among states in the type of opioid or benzodiazepine of choice is unexplained. Most opioid prescribing occurs among a small minority of prescribers. Most of the prescriptions by top-decile prescribers probably are written by general, family medicine, internal medicine, and midlevel practitioners. The source of payment varied by state, for reasons that are unclear. Persons who are prescribed opioids also are commonly prescribed benzodiazepine sedatives despite the risk for additive depressant effects.", 
    "244": "States can use their prescription drug monitoring programs to generate population-based measures for the prescribing of controlled substances and for behaviors that suggest their misuse. Comparing data with other states and tracking changes in these measures over time can be useful in measuring the effect of policies designed to reduce prescription drug misuse.", 
    "245": "Flumazenil and naloxone are considered to be pharmacologically ideal antidotes. By competitive binding at the molecular target receptors, they are highly specific antagonists of two important drug classes, the benzodiazepines and opioids, respectively. Both antidotes enjoy rapid onset and short duration after parenteral administration, are easily titrated and are essentially devoid of agonist effects. Yet only naloxone is widely used as a component of the 'coma cocktail', a sequence of empirical treatments to correct altered mental status, while experts discourage the use of flumazenil for such patients. This review contrasts the history, indications, published evidence and novel applications for each antidote in order to explain this disparity in the clinical use of these 'ideal' antidotes.", 
    "246": "In July 2014, a 66 year-old lady presented to emergency department after having not been seen for 3 days. She was eventually found in bed not responding verbally. The ambulance service reported tonic-clonic seizures lasting 10-30\u00a0s every 3\u00a0min. The patient was treated for her seizures with phenytoin and additional benzodiazepines as required. Her seizure had temporarily resolved and she was admitted for investigations. She had no history of epilepsy or seizures. The history of alcoholism and lack of any substantial history of epilepsy, left the team considering whether this was an alcohol induced event or a pseudoseizure. The patient referred to no prodrome, no tongue biting/incontinence and lacked any convincing post-ictal phases. The seizures were no longer tonic-clonic but evolved into focal motor, with right-sided facial twitching lasting 2\u00a0min. Her investigations from bloods, lumbar puncture, computerised tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging were all normal which led the team to consider whether this was a pseudoseizure. The patient appeared unconscious during seizures but was rousable during the episodes, although she claimed to have no recollection of them after. The seizures frequency settled at 30/day after being resistant to most antiepileptic regimes, except the eventual combination of Levetiracetam 1000\u00a0mg BD and Sodium Valproate 400\u00a0mg which left her seizure-free. However, the key evidence separating pseudoseizures and epilepsy partialis continua lay in collecting video evidence. This rare but important differential can often be overlooked but is especially important in the elderly, in whom this condition can mask serious underlying pathology.", 
    "247": "Antianxiety action of diterpene alkaloid songorine was studied using Vogel conflict test. Songorine in a dose of 0.25 mg/kg demonstrated high anxiolytic activity comparable to that of phenazepam and produced no sedative effect."
