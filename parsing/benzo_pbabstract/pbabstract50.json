    "0": "Evidence-based treatment approaches for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) comprise psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of the two. First-line pharmacotherapy agents include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and, in certain European guidelines, pregabalin, which gained European Commission approval. Although short- and long-term efficacy have been established for these agents in controlled trials, response rates of 60-70 % are insufficient, remission rates are relatively modest, and relapse rates considerable. Moreover, questions increasingly arise regarding tolerability and side-effect profiles. As an alternative, antipsychotics have long been of interest for the treatment of anxiety disorders, but investigation had been tempered by their potential for irreversible side effects. With the improved side-effect profiles of atypical antipsychotics, these agents are increasingly being investigated across Axis I disorders. Atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and risperidone have been shown to be helpful in addressing a range of anxiety and depressive symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, and have since been used in the treatment of a range of mood and anxiety disorders. In this article, we review the efficacy and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy and/or monotherapy for individuals with GAD, a currently off-label indication. The most evidence has accumulated for quetiapine. Findings suggest that approximately 50 % of participants tolerate the side effects, most commonly sedation and fatigue. Among this subset, those who continue treatment demonstrate significant reductions in anxiety when used as adjunctive therapy or monotherapy. The appropriateness of the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of GAD is discussed.", 
    "1": "Changes in cytoplasmic pH are known to regulate diverse cellular processes and influence neuronal activities. In neurons, the intracellular alkalization is shown to occur after stimulating several channels and receptors. For example, it has previously demonstrated in P19 neurons that a sustained intracellular alkalinization can be mediated by the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter. In addition, the benzodiazepine binding subtypes of the \u03b3-amino butyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor mediate a transient intracellular alkalinization when they are stimulated. Because the activities of many enzymes are sensitive to pH shift, here we investigate the effects of intracellular pH modulation resulted from stimulating GABAA receptor on the protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) activities. We show that the major benzodiazepine subtype (2\u03b11, 2\u03b22, 1\u03b32) is constitutively expressed in both undifferentiated P19 cells and retinoic acid (RA) differentiated P19 neurons. Furthermore stimulation with diazepam and, diazepam plus muscimol produce an intracellular alkalinization that can be detected ex vivo with the fluorescence dye. The alkalinization results in significant perturbation in protein arginine methylation activity as measured in methylation assays with specific protein substrates. Altered protein arginine methylation is also observed when cells are treated with the GABAA agonist muscimol but not an antagonist, bicuculline. These data suggest that pH-dependent and pH-independent methylation pathways can be activated by GABAAergic stimulation, which we verified using hippocampal slice preparations from a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.",

Although acute and delayed vomiting have become well managed with the advent of the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists, such as ondansetron, and the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists (such as aprepitant), nausea is still a relatively unmanaged adverse side effect of chemotherapy treatment. When nausea and vomiting are not properly managed, patients are at a greater risk of developing anticipatory nausea (AN)--a conditional association between chemotherapy-related treatment cues, such as the clinic environment, and the subsequent nausea experienced. Once it develops, AN is refractive to pharmacological treatment with classic antiemetics. Currently, non-specific antianxiety drugs (benzodiazepines) are prescribed; however, their sedating side effects are undesirable. Here, we review the animal models of AN that have been developed. These preclinical models have aided researchers in the evaluation of potentially efficacious pharmacological treatments for AN. Accumulating evidence using animal models demonstrates that cannabinoid compounds effectively reduce AN, without producing sedation. These results highlight the need for human clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of these compounds.",

The purpose of this study was to find out whether myricetin influences the rat cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4) by using cocktail probe drugs in vivo. A cocktail solution at a dose of 5 mL/kg, which contained phenacetin (20 mg/kg), tolbutamide (5 mg/kg) and midazolam (10 mg/kg), was orally administered to rats treated for 14 days with myricetin. Blood samples were collected at a series of time-points and the concentrations of probe drugs in plasma were determined by HPLC-MS/MS. The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the software of DAS 2.0. Our study showed that treatment with multiple doses of myricetin had no effects on rat CYP1A2. However, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities were inhibited after multiple doses of myricetin. Therefore, caution is needed when myricetin is co-administered with CYP2C9 or CYP3A4 substrates, which may result in herb-drug interactions.",

There is a lack of consensus upon its semantic definition of whether it is status epilepticus that continues despite treatment with benzodiazepine and one antiepileptic medication (AED), i.e., Lorazepam + phenytoin. Others regard refractory status epilepticus as failure of benzodiazepine and 2 antiepileptic medications, i.e., Lorazepam + phenytoin + phenobarb. Up to 30% patients in SE fail to respond to two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and 15% continue to have seizure activity despite use of three drugs. Mechanisms that have made the treatment even more challenging are GABA-R that is internalized during status epilepticus and upregulation of multidrug transporter proteins. All patients of refractory status epilepticus require continuous EEG monitoring. There are three main agents used in the treatment of RSE. These include pentobarbital or thiopental, midazolam and propofol. RSE was shown to result in mortality in 35% cases, 39.13% of patients were left with severe neurological deficits, while another 13% had mild neurological deficits.",

The protocol for management of SE is intravenous benzodiazepine, followed by phenytoin, valproate (VPA) and phenobarbitone and if uncontrolled general anesthesia (GA). World Federation of Neurology recommends special guidelines for resource poor countries. Use of GA results in hypotension and respiratory depression needing intensive care management. There is a paucity of intensive care facilities hence the recommended antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) which have inherent toxicity of hypotension and respiratory failure cannot be given safely. Under these situations AEDs such as VPA, levetiracetam and lacosamide may be evaluated in SE because of cardiovascular and respiratory safety profile. In this review, the limitations of existing guidelines in the developing countries have been discussed and a way forward has been suggested.",

At baseline, the obese/metabolic syndrome rats had increased respiratory rates (21.6%), lower tidal volumes/body weight (-24.1%), and no differences in minute ventilation compared to lean/fit rats. In the obese rats, respiratory rate was decreased by dexmedetomidine (-29%), but not eszopiclone. In the lean and the obese rats, eszopiclone decreased tidal volume (-12%). Both sedative/hypnotic drugs caused a greater decrease in minute ventilation in the obese (-26.3%) than lean (-18%) rats. Inspiratory flow rate (VT / TI) of the obese rats was decreased by dexmedetomidine (-10.6%) and eszopiclone (-18%). Duty cycle (TI / TTOT) in both rat lines was decreased by dexmedetomidine (-16.5%) but not by eszopiclone.", 
    "32": "Dexmedetomidine, in contrast to eszopiclone, decreased minute ventilation in the obese/metabolic syndrome rats by depressing both duty cycle and inspiratory flow rate. The results show for the first time that the obese phenotype differentially modulates the respiratory effects of eszopiclone and dexmedetomidine. These differences in breathing are consistent with previously documented differences in sleep between lean/fit and obese rats. These findings also encourage future studies of obese/metabolic syndrome rats that quantify the effect of sedative/hypnotic drugs on respiratory mechanics as well as hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory responses. Continued findings of favorable homology between obese humans and rodents will support the interpretation that these obese rats offer a unique animal model for mechanistic studies.", 
    "33": "We investigated the psychostimulant, rewarding, and anxiolytic-like effects of pulegone. Possible interactions between pulegone and menthol concerning their psychostimulant effect were also analyzed. General mouse activity after pulegone treatment, and the interacitons between pulegone and menthol, were determined in the open field. The anxiolytic-like activity, motor coordination and strength force were evaluated using the elevated plus maze (EPM), rotarod test and grasping test, respectively. The motivational properties of pulegone were evaluated by pairing the drug effects on the mice with the least preferred compartment (previously determined) of a conditioned place preference (CPP) apparatus. Pulegone increased mouse locomotor activity and immobilization time. Verapamil, but not diltiazem, haloperidol or picrotoxin, decreased the psychostimulation induced by pulegone. Pulegone also decreased grooming and rearing behaviors and caused motor incoordination and weakness at high doses. Pulegone increased the time spent by mice in the open arms of the EPM, and flumazenil pre-treatment did not alter this effect. Pulegone either produced no CPP or induced conditioned place aversion. The changes in mouse ambulatory activity caused by the association of pulegone with menthol were either lower than those predicted by the theoretical curve or not different from the predicted values. Therefore, pulegone induces a verapamil-sensitive psychostimulant effect that appears to independ on the opening of L-type calcium channels. Pulegone has negative reinforcing properties and seems to possess anxiolytic-like actions unrelated to the benzodiazepine site of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. Finally, pulegone might act in an addictive or synergic way with menthol.",

The five-dimension EuroQoL (EQ-5D) was used to evaluate QoL, and side effects were assessed using the Udvalg for Kliniske Unders\u00f8gelser (UKU) Side Effect Rating Scale and the Simpson-Angus Scale. Data were analysed using the \u03c7 (2) test and Student's t test, with a significance level of 5 %. Average monthly household incomes in the medication groups were 1.1-2.1 minimum wages ($339-$678). UKU Scale scores showed significant differences in side effects, mainly, clozapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone (p < 0.05). EQ-5D scores showed that all drugs except olanzapine significantly impacted mobility (p < 0.05), and proportions of individuals reporting problems in other dimensions were high: 63.6 % of clozapine users reported mobility problems, 63.7 and 56.3 % of clozapine and ziprasidone users, respectively, had difficulties with usual activities, 68.8 and 54.5 % of ziprasidone and clozapine users, respectively, experienced pain and/or discomfort, and 72.8 % of clozapine users reported anxiety and/or depression. Psychiatric, neurological, and autonomous adverse effects, as well as other side effects, were prevalent in users of atypical antipsychotic drugs, especially clozapine and ziprasidone. Olanzapine had the least side effects. QoL was impacted by side effects and economic conditions in all groups. Thus, the effects of these antipsychotic agents appear to have been masked by aggravating social and economic situations.", 
    "36": "The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of midazolam in inhibiting the proliferation of hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma cells. Cultured FaDu cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of midazolam. MTT and BrdU incorporation assays were then used to evaluate cancer cell proliferation. The mRNA and protein levels of p300, a key factor involved in the tumorigenesis of numerous cancers, were measured with RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Midazolam inhibited the expression of p300 and the proliferation of FaDu cells. Additionally, knockdown of p300 resulted in increased expression of p21 and p27 and decreased expression of p-Rb while inhibiting the proliferation of FaDu cells. Midazolam inhibits the proliferation of human head and neck squamous carcinoma cells by downregulating p300. Midazolam may be useful for the treatment of hypopharyngeal squamous cancers.",

The method involves a pre-concentration and cleanup step, carried out by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using the adsorbent Strata-XC, followed by the instrumental analysis performed by LC-MS/MS, using a Kinetex pentafluorophenyl (PFP) reversed-phase fused-core column and electrospray ionization (ESI) in both positive and negative modes. A systematic optimization of mobile phases was performed to cope with the wide range of physicochemical properties of the analytes. The PFP column was also compared with two reversed-phase columns: fused-core C18 and XB-C18 (with a cross-butyl C18 ligand). SPE optimization and critical aspects associated with the trace level determination of the target compounds (e.g., matrix effects) have been also considered and discussed. Fragmentation patterns for all the classes were proposed. The validated method provides absolute recoveries between 75 and 120% for most compounds in IWW and EWW. Low method limits of detection were achieved (between 0.04 and 10.0 ng/L for 87% of the compounds), allowing a reliable and accurate quantification of the analytes at trace level. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of these compounds in five wastewater treatment plants in Santorini, a touristic island of the Aegean Sea, Greece. Thirty-two out of 68 compounds were detected in all IWW samples in the range between 0.6 ng/L (for nordiazepam) and 6,822 ng/L (for carbamazepine) and 22 out of 68 in all EWW samples, with values between 0.4 ng/L (for 9-OH risperidone) and 2,200 ng/L (for carbamazepine).

Commonly, the employed methods include many manual or partly automated steps like protein precipitation, dilution, solid phase extraction, evaporation, and derivatization preceding a gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectrometry (MS) or liquid chromatography (LC)/MS analysis. In this study, a comprehensively automated method was developed from a validated, partly automated routine method. This was possible by replicating method parameters on the automated system. Only marginal optimization of parameters was necessary. The automation relying on an x-y-z robot after manual protein precipitation includes the solid phase extraction, evaporation of the eluate, derivatization (silylation with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide, MSTFA), and injection into a GC/MS. A quantitative analysis of almost 170 authentic serum samples and more than 50 authentic samples of other matrices like urine, different tissues, and heart blood on cocaine, benzoylecgonine, methadone, morphine, codeine, 6-monoacetylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, and 7-aminoflunitrazepam was conducted with both methods proving that the analytical results are equivalent even near the limits of quantification (low ng/ml range).

We describe the use of C. elegans to explore 2 pharmacologic questions concerning candidate antiobesity drugs and illustrate its potential usefulness in pharmacologic research: (1) to determine a ratio of betahistine-olanzapine that blocks the olanzapine-induced intestinal fat deposition (IFD) as detected by Nile red staining and (2) to identify the mechanism of action of a pharmaceutical candidate AB-101 that reduces IFD. Olanzapine (53 \u03bcg/mL) increased the IFD (12.1 \u00b1 0.1%, P < 0.02), which was blocked by betahistine (763 \u03bcg/mL, 39.3 \u00b1 0.01%, P < 0.05) in wild-type C. elegans (N2). AB-101 (1.0%) reduced the IFD in N2 (P < 0.05), increased the pharyngeal pumping rate (P < 0.05), and reversed the elevated IFD induced by protease inhibitors atazanavir and ritonavir (P < 0.05). AB-101 did not affect IFD in a ACS null mutant strain acs-4(ok2872) III/hT2[bli-4(e937) let-?(q782) qIs48](I;III) suggesting an involvement of the lipid oxidation pathway and an upregulation of CPT-1.

Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor disturbance (including waxy flexibility and catalepsy), stupor, excitement, negativism, mutism, echopraxia and echolalia. Catatonia associated with SLE has been only rarely reported, especially in children. Here we present a case of a 14-year-old patient encountered in consultation-liaison psychiatry who presented catatonia associated with SLE. Her catatonia was refractory to treatment with pulse methylprednisolone, intravenous cyclophosphamide and rituximab. The patient responded to a combined therapy of electroconvulsive therapy and benzodiazepines. The present case suggests that although rarely reported, catatonia seen in the background of SLE should be promptly identified and treated to reduce the morbidity.", 
    "58": "The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor evacetrapib has been previously shown to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, as monotherapy or in combination with statins. In this study, 165 Japanese patients with elevated LDL-C or low HDL-C levels were randomly assigned to receive placebo, evacetrapib monotherapy 30 mg, 100 mg, or 500 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, or evacetrapib 100 mg in combination with atorvastatin 10 mg. After 12 weeks, evacetrapib monotherapy increased HDL-C levels by 74%, 115%, and 136% and decreased LDL-C levels by 15%, 23%, and 22% and CETP activity by 50%, 83%, and 95% (for the 30-mg, 100-mg, and 500-mg dose groups, respectively) versus placebo. In combination with atorvastatin 10 mg, evacetrapib 100 mg increased HDL-C levels by 103% and decreased LDL-C levels by 15% and CETP activity by 68% versus atorvastatin alone. After a 4- to 6-week washout, HDL-C, LDL-C, and CETP mass and activity returned to baseline levels in the evacetrapib-treated groups, and most patients had evacetrapib concentrations below the quantitation limit. Evacetrapib monotherapy or in combination with atorvastatin was not likely to be associated with any significant change in blood pressure and did not have any adverse effects on mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid measures. Notably, plasma evacetrapib concentrations were mostly undetectable, and all pharmacodynamic biomarkers (HDL-C and LDL-C levels and CETP mass and activity) returned to baseline after a 4- to 6-week washout. In conclusion, evacetrapib as monotherapy or in combination with atorvastatin effectively decreased CETP activity and LDL-C levels and increased HDL-C levels after 12 weeks in Japanese patients with dyslipidemia.", 
    "59": "The oligomycin-sensitivity conferring protein (OSCP) of the mitochondrial F(O)F1 ATP synthase has long been recognized to be essential for the coupling of proton transport to ATP synthesis. Located on top of the catalytic F1 sector, it makes stable contacts with both F1 and the peripheral stalk, ensuring the structural and functional coupling between F(O) and F1, which is disrupted by the antibiotic, oligomycin. Recent data have established that OSCP is the binding target of cyclophilin (CyP) D, a well-characterized inducer of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), whose opening can precipitate cell death. CyPD binding affects ATP synthase activity, and most importantly, it decreases the threshold matrix Ca\u00b2\u207a required for PTP opening, in striking analogy with benzodiazepine 423, an apoptosis-inducing agent that also binds OSCP. These findings are consistent with the demonstration that dimers of ATP synthase generate Ca\u00b2\u207a-dependent currents with features indistinguishable from those of the PTP and suggest that ATP synthase is directly involved in PTP formation, although the underlying mechanism remains to be established. In this scenario, OSCP appears to play a fundamental role, sensing the signal(s) that switches the enzyme of life in a channel able to precipitate cell death.", 
    "60": "This study aimed to investigate national prescription trends of benzodiazepines (BZD) for adults between 2007 and 2011 using Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) database in South Korea. Data analysis was performed by claim unit or patient unit. For the analysis of patient unit, each claim was merged by the same patient. Defined daily dose (DDD) was used to analyze the data in terms of dose and periods of BZD prescription. We identified a total of 22,361,449 adult patients who had BZD prescription at least once in 1,989,263 claims during 5 years. The average national BZD prescription prevalence for 1 year was 23.7%, 7.9%, 4.7%, and 3.2% of >= 1 day supply, >= 30 days supply, >= 90 days supply, and >= 180 days supply, respectively. The trends for 5 years were very similar. Among study population, 87.7% visited only non-psychiatric departments and the most frequent indication was gastrointestinal related diseases. BZD consumption expressed as DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day was 109.2. BZD consumption tended to be ~ 4 x higher in elderly than that of non-elderly (268.6 vs. 60.0 in male and 367.7 vs. 90.9 in female). Our study indicated the possibilities for inappropriate prescription of BZD, and the limitation policy on continuous prescription over 30 days supply did not seem to be effective. The effective interventions including an educational program for appropriate prescription of BZD should be considered.", 
    "61": "The fruits of Schisandra chinensis have been used for the treatment of insomnia in oriental countries for more than thousands of years. However, the pharmacological properties and the mechanism of sedative and hypnotic effects have not yet been studied. Gomisin N is one of the major bioactive constituents from the fruits of Schisandra chinensis, and in this paper we reported a detailed study on the effects and mechanisms of Gomisin N on its sedative and hypnotic activity for the first time. These results implied that Gomisin N possessed weak sedative effects on locomotion activity in normal mice, and produced a dose-dependent(5-45 mg/kg, i.p.) increase in sleep duration in pentobarbital-treated mice, thus, itself did not induce sleep at higher dose which was used in this experiment (45 mg/kg, i.p.). It also can reverse the rodent models of insomnia induced by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and caffeine, which could exhibit a synergistic effect with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) as well; furthermore, the hypnotic effects of Gomisin N were inhibited by flumazenil (a specific GABAA-BZD receptor antagonist). Altogether, these results indicated that Gomisin N produced beneficial sedative and hypnotic bioactivity, which might be mediated by the modification of the serotonergic and GABAergic system.", 
    "62": "Paraoxon (POX) is an active metabolite of organophosphate (OP) pesticide parathion that has been weaponized and used against civilian populations. Exposure to POX produces high mortality. OP poisoning is often associated with chronic neurological disorders. In this study, we optimize a rat survival model of lethal POX exposures in order to mimic both acute and long-term effects of POX intoxication. Male Sprague-Dawley rats injected with POX (4mg/kg, ice-cold PBS, s.c.) produced a rapid cholinergic crisis that evolved into status epilepticus (SE) and death within 6-8min. The EEG profile for POX induced SE was characterized and showed clinical and electrographic seizures with 7-10Hz spike activity. Treatment of 100% lethal POX intoxication with an optimized three drug regimen (atropine, 2mg/kg, i.p., 2-PAM, 25mg/kg, i.m. and diazepam, 5mg/kg, i.p.) promptly stopped SE and reduced acute mortality to 12% and chronic mortality to 18%. This model is ideally suited to test effective countermeasures against lethal POX exposure. Animals that survived the POX SE manifested prolonged elevations in hippocampal [Ca(2+)]i (Ca(2+) plateau) and significant multifocal neuronal injury. POX SE induced Ca(2+) plateau had its origin in Ca(2+) release from intracellular Ca(2+) stores since inhibition of ryanodine/IP3 receptor lowered elevated Ca(2+) levels post SE. POX SE induced neuronal injury and alterations in Ca(2+) dynamics may underlie some of the long term morbidity associated with OP toxicity.",

NIV at 12/5 cm H2O and FIO2 0.40 was applied, and albuterol at 40 mg/h was initiated. Admission arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 6.95, P(aCO2) 126 mm Hg, and P(aO2) 316 mm Hg. After 90 min of therapy, P(aCO2) was 63 mm Hg. Improvement continued, and NIV was stopped 4 h following presentation. NIV tolerance was supported with low doses of lorazepam. The patient was transferred to the ICU, moved to general care the next morning, and discharged 3 days later. We attribute our success to close monitoring in a critical care setting and the titration of lorazepam.", 
    "64": "Diurnal changes in the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes may contribute to the variability in drug disposition and drug effects. The aim of this study was to quantify the circadian rhythmicity exhibited by hepatic CYP3A. A 10 \u03bcg/kg intravenous bolus dose, followed by a 30-hour 4 \u03bcg/kg/h intravenous infusion of midazolam, used as a probe substrate for hepatic CYP3A activity, was administered to 16 healthy volunteers (8 males and 8 females). Blood samples were drawn hourly for 24 hours after achieving steady state, and plasma concentrations of midazolam and its main metabolite 1-OH midazolam were determined. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using nonlinear mixed effects modeling. One-compartment pharmacokinetic models best described midazolam and 1-OH midazolam pharmacokinetic disposition. An unequivocal but minor diurnal pattern was identified in the midazolam plasma concentration profiles, which was described using a cosine function with a 24-hours period. The fluctuation in the relative CYP3A activity ranged between 10% above average around 15:00, and 10% below average around 03:00. None of the covariates tested had a significant impact on the parameters estimated. Although a diurnal pattern in hepatic CYP3A activity was identified, its magnitude suggests that it is small and without clinical significance for drug therapy.", 
    "65": "Alcohol withdrawal is a common condition encountered in the hospital setting after abrupt discontinuation of alcohol in an alcohol-dependent individual. Patients may present with mild symptoms of tremulousness and agitation or more severe symptoms including withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Management revolves around early identification of at-risk individuals and symptom assessment using a validated tool such as the revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol score. Benzodiazepines remain the mainstay of treatment and can be administered using a front-loading, fixed-dose, or symptom-triggered approach. Long-acting benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam are commonly used and may provide a smoother withdrawal than shorter-acting benzodiazepines, but there are no data to support superiority of one benzodiazepine over another. Elderly patients or those with significant liver disease may have increased accumulation and decreased clearance of the long-acting benzodiazepines, and lorazepam or oxazepam may be preferred in these patients. Patients with symptoms refractory to high doses of benzodiazepines may require addition of a rescue medication such as phenobarbital, propofol or dexmedetomidine. Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, valproate, gabapentin) may have a role in the management of mild to moderate withdrawal. Other medications such as \u03b2-antagonists or neuroleptics may offer additional benefit in select patients but should not be used a monotherapy.",

Outpatients with 2 or more episodes of psychotic worsening in the past 24 months with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score of lower than 70 were randomized to 405 mg/4 weeks of olanzapine LAI (n = 264) or 10 mg/d of oral olanzapine (n = 260) for 2 years of open-label treatment. Dosing thereafter was flexible (150-405 mg/4 weeks of LAI vs 5-20 mg/d of oral). Primary outcome was time to all-cause discontinuation. At baseline, patients were clinically stable (mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score of 57). Seventeen percent of patients had been psychiatrically hospitalized in the previous 6 months, and 4.6% were rated nonadherent in the month before study entry. The groups did not differ significantly in median time to all-cause discontinuation (645 days for LAI, 678 days for oral; P = 0.61), discontinuation rate (53.8% for LAI, 51.2% for oral; P = 0.60), or relapse rate (20.1% for LAI, 18.5% for oral; P = 0.66). Postbaseline psychiatric hospitalization rate was low for both groups (7.6% for LAI, 9.2% for oral), but mean hospitalization duration was significantly longer for oral patients (1.80 days [20 for those hospitalized] vs 0.43 days [6 for those hospitalized], P = 0.02). There were no clinically significant group differences in adverse events or safety measures. No post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome events occurred. In conclusion, olanzapine LAI and oral olanzapine were similarly effective and well tolerated for up to 2 years of treatment in patients with schizophrenia. Treatment discontinuation for olanzapine LAI was similar to that of oral olanzapine, despite the 3-hour post-injection observation period and other precautionary procedures related to risk of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome.",

    "80": "Delirium is frequent in hospitalized elderly. Treatment of the medical problems causing delirium is paramount. Mostly antipsychotics are used for treatment of psychological and behavioral symptoms in delirium. Increased mortality of elderly and demented patients receiving antipsychotics suggests caution in prescribing antipsychotics for delirium. Standard treatment is low-dose haloperidol. If more sedation is needed, melperone or pipamperone can be used. In delirious Parkinsonian patients or if dementia with Lewy-bodies is suspected quetiapine is better tolerated. Other sedating antipsychotics like prothipendyl, promethazine or levomepromazin are considered inappropriate medication in the elderly due to their anticholinergic and orthostatic side effects. Cholinesterase inhibitors are not effective in delirium, except physostigmine for treatment of anticholinergic intoxication confined to intensive care. Benzodiazepines are effective in alcohol- und benzodiazepine-withdrawal, but may induce delirium (paradox reaction). Clomethiazole is contraindicated in frequent pulmonal conditions in the elderly like COPD. Chloral hydrate is considered inappropriate medication in the elderly due to QTc-prolongation.

Modern necessities and problems evoke questions about what medications can be safely utilized by a breastfeeding mother and which procedures she may safely undergo. Planning elective surgery for a patient who is breastfeeding is a challenge because of insufficient studies regarding medication safety, apprehension among patients, and inadequate information from care providers. Nonetheless, information on the pharmacokinetics of drugs in the maternal system, the possible adverse effects to the infant, and how to minimize drug exposure to the infant is easily accessible to both patients and their surgeons. Positively informed providers and breastfeeding mothers who elect to undergo surgery, willing to take the proper steps and precautions, ensure healthy outcomes postoperatively.",

Orexin signaling is thus an exciting potential therapeutic target for disorders of sleep, feeding, addiction, and stress.", 
    "88": "Here, we investigated the low dose pharmacology of orexin receptor antagonist, SB-649868, on neuroendocrine, sympathetic nervous system, and behavioral responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemic stress, in 24 healthy male subjects (aged 18-45 years; BMI 19.0-25.9 kg/m(2)), using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design. Alprazolam, a licensed benzodiazepine anxiolytic, was used as a positive comparator, as it has previously been validated using the insulin tolerance test (ITT) model in humans.", 
    "89": "Of the primary endpoints, ITT induced defined increases in pulse rate, plasma cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone in the placebo condition, but these responses were not significantly impacted by alprazolam or SB-649868 pre-treatment. Of the secondary endpoints, ITT induced a defined increase in plasma concentrations of adrenaline, noradrenaline, growth hormone (GH), and prolactin in the placebo condition. Alprazolam pre-treatment significantly reduced the GH response to ITT (p\u2009<\u20090.003), the peak electromyography (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and galvanic skin response (GSR, p\u2009=\u20090.04) to acoustic startle, the resting GSR (p\u2009=\u20090.01), and increased appetite following ITT (p\u2009<\u20090.0005). SB-649868 pre-treatment produced no significant results.",

Olanzapine is known as an atypical antipsychotic agent, but it has been reported to be effective in treating refractory CINV due to its broad and potent inhibitory activity at multiple receptors involved in the nausea and vomiting pathways. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of olanzapine for the prevention of CINV after moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy. After a search of Medline (Ovid), PubMed, CNKI, Wanfang and Weipu from 1990 to October 2013, all randomised controlled trials of olanzapine for the prevention of CINV were included in this study. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0.19 software. 6 studies involving 726 total patients were included, of which 441 were Chinese oncology patients. We found that for both general populations and Chinese populations, antiemetic regimens including olanzapine are more effective at reducing CINV than regimens that do not include olanzapine, especially in the delayed phase of CINV.",

BUP/naloxone (NLX) has been marketed as maintenance treatment, aiming at preventing opiate addicts from self-injecting crushed pills. However, to date, BUP/NLX benefits in comparison to BUP alone remain debated. We investigated the plethysmography effects of BUP/NLX in comparison to BUP/solvent administered by intravenous route in naive and BUP-tolerant Sprague-Dawley rats, and in combination with diazepam (DZP) or its solvent. In naive rats, BUP/NLX in comparison to BUP significantly increased respiratory frequency (f, P<0.05) without altering minute volume (VE). In combination to DZP, BUP/NLX significantly increased expiratory time (P<0.01) and decreased f (P<0.01), tidal volume (VT, P<0.001), and VE (P<0.001) while BUP only decreased VT (P<0.5). In BUP-tolerant rats, no significant differences in respiratory effects were observed between BUP/NLX and BUP. In contrast, in combination to DZP, BUP/NLX did not significantly alter the plethysmography parameters, while BUP increased inspiratory time (P<0.001) and decreased f (P<0.01) and VE (P<0.001). In conclusion, differences in respiratory effects between BUP/NLX and BUP are only significant in combination with DZP, with increased depression in naive rats but reduced depression in BUP-tolerant rats. However, BUP/NLX benefits in humans remain to be determined.",

The present study was carried on to investigate the effect of three Second Generation Antipsychotics (SGAs) and Haloperidol on insight and the associations among different clusters of symptoms and insight. Fifty-five patients have been recruited at the moment of pharmacological switch needed for psychotic exacerbation, from other antipsychotic drugs to Olanzapine, Aripiprazole, Ziprasidone and Haloperidol. Patients have been followed for 6 months and evaluated at baseline, after 3 months and after 6 months. Regarding the insight improvement, all SGAs resulted more effective than Haloperidol, while no difference was detected among different SGAs. Concerning psychopathology, all SGAs showed a better efficacy than Haloperidol, positive symptoms apart. All SGAs showed a similar efficacy on all domains, except for negative symptoms which resulted less responsive to ziprasidone and haloperidol. An association between improvement of insight and psychopathology was detected. Furthermore, insight appears to be related to psychopathology severity, particularly to negative symptoms. However, the observed different effectiveness of Ziprasidone on negative symptoms and insight suggests that these psychopathological features may be not strictly related and, thus, they may be sustained by different psychopathological processes.",

    "95": "While the use of creatine in human pregnancy is yet to be fully evaluated, its long-term use in healthy adults appears to be safe, and its well documented neuroprotective properties have recently been extended by demonstrations that creatine improves cognitive function in normal and elderly people, and motor skills in sleep-deprived subjects. Creatine has many actions likely to benefit the fetus and newborn, because pregnancy is a state of heightened metabolic activity, and the placenta is a key source of free radicals of oxygen and nitrogen. The multiple benefits of supplementary creatine arise from the fact that the creatine-phosphocreatine [PCr] system has physiologically important roles that include maintenance of intracellular ATP and acid-base balance, post-ischaemic recovery of protein synthesis, cerebral vasodilation, antioxidant actions, and stabilisation of lipid membranes. In the brain, creatine not only reduces lipid peroxidation and improves cerebral perfusion, its interaction with the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor is likely to counteract the effects of glutamate excitotoxicity - actions that may protect the preterm and term fetal brain from the effects of birth hypoxia. In this review we discuss the development of creatine synthesis during fetal life, the transfer of creatine from mother to fetus, and propose that creatine supplementation during pregnancy may have benefits for the fetus and neonate whenever oxidative stress or feto-placental hypoxia arise, as in cases of fetal growth restriction, premature birth, or when parturition is delayed or complicated by oxygen deprivation of the newborn.",

A descriptive correlational design utilizing chart review and a convenience sample of 100 participants was used. Fifty charts of patients hospitalized prior to the implementation of the calorie-restricted diet for those receiving atypical antipsychotic agents were compared to 50 charts of patients who received the diet. Weight changes in the two groups were compared relative to age, gender, length of time taking the medication, and the type of medication. The Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's rank-correlation coefficient, and the two-way analysis of variance were used to conduct the analyses. The calorie-restricted diet was not significantly associated with a reduction in weight gain in participants who received any of the atypical antipsychotic agents except for olanzapine; therefore, findings indicate that the calorie-restricted diet may only be effective for patients receiving olanzapine.", 
    "100": "In this study, we examine the relationship between the physical structure and dissolution behavior of olanzapine (OLZ) prepared via hot-melt extrusion in three polymers [polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, polyvinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate (PVPVA) 6:4, and Soluplus\u00ae (SLP)]. In particular, we examine whether full amorphicity is necessary to achieve a favorable dissolution profile. Drug\u2013polymer miscibility was estimated using melting point depression and Hansen solubility parameters. Solid dispersions were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. All the polymers were found to be miscible with OLZ in a decreasing order of PVP>PVPVA>SLP. At a lower extrusion temperature (160\u00b0C), PVP generated fully amorphous dispersions with OLZ, whereas the formulations with PVPVA and SLP contained 14%-16% crystalline OLZ. Increasing the extrusion temperature to 180\u00b0C allowed the preparation of fully amorphous systems with PVPVA and SLP. Despite these differences, the dissolution rates of these preparations were comparable, with PVP showing a lower release rate despite being fully amorphous. These findings suggested that, at least in the particular case of OLZ, the absence of crystalline material may not be critical to the dissolution performance. We suggest alternative key factors determining dissolution, particularly the dissolution behavior of the polymers themselves.",

Insulin, a peptide hormone has been reported to have key functions in the brain and in alleviating several psychological impairments, occur as a consequence of diabetes. However, its effects in diabetes-induced anxiety are scanty. The present study examined whether; insulin can reverse the anxiety-like behavior in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in mice. After 8-weeks of diabetes induced by STZ (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)), mice were given insulin (1-2 IU/kg/day, i.p.)/ diazepam (1 mg/kg/day, i.p.)/ vehicle for 14 days and evaluated for behavioral effects in three validated models of anxiety viz. elevated plus maze (EPM), light-dark (L/D) and hole board (HB) tests. STZ-induced diabetic mice elicited significant behavioral effects which include, decreased percentage open arm entries and time in EPM, reduced latency and time spent in light chamber in L/D, decreased number of head dips, squares crossed and rearings in HB tests respectively. Insulin treatment attenuated the behavioral effects evoked by STZ-induced diabetes in mice as indicated by increased open arms activity in EPM, decreased aversion in light chamber during L/D test and increased exploratory behavior in HB test. In conclusion, this study revealed that insulin can reverse anxiety-like behavior in STZ-induced diabetes in mice.",

As expected, we showed that chronic treatment with YL-IPA08 [N-ethyl-N-(2-pyridinylmethyl)-2-(3,4-ichlorophenyl)-7-methylimidazo [1,2-a] pyridine-3-acetamide hydrochloride], a potent and selective TSPO ligand synthesized by our institute, caused significant suppression of enhanced anxiety and contextual fear induced in the inescapable electric foot-shock-induced mouse model of PTSD and the time-dependent sensitization (TDS) procedure. These effects were completely blocked by the TSPO antagonist PK11195. Furthermore, YL-IPA08 could increase the level of allopregnanolone in the prefrontal cortex and serum of post-TDS rats, and these effects were antagonized by PK11195. In summary, the findings from the current study showed that YL-IPA08, a potent and selective TSPO ligand, had a clear anti-PTSD-like effect, which might be partially mediated by binding to TSPO and the subsequent synthesis of allopregnanolone.",

Moreover, rapid turnover time dictates the need for rapid onset of effect and rapid recovery.

Disadvantages are a rather slow onset and recovery. Bradycardia and hypotension are common. Ketamine got renewed attention mainly by nonanaesthesiologists performing procedural sedation. Psychogenic adverse effects and slow recovery limit its use. Psychiatrists are interested in its antidepressive effect. Ketamine has a potential role in lowering the risk of chronification of pain, modified by analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.

A number of acidic compounds, namely drug glucuronides (e.g. conjugates of temazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, morphine, testosterone, epitestosterone, 5-\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone, androsterone, p-nitrophenol, and paracetamol) were successfully derivatized with tris(trimethoxyphenyl) phosphoniumpropylamine to introduce a quaternary cation functionality to the analytes. Benzodiazepine glucuronides were more specifically investigated, and following positive mode electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, average improvements to peak areas as a result of derivatization were 67-, 6-, and 7- fold for temazepam, oxazepam, and lorazepam glucuronides. Average improvements to the signal-to-noise ratios for temazepam, oxazepam, and lorazepam glucuronides were 1336-, 371- and 217-fold, respectively. The values obtained for the derivatized conjugate were also typically higher than those for the underivatized parent drug. Urine containing benzodiazepine glucuronides was also successfully derivatized. The data indicates potential for the use of charge derivatization to improve the detection of molecules with acidic functionalities by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) techniques in certain scenarios.",

Samples (500 \u03bcL each) of whole blood, plasma, serum, post-mortem blood, tissue (homogenized 1\u2009+\u20094 with water), as well as 3 g of distilled gastric contents, 1 mL of urine, or 20 mg of pulverized hair were extracted at different pH values with an diethyl ether-ethyl acetate mixture (1:1). Separation and identification were performed using LC-QTRAP with electrospray ionization in positive mode. For identification 1 scheduled multi-reaction-mode (sMRM) method with 390 transitions was developed covering benzodiazepines, Z-drugs, antidepressants, neuroleptics, opioids, new synthetic drugs, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors. For positive sMRM transitions with intensities exceeding 5000 cps, dependent scans (EPI scan collision energy, 35 eV, collision energy spread, 15 eV) were performed for library search using our in-house library. The method was developed with respect to selectivity, matrix effects, recovery, process efficiency, limit of detection, and applicability. The simple work-up procedure was suitable for all biosamples with exception of urine in respect to low concentrated analytes, which showed median recovery values of 59%. The method was selective for 130 analytes in all 8 biosamples. For 106 analytes, the limit of detection in whole blood, plasma, and serum was lower than the lowest therapeutic concentration listed in blood level lists.",

    "168": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug, whose chronic use has been associated with the development of potential adverse effects such as weight gain and cardio-metabolic disorders like hypercholesterolemia and diabetes. To circumvent these side effects, the controlled release of olanzapine is a promising approach to improve adhesion of schizophrenic patients to the treatment. An innovative strategy to prolong drug release consists of loading the drug into biodegradable polymeric lipid-core nanocapsules. In this study, particle size, polydispersity, pH, zeta potential and drug loading of olanzapine-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules were analyzed. Weight gain, biochemical parameters and antipsychotic activity were evaluated in male Wistar rats. The lipid-core nanocapsules had a mean diameter of 156 +/- 13 nm, a polydispersity index lower than 0.1, a pH value of 6.12 +/- 0.14, zeta potential of -17 +/- 2.40 mV and encapsulation efficiency close to 100%. The animals treated with olanzapine-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules showed significantly lower weight gain (63.4 +/- 19.6 g) and total cholesterol levels (66.2 +/- 3.5 g x dl(-1)), compared to those administered with free olanzapine (112.6 +/- 10.3 g and 90.4 +/- 2.4 g x dl(-1)), respectively.

    "169": "The effect of estriol, the third estrogen, was evaluated for its effect on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindling model of epileptogenesis in mice followed by evaluation on kindling-induced changes in cognitive and motor functions. Kindling was induced by once every 2 days treatment with PTZ (25 mg/kg, i.p.) for 5 weeks. The seizure severity during induction of kindling and percentage incidence of animals kindled at the end of 5 weeks was recorded. Motor function was assessed using a grip strength meter while spatial memory was assessed in a cross maze. Estriol (0.005 and 0.01 mg/kg i.p.) reduced the time for induction of kindling from 5 weeks to 3 and 2 weeks for male and female mice respectively and enhanced the percentage incidence of seizures. Clomiphene (0.9 mg/kg i.p.) delayed the development of kindling and produced anticonvulsant effects. It also partially reversed the proconvulsant effects of estriol. On grip strength test and spontaneous alternation behaviour, a significant decline was observed in kindled mice which was further reduced by pre-treatment with estriol. Both clomiphene and diazepam were unable to reverse the reduced GS of PTZ-kindled mice but enhanced the percentage alternation of such animals. The study shows that estriol has powerful proconvulsant effects. Its administration in hormone replacement therapy or other indications, thus, requires careful monitoring in patients susceptible to epileptic seizures. The anticonvulsant effects of clomiphene requires further investigations.",

TTC is responsible for severe transient left ventricular dysfunction occurring after physical or psychological stress. The major pathophysiological mechanism involved is disproportionate catecholamine secretion, which may stun the myocardium.

This was a retrospective population-based cohort study of Ontario, Canada, residents between 2003 and 2010. A validated algorithm was applied to health administrative data to identify adults aged 66 years and older with COPD. Relative risks (RRs) of several clinically important respiratory outcomes were examined within 30 days of incident benzodiazepine use compared with non-use, applying propensity score matching. New benzodiazepine users were at significantly higher risk for outpatient respiratory exacerbations (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.36-1.54) and emergency room visits for COPD or pneumonia (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.69-2.18) compared to non-users. Risk of hospitalisation for COPD or pneumonia was also increased in benzodiazepine users, but was nonsignificant (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.20). There were no significant differences in intensive care unit admissions between the two groups and all-cause mortality was slightly lower among new versus non-users. Benzodiazepines were associated with increased risk for several serious adverse respiratory outcomes among older adults with COPD. The findings suggest that decisions to use benzodiazepines in older patients with COPD need to consider potential adverse respiratory outcomes.",

We evaluated five patients (an adult and four children) whose serum CLB and DMCLB concentrations were monitored after the addition or discontinuation of STM. Four of the five patients were CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizers, and one patient was an extensive metabolizer. When the patients were taking STM (100-275 mg/day), the mean CD ratio of DMCLB increased by 82.6 to 248.5%, which was higher than when they were not using STM. The increase was dose-dependent. In contrast, the CD ratio of CLB remained stable after addition or discontinuation of STM. These data suggest that STM has the potential to inhibit CYP2C19 enzyme activity. During combination therapy with STM and CLB in patients with CYP2C19 intermediate or extensive metabolizer phenotypes, monitoring of DMCLB concentrations may be helpful in ascertaining CLB-related adverse effects.",

    "191": "Combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) constitutes a powerful tool to directly assess human cortical excitability and connectivity. TMS of the primary motor cortex elicits a sequence of TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs). It is thought that inhibitory neurotransmission through GABA-A receptors (GABAAR) modulates early TEPs (<50 ms after TMS), whereas GABA-B receptors (GABABR) play a role for later TEPs (at \u223c100 ms after TMS). However, the physiological underpinnings of TEPs have not been clearly elucidated yet. Here, we studied the role of GABAA/B-ergic neurotransmission for TEPs in healthy subjects using a pharmaco-TMS-EEG approach. In Experiment 1, we tested the effects of a single oral dose of alprazolam (a classical benzodiazepine acting as allosteric-positive modulator at \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, and \u03b15 subunit-containing GABAARs) and zolpidem (a positive modulator mainly at the \u03b11 GABAAR) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. In Experiment 2, we tested the influence of baclofen (a GABABR agonist) and diazepam (a classical benzodiazepine) versus placebo on TEPs. Alprazolam and diazepam increased the amplitude of the negative potential at 45 ms after stimulation (N45) and decreased the negative component at 100 ms (N100), whereas zolpidem increased the N45 only. In contrast, baclofen specifically increased the N100 amplitude. These results provide strong evidence that the N45 represents activity of \u03b11-subunit-containing GABAARs, whereas the N100 represents activity of GABABRs. Findings open a novel window of opportunity to study alteration of GABAA-/GABAB-related inhibition in disorders, such as epilepsy or schizophrenia.",

    "197": "Ketamine infusion was associated with significant and rapid reduction in PTSD symptom severity, compared with midazolam, when assessed 24 hours after infusion (mean difference in Impact of Event Scale-Revised score, 12.7 [95% CI, 2.5-22.8]; P =\u2009.02). Greater reduction of PTSD symptoms following treatment with ketamine was evident in both crossover and first-period analyses, and remained significant after adjusting for baseline and 24-hour depressive symptom severity. Ketamine was also associated with reduction in comorbid depressive symptoms and with improvement in overall clinical presentation. Ketamine was generally well tolerated without clinically significant persistent dissociative symptoms.", 
    "198": "This study provides the first evidence for rapid reduction in symptom severity following ketamine infusion in patients with chronic PTSD. If replicated, these findings may lead to novel approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with this disabling condition.",

    "200": "Anaphylactic shock is characterized by increased capillary permeability and a decline in blood pressure due to excessive production of IgE. Midazolam (MDZ) is reported to have immunomodulatory properties. However, little is known about the effect of MDZ on the production of IgE antibody. We examined whether MDZ can suppress antigen-specific and total IgE production followed by IgE class switch recombination (CSR). MDZ was administered intraperitoneally to mice prior to ovalbumin (OVA) plus native cholera toxin (nCT) immunization. Serum OVA-specific and total IgE responses, and surface IgE-positive B cells were analyzed by ELISA and flow cytometry. Furthermore, expression levels of CSR-associated molecules such as germ-line transcript \u03b5 (\u03b5GLT), germ-circle tanscript \u03b5 (\u03b5CT), AID, and Id2 in the spleen were compared. The levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin (IL)-4 mRNA and protein were also examined in the spleen and serum. MDZ significantly suppressed OVA-specific and total IgE levels in plasma and surface IgE-positive B cells in the spleen. Moreover, MDZ-treated mice had significantly reduced levels of \u03b5GLT and \u03b5CT. Furthermore, although the levels of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA and protein were significantly elevated, those of IL-4 were reduced in MDZ-treated mice. Therefore, MDZ may be an important modulator of allergic responses through its ability to downregulate IgE production."
