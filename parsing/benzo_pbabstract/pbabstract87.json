    "23": "Olanzapine and other second generation antipsychotics have been associated with weight gain, which may be related to changes in appetite and food intake. However, it is unclear whether changes in appetite in response to treatment with second generation antipsychotics are persistent in patients treated chronically with these medications and the extent to which changes in appetite are related to any continuing weight gain associated with long-term treatment with these drugs. In a randomized 5-month study of the effects of olanzapine and risperidone on metabolic changes in chronic schizophrenic patients, we assessed appetite changes using two scales and correlated appetite changes with weight gain and metabolic changes. There is evidence that the hormone ghrelin is related to appetite stimulation and falls during satiation after meals, and therefore, may be a physiological concomitant indicating appetite changes. We therefore, also measured ghrelin before and after a fatty meal at baseline and after 2 months of drug treatment. Neither olanzapine nor risperidone increased appetite during the 5 months of study drug treatment, and there was a trend for a decrease in appetite over time. Weight only increased slightly during treatment and changes in appetite scores were not correlated with changes in weight or changes in glucose or lipids. Fasting ghrelin did not increase in olanzapine- or risperidone-treated patients, and there were no significant changes in ghrelin responses to a fatty meal between baseline and 2 months of drug treatment, and no differences in response in olanzapine- vs. risperidone-treated patients. Our findings suggest that in chronic schizophrenic patients treated with multiple antipsychotics in the past, olanzapine or risperidone do not induce increases in appetite and appetite changes are not related to any further small drug-induced weight gain in these chronically treated patients. However, it is possible that different relationships may exist between appetite and weight changes induced by the medications in drug naive patients newly started on olanzapine or risperidone.",

It is characterized by decreased oxidative metabolism and relatively increased anaerobic glycolysis. Metabolic suppressive therapy reduces the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO(2)) and the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGluc). If CMRO(2) is suppressed after SAH, withdrawal of metabolic suppressive therapy could lead to the accumulation of lactate. In this project, we assessed the relationship between the withdrawal of metabolic suppressive therapy and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate concentration. A prospective observational database containing 262 patients with SAH was retrospectively analyzed. CSF lactate levels were compared with the daily dose of metabolic suppressive therapy. Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). In 56% of patients an increase in CSF lactate (mean: 3.2 \u00b1 0.9 mmol/L) after withdrawal of metabolic suppressive therapy was observed. Mean Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) was lower in patients with an increase in CSF lactate concentration (>0.5 mmol/L) after withdrawal of metabolic suppressive therapy (p = 0.095).

We propose a new animal model using silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) exposed to an anesthetic bath to study the mechanism of action of EO. To observe the induction and potentiation of the anesthetic effect of EO, juvenile silver catfish (9.30 \u00b1 1.85 g; 10.15 \u00b1 0.95 cm; N = 6) were exposed to various concentrations of L. alba EO in the presence or absence of diazepam [an agonist of high-affinity binding sites for benzodiazepinic (BDZ) sites coupled to the GABA A receptor complex]. In another experiment, fish (N = 6) were initially anesthetized with the EO and then transferred to an anesthetic-free aquarium containing flumazenil (a selective antagonist of binding sites for BDZ coupled to the GABA A receptor complex) or water to assess recovery time from the anesthesia. In this case, flumazenil was used to observe the involvement of the GABA-BDZ receptor in the EO mechanism of action. The results showed that diazepam potentiates the anesthetic effect of EO at all concentrations tested. Fish exposed to diazepam and EO showed faster recovery from anesthesia when flumazenil was added to the recovery bath (12.0 \u00b1 0.3 and 7.2 \u00b1 0.7, respectively) than those exposed to water (9.2 \u00b1 0.2 and 3.5 \u00b1 0.3, respectively).

Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicate agents used to treat anxiety, e.g., SSRIs and benzodiazepines, attenuate amygdala, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activation during emotional processing. Our prior study has shown that during anticipation of an emotional stimulus, pregabalin attenuates amygdala and insula activation but increases medial PFC activation. In this study, we examined whether, similar to SSRIs and benzodiazepines, pregabalin attenuates amygdala, insula, and medial PFC during emotional face processing. Sixteen healthy volunteers underwent a double-blind within-subjects fMRI study investigating effects of placebo, 50 mg, and 200 mg pregabalin on neural activation during an emotional face-matching task. Linear mixed model analysis revealed that pregabalin dose-dependently attenuated left amygdala activation during fearful face-matching and left anterior insula activation during angry face-matching. The 50 mg dose exhibited more robust effects than the 200 mg dose in the right anterior insula and ventral ACC. Thus, pregabalin shares some similarity to SSRIs and benzodiazepines in attenuating anger and fear-related insula and amygdala activation during emotional face processing. However, there is evidence that a subclinical 50 mg dose of pregabalin produced more robust and widespread effects on neural responses in this paradigm than the more clinically relevant 200 mg dose. Taken together, pregabalin has a slightly different effect on brain activation as it relates to anticipation and emotional face processing, which may account for its unique characteristic as an agent for the treatment of anxiety disorders.", 
    "38": "Allosteric binding pockets in peptide-binding G protein-coupled receptors create opportunities for the development of small molecule drugs with substantial benefits over orthosteric ligands. To gain insights into molecular determinants for this pocket within type 1 and 2 cholecystokinin receptors (CCK1R and CCK2R), we prepared a series of receptor constructs in which six distinct residues in TM2, -3, -6, and -7 were reversed. Two novel iodinated CCK1R- and CCK2R-selective 1,4-benzodiazepine antagonists, differing only in stereochemistry at C3, were used. When all six residues within CCK1R were mutated to corresponding CCK2R residues, benzodiazepine selectivity was reversed, yet peptide binding selectivity was unaffected. Detailed analysis, including observations of gain of function, demonstrated that residues 6.51, 6.52, and 7.39 were most important for binding the CCK1R-selective ligand, whereas residues 2.61 and 7.39 were most important for binding CCK2R-selective ligand, although the effect of substitution of residue 2.61 was likely indirect. Ligand-guided homology modeling was applied to wild type receptors and those reversing benzodiazepine binding selectivity. The models had high predictive power in enriching known receptor-selective ligands from related decoys, indicating a high degree of precision in pocket definition. The benzodiazepines docked in similar poses in both receptors, with C3 urea substituents pointing upward, whereas different stereochemistry at C3 directed the C5 phenyl rings and N1 methyl groups into opposite orientations. The geometry of the binding pockets and specific interactions predicted for ligand docking in these models provide a molecular framework for understanding ligand selectivity at these receptor subtypes. Furthermore, the strong predictive power of these models suggests their usefulness in the discovery of lead compounds and in drug development programs.",

    "47": "GABA(A) receptor modulating drugs such as benzodiazepines (BZs) have been used to treat anxiety disorders for over five decades. In order to determine whether the same or different GABA(A) receptor subtypes are necessary for the anxiolytic-like action of BZs in unconditioned anxiety and conditioned fear models, we investigated the role of different GABA(A) receptor subtypes by challenging wild type, \u03b11(H101R), \u03b12(H101R) and \u03b13(H126R) mice bred on the C57BL/6J background with diazepam or chlordiazepoxide in the elevated plus maze and the fear-potentiated startle paradigms. Both drugs significantly increased open arm exploration in the elevated plus maze in wild type, \u03b11(H101R) and \u03b13(H126R), but this effect was abolished in \u03b12(H101R) mice; these were expected results based on previous published results. In contrast, while administration of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide significantly attenuated fear-potentiated startle (FPS) in wild type mice and \u03b13(H126R) mice, the fear-reducing effects of these drugs were absent in both \u03b11(H101R) and \u03b12(H101R) point mutants, indicating that both \u03b11- and \u03b12-containing GABA(A) receptors are necessary for BZs to exert their effects on conditioned fear responses. Our findings illustrate both an overlap and a divergence between the GABA(A) receptor subtype requirements for the impact of BZs, specifically that both \u03b11- and \u03b12-containing GABA(A) receptors are necessary for BZs to reduce conditioned fear whereas only \u03b12-containing GABA(A) receptors are needed for BZ-induced anxiolysis in unconditioned tests of anxiety. This raises the possibility that GABAergic pharmacological interventions for specific anxiety disorders can be differentially tailored.",

Secondary analysis of data collected in a multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Clinical services of academic hospitals. Participants comprised 259 persons with MDpsy, aged 18-93 years. The intervention consisted of the random allocation to 12 weeks of treatment of either olanzapine plus sertraline or olanzapine plus placebo. Demographic and clinical variables associated with overall non-completion and sub-types of non-completion of randomized treatment. One hundred and seventeen (45.2%) subjects did not complete 12 weeks of randomized treatment. In a logistic regression analysis, inpatient entry status, olanzapine monotherapy, and higher cumulative medical burden were statistically significant independent predictors of overall non-completion. In a multinomial logistic regression model that examined predictors of subtypes of non-completion, subjects who entered the study as an inpatient were less likely to complete because of inadequate efficacy as determined by the investigator, and older subjects were less likely to complete because of poorer tolerability. Subjects who were assigned to olanzapine monotherapy, younger subjects, and subjects who entered the study as inpatients were less likely to complete because of reasons other than efficacy or tolerability.

To quantify effects of a loading dose of midazolam and lidocaine on the EEG frequency spectrum of full-term neonates with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS), 11 full-term infants underwent multi-channel amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) and EEG recordings. During recording, midazolam and/or lidocaine were administered as anti-epileptic drug. Retrospectively, we performed spectral analysis on 4-h EEG segments around the loading dose.

Effects of lidocaine were more pronounced in the stroke-affected hemisphere. In conclusions, both drugs induced a shift from low to higher frequency electrocortical activity. Additionally, midazolam reduced total EEG power. These spectral changes differ from those seen in adult studies.",

Patients who elect to terminate ventilatory support may be subject to significant and even extreme respiratory symptoms. Severe dyspnea and other symptoms are sometimes treated with palliative sedation, which is generally recommended as a last resort approach to refractory symptoms. However, the preemptive use of palliative sedation is sometimes appropriate. The preemptive use of palliative sedation is examined through a case-based analysis of a patient with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

PAS consisted of electrical stimuli pairs at n.medianus and magnetic pulses over the scalp (transcranial magnetic stimulation) in precisely defined intervals (ISI was 10 and 25 ms) for a total of about 15 minutes (200 pairs). MEP amplitudes before and after (0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes later) interventional protocols were compared.", 
    "56": "When protocols were applied with placebo depending on ISI (10 ms--inhibitory, 25 ms--facilitatory effects), MEP amplitudes decreased or increased, while values in the post-interventional period (0, 10, 20 and 30 min) were compared with initial values before the use of SAS. The use of benzodiazepines caused the occlusion of LTP-like effect, in contrast to amplification effects recorded after the administration of levodopa. With respect to the LTD-like protocol, the reverse was true (ANOVA for repeat measurements p < 0.001).", 
    "57": "Administration of GABA-ergic agonist diazepam interferes with the induction of associative plasticity in the motor cortex of healthy individuals, as opposed to the use of levodopa, which stimulates these processes.

The Beers criteria identified potentially inappropriate medication use in 25% of patients and 48% of patients used at least 1 inappropriate medication according to STOPP criteria. The most frequent potentially inappropriate medications for both criteria were long-acting benzodiazepines and NSAIDs. START detected 58 potential prescribing omissions in 44% of patients.

In this article, the authors review the use of a variety of first-generation antipsychotic drugs, second-generation antipsychotic drugs, and benzodiazepines for treatment of acute agitation, and propose specific guidelines for treatment of agitation associated with a variety of conditions, including acute intoxication, psychiatric illness, delirium, and multiple or idiopathic causes. Pharmacologic treatment of agitation should be based on an assessment of the most likely cause of the agitation. If agitation results from a delirium or other medical condition, clinicians should first attempt to treat the underlying cause instead of simply medicating with antipsychotics or benzodiazepines.", 
    "87": "The fast inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and GABA are co-localized in synaptic terminals of inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord and co-released onto lumbar motoneurons in neonatal rats. We performed whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments on spinal cord preparations obtained from juvenile (P8-14) mice to determine whether inhibitory currents exhibited GABAergic components in motoneurons of animals of weight-bearing age. Subsequently we established whether or not GABA is co-released at glycinergic synapses onto motoneurons by determining if it conferred modulatory effects on the kinetics of glycinergic currents. Exponential fitting analysis showed that evoked and miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) were best-fitted with a single decay time constant. Responses recorded from connected interneuron-motoneuron pairs showed no effect of a benzodiazepine or a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. Similarly IPSCs evoked by extracellular stimulation and miniature IPSCs were not affected by either agent, indicating the absence of co-detection. Experimental manipulation of the relative content of pre-synaptic GABA and glycine conferred no effect on post-synaptic responses. It is thus unlikely that GABA is co-released in biologically relevant amounts at glycinergic synapses onto lumbar motoneurons in mice of this age.", 
    "88": "Drugs used to treat anxiety have many negative side effects including addiction, depression, suicide, seizures, sexual dysfunction, headaches and more. Anxiolytic medications do not restore normal levels of neurotransmitters but instead manipulate the brain chemistry. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) prevent the reuptake of serotonin from the synapse allowing serotonin to remain in the area of activity for a longer period of time but does not correct the lack of serotonin production. Benzodiazepines, such as Valium and Xanax\u00ae, stimulate GABA receptors, thus mimicking the calming effects of GABA but again do not fix the lack of GABA production. Often, the brain becomes accustomed to these medications and they often lose their effectiveness, requiring higher doses or different drugs. In contrast to anxiolytic drugs, there are herbs and nutrients which can stimulates neurotransmitter synthesis and more naturally effect and even adjust brain chemistry in the absence of many of the side effects experienced with drugs. Therefore this paper explores several herbal and nutritional approaches to the treatment of anxiety.",

Horses underwent surgical manipulation and injection of the palmar digital nerves; duration of the infusion was 60 minutes. Additional ketamine (0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg, IV) was administered if a horse moved its head or limbs during procedures. Cardiopulmonary and arterial blood variables were measured prior to anesthesia; at 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes during infusion; and 10 minutes after horses stood during recovery.

Heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial blood pressures, and cardiac output remained similar to preanesthetic values throughout TIVA. Arterial partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin were significantly decreased from preanesthetic values throughout anesthesia; oxygen delivery was significantly decreased at 10- to 30-minute time points. Each horse stood on its first attempt, and median recovery score was 2.",

    "135": "A variety of developmental changes is of influence on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam in neonatal and pediatric intensive care patients. However, dosing regimens in children are based upon rather empirical extrapolations from the dosing regimens in adults. Based on current available studies it appears that with the rising of age, the pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered midazolam alter, resulting in a shorter half-life due to a higher hepatic clearance in older children as compared to newborn. Also, with the rising of age, the pharmacodynamics of intravenously administered midazolam may alter due to a decrease in density of receptors, possibly leading to a decreased clinical response. These findings implicate opposite effects and it is uncertain which of these effects are predominant. In conclusion, there is a large interindividual variability in the response to midazolam in children, which may be caused by differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Both are subject to considerable developmental changes. It remains remarkable that high-quality evidence to support the use of midazolam for continuous sedation in the neonatal and pediatric intensive care setting is lacking.", 
    "136": "Sex differences in the clearance of substrates of Cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A4) have been reported frequently although there has been no consensus on reasons for variation in observations amongst drugs which are seemingly all dependent on this enzyme for their metabolism. Moreover, these observations could not be replicated in all studies even when investigating the same drugs. Differing study designs and inadequate power to identify the sex differences may explain the conflicting reports. The aim of the current study was to use in vitro data on a number of CYP3A4 substrates to develop mechanistic population pharmacokinetic models which are capable of integrating various attributes of drugs and estimating the statistical power of in vivo studies designed to discern sex differences in the clearance of CYP3A4 substrates. Midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam, nifedipine and zolpidem were selected as test substrates. These compounds are predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4, unaffected by p-glycoprotein and have abundant clinical studies which can be used for validation purposes. Simulated apparent clearance, obtained by use of the Simcyp\u00ae Population-based Simulator and in vitro in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) techniques, was compared in males and females after correcting for weight (CL/wt) in 1560 trials. Results suggested that about 105 subjects per study are required for an 80% probability of identifying a higher CL/wt in females with alprazolam, while the corresponding numbers for a similar power were 120, about 150 and 300 for nifedipine, triazolam and oral midazolam, respectively. The results were consistent with outcomes in published clinical studies and support the view that many of the published studies have inadequate power to detect these sex differences in drug clearance, thereby contributing to the lack of consensus on this subject.",

Submaximal GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents were also inhibited by piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES), 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane or imidazole. PIPES and HEPES, both piperazine derivatives, similarly inhibited GABA(A) receptors, whereas the other buffers had weaker effects and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid had no effect. HEPES-induced inhibition of submaximal GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents was unaffected by diethylpyrocarbonate, a histidine-modifying reagent. HEPES-induced inhibition of GABA(A) receptors was independent of membrane potential, HCO(3) (-) and intracellular Cl(-) concentration and was not modified by flumazenil, which blocks the benzodiazepine binding site. However, it strongly depended on pH(e) .",

The application of two scoring systems, that is, Child-Turcotte-Pugh and model for end stage liver disease, helps to estimate the risk of surgery. The use of propofol is superior to benzodiazepines as intravenous narcotics. Although enflurane and halothane are discouraged for maintenance of anesthesia, all modern volatile anesthetics appear comparable with respect to outcome.

Web sites, case reports and an epidemiological study (Swedish National Register of Adverse Drug Reactions) suggest that the drug may be abused, especially by substance-dependent individuals. Pregabalin was analyzed by LC/MS/MS following precipitation of serum proteins. Vigabatrin was used as internal standard. The concentration of 25 pg pregabalin/mL serum determined in the present case is the second highest value published so far after misuse of the substance.

Stress substantially reduced the percentage of splenocytes in the G0-G1 phase and apoptotic cells, but the percentage of S and G2-M cells and proliferation index significantly increased. Chronic administration of anxiolytic diazepam prevented the majority of the changes in the percentage of cells in different phases of the cell cycle, but apoptosis in the thymus increased under these conditions.

Among the 20 published trials, the five that were not positive, according to the FDA, showed some evidence of outcome reporting bias. However, the association between trial outcome and publication status did not reach statistical significance. Further, the apparent increase in the effect size point estimate due to publication bias was modest (8%) and not statistically significant. On the other hand, the effect size for unpublished trials (0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.39) was less than half that for the published trials (0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.54), a difference that was significant.",

All 78 inpatients with drug-na\u00efve schizophrenia were recruited from the Department of Psychology, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. They were divided into either olanzapine group (n = 49 [24 men, 25 women]; mean [standard deviation] age, 24 [6] years) or ziprasidone group (n = 29 [14 men, 15 women]; mean [standard deviation] age, 23 [7] years), all of whom were treated for 4 weeks. The serum prolactin level, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scores were measured before and at the end of treatment. RESULTS. In the olanzapine group, the respective mean (standard deviation) PANSS and CGI-S scores after the treatment (62 \u00b1 15 and 3 \u00b1 1) were significantly lower than those before the treatment (104 \u00b1 14 and 6 \u00b1 1) [p < 0.01]. In the ziprasidone group, the corresponding scores after the treatment (75 \u00b1 20 and 4 \u00b1 1) were also significantly lower than those before the treatment (104 \u00b1 17 and 6 \u00b1 1) [p < 0.01]. The decreases in mean (standard deviation) PANSS total (42 \u00b1 17) and PANSS positive scores (12 \u00b1 6) in the olanzapine group were significantly higher than those in the ziprasidone group (29 \u00b1 12 and 6 \u00b1 4, respectively) [p < 0.01]. The increase of serum prolactin in the ziprasidone female group (47 \u00b1 51 \u00b5g/L) was significantly higher than that in the ziprasidone male group (17 \u00b1 11 \u00b5g/L), the olanzapine male group (5 \u00b1 16 \u00b5g/L), and the olanzapine female group (21 \u00b1 34 \u00b5g/L) [p < 0.05]. CONCLUSIONS. Both ziprasidone and olanzapine are effective for treating drug-na\u00efve acute schizophrenia, but olanzapine was superior to ziprasidone in terms of positive and general psychopathological symptoms. In women, ziprasidone was associated with greater changes in prolactin level than olanzapine.",

In the in vitro CYP inhibition studies using erythromycin (ERM) and clarithromycin (CAM), similar inhibition responses were observed between human and DEX-female rat liver microsomes, however, there were fewer effects in intact male rats. The ex vivo study showed that midazolam (MDZ) metabolism in liver microsomes of DEX-female rats was reduced by ERM administration and the inhibitory effect was increased with increasing ERM doses, indicating that metabolite intermediate complex formation caused irreversible inhibition of CYP3A activity in DEX-female rats as well as in humans. In the in vivo studies, ERM and CAM significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of MDZ and decreased the total clearance in DEX-female rats. It was concluded that the DDIs via MBI of CYP3A following macrolide administration in humans could be reproduced in female rats, suggesting that DEX-female rats can serve as an in vivo model for assessing this DDI in humans.",

Positive screening tests were confirmed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results show that positivity rates for methamphetamines, MDMA, cocaine, and monoacetylmorphine were 1.7-, 5.7-, 3.8- and 9.3-fold higher in hair than in urine. In contrast, the detection rate for benzodiazepines was higher in urine than in hair (oxazepam, 0.21% versus 0%, nordiazepam 0.10% versus 0.03%). The positivity rate in hair for ethylglucuronide was 6-fold (12.7%) that for urine testing (2.1%). The study reveals that in the control of abstinence in the context of driving license re-granting there are in part large differences of positivity rates for some drugs or metabolites between hair and urine samples. These differences should be kept in mind by physicians and psychologists in traffic medicine who are ordering the drug testing.",

With a supported liquid-liquid extraction method, a new modification of conventional liquid-liquid-extraction, a less time intensive alternative for benzodiazepine extraction is presented. The sample pretreatment entails the derivatization of the benzodiazepines with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide plus 1% trimethylchlorosilane. Separation of all benzodiazepines was done within 9.5 min, and detection was based on full mass spectra for each analyte. A deconvolution algorithm was used for unresolved chromatographic peaks to identify coeluted substances. The subsequent quantification was done using significant masses. The limit of quantification is 10 ng/ml for most of the compounds. Linearity is in the range between 10 and 350 ng/ml.

Although these drugs have been used clinically since 1960, the molecular basis of this interaction is still not known. By using multiple homology models and an unbiased docking protocol, we identified a binding hypothesis for the diazepam-bound structure of the benzodiazepine site, which was confirmed by experimental evidence. Moreover, two independent virtual screening approaches based on this structure identified known benzodiazepine-site ligands from different structural classes and predicted potential new ligands for this site. Receptor-binding assays and electrophysiological studies on recombinant receptors confirmed these predictions and thus identified new chemotypes for the benzodiazepine-binding site.

To this end, 37 urban groundwater samples were collected in the city of Barcelona and a total of 21 drugs were analyzed including cocainics, amphetamine-like compounds, opioids, lysergics and cannabinoids and the prescribed drugs benzodiazepines. Overall, the highest groundwater concentrations (around 200 ng/L in SAP-4) and the largest number of detected DAs were found in zones basically recharged by a river that receives large amounts of effluents from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). In contrast, the urbanized areas yielded not only lower concentrations but also a much smaller number of drugs, which suggests a local origin. In fact, cocaine and its metabolite were dominant in more prosperous neighborhoods, whereas the cheaper MDMA was the dominant DA in poorer districts. Measured concentrations were consistently smaller than those estimated from the waste water fraction in groundwater samples, suggesting that DAs undergo removal processes in both reducing and oxidizing conditions.",

Here, we investigate the nitroreduction of an NBDZ, flunitrazepam (FZ), by various mutants of NfsB designed from the solved crystal structure and characterize their in vitro and in vivo potency. Conformational changes occurred in the active site of N71S/F124W in contrast to the wild-type, including the flipping on the aromatic rings of W124 and F70 as well as the extension on the hydrogen bond network between flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and S71, which allow the significant enlargement in the active site pocket. In the complex structure of N71S/F124W and nicotinamide (NIA), stacking sandwich attractions of W124-FMN-NIA were also found, implying the importance of W124 in substrate accessibility. Consequently, N71S/F124W exhibited increased 7AFZ production in vitro with nearly no toxicity and reduced 50% sleeping time (hypnosis) in vivo. Taken together, we demonstrate for the first time that N71S/F124W can serve as an effective antidote for NBDZ-induced hypnosis and provide the molecular basis for designing NfsB and the like in the future.",

We studied the spatiotemporal profile of synaptic integration and short-term plasticity in dendrites of mature cerebellar stellate cells by combining two-photon guided electrical stimulation, glutamate uncaging, electron microscopy, and modeling. Synaptic activation within thin (0.4\u00a0\u03bcm) dendrites produced somatic responses that became smaller and slower with increasing distance from the soma, sublinear subthreshold input-output relationships, and a somatodendritic gradient of short-term plasticity. Unlike most studies showing that neurons employ active dendritic mechanisms, we found that passive cable properties of thin dendrites determine the sublinear integration and plasticity gradient, which both result from large\u00a0dendritic depolarizations that reduce synaptic driving force. These integrative properties allow stellate cells to act as spatiotemporal filters of synaptic input patterns, thereby biasing their output in favor of sparse presynaptic activity.",

Individual case reports and limited case series were excluded from the analysis. This search yielded two retrospective reviews, three prospective reviews, and one randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Only two of the studies analyzed the effect of glucagon alone. Two studies combined this therapy with benzodiazepines, and the other two combined this therapy with an effervescent product and water. Of the two studies that had a control group, one demonstrated no significant difference in the success rate of dislodgement and one showed a nonsignificantly lower success rate in the treatment group. The majority of reports excluded patients with known esophageal strictures and treated a variety of different food-type impactions, making it difficult to determine if the success of this therapy may be tied to a specific subgroup. Few studies documented the adverse effects of this therapy, the most common being nausea and vomiting. Although limited, the available data do not support the use of glucagon for the relief of acute esophageal food impaction.",

A systematic review including Chinese and English literature of randomized controlled trials was conducted to examine the efficacy, safety, and composition of CHM for insomnia. Among the 217 studies we have reviewed, only eight had a Jadad score \u22653, and seven out of these eight studies had at least one domain with high risks of bias. Meta-analyses of the studies with Jadad score \u22653 found that CHM was similar to Western medication (three studies) and placebo (three studies) in treating insomnia. Due to the poor methodological quality of the studies and the small number of trials included in meta-analyses, the current evidence is insufficient to support the efficacy of CHM for insomnia. The frequency of adverse events associated with CHM was similar to that of placebo, but lower than with Western medication. Gui Pi Tang was the most commonly used standardized formula, while Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphus jujuba) was the most frequently used single herb. Further studies with a double-blind placebo-controlled design are needed to accurately determine the benefits and risks of CHM for insomnia.",

Each animal was anesthetized repeatedly over a period of three months, using an intraperitoneal combination of Fentanyl-Medetomidine and Midazolam (FMM). The time required for the animals to lose ear pinch response and the ability to perform a righting and pedal withdrawal reflex was measured. For evaluation of the clinical state, a four-point vitality scale was developed. The anesthesia was antagonized with Naloxone, Flumazenil, and Atipamezole (s.c.).",

Consistent with its weight gain liability, olanzapine significantly decreased anorexigenic POMC and increased orexigenic NPY mRNA expression in a dose-sensitive manner in the Arc. GAD(65) mRNA expression increased and CB1R binding density decreased in the Arc and DVC. Alterations to neurotransmission signals in the brain significantly correlated with body weight and adiposity. The minimum dosage threshold required to induce weight gain in the rat was 0.5 mg/kg olanzapine.",

    "187": "This study examined mechanisms by which nicotine (1.78 mg/kg base s.c.) produces discriminative stimulus effects in rhesus monkeys. In addition to nicotine, various test compounds were studied including other nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists (varenicline and cytisine), antagonists [mecamylamine and the \u03b14\u03b22 receptor-selective antagonist dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidine (DH\u03b2E)], a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist/indirect-acting catecholamine agonist (bupropion), and non-nicotinics (cocaine and midazolam). Nicotine, varenicline, and cytisine dose-dependently increased drug-lever responding; the ED(50) values were 0.47, 0.53, and 39 mg/kg, respectively. Bupropion and cocaine produced 100% nicotine-lever responding in a subset of monkeys, whereas mecamylamine, DH\u03b2E, and midazolam produced predominantly vehicle-lever responding. The training dose of nicotine resulted in 1128 ng/ml cotinine in saliva. Mecamylamine antagonized the discriminative stimulus effects of nicotine and varenicline, whereas DH\u03b2E was much less effective. Nicotine and varenicline had synergistic discriminative stimulus effects. In monkeys responding predominantly on the vehicle lever after a test compound (bupropion, cocaine, and midazolam), that test compound blocked the nicotine-discriminative stimulus, perhaps reflecting a perceptual-masking phenomenon. These results show that nicotine, varenicline, and cytisine produce discriminative stimulus effects through mecamylamine-sensitive receptors (i.e., nicotinic acetylcholine) in primates, whereas the involvement of DH\u03b2E-sensitive receptors (i.e., \u03b14\u03b22) is unclear. The current nicotine-discrimination assay did not detect a difference in agonist efficacy between nicotine, varenicline, and cytisine, but did show evidence of involvement of dopamine. The control that nicotine has over choice behavior can be disrupted by non-nicotinic compounds, suggesting that non-nicotinics could be exploited to decrease the control that tobacco has over behavior.",

This paper reviews the pharmacological treatment of SAD based on published placebo-controlled studies and published meta-analyses. It addresses three specific questions: What is the first-line pharmacological treatment of SAD? How long should treatment last? What should be the management of treatment-resistant cases? Based on their efficacy for SAD and common co-morbid disorders, tolerability and safety, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and venlafaxine should be considered the first-line treatment for most patients. Less information is available regarding the optimal length of treatment, although individuals who discontinue treatment after 12-20 wk appear more likely to relapse than those who continue on medication. Even less empirical evidence is available to support strategies for treatment-resistant cases. Clinical experience suggests that SSRI non-responders may benefit from augmentation with benzodiazepines or gabapentin or from switching to monoamine oxidase inhibitors, reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, benzodiazepines or gabapentin. Cognitive-behavioural is a well-established alternative first line therapy that may also be a helpful adjunct in non-responders to pharmacological treatment of SAD.", 
    "202": "Catamenial epilepsy is caused by fluctuations in progesterone-derived GABA(A) receptor-modulating anticonvulsant neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone, that play a significant role in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. However, there is no specific mouse model of catamenial epilepsy. In this study, we developed and characterized a mouse model of catamenial epilepsy by using the neurosteroid-withdrawal paradigm. It is hypothesized that seizure susceptibility decreases when neurosteroid levels are high (midluteal phase) and increases during their withdrawal (perimenstrual periods) in close association with GABA(A) receptor plasticity. A chronic seizure condition was created by using the hippocampus kindling model in female mice. Elevated neurosteroid levels were induced by sequential gonadotropin treatment, and withdrawal was induced by the neurosteroid synthesis inhibitor finasteride. Elevated neurosteroid exposure reduced seizure expression in fully kindled mice. Fully kindled mice subjected to neurosteroid withdrawal showed increased generalized seizure frequency and intensity and enhanced seizure susceptibility. They also showed reduced benzodiazepine sensitivity and enhanced neurosteroid potency, similar to the clinical catamenial seizure phenotype. The increased susceptibility to seizures and alterations in antiseizure drug responses are associated with increased abundance of the \u03b14 and \u03b4 subunits of GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus. These findings demonstrate that endogenous neurosteroids protect against seizure susceptibility and their withdrawal, such as that which occurs during menstruation, leads to exacerbation of seizure activity. This is possibly caused by specific changes in GABA(A) receptor-subunit plasticity and function, therefore providing a novel mouse model of human perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy that can be used for the investigation of disease mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches.",

These data raise the possibility that NK1 receptor antagonists could be potential anxiolytic treatments in humans. We evaluated this hypothesis clinically using the NK1 antagonist L-759274. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, multicentre, proof-of-concept trial. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder were randomized 1:1:1 to 6 wk of treatment with 40 mg L-759274 (n = 73), 1-6 mg lorazepam (n = 69) or placebo (n = 71).

    "224": "The neural circuitry of fear likely underlies anxiety and fear-related disorders such as specific and social phobia, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The primary pharmacological treatments currently utilized for these disorders include benzodiazepines, which act on the GABAergic receptor system, and antidepressants, which modulate the monamine systems. However, recent work on the regulation of fear neural circuitry suggests that specific neuropeptide modulation of this system is of critical importance. Recent reviews have examined the roles of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis neuropeptides as well as the roles of neurotrophic factors in regulating fear. The present review, instead, will focus on three neuropeptide systems which have received less attention in recent years but which are clearly involved in regulating fear and its extinction. The endogenous opioid system, particularly activating the \u03bc opioid receptors, has been demonstrated to regulate fear expression and extinction, possibly through functioning as an error signal within the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray to mark unreinforced conditioned stimuli. The cholecystokinin (CCK) system initially led to much excitement through its potential role in panic disorder. More recent work in the CCK neuropeptide pathway suggests that it may act in concordance with the endogenous cannabinoid system in the modulation of fear inhibition and extinction. Finally, older as well as very recent data suggests that neuropeptide Y (NPY) may play a very interesting role in counteracting stress effects, enhancing extinction, and enhancing resilience in fear and stress preclinical models. Future work in understanding the mechanisms of neuropeptide functioning, particularly within well-known behavioral circuits, are likely to provide fascinating new clues into the understanding of fear behavior as well as suggesting novel therapeutics for treating disorders of anxiety and fear dysregulation."
