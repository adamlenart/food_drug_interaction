    "0": "Two patients were hospitalized in moderately deep coma after ingestion of large doses of diazepam with suicidal intent. Three other patients required unusually high diazepam doses for therapeutic reasons (acute alcohol withdrawal, severe tetanus). In all patients, plasma levels of diazepam and its main active metabolite, desmethyl-diazepam, could be determined. The elimination of both substances seems to be dose-independent. Rapid clinical recovery after high diazepam doses is not attributable to rapid elimination of active compounds from the body, but more likely to adaptation or tolerance to their depressant effects. On the other hand, prolonged coma after long-term therapy with high doses is possible.", 
    "1": "The binding of diazepam, phenytoin and valproic acid to serum proteins in vitro has been compared in pregnant women of different gestational ages and in controls. The unbound fraction of each of three drugs was elevated during pregnancy (particularly during the last 8 weeks) probably due, at least in part, to a fall in serum albumin concentration. These findings may provide a partial explanation for the increase in the clearance of certain drugs during pregnancy and need to be taken into account when interpreting serum drug levels in clinical practice.", 
    "2": "This paper deals with the action of Clonazepam on Penicillin induced interictal discharges. In 7 rabbits Penicillin was applied epicortically in a concentration of 25,000 or 50,000 I.U. The intracortical recordings were made with an 8 fold electrode, made by thin-film technology. Clonazepam (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) was given intravenously 30 to 45 min after the Penicillin application. Under Clonazepam the occurrence of double-und multiple interictal discharge is abolished. Single spikes become shorter and are significantly reduced in amplitude. Current Source-Density analysis showed that the configuration of sources and sinks is not altered under the action of this drug. However the spatio-temporal distribution is reduced drastically. If the shape of interictal spikes is compared by means of averaging technique before and after the application of Clonazepam, one observes a significant decrease in the standard deviation. These results indicate that excitatory processes are reduced by an enhancement of inhibitory phenomena within the cerebral cortex.", 
    "3": "The effect of high concentrations of desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ), the major metabolite of diazepam (DZ), on parent drug kinetics was evaluated in six healthy young subjects who received a single intravenous dose (10 mg) of DZ on two occasions. The first DZ dose was given in the drug-free control condition and the second after the subject had ingested clorazepate (CZP), a precursor of DMDZ (15 mg daily for 7 days before DZ and then during the second DZ study). Maximum DMDZ concentration after the first DZ dose did not exceed 66 ng/ml, whereas mean DMDZ levels (derived from CZP) during the second DZ study were 481 +/- 61.5 ng/ml (SE) for all subjects. DZ kinetic parameters for all subjects during the first and second studies were: elimination half-life (t 1/2), 43.3 +/- 5.3 and 44.9 +/- 9.7 hr; total volume of distribution (Vd), 1.26 +/- 0.10 and 1.32 +/- 0.10 l/kg; unbound Vd, 97.4 +/- 9.9 and 94.9 +/- 9.9 l/kg; clearance, 0.364 +/- 0.048 and 0.394 +/- 0.055 ml/min/kg; and unbound clearance, 28.3 +/- 4.6 and 28.3 +/- 5.0 ml/min/kg. Percent unbound DZ was 1.40 +/- 0.25% when subject plasma was spiked with DZ alone and 1.47 +/- 0.21% when subjects' plasma was spiked with 500 ng/ml DMDZ in addition to DZ. Paired analysis of the two studies in each subject revealed no difference in t 1/2, Vd, unbound Vd, clearance, or DZ protein binding in the absence or presence of DMDZ. Formation and presence of the active metabolite DMDZ had no influence on kinetic behavior of parent DZ.", 
    "4": "In a controlled randomized clinical trial the effect of the secretory inhibitors Cimetidine and pirenzepine on the visibility of the areolar gastricae in barium studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract was examined. Both drugs improved the radiological imaging of the areolar tidine reduced the amount of radiologically visible fasting gastric contents. Thus, factors other than the volume alone of gastric secretions appear to play a major role in the quality of imaging of the gastric fine relief.", 
    "5": "The effect of diethyl pyrocarbonate modification of histidine on the specific binding of [3H]diazepam and its enhancement with muscimol and (+/-)-pentobarbital was investigated. Diethyl pyrocarbonate treatment produced a dose-related inhibition of specific [3H]diazepam binding to rat brain membranes with a maximal inhibition of approximately 40% at 1 mM. Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed that diethyl pyrocarbonate, while having no effect on the affinity (Kd), decreased the binding capacity (Bmax) of diazepam from a control value of 1543 +/- 116 fmol/mg of protein to 789 +/- 79 fmol/mg of protein (mean +/- SD; P less than 0.005; n = 4). Under conditions in which approximately 40% of the diazepam binding sites were modified by diethyl pyrocarbonate treatment, the ability of muscimol and pentobarbital to enhance diazepam binding was not altered. These results suggest that a histidine residue is critical for a part (approximately 40%) of the benzodiazepine binding sites and that there may exist a heterogeneity of benzodiazepine binding sites. Furthermore, these results indicate that perhaps only a portion of the benzodiazepine binding sites are functionally coupled to the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "6": "We found that two markers of differentiation, tyrosinase (monophenol, dihydroxyphenylalanine:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.14.18.1) activity and melanin synthesis, are induced by diazepam in B16/C3 mouse melanoma cells. We also demonstrated high-affinity binding sites for [3H]diazepam in these cells by radioreceptor assay, and we visualized binding to the cell surface by fluorescence microscopy with a benzodiazepine analog conjugated to a fluorescein-labeled protein. Our studies also showed that there are differences between the binding characteristics in intact cells and in membrane fractions prepared from these cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data from membrane fractions gave a linear plot (Kd = 9.1 X 10(-8) M). With intact cells, a curvilinear Scatchard plot was obtained. This was resolved into two components defining binding sites with affinity constants of 1.7 X 10(-9) M and 4.6 X 10(-7) M. Thus, it appears that [3H]diazepam binding in intact cells is more complex than in isolated membranes. Several related benzodiazepines, including flunitrazepam, Ro-5-4864, nitrazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, Ro-5-3072, chlordiazepoxide, and clonazepam also induced melanogenesis. When these compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit [3H]diazepam binding, flunitrazepam, diazepam, and Ro-5-4864 were found to be the most effective inhibitors. These three compounds were also the most potent in inducing melanogenesis. Our results suggest that the benzodiazepines modulate cell differentiation. The presence of high-affinity binding sites in this homogeneous, easily grown cell line may provide a useful model for studies on the mechanism of action of these compounds.", 
    "7": "Chromatographic separation of aqueous brain extracts yields a peptide containing fraction which competitively inhibits 3H-diazepam binding to its receptor. An intracerebral-ventricular injection of this isolated fraction results in altered responses in pharmacological and behavioral tests which are similar to those observed when diazepam is administered in the same fashion. The most pronounced effect was obtained in the conflict test. Changes observed in other tests, such as blocking pentylenetetrazole convulsions, altering motility or reducing hyperthermia, were also consistent with the actions of diazepam. At the dose used, neither diazepam nor the brain extract altered muscular co-ordination in two ataxia evaluations. Thus, the animals' performance in the other paradigms would not be adversely influenced by immobilization side-effects. The results reported here support the notion that an endogenous factor does exist in brain which can act like the benzodiazepine drugs when tested for bioactivity in animal studies.", 
    "8": "The clinical effects of flunitrazepam and oxazepam as oral premedicants were tested in a double-blind study of 69 otorhinolaryngologic patients. Flunitrazepam had a somewhat higher sedative effect (p less than 0.10) and moderated the increase in systolic blood pressure significantly (p less than 0.005) more than did oxazepam, but as regards the other parameters tested no significant differences were found (sleep, apprehension, excitement, dizziness, emetic effect, headache, increase in heart rate, venepuncture). In some patients a profuse salivary secretion was observed despite intravenous injection of atropine just before the induction of anesthesia. Our results support earlier claims of flunitrazepam's relatively strong sedative and anxiolytic properties, but on the whole the difference in clinical effects of these benzodiazepine derivatives was not marked.", 
    "9": "A double-blind comparison between benzodiazepines and neuroleptics was carried out for 1 1/2 years on 30 schizophrenics who had hitherto continuously received neuroleptics and remained apparently in full remission for at least 3-5 years. The benzodiazepine-group had a significantly higher relapse rate than the neuroleptic-group, meaning that we cannot stop neuroleptics for these patients yet. Three possible reasons for this are (1) demand of the natural course of the illness, (2) the fact that the patients agreed to stay in therapy for so long may signify a need for therapy, (3) some of the relapses on stopping neuroleptics may be 'withdrawal psychosis' after prolonged neuroleptic therapy. If withdrawal of neuroleptics is really needed, however, it may be considered for a subgroup of female patients whose illness started after the age of 40.", 
    "10": "It has been demonstrated in experiments on rats that only the drugs of benzodiazepine structure are responsible for complete cross tolerance as regards the myorelaxant effect under application with phenazepam. Other substances such as neuroleptics (chlorpromazine, triftazin), ethanol, phenobarbital, tranquilizers of non-benzodiazepine structure (meprobamate, ataractic), and an agonist of GABA receptors, muscimol, in doses that produce myorelaxation are not capable to replace phenazepam under conditions of this drug tolerance development. Partial cross tolerance under application with phenazepam arises from the use of supposed endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine receptors, nicotinamide and inosine, as well as of the use of the GABA-mimetic calcium valproate. The mechanisms of benzodiazepine tolerance development are discussed.", 
    "11": "Experiments on rats have shown that bicuculline (2 mg/kg) and picrotoxin (2 mg/kg) abolish the anxiolytic action of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg). Bicuculline (2 and 4 mg/kg) decreases while picrotoxin transforms the sedative effect of diazepam to the anxiolytic one. Picrotoxin (2 mg/kg) reduces the sedative action of gamma-acetylenic GABA (100 mg/kg) but does not favour the manifestation of its anxiolytic effect. It is suggested that the GABA-ergic mechanisms play an important role in the sedative effect of diazepam.", 
    "12": "Flunitrazepam exhibits principally the same effects as other benzodiazepines, i.e. sedation, sleep induction, amnesia and muscle relaxation. These effects are maintained for several hours and are additive to those of other drugs, e.g. narcotic analgesics. When flunitrazepam is used in ICU patients its long duration of action and depressant influence on the respiration have to be taken into account. Therefore it is preferred in cases with severe cerebral trauma, prolonged sepsis, or tetanus requiring long-term respiratory treatment. The mean single dose is 1.0 mg and the interval between consecutive doses is, on average, 2 to 3 hours. After prolonged use of flunitrazepam, at least 24 to 48 hours are necessary for sedation and muscle relaxation to disappear to such an extent that transition from mechanical to spontaneous ventilation is possible. Severe side-effects, e.g. cardiac arrhythmias, metabolic disturbances, impairment of renal function, changes in electrolyte or acid-base balance, have not been observed. Peripheral vasodilation is common and may lead to a decrease in arterial blood pressure.", 
    "13": "Diazepam, flunitrazepam and midazolam have different pharmacokinetic properties, their biological halflives for instance, being 24 to 48 hours, 4,5 hours and 2,5 hours respectively. Moreover, the total plasma clearances calculated for these drugs resulted in 30 ml/min for diazepam, 250 ml/min for flunitrazepam and 450 ml/min for midazolam. On the other hand, all three drugs were found to have nearly the same volumes of distribution (V1: 25 l, VdSS: 80-100 l). A tissue binding of over 90% of the drugs applied can further be computed from their high plasmaprotein binding action and their volumes of distribution. Of the 3 benzodiazepines investigated, diazepam reveals extremely complex pharmacokinetic effects which vary the duration of pharmacological responses very widely; besides drug interaction, enzyme induction and -inhibition it gives rise to the active metabolite N-desmethyl-diazepam (biological halflife 50 to 120 hours). In this respect however, the metabolic products of flunitrazepam and midazolam seem to be of minor clinical importance only. The pharmacokinetics of flunitrazepam will be presented as an example to discuss several modes of dosage.", 
    "14": "The fact that the benzodiazepines, like the neuroleptic drugs, combine with receptors makes the duration of their combination with the receptors and differences in their affinity to them a matter of great importance. Correlation between the blood levels of the drugs and the duration of their effects obtains only within certain dose limits. Barbiturates inhibit the effect of excitatory mechanisms whereas benzodiazepines enhance the effect of physiological inhibitory mechanisms. The shape of the dose response curve is greatly influenced by the so-called ceiling phenomenon. A new compound of the benzodiazepine family has been developed which holds out hope of better control on account of its pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties. As it is water-soluble local tolerance is also likely to be improved.", 
    "15": "Six patients with Nelson's syndrome were given sodium valproate with or without diazepam for 3 or 5 weeks. Initial high plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were greatly reduced by treatment and returned to high levels when treatment was stopped. Diazepam did not add significantly to the effects of sodium valproate alone. Three patients reported a decrease in the severity and frequency of headaches while on sodium valproate. In five patients abnormal skin pigmentation was reduced. Sodium valproate is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase inhibitor and it is suggested that the drug raises GABA levels in the hypothalamus and that this is responsible for the reduction in ACTH secretion. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that Nelson's syndrome is a neuroendocrine disease caused by a deficiency in the hypothalamic GABA-ergic system.", 
    "16": "Lormetazepam (1 mg) and diazepam (5 mg) were compared in a double-blind study of 100 patients with sleep disorders associated with a medical illness. Assignment to one of two treatment groups was at random. Lormetazepam had a greater hypnotic effect than diazepam in all significant variables (P less than 0.05). There was no hangover effect or other side effects with lormetazepam, which was thus superior to diazepam also in this respect (P less than 0.05).", 
    "17": "Recently, binding sites with high affinity and high specificity for the benzodiazepines have been discovered in mammalian brain. The affinity of the various benzodiazepines for these sites correlates well with the pharmacological potencies of these drugs. It is mainly for this reason that these binding sites are believed to represent the pharmacologically relevant \"benzodiazepine receptors\". Investigation of the binding of prazepam and metabolites to benzodiazepine receptors in rat brain homogenates reveals that prazepam has only a weak affinity to the receptor(s) with a KD of 1 microM. Its metabolite, descyclopropylmethyl-prazepam (= norprazepam) binds about 100 times more strongly (KD congruent to 15 nM). This shows that norprazepam which is the main pharmacokinetic metabolite (greater than 80% of all metabolites in plasma after oral administration of prazepam) is at the same time the biochemically active substance. Hydroxylation of the 7-membered ring of prazepam or norprazepam in position 3 does not lead to a marked increase in affinity. There is strong electrophysiological and biochemical evidence that the benzodiazepines potentiate GABAergic mechanisms in the CNS (GABA is the major inhibitory transmitter in brain). The molecular events by which the benzodiazepines modulate the GABA system are, however, completely unknown. Also, we do not know whether all pharmacological actions of the benzodiazepines (e.g. anxiolytic action, sedation, muscle relaxation) may be explained by the GABA-hypothesis. The existence of an endogenous substance--which binds to the benzodiazepine receptors--is still open to debate.", 
    "18": "Kainic acid (50 nmol), applied intravitreally to the eyes of chicks, produces within 6 h a loss of more than 50% of biochemical markers for cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the retina. Repeated peripheral administration of benzodiazepines, such as diazepam and clonazepam, protects from the kainate-induced loss of cholinergic and GABAergic markers in the retina. Histologically diazepam reduces the nuclear pyknosis induced by kainate particularly at the level of the amacrine cell-layer.", 
    "19": "A method is described for long-term recording of motor activity with a wrist-worn solid-state activity monitor. Movement-induced signals are integrated over predetermined periods (usually 7.5 min) and stored in the memory (1024 8-bit words) of the device. At 5-day intervals the data are transferred into a minicomputer and plotted in graph form. The technique may be used for studying the rest activity cycle and motor activity during sleep under normal life conditions. Sleep disorders and pharmacological effects on sleep can be objectified from the activity plots. Various applications in clinical medicine and in research are illustrated and discussed.", 
    "20": "Anthramycin can form a stable complex with DNA which does not dissociate upon repeated ethanol precipitations. The complex forms in less than one hour at pH 5.5. Bound anthramycin seems to be located in the minor groove of the DNA helix in the anthramycin DNA complex, since methylation of adenosine residues at N-3 by dimethylsulfate is reduced. The anthramycin-DNA complex is resistant to digestion by an excess of a number of restriction enzymes. Anthramycin can be removed from DNA by incubation at acid pH. The released DNA can then be cleaved by restriction enzymes. Anthramycin-DNA complexes can be acted upon by T4 polynucleotide ligase to form longer DNA molecules. The ability of anthramycin to form a stable but reversible complex which is not cleaved by restriction enzymes but can engage in joining reactions may allow a wider variety of DNA fragments to be more readily constructed in vitro.", 
    "21": "Seizure thresholds were determined by timed infusion of a convulsant drug. Following an electroconvulsive shock (ECS) rats exhibited a raised seizure threshold to infusion of the GABA antagonist drugs, pentylenetetrazol, bicuculline and isopropyl-bicyclophosphate, but not to the glycine antagonist strychnine or the 5-HT agonist, quipazine. The increase in threshold was seen following a bicuculline-induced seizure and 30 min following the last of a course of ECS given once daily for 10 days. The rise in seizure threshold still occurred when animals were pretreated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (200 mg . kg-1), p-chlorophenylalanine (200 mg . kg-2), naloxone (1 mg . kg-1) or indomethacin (20 mg . kg-1). Diazepam (2 mg . kg-1), flurazepam (10 mg . kg-1) and sodium valproate (400 mg . kg-1) elevated basal seizure threshold and a further rise followed the ECS. Phenytoin (40 mg . kg-1) and carbamazepine (40 mg . kg-1) had no effect on basal seizure threshold or the ECS-induce rise. (\u00bfPropranolol (20 mg . kg-1) did not affect basal seizure threshold but prevented the ECS-induced increase. The rise in seizure threshold following a convulsion may be an important adaptive mechanism which could be related to the reported increase in specific benzodiazepine binding following a seizure.", 
    "22": "Pentobarbital enhances [3H]diazepam binding to soluble receptors in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. Half-maximal enhancement occurred at 110 micrometers pentobarbital. This enhancement was due to an increase in the affinity of diazepam to its receptor sites. Pentobarbital enhancement was blocked by picrotoxinin and bicuculline. These results are similar to those reported for membranes and suggest that various components of the benzodiazepine--GABA-receptor-ionophore complex are intimately associated.", 
    "23": "Receptor binding studies were undertaken in an attempt to identify and characterize pharmacologically and functionally distinct receptor sites for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in rat brain. The results indicated that the potency of bicuculline, a GABA receptor antagonist, to displace membrane-bound [3H]GABA varies significantly among different brain regions, with the greatest potency found in the cerebral cortex and midbrain. In addition, in the presence of 50 mM ammonium thiocyanate, the potency of bicuculline to displace specifically bound [3H]GABA was increased significantly, with the magnitude of this increase being greater in some brain areas than others. The biological relevance of this thiocyanate-induced shift in the potency of bicuculline to inhibit [3H]GABA binding was indicated by the finding that ammonium thiocyanate also increased the potency of bicuculline to inhibit GABA-activated benzodiazepine receptor binding, a biochemical measure of GABA receptor function. Receptor site saturation analysis revealed that ammonium thiocyanate selectively abolished the high affinity GABA binding site without affecting either the low affinity component or GABA-activated benzodiazepine receptor binding. These findings provide further evidence for the existence of pharmacologically distinct GABA receptor sites, with some being more sensitive to the blocking action of bicuculline than others. Furthermore, the data provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis that only low affinity GABA receptor sites are linked to the benzodiazepine receptor, indicating that the kinetically different GABA binding sites are also functionally distinct. The discovery that ammonium thiocyanate selectively destroys high affinity GABA receptor binding may be useful for further defining the pharmacological, biochemical, and functional differences between GABA receptors in brain.", 
    "24": "A method for determination of benzodiazepines in human blood, plasma, saliva and urine has been developed. The method is based upon the competition between 3H-flunitrazepam and biologically active benzodiazepines in biological fluids for brain specific receptors, prepared in a stable, dry form and easy to handle. The pharmacological specificity for benzodiazepines of the dry stable receptor preparation is closely similar to that of fresh membrane-bound rat brain receptors. The method is specific for biologically active benzodiazepines; it is relatively rapid, sensitive and reproducible, and can be performed at room temperature.", 
    "25": "Emotional and cognitive reactions to four different patient package inserts (PPIs) describing flurazepam were tested. All documents contained the same basic information. However, this information was presented in a frank manner to half the subjects and in a reassuring manner to the other half. In addition, in both cases, drug side effects were presented either as a list or in paragraph form. Study subjects--456 members of a college community--each read one of the PPIs and then completed a self-administered questionnaire that had 10 multiple-choice questions about flurazepam and 19 scaled questions focusing on semantics. The frank version was judged clearer, more interesting, longer, and more appropriate for an adult audience. Tone also affected which items of information in the PPI were remembered best, possibly because it helped to establish which information was considered most important. Caution should be observed in generalizing the study conclusions until they are corroborated by research on a wider patient population.", 
    "26": "The efficacy of gastric lavage as it is practiced in a major metropolitan hospital was evaluated. From a population of 76 patients with chemical evidence of sedative-hypnotic drugs in the blood, two or more therapeutic doses were recovered from 15.8% of the lavage samples, and 10 or more therapeutic doses were recovered from 6.6%. In a population consisting of patients with detectable quantities of drugs in the lavage sample, diazepam and amitriptyline are more adequately recovered than the sedative-hypnotic drugs. Very poor recoveries were obtained in patients lavaged more than 2 h after ingestion except in cases of amitriptyline overdose or massive sedative-hypnotic ingestion. The study indicates that inadequate criteria are employed in selecting patients most likely to benefit from lavage. Dose, time since ingestion, and symptomatology are discussed as criteria for selection of patients for lavage.", 
    "27": "A 16-year-old body with stiff-man syndrome is described because the condition rarely occurs in this age group. Diagnosis, by appropriate electrodiagnostic studies, is important because stiff-man syndrome is easily treated with high doses of diazepam.", 
    "28": "This retrospective study reports on ten years' experience of general anesthesia in ophthalmosurgery (4080 cases) at the General Hospital in Linz, Austria. The majority of patients in ophthalmosurgery are infants, children and geriatric patients confronting the anesthesiologist with specific problems. Anesthesiologic techniques and complications are discussed. Cooperation and continuous qualified anesthesiologic care are essential for good results. In bulb-opening procedures Valium-Neuroleptanalgesia is preferred, as it involves less stress, especially for the geriatric patient, and insures optimal operating conditions for the ophthalmologist. In the Linz General Hospital general anesthesia has become the method of choice in eye surgery.", 
    "29": "Antimetrazol and muscle-relaxant activities of 11 aliphatic esters of oxazepam were studied as a function of time in mice. The esters given intravenously retained antimetrazol activity, while muscle-relaxant activity was generally decreased. The administration of a dose equivalent to the antimetrazol ED50 resulted in constant oxazepam brain levels for most esters; therefore, the intrinsic anticonvulsant activity of the intact ester is insignificant. The dimethylphenylpropionyl ester appeared to antagonize the effect of oxazepam, since it elevated the free oxazepam level required to achieve the ED50 in the antimetrazol assay. The administration of doses equivalent to the muscle-relaxant ED50 values resulted in no correlation with total brain benzodiazepine levels, suggesting that changes in the selectivity of action are the consequence of different sites of action.", 
    "30": "A double-blind triple cross-over trial was designed for 21 patients suffering from tinnitus; mexiletine, diazapam, betahistine and placebo were taken each for a month sequentially during which time the patients recorded their tinnitus loudness subjectively on a visual analogue scale. The results showed that these medications did not influence the tinnitus loudness. Since mexiletine is an oral analogue of lignocaine and a cardiovascular drug, any untoward cardiovascular history and clinical finding disqualified such patients from the trial. Twenty-one such patients were rejected from an original group of 42 patients. In a volunteer trial mexiletine unrelated to this, it was reported that a vasovagal attack was suffered by someone who had just consumed 400 mg mexiletine orally. After ethical considerations the tinnitus trial was stopped. Eleven patients completed the cycle of medications, 10 did not. The dangers of using a cardiovascular drug for a non-cardiovascular condition is thus exposed.", 
    "31": "The influence of antituberculosis drugs on diazepam disposition was assessed in a series of volunteers and patients who received single intravenous doses of diazepam. In study 1, nine healthy subjects received diazepam in the drug-free control state and again during treatment with isoniazid (INH), 180 mg/day. INH did not alter diazepam volume of distribution (Vd) or protein binding, but prolonged mean elimination half-life (t1/2) from 34 to 45 hr (p less than 0.02), and reduced total clearance from 0.54 to 0.40 ml/min/kg (p less than 0.02). In study 2, diazepam disposition in a group of seven tuberculous patients on triple therapy with INH, ethambutol (EMB), and rifampin (RIF) was compared with that in healty drug-free controls matched for age and sex. Diazepam Vd and protein binding were nearly identical between groups, but mean t1/2 among patients (14 hr) was significantly shorter than in controls (58 hr, p less than 0.01) and total clearance correspondingly increased (to 1.50 from 0.37 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.01). Study 3 compared six newly diagnoses tuberculous patients receiving initial therapy with EMB alone with age- and sex-matched controls. Diazepam unbound fraction in patients tended to be higher than in controls, and diazepam Vd and clearance tended to be lower but the differences were not statistically significant. Thus, diazepam clearance is impaired and t1/2 prolonged by administration of INH alone. Markedly increased clearance and shortened t1/2 in triple-therapy patients is probably due to enzyme-inducing effects of RIF. Dosage of diazepam may require adjustment in patients with tuberculosis on chemotherapy.", 
    "32": "The behavioral and electroencephalographic effects of alprazolam and its metabolites were investigated in mice, rats and rabbits, and compared with the data on diazepam, lorazepam and nitrazepam. Locomotor activity of mice in an open-field situation was increased with smaller doses of alprazolam and nitrazepam but not with diazepam and lorazepam. Alprazolam increased the hyperactivity induced by methamphetamine in mice. The anticonflict effects of alprazolam in rats were more potent than those of diazepam and lorazepam. In suppressing hyperemotionality and muricide of olfactory bulbectomized rats, alprazolam was more potent than diazepam and fairly equal to that of lorazepam. Muricide of raphe-lesioned rats was markedly inhibited by alprazolam. Mescaline-induced head-twitches in mice were more markedly increased with alprazolam than with nitrazepam and diazepam. Alprazolam, diazepam and lorazepam prevented both maximal electroshock and pentetrazol convulsions in mice. Alprazolam was more potent than diazepam and lorazepam in potentiating thiopental, ether and ethanol anesthesia in mice. In the impaired rotarod performance, alprazolam was more potent than diazepam and lorazepam in mice, but was much less potent than diazepam and lorazepam in mice, but was much less potent than lorazepam in rats. In conscious rabbits with chronically implanted electrodes, alprazolam induced a drowsy EEG pattern and depressed the EEG arousal response not only to auditory stimulation but also to mesencephalic reticular stimulation. The EEG effect of alprazolam was approx. twice that of diazepam. The pharmacological activity of alpha-hydroxyalprazolam was approx. one third that of alprazolam. However, 5-chloro-2-(3-hydromethyl-5-methyl-4H-1, 2,4-triazolo-4-yl) benzophenone showed no pharmacological activity. These results indicate that alprazolam possesses pharmacologic properties characteristic to benzodiazepines and that the activity is more potent than diazepam. In addition, alprazolam seems to have a specific effect on the central serotonergic mechanisms.", 
    "33": "The cardiovascular and respiratory responses to a combination of diazepam and methohexital (D-M) were compared to those from a combination of diazepam, fentanyl, and methohexital (D-F-M). Both caused significant tachycardia after administration and during surgery. The D-F-M combination caused a significant decrease in both respiration rate and oxygen saturation. Surgeons preferred this combination for the production of sedation and cooperation of patients. Comparison of efficacy to toxicity suggests that the increase in patient cooperation for the D-F-M combination is at the expense of respiratory depression. The use of oxygen supplementation and monitoring of respiration is recommended during the use of the combination.", 
    "34": "The extent of plasma protein binding of diazepam (DZ) and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ), was determined by equilibrium dialysis in plasma samples drawn from 62 nonfasting unheparinized volunteers aged 20 to 85 years. The free fraction for diazepam averaged 1.48 per cent (range 0.85 to 2.30 per cent) and increased with age (r = 0.33). Desmethyldiazepam also was extensively bound. The mean free fraction was 2.97 per cent (range 1.78 to 5.28 per cent) and increased with age (r = 0.27). Free fractions for both diazepam and desmethyldiazepam were negatively correlated with plasma albumin concentration (r = --0.17 and --0.39). However, age, sex, and albumin explained only a small proportion of variability in free fraction for either compound. Free fraction for desmethyldiazepam always exceeded that for diazepam, and the two were correlated (r = 0.32). Thus, at any given total plasma concentration, the unbound concentration of desmethyldiazepam will exceed that of diazepam.", 
    "35": "Studies of impulse summation in the rabbit central nervous system have shown that valproate, an agent potentiating GABA-ergic inhibition, reduces while thiosemicarbazide and bicuculline that lower GABA inhibitory effects increase impulse summation. It has been also discovered that the action of phenazepam and diazepam is potentiated by valproate and reduced by thiosemicarbazide and bicuculline. According to the authors' data, diphenylhydantoin, an anticonvulsant having no GABA-positive effect fails to produce selective reduction of impulse summation. The data presented may be regarded as new evidence gained in the whole body for participation of the GABA-ergic mechanisms in the development of benzodiazepine effects.", 
    "36": "The characteristics of the Na+-independent high-affinity binding of [3H]GABA to various types of crude synaptic membranes (CSM) prepared from rat brain cortex were studied. In freshly prepared CSM the content of GABA was so high that the high-affinity [3H]GABA binding could not be determined. In contrast when the frozen-thawed CSM were incubated at 37 degrees for 30 min with or without Triton X-100 or phospholipase C and then washed repeatedly, there was a virtual disappearance of GABA from the supernatant extracts and the binding constants of [3H]GABA to CSM could be determined. Two apparent populations of [3H]GABA binding sites, one with a low- and the other with a high-affinity constant, were detected. The ratio of the number of high- to low-affinity binding sites varies with the method used to prepare the membranes. The lowest value of this ratio was observed with membranes incubated at 37 degrees for 30 min. However, when frozen-thawed CSM were treated with 0.05% Triton X-100 repeatedly, the ratio of the number of high- to low-affinity binding sites increased progressively. This increase in ratio is due to a selective increase in the number of the high-affinity sites without significant changes in the number of the low-affinity sites. The extent of the increase in the number of sites that bind [3H]GABA with high affinity after repeated Triton X-100 treatments was paralleled by a decrease of an endogenous protein which inhibits GABA binding. The reapplication of this endogenous material to membranes repeatedly treated with Triton X-100 reduces the number of high-affinity binding sites for [3H]GABA to values similar to those measured in membranes that were not treated with Triton X-100. The inhibitory preparation extracted from CSM incubated with Triton X-100 was shown to be free of GABA or phospholipids. The gel filtration chromatography reveals the presence of two molecular forms of the inhibitor; of these, the high-molecular-weight material fails to bind GABA, whereas the low-molecular-weight material appears to bind GABA. The high-molecular-weight endogenous inhibitor has been termed GABA modulin.", 
    "37": "Central stimulant actions of 10 methylxanthines in mice correlate with affinities for adenosine receptors labeled with N6-[3H]cyclohexyladenosine. Affinities of methylxanthines for adenosine receptors are consonant with central levels attained at behaviorally effective doses. The much higher concentrations of methylxanthines required to influence benzodiazepine receptor binding do not correlate with behavioral potency. N6-(L-Phenylisopropyl)adenosine (L-PIA), a metabolically stable analog of adenosine with high affinity for adenosine receptors, is an extremely potent behavioral depressant, reducing locomotor activity of mice at doses as little as 0.05 mumol/kg. The D isomer, which has much less affinity for adenosine receptors, is much less active as a central depressant. Theophylline stimulates locomotor activity and reverses depressant effects of L-PIA. Caffeine or 1,7-dimethylxanthine, when administered alone, elicits biphasic effects, with locomotor depression at lower doses and stimulation at higher doses. When administered with L-PIA, even low doses of caffeine produce marked stimulation. 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine given alone elicits only behavioral depression. However, like theophylline and caffeine, isobutylmethylxanthine reverses the L-PIA-evoked depression, converting it into pronounced locomotor stimulation. The data strongly suggest that the behavioral stimulant effects of methylxanthines involve a blockade of central adenosine receptors.", 
    "38": "Nicotinamide (NAM, 1000 mg/kg), inosine (INS, 1000 mg/kg), hypoxanthine (HXT, 500 mg/kg), putative endogenous ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor, and nicotinic acid (NA, 500 mg/kg) diminished DL-kynurenine-(DL-K, 50 micrograms ICV) induced seizures in C57BL/6 adult male mice and only prolonged the latency of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 500 micrograms iCV) seizures. The same effect was previously observed when PTZ was administered IP. In albino male BALB/c and SHR (bred from Swiss) mice only NA was effective against DL-K. Diazepam in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg prevented PTZ-induced seizures in half of the animals but even in dose of 10 and 20 mg/kg it was ineffective against DL-K. When injected ICV NAM (1 and 10 micrograms), INS (10 micrograms) and HXT (10 micrograms) prevented seizures induced by DL-K and were ineffective against seizures induced by PTZ. It is suggested that if NAM, INS and HXT are of functional importance in the central nervous system, they can act as antagonists of endogenous brain kynurenine. NA and NAM are suggested to be functional feedback inhibitory regulators of the kynurenine pathway of metabolism of tryptophan.", 
    "39": "The synthesis of a series of 6-(substituted-phenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazines (VIII) is reported. Some of these derivatives show activity in tests predictive of anxiolytic activity [(a) protection against pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions; (b) thirsty rat conflict procedure]. They also represent a new class of compound which inhibits [3H]diazepam binding. Structure--activity correlations, as well as the ability of structures VIII to inhibit [3H]diazepam binding (in vitro), are discussed.", 
    "40": "The relation between plasma concentrations and properties of lorazepam administered orally as premedication was studied in patients undergoing minor surgery. The drug was found to be reliably absorbed in most subjects producing plasma concentrations similar to those reported after injection. Effective concentrations were obtained within 30-60 min, maintained for 4-6 h and were closely related to the action of the drug on memory and its sedative and anxiolytic properties. Its kinetics were described in about half of the subjects by a one-compartment model, but in others two compartments were required. Variable half-lives were found (range 9.3-32.1 h, mean about 20 h). Sufficient drug remains after 24 h to suggest that residual c.n.s. effects may still be present.", 
    "41": "Temazepam is a benzodiazepine drug which is a minor metabolite of diazepam. In clinical studies using subjective evaluation methods it was effective for maintaining sleep and increasing total sleep time. However, sleep laboratory studies did not show a significant effect on some sleep parameters, especially sleep induction. Temazepam has a relatively short half-life (about 5 to 11 hours, longer in some subjects and in the elderly), and no active metabolites of clinical importance, and thus may be considered more suitable for use as an hypnotic than longer acting drugs such as diazepam, nitrazepam or flurazepam when residual sedative effects the next day are not desirable. Indeed, few residual effects on morning performance appear to occur with usual single doses of temazepam, although at the upper end of the recommended dosage range (30 mg or more) some evidence of impaired psychomoter and cognitive function in the morning has been reported. Whether or not temazepam is likely to produce \"hangover\" with repeated night-time administration needs further clarification. While a call for a large number of controlled trials may not be justifiable in evaluating a new hypnotic, a few well designed additional comparative studies in insomniac subjects are needed to assess adequately the relative merits of temazepam (particularly with regard to sleep onset) compared with other benzodiazepine hypnotics, especially those which are short- or intermediate-acting.", 
    "42": "The effects of some antipileptic drugs on the level of GABA in the mouse brain was studied using standardized chromatographic methods. Diphenylhydantoin and carbamazepine determined a marked increase of the cerebral GABA level, whereas phenobarbital, diazepam a,d clonazepam were without effect. The results seem to indicate that diphenyihydantoin and carbamazepine, by increasing the GABA level, may act through an enchancement of the GABA-ergic transmission.", 
    "43": "Possible involvement of prostaglandins (PG) in the antimyoclonic action of clonazepam was examined in the p,p'-DDT-animal model of myoclonus. PG synthesis inhibitors and the PG antagonist polyphloretin phosphate (PPP) counteracted the antimyoclonic action of clonazepam in mice. PGE2 reduced DDT-induced myoclonus; this effect was blocked by PPP. Another antimyoclonic drug combination, L-5-hydroxytryptophan plus chlorimipramine, was not blocked by PPP or indomethacin. The antimyoclonic action of clonazepam may be mediated by enhancement of PG synthesis.", 
    "44": "The effects of neuronal degeneration on benzodiazepine binding parameters were assessed following bilateral electrolytic lesions of rat brain lateral olfactory tracts. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding was measured in olfactory bulb homogenates 1, 7 and 14 days post-lesion. Specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding was significantly decreased two weeks after lesions. Diminution in binding was associated with a decreased population of sites (Bmax) rather than affinity alterations (KD). The time course for the loss of receptors is compatible with retrograde degeneration and suggests that specific benzodiazepine binding sites are in part located on mitral cell-bodies.", 
    "45": "The preparation of brain cells in the presence of diazepam leads to a 60-70% increase in benzodiazepine receptor density. Diazepam may promote the dissociation of endogenous inhibitors (modulators) and/or retard the dissociation of benzodiazepin receptors from the membrane to the medium. Routinely used procedures for tissue preparation reveal only part of the benzodiazepine receptors originally present in the tissue.", 
    "46": "A high performance liquid chromatographic method for the determination of N-1-hydroxyethylflurazepam, the major urinary metabolite of flurazepam, in human urine is described. Urine specimens were incubated enzymatically to deconjugate N-1-hydroxyethylflurazepam glucuronide (metabolite) and were then extracted at pH 9.0 to extract the metabolite. The extracts were chromatographed on a microparticulate silica gel column using automatic sample injection, isocratic elution at ambient temperature and UV monitoring at 254 nm. The internal standard was 7 chloro-5(2'-chlorophenyl) 1,3-dihydro-1-2-dimethylaminoethyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one. The recovery from urine, in the 0.5-25.0 microgram/ml range, was 96.5 +/- 11.5% (S.D.), and the sensitivity limit was 0.5 microgram/ml. The method was found to be specific for N-1-hydroxyethylflurazepam in the presence of intact flurazepam and other possible urinary metabolites of flurazepam. The method was successfully applied to urine specimens collected from human subjects following the administration of 30-mg single oral doses of flurazepam dihydrochloride.", 
    "47": "Studies were performed to evaluate the time course and possible significance of changes in specific benzodiazepine binding that occur chronic treatment. Rats were offered flurazepam in a saccharin solution as their only fluid supply. Each rats consumed 100-150 mg/kg daily. Such treatment produced no change in the binding constant (KD) of specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Maximal binding capacity (Bmax) was reduced by about 20% after 4 or 8 weeks of treatment, but not by 2 weeks or less. Bmax returned to control within 24 h after the end of chronic treatment. Rats were tested for susceptibility to flurazepam by injecting 20-200 mg/kg i.p., and assessing locomotor impairment. Dose-response analysis showed tolerance only after treatments and at times when Bmax was reduced. The results suggest that the reduced Bmax is an adaptive change in response to chronic benzodiazepine treatment, and that the mechanism for tolerance is a reduction of receptors.", 
    "48": "Benzodiazepines produce most, if not all, of their numerous effects on the central nervous system (CNS) primarily by increasing the function of those chemical synapses that use gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) as transmitter. This specific enhancing effect on GABAergic synaptic inhibition is initiated by the interaction of benzodiazepines with membrane proteins of certain central neurones, to which drugs of this chemical class bind with high affinity and specificity. The molecular processes triggered by the interaction of these drugs with central benzodiazepine receptors, and which result in facilitation of GABAergic transmission, are still incompletely understood. Theoretically, benzodiazepines could mimic the effect of hypothetical endogenous ligands for the benzodiazepine receptors, although there is no convincing evidence for their existence; in vitro studies indicate that benzodiazepines might compete with a modulatory peptide which is present in the supramolecular assembly formed by GABA receptor, chloride ionophore and benzodiazepine receptor and which reduces the affinity of the GABA receptor for its physiological ligand. The mechanisms of action of benzodiazepines at the molecular level are likely to be better understood following our recent discovery of benzodiazepine derivatives, whose unique pharmacological activity is to prevent or abolish in a highly selective manner at the receptor level all the characteristic centrally mediated effects of active benzodiazepines. Here, we describe the main properties of a representative of this novel class of specific benzodiazepine antagonists.", 
    "49": "Fifty-three neonates born to 51 mothers treated with lorazepam were followed up for five days after delivery. Lorazepam had been given by mouth to 35 mothers and intravenously to 16. In general, maternal plasma concentrations of lorazepam were higher than the corresponding cord plasma concentrations. Cord plasma concentrations exceeding 45 micrograms/l were associated with three-quarters of the infants requiring ventilation at birth. Neonates conjugate lorazepam slowly to the pharmacologically inactive glucuronide, which is then excreted in the urine, where it is detectable for over seven days. Though lorazepam was detectable in breast milk, the maximum amounts that an infant could absorb would be pharmacologically insignificant. Full-term neonates whose mothers had received oral lorazepam had no complications apart from slight delay in establishing feeding, which in seven out of 29 cases was associated with relatively large doses of lorazepam. Intravenous lorazepam for severe hypertension was associated with significantly low Apgar scores, need for ventilation, hypothermia, and poor suckling. Preterm babies whose mothers had been given lorazepam by either route had a high incidence of low Apgar scores, need for ventilation, hypothermia, and poor suckling. These babies had lower Apgar scores than those whose mothers had received diazepam, but the diazepam group were heavier and more mature. Lorazepam was an effective sedative and anxiolytic by either route, and there were no eclamptic fits among the lorazepam-treated patients. The effects of lorazepam on neonates indicate that its intravenous use at any stage in pregnancy and oral use before 37 weeks should be restricted to hospitals with facilities for neonatal intensive care.", 
    "50": "Acute and chronic experiments were performed on rats to examine the effects of diazepam (Valium) on recurrent inhibition in the monosynaptic perforant path-dentate synapse of the dentate area of the dorsal hippocampus. Evidence was obtained which indicated that diazepam facilitated a presumably GABA mediated post synaptic recurrent inhibition in both acute and chronic preparations at 1 and 2 mg/kg doses (IP). Acute studies also revealed that diazepam prolonged recurrent inhibition, possibly by lengthening the IPSP. An effect of the drug on cholinergically mediated positive feedback from the septum could not be ruled out, however. Taken together, this study extends the evidence that diazepam acts centrally on GABA mediated inhibition in the limbic system. Furthermore, the limbic action of diazepam revealed here suggests a mechanism for the anticonvulsant properties of diazepam in epilepsy involving subcortical (limbic) circuitry.", 
    "51": "A number of drugs bind to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein in plasma. To determine whether age-related changes in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein influence drug binding in mother and newborn infant and also the effects of sex, pregnancy, and oral contraceptives on drug binding, the binding of lidocaine, diazepam, propranolol, d-tubocurarine, and metocurine was determined by equilibrium dialysis in 17 men, 16 nonpregnant women, 16 nonpregnant women on oral contraceptives, and 15 mothers and their newborn infants at delivery. The free fraction of d-tubocurarine (p less than 0.05), metocurine (p less than 0.01), propranolol (p less than 0.001), and lidocaine (p less than 0.02) was higher in neonatal blood than in maternal blood, whereas the free fraction of diazepam was less in fetal cord blood than the mother's (p less than 0.02), but higher than that in nonpregnant women (p less than 0.001). The free fractions of diazepam, propranolol, and lidocaine were higher (p less than 0.001) in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women while the diazepam and lidocaine free fractions were higher (p less than 0.05) in nonpregnant women and oral contraceptives than in women not using them. Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was lower in the fetus (15.3 +/- 4.7 mg/100 ml) than the mother (49.6 +/- 6.5 mg/100 ml) (p less than 0.002). There was a positive correlation between plasma alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentrations and the binding ratio (bound/free concentrations) of lidocaine (p less than 0.001; r = 0.623) and propranolol (p less than 0.001); r = 0.652), indicating that it is likely that the elevation of the free fraction of these drugs in the fetus is due in part to lower levels of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein."
