    "0": "While salicylates (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have been detected in the aquatic environment, few studies have focused on the mechanism of action of these pharmaceuticals on aquatic organisms. We reported previously that salicylate disrupted the acute trophic hormone-stimulated corticosteroidogenesis in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) interrenal tissue in vitro. Here, we tested the hypothesis that this drug will inhibit the adaptive plasma cortisol response and the associated metabolic response to an acute stressor in trout. Fish were fed salicylate-laced feed (100 mg/kg body weight) for 3 days, subjected to an acute (5 min) handling disturbance and sampled 1, 4 and 24 h after the stressor exposure. Salicylate treatment attenuated the stressor-induced plasma cortisol but not glucose or lactate elevations. The disruption of cortisol response corresponded with a significant reduction in transcript levels of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), but not peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage or 11beta-hydroxylase. Salicylate did not modify the stressor-induced elevation of brain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein expression, while liver GR protein content was reduced. Salicylate impact on liver metabolic capacity involved depressed liver glycogen content, whereas no significant changes in liver hexokinase, glucokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities were observed. Taken together, salicylate impairs the stressor-mediated plasma cortisol response and the associated liver metabolic capacity in trout. The mode of action of salicylate involves disruption of StAR and liver GR, two key proteins critical for cortisol production and target tissue responsiveness to this steroid, respectively.",

    "7": "Continued usage of cocaine is determined by genetic, conditioned and homeostatic factors, while it is reinforced by drug-induced reward and the emotionally negative state of drug withdrawal, which includes anxiety. The molecular mechanisms of these long-term behavioral and physiological alterations have yet to be fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that in zebrafish, a wide range of non-anesthetic cocaine doses, 0.015-15 muM, does not result in acute alterations in locomotor activity, in spite of the high brain cocaine levels induced (7-120 pg/microg protein). Conversely, cocaine withdrawal causes hyperactivity associated with stereotypy. The behavioral hyperactivity is progressively increased during the initial period of withdrawal (24-72 h) and is maintained for at least 5 days. Such effect of cocaine withdrawal is aggravated by environmental stimulation and attenuated in the home environment. Administration of cocaine (1.5 microM) or a non-sedative dose of diazepam (5 microM, immersion) acutely counteracts withdrawal-associated hyperactivity and stereotypy in zebrafish, with the magnitude of these effects positively correlating with the degree of prior increase in basal activity. Administration of an anxiogenic benzodiazepine inverse agonist, FG-7142, results in zebrafish behavior similar to that observed during cocaine withdrawal. Together, the results suggest that cocaine withdrawal produces long-lasting behavioral effects in zebrafish which are consistent with an anxiety-like state. Thus, zebrafish, a powerful model for the study of vertebrate genetics, could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of drug withdrawal.",

    "12": "Tinnitus, the perception of noise in the absence of an external auditory stimulus, is common, frequently distressing and often intractable. It is associated with a number of conditions including deafness but may arise spontaneously. Brain imaging studies indicate increased neuronal excitability and decreased density of benzodiazepine receptors in temporal (auditory) cortex but the source and mechanism of such changes are unknown. Various electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities involving temporal lobe and other brain areas have been described but recordings have been limited to standard EEG wave bands up to frequencies of 22Hz. This clinical study of otherwise healthy patients with intractable unilateral tinnitus, using quantitative EEG power spectral mapping (QEEG), identified discrete localised unilateral foci of high frequency activity in the gamma range (>40-80Hz) over the auditory cortex in eight patients experiencing tinnitus during recording. These high frequency \"hot spots\" were not present in 25 subjects without tinnitus. The results suggest that further EEG investigations should include recordings in the gamma frequency range since such high frequency oscillations are believed to be necessary for perception. Identification of \"hot spots\" in tinnitus patients would provide a means for monitoring the effects of new treatments. These findings may also provide a model for exploration of more complex phenomena such as verbal and musical hallucinations.", 
    "13": "HIV encephalitis (HIVE) is a neurodegenerative disease seen in approximately one in four terminally infected patients. Macaques infected with the simian immunodeficiency virus develop encephalitis (SIVE) very similar to the human disease. Neurodegeneration in both these conditions occurs from the effects of toxic viral proteins and neurotoxins derived from activated brain macrophages. Activated macrophages in the brain of macaques with SIVE can be labeled in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET) using PK11195, a ligand that binds the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). However, the functional significance and mechanisms mediating increased PK11195 binding in activated brain macrophages are not known. Using post mortem tissues from macaques with SIVE and macrophages cell cultures activated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), we show that [(3)H](R)-PK11195 binding is increased in activated macrophages. Increased [(3)H](R)-PK11195 binding in LPS-activated macrophages was reversed by pharmacologically inhibiting class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-kinase), but was not altered by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-kinase) pathway. Our results suggest that activated macrophages in lentiviral encephalitis show increased [(3)H](R)-PK11195 binding in a PI3-kinase-dependent fashion which may help elucidate the function of PBR in activated brain macrophages in HIVE and other neuroinflammatory diseases.", 
    "14": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are the most used psychoactive drugs in the pharmacotherapy of anxiety. A large number of structurally different classes of ligands are also active in the modulation of anxiety, showing high affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site (BDZ-bs) of the GABA (A) receptor complex. Various synthetic derivatives of natural flavonoids have been found to have very potent anxiolytic properties. This study was undertaken to provide a behavioral characterization of two novels halogenated flavonoids, 5-methoxy-6, 8-dibromoflavanone (FV1), and 6-bromoflavanone (FV2). These compounds were tested and compared to diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) and to the natural flavonoid chrysin (1 mg/kg) as a standard of activity. When injected in mice (0.5, 1 mg/kg i.p) both synthetic flavonoids increased the locomotor activity and the exploratory skills of the animals, as measured in the open-field and in the hole-board tests. Both compounds, indeed, had a clear anxiolytic activity in the elevated plus-maze, as measured by an increased number of entries and the percentage of time spent in the open arms. At the tested doses, both compounds did not induce sedative action or compulsive behaviour. These results encourage making deeper investigations on this field.", 
    "15": "Alcohol produces many subjective and objective effects in man including pleasure, sedation, anxiolysis, plus impaired eye movements and memory. In human volunteers we have used a newly available GABA-A/benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist that is selective for the alpha5 subtype (a5IA) to evaluate the role of this subtype in mediating these effects of alcohol on the brain. After pre-treatment with a5IA, we found almost complete blockade of the marked impairment caused by alcohol (mean breath concentration 150mg/100ml) of word list learning and partial but non-significant reversal of subjective sedation without effects on other measures such as intoxication, liking, and slowing of eye movements. This action was not due to alterations in alcohol kinetics and so provides the first proof of concept that selectively decreasing GABA-A receptor function at a specific receptor subtype can offset some actions of alcohol in humans. It also supports growing evidence for a key role of the alpha5 subtype in memory. Inverse agonists at other GABA-A receptor subtypes may prove able to reverse other actions of alcohol, and so offer a new approach to understanding the actions of alcohol in the human brain and in the treatment of alcohol related disorders in humans.",

The endogenous photosensitizer, PpIX and related metabolites including coproporphyrin III are known to traffic into or out of the mitochondria via the PBRs situated on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Cells of astrocytic derivation within the brain express PBRs, while neurons express the central-type of benzodiazepine receptor.",

LLLT involved using broad-spectrum red light of 600-800 nm or monochromatic laser light specific to 635 or 905 nm wavelength. Cells (5 x 10(5)) were exposed to a range of LLLT doses (0, 1, or 5 J/cm(2)) using a fixed intensity of 10 mW/cm(2) and subsequently harvested for cell viability, immunofluorescence, or Western blot analysis of PBR expression. The amount of PpIX within the cells was determined using chemical extraction techniques.", 
    "19": "Results confirm the induction of PBR following LLLT is dependent on the dose and wavelength of light used. Broad-spectrum red light provided the greatest cell kill following PDT, although LLLT with 635 nm or 905 nm also increased cell kill as compared to PDT alone. All LLLT regimens increased PBR expression compared to controls with corresponding increases in PpIX production.",

    "25": "Assessing treatment effectiveness in longitudinal observational data is complicated as patients may change medications at any time. To illustrate, three general statistical strategies were utilized to assess treatment effectiveness in an observational schizophrenia study: ignoring, eliminating, and modeling the switching. Differential switching rates produced dramatic differences in estimates of treatment effectiveness across the strategies, with p-values ranging from nearly 0 to almost 1. Ignoring the treatment switching by utilizing intent-to-treat approaches resulted in treatment effect estimates of near zero. Various methods of eliminating the switching, such as epoch analyses and on-drug subset analyses, along with use of marginal structural models generated reasonably consistent non-zero treatment effect estimates. When analyzing longitudinal observational data, researchers must understand the options, key concepts and assumptions behind the various statistical methods available. Marginal structural models are a promising approach to estimation of causal treatment effects in such data.",

Antidepressant drugs are among the most commonly encountered causes of self-poisoning, as illustrated by several published cases in the literature. This investigation reports a case of massive amitriptyline intoxication, involving a 44-year old female found dead in bed. The presence of this tricyclic antidepressant was revealed by a routine screening procedure. The concentration was calculated by gas chromatography/ electron ionization-mass spectrometry in the selected ion monitoring mode after solid-phase extraction using proadifen as internal standard and was in the post-mortem whole blood sample 85.9 mug/mL. This value was much higher than the reported toxic values ever found in the literature, and may therefore have caused the victim's death. Nortriptyline was also detected in the toxic concentration range, as well as therapeutic levels of diazepam and nor-diazepam. Taking into account both the available circumstantial information and toxicological results, it is very likely that death was caused by self-poisoning.

    "31": "Panic attacks and respiratory disease have been shown to have probable links; which one is the precursor to the other is unknown. However, what is known is that there is a correlation between high serum carbon dioxide and lactate levels, which are suffocation indicators, and panic attacks. Females are at a higher risk of suffering panic attacks than men, as they have been shown to have a lower tolerance of suffocation indicators. The aim of this paper is to review the relevance of panic attacks within the intensive care unit setting, where a significant number of patients with respiratory disease have an oral endotracheal tube, which limits communication and may add to the feeling of panic. Using a reflective model, I revisited the actual scenario and consider the series of events as I reflect in action, and at the conclusion of the situation, I reflect on action. The results show that suffering from panic attacks did not inhibit the patient with weaning from the ventilator. Effective communication between the patient and myself led to recognition of the problem, for the correct treatment to be being given, and enabling subsequent extubation. In conclusion, once the link is made of the likelihood of a patient with respiratory disease being prone to panic attacks, the nurse can communicate with the patient or family to establish whether the patient has a panic disorder. The treatment of a regular benzodiazepine, such as diazepam, and constant reassurance from the nurse can then be given to the patient to minimize the symptoms. Reducing the effects of panic attacks can decrease the distress experienced by the patient and improve the clinical picture to facilitate extubation.",

Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe the health outcomes and patterns of use of CNS-active drugs in PWD living in the community. Using a retrospective study design from a southeastern managed care organization (MCO), claims data were collected for three years on all identified cases with dementia and included age, gender, medical diagnoses for each claim (International Classification of Disease [ICD-9 code]) and prescription drugs (National Drug Code [NDC]). Individuals (N = 960) were selected who were continuously enrolled and had prescription drug coverage. Over 79% of PWD in this sample were on a CNS-active medication during the three-year period and 35% were on a benzodiazepine. The highest number of drug-related problems (DRPs) within 45 days after receiving a CNS drug prescription were for syncope, fatigue, altered level of consciousness, delirium, constipation, falls and fractures. This study illustrates the need to further examine inappropriate CNS-active medication use in PWD and to test non-pharmacologic therapies for the clinical problems that initiate their use in PWD.",

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of benzodiazepines in the treatment of GAD based on trial drop-out rates. We used a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that compared any of the three best established benzodiazepines (diazepam, Lorazepam and aLprazolam) against placebo. Our primary outcome for effectiveness was withdrawal for any reason. Our secondary outcome tapping efficacy was withdrawal due to lack of efficacy, and that tapping side effects was withdrawals due to adverse events. We included 23 trials. Pooled analysis indicated less risk of treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy for benzodiazepines, compared to placebo, relative risk (RR) 0.29 (95% CI 0.18-0.45; p < 0.00001). Nevertheless, pooled analysis showed no conclusive results for risk of all-cause patient discontinuation, RR 0.78 (95% CI 0.62-1.00; p = 0.05). Meta-regression model showed that 74% of the variation in logRR across the studies was explained by year of publication (p <0.001). This systematic review did not find convincing evidence of the short-term effectiveness of the benzodiazepines in the treatment of GAD. On the other hand, for the outcome of efficacy, this review found robust evidence in favour of benzodiazepines. Due to the heterogeneity induced by year of publication, three hypotheses are plausibLe when it comes to being able to account for the differences between efficacy and effectiveness observed in the outcomes (publication bias, quality of the trial literature and a non-differential response to the placebo effect).", 
    "43": "Cytotoxic effects on neuronal as well as on immune cells have been reported for both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs. We evaluated the effects of different concentrations of a typical (haloperidol) and two atypical (clozapine, olanzapine) antipsychotics on the survival of human neuronal (SH-SY5Y cells) and immune cells (U937 cells) by determining the metabolic activity after 24 h of incubation by the modified tetrazolium method. The dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and the lymphoma U-937 cell line are well established models for in vitro investigations. To further elucidate possible mechanisms of action we also determined the ATP content in the cultured cells. After experimental treatment, significant effects were detected by Kruskal Wallis test for all treatment conditions. Post-hoc tests (Dunn's method) showed that haloperidol and clozapine at the two highest concentrations (25 and 50 microg/ml) caused a significant decrease of metabolic activity in both cell systems, which was also detectable after treatment with clozapine at a concentration of 12.5 microg/ml in U937 cells. In contrast, olanzapine induced a significant increase in metabolic activity of SH-SY5Y cells at all concentrations except for the concentration of 3.1 microg/ml, whereas the metabolic activity in U937 cells was increased at concentrations of 1.6 and 6.25 microg/ml. For the determination of ATP content, the LD(50) values of the metabolic activity were used, except for olanzapine for which no distinct LD(50) value was available. Significant changes were detected for all treatments and post-hoc tests revealed that haloperidol caused a significant decrease compared to the control condition in both cell systems. These findings suggest that antipsychotic substances of different classes exert differential metabolic effects in both neuronal and immune cell systems.",

The standard first-line treatments, including antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and buspirone, result in significant response rates for a majority of patients; however, unfavorable side effect profiles or risk for dependency for particular agents might limit their use by anxious patients, who often have low thresholds for medication discontinuation. Novel pharmacologic agents that modulate particular receptors, ion channels, or transporters relevant to glutamatergic neurotransmission may represent a new approach to the treatment of anxiety disorders, with generally more favorable side effect profiles.

Five minutes after premedication with intramuscular (IM) 0.04 mg/kg atropine, group A (n = 43), B (n = 40) and C (n = 28) all were anaesthetized with 0.5 mg/kg midazolam, combined with 10, 20 or 30 microg/kg medetomidine, and 1.0, 2.0 or 3.0 mg/kg ketamine, respectively, IM in one syringe. Group D (n = 11) received the established combination of 50 microg/kg medetomidine and 10.0 mg/kg ketamine for comparison. Because this study was in cooperation with a project on dental prophylaxis, cats had to be immobilized for approximately 1 h. Therefore, anaesthesia was prolonged with propofol to effect, if necessary. Duration of MMK anaesthesia was between 30 +/- 15, 45 +/- 19 and 68 +/- 28 min in groups A, B and C respectively. A significant decrease of respiratory rate was observed with increasing dosage, but venous carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and pH values in combination with arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) values were not alarming. The diastolic blood pressure particularly showed an increase. MMK combination A showed the best cardiovascular results, but it cannot be recommended due to disadvantages like a long induction time sometimes accompanied by excitations and the short duration of surgical immobilization. Dosage C in contrast had fewer side effects but less favourable cardiovascular results and a longer recovery period. However, either dosage B or C was suitable as a repeatable IM immobilization method for non-invasive procedures in healthy cats.", 
    "51": "Following the disastrous experience with thalidomide women were largely excluded from clinical trials. A change in this paradigm can be observed most recently. For the pharmacokinetics and -dynamics of drugs a body of evidence does exist to prove the presence of significant sex-related differences. Especially fort he major drug metabolizing enzymes, the cytochrome P 450 family, but also for phase II reactions such as glucuronidation, sex-differences were observed. However, most of these differences are either clinically not relevant or were not just observed, because they result in slight increases in the frequency of adverse reactions. Major sex-specific differences were observed for the cardiac elektrophysiology, for opiate and benzodiazepine receptors. Women are significantly more likely to experience drug-induced QT-prolongation and torsade-de-pointes arrhythmia. It should also be considered that conditions such as depression, myocardial infarction and heart failure are characterized by gender-specific symptoms and therefore may deserve a gender-specific therapy. Different trials and epidemiological surveys have repeatedly shown that women experience more adverse drug effects than men.", 
    "52": "Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is often accompanied by tachycardia which is known to be an important pathogenic factor in the development of myocardial ischemia. The pathogenesis of tachycardia is unknown but the condition is thought to be due to the endocrine response to endoscopy. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of sedation on the endocrine response and cardiorespiratory function. Forty patients scheduled for diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were randomized into 2 groups. While the patients in the first group did not receive sedation during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the patients in the second group were sedated with intravenous midazolam at the dose of 5 mg for those under 65 years or 2.5 mg for those aged 65 years or more. Midazolam was administered by slow infusion. In both groups, blood pressure, ECG tracing, heart rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were monitored during endoscopy. In addition, blood samples for the determination of cortisol, glucose and C-reactive protein levels were obtained from patients in both groups prior to and following endoscopy. Heart rate and systolic arterial pressure changes were within normal limits in both groups. Comparison of the two groups regarding the values of these two parameters did not reveal a significant difference, while a statistically significant reduction in SpO2 was found in the sedation group. No significant differences in serum cortisol, glucose or C-reactive protein levels were observed between the sedated and non-sedated group. Sedation with midazolam did not reduce the endocrine response and the tachycardia developing during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, but increased the reduction in SpO2.",

The remainder of the charts were not evaluated because of no effect (n = 6), unrelated or confirmed nonexposure (n = 3), or unable to follow (n = 16). The most common presenting symptom was agitation (82%), whereas seizures were documented in only 2 cases (9%). Tachycardia was common (mean heart rate, 171 beats/min; confidence interval [CI], 154-187), whereas blood pressure (BP) (mean systolic BP, 120 mm Hg; CI, 104-136; and mean diastolic BP, 70 mm Hg; CI, 51-88) and rectal temperature (mean, 37.4 degrees C; CI, 36.9-37.9) were slightly elevated compared with normal values. Creatinine was documented in 6 cases and noted as normal in all (0.3IU/L; CI, 0.2-0.4), whereas creatine kinase was documented in 3 charts and elevated in all (mean 1984 IU/L; range, 212-4942 IU/L).

    "57": "Ethanol enhances gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) signaling in the brain, but its actions are inconsistent at GABA(A) receptors, especially at low concentrations achieved during social drinking. We postulated that the epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (PKCepsilon) regulates the ethanol sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors, as mice lacking PKCepsilon show an increased behavioral response to ethanol. Here we developed an ATP analog-sensitive PKCepsilon mutant to selectively inhibit the catalytic activity of PKCepsilon. We used this mutant and PKCepsilon(-/-) mice to determine that PKCepsilon phosphorylates gamma2 subunits at serine 327 and that reduced phosphorylation of this site enhances the actions of ethanol and benzodiazepines at alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors, which is the most abundant GABA(A) receptor subtype in the brain. Our findings indicate that PKCepsilon phosphorylation of gamma2 regulates the response of GABA(A) receptors to specific allosteric modulators, and, in particular, PKCepsilon inhibition renders these receptors sensitive to low intoxicating concentrations of ethanol.",

    "62": "Fatigue without coincident depression may accompany many neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, stroke and post-polio syndrome, and is frequently reported by patients as a predominant complaint. The pathophysiology of fatigue is unknown. The role of various mechanisms has been suggested, including the effect of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) on glutaminergic transmission, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, disturbances of astroglia metabolism and decreased levels of the neurotransmitters noradrenaline and serotonin. The diagnosis of fatigue syndrome is based on exclusion of depression and additional organic conditions (anaemia, cardiovascular disorders, kidney diseases or hypothyroidism). The treatment of fatigue syndrome is complex. Physical activity, rehabilitation, psychotherapy and avoidance of factors which may increase fatigue, such as fever, anxiety, depression, pain, sleep disturbances, as well as some drugs like opioids and benzodiazepines, are important. Pharmacological treatment leads to slight improvement. Amantadine, modafinil and pemoline are administered to such patients.", 
    "63": "In a randomized controlled trial, we compared the efficacy of topiramate versus placebo in women undergoing olanzapine therapy and found that topiramate effectively contributed to weight loss in short-term treatment and had a positive effect on health-related quality of life, the patients' actual state of health, and psychological impairments. The aim of this observational study was to assess whether topiramate has a sustained benefit in long-term treatment of olanzapine-associated weight gain in subjects who had participated in the previous randomized controlled trial comparing topiramate with placebo. The subjects (topiramate group, n = 25; former placebo group, n = 18) were observed in an 18-month open-label study. After unblinding, subjects from the former topiramate group continued treatment with topiramate, whereas subjects from the former placebo group received neither placebo nor topiramate. The subjects were seen every 6 months, weighed, and tested with the SF-36 Health Survey, Scale of Well-Being, and the Adjective Checklist. According to the intent-to-treat principle, the repeated-measures analysis showed a significant interaction for the group-by-time effect for change of weight (P < 0.01) on the Scale of Well-Being (P < 0.01), all scales of the Adjective Checkist (all P < 0.01), and 5 scales (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, social functioning, mental health, and vitality) of the SF-36 Health Survey (all P < 0.01). Topiramate was well tolerated and seems to be effective and safe in the long-term treatment of olanzapine-related adiposity in women. Furthermore, positive changes in the patients' state of health, psychological impairments, and health-related quality of life could be also observed.",

Similar to other atypical and not typical antipsychotics, JL 13 decreased labeling of NMDA receptors in medial and lateral caudate-putamen (CPu; by 40%). These findings indicate that down-regulation of NMDA receptors by JL 13 and other atypical antipsychotic agents in CPu may contribute to their low risk of extrapyramidal side effects. In addition, and similar to olanzapine and risperidone, JL 13 increased AMPA receptor binding in CPu (by 42%). Changes in AMPA receptors may contribute to psychopharmacological properties of JL 13 and other atypical agents. Similar to clozapine, JL 13 did not alter levels of NMDA and AMPA receptors in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Long-term effects of JL 13 on ionotropic Glu receptors, as well as on other dopamine and serotonin receptors, support the atypical antipsychotic profile of this novel agent.", 
    "65": "Taste bud cells (TBCs) express various neurotransmitter receptors assumed to facilitate or modify taste information processing within taste buds. We investigated the functional expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes, M1-M5, in mouse fungiform TBCs. ACh applied to the basolateral membrane of TBCs elevates the intracellular Ca(2+) level in a concentration-dependent manner with the 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 0.6 microM. The Ca(2+) responses occur in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) and are inhibited by atropine, a selective antagonist against mAChRs. The order of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) examined with a series of antagonists selective to mAChR subtypes shows the expression of M3 on TBCs. Perforated whole-cell voltage clamp studies show that 1 microM ACh blocks an outwardly rectifying current and that 100 nM atropine reverses the block. Reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction studies suggest the expression of M3 but not the other mAChR subtypes. Immunohistochemical studies show that phospholipase Cbeta-immunoreactive TBCs and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa-immunoreactive nerve endings are immunoreactive to a transporter that packs ACh molecules into synaptic vesicles (vesicular acetylcholine transporter). These results show that M3 occurs on a few fungiform TBCs and suggest that a few nerve endings, and probably a few TBCs, release ACh by exocytosis. The role of ACh in taste responses is discussed.",

    "88": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are known to increase the amplitude and duration of IPSCs. Moreover, at low [GABA], BDZs strongly enhance GABAergic currents suggesting the up-regulation of agonist binding while their action on gating remains a matter of debate. In the present study we have examined the impact of flurazepam and zolpidem on mIPSCs by investigating their effects on GABA(A)R binding and gating and by considering dynamic conditions of synaptic receptor activation. Flurazepam and zolpidem enhanced the amplitude and prolonged decay of mIPSCs. Both compounds strongly enhanced responses to low [GABA] but, surprisingly, decreased the currents evoked by saturating or half-saturating [GABA]. Analysis of current responses to ultrafast GABA applications indicated that these compounds enhanced binding and desensitization of GABA(A) receptors. Flurazepam and zolpidem markedly prolonged deactivation of responses to low [GABA] but had almost no effect on deactivation at saturating or half-saturating [GABA]. Moreover, at low [GABA], flurazepam enhanced desensitization-deactivation coupling but zolpidem did not. Recordings of responses to half-saturating [GABA] applications revealed that appropriate timing of agonist exposure was sufficient to reproduce either a decrease or enhancement of currents by flurazepam or zolpidem. Recordings of currents mediated by recombinant ('synaptic') alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors reproduced all major findings observed for neuronal GABA(A)Rs. We conclude that an extremely brief agonist transient renders IPSCs particularly sensitive to the up-regulation of agonist binding by BDZs.",

Physicians may initiate treatment of insomnia at an initial visit; for patients with a clear acute stressor such as grief, no further evaluation may be indicated. However, if insomnia is severe or long-lasting, a thorough evaluation to uncover coexisting medical, neurologic, or psychiatric illness is warranted. Treatment should begin with nonpharmacologic therapy, addressing sleep hygiene issues and exercise. There is good evidence supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy. Exercise improves sleep as effectively as benzodiazepines in some studies and, given its other health benefits, is recommended for patients with insomnia. Hypnotics generally should be prescribed for short periods only, with the frequency and duration of use customized to each patient's circumstances. Routine use of over-the-counter drugs containing antihistamines should be discouraged. Alcohol has the potential for abuse and should not be used as a sleep aid. Opiates are valuable in pain-associated insomnia. Benzodiazepines are most useful for short-term treatment; however, long-term use may lead to adverse effects and withdrawal phenomena. The better safety profile of the newer-generation nonbenzodiazepines (i.e., zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopidone, and ramelteon) makes them better first-line choices for long-term treatment of chronic insomnia.",

The method employed a double-coated capillary coated with poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) and then dextran sulphate. The BGE conditions were 100 mM ammonium phosphate buffer, pH 2.5, which gave baseline resolution between consecutive peaks and a run time of less than 6.5 min.

Here, 10 day-old chicks were intraperitoneally injected with insulin, epinephrine or vehicle and then immediately stressed by partial water immersion for 15 min and killed by decapitation. Non-stressed controls were similarly injected, then returned to their rearing boxes for 15 min and then killed. Forebrains were dissected and GABAA receptor density was measured ex vivo in synaptosomes by 3[H]-flunitrazepam binding assay. In non-stressed chicks, insulin at 1.25, 2.50 and 5.00 IU/kg of body weight (non-hypoglycemic doses) increased Bmax by 33, 53 and 44% compared to saline, respectively. A similar increase of 41% was observed in receptor density after stress. However, the insulin effect was not additive to the stress-induced increase suggesting that both effects occur through similar mechanisms. In contrast, epinephrine, at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg did not induce any changes in Bmax in non-stressed chicks. Nevertheless, after stress these doses increased the receptor density by about 13 and 27%, respectively. Similarly, the same epinephrine doses co-administered with insulin (2.50 IU/kg), increased the receptor density by about 20% compared to insulin alone. These results suggest that systemic epinephrine, perhaps by evoking central norepinephrine release, modulates the increase in forebrain GABAA receptor binding induced by both insulin and stress.", 
    "111": "Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is uncommon in brucellosis. Neurological complications of brucellosis may be divided into 2 major groups: 1) those related to the acute-febrile state that occurs in acute disease (toxic-febrile neurobrucellosis), and 2) those related to actual invasion and localization of the pathogen in the CNS (classical neurobrucellosis). In this paper, we present 4 cases of toxic-febrile neurobrucellosis and discuss clinical findings and outcome of treatment in these cases. All patients had fever, headache, stupor or coma with neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucination, delirium, convulsion, dysarthria, psychosis, and night raving. Peripheral and cranial vasculitis was present in case 3 and bilateral sensorioneural hearing loss in case 4. Neither pleocytosis nor hyperproteinorrachia was present in any patient in lumbar puncture. Brucella melitensis was isolated in case 3 from bone marrow, and in case 4 both from blood and bone marrow. All patients received combined treatment consisting of ceftriaxone, rifampicin, and doxycycline. They were discharged from the hospital with full recovery. No recurrence or any complaint was observed during the follow-up. In conclusion, despite the rapid course and serious complications, outcome from febrile-toxic neurobrucellosis is excellent especially when effective antimicrobial therapy is started early in the course of illness.",

The block copolymers with the methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) to poly(D, L-lactide) weight ratio of 80/20, 50/50, 40/60 were synthesized by a ring-opening polymerization procedure. In vitro transcorneal experiments demonstrated that the block copolymer 80/20 significantly enhanced the transcorneal permeation of pirenzepine at the mass ratio of 1/1.4 (pirenzepine hydrochloride/copolymer). Interaction between pirenzepine and copolymer was identified by infrared spectroscopy analysis and dialysis experiments. Ocular pharmacokinetics of pirenzepine/copolymer preparation by in vivo instillation experiments confirmed that block copolymer could enhance the ocular penetration of pirenzepine. Ocular chronic toxicity experiments of block copolymer and pirenzepine/copolymer preparation were studied on rabbits, and no significant toxicity in both groups was observed within 9 months. It could conclude that pirenzepine/copolymer preparation is effective and safe in ocular delivery of pirenzepine.",

We studied the rates, correlates, and safety of individual benzodiazepines and zolpidem use from the records of 3690 patients in a national cohort of Dialysis Morbidity and Mortality Study Wave 2 data. We assessed drug utilization and an association between drug use and all-cause mortality. Overall, 14% of incident dialysis patients used a benzodiazepine or zolpidem. Women, Caucasians, current smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were more likely to use these drugs, whereas patients with cerebrovascular disease were less likely to use these drugs. In adjusted analyses, benzodiazepine or zolpidem use was associated with a 15% higher mortality rate. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease significantly modified this association, suggesting that these patients were at higher risk. No association was found between benzodiazepine use and greater risk for hip fracture. We conclude that benzodiazepine or zolpidem use is common in incident dialysis patients and may be associated with greater mortality. Further studies are needed to elucidate the safety of these drugs in the dialysis population, which may lead to cautious and restrictive utilization of omega-receptor agonists in dialysis patients.",

This guideline applies to the ingestion of dextromethorphan alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions might be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) Patients who exhibit more than mild effects (e.g., infrequent vomiting or somnolence [lightly sedated and arousable with speaking voice or light touch]) after an acute dextromethorphan ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade C). 3) Patients who have ingested 5-7.5 mg/kg should receive poison center-initiated follow-up approximately every 2 hours for up to 4 hours after ingestion. Refer to an emergency department if more than mild symptoms develop (Grade D). 4) Patients who have ingested more than 7.5 mg/kg should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade C). 5) If the patient is taking other medications likely to interact with dextromethorphan and cause serotonin syndrome, such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, poison center-initiated follow-up every 2 hours for 8 hours is recommended (Grade D). 6) Patients who are asymptomatic and more than 4 hours have elapsed since the time of ingestion can be observed at home (Grade C). 7) Do not induce emesis (Grade D). 8) Do not use activated charcoal at home. Activated charcoal can be administered to asymptomatic patients who have ingested overdoses of dextromethorphan within the preceding hour. Its administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grade D). 9) For patients who have ingested dextromethorphan and are sedated or comatose, naloxone, in the usual doses for treatment of opioid overdose, can be considered for prehospital administration, particularly if the patient has respiratory depression (Grade C). 10) Use intravenous benzodiazepines for seizures and benzodiazepines and external cooling measures for hyperthermia (>104 degrees F, >40 degrees C) for serotonin syndrome. This should be done in consultation with and authorized by EMS medical direction, by a written treatment protocol or policy, or with direct medical oversight (Grade C). 11) Carefully ascertain by history whether other drugs, such as acetaminophen, were involved in the incident and assess the risk for toxicity or for a drug interaction.",

Brain beta-endorphins were higher in experiment group treated with trazodone (929 pg/g +/- 44,43; X+/-SD), and dibenzepine (906,63 pg/g +/- 74,06), yet with lower brain content in rats treated with diazepam (841,55 pg/g +/- 68,47), compared to brain beta-endorphins content of control group treated with saline solution (0,95% NaCl) (873,5 pg/g +/- 44,89). Significant differences were obtained comparing brain beta-endorphins of trazodone vs. diazepam treated animals, with diazepam group having lower values (p<0,02). This study showed differences in changes of rat brain beta-endorphins contents when different psychoactive drugs are used.

When testing for differences in laminar distribution patterns, all receptor-density profiles differed significantly from the cyto- and myeloarchitectonic ones. These results indicate that receptor distribution is an independent feature of the cortical architecture not predictable by densities of cell bodies or myelinated fibres. Receptor co-distribution was studied by cluster analyses, revealing several groups of receptors, which showed similar laminar distribution patterns across all analysed areas (V1-V3). Other receptors were co-distributed in extrastriate but not primary visual cortex. Finally, some receptors were not co-distributed with any of the analysed other ones. A comparison of the laminar patterns of receptor binding sites in the human visual cortex with those reported for non-human primates and other mammals showed that the laminar distributions of cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors seem largely preserved, while serotoninergic and adrenergic receptors appear to be more variable between different species.",

Several studies have shown that the pharmacokinetics of a number of drugs are altered in AA rats. We investigated the effects of AA on the barrier functions of the intestine using a rat model. Intestinal CYP3A activities (midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and 7-benzyloxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)-coumarin 7-hydroxylation) in AA rats were significantly decreased compared with those in normal rats, with marked decrease observed in the upper segment of intestine. Intestinal P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity at upper segment was also significantly decreased in AA rats to 60% of that in normal rats, and the other segments (middle and lower) of intestine also exhibited tendencies toward decrease in P-gp activity. This decrease was supported by the finding that levels of mdr1a mRNA and P-gp protein were decreased in AA rats. No significant differences were observed in intestinal paracellular and transcellular permeability between AA and normal rats. These results suggest that intestinal CYP3A and P-gp activities are decreased in AA rats, and that the pharmacokinetics and bioavailabilities of drugs whose membrane permeation is limited by intestinal CYP3A and/or P-gp may be altered in rheumatic diseases.",

    "173": "Elderly patients, 65-80 years (N=358; 55% female; mean age, 71 years) who met the criteria for primary insomnia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) for three months were randomized to two weeks of double-blind nightly treatment with 5 mg or 10 mg indiplon or placebo. Daily self-assessments by the patients included latency to sleep onset (LSO), total sleep time (TST), number of awakenings (NAW), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep quality. Data were collected between July, 2002, and October, 2003, at 52 clinical research sites in North America.", 
    "174": "Treatment with indiplon was associated with significant reduction in LSO at Week 1 for the 5 mg (34.6+/-1.8 min) and 10 mg doses (30.4+/-1.6 min) relative to placebo (47.4+/-2.5 min; p<0.0001 for both comparisons). During Week 2, LSO remained shorter on both indiplon doses compared to placebo (5 mg, p=0.016; and 10 mg, p=0.0028). During both study weeks, treatment with indiplon was also associated with significant improvement, relative to placebo, in TST, NAW, WASO, and sleep quality. The frequency of adverse events was similar in the indiplon 5 mg and placebo groups; somnolence, nausea, depression and decreased appetite were slightly more common in the indiplon 10 mg group.", 
    "175": "In elderly patients with primary insomnia, indiplon 5 mg and 10 mg were efficacious in inducing and maintaining sleep and improving sleep quality during the two weeks of treatment. Indiplon 5mg was well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events and no significant changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) or routine clinical laboratory evaluations; the 10mg dose produced slightly greater efficacy as well as somewhat increased adverse events.",

    "177": "The plasmid pCR 3.1/GR expressing the gastrin receptor cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK-2R) was transfected into colonic carcinoma cells of the line Colo320 by Lipofectamine 2000. The clones expressing stably CCK-2R were screened by G418 and named as Colo320WT cells. The expression levels of gastrin receptor of the Colo320 and Colo320WT cells were assayed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. The Colo320WT cells were treated by gastrin-17, and the expression levels of phosphorylated FAKTyr397 and total focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the Colo320WT cells at the time points 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h were detected by Western blotting. Another Colo320WT cells were treated by L365, 260, gastrin17 receptor blocker, for 30 minutes firstly and then treated by gastrin17 again for 12 hours, and then Western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of phosphorylated FAKTyr397 and total focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at the time points 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Confocal microscopy was used to observe the phosphorylated FAKTyr397 localizing in the lamellipodia. The information of FAK-Src-p130(Cas)-Dock180 signaling complex was assayed by coimmuniprecipation and immunity blotting. The level of Rac-GTPase was tested by pull down assay.", 
    "178": "The level of phosphorylated FAKTyr397 expression in the Colo320WT cells after the gastrin17 intervention increased time-dependently and peaked at the time point of 12 h, and the phosphorylated FAKTyr397 expression in the Colo320WT cells treated by L365, 260 decreased remarkably, but the level of total FAK remained unchanged. The phosphorylated FAKTyr397/FAK levels were 2.82%, 9.28%, 22.62%, 38.59%, 28.41%, and 14.94%, 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the gastrin17 treatment respectively, and the level was 7.21% after L365, 260 treatment. The amount of phosphorylated FAKTyr397 localizing in the lamellipodia of the Colo320WT cells that were treated by gastrin17 increased time-dependently and peaked at the time-point 12 h. FAK-Src-p130(Cas)-Dock180 signaling complex was formed in the Colo320WT cells stimulated with gastrin17. Gastrin17 activated Rac, but did not affect the total Rac expression.", 
    "179": "The mechanism of increasing the colon cancer cells' invasion by gastrin17 is probably that gastrin17 makes FAK-Tyr397 phosphorylated and be localized to lamellipodia, causes the forming of FAK-Src-p130(Cas)-Dock180 signaling complex when it is bound to its receptor CCK-2, and activation of Rac.", 
    "180": "In many of Africa's rural areas, snakebite victims often resort to traditional healers for first line treatment. This may be source of infectious complications. We report a case of generalized tetanus which occured after 15 days in a 13-years old boy who had applied a traditional, plant-based concoction on a snake bite. He presented with trismus, generalized contractures and fever extended musculo-aponevrotic necrosis of the right upper limb, without loss of consciousness. The only accompanying biological sign was an increased leukocyte count (11,200/mm3) with a predominance of neutrophils (84%). Platelets count, creatinin and AST/ALT titers and haemostasis were all normal, as was the radiogram of the right hand. The clinical outcome was favourable after 3 weeks hopital care (antibiotic, muscle relaxants, antitetanus serotherapy and local wounds care). This clinical observation shows that traditional care for snake bite wounds can be an entry point for tetanus. Appropriate treatment of snake bites in a hospital setting is of the utmost importance, in addition to vaccination against tetanus, in order to reduce the incidence of tetanus in African countries.",

    "182": "A retrospective, prehospital case series conducted in Israel among military medical teams over the course of nearly 2 years, between January 2000 and October 2002. We collected a case series of patients who became combative following traumatic injury. Following data collection, we summoned an expert panel and developed a protocol for physicians and paramedics upon encountering a combative trauma patient.", 
    "183": "Available data were found for 11 patients and these were included in the analysis. Most victims included in this study were injured under military or geographical circumstances mandating a long time interval from injury to definitive care, namely 114 min (range 38-225 min). Five patients received intravenous ketamine, in three of which it was coadministered with midazolam. Sedation with ketamine given alone, or combined with other drugs, was effective in all five cases. In no case did a patient become more agitated after administration. No adverse effects were recorded by the prehospital caregivers.", 
    "184": "In this article, an algorithmic approach to the treatment of the patient's agitation is outlined, using ketamine as the principal sedating agent, either alone or combined with midazolam. The combination of both drugs is suggested for the effective sedation of adult prehospital combative patient population.", 
    "185": "Endogenous opioid systems regulate neurobiological responses to threatening stimuli. Stimulation of kappa-opioid receptors (KORs) produces analgesia but induces prodepressive-like effects in a variety of animal models. In contrast, KOR antagonists have antidepressant-like effects. KORs and their endogenous ligand dynorphin are expressed throughout brain areas involved in fear and anxiety, including the extended amygdala. Here, we examined whether KOR antagonists would affect unlearned fear (anxiety) in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF) paradigms and learned fear in the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) paradigm. These studies were designed to accommodate the slow onset (approximately 24 h) and extended time course (>3 weeks) of the prototypical KOR antagonists nor-binaltorphimine hydrochloride (norBNI) and JDTic [(3R)-7-hydroxy-N-[(1S)-1-[[(3R, 4R)-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl]methyl]-2-methylpropyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinoline-carboxamide hydrochloride]. Rats received an i.p. injection of norBNI (3.0-30 mg/kg) or JDTic (1.0-10 mg/kg) 48 h before EPM testing. One day later, they were tested in the OF, and 5 and 7 days later, they were trained and tested in the FPS paradigm. Both KOR antagonists dose-dependently increased open arm exploration in the EPM without affecting OF behavior. They also decreased conditioned fear in the FPS paradigm. The anxiolytic-like effects of KOR antagonists were qualitatively similar to those of the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide in the EPM. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine had no effect in the EPM and anxiogenic-like effects in the OF. Our results indicate that KOR antagonists produce a unique combination of antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects and suggest that this class of drugs may be particularly effective for the treatment of comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders.", 
    "186": "Part of the mechanism through which estradiol, acting via estrogen receptor (ERalpha) signaling, inhibits feeding in rats and mice is increasing the satiating potency of cholecystokinin (CCK) acting on peripheral CCK-1 receptors. Ingested lipid is a principal secretagogue of intestinal CCK, and intraduodenal lipid infusions elicit CCK-mediated satiation in animals and humans. Here we tested whether estradiol affects the satiating potency of intraduodenal lipid infusions in ovariectomized rats and, using c-Fos immunocytochemistry, searched for potential brain sites of ERalpha involved. Food-deprived ovariectomized rats with open gastric cannulas sham fed 0.8 m sucrose 2 d after estradiol (estradiol benzoate, 10 mug, sc) or vehicle injection. Estradiol markedly increased the satiating potency of intraduodenal infusions of Intralipid but not the satiating potency of L-phenylalanine (10 min infusions, 0.44 ml/min, 0.13 kcal/ml), which in male rats satiates via a CCK-independent mechanism. Estradiol had no significant effect in rats pretreated with the CCK-1 receptor antagonist Devazepide (1 mg/kg, ip). The effect of estradiol on intraduodenal Intralipid-induced satiation was mirrored by selective increases in the number of cells expressing c-Fos immunoreactivity in a circumscribed region of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), just caudal to the area postrema (cNTS) but not elsewhere in the NTS or the hypothalamic paraventricular or arcuate nuclei. In addition, a significant proportion of cNTS c-Fos-positive cells also expressed ERalpha. These data provide behavioral and cellular evidence that estradiol-ERalpha signaling in cNTS neurons increases the satiating potency of endogenous CCK released in response to ingested lipid.", 
    "187": "The mechanisms for drug interactions with smoking and clinically significant pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug interactions with smoking are reviewed.", 
    "188": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are some of the major lung carcinogens found in tobacco smoke. PAHs are potent inducers of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzymes 1A1, 1A2, and, possibly, 2E1. After a person quits smoking, an important consideration is how quickly the induction of CYP1A2 dissipates. The primary pharmacokinetic interactions with smoking occur with drugs that are CYP1A2 substrates, such as caffeine, clozapine, fluvoxamine, olanzapine, tacrine, and theophylline. Inhaled insulin's pharmacokinetic profile is significantly affected, peaking faster and reaching higher concentrations in smokers compared with nonsmokers, achieving significantly faster onset and higher insulin levels. The primary pharmacodynamic drug interactions with smoking are hormonal contraceptives and inhaled corticosteroids. The most clinically significant interaction occurs with combined hormonal contraceptives. The use of hormonal contraceptives of any kind in women who are 35 years or older and smoke 15 or more cigarettes daily is considered contraindicated because of the increased risk of serious cardiovascular adverse effects. The efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids may be reduced in patients with asthma who smoke.", 
    "189": "Numerous drug interactions exist with smoking. Therefore, smokers taking a medication that interacts with smoking may require higher dosages than nonsmokers. Conversely, upon smoking cessation, smokers may require a reduction in the dosage of an interacting medication.",

    "191": "Many antipsychotics cause weight gain in humans, but usually not in rats, when injected once or twice daily. Since blood antipsychotic half-lives are short in rats, compared to humans, chronic administration by constant infusion may be necessary to see consistent weight gain in rats. Male and female rats were implanted with mini-pumps for constant infusion of olanzapine (5 mg/kg/day), clozapine (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 11 days. Food intake and body weight were measured; blood drug levels were measured by HPLC. Olanzapine increased food intake and body weight in female, but not male rats. Serum olanzapine concentrations were 30-35 ng/ml. Clozapine had no effect on food intake or body weight in female or male rats. Serum clozapine concentrations were about 75 ng/ml. Single-dose pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a serum terminal half-life of 1.2-1.5 h for each drug, with no sex differences. Despite the fact that olanzapine and clozapine promote weight gain in humans, these drugs appear to have minimal effects on body weight and food intake in rats, except for a modest effect of olanzapine in female rats, even though therapeutic levels of olanzapine are achieved in serum during chronic infusion. Hence, the rapid clearance of drug following single administration in previous studies cannot explain the weak or absent effects of antipsychotics on weight gain in this species. The rat thus appears to be an inadequate model of weight gain produced by some antipsychotics in humans.", 
    "192": "Risperidone appears to be effective in treating behavioral problems in children with autistic disorder. Although increased appetite, weight gain, and sedation are among the most common side effects, risperidone-induced enuresis is rarely reported.", 
    "193": "We will present two cases with risperidone-induced enuresis, and discuss our findings in the context of current literature.", 
    "194": "Two children aged 11 and 10 years, diagnosed with autism and mental retardation, have developed new-onset diurnal and nocturnal enuresis respectively on their first and second weeks of risperidone monotherapy (1.5 and 1 mg/day). They did not experience sedation, and their medical history and workup were unremarkable. As enuresis did not resolve spontaneously, we decided to substitute risperidone with olanzapine. Enuresis ceased rapidly after discontinuation of risperidone with no emergence when patients were treated with olanzapine 5 mg/day for a period of 6 months and 1 year, respectively.", 
    "195": "Although the pathophysiology of antipsychotic-induced enuresis remains unclear, a number of mechanisms including alpha(1)-adrenergic blockade, dopamine blockade, and antimuscarinic effects has been proposed. Olanzapine has lower alpha(1)-adrenergic and dopaminergic blockade properties, thus changing risperidone to olanzapine may be an alternative modality in risperidone-induced enuresis when antipsychotic treatment is crucial. Clinicians should be more vigilant about screening for this side effect, especially in younger population with developmental disabilities.", 
    "196": "Increased gastrointestinal motility in mice as one of the withdrawal symptoms of commonly abused drugs like diazepam or morphine and its possible mechanism of action was studied. Male Laka mice (20-25 g) were made addict to either diazepam (20 mg/kg, ip for 7 days) or morphine (10 mg/kg, sc for 9 days). Withdrawal symptoms were noted 24 hr after the last injection of diazepam or morphine. The animals were injected with Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) (1 mg/kg, ip) or naloxone (2 mg/kg, ip) in the respective group to precipitate the withdrawal symptoms. Gastrointestinal motility was assessed by charcoal-meal test. Animals developed tolerance to acute sedative effect of diazepam, and similarly to the acute nociceptive action of morphine. On abrupt cessation of these drugs after chronic treatment the animals showed hyperlocomotion and hyperreactivity in diazepam withdrawal group and hyperalgesia on hot plate in morphine withdrawal groups, respectively. Increase in gastrointestinal motility was observed in all the drug withdrawal groups. Treatment with respective antagonists, Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) and naloxone precipitated the withdrawal symptoms. The results suggest the involvement of both central and peripheral receptors of benzodiazepines and opioid (mu) receptors in the withdrawal symptoms of the benzodiazepines and morphine, respectively.", 
    "197": "The three-dimensional structure of the GABA A receptor that included the ligand/agonist binding site was constructed and validated by using molecular modeling technology. Moreover, the putative binding-mode of GABA and diazepam with GABAA receptor were investigated by means of docking studies. Based on an rmsd-tolerance of 1.0 angstroms, the docking of GABA to alpha1/beta2 interface resulted in three multi-member conformational clusters and model 2 was supported by homologous sequence alignment data and experimental evidence. On the other hand, the docking of diazepam to alpha1/gamma2 interface revealed five multi-member conformational clusters in the binding site and model 1 seemed to represent the correct orientation of diazepam in the binding site.", 
    "198": "Elevated zero maze is a modification of the elevated plus maze model of anxiety in rodents. The novel design comprises an elevated annular platform with two opposite, enclosed quadrants and two open quadrants, removing any ambiguity in the interpretation of the time spent in the central square of the traditional design and allowing uninterrupted exploration. In the present study, we validated elevated zero maze as a tool to study antianxiety activity, using various standard anxiolytics belonging to different pharmacological groups, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, alcohol etc., and compared the results with elevated plus maze. Bidirectional sensitivity of the model was also assessed using picrotoxin, pentylenetetrazol and flumazenil, the modulators of GABA(A) and benzodiazepine modulators. Animals were administered different standard antianxiety and anxiogenic drugs, and were allowed to explore the elevated zero maze (time spent in open arm, latency to enter in open arm, total number of entries in open arm and number of stretch attend postures [SAPs]) and elevated plus maze (time spent in open arm, latency to enter in open arm, total number of entries in open arm, first preference of the animal [open/closed] and number of stretchings). Selected drugs and doses were then assessed on the mirror chamber paradigm. Results of the present study indicated that elevated zero maze offered a better animal model to study antianxiety activity, when compared with elevated plus maze and mirror chamber.", 
    "199": "In a previous study, it was shown that the incorporation of poorly soluble drugs (BCS class II) in sugar glasses could largely increase the drug's dissolution rate [van Drooge, D.J., Hinrichs, W.L.J., Frijlink, H.W., 2004 b. Anomalous dissolution behaviour of tablets prepared from sugar glass-based solid dispersions. J. Control. Release 97, 441-452]. However, the application of this technology had little effect when high drug loads or fast dissolving sugars were applied due to uncontrolled crystallization of the drug in the near vicinity of the dissolving tablet. To solve this problem a surfactant, sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), was incorporated in the sugar glass or physically mixed with it. Diazepam and fenofibrate were used as model drugs in this study. The dissolution behavior of tablets prepared from solid dispersions in which SLS was incorporated was strongly improved. Surprisingly, the dissolution rate of tablets prepared from physical mixtures of SLS and the solid dispersion was initially fast, but slowed down after about 10 min. The solid dispersions were characterized by DSC to explain this unexpected difference. These measurements revealed the existence of interaction of SLS with both the drug and the sugar in the solid dispersion when SLS was incorporated. It is hypothesized that due to this interaction, the dissolution of SLS was slowed down by which a high solubility of the drug in the near vicinity of the dissolving tablet is maintained during the whole dissolution process. Therefore, uncontrolled crystallization is effectively prevented."
