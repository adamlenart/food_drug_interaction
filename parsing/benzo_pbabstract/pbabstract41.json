Abrupt cessation can lead to severe and life-threatening withdrawal characterized by altered mental status, autonomic dysreflexia, rigidity, and seizures. This symptomatic presentation is similar to alcohol withdrawal, which is mediated by modification of GABAA expression. Use of the \u03b12-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine for the treatment of ethanol withdrawal has been widely reported, raising the question of its potential role in baclofen withdrawal.

We investigated the electrophysiological changes in absolute theta power within the frontal cortex when individuals performed a visuomotor task under bromazepam. The sample of 17 healthy individuals was randomized into 2 experimental conditions, under which bromazepam 6 mg and placebo were administered on different days. All subjects were right -handed, with no mental or physical illness and were not using any psychoactive or psychotropic substance during the entire period of the study. We found an increase in reaction time under bromazepam compared with placebo . With regard to the electrophysiological variable, we found a lower theta power value in the prefrontal cortex prior to task execution, compared with after. We therefore suggested that this could be an increase of neural activity in this region, because of the subjects' readiness to perform the task, that is, because of their higher alertness. The right lateral frontal region showed lower theta power under bromazepam for pre- and post-finger movement. This could have occurred because of more effort to execute the task. In the left frontal region: premovement did not demonstrate any difference between conditions, possibly because the proposed task was simple to execute. In conclusion, theta power plays an important role in the analysis of visuomotor performance, assuming that bromazepam causes impairment on sustained attention and sensory perception.",

However, the location(s) of proteolytic processing and subsequent secretion of APP fragments from highly compartmentalized, euploid neurons that express APP and processing enzymes at normal levels is not well understood. To probe the behavior of endogenous APP, particularly in human neurons, we developed a system using neurons differentiated from human embryonic stem cells, cultured in microfluidic devices, to enable direct biochemical measurements from axons. Using human or mouse neurons in these devices, we measured levels of A\u03b2, sAPP\u03b1, and sAPP\u03b2 secreted solely from axons. We found that a majority of the fragments secreted from axons were processed in the soma, and many were dependent on somatic endocytosis for axonal secretion. We also observed that APP and the \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme were, for the most part, not dependent on endocytosis for axonal entry. These data establish that axonal entry and secretion of APP and its proteolytic processing products traverse different pathways in the somatodendritic compartment before axonal entry.", 
    "28": "Co-occurrence of mental disorders and substance use disorders (dual diagnosis) among doctors is a cause of serious concern due to its negative personal, professional, and social consequences. This work provides an overview of the prevalence of dual diagnosis among physicians, suggests a clinical etiological model to explain the development of dual diagnosis in doctors, and recommends some treatment strategies specifically for doctors. The most common presentation of dual diagnosis among doctors is the combination of alcohol use disorders and affective disorders. There are also high rates of self-medication with benzodiazepines, legal opiates, and amphetamines compared to the general population, and cannabis use disorders are increasing, mainly in young doctors. The prevalence of nicotine dependence varies from one country to another depending on the nature of public health policies. Emergency medicine physicians, psychiatrists, and anaesthesiologists are at higher risk for developing a substance use disorder compared with other doctors, perhaps because of their knowledge of and access to certain legal drugs. Two main pathways may lead doctors toward dual diagnosis: (a) the use of substances (often alcohol or self-prescribed drugs) as an unhealthy strategy to cope with their emotional or mental distress and (b) the use of substances for recreational or other purposes. In both cases, doctors tend to delay seeking help once a problem has been established, often for many years. Denial, minimization, and rationalization are common defense mechanisms, maybe because of the social stigma associated with mental or substance use disorders, the risk of losing employment/medical license, and a professional culture of perfectionism and denial of emotional needs or failures. Personal vulnerability interacts with these factors to increase the risk of a dual diagnosis developing in some individuals. When doctors with substance use disorders accept treatment in programs specifically designed for them (Physicians' Health Programs), they show better outcomes than the general population. However, physicians with dual diagnosis have more psychological distress and worse clinical prognosis than those with substance use disorders only. Future studies should contribute to a better comprehension of the risk and protective factors and the evidence-based treatment strategies for doctors with dual diagnosis.", 
    "29": "The external globus pallidus (GPe) is central for basal ganglia processing. It expresses muscarinic cholinergic receptors and receives cholinergic afferents from the pedunculopontine nuclei (PPN) and other regions. The role of these receptors and afferents is unknown. Muscarinic M1-type receptors are expressed by synapses from striatal projection neurons (SPNs). Because axons from SPNs project to the GPe, one hypothesis is that striatopallidal GABAergic terminals may be modulated by M1 receptors. Alternatively, some M1 receptors may be postsynaptic in some pallidal neurons. Evidence of muscarinic modulation in any of these elements would suggest that cholinergic afferents from the PPN, or other sources, could modulate the function of the GPe. In this study, we show this evidence using striatopallidal slice preparations: after field stimulation in the striatum, the cholinergic muscarinic receptor agonist muscarine significantly reduced the amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) from synapses that exhibited short-term synaptic facilitation. This inhibition was associated with significant increases in paired-pulse facilitation, and quantal content was proportional to IPSC amplitude. These actions were blocked by atropine, pirenzepine, and mamba toxin-7, suggesting that receptors involved were M1. In addition, we found that some pallidal neurons have functional postsynaptic M1 receptors. Moreover, some evoked IPSCs exhibited short-term depression and a different kind of modulation: they were indirectly modulated by muscarine via the activation of presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Thus pallidal synapses presenting distinct forms of short-term plasticity were modulated differently.",

    "42": "In this study, the practical application of Integrative Validation Therapy (IVA) in a nursing home for people with dementia was investigated and evaluated from the perspectives of professionals and relatives by using Fourth Generation Evaluation. IVA, a complex intervention frequently applied in Germany's long-term care settings, is a modification of Feil's Validation Therapy and contains a specific attitude and several components of action. The findings demonstrate that professionals as well as relatives of nursing home residents gave the intervention a positive rating. From the perspective of the participating professionals, the application of IVA results in less agitated residents which also has an influence on the consumption of benzodiazepine and neuroleptics. The authors conclude that IVA is a beneficial nursing intervention helping to facilitate the illness-related transition process of people with dementia. IVA is able to support them to cope with emotional distress during transition (e.g. irritability, anxiety, depression, changes in self-esteem). Another conclusion is that IVA supports person-centred care because, with IVA, professionals react to typical needs people with dementia have: comfort, inclusion, attachment and identity (Kitwood, 2012).", 
    "43": "Zolpidem tartrate is a non-benzodiazepine analogue of imidazopyridine of sedative and hypnotic category. It has a short half-life with usual dosage regimen being 5 mg, two times a day, or 10 mg, once daily. The duration of action is considered too short in certain circumstances. Thus, it is desirable to lengthen the duration of action. The formulation design was implemented by preparing extended-release tablets of zolpidem tartrate using the biphasic delivery system technology, where sodium starch glycolate acts as a superdisintegrant in immediate-release part and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose as a release retarding agent in extended-release core. Tablets were prepared by direct compression. Both the core and the coat contained the drug. The pre-compression blends were evaluated for angle of repose, bulk density, and compressibility index. The tablets were evaluated for thickness, hardness, weight variation test, friability, and in vitro release studies. No interaction was observed between zolpidem tartrate and excipients from the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The results of all the formulations prepared were compared with reference product Stilnoct\u00ae. Optimized formulations showed release patterns that match the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) guidelines for zolpidem tartrate extended-release tablets.

It was observed that pirenzepine inhibited the increase of diopter and extension of ocular axial length. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in pirenzepine group was significantly higher compared to the other treatment groups pointing to a highly positive correlation between TH expression levels and the diopter and axial length change. RT-PCR analysis further showed that pirenzepine treatment reduced the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2) and enhanced the expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP-2) compared to the other treatment and control groups. To conclude, we demonstrate that pirenzepine may improve the prognosis of monochromatic light-induced myopia in guinea pigs, possibly by both regulating the balance of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in sclera and increasing the TH expression in retina.",

    "50": "GABA(A) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system and are targets of clinically important drugs modulating GABA induced ion flux by interacting with distinct allosteric binding sites. ROD 185 is a previously investigated structural analogue of the GABA site antagonist bicuculline, and a positive allosteric modulator acting via the benzodiazepine binding site. Here, we investigated 13 newly synthesized structural analogues of ROD 185 for their interaction with rat GABA(A) receptors. Using [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding assays, we identified four compounds exhibiting a higher affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site than ROD 185. Two electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology at recombinant GABA(A) receptors indicated that most of these compounds positively modulated GABA-induced currents at these receptors. Additionally, these experiments revealed that this compound class not only interacts with the benzodiazepine binding site at \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 receptors but also with a novel, so far unidentified binding site present in \u03b1\u03b2 receptors. Compounds with a high affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site stimulated GABA-induced currents stronger at \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 than at \u03b1\u03b2 receptors and preferred \u03b13\u03b23\u03b32 receptors. Compounds showing equal or smaller effects at \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 compared to \u03b1\u03b2 receptors differentially interacted with various \u03b1\u03b2 or \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 receptor subtypes. Surprisingly, five of these compounds interacting with \u03b1\u03b2 receptors showed a strong stimulation at \u03b16\u03b23\u03b32 receptors. The absence of any direct effects at GABA(A) receptors, as well as their potential selectivity for receptor subtypes not being addressed by benzodiazepines, make this compound class to a starting point for the development of drugs with a possible clinical importance.",

The primary objective was to compare benzodiazepine and haloperidol utilization before and after initiation of dexmedetomidine or propofol. Secondary measures included AW and sedation scoring, analgesic use, intensive care unit length of stay, rates of intubation, and adverse events.", 
    "57": "Among the dexmedetomidine and propofol groups, significant reductions in benzodiazepine (P\u22640.0001 and P=0.043, respectively) and haloperidol (P\u22640.0001 and P=0.026, respectively) requirements were observed. These reductions were comparable between groups (P=0.933 and P=0.465, respectively). A trend toward decreased intensive care unit length of stay in the dexmedetomidine group (123.6 hours vs 156.5 hours; P=0.125) was seen. Rates of intubation (14.7% vs 100%) and time of intubation (19.9 hours vs 97.6 hours; P=0.002) were less in the dexmedetomidine group. Incidence of hypotension was 17.6% in the dexmedetomidine group vs 28.5% in the propofol group. Incidence of bradycardia was 17.6% in the dexmedetomidine group vs 0% in the propofol group. No differences were observed in other secondary outcomes.", 
    "58": "In patients with severe AW who require sedation, both dexmedetomidine and propofol have unique and advantageous properties. Both agents appear to have equivalent efficacy in reducing AW-related symptoms and benzodiazepine and haloperidol requirements. These results should be validated in a larger, prospective trial.", 
    "59": "Prolonged consumption of benzodiazepine drugs (BZD) and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone; altogether Z drugs) is related to potential physiological and psychological dependence along with other adverse effects. This study aimed to analyse the prescribing of long-acting BZD (half-life >10 hr), compared to short-acting BZD in Denmark during a 10-year period. Descriptive analysis of total sales data from the Danish Register of Medicinal Product Statistics, to individuals in the primary healthcare sector, of all BZD and Z drugs in the period of 2003-2013. Prescription data derive from all community and hospital pharmacies in Denmark. The prescribing of long-acting BZD was reduced from 25.8 defined daily doses (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/day in 2003 to 8.8 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day in 2013, a relative reduction of 66%. The prescribing of short-acting BZD was reduced from 26.1 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day in 2003 to 16.4 DDD/1000 inhabitants/day in 2013, a relative reduction of 37%. Prescription data in this study did not include information about indications for initiating treatments. In addition, due to compliance problems, some of the prescribed drugs may not have been consumed according to the prescription. The observed reduction in BZD use was correlated to the introduction of new national guidelines on prescription of addictive drugs, but this study was not designed to detect a causal relationship. The prescribing of long-acting BZD decreased considerably more than the prescribing of short-acting BZD in the 10-year period.", 
    "60": "Abstract The use of midazolam as a tranquilizer for anesthesia in mustelids in conjunction with the cyclohexamine ketamine is not well documented. Because midazolam is fast acting, inexpensive, and quickly metabolized, it may serve as a good alternative to other more commonly used tranquilizers. We trapped and anesthetized 27 Pacific martens (Martes caurina) in Lassen National Forest (northern California, US) August 2010-April 2013. We assessed anesthesia with ketamine at 18 and 25\u00a0mg/kg combined with 0.2\u00a0mg/kg of midazolam by comparing mean times of induction, return to consciousness, and recovery, plus physiologic parameters. No reversal was used for the midazolam portion of the anesthetic. Mean (\u00b1SD) induction for both ketamine dosages was 1.7\u00b10.5 and 1.8\u00b11.0\u00a0min, respectively. Return to consciousness mean times were 8.0\u00a0min longer (P<0.001) for martens receiving a 25\u00a0mg/kg ketamine dosage. Mean recoveries were 15.1\u00a0min longer (P<0.003) for the 25\u00a0mg/kg ketamine dosage. Physiologic parameter means were similar for both ketamine dosages with no statistically significant differences. Body temperatures and heart and respiratory rates were generally stable, but percentage of oxygen saturation and end tidal carbon dioxide values were below those seen in previous mustelid studies. The combination of ketamine, at both dosages, and midazolam provided reliable field anesthesia for Pacific martens, and supplemental oxygen is recommended as needed.", 
    "61": "There are no reported studies evaluating the effect of midazolam on recovery quality, recovery time or minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) at which extubation occurs (MAC extubation). Our hypotheses were that midazolam administered prior to recovery would decrease MAC extubation, prolong recovery time but provide a smoother recovery. Sixteen Yorkshire pigs were anesthetized with isoflurane for approximately 5 h. The end-tidal isoflurane concentration was then stabilized at 1.4% for 20 min. Pigs were randomly assigned to receive midazolam or saline. The vaporizer was decreased by 10% every 10 min until extubation. Pigs were declared awake by a blinded observer and were assigned a recovery score by the same observer. Mean MAC extubation was not significantly different for pigs receiving saline prior to recovery compared with those pigs receiving midazolam. The overall mean MAC extubation for both groups was 0.6 \u00b1 0.4 vol%. Time to extubation was not significantly longer with midazolam (124 \u00b1 36 min) compared with the saline group (96 \u00b1 61 min; P = 0.09). Recovery score was not significantly different between groups (midazolam, 0.86 \u00b1 1.1; saline 0.5 \u00b1 0.5; P = 0.26). In conclusion, midazolam did not affect MAC extubation. There was no advantage of administering midazolam in the recovery period when performing step-down titration of isoflurane anesthesia.", 
    "62": "The relative contribution of hepatic compared with intestinal oxidative metabolism is a crucial factor in drug oral bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. Oxidative metabolism is mediated by the cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase system to which cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) is the essential electron donor. In order to study the relative importance of these pathways in drug disposition, we have generated a novel mouse line where Cre recombinase is driven off the endogenous Cyp1a1 gene promoter; this line was then crossed on to a floxed POR mouse. A 40 mg/kg dose of the Cyp1a1 inducer 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) eliminated POR expression in both liver and small intestine, whereas treatment at 4 mg/kg led to a more targeted deletion in the liver. Using this approach, we have studied the pharmacokinetics of three probe drugs--paroxetine, midazolam, nelfinavir--and show that intestinal metabolism is a determinant of oral bioavailability for the two latter compounds. The Endogenous Reductase Locus (ERL) mouse represents a significant advance on previous POR deletion models as it allows direct comparison of hepatic and intestinal effects on drug and xenobiotic clearance using lower doses of a single Cre inducing agent, and in addition minimizes any cytotoxic effects, which may compromise interpretation of the experimental data.",

However, research has shown contradictory results regarding the suitability of pharmacological treatment for certain groups of schizophrenia patients.", 
    "64": "The present review discusses results from the literature indicating good outcomes only for patients who adhered to prescribed pharmacological treatments. It also describes studies favoring non-drug treatments in certain schizophrenic patients.", 
    "65": "The authors described two groups of patients where the long-term use of neuroleptics may be useless, if not harmful. The first group comprised schizophrenic people with a single psychotic episode and therefore very good prognosis. In their case, the prolonged use of antipsychotics would not be beneficial due to pharmacological and social (stigma) side effects. Further research is warranted to identify and investigate biological, environmental, and psychological factors associated with single-episode schizophrenia. The second group comprised ultra-resistant schizophrenic patients. In their case, in the absence of a therapeutic response in acute episodes or aggressive behavior, clinicians should use short episodes of treatment with benzodiazepines or other sedative medications such as mood stabilizers.", 
    "66": "The present paper attempted to answer the important question as to whether all schizophrenic people should be treated with antipsychotics for the same good prognosis. The authors have provided solutions for better outcomes in a greater number of patients using alternative treatment after identifying schizophrenic patients who should not receive neuroleptic treatment. Suggestions for future research are also discussed.", 
    "67": "A survey in a representative sample of the Swiss population revealed an average sleep duration of 7.5 hours on workdays and of 8.5 hours on free days, which reflected a more than half an hour (38 min) shorter sleep duration than 28 years ago. The mean time in bed was between 22:41 and 06:37 on workdays and between 23:29 and 08:27 on free days. On workdays as well as on free days the bedtime was delayed by 47 minutes in comparison to a similar survey 28 years ago. By contrast, the mean rise times on workdays and free days did not change. The sleep duration required to feel refreshed was indicated with 7 hours, which was 41 minutes less than 28 years ago. Roughly 90 % of the interviewees answered that they felt healthy, and 75 % described their sleep as good or very good compared to 79 % 28 years ago. The most frequent reasons stated for bad sleep were personal problems and strain at the workplace. The effect of bad quality sleep on every day functioning was considered as essential by 65 % of the respondents compared to 69 % 28 years ago. The use of medication to improve sleep was declared by 2.8 % (2.7 % 28 years ago), most often benzodiazepines, but also Valerian products and so-called z-drugs. In comparison with similar surveys in other countries (France, Great Britain and USA), Swiss residents slept roughly half an hour longer, but these other countries alike showed a sizable shortening of their habitual sleep duration over the last decades.",

    "69": "The clinical records of 190 patients with schizophrenia who discontinued clozapine between 1990 and 2012 in the county of Northamptonshire were examined, in an attempt to answer the following questions. Why do patients stop clozapine? What do physicians prescribe as an alternative? What is the mortality in this patient group?", 
    "70": "Patients' data were extracted using their electronic records, then analysed using descriptive statistical methods.", 
    "71": "Non-compliance with treatment, or with the mandatory white blood cell monitoring, was the most common reason (55.3%) for clozapine cessation, followed by neutropaenia and other adverse effects (25.2%). Death (mean age 48 years) was the third most common reason (10%), with respiratory infections accounting for more than a quarter of the deaths. 13% of the patients had died (mean age 49 years) at some point following clozapine discontinuation. In terms of the alternative antipsychotic prescribing, olanzapine was the most commonly prescribed (37.1%) drug in patients who were still under the care of the local psychiatric service (n=121), at the time of data extraction. Clozapine had been reinstated in 19% of these patients.", 
    "72": "Our findings are generally consistent with previous studies, and they demonstrate the need for physicians to address their patients' concerns regarding clozapine treatment, and to effectively manage any adverse effects. Sialorrhea and constipation seem to be particularly of concern, as they may be linked to clozapine- related mortality. Olanzapine was the most commonly prescribed alternative to clozapine, which suggests that it may possibly have a role in refractory schizophrenia.",

    "77": "Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are agents capable of inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in different tumour cell types. Previously, we reported a series of novel HDACi obtained by hybridizing SAHA or oxamflatin with 1,4-benzodiazepines. Some of these hybrids proved effective against haematological and solid cancer cells and, above all, compound (S)-8 has emerged for its activities in various biological systems. Here, we describe the effectiveness of (S)-8 against highly metastatic human A375 melanoma cells by using normal PIG1 melanocytes as control. (S)-8 prompted: acetylation of histones H3/H4 and \u03b1-tubulin; G0 /G1 and G2 /M cell cycle arrest by rising p21 and hypophos-phorylated RB levels; apoptosis involving the cleavage of PARP and caspase 9, BAD protein augmentation and cytochrome c release; decrease in cell motility, invasiveness and pro-angiogenic potential as shown by results of wound-healing assay, down-regulation of MMP-2 and VEGF-A/VEGF-R2, besides TIMP-1/TIMP-2 up-regulation; and also intracellular accumulation of melanin and neutral lipids. The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, but not the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, contrasted these events. Mechanistically, (S)-8 allows the disruption of cytoplasmic HDAC6-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) complex in A375 cells thus releasing the active PP1 that dephosphorylates AKT and blocks its downstream pro-survival signalling. This view is consistent with results obtained by: inhibiting PP1 with Calyculin A; using PPP1R2-transfected cells with impaired PP1 activity; monitoring drug-induced HDAC6-PP1 complex re-shuffling; and, abrogating HDAC6 expression with specific siRNA. Altogether, (S)-8 proved very effective against melanoma A375 cells, but not normal melanocytes, and safe to normal mice thus offering attractive clinical prospects for treating this aggressive malignancy.", 
    "78": "The aim of the study was to assess the magnitude of the CYP3A4 inhibitory effect of 2 dosing regimens of ketoconazole and the influence of the pharmacokinetic properties of the CYP3A4 substrate on the extent of the substrate exposure increase. For this purpose, a clinical study was conducted and PBPK modeling simulations were performed. A crossover study was conducted in healthy subjects. The study was designed to compare the effects of different regimens of reversible CYP3A4 inhibitors, i.e., ketoconazole 400 mg OD, ketoconazole 200 mg BID, on two CYP3A4 substrates, alprazolam and midazolam, reflecting different pharmacokinetic properties in terms of first-pass effect and elimination. In parallel, time-based simulations were performed using the Simcyp population-based Simulator to address the usefulness of modeling to assess interaction clinical study design with CYP3A4 substrates. Comparison of the OD versus BID regimens for ketoconazole showed an opposite trend for the 2 substrates: BID (200 mg) dosing regimen provided the maximal clearance inhibition for alprazolam, while it was OD (400 mg) dosing regimen for midazolam. However, these effects are moderate despite the well-known pharmacokinetic differences between these substrates, suggesting that these differences are not enough. In the other way round, these investigations show how two CYP3A4 substrates can be different without leading to a major impact of the ketoconazole dosing regimen. The clinical findings are consistent with the Simcyp predictions, in particular the opposite trend observed with midazolam and alprazolam and the ketoconazole dosing regimen. These clinical investigations showed the influence of the CYP3A4 substrates' pharmacokinetic properties and the relevance of ketoconazole dose regimen on the magnitude of the interaction ratios. In addition, PBPK Simcyp simulations demonstrated how they can be used to help clinical study design assessment to capture the maximum effect.", 
    "79": "The glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine displays rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD); however, the potential for adverse neurocognitive effects in this population has not received adequate study. The current study was designed to investigate the delayed neurocognitive impact of ketamine in TRD and examine baseline antidepressant response predictors in the context of a randomized controlled trial. In the current study, 62 patients (mean age = 46.2 \u00b1 12.2) with TRD free of concomitant antidepressant medication underwent neurocognitive assessments using components of the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) before and after a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg). Participants were randomized to ketamine or midazolam in a 2:1 fashion under double-blind conditions and underwent depression symptom assessments at 24, 48, 72 h, and 7 days post treatment using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Post-treatment neurocognitive assessment was conducted once at 7 days. Neurocognitive performance improved following the treatment regardless of treatment condition. There was no differential effect of treatment on neurocognitive performance and no association with antidepressant response. Slower processing speed at baseline uniquely predicted greater improvement in depression at 24 h following ketamine (t = 2.3, p = 0.027), while controlling for age, depression severity, and performance on other neurocognitive domains. In the current study, we found that ketamine was devoid of adverse neurocognitive effects at 7 days post treatment and that slower baseline processing speed was associated with greater antidepressant response. Future studies are required to further define the neurocognitive profile of ketamine in clinical samples and to identify clinically useful response moderators.", 
    "80": "Psychotic symptoms and syndromes are frequently experienced among individuals who use methamphetamine, with recent estimates of up to approximately 40 % of users affected. Although transient in a large proportion of users, acute symptoms can include agitation, violence, and delusions, and may require management in an inpatient psychiatric or other crisis intervention setting. In a subset of individuals, psychosis can recur and persist and may be difficult to distinguish from a primary psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. Differential diagnosis of primary vs. substance-induced psychotic disorders among methamphetamine users is challenging; nevertheless, with careful assessment of the temporal relationship of symptoms to methamphetamine use, aided by state-of-the art psychodiagnostic assessment instruments and use of objective indicators of recent substance use (i.e., urine toxicology assays), coupled with collateral clinical data gathered from the family or others close to the individual, diagnostic accuracy can be optimized and the individual can be appropriately matched to a plan of treatment. The pharmacological treatment of acute methamphetamine-induced psychosis may include the use of antipsychotic medications as well as benzodiazepines, although symptoms may resolve without pharmacological treatment if the user is able to achieve a period of abstinence from methamphetamine. Importantly, psychosocial treatment for methamphetamine dependence has a strong evidence base and is the optimal first-line treatment approach to reducing rates of psychosis among individuals who use methamphetamines. Prevention of methamphetamine relapse is the most direct means of preventing recurrence of psychotic symptoms and syndromes. Long-term management of individuals presenting with recurrent and persistent psychosis, even in the absence of methamphetamine use, may include both behavioral treatment to prevent resumption of methamphetamine use and pharmacological treatment targeting psychotic symptoms. In addition, treatment of co-occurring psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety is important as a means of preventing relapse to methamphetamine use, which is often triggered by associated symptoms.",

While early reports emphasized the distinctness of RDP and AHC, it is increasingly evident that these conditions represent a spectrum related to mutation of ATP1A3. Because only ten individuals from three families and one individual with a de novo pathogenic variant have been described with CAPOS syndrome to date, its phenotype is less defined; however, some features overlap with RDP and AHC as well. RDP is characterized by abrupt onset of dystonia with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); a clear rostrocaudal (face>arm>leg) topological gradient of involvement; bulbar involvement; and absence of response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset is four to 55 years. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits develop in the majority of those affected, including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS syndrome (a mnemonic for cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and five years. Some acute symptoms resolve; disease progression and severity vary.",

    "107": "Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become an indispensable analytical technique in clinical and forensic toxicology for detection and identification of potentially toxic or harmful compounds. Particularly, non-target LC-MS/MS assays enable extensive and universal screening requested in systematic toxicological analysis. An integral part of the identification process is the generation of information-rich product ion spectra which can be searched against libraries of reference mass spectra. Usually, 'data-dependent acquisition' (DDA) strategies are applied for automated data acquisition. In this study, the 'data-independent acquisition' (DIA) method 'Sequential Windowed Acquisition of All Theoretical Fragment Ion Mass Spectra' (SWATH) was combined with LC-MS/MS on a quadrupole-quadrupole-time-of-flight (QqTOF) instrument for acquiring informative high-resolution tandem mass spectra. SWATH performs data-independent fragmentation of all precursor ions entering the mass spectrometer in 21m/z isolation windows. The whole m/z range of interest is covered by continuous stepping of the isolation window. This allows numerous repeat analyses of each window during the elution of a single chromatographic peak and results in a complete fragment ion map of the sample. Compounds and samples typically encountered in forensic casework were used to assess performance characteristics of LC-MS/MS with SWATH. Our experiments clearly revealed that SWATH is a sensitive and specific identification technique. SWATH is capable of identifying more compounds at lower concentration levels than DDA does. The dynamic range of SWATH was estimated to be three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the >600,000 SWATH spectra matched led to only 408 incorrect calls (false positive rate\u2009=\u20090.06\u00a0%). Deconvolution of generated ion maps was found to be essential for unravelling the full identification power of LC-MS/MS with SWATH. With the available software, however, only semi-automated deconvolution was enabled, which rendered data interpretation a laborious and time-consuming process.",

Blood samples were collected 10 times during the 24 h test period. Plasma glucose, insulin, cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and non-esterified fatty acid levels were measured. The administration of MED + MID + KET resulted in hyperglycaemia and decreases in epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol and non-esterified fatty acid levels. FLU or 4AP alone or FLU + 4AP did not effectively antagonise the effects induced by MED + MID + KET but enhanced the hyperglycaemia. ATI alone was effective in antagonising these effects. Compared with non-ATI regimens, combinations with ATI were more effective in antagonising the effects induced by MED + MID + KET; however, ATI + FLU + 4AP caused large increases in cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations.

First-pass intubation rates in both pediatric and adult transport literature are variable as are the factors that influence intubation success. This study sought to determine risk factors for failed tracheal intubation in neonatal and pediatric transport. Methods. A retrospective chart review was performed over a 2.5-year period. Data were collected from a hospital-based neonatal/pediatric critical care transport team that transports 2,500 patients annually, serving 12,000 square miles. Patients were eligible if they were transported and tracheally intubated by the critical care transport team. Patients were categorized into two groups for data analysis: (1) no failed intubation attempts and (2) at least one failed intubation attempt. Data were tabulated using Epi Info Version 3.5.1 and analyzed using SPSSv17.0. Results. A total of 167 patients were eligible for enrollment and were cohorted by age (48% pediatric versus 52% neonatal). Neonates were more likely to require multiple attempts at intubation when compared to the pediatric population (69.6% versus 30.4%, p = 0.001). Use of benzodiazepines and neuromuscular blockade was associated with increased successful first attempt intubation rates (p = 0.001 and 0.008, respectively). Use of opiate premedication was not associated with first-attempt intubation success. The presence of comorbid condition(s) was associated with at least one failed intubation attempt (p = 0.006). Factors identified with increasing odds of at least one intubation failure included, neonatal patients (OR 3.01), tracheal tube size \u2264 2.5\u00a0mm (OR 3.78), use of an uncuffed tracheal tube (OR 6.85), and the presence of a comorbid conditions (OR 2.64). Conclusions. There were higher rates of tracheal intubation failure in transported neonates when compared to pediatric patients. This risk may be related to the lack of benzodiazepine and neuromuscular blocking agents used to facilitate intubation. The presence of a comorbid condition is associated with a higher risk of tracheal intubation failure.",

Although chemotherapy combined with Chk1 inhibition has been investigated in several cancer types in which TP53 mutation is seen, this combination treatment approach has not been studied in bladder cancer. Recently, cancer genome sequencing efforts have identified CDKN1A (p21) mutations at 14% frequency in invasive bladder cancer, co-occurring half the time with TP53 mutations. We hypothesized that combined CDKN1A-TP53 loss would make bladder cancer sensitive to combined treatment with gemcitabine and Chk1 inhibitor. Here, we show that TP53-CDKN1A double-mutant bladder cancer cell lines, 647V and RT-112, have a remarkable increase in p-Chk1 levels and G2-M arrest in response to gemcitabine treatment, with a heightened sensitivity to combination treatment with gemcitabine and either Chk1 inhibitor PF477736 or AZD7762, in comparison with other bladder cancer cell lines (either TP53 or p21 deficient). In addition, CDKN1A restoration in p21-deficient bladder cancer cells significantly reduced their sensitivity to combined treatment by protecting them from DNA damage and apoptosis. Furthermore, xenograft studies using RT-112 showed a significant synergistic effect of combined gemcitabine-PF477736 treatment on tumor growth. Our findings suggest that TP53/CDKN1A double-mutant bladder cancer cells have a unique dependence on Chk1 activity for the G2-M cell-cycle checkpoint in response to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage.

Although toxicity has been often attributed to its metabolite norbuprenorphine rather than to buprenorphine itself, in our case, norbuprenorphine was not detected in urine and bile and only in traces in blood. Moreover, the presence in blood of free buprenorphine but not of glucuronide metabolites argues for an unusual early death, at the beginning of buprenorphine metabolism. We propose that in the context of prior toxic impregnation, buprenorphine directly (and not via its metabolite norbuprenorphine) acted as a triggering factor by blocking the ventilatory response, rapidly leading to fatal respiratory depression.", 
    "156": "The 18\u2009kDa translocator protein (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, is expressed in the injured brain. It has become known as an imaging marker of \"neuroinflammation\" indicating active disease, and is best interpreted as a nondiagnostic biomarker and disease staging tool that refers to histopathology rather than disease etiology. The therapeutic potential of TSPO as a drug target is mostly based on the understanding that it is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein required for the translocation of cholesterol, which thus regulates the rate of steroid synthesis. This pivotal role together with the evolutionary conservation of TSPO has underpinned the belief that any loss or mutation of TSPO should be associated with significant physiological deficits or be outright incompatible with life. However, against prediction, full Tspo knockout mice are viable and across their lifespan do not show the phenotype expected if cholesterol transport and steroid synthesis were significantly impaired. Thus, the \"translocation\" function of TSPO remains to be better substantiated. Here, we discuss the literature before and after the introduction of the new nomenclature for TSPO and review some of the newer findings. In light of the controversy surrounding the function of TSPO, we emphasize the continued importance of identifying compounds with confirmed selectivity and suggest that TSPO expression is analyzed within specific disease contexts rather than merely equated with the reified concept of \"neuroinflammation.\"",

The plasma pool of HDL-C has been an excellent inverse predictor of cardiovascular events. However, when HDL-C concentrations have been manipulated with the use of niacin, fibric acid derivatives, and cholesteryl ester transferase protein inhibitors, there has been no improvement in outcomes in patients where the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol has been well treated with statins. Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) is one of the minor apoproteins of HDL-C, newly discovered in 1997. Circulating APOL1 is a 43-kDa protein mainly found in the HDL3 subfraction. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), mutant forms of APOL1 have been associated with rapidly progressive CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Because mutant forms of APOL1 are more prevalent in African Americans compared to Caucasians, it may explain some of the racial disparities seen in the pool of patients with ESRD in the United States. Thus, HDL-C is an important lipoprotein carrying apoproteins that play roles in vascular and kidney disease.",

One week after a banal pharyngitis and fever, the patient presented confusion and intractable clusters of seizures. Although she underwent multiple examinations investigating all possible etiologies (intracranial infection, autoimmune disease, or toxic and metabolic illness), all results were negative except a feeble positivity to Mycoplasma pneumoniae serum antibodies. SE was initially treated with benzodiazepine followed by administration of barbiturates and subsequent induction of coma because of refractory SE; different antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were given at different times in a period of 6 weeks but clinical and electroencephalographic improvements were achieved only after continuous infusion of lidocaine. When she recovered from SE, the patient developed severe psychomotor and cognitive impairment associated with cerebral atrophy. Treatment with lidocaine or other alternative drugs in cases of prolonged SE should be taken into account as soon as it becomes clear that the clinical condition is refractory to common AEDs included in available guidelines for SE treatment, to improve the bad outcome of this severe condition, at least limiting the negative effects of prolonged high metabolic demand due to continuous epileptiform activity and/or the possible negative effects of prolonged burst-suppression coma.",

The proliferation of both LN229 and T98 glioma cells, measured by MTT assay, was suppressed in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Moreover, apoptosis of both cells was significantly increased with the treatment of olanzapine as evidenced by increased Bcl-2 expression, Hoechst 33258 staining and annexinV-FITC/PI staining. Olanzapine treatment also enhanced activation of autophagy with increased expression of LC3-II, expression of protein p62, a substrate of autophagy, being decreased. The growth inhibition by olanzapine in both glioma cell lines could be blocked by co-treatment with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor. Furthermore, olanzapine effectively blocked the growth of subcutaneous xenografts of LN229 glioma cells in vivo. The increased level of protein LC3-II and decreased level of p62 followed by a decreased level of Bcl-2, suggesting that autophagy may contribute to apoptosis. In addition, reduced proliferation of glioma cells was shown by a decrease of Ki-67 staining and increased caspase-3 staining indicative of apoptosis in mouse xenografts. These results indicated that olanzapine inhibited the growth of glioma cells accompanied by induction of autophagy and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo.

KU812 cells were treated with 3 different concentrations of GSK525762A (1.0, 2.5 and 5 \u00b5mol/L) and the cell apoptosis after 72 hours were assayed by using flow cytometry. KU812 cells were treated with DMSO and 2.5 \u00b5mol/L GSK525762A, and the mRNA levels of C-MYC, BCL-2, CDK6, BCL-xL, BAK and BAX were determined by using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results showed that GSK525762A could significantly inhibit the proliferation of KU812 cells and the inhibitory effect on KU812 cell proliferation was dependent on the dose-course and time-course of GSK525762A treatment. GSK525762A treatment could induce apoptosis of KU812 cells in a dose-dependent manner. After GSK525762A treatment, the mRNA levels of proliferation-promoting genes ( C-MYC and CDK6) and pro-survival genes ( BCL-2 and BCL-xL) decreased, while the transcription level of pro-apoptosis genes BAK and BAX increased, as compared to that of the control group. It is concluded that GSK525762A can inhibit the proliferation of KU812 cells and induce cell apoptosis possibly through depressing the transcription of C-MYC, BCL-2, CDK6 and BCL-xL gene, and down-regulating BAK and BAX transcription.", 
    "180": "We investigated the ionization profiles for open-ring (OR) and closed-ring (CR) forms of midazolam and drug-binding modes with heptakis-(2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (trimethyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin; TRIMEB) using molecular modeling techniques and quantum mechanics methods. The results indicated that the total net charges for different molecular forms of midazolam tend to be cationic for OR and neutral for CR at physiological pH levels. The thermodynamic calculations demonstrated that CR is less water-soluble than OR, mainly due to the maximal solvation energy (\u0394G(CR)(solv = -9.98 kcal\u00b7mol \u207b\u00b9), which has a minimal \u0394G(OR)(solv) of -67.01 kcal\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9. A cell viability assay did not detect any signs of TRIMEB and OR/CR-TRIMEB complex toxicity on the cEND cells after 24 h of incubation in either Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium or in heat-inactivated human serum. The molecular docking studies identified the more flexible OR form of midazolam as being a better binder to TRIMEB with the fluorophenyl ring introduced inside the amphiphilic cavity of the host molecule. The OR binding affinity was confirmed by a minimal Gibbs free energy of binding (\u0394G(bind)) value of -5.57 \u00b1 0.02 kcal\u00b7mol\u207b\u00b9, an equilibrium binding constant (K(b)) of 79.89 \u00b1 2.706 \u03bcM, and a ligand efficiency index (LE(lig)) of -0.21 \u00b1 0.001.

    "182": "The metabolic side-effects of olanzapine have undermined drug compliance and increased concern for this otherwise-effective treatment for schizophrenia. As obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with low-grade inflammation, and olanzapine-induced weight gain has three typical stages, the current study investigated the inflammatory effects of olanzapine in three treatment stages. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated orally with olanzapine (1 mg/kg three times daily) or vehicle for one week, two weeks, and five weeks. Olanzapine significantly increased body weight and white visceral fat deposition in all three treatment stages compared to control. Olanzapine enhanced average adipocyte size and level of macrophage infiltration in white adipose tissue (WAT) compared to control, with levels of macrophage infiltration increased over time. There was a high correlation between adipocyte size and macrophage infiltration rate. Olanzapine also caused increased macrophage infiltration in brown adipose tissue (BAT), but not liver. Additionally, pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were upregulated by olanzapine in the hypothalamus, WAT, and BAT compared to control, but not the liver. Finally, plasma triglycerides were elevated by olanzapine compared to control, but not total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) or low density lipoprotein (LDL). These findings indicate that olanzapine-induced inflammation and adiposity are closely related, and that peripheral low-grade inflammation develops during olanzapine treatment.",

After inducing an initial amelioration, the patient had a re-exacerbation of auditory hallucinations and a clinical and psychosocial worsening, which subsided after olanzapine discontinuation. Olanzapine may induce a worsening of hallucinations in a psychotic disorder with substantial affective component and therefore its use should be carefully evaluated in such cases.",

    "186": "All treatments similarly inhibited pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. All treatments increased serum gastrin, but the combination and rabeprazole did so more than netazepide alone. The combination also reduced basal acid secretion. Rabeprazole increased plasma CgA, whereas netazepide and the combination reduced it. None of the biopsies showed enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia. Withdrawal of treatments led neither to rebound hyperacidity nor dyspepsia.", 
    "187": "Netazepide suppressed pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion as effectively as did rabeprazole. The reduction in basal acid secretion and greater increase in serum gastrin by the combination is consistent with more effective acid suppression. Despite our failure to show rabeprazole-induced ECL cell hyperplasia and rebound hyperacidity, the increase in plasma CgA after rabeprazole is consistent with a trophic effect on ECL cells, which netazepide prevented. Thus, netazepide is a potential treatment for the trophic effects of hypergastrinaemia and, with or without a PPI, is a potential treatment for acid-related conditions.",

Using the quantitative in situ brain perfusion technique, we first found lower (13.0% and 17.0%) brain transport coefficient (Clup) of [(3)H]-diazepam in APOE4 mice at 4 and 12 months, compared with APOE2 and APOE3 mice, reflecting a decrease in cerebral vascularization. Accordingly, results from immunohistofluorescence experiments revealed a structurally reduced cerebral vascularization (26% and 38%) and thinner basement membranes (30% and 35%) in 12-month-old APOE4 mice compared with APOE2 and APOE3 mice, suggesting vascular atrophy. In addition, APOE4 mice displayed a 29% reduction in [(3)H]-d-glucose transport through the BBB compared with APOE2 mice without significant changes in the expression of its transporter GLUT1 in brain capillaries. However, an increase of 41.3% of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was found in brain capillaries of 12-month-old APOE4 mice. In conclusion, profound divergences were observed between APOE genotypes at the cerebrovascular interface, suggesting that APOE4-induced BBB anomalies may contribute to AD development.", 
    "189": "Benzodiazepines are allosteric agonists of GABAA receptors (GABAAR), pentameric ligand-gated Cl(-) channels, which serve both an important neurodevelopmental role but are also the principal inhibitory system in the brain. However, their subunit composition, channel properties, and function, as well as their region-specific expression patterns, change through development. These processes have been extensively studied in rodents and to some extent confirmed in higher species. Specifically, GABAARs acquire faster kinetics with age and their pharmacology changes rendering them more sensitive to drugs that have higher affinity for \u03b11 subunit-containing GABAARs, such as benzodiazepines, but also, their inhibitory function becomes more potent as they shift from having depolarising to hyperpolarising responses due to a shift in Cl(-) gradient and cation chloride cotransporter expression. Concerns have been raised about possible pro-apoptotic and paradoxical effects of benzodiazepines in the neonatal normal rat brain, although it is unclear, as yet, whether this extends to brains exposed to seizures. Growing evidence indicates that the pharmacology and physiology of GABAARs may be altered in the brain of rats or humans with seizures or epilepsy, or different aetiologies that predispose to epilepsy. These changes follow different paths, depending on sex, age, region, cell type, aetiology, or time-point specific factors. Identification of dynamic biomarkers that could enable these changes in vivo to be monitored would greatly facilitate the selection of more effective agonists with fewer side effects.",

    "212": "The study was a retrospective review of adult patients from April 2011 to March 2014 who were administered ketamine specifically for management of AWS. Outcomes included changes in BZD requirements and ketamine-related adverse reactions.", 
    "213": "Of 235 patients screened, 23 patients met study eligibility. Ketamine was initiated primarily with toxicology consultation for significant BZD requirements or delirium tremens. The mean time to initiation of ketamine from first treatment of AWS, and total duration of therapy were 33.6 and 55.8 hours, respectively. Mean initial infusion dose and median total infusion rate during therapy were 0.21 and 0.20 mg/kg/h, respectively. There was no change in sedation or alcohol withdrawal scores in patients within 6 hours of ketamine initiation. The median change in BZD requirements at 12 and 24 hours post-ketamine initiation were -40.0 and -13.3 mg, respectively. The mean time to AWS resolution was 5.6 days. There was one documented adverse reaction of oversedation, requiring dose reduction.", 
    "214": "Ketamine appears to reduce BZD requirements and is well tolerated at low doses. Prospective dose range evaluations in the management of AWS would be helpful in determining its place as an adjunctive agent.", 
    "215": "We report a healthy teenager with involuntary nocturnal tongue biting resulting in recurrent tongue injury. Causes for tongue biting during sleep in children include seizures, bruxism, faciomandibular myoclonia, hypnic myoclonia, and rarely geniospasm, which has been described as a rare inherited movement disorder accompanied with chin quivering. In the absence of family history, we diagnosed our patient with sporadic geniospasm based on polysomnographic findings with good response to clonazepam. Geniospasm should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with unexplained tongue injury in sleep.", 
    "216": "Most antipsychotic drugs act as dopamine D2 receptor antagonists within the basal ganglia. These compounds have efficacy in the treatment of positive symptoms of schizophrenia but do not address the cognitive deficits that define this disorder. D,L-Govadine, a recently synthesized tetrahydroprotoberberine, shows efficacy on preclinical tests of antipsychotic action, as well as procognitive properties. We sought to compare D,L-govadine with two atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and olanzapine, on repeated conditioned avoidance responding (CAR), a task that has recently been utilized to model the effects of repeated antipsychotic treatment. After acquisition of two-way avoidance, rats were given D,L-govadine, clozapine, olanzapine or a vehicle control before repeated testing on CAR. Daily sessions were conducted, with 'drug-on' days spaced by a 'drug-off' test day and a rest day, for a total of five drug administrations. Consistent with previous research, the lower dose of olanzapine showed a modest but progressive increase in disruption of avoidance behaviour as observed with many antipsychotics. In contrast, repeated administration of clozapine led to tolerance, and the novel compound D,L-govadine produced a consistent effect across administrations. This stable effect of D,L-govadine on CAR may indicate a desirable preclinical profile for a candidate antipsychotic compound.", 
    "217": "The lower margin amplitude (LMA) of the amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) is suppressed in neonates during deep sedation, a feature that is attributed to the bispectral index (BIS) in adults.", 
    "218": "We compare the BIS and the LMA of the aEEG in neonates.", 
    "219": "Thirty neurologically healthy neonates between 37 and 44 weeks postmenstrual age were included in this study. Twenty patients received sedoanalgesic therapy for various reasons. BIS and aEEG recordings were performed simultaneously. The digital data were imported in the numerical software environment Matlab\u00ae. The LMA of the aEEG was computed on a 1-min time scale and synchronized with the BIS data. The correlation between the time-dependent variables BIS and LMA was estimated using the Spearman rank correlation index.", 
    "220": "The median correlation between BIS and LMA was 0.3. Inclusion of recordings of high signal quality only into analysis improved the median correlation index to 0.6.", 
    "221": "We found a light-to-moderate correlation between BIS and LMA in our study cohort and a good correlation in the subgroup with high signal quality.", 
    "222": "Clobazam (CLB) is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to yield N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB), which is further inactivated by CYP2C19. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the relationship between CYP2C19 polymorphisms and the efficacy of low-dose, add-on CLB therapy in Japanese patients with epilepsy.", 
    "223": "Fifty patients were divided into three groups according to their CYP2C19 polymorphism. CLB and N-CLB serum concentrations and seizure frequency before and after starting CLB were analyzed.", 
    "224": "Extensive metabolizers (EMs, n=11), intermediate metabolizers (IMs, n=22), and poor metabolizers (PMs, n=17) were included. Although the dose-normalized CLB serum concentrations were not significantly different, the dose-normalized N-CLB serum concentrations were significantly higher in PMs than in EMs or IMs. Seizure frequency was significantly decreased by the CLB therapy in PMs (p<0.01), but not in EMs or IMs. CLB serum concentrations did not correlate with seizure reduction rate, but median N-CLB serum concentrations were significantly higher in patients with excellent seizure control (\u2267 90 % seizure reduction) compared to those with \u226750 % seizure reduction or with <50 % seizure reduction (1103, 341, and 570 ng/mL, respectively).", 
    "225": "The efficacy of low-dose CLB therapy was significantly influenced by CYP2C19 polymorphisms. Ideally, CLB therapy should be started with a low dose (2.5 mg/day) and dosage increased until N-CLB serum concentration reaches 1100 ng/mL or until the desired effect is acquired, a recommendation that is particularly important for PMs."
