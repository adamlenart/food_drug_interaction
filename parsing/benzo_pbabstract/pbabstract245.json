The obtained complexes were evaluated for their consistency with structure-activity relationships and site-directed mutagenesis data. A comparison between the calculated interaction free energies and the experimental biological activities was also made. All the possible interactions of the investigated compounds at the active site and the probable ligand binding conformations provide an improved basis for structure-based rational ligand design. Additionally, our docking results allow a further validation and refinement of the pharmacophore model previously postulated by us.", 
    "1": "In this study, we compared haemodynamic changes, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) insertion time, and complications in patients anesthetized by inhalation of sevoflurane with those of intravenous induction with propofol. One hundred patients, aged between 20-40 years were enrolled in this study. Group 1 received propofol (2.5 mg/kg i.v.) and group 2 received sevoflurane (6%+50% N2O+50% O2) by inhalation using the tidal volume technique. LMA insertion time was found to be significantly longer in sevoflurane group than in propofol group. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly lower within each group after induction in comparison to before induction values. In both groups, the LMA was successfully inserted in all patients. The quality of anaesthesia according to patients was significantly higher in the propofol group (80%) than in sevoflurane group (30%). Odor perception was significantly higher in sevoflurane group (84%) than in propofol group (38%). Apnoea was significantly higher in propofol group (40%) than in sevoflurane group (0%). Sevoflurane is an alternative to propofol for induction of anaesthesia and has a lower incidence of apnoea. Other complication rates are not higher than which propofol but the longer duration of induction time is a disadvantage.",

    "3": "50 patients with PAF of non-rheumatic origin entered the study group, 20 healthy examinees served control. All of them were examined using a clinicocardiological, cliniconeurological tests; their autonomic nervous system, emotional sphere, sleep disorders were studied before and after clonazepam treatment in a dose 0.5 mg 2 times a day for 30 days.", 
    "4": "A positive effect of clonazepam was noted in 20 (80%) patients with PAF, less frequent paroxysms occurred in 12 (48%) patients, in 5 patients they stopped, 12 (48%) patients tolerated the paraxysms better. The paraxysms became shorter in 10 (40%) patients, 10 (40%) patients felt better in the postparoxysmal period. A marked relief of psychovegetative syndrome, improvement of activity, mood and quality of sleep were noted in all the patients.",

    "6": "EGD with conscious sedation is a safe procedure, but complications such as hypoxia can occur. The efficacy and safety of low-dose flunitrazepam (0.25 mg) was compared with a standard dose of flunitrazepam (0.5 mg) for moderate sedation during EGD.", 
    "7": "In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 75 outpatients (40 men, 35 women, mean age 45 [11] years) undergoing screening EGD were randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment arms: 0.25 mg of flunitrazepam (F0.25 group), 0.5 mg of flunitrazepam (F0.5 group), or placebo (normal saline solution), each administered intravenously. Patient tolerance was scored by using self-assessment questionnaires with visual analogue scales. Cardiopulmonary complications were assessed by monitoring blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and the electrocardiogram during the procedure.", 
    "8": "The patient tolerance scores in the F0.25 and F0.5 groups, respectively 2.1 (2.1) and 2.3 (2.5), were significantly lower than that for the placebo group (6.5 [3.0]); there was no significant difference between F0.25 and F0.5. Cardiopulmonary complications in the F0.25 group were significantly lower than in the F0.5 group. Oxygen desaturation (oxygen saturation < 90%) was noted in two of 25 patients in the F0.5 group. Post-procedure drowsiness was observed in two of 24 (8.3%) patients in the F0.25 group and 3 of 21 (14.3%) in the F0.5 group (p = 0.2438).", 
    "9": "Patient tolerance of EGD with low-dose flunitrazepam (0.25 mg intravenously) was similar to that with a standard dose (0.5 mg intravenously) and significantly better than in the placebo group. Oxygen desaturation was observed only in the group that received the standard dose, suggesting that sedation with low-dose flunitrazepam is efficacious and safe for EGD.", 
    "10": "Performance of sphincter of Oddi manometry at ERCP is technically demanding and requires that the patient be well sedated. Droperidol is frequently administered when adequate sedation cannot be achieved with a benzodiazepine and meperidine. This study examined the effects of droperidol on the biliary and pancreatic sphincters.", 
    "11": "A total of 31 patients were prospectively evaluated by sphincter of Oddi manometry in the conventional retrograde fashion. Manometry was initially performed with intravenous administration of diazepam alone, diazepam plus meperidine or midazolam plus meperidine. Manometry was then repeated 5 minutes after droperidol was administered.", 
    "12": "The basal pressure of the biliary sphincter and of the pancreatic sphincter were not significantly altered by droperidol. Concordance (normal vs. abnormal) between the basal sphincter pressure before and after droperidol was seen in 30 patients (97%). Droperidol also did not lead to a difference in phasic wave amplitude, duration, or frequency. Thirteen manometry tracings (42%) were judged as being qualitatively better after droperidol, whereas two (6.5%; </= p 0.001) were qualitatively better before droperidol administration.", 
    "13": "Droperidol does not significantly affect sphincter of Oddi manometric parameters. It appears that it can be added to the armamentarium of agents needed for performance of sphincter of Oddi manometry. However, further study is needed to determine whether recent safety concerns with droperidol use are valid.", 
    "14": "Droperidol increasingly is used as an effective adjunct for conscious sedation during endoscopic procedures. Given the concern for the effects of narcotics and benzodiazepines on sphincter of Oddi motility, and the potential difficulty in sedating patients undergoing sphincter of Oddi manometry, droperidol could be an ideal agent in this setting.", 
    "15": "Over a 43-month period, consecutive patients undergoing sphincter of Oddi manometry were studied prospectively. Sphincter of Oddi manometry was performed under general anesthesia in all but 10 patients. Standard retrograde pull-through techniques were used to examine the biliary and/or pancreatic sphincter, depending on the indication for sphincter of Oddi manometry. After the initial two pull-throughs, 5 mg of droperidol were given intravenously and measurements were repeated 5 minutes later.", 
    "16": "A total of 55 patients were studied (42 women [76%], 13 men; mean age 43 years). The basal biliary sphincter pressures measured in 35 patients before and after droperidol were, respectively, 56 mm Hg and 48 mm Hg (p = 0.02); the basal pancreatic sphincter pressures measured in 22 patients before and after droperidol were, respectively, 92 mm Hg and 67 mm Hg (p = 0.29). By using a definition for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction of a basal pressure greater than 40 mm Hg, droperidol would have resulted in a change in diagnosis in 5 patients undergoing biliary manometry (one misclassified as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, 4 misclassified as normal), and 6 patients undergoing pancreatic sphincter manometry (5 misclassified as sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, one misclassified as normal) (total 19% of procedures). No complication was associated with droperidol use.", 
    "17": "Droperidol alters basal sphincter pressures, which in some patients was clinically significant and would have resulted in misclassification. Although safe and well tolerated, droperidol appears to have subtle but clinically significant effects on the sphincter of Oddi.",

    "19": "A retrospective review of all maternal/neonatal records of pregnancies that were maintained on methadone therapy in our institution was conducted. After in-hospital stabilization, women were given daily methadone therapy under direct surveillance, with liberal dosage increases according to maternal withdrawal symptoms. Neonatal withdrawal was assessed objectively by the neonatal abstinence score. The average methadone dose in the last 12 weeks of pregnancy and the last methadone dose before delivery (cutoffs of 40, 60, or 80 mg) were correlated to various objective measures of neonatal withdrawal.", 
    "20": "One hundred mother/neonate pairs on methadone therapy were identified. Women who received an average methadone dose of <80 mg (n=50 women) had a trend toward a higher incidence of illicit drug abuse before delivery than women who received doses of >/=80 mg (n=50 women; 48% vs 32%; P=.1). Women who received an average methadone dose of <80 mg had similar highest neonatal abstinence score, need for neonatal treatment for withdrawal, and duration of withdrawal compared with women whose condition was maintained with dosages of >/=80 mg (score, 11.1 vs 11.5; 68% vs 66%; and 13.3 vs 13.6 days, respectively; all P>.5). For all cutoffs that were used for high versus low dose and for both the average and last methadone dosage analyses, neonatal withdrawal was similar.", 
    "21": "The maternal methadone dosage does not correlate with neonatal withdrawal; therefore, maternal benefits of effective methadone dosing are not offset by neonatal harm.", 
    "22": "Delirium tremens (DT) is a clinical condition that appears in some patients affected by severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). DT represents a serious complication, being characterized by elevated morbidity and mortality. Benzodiazepines are presently the drug of choice; however their use is related to several side effects. Baclofen is a stereoselective gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAB) receptor agonist. Recent studies show that baclofen is able to suppress alcohol withdrawal symptoms. At present there are no data on the effects of baclofen administration in AWS complicated by DT. Here, we report a case of DT successfully treated with baclofen. This result indicates that the efficacy of baclofen in the treatment of DT should be examined in future clinical trials.", 
    "23": "Pretreatment with imipramine, buspirone, or placebo was compared in 40 patients meeting the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition criteria for panic disorder and in patients who were discontinuing long-term benzodiazepine use. The average duration of benzodiazepine use was 75 +/- 64 months, and the average benzodiazepine intake expressed as diazepam equivalents was 25.7 +/- 19 mg/d. We hypothesized that pretreatment with either imipramine or buspirone, in contrast to pretreatment with placebo, would lead to a significant decrease of symptoms of anxiety and depression before tapering benzodiazepines, thus making the taper process easier to complete. All 3 treatments (imipramine, buspirone, and placebo) caused a reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms as measured by changes in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Neither discontinuation severity nor taper-free status 12 weeks posttaper differed between the 3 treatment groups.", 
    "24": "The behavioral and neurochemical effects of switching from typical to atypical medications have not been evaluated in the rodent models of tardive dyskinesia. Thus, we treated rats with haloperidol-decanoate for 12 weeks, and assessed the effects of additional treatment with olanzapine, haloperidol, clozapine, or vehicle on vacuous chewing movements and expression of transcripts for dopamine receptors, tyrosine hydroxylase, delta-opioid receptor, prodynorphin, preproenkephalin, glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-65) and GAD-67 and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits in the striatum and its efferent pathways. Haloperidol-decanoate induced vacuous chewing movements extinguished following an additional 4 weeks of treatment with vehicle, olanzapine or haloperidol, but not clozapine. Post-treatment, vacuous chewing movements in the clozapine group were significantly higher than the vehicle, olanzapine and haloperidol groups. GAD-67 mRNA expression in the globus pallidus was decreased following additional treatment with olanzapine or haloperidol, but not clozapine. Changes in expression of other transcripts were not detected. These findings demonstrate important differences in the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics on chronic vacuous chewing movements.",

    "28": "EMIT(R) screening yielded 117 (22.1%) positive samples, a number which increased to 174 (32.8%) after GC-MS analysis. Of these 174 GC-MS positive samples, 119 (68.4%) contained one benzodiazepine while for the remaining samples multiple benzodiazepine (mis)use could be demonstrated. A significant increase in benzodiazepine (mis)use was indicated only from day 0 to day 14 based on the GC-MS results but not on the immunoassay results, even when the latter were complemented with GC-MS analysis of the positively screened samples. The GC-MS data also demonstrated that benzodiazepines are mainly (mis)used by subjects on benzodiazepine prescription as almost 50% of these subjects took additional non-prescribed benzodiazepines. During GC-MS analysis other drugs were co-extracted unintentionally and chromatographed and 23.9% of the volunteers were positive for illegal drugs on the day of arrival.", 
    "29": "Immunoassay results yield an underestimation of the problem of benzodiazepine (mis)use in prison due to the high false negative rate. GC-MS analysis of all samples therefore is the recommended strategy for this type of longitudinal study as it yields more correct and detailed information than the immunoassay results.", 
    "30": "The non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zolpidem and zopiclone, which are indicated for short-term treatment of insomnia, were considered originally by physicians as almost devoid of abuse and dependence potential. Several recent publications, however, have suggested that both agents carry a significant risk of abuse. To substantiate and re-evaluate this situation, the world literature was reviewed for cases of dependence of both agents; these cases were analysed in order to identify certain underlying patterns, if evident.", 
    "31": "A systematic review based on a Medline literature search was conducted including the years 1966-2002 to assemble all available clinical case reports that were analysed for typical features of abuse and dependence according to prespecified criteria. Only case reports were of interest, and clinical studies were excluded. No limitations as to language or publication year were applied. The terms 'zolpidem', 'zopiclone' and 'abuse', 'dependence', 'addiction', 'withdrawal' and 'intoxication' were used to identify relevant publications. Potentially relevant citations were retrieved and assessed for inclusion independently by two authors.", 
    "32": "A total of 36 cases for zolpidem were identified, most of them reported in recent years, and 22 cases for zopiclone. Both sexes were involved to a similar extent; and cases were reported in all age groups. In extreme cases, dose increases reached a factor of 30-120 above the recommended doses. The majority of patients had a history of former drug or alcohol abuse and/or other psychiatric conditions.", 
    "33": "On the basis of world-wide prescription numbers, which are approximately twofold higher for zolpidem (1,338,774,000 tablets from June 2001 to June 2002 in Europe, Japan and United States) than for zopiclone (664,897,000 tablets during the same period in Europe and Japan), the relative incidence of reported dependence similar for both drugs and remarkably lower than that of benzodiazepines used for the treatment of disturbed sleep. The findings offer the conclusion that zolpidem and zopiclone are relatively safe drugs. However, as both drugs are psychotropic drugs, patients with a history of abuse or dependence and those with psychiatric diseases seem to be at increased risk of abuse of these agents.", 
    "34": "The success of intravenous platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor blockers as potent antithrombotic therapies has ignited interest in the research and development of oral agents with the intention of extending the initial clinical benefits proven with intravenous GP IIb/IIIa blockers to long-term care with the use of oral agents. Nonetheless, results of the recently published Blockade of the Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Receptor to Avoid Vascular Occlusion (BRAVO) trial support the disappointing results of the earlier published studies, which revealed that the use of oral GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors was associated with an unacceptable increased mortality. Further research to elucidate the mechanism of this increased fatality risk is warranted before any further clinical studies with the oral GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors can be ethically justified.",

    "38": "At the time of their switch, the average patient age was 53.2 years (range 25-83). The average weight change in patients switched to olanzapine (n = 47) was +2.3 kg (p = 0.01) and the BMI change was +0.8 kg/m(2) (p = 0.02). The average percent body weight change was +2.8% and the BMI change was +3.0%. The average weight change after patients switched to risperidone (n = 39) was -0.45 kg (p = 0.69) and BMI change was -0.2 kg/m2 (p = 0.64). The average percentage weight change was -0.4% and BMI change was -0.5%.", 
    "39": "Practitioners' concern regarding weight changes after switching atypical antipsychotics seems warranted and patients should be provided consistent, ongoing weight monitoring. Further investigations should examine whether weight changes associated with atypical antipsychotic treatment further jeopardize this already at-risk population for severe comorbid conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes.", 
    "40": "Bromazepam, an anti-anxiety agent, has been reported to be metabolized by cytochrome P(450) (CYP).

The purpose of this study was to examine whether the inhibition of CYP3A4 produced by itraconazole alters the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bromazepam.", 
    "41": "Eight healthy male volunteers participated in this randomized double-blind crossover study. The subjects received a 6-day treatment of itraconazole (200 mg daily) or its placebo. On day 4 of the treatment, each subject received a single oral dose of bromazepam (3 mg). Blood samplings for drug assay were performed up to 70 h after bromazepam administration. The time course of the pharmacodynamic effects of bromazepam on the central nervous system was assessed using a subjective rating of sedation, continuous number addition test and electroencephalography up to 21.5 h after bromazepam administration.", 
    "42": "Itraconazole caused no significant changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bromazepam. The mean (+/-SD) values of area under the plasma concentration-time curve and elimination half-life for placebo versus itraconazole were 1328+/-330 ng h/ml versus 1445+/-419 ng h/ml and 32.1+/-9.3 h versus 31.1+/-8.4 h, respectively.", 
    "43": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of bromazepam were not affected by itraconazole, suggesting that CYP3A4 is not involved in the metabolism of bromazepam to a major extent. It is likely that bromazepam can be used in the usual doses for patients receiving itraconazole or other CYP3A4 inhibitors.", 
    "44": "The aim of the present study was to map out what kind of psychotropic drugs are prescribed for elderly residents in assisted-living homes and how they relate to age, sex, form of living, psychiatric diagnosis, care needs and mental health status, and to identify factors of importance for their use; and to study the indication for treatment and the evaluation of the effects of treatment.", 
    "45": "The study had a cross-sectional design and included one-third of all patients ( n=175) living in old-age homes or in nursing homes in a municipality in southern Sweden. Data concerning medication was obtained from medical records and included all psychotropic drugs prescribed the day the study started and the previous month. Need of care was assessed using Katz index, and mental health status was assessed using the Organic Brain Syndrome scale.", 
    "46": "Of the study population, 128 (73%) used one or more psychoactive drug. Prescribed drugs were neuroleptics (16%), anxiolytics (32%), hypnotics, (45%), and anti-depressants (33%). A greater prescription of neuroleptics than anti-depressants was seen for those showing signs of depression, and caution with prescription of benzodiazepines was seen for those showing signs of dementia. An indication and evaluation of treatment was lacking in half of the cases. Treatment with psychiatric drugs existed for approximately 50% of those without a determined psychiatric diagnosis.", 
    "47": "We have found a frequent use of neuroleptics, anxiolytics and hypnotics in the elderly, but an underprescription of anti-depressants appears to exist. There is a lack of documentation of indications and evaluations of psychotropic medication.", 
    "48": "Mibefradil, a calcium channel blocker, was removed from the market because of adverse drug interactions with coadministered CYP3A4 substrates. This study examined the effect of mibefradil on the activity of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4 in vivo, employing the erythromycin breath test (EBT) and oral midazolam pharmacokinetics. This was a two-period, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in which 8 male volunteers were randomized to the order of receiving placebo and a single 100-mg oral dose of mibefradil. Oral midazolam was coadministered with intravenous [14C N-methyl] erythromycin 1 hour after mibefradil/placebo administration. The EBT was performed 20 minutes following erythromycin administration. Blood and urine were collected during the 36 hours following probe drug administration for analysis of midazolam pharmacokinetics. Coadministration of mibefradil increased the Cmax of midazolam 3-fold, the AUC 8- to 9-fold, and the t1/2 4-fold. Mibefradil coadministration decreased the amount of exhaled 14CO2 in 6 of 8 subjects, with a mean decrease of 25%. It was concluded that a single oral dose of mibefradil significantly inhibits CYP3A4 in intestine and liver. These data support that adverse drug interactions involving mibefradil reflect inhibition of CYP3A4 in intestine and liver. Also, they suggest that the EBT, while a valid probe of in vivo hepatic CYP3A4 activity, is a single time point measurement and may be less sensitive than oral midazolam pharmacokinetics in detecting CYP3A4 inhibition.",

They efficiently prevent and treat vomiting induced by anticancer drugs with high and very high emetogenic effect. They have been used as monotherapy or in combination with corticoids. In the treatment of nausea and vomiting or vomiting induced by anticancer drugs with medium or light emetogenic effect, antiemetic preparations from the corticoid series and dopamine receptor antagonists may be recommended. In the treatment of anticipation vomiting, benzodiazepines are indicated for their anxiolytic and psychosedative influence.", 
    "52": "CYP3A activity in adults varies between individuals and it has been suggested that this has a genetic basis, possibly related to variant alleles in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 genes. Accordingly, genotype-phenotype associations were investigated under constitutive and induced conditions. Midazolam's systemic and oral clearances, and the erythromycin breath test (ERBT) were determined in 57 healthy subjects: 23 (11 men, 12 women) European- and 34 (14 men, 20 women) African-Americans. Studies were undertaken in the basal state and after 14-15 days pretreatment with rifampin. DNA was characterized for the common polymorphisms CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3, CYP3A5*6 and CYP3A5*7 by direct sequencing, and for exon 21 and exon 26 variants of MDR1 by allele-specific, real-time polymerase chain reaction. In 95% of subjects, the basal systemic clearance of midazolam was unimodally distributed and variability was less than four-fold whereas, in 98% of the study population, oral clearance varied five-fold. No population or sex-related differences were apparent. Similar findings were observed with the ERBT. Rifampin pretreatment markedly increased the systemic (two-fold) and oral clearance (16-fold) of midazolam, and the ERBT (two-fold) but the variabilities were unchanged. No associations were noted between these phenotypic measures and any of the studied genotypes, except for oral clearance and its fold-increase after rifampin. These were related to the presence of CYP3A4*1B and the inversely linked CYP3A5*3 polymorphism, with the extent of induction being approximately 50% greater in CYP3A5*3 homozygotes compared to wild-type subjects. In most healthy subjects, variability in intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity, using midazolam as an in-vivo probe, is modest and common polymorphisms in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 do not appear to have important functional significance.", 
    "53": "Intraoperative bleeding is one of the major problems in endoscopic surgery of sinuses. In the case of the expanded process, still more numerous interventions are performed with general anesthesia. The objective of research is to compare intraoperative hemorrhage and the visibility of the operative field during normotension and hypotension anesthesia caused by nitroglycerin and captopril when performing endoscopic operations of accessory nasal sinuses. Fifty-two patients of physical health state 1-2 according to ASA were examined: for 32 the controlled hypotension (Group H) was applied, 20 patients underwent operations in normotension (Group N). All patients on the eve of the operation were premedicated with diazepam; Group H patients on the day of operation received 6.25 mg of captopril. Anesthesia was carried out with fentanyl and halothane steam in the 50:50% mixture of oxygen and laughing gas. In Group H arterial blood pressure was lowered by nitroglycerin infusion. The average arterial blood pressure was maintained in GroupH within the limits of 50-60 mmHg. Hypotension was coordinated with the rising of the head-bed of the operating table at 5 degrees. Hemorrhage was measured by collecting blood with the pump graded with the precision of 25 ml. The visibility of the operative field was evaluated subjectively every 15 minutes according to the scale of 5 points proposed by Fromm. In both groups the average arterial blood pressure values as well as the values of the frequency of heart contractions differed statistically significantly. In the hypotensive group, hemorrhage during operation was less, on the average, (208 ml) than in Group N (349.2 ml). The visibility of the operative field was by one point, on the average, better than in Group H. No anesthetic complications were observed during investigation. In summary, it is possible to state that the controlled arterial hypotension caused by captopril and nitroglycerin reduced significantly intraoperative hemorrhage and improved the visibility of the operative field in endoscopic rhinosurgery.",

Among them, 39% had prescriptions for conventional antipsychotics, 37% for atypical antipsychotics, and 23% for both atypical and conventional antipsychotics. Use of any atypical agent during the year was less likely for Hispanic veterans (55%) than for two other groups (both 61%). When examining specific medications in a multivariate model, the authors found that African American and Hispanic veterans were much less likely to receive clozapine than were white veterans.", 
    "57": "Overall use of atypical antipsychotics was slightly less common for African American and Hispanic veterans with schizophrenia than for white patients. However, use of clozapine, the first choice for refractory illness and possibly uniquely effective for patients with comorbid substance abuse, did vary greatly by race. This may reflect concern over serious side effects, such as loss of white blood cells and fluctuations of serum glucose levels, or patient preference.",

The present experiment with healthy subjects investigated the residual effects of taking a single night-time dose of hypnotics on collision anticipation capacities the next morning. Visual sequences simulated the movement of a driver approaching an intersection where another vehicle was arriving. Ten participants had to estimate, as quickly as possible, whether the other vehicle would arrive before or after them at the intersection. They were tested after having taken a capsule of zolpidem (10 mg), zopiclone (7.5 mg), flunitrazepam (1 mg) or a placebo. The results show no residual effects of the molecules. Only flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine with a long half-life, appears to cause subjects to focus their attention on an element which, while relevant for the task (a road sign playing the role of a spatial reference), is not used correctly.", 
    "61": "Systemic injections of alcohol have previously been reported to 'prime' or to reinstate self-administration of alcohol in rats, and it has been suggested that the priming effects of drugs are related to their stimulus properties. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the effects of lorazepam, which cross-generalizes with alcohol in animal drug-discrimination studies, in rats trained to self-administer 7% alcohol in an operant paradigm. Once animals were trained, extinction tests were carried out twice weekly, before which rats were injected with either vehicle, alcohol (0.063-0.5 g/kg, i.p.) or lorazepam (0.03-0.25 mg/kg, i.p.). Alcohol did not increase responding for alcohol during extinction. Doses of 0.25 and 0.5 g/kg reduced alcohol-appropriate lever pressing (p < 0.05 versus 0 g/kg), with the largest dose also suppressing general activity (p < 0.02 versus 0 g/kg). Lorazepam also reduced alcohol-appropriate responding, in a behaviourally specific manner; doses of 0.03 mg/kg and above decreased lever pressing (p < 0.05 versus 0 mg/kg), whereas general activity was depressed at 0.06 mg/kg and larger doses (p < 0.05 versus 0 mg/kg). Although lorazepam mimicked the effect of alcohol at doses predicted to do so on the basis of their relative potency in drug discrimination studies, neither alcohol nor lorazepam primed rats to respond for alcohol. By contrast, the pattern of results suggested that, in this model, they 'satiated' or substituted for alcohol, resulting in a reduced motivation to respond.", 
    "62": "Despite the widespread application of combined selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and benzodiazepine treatment for panic disorder, there has been relatively little systematic assessment of the safety and efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. Although the limited number of studies to date suggest a more rapid onset of benefit with combined treatment, this study is the first to address the critical question of whether continued combined treatment confers superior efficacy. This study is a randomized, double-blind, three-arm study in patients with panic disorder (n = 60), comparing the efficacy and safety of paroxetine and placebo (PP), paroxetine coadministered with clonazepam followed by a tapered benzodiazepine discontinuation phase (PC-D), and ongoing combination treatment (PC-M). All treatment groups demonstrated significant improvement by endpoint. There was a significant advantage for the combined treatment groups early in treatment but, subsequently, outcome in all three groups was similar. A trend towards greater achievement of endpoint remission status for the PC-D group was attenuated when variability in baseline severity was considered. The results of this study should be interpreted in the context of a relatively moderate sample size and higher rates of early dropout. Combined treatment with paroxetine and clonazepam resulted in more rapid response than with the SSRI alone, but there was no differential benefit beyond the initial few weeks of therapy. Initiating combined treatment followed by benzodiazepine taper after a few weeks may provide early benefit while avoiding the potential adverse consequences of long-term combination therapy.", 
    "63": "Midazolam and its active metabolites have a depressant effect on respiration and consciousness level, and therefore their effects should be considered in all patients for whom brain death testing is contemplated. The concentrations of midazolam and its active metabolites were measured in critically ill patients on a ventilator during and after continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam. Three days after cessation of midazolam infusion, the concentrations of midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam decreased to below the therapeutic range (100-1000 ng/ml) in all patients, although the concentrations of 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide remained extremely high in a patient who showed deteriorating renal function. The concentrations of 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide (19,497-29,761 ng/ml) were measured in this patient. When it is impossible to confirm factors consistent with irreversible brain death, such as the lack of cerebral blood flow, until 3 days after cessation of midazolam infusion, monitoring of the concentration of these substances should be carried out in all patients in whom suspicion exists prior to the evaluation of brain death. It is particularly imperative that monitoring of the 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide concentration be carried out in patients with poor renal function.",

    "72": "The effects of diazepam on optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) eye movements were studied under closed-loop and open-loop conditions in healthy humans. The open-loop condition was achieved by adding the eye-movement velocity signal of OKN to the computer-generated signal controlling the moving stimulus grating. Each of four subjects received a single oral dose of 5 mg diazepam or a placebo on two separate days in a double-blind randomized fashion. OKN eye movements were measured 90 min after administration of the treatments. As compared to placebo, diazepam significantly reduced the gain of open-loop OKN, but did not modify the gain of closed-loop OKN. The results indicate that the OKN gain under the open-loop condition is a more sensitive detector of the parameter changes of the OKN system than under the closed-loop condition. Thus, open-loop OKN gain can provide an objective, quantitative measure of benzodiazepine agonist effects.",

A team of professionals not involved with the patient's assistance performed a daily collection of all data up to the 28th day under mechanical ventilation (maximum length of follow up for those who remain longer under mechanical ventilation). The main outcome was the infusion doses of morphine, fentanyl, ketamine and midazolam administered at 12 AM (considering this dose as the average dose for that day).

Here we report that a specific form of perceptual learning is influenced by GABAergic mechanisms. We induced perceptual learning by Hebbian co-activation of the skin of the tip of the right index fingers in human subjects. Under placebo conditions, tactile 2-point discrimination was improved on the co-activated, but not on the left, index finger. This augmentation was completely eliminated by lorazepam, a GABAA receptor agonist. No drug effects were found on the left index finger indicating that the drugs had no effect per se on performance. The results demonstrate that perceptual learning is subject to pharmacological gating by basic mechanisms known to mediate and modulate synaptic plasticity.",

    "87": "We report two adult patients with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, manifesting as gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria. For both, the clinical presentation included significant behavioral disturbances and psychosis (hallucinations, disabling anxiety, aggressive behavior, and sleep disorder), leading to multiple therapeutic attempts. Intervention with benzodiazepines appeared most efficacious, resulting in decreased aggression and agitation and improvement in anxiety. A review of 56 published and unpublished studies of SSADH-deficient patients revealed that 42% manifested behavioral disturbances, whereas 13% (predominantly adults) displayed psychotic symptomatology. To explore the potential biochemical basis of these behavioral abnormalities, we studied cerebrospinal fluid derived from 13 patients, which revealed significantly elevated GHB (65- to 230-fold), high free and total GABA (up to threefold), and low glutamine. Although within the control range, homovanillic and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acids (end products of dopamine and serotonin metabolism, respectively) showed a significant linear correlation with increasing GHB concentration, suggesting enhanced dopamine and serotonin turnover. We conclude that elevated GABA combined with low glutamine suggest disruption of the glial-neuronal glutamine/GABA/glutamate shuttle necessary for replenishment of neuronal neurotransmitters, whereas altered dopamine and serotonin metabolism may be causally linked to the hyperkinetic movement disorders and behavioral disturbances seen in SSADH-deficient patients.", 
    "88": "The effects of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, their ionotropic agonists and antagonists on hydra's ectodermal and endodermal pacemaker systems were studied. GABA decreased ectodermal body contraction bursts (CBs) and the number of pulses in a burst (P/CB) and endodermal rhythmic potentials (RPs); tentacle pulses (TPs) were not affected. The GABA(A) agonist, muscimol, and the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam, mimicked the effects of GABA on the endodermal system. The GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline counteracted GABA's effects. Low concentrations of glutamate increased CBs and RPs. Higher concentrations required concanavalin A (Con A) to produce the same effect on CBs and P/CB. TPs were increased by high concentrations of glutamate and kainate. The ionotropic glutamate agonist, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) also required Con A to increase CBs and RPs. The effects of AMPA were antagonized by 6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX), which, per se, decreased CBs. The results indicate that GABA and glutamate, acting on their ionotropic receptors, modify the impulses of hydra's pacemaker systems. On the whole GABA decreased the outputs of both ectodermal and endodermal impulse generating systems, while glutamate increased them.",

The purpose of this report is to review the problem of diabetes mellitus associated with atypical anti-psychotic use from an endocrinology perspective. This paper will specifically present (a) a review of the increased prevalence of diabetes in the setting of schizophrenia, (b) a compilation and critical assessment of the existing publications that have documented the association of hyperglycemia and atypical anti-psychotic use, (c) a discussion of the potential mechanisms through which antipsychotics may lead to disturbances in glucose homeostasis, and (d) recommendations for the effective monitoring and treatment of affected patients.", 
    "90": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are emerging as important modulators of brain physiopathology. Dramatic changes in the expression of MMPs and TIMPs occur during excitotoxic/neuroinflammatory processes. However, only the measurement of net protease activity is relevant physiologically, and the functional consequences of MMP/TIMP ratio modifications in the brain remain elusive. In order to assess MMP activity and effects in brain tissue, we combined in vivo and organotypic culture models of kainate (KA)-induced excitotoxicity to provoke selective neuronal death and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. Using in situ zymography, we show that KA-induced excitotoxic seizures in rats increase net MMP activity in hippocampal neurons 8 h after seizures, before their death, and that this increase is neuronal activity-dependent. Three days after KA, proteolytic activity increases in blood vessels and reactive glial cells of vulnerable areas, in relation with neuroinflammation. At 7 and 15 days, proteolysis remains high in blood vessels whereas it is reduced in glia. In organotypic hippocampal cultures, which lack blood cell-mediated inflammation and extrinsic connections, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of MMPs (MMPI), but also a selective MMP-9 inhibitor, protect hippocampal neurons against KA-induced excitotoxicity. Moreover, recombinant MMP-9, but not MMP-2, induces selective pyramidal cell death in these cultures and KA-induced neuronal activity exacerbates the neuronal death promoting effects of MMP-9. These data strongly implicate MMPs, and MMP-9 in particular, in both excitotoxic neuronal damage and subsequent neuroinflammatory processes, and suggest that selective MMPIs could be therapeutically relevant in related neurological disorders.", 
    "91": "GABAA receptors are activated via low-affinity binding sites for the agonists GABA or muscimol. Evidence has been provided that the amino acid residue alpha 1F64 located at the beta2(+)/alpha1(-) subunit interface forms part of this binding site. In radioactive ligand binding studies the agonist [3H]muscimol has been found to interact with the receptor via a high-affinity binding site. This site has been interpreted as a conformational variant of the low-affinity site. Alternatively, the high-affinity binding site has been located to the alpha1(+)/beta2(-) interface and the homologous residue to alpha 1F64, beta 2Y62 has been proposed to constitute an important part of this site. Here we investigated the effect of the point mutation alpha 1F64L and the homologous mutation beta 2Y62L on agonist and antagonist binding and functional properties in alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 GABAA receptors. While the mutation in the alpha1 subunit had drastic consequences on all studied properties, including desensitization, the mutation in the beta2 subunit had little consequence. Our observations are relevant for the relative location of high- and low-affinity agonist sites in GABAA receptors.",

    "96": "It is estimated that Angelman syndrome (AS) accounts for up to 6% of all children presenting with severe mental retardation and epilepsy. The main clinical features of AS may not be apparent early in life. Clinical findings present in all patients include developmental delay, which becomes apparent by 6-12 months of age, severely impaired expressive language, ataxic gait, tremulousness of limbs, and a typical behavioral profile, including a happy demeanor, hypermotoric behavior, and low attention span. Seizures, abnormal electroencephalography, microcephaly, and scoliosis are observed in >80% of patients. Approximately 70% of patients show a deletion involving the maternally inherited chromosome 15q11-q13, encompassing a cluster of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit genes, 3% show chromosome 15 paternal uniparental disomy (UPD), 1% harbor a mutation in the imprinting center (a transcriptional regulatory element), and 6% harbor intragenic mutations of the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) gene. Twenty percent of patients have no detectable genetic abnormality. Rare cases of familial recurrence of AS show either imprinting center (IC) or UBE3A mutations. Approximately 75% of cases are detected through the methylation test, which allows the detection of AS due to deletions, UPD and IC mutations. Mutation analysis of the UBE3A gene should be performed when the methylation test is negative. Individuals with chromosome 15q11-q13 deletions have a more severe clinical picture and are more prone to develop severe epilepsy. Epilepsy has typical features, including absence and myoclonic seizures, and insidious episodes of nonconvulsive or subtle myoclonic status which are easily overlooked as children appear apathetic or in a state of neurologic regression. Tremulousness, present in all patients even when seizures are well controlled or absent, is related to distal cortical myoclonus. Valproic acid (sodium valproate), benzodiazepines, and ethosuximide, in various combinations, are quite effective in treating the typical seizure types. Piracetam may help in reducing distal myoclonus. Carbamazepine and vigabatrin may seriously aggravate absence and myoclonic seizures and should be avoided. Cognitive, language, and orthopedic problems must be addressed with vigorous rehabilitation programs, including early physical therapy, which may help to develop communicative skills and prevent severe scoliosis and subsequent immobility. Where these treatment strategies are applied, individuals with AS may reach an appreciable level of integration, self care, and have a normal life span.",

After switch from conventional neuroleptics to olanzapine patients showed an increase of gait velocity (p < or = 0.01) and step length (p < or = 0.01) whereas the cadence remained stable. Significant differences between the untreated state and treatment with olanzapine were not detectable. We conclude that bipedal gait is affected by conventional neuroleptic treatment.

The aim of our study was to investigate these supposed effects regarding clinically relevant endocrinologic symptoms under routine treatment conditions with newer, atypical antipsychotics. Our findings confirm that amisulpride frequently leads to a remarkable elevation of prolactin plasma concentration, same--in minor degree--for risperidone. Under treatment with quetiapine and olanzapine just temporary elevated prolactin levels were registered. However, no correlation between prolactin levels and dosage could be found.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of vigabatrin on the anticonvulsant activity of valproate, ethosuximide and clonazepam against pentetrazole-induced seizures in mice. In addition, the effects of antiepileptic drugs alone or in combination with vigabatrin were studied on motor performance and long-term memory. Chemical seizures were induced by subcutaneous injection of pentetrazole at its CD(97) and defined as a clonus of the whole body with an accompanying loss of righting reflex, lasting for over 3 s. Vigabatrin inhibited the clonic pentetrazole-induced seizures and ED(30) of the drug was 879 mg/kg. Vigabatrin (at the subthreshold dose of 250 mg/kg) potentiated the protective activity of ethosuximide, reducing its ED(30) from 142 to 95 mg/kg against clonic seizures induced by pentetrazole, but simultaneously elevated its plasma level. The protective activity of valproate and clonazepam remained almost unchanged. However, vigabatrin (250 mg/kg) decreased TD(30) (50% toxic dose - corresponding to the impairment of motor coordination in 50% of the animals) of ethosuximide and clonazepam from 549 and 3.84 to 460 and 1.1 mg/kg, respectively, in the chimney test. Vigabatrin (250 mg/kg) did not influence TD(30) value of valproate in this test. Vigabatrin (at the dose of 250 mg/kg) did not impair long-term memory in combination with antiepileptics. Potentiation of the ethosuximide's protective activity was apparently due to a pharmacokinetic interaction. Consequently, no pharmacodynamic interactions between vigabatrin and the studied conventional antiepileptic drugs were evident.",

BUs were significantly more often positive on serum antibodies to hepatitis C (anti-HCV), and scored significantly higher on Hamilton's Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) and Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the history of psychiatric hospitalization, history of illicit drug use, history of unemployment, symptoms of anxiety, and anti-HCV positivity were independently associated with BZD use in this prison. Medical and psychiatric interventions focusing on anxiety problems, depression, drug addiction, and HCV in this group of BUs are warranted.",

Single dose intake in non-daily users only influenced 3 subtests and observations after adjustment for blood benzodiazepine concentration and background variables. Romberg's test, 1 observation concerning alertness (oriented for time and place), 4 tests on motor and coordination (walk and turn on line, finger-to-nose and finger-to-finger tests), 2 observations on speech (articulation and content) and 1 observation regarding appearance (general conduct) were related to blood benzodiazepine concentrations.", 
    "124": "Many of these simple clinical tests are included in the standardized field sobriety test and are of value in revealing benzodiazepine impairment. The present study offered some possible additions. Combinations of these robust tests can also be used to reveal benzodiazepine inebriation in other contexts.", 
    "125": "In women with epilepsy, seizures can be influenced by variations in sex hormone secretion during the menstrual cycle. The proconvulsant effects of estrogen have been demonstrated in both animals and humans, whereas progesterone has been found to have anticonvulsant properties. Catamenial epilepsy affects approximately one-third of women with epilepsy. This type of epilepsy has generally been defined as an increase in seizure frequency beginning immediately before or during menses. However, three distinct patterns of catamenial epilepsy have been described: perimenstrual, periovulatory, and luteal. The diagnosis of catamenial epilepsy can be made through careful assessment of menstrual and seizure diaries and characterization of cycle type and duration. A variety of therapies for catamenial epilepsy have been proposed, including acetazolamide, cyclical use of benzodiazepines or conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and hormonal therapy. However, evidence for the effectiveness of these treatment approaches comes from small, unblinded series or anecdotal reports. Larger multicenter trials, as well as further investigation of the pathophysiology of the disorder, are needed to identify the most effective treatment for women with catamenial epilepsy.", 
    "126": "A 47-yr-old woman underwent general anaesthesia for a squint correction. She had previously suffered a cerebral venous thrombosis, presenting as grand mal seizures during recovery from general anaesthesia for minor surgery. Subsequently, she was affected by Jacksonian limb seizures and petit mal epilepsy and had required long-term rehabilitation, and anticonvulsant and anticoagulant therapy. On arrival in recovery on this occasion, with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in place, she started to convulse. The seizures were initially treated with midazolam i.v., but they recurred. Whilst observing the seizure pattern and excluding the differential diagnoses, evidence emerged that psychological factors had played a large part in her clinical picture. Her differential diagnosis had recently been amended to include 'pseudoseizures'. A firm, supportive approach caused the 'convulsions' to cease within a few hours.", 
    "127": "The efficacy of lofexidine/naloxone was compared with lofexidine/placebo in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 89 opiate-dependent patients. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the proportion of patients completing detoxification or in the length of stay. Patients in the active naloxone group demonstrated gradual reductions in levels of withdrawal and craving over the detoxification period. At completion of detoxification, patients who received naloxone maintained a level of withdrawal consistently lower than that in the placebo group; however, naloxone did not substantially accelerate the resolution of the withdrawal syndrome. Implications for future research are discussed.", 
    "128": "Adsorption isotherms for the diazepam-activated carbon system in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF), without pancreatin, and in SIF with different percentages of ethanol were determined as were the solubilities of diazepam in SIF and in SIF with different percentages of ethanol. The surface area of the activated carbon was also evaluated. The results from the experimental work provided information on the relationship between adsorption and solubility. An excellent logarithmic relationship was observed between the adsorption affinity and the solubility of diazepam in the ethanol-SIF mixtures. This relationship was explained by a linear relationship between the differential free energy of displacement and the differential free energy of solution. Excellent correlations were also observed between the amounts of diazepam adsorbed by activated carbon and the solubilities of diazepam in the ethanol-SIF mixtures. This relationship was used to predict the complete isotherm, which was in excellent agreement with the experimental work.",

Sci. 2000, 40, 847-858] was applied to assess anti-HIV activity for large data sets for three families of compounds: 1-[2-hydroxyethoxy)methyl]-6-(phenylthio)thymine (HEPT) derivatives, tetrahydroimidazobenzodiazepinone (TIBO) derivatives, and cyclic urea (CU) derivatives. The SMF method uses 49 types of topological descriptors (atom/bond sequences and \"augmented atoms\") which, being coupled with 3 linear and nonlinear fitting equations, allows the user to generate up to 147 structure-property models. For each family of compounds, the modeling was performed on several training sets followed by the validation calculations where three best fit models were applied. Calculated activities well reproduce available experimental data. On the basis of the \"optimal\" molecular fragments, the focused combinatorial library containing 252 virtual HEPT derivatives has been generated. Its filtering led to several hits potentially possessing anti-HIV activity.",

The potential energy surface as the function of two important rotatable dihedral angles of the 9-Cl TIBO side chain was generated by the Hartree-Fock method at the 3-21G basis set. Eight pronounced local minima were found to exist within an energy difference of less than 10 kJ/mol. The energy barriers between the different local minima are lower than 15 kJ/mol. A second derivative (frequency) analysis showed that all conformers are stable at this level of theory. These structures were used as starting points for full geometry optimizations at the HF/6-31G and B3LYP/6-31G levels of theory to obtain the absolute geometries and structural information. The comparisons of calculated conformers with the bound conformer in the X-ray structure were sequentially considered. Additionally, to obtain some structural information and to correlate between calculated structures and the structure in solution, NMR chemical shift calculations were also performed on all eight local minimum structures at B3LYP/6-311++G level, using the GIAO approach. The calculated (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR chemical shifts for the lowest energetic conformer give the greatest correspondence with the experimental results.", 
    "131": "Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) has been a recognized complication of general anesthesia after the first case reports in the 1940's. Since then a great deal has been discovered about the genetics, pathophysiology and treatment of this once fatal syndrome. MH is the only clinical entity specifically related to and caused by anesthetic agents. MH once triggered during anesthesia results in a profound hyper metabolic state with rise in the core temperature, increased carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption. Death will ensue if specific treatment is not started. The incidence of fulminant MH ranges from 1:62,000 to 1: 84,000 of general anesthesia cases if succinylcholine and inhalation agents are used. Massseter muscle spasm on induction of anesthesia, with an incidence of between 1:16,000 and 1:4,000, may be a predromal indication of the development of MH. Anesthetic agents, which may trigger MH in susceptible individuals, are the depolarizing muscle relaxant, succinyl choline and all the volatile anesthetic gasses. Nitrous oxide, intravenous induction agents, benzodiazepines, opioids, and the non-depolarizing relaxants do not trigger MH. MH susceptibility is associated with certain disorders, such as Duchene muscular dystrophy, and triggering agent should not be used in these patients. Inheritance is an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. The pathogenesis of MH involves the loss of control of intracellular calcium ions in skeletal muscle with resultant protracted spasm and hyper metabolism. Clinically this will progress to hypercarbia, hypoxia, hyperthermia, hyperkalemia and death will result if specific treatment is not started. Management involves immediate discontinuation of the triggering anesthetics, hyperventilation with 100% oxygen and most importantly the definitive treatment with intravenous dantrolene.The importance of instigating the use of dantrolene in cases of MH cannot be overemphasized. MH is now treatable when once it would be fatal before the availability of dantrolene. Unless of an emergent nature, surgery should be canceled following the acute phase of MH. The patient should be admitted to intensive care for at least 24 hours and dantrolene continued as recurrence has been described. It is imperative that the patient and their family are counseled, Medalert bracelets provided and registration with the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States (MHAUS), encouraged. The caffeine/halothane testing of muscle biopsies is currently the most definitive test for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The routine use in suspected cases or the immediate family of known cases remains a matter of contention.", 
    "132": "Convergent data suggest that SP, through the activation of neurokinin1 receptors (NK1-R), may be involved in anxiety. In particular, NK1-R antagonists have been reported to exert anxiolytic-like effects in a variety of animal procedures in which anxiety-related behaviour is induced by novelty. The present study investigated the effects of acute blockade of NK1-R in conflict paradigms, another category of anxiety-related procedures, in which positively reinforced responses are suppressed by contingent punishment. For this purpose, three selective antagonists with nanomolar affinity for rat NK1-R, GR205171, RP67580 and [2-cyclopropoxy-5-(5-(trifluoromethyl)tetrazol-1-yl)benzyl]-(2-phenylpiperidin-3-yl)amine (Compound L), were tested in the safety signal withdrawal operant paradigm. In this procedure, suppression of lever pressing for food was induced by the withdrawal of a conditioned signal for safety, with no presentation of a conditioned signal for punishment, and no punishment. Compound L was also tested in the punished drinking test, which consists of the contingent delivery of electric footshocks upon water drinking. As expected, the reference compound, diazepam (2 mg/kg s.c.), induced an anxiolytic-like effect, as indicated by significant increases of the number of responses emitted during conflict period in the operant procedure, and footshocks received in the drinking test. In contrast, GR205171 (10 mg/kg s.c.), RP67580 (0.25-8 mg/kg s.c.) and Compound L (10 and 30 mg/kg s.c.) failed to release lever pressing during the operant conflict period. In addition, punished drinking was not affected by Compound L (3-30 mg/kg s.c.). These data show that NK1-R blockade has no anxiolytic-like effects in conflict paradigms, thereby suggesting that the anxiolytic properties of NK1-R antagonists are less broad than those reported for benzodiazepines.", 
    "133": "We investigated the social behavioural effects of a single exposure to either social defeat or electric shocks, using the recently developed social avoidance test in rats. The testing apparatus consisted of two connected chambers, one of which contained an unfamiliar male confined in a sub-chamber by a perforated Plexiglas wall. The subjects were placed in the empty chamber and, after 3 min of habituation, were allowed to explore the apparatus for 5 min. The latency, frequency and duration of visits made to the opponent-containing chamber were recorded. Both stressors reduced the exploration of the opponent-containing chamber for more than 5 days. The effects of electric shocks were not affected by housing conditions, whereas group housing protected rats from the long-term effects of defeat. In addition, the effects of social defeat in isolated rats lasted longer than the effects of electric shocks. These differences suggest that the two stressors have qualitatively different effects and may model different behavioural states in humans. In a second experiment, social avoidance induced by electric shocks was readily abolished by both chlordiazepoxide and buspirone. We suggest that the shock-induced social avoidance paradigm may become a useful model of stress-induced anxiety.", 
    "134": "In an effort to clarify the mechanism of action of isoflurane, we studied the effect of flumazenil on mice chronically treated with isoflurane or diazepam. Mice were pretreated with diazepam, isoflurane, or saline, with and without flumazenil. After 2 wk, responses to isoflurane and diazepam were assessed, and central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) binding characteristics were assayed. Mice pretreated with isoflurane failed the horizontal wire test at a larger isoflurane concentration (0.5%) compared with saline-pretreated mice (0.4%) (P < 0.05). These differences did not occur when flumazenil was added to the pretreatment. After the administration of diazepam, 20% of diazepam- and 11% of isoflurane-pretreated mice failed the horizontal wire test, versus 50% and 44% when flumazenil was added to either drug (P < 0.002) and 80% and 100% in the saline and saline plus flumazenil-treated mice. The increased CBR density due to flumazenil was attenuated by the coadministration of isoflurane or diazepam. Flumazenil attenuated the development of tolerance to diazepam after chronic treatment with diazepam or isoflurane and attenuated the development of tolerance to isoflurane. Isoflurane, like diazepam, attenuated the effect of flumazenil on CBR ligand binding. These findings suggest that isoflurane shares a mechanism of action with diazepam, probably via the gamma-aminobutyric acid system, most probably the CBR.",

    "136": "Studies of the acoustic startle response and of its inhibition by the presentation of a non-startling preliminary stimulus (prepulse inhibition, PPI) have revealed deficits in PPI in schizophrenic subjects compared to healthy controls. Animal studies indicate that atypical antipsychotics improve PPI deficits induced by NMDA antagonists more consistently than typical antipsychotics. The effect of medication status on PPI in schizophrenia is unresolved in the literature. In the current study the effects on PPI of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol were compared to the unmedicated state in subjects with schizophrenia. In a between-group design, 11 schizophrenic subjects on olanzapine, 16 subjects on haloperidol, and 14 subjects who were on no medication received acoustic startle testing with PPI determination. ANOVAs revealed no significant differences in startle to pulse alone stimuli, habituation of startle, or PPI between the olanzapine, haloperidol and unmedicated groups. These 41 subjects with schizophrenia were compared to a group of 21 historical healthy controls and found to have reduced PPI. These data do not indicate a preferential effect of olanzapine compared to haloperidol on sensorimotor gating in schizophrenia. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that PPI impairments are relatively stable across treatment conditions.",

We also examined the metabolism of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 in the brain tissue of mice and rats. The analytical method used in this study permitted detection of even extremely low levels of radioactivity (approximately 5,000 dpm). In vitro experiments revealed that [(11)C]Ro15-4513 in the blood was metabolized to hydrolysate [(11)C]A. The species were classified in descending order of the metabolic rate of the radiotracer in vitro as follows; mice, rats, and monkeys/humans. In the in vitro experiment, the percentage of the unchanged drug in the plasma at 60 minutes postdose was 9% in mice, 70% in rats, 97% in monkeys, and 98% in humans. In vivo metabolite analysis in the blood showed the presence of two radioactive metabolites, consisting of one hydrolysate [(11)C]A and another unidentified substance. The species were classified in descending order of the metabolic rate of the radiotracer in vivo as follows; mice, rats/humans, and monkeys. The percentage of the unchanged drug in the plasma was 6% in mice, 21% in rats, 26% in humans, and 40% in monkeys. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo experiments conducted to analyze the metabolism of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 in the brain tissue of mice and rats revealed that the radiotracer was metabolized to some extent in the brain tissue of these animals. In the in vivo experiment, the percentage of the unchanged drug at 60 min postdose was 86% in the brain tissue of mice and 88% in the brain tissue of rats, while in the in vitro experiment, the corresponding percentage was 93% in mice, and 91% in rats.",

In this study, [18F]FEF kinetic data were acquired using a 60-min two-injection protocol on three normal subjects and two patients suffering from mesiotemporal epilepsy as demonstrated by abnormal magnetic resonance imaging and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. First, a tracer bolus injection was performed and [18F]FEF rapidly distributed in the brain according to the known BZ receptor distribution. Thirty minutes later a displacement injection of 0.01 mg/kg of unlabelled flumazenil was performed. Activity was rapidly displaced from all BZ receptor regions demonstrating the specific binding of [18F]FEF. No displacement was observed in the pons.

Two different synthesis routes are described, and it was found that the in situ modification of a plain silica rod column turned out to be the best. The chromatographic behaviour of the beta-cyclodextrin silica rod was studied and compared with a very similar commercially available beta-cyclodextrin bonded particulate material (ChiraDex). Even if the amount of beta-cyclodextrin bound to the silica rod was only about half of the amount of beta-cyclodextrin bound to ChiraDex) particles, good resolutions were achieved for a set of chiral test components like Chromakalin, Prominal, Oxazepam, Methadone and some other drugs.

    "158": "In many cells, ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP channels) couple metabolic state to excitability. In pancreatic beta cells, for example, this coupling regulates insulin release. Although KATP channels are abundantly expressed in the brain, their physiological role and the factors that regulate them are poorly understood. One potential regulator is H2O2. We reported previously that dopamine (DA) release in the striatum is modulated by endogenous H2O2, generated downstream from glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-receptor activation. Here we investigated whether H2O2-sensitive KATP channels contribute to DA-release modulation by glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This question is important because DA-glutamate interactions underlie brain functions, including motor control and cognition. Synaptic DA release was evoked by using local electrical stimulation in slices of guinea pig striatum and monitored in real time with carbon-fiber microelectrodes and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry. The KATP-channel antagonist glibenclamide abolished the H2O2-dependent increase in DA release usually seen with AMPA-receptor blockade by GYKI-52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride] and the decrease in DA release seen with GABA-type-A-receptor blockade by picrotoxin. In contrast, 5-hydroxydecanoate, a mitochondrial KATP-channel blocker, was ineffective, as were sulpiride, a D2-receptor antagonist, and tertiapin, a G protein-coupled K+-channel inhibitor. Diazoxide, a sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1)selective KATP-channel opener, prevented DA modulation by H2O2, glutamate, and GABA, whereas cromakalim, a SUR2-selective opener, did not. Thus, endogenous H2O2 activates SUR1-containing KATP channels in the plasma membrane to inhibit DA release. These data not only demonstrate that KATP channels can modulate CNS transmitter release in response to fast-synaptic transmission but also introduce H2O2 as a KATP-channel regulator.", 
    "159": "The present study was designed to investigate the effect of U50488H, a prototype non-peptide kappa opioid agonist on convulsive behaviour using a maximal electroshock (MES) seizure test in mice. An attempt was also made to explore the role of possible receptors involved. MES seizures were induced via transauricular electrodes (60 mA, 0.2 s). Seizure severity was evaluated by means of two parameters, i.e., (1). duration of tonic hindlimb extensor phase and (2). mortality due to convulsions. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of U50488H dose dependently (5-20 mg/kg) decreased the hindlimb extensor phase of MES. The anticonvulsant effect of U50488H was attenuated by the general opioid antagonist, naloxone at a high dose, and by MR2266, a selective kappa antagonist, but not by naltrindole, a delta antagonist. Coadministration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic drugs (diazepam, GABA, muscimol, and baclofen) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, dizocilpine (MK801), with U50488H augmented the anticonvulsant effect of the latter drug in mice. On the other hand, flumazenil, a central benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist, reversed the protective effect of diazepam and similarly, delta-aminovaleric acid (DAVA), a GABA(B) receptor antagonist, blocked the protective effect of baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist on the anti-MES action of U50488H. These BZD-GABAergic antagonists, namely, flumazenil or DAVA, on their own also counteracted the anti-electroshock seizure effect of U50488H given alone. However, mortality was not significantly altered in any of the above animal groups. Taken together, the findings have shown a possible role for multitude of important neurotransmitter systems, i.e., opioid (kappa), NMDA channel, GABA(A)-BZD-chloride channel complex, and GABA(B) receptors in the anticonvulsant action of U50488H.", 
    "160": "The effect of the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam on gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor-mediated currents was investigated in neurons acutely dissociated from the rat sacral dorsal commissural nucleus (SDCN) using the nystatin-perforated patch-recording configuration under voltage-clamp conditions. Midazolam displayed a biphasic effect on GABA responses. Low concentrations of midazolam (1nM-10 microM) reversibly potentiated GABA (3 microM)-activated Cl(-) currents (I(GABA)) in a bell-shaped manner, with the maximal facilitary effect at 0.1 microM; whereas at higher concentrations (above 10 microM), midazolam had an antagonistic effect on I(GABA). Our further study indicated that midazolam changed GABA(A) receptor affinity to GABA and the effects of midazolam on I(GABA) were voltage-independent. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, abolished the facilitary effect of low concentrations of midazolam rather than the antagonism of I(GABA) induced by high doses of midazolam. In addition, activation of protein kinase C prevented the inhibitory effect of midazolam at higher concentrations, but did not influence the effect of midazolam at low concentrations. These results indicate that midazolam interacts with another distinct site other than the central benzodiazepine receptors on GABA(A) receptors as an antagonist at higher concentrations in SDCN neurons.", 
    "161": "A 13-year-old boy patient had severe mental retardation and spastic quadriplegia due to fetal distress and hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in the perinatal period. He suffered from West syndrome at the age of 7 months, and subsequently was diagnosed as having symptomatic localization-related epilepsy. His intractable epileptic seizures were not controlled by combination of various antiepileptic drugs. After prescribing nitrazepam and zonisamide for more than 1 year, we added clobazam (CLB), which has been marketed in Japan since 2000, to this combination therapy. After the introduction of CLB, tonic seizures disappeared. However, gelastic seizures laughing with a stiff face and a wry mouth appeared frequently before falling asleep, and sleep disturbance worsened subsequently. It has not been reported previously that gelastic seizures are a side effect of CLB, although irritability and sleep disturbance have been described.", 
    "162": "Methadon maintenance therapy with opiate addicts who suffer from a comorbid schizophrenia in an outpatient treatment setting of a psychiatric hospital is described. We examined five patients looking for periods of inpatient treatment, drug free urine tests, social integration and illegal activities before and after neuroleptic treatment. In comparison with standard neuroleptics patients show under the therapy with atypical neuroleptics better outcome in drug urine tests especially concerning cannabis and benzodiazepines. According to these findings, the best improvements seem to occur with a combination of methadone and clozapine.", 
    "163": "While for some diseases with hyperthyreosis psychotic developments are well known, for a rare autoimmune thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, only one case of development of psychotic symptoms is known. In this case-study we present a 42-year-old white female who was admitted to hospital showing symptoms of acute psychosis. The results of the laboratory examinations showed the constellation of beginning Hashimoto's thyroiditis in hyperthyreotic state with high level of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies and comparatively low level of anti-TSH receptor antibodies. The patient recovered well in 4-weeks time under therapy with neuroleptics and benzodiazepines.", 
    "164": "The objectives of this study were to describe the use of benzodiazepines in the elderly and to identify socio-demographic and medical factors associated with this use.", 
    "165": "Data on the use of sedative and sleeping drugs were collected from a self-reported questionnaire, in a sample of 1265 elderly subjects (aged 60 to 70 years) interviewed at the first follow-up examination of the EVA Study (Epidemiology of Vascular Aging Study).", 
    "166": "Use of sedative or sleeping drugs was reported by 28.7% of the participants and use of benzodiazepines by 23%. Most of the benzodiazepines used (71%) had anxiolytic indications, 48% were long-acting compounds (elimination half-life>=20 h.). Among benzodiazepine users, 71% reported using benzodiazepines daily and 77% reported they had been taking benzodiazepines for at least 2 years. Nearly two third of the benzodiazepine users reported taking their medications as prescribed. When they were not compliant, they took benzodiazepines less often and/or at slighter doses than prescribed. Use of benzodiazepines was associated with symptoms of depression or anxiety (women: odds-ratio=2.6 [1.7-4.1]; men: odds-ratio=4.4 [2.4-7.8]) and with regular use of at least three non-psychotropic drugs (women: odds-ratio=2.0 [1.4-2.9]; men: odds-ratio=1.8 [1.1-3.1]). Women with a high educational level or with moderate alcohol consumption were less likely to take benzodiazepines; these associations were not found in men.", 
    "167": "The present study shows that benzodiazepines are the sedative and sleeping drugs most widely used by the elderly. Nearly three quarters of benzodiazepine users were chronic users.",

    "170": "Open-label crossover study with fixed treatment order conducted March 2002 to February 2003 in a US general clinical research center involving 12 healthy volunteers (6 men and 6 women) aged 22 to 38 years before and after 14 days of administration of St John's wort.", 
    "171": "Participants were given probe drugs (30 mg of dextromethorphan and 2 mg of alprazolam) to establish baseline CYP 3A4 and CYP 2D6 activity. After a minimum 7-day washout period, participants began taking one 300-mg tablet 3 times per day. After 14 days of St John's wort administration, participants were given the probe drugs along with 1 St John's wort tablet to establish postadministration CYP activity; the St John's wort dosing regimen was continued for 48 hours.", 
    "172": "Changes in plasma pharmacokinetics of alprazolam as a probe for CYP 3A4 activity and the ratio of dextromethorphan to its metabolite, dextrorphan, in urine as a probe for CYP 2D6 activity.", 
    "173": "A 2-fold decrease in the area under the curve for alprazolam plasma concentration vs time (P<.001) and a 2-fold increase in alprazolam clearance (P<.001) were observed following St John's wort administration. Alprazolam elimination half-life was shortened from a mean (SD) of 12.4 (3.9) hours to 6.0 (2.4) hours (P<.001). The mean (SD) urinary ratio of dextromethorphan to its metabolite was 0.006 (0.010) at baseline and 0.014 (0.025) after St John's wort administration (P =.26).", 
    "174": "A 14-day course of St John's wort administration significantly induced the activity of CYP 3A4 as measured by changes in alprazolam pharmacokinetics. This suggests that long-term administration of St John's wort may result in diminished clinical effectiveness or increased dosage requirements for all CYP 3A4 substrates, which represent at least 50% of all marketed medications.", 
    "175": "Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, which include mGlu1-8 receptors, are a heterogeneous family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that function to modulate neuronal excitation and plasticity via pre-synaptic, post-synaptic and glial mechanisms. Agonists for group II mGlu receptors (mGlu2 and mGlu3), such as LY354740, have been shown to suppress enhanced glutamatergic excitations in brain synapses known to be involved in the expression of fear/anxiety in animals and humans. Systemic administration of LY354740 increases open-arm time in the elevated plus maze in mice under conditions of moderate to severe stress, blocks the expression but not development of fear-potentiated startle in rats, prevents lactate-induced panic-like responses in panic-prone rats, and attenuates certain physiological, behavioral, and neurochemical consequences of acute stress in rodents. In these preclinical models, LY354740 does not produce the side-effects (e.g. sedation) that are associated with other anxiolytic agents such as benzodiazepines. Early clinical results with LY354740 have demonstrated safety and efficacy in a human anxiety model (panic provocation induced by CO2 challenge). Collectively, these data indicate mGlu2/3 receptor agonists such as LY354740 represent a promising new approach for treatment of anxiety and stress-related disorders in humans.", 
    "176": "Glycine-derived 1,4-benzodiazepine-2-ones such as diazepam are chiral by virtue of the boat-shaped conformation of the diazepine ring and exist as a racemic mixture of conformational enantiomers. However, the presence of a chiral center at C-3 of the benzodiazepine perturbs this equilibrium and preferentially stabilizes one ring conformer. We report that N-i-Pr 1,4-benzodiazepine-2-ones derived from (S)-Ala and (S)-Phe can be deprotonated and alkylated in 86-99% ee, despite the fact that the original chiral center is destroyed in the deprotonation step. We attribute this highly enantioselective alkylation to the chiral memory of the benzodiazepine ring. This protocol provides easy access to the previously unexplored \"quaternary\" 1,4-benzodiazepine-2-ones.", 
    "177": "There have been recent reports in the psychiatric literature of the possible association of glucose dysregulation and diabetes mellitus with the use of atypical antipsychotics. This article describes a retrospective chart review of patients from various clinical settings, including a continuing day treatment program, two inpatient programs, and a large private practice. Information was obtained with regard to weight, fasting blood glucose, lipid profiles, EKG changes, and medical comorbidities. The patients included those treated with conventional antipsychotic agents, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine. No one antipsychotic agent was associated with a statistically significantly higher prevalence of diabetes, lipid abnormalities, or EKG problems. It was noted, however, that there were higher rates of diabetes (17%), lipid abnormalities (43%), and hypertension (30%) across the sample. This finding suggests that the high prevalence of diabetes, lipid abnormalities, and hypertension in a young, chronically psychiatrically ill population makes the case for aggressive screening.", 
    "178": "To describe the clinical practices on the treatment of mania in a Brazilian hospital, and to compare them to other international similar reports and practice guidelines.", 
    "179": "Chart revision of 425 consecutive admissions (269 patients) for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes (ICD-10 criteria) in a private psychiatric hospital of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, from 1996 to 2000. The rates of utilization of each antimanic medication and ECT were compared to those reported in similar international observational studies (X2, bicaudate, alpha =0.05).", 
    "180": "The observed frequencies of use of each treatment modality were: lithium (71.5%); carbamazepine (34.8%); valproate (9.4%); antipsychotics (83.3%); benzodiazepines (62.4%); antidepressants (7.5%) and ECT (33.2%). The differences detected between local practice and international guidelines were: lower rate of valproate and higher rate of carbamazepine prescription; the use of sine wave devices for ECT; frequent concomitant use of ECT with lithium (72.3%), benzodiazepines (46.8%) and/or carbamazepine (31.2%).", 
    "181": "These results suggest the need to develop national practice guidelines for the treatment of mania and for the use of ECT, and to promote their propagation through specific medical educational programs, aiming at the standardization of practices based on the available scientific evidence.", 
    "182": "The objective of the present investigation was to characterize the pharmacodynamic interaction between the synthetic neuroactive steroid alphaxalone and the benzodiazepine midazolam. The time course of the electroencephalographic (EEG) effect (11.5-30 Hz) was determined in rats in conjunction with plasma concentrations. Alphaxalone was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion of 0, 1.2, 2.2, or 5.2 mg over 360 min. Midazolam was administered as a 5-min intravenous bolus infusion of 4 mg.kg-1. The pharmacokinetic profiles of both drugs were described by a two-compartment model. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed. The EEG effect versus time profiles of midazolam and alphaxalone, when administered separately and in combination, were modeled on the basis of the recently proposed mechanism-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for GABAA receptor modulators, which contains separate expressions to describe the drug-receptor interaction and the stimulus-response relationship. The pharmacodynamic interaction between alphaxalone and midazolam was best characterized using an independent drug-drug interaction model without an expression for allosteric modulation of the effect of midazolam by alphaxalone. The final model contained an exponential expression to account for acute functional adaptation to the EEG effect upon continuous infusion of alphaxalone. The mechanism-based analysis showed that this functional adaptation is best explained by a change in the system-specific stimulus-response relationship, rather than the drug-receptor activation process. It is concluded that the pharmacodynamic interaction between alphaxalone and midazolam in vivo is best described using an independent interaction model without allosteric modulation.", 
    "183": "In the last few years topics related to sleep in children have aroused increased interest. Most hypnotic drugs and sedatives used to treat adult insomnia are not recommended in children. Even so, 56% of pediatricians use medication to treat childhood sleep disorders. We review the different causes of insomnia in children from birth to school age. The various therapeutic options are discussed and the therapeutic methods that have been demonstrated to be most effective in the various types of insomnia. The most frequent hypnotic drugs used in insomnia treatment are benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics such as imidazopyridine, pyrazolopyrimidine and cyclopyrrolone. Few studies have been published on the use of melatonin in insomnia although several reports suggest that is useful and relatively safe in the treatment of insomnia in school-aged children. In children with insomnia, pediatricians should first of all obtain information about the characteristics of insomnia and the environmental characteristics surrounding the child and his/her family. Once an organic cause has been ruled out, treatment should be based on informing the parents about sleep physiology and on training them in sleep hygiene and the acquisition of sleep habits. When pharmacological treatment is required, it should be carefully selected using the smallest effective doses. Melatonin seems to have a promising future in insomnia treatment in healthy children and in those with neurological disorders.", 
    "184": "Previous work in our department, prior to the advent of digital subtraction angiography, showed that anaesthetist-administered sedation for cerebral angiography using propofol infusion-bolus fentanyl resulted in significantly more patients with early recall than a bolus fentanyl and midazolam technique. Our present study reassessed, 10 yr after our original study, the effectiveness of sedation for neuroradiological digital subtraction cerebral angiography, using three techniques currently in use in the department.", 
    "185": "A total of 88 adult patients were sedated for neuroradiological angiograms by one of three anaesthetist-administered regimens: propofol-alfentanil infusion; boluses of fentanyl with a propofol infusion and boluses of fentanyl and midazolam. The latter two regimens had been used in our previous sedation study. Patients were assessed for time to orientation at the completion of the procedure, and followed up the next day to determine their last memory before sedation, first memory after the angiogram and any recall of the procedure itself.", 
    "186": "All three techniques were found to give satisfactory sedation and showed minimal difference in the time to orientation at the end of the procedure (3.7, 4.3 and 5.1 min), any awareness of the procedure itself (20% of patients overall) and numbers of patients having early recall; that is, recall of still being in the radiology department before return to the ward (22/29, 16/29 and 20/30).", 
    "187": "Our results show that since the introduction of digital subtraction angiography we may have a different end-point of sedation compared to our original study, as well as a shorter angiogram time. Satisfactory anaesthetist-administered sedation can be provided for cerebral angiography by either infusion or incremental techniques. We feel that the success and safety of a sedation technique depends considerably on the skill and experience of the administrator such that these sedation techniques are only suitable for safe use by an anaesthetist.", 
    "188": "We did a follow-up study based upon a regional prescription register in Denmark. We identified all 435 women who in the period 1991-1996 had redeemed a prescription for CNS drugs during pregnancy. Among the rest of the pregnant women we randomly selected 1304 women who also had given birth to a child in the same region and period. We looked up the local health nurses Boel test results which were available for about 80%. Any abnormal test result was seen much more frequently among exposed (16%) than for not exposed (4%). The study has several limitations but raises concern that should be addressed in other and better designed studies.", 
    "189": "A chiral amino acid-based monomeric and polymeric surfactant, sodium oleyl-L-leucylvalinate) (L-SOLV) and poly(sodium oleyl-L-leucylvalinate) (poly-L-SOLV) were synthesized and used for chiral separations in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Poly-L-SOLV was used successfully in the separation of various enantiomers of neutral, acidic, and basic analytes such as 1,1'-bi-2-napthol, 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diamine, benzoin, hydrobenzoin, benzoin methylether, warfarin, and coumachlor obtaining well-resolved peaks but with only partial separation of temazepam. In addition, the atropisomer 1,1'-binaphthyl-2, 2'-dihydrogen phosphate was chosen to study the applicability of the polymeric surfactant over a wide range of parameters such as concentration, temperature, voltage, and pH. The most striking characteristic of this new surfactant is its high hydrophobicity. It is favorable to interactions with hydrophobic chiral analytes, and thus may provide better chiral recognition for the compounds.", 
    "190": "Both first-generation and second-generation antipsychotic medications can lower the seizure threshold, increasing the chances of seizure induction. This article reviews the published literature concerning the seizure-lowering effects of first- and second-generation antipsychotic medication. Unfortunately, rigorously controlled studies are relatively infrequent, and case reports form a large part of the available literature, limiting the confidence with which firm conclusions can be drawn. Of the first-generation antipsychotic medications, chlorpromazine appears to be associated with the greatest risk of seizure provocation, although other first-generation antipsychotics also lower seizure threshold. Conversely, molindone, haloperidol, fluphenazine, pimozide and trifluoperazine are associated with a lower risk of seizure induction. Clozapine is the second-generation antipsychotic most frequently associated with seizures, with risperidone appearing to confer a relatively low risk. Other factors such as history of seizure activity, concurrent use of other drugs that lower seizure threshold, rapid dose titration, slow drug metabolism, metabolic factors and drug-drug interactions appear to increase the chances of an antipsychotic medication inducing seizure activity."
