PIMs were analyzed according to the Norwegian General Practice-Nursing Home criteria (NORGEP-NH), use of single substances to avoid, combinations to avoid, and deprescribing items. Associations between sample and use of PIMs were examined by logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, and ward. We established Pearsons r for correlations between numbers of drugs and PIMs.", 
    "2": "Altogether, 4373 patients (mean age 85.7\u2009years, 73.5% women) were included. The mean overall number of drugs per patient increased from 4.7 in 1997 to 6.9 in 2011 (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Use of any single substances to avoid increased from 36.8% in 1997 to 39.5% in 2011 (p\u2009=\u20090.002), use of any combinations to avoid from 16.3% to 27.0% (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and use of any deprescribing items from 46.0% to 55.3% (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Use of codeine-analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, long-acting benzodiazepines, and first generation antihistamines decreased significantly, while use of short-acting benzodiazepines, z-hypnotics, statins, and anti-dementia drugs increased significantly. A moderate strong correlation was detected between number of drugs and the three above-mentioned PIM categories, r\u2009=\u20090.34, r\u2009=\u20090.43, r\u2009=\u20090.37, respectively (all p\u2009<\u20090.001).",

HZ-166 (2) has been shown to have anxiolytic-like effects with reduced sedative/ataxic liabilities. A 1,3-oxazole KRM-II-81 (9) was discovered from a series of six bioisosteres with significantly improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties as compared to 2. Oxazole 9 was further characterized and exhibited improved anxiolytic-like effects in a mouse marble burying assay and a rat Vogel conflict test.", 
    "5": "Despite the availability of numerous antiepileptic drugs, 20-30% of epileptic patients are pharmacoresistant with seizures not appropriately controlled. Consequently, new strategies to address this unmet medical need are required. T-type calcium channels play a key role in neuronal excitability and burst firing, and selective triple T-type calcium channel blockers could offer a new way to treat various CNS disorders, in particular epilepsy. Herein we describe the identification of new 1,4-benzodiazepines as brain penetrant and selective triple T-type calcium channel blockers. From racemic hit 4, optimization work led to the preparation of pyridodiazepine 31c with improved physicochemical properties, solubility, and metabolic stability. The racemic mixture was separated by chiral preparative HPLC, and the resulting lead compound (3R,5S)-31c showed promising efficacy in the WAG/Rij-rat model of generalized nonconvulsive absence-like epilepsy.",

In addition to the usual, comprehensive support provided at our clinic, we gave the SleepMapper to 30 patients initiating positive airway pressure. They were compared with patients initiating positive airway pressure at our clinic without SleepMapper (controls) to determine whether SleepMapper affected adherence. A total of 61 patients had polysomnographic and adherence data analysed, 30 were given SleepMapper and 31 received our standard of care. The two groups were well matched at baseline to include no significant differences in age, apnea-hypopnea index, percentage receiving split-night polysomnographs and starting pressures. Patients in the control group received significantly more non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics the night of their polysomnography and during positive airway pressure initiation. At 11\u00a0weeks, patients in the SleepMapper group had a greater percentage of nights with any use (78.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.0 versus 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.0%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and >4\u00a0h positive airway pressure use (78.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.0 versus 55.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.0%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). There was a trend toward more patients in the SleepMapper group achieving >4\u00a0h of use for at least 70% of nights [9/30 (30%) versus 3/31 (9.7%); P\u00a0=\u00a00.06]. In multivariate linear regression, the SleepMapper remained significantly associated with percentage of nights >4\u00a0h positive airway pressure use (\u03b2 coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.18; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Added to our usual, comprehensive programme to maximize positive airway pressure adherence in new users, the SleepMapper was independently associated with an 18% increase in nights >4\u00a0h of use.",

Dose-limiting toxic effects of rovalpituzumab tesirine occurred at a dose of 0\u00b78 mg/kg every 3 weeks, including grade 4 thrombocytopenia (in two of two patients at that dose level) and grade 4 liver function test abnormalities (in one patient). The most frequent grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events in 74 patients with small-cell lung cancer were thrombocytopenia (eight [11%]), pleural effusion (six [8%]), and increased lipase (five [7%]). Drug-related serious adverse events occurred in 28 (38%) of 74 patients. The maximum tolerated dose of rovalpituzumab tesirine was 0\u00b74 mg/kg every 3 weeks; the recommended phase 2 dose and schedule is 0\u00b73 mg/kg every 6 weeks.

These concerns are amplified for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), whose patients may receive care concurrently from multiple prescribers within and outside VA. To illustrate the extent of this challenge, we examined overlapping prescriptions for buprenorphine, opioids, and benzodiazepines among veterans dually enrolled in VA and Medicare Part D.", 
    "20": "We constructed a cohort of all veterans dually enrolled in VA and Part D who filled an opioid prescription in 2012. We identified patients who received tablet or film buprenorphine products from either source.

However, the exact effects of TSPO ligands on Th1 responses in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo are still unclear. In the present study, we found that TSPO ligands, FGIN1-27 and Ro5-4864, suppressed the cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner by purified human CD4(+) T-cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after stimulation. TSPO ligands inhibited the production of interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) by memory CD4(+) T-cells and the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4(+) T-cells into Th1 cells via suppressing the activity of the corresponding transcription factors as indicated by reduced expression of T-bet and down-regulation of STAT1, STAT4 and STAT5 phosphorylation. TSPO ligands suppressed cell proliferation and activation of CD4(+) T-cells by the inhibition of TCR signal transduction including membrane proteins: Zap, Lck, Src; cytoplasm proteins: Plc\u03b31, Slp-76, ERK, JNK and the nucleoproteins: c-Jun and c-Fos. In addition, FGIN1-27 inhibited mixed lymphocyte reactions by human or murine cells. After the transplantation of allogeneic murine skin, injection of FGIN1-27 into mice prevented graft rejection by inhibition of cell infiltration and IFN-\u03b3 production. Taken together, our data suggest that TSPO ligands inhibit Th1 cell responses and might be novel therapeutic medicine for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and prevention of transplant rejection.",

During this period, 2.7% (95% CI: 2.5-2.8%) of ED encounters prescribed an opioid were also prescribed a benzodiazepine. Relative to encounters receiving an opioid prescription alone, encounters receiving a co-prescription were more likely to represent a follow-up rather than initial visit (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.52), receive more medications (OR 1.41) and fewer procedures (OR 0.48) while in the ED, and more likely to have a diagnosis related to mental disorder (OR 20.60) or musculoskeletal problem (OR 3.71).",

Univariate and multivariate analyzes were applied to identify predictive risk factors for oxygen desaturation. Prediction probability was used to test the association between potential risk factors (obesity, age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, and benzodiazepines use) and the combination of sOSA and oxygen desaturation.

The same analyses applied to patients with sOSA identified two independent risk factors for oxygen desaturation: obesity (P<0.001), and benzodiazepine use (P=0.017). Obesity obtains the best prediction probability [95% CI] for the combination of sOSA and oxygen desaturation: 0.74 [0.69-0.79].

The Neurocart was used between repeated fear-potentiated startle assessments. Thus, the potential influence of anxiety on CNS pharmacodynamic markers could be examined.", 
    "38": "Compared to placebo, VAScalmness increased with alprazolam (2.0\u00a0mm) and pregabalin (2.5\u00a0mm) but not with diphenhydramine. Saccadic peak velocity (SPV) declined after alprazolam (-57\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0s(-1) ) and pregabalin (-28\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0s(-1) ), more than with diphenhydramine (-14\u00a0\u00b0\u00a0s(-1) ); so did smooth pursuit. The average responses of SPV and smooth pursuit were significantly correlated with the drug-induced increases in VAScalmness . The SPV-relative responses of VASalertness , body-sway and adaptive-tracking also differed among alprazolam, pregabalin and diphenhydramine.", 
    "39": "Compared with the antihistaminergic sedative diphenhydramine, alprazolam and pregabalin caused larger SPV reduction, which was correlated with simultaneous improvement of subjective calmness, during a study day in which anxiety was stimulated repeatedly. The different effect profiles of the three drugs are in line with their pharmacological distinctions. These findings corroborate the profiling of CNS effects to demonstrate pharmacological selectivity, and further support SPV as biomarker for anxiolysis involving GABA-ergic neurons. The study also supports the use of prolonged mild threat to demonstrate anxiolytic effects in healthy volunteers.",

Here we investigated the anticancer potential and effects of low-molecular-weight bridgehead oxygen and nitrogen-containing spiro-bisheterocycles on proliferation and apoptosis of the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The compounds feature a hydantoin moiety attached to either diazole, isoxazole, diazepine, oxazepine or benzodiazepine via the privileged tetrahedral spiro-linkage. Treatment with compounds spiro [hydantoin-isoxazole] and spiro [hydantoin-oxazepine] resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in both breast cancer cell lines, whereas spiro [hydantoin-diazepine] was only active against MDA-MB 231. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed up-regulation of murine double minute 2 (MDM2), strictly p53-dependent, and detected an increase in expression of pro-apoptotic caspase 3 and BCL2-associated X (BAX) genes in both breast cancer cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant p53.

To improve properties of this compound as an asthma therapeutic, a series of analogs with a deuterated methoxy group in place of methoxy group at C-8 position was evaluated for isotope effects in preclinical assays; including microsomal stability, cytotoxicity, and sensorimotor impairment. The deuterated compounds were equally or more metabolically stable than the corresponding non-deuterated analogs and increased sensorimotor impairment was observed for some deuterated compounds. Thioesters were more cytotoxic in comparison to other carboxylic acid derivatives of this compound series. The most promising compound 16 identified from the in\u00a0vitro screens also strongly inhibited smooth muscle constriction in ex\u00a0vivo guinea pig tracheal rings. Smooth muscle relaxation, determined by reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness with a murine ovalbumin sensitized and challenged model, showed that 16 was efficacious at low methacholine concentrations. However, this effect was limited due to suboptimal pharmacokinetics of 16. Based on these findings, further analogs of XHE-III-74 will be investigated to improve in\u00a0vivo metabolic stability while retaining the efficacy at lung tissues involved in asthma pathology.",

OLZ FI and physical mixtures (3:1 and 1:1, as powders or compacts) of olanzapine with polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K25) and hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC-LF) were stored (75%RH/25\u00b0C, 75%RH/40\u00b0C and 93%RH/25\u00b0C) for 28days. OLZ FI and the physical mixtures were also suspended in water under stirring (200rpm/60min). Samples were collected at different time points and vacuum filtered. OLZ FI showed to hydrate at 75%RH/25\u00b0C when stored in the presence of HPC and PEG. At 93%RH all polymers affected the kinetics of hydration of OLZ FI with PVP as the only polymer with the ability to minimize the formation of the hydrate. When olanzapine was suspended in water with HPC and PVP the formation of the hydrate was inhibited. Compaction of the powders before storage led to an increase of the hydrate conversion rate of olanzapine on the first week of storage, due to a partial amorphisation of olanzapine present at the tablet surface. When stored at high humidity environments OLZ FI converted into dihydrate D and, when exposed to aqueous environments in the presence of different polymers converted into dihydrates B and E. From an industrial point of view, this study highlighted the importance of the excipient's choice for OLZ formulations, so that a final OLZ medicine can have a consistent quality and performance throughout the entire medicine's shelf life.",

In this study the objectives were to determine the prevalence of potentially inappropriate medication prescribing (PIM) in primary care using STOPP versions 1 (v1) and 2 (v2), as well as 2012 AGS Beers criteria, and analyze the factors associated with inappropriate prescribing according to STOPP/START v2. A cross-sectional study was carried out including community-dwelling older adults over the age of 65. Sociodemographic, clinical, functional and comprehensive drug therapy data were collected. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients receiving at least one PIM. This variable was measured using three tools: STOPP v1, 2012 AGS Beers criteria and STOPP v2. Similarly, the percentage of patients receiving at least one potential prescribing omission (PPO) was calculated using START versions 1 and 2. A total of 1,615 prescriptions were reviewed. The median number of medications per patient was 7.1 drugs (\u00b13.8). The prevalence of elderly people exposed to polypharmacy (\u22655 medications) was 72.9%, whereas 28.4% of the participants took \u226510 drugs regularly. PIM were present in 18.7%, 37.3% and 40.4% of participants, according to the STOPP v1, 2012 Beers criteria and STOPP v2, respectively. According to STOPP v2, the number of medications taken (OR: 1.14, 1.06-1.25), the presence of a psychological disorder (OR: 2.22, 1.13-4.37) and insomnia (OR: 3.35, 1.80-6.32) were risk factors for taking a PIM. The prevalence of PPOs was 34.7% and 21.8% according to version 1 and 2, respectively. In conclusion, STOPP-START criteria have been remarkably modified, which is evidenced by the different prevalence rates detected using version 2, as compared to version 1. In fact, the level of agreement between version 1 and the updated version is only moderate. Special attention should be paid on benzodiazepines, which keep being the most frequent PIM.",

    "69": "In the treatment of dyslipidemias about 5-6 years back a new class of drugs emerged, CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein)-inhibitors. Their benefit was due to an increase of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) serum levels. This treatment mode was supported by epidemiological and clinical studies, as people with high serum HDL-C levels suffered less from cardiovascular (CV) events. Three studies with CETP inhibitors (ILLUMINATE with torcetrapib, dal-OUTCOMES with dalcetrapib and ACCELERATE with evacetrapib) were unfortunately negative, and torcetrapib was even harmful to patients due to an increase of aldosterone serum levels. Treatment with dalcetrapib was safe, but without benefit. Similar it was with evacetrapib. There is still running also a study with anacetrapib (REVEAL), but a benefit is here not expected. Evacetrapib and anacetrapib in comparison to dalcetrapib can reduce serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) much more, and similar results were found also in another CETP-inhibitor TA-8995 (TULIP study). Authors try to explain why there is no benefit with CETP-inhibitors (dysfunctional HDL particle, another effective mechanism than reverse cholesterol transport). A genetic analysis in dalcetrapib studies (dal-OUTCOMES and dal-PLAQUE-2) showed, that a cardiovascular benefit from this treatment is concentrated only to a subgroup of patients with a genotype AA in the gene ADCY9 on 16th chromosome. In the population there are about 20% of people with this AA genotype. A clinical study DAL-301 will test this data in a near future. Framingham Offspring study showed that the association of\" HDL-C serum level - CV risk in the future\" is greatly influenced by serum levels of LDL-C and triglycerides (if these are increased, than the CV future prediction with HDL-C levels is lost). HDL particles are complex and we do not know which subtype of HDL particles is for cardiovascular prognosis important.

The goals of sedation in ARDS patients are to improve patient comfort and tolerance of supportive and therapeutic measures without contributing to adverse outcomes. This review discusses the current evidence for sedation management in patients with ARDS.", 
    "71": "Deep sedation strategies should be avoided in the care of patients with ARDS because deep sedation has been associated with increased time on mechanical ventilation, longer ICU and hospital length of stay, and higher mortality in critically ill patients. Adoption of protocol-based, light-sedation strategies is preferred and improves patient outcomes. Although the optimal sedative agent for ARDS patients is unclear, benzodiazepines should be avoided because of associations with oversedation, delirium, prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay, and increased mortality. Minimizing sedation in patients with ARDS facilitates early mobilization and early discharge from the ICU, potentially aiding in recovery from critical illness. Strategies to optimize ventilation in ARDS patients, such as low tidal volume ventilation and high positive end-expiratory pressure can be employed without deep sedation; however, deep sedation is required if patients receive neuromuscular blockade, which may benefit some ARDS patients. Knowledge gaps persist as to whether or not prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be tolerated with light sedation.",

    "73": "A deeper understanding of post-stroke plasticity is critical to devise more effective pharmacological and rehabilitative treatments. The GABAergic system is one of the key modulators of neuronal plasticity, and plays an important role in the control of \"critical periods\" during brain development. Here, we report a key role for GABAergic inhibition in functional restoration following ischemia in the adult mouse forelimb motor cortex. After stroke, the majority of cortical sites in peri-infarct areas evoked simultaneous movements of forelimb, hindlimb and tail, consistent with a loss of inhibitory signalling. Accordingly, we found a delayed decrease in several GABAergic markers that accompanied cortical reorganization. To test whether reductions in GABAergic signalling were causally involved in motor improvements, we treated animals during an early post-stroke period with a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, which impairs GABAA receptor function. We found that hampering GABAA signalling led to significant restoration of function in general motor tests (i.e., gridwalk and pellet reaching tasks), with no significant impact on the kinematics of reaching movements. Improvements were persistent as they remained detectable about three weeks after treatment. These data demonstrate a key role for GABAergic inhibition in limiting motor improvements after cortical stroke.",

    "83": "Virtually every neuron within the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) communicates via GABAergic signaling. The extracellular levels of GABA within the SCN are determined by a complex interaction of synthesis and transport, as well as synaptic and non-synaptic release. The response to GABA is mediated by GABAA receptors that respond to both phasic and tonic GABA release and that can produce excitatory as well as inhibitory cellular responses. GABA also influences circadian control through the exclusively inhibitory effects of GABAB receptors. Both GABA and neuropeptide signaling occur within the SCN, although the functional consequences of the interactions of these signals are not well understood. This review considers the role of GABA in the circadian pacemaker, in the mechanisms responsible for the generation of circadian rhythms, in the ability of non-photic stimuli to reset the phase of the pacemaker, and in the ability of the day-night cycle to entrain the pacemaker.",

The trend of red shifts caused by the substitutions had full compliance with the trend of decreasing the calculated band gap (\u0394ELUMO-HOMO) by semi-empirical AM1 and DFT/B3LYP/6-311+G* computational methods. The positive solvatochromism of BZD a demonstrated the \u03c0-\u03c0* nature of the singlet excited state. Dual fluorescence was observed in the emission spectra of BZD f and g, while their spectrum in different concentration showed only one peak short wavelength (SW) in dilute solutions. The main peak in SW around 370nm was attributed to the monomer of BZD (f* or g*) and the broader emission shifted to the visible region around 400nm in middle wavelength (MW) to the intermolecular excimer emission of BZD ([f/f]*or [g/g]*). The observed phenomena, such as solvatochromism, dual fluorescence, some red shifts caused by substitution, and larger Stokes shift indicated the existence of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) in the BZDs series.

    "91": "Childhood burns are a profoundly traumatic and painful experience. Despite recognition of the prevalence of burn injuries in children and the severity of the associated pain, burn pain remains undertreated. At the same time, more evidence is emerging to suggest that undertreated pain has serious long-term medical and psychiatric consequences, many of which can be ameliorated with improved pain control. Pain in burn patients is, however, notoriously difficult to treat, perhaps because there is a chronic pain aspect underlying the acute pain that accompanies wound care and procedures. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that there are little data to guide decision making in these patients. This article aims to identify the best strategies to guide clinical practice through a review of the past 10 years' development in pediatric burn pain management. However, because clinical investigations remain limited in burned children, we also aim to draw attention to those areas where the data do not identify an optimal approach and further work is needed. Overall, in addition to just the traditional pharmacological approaches to pain, such as acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, and opioids, there is growing evidence to support more widespread use of regional anesthesia and novel technologies such as virtual reality. Starting with an improved understanding of the current state of the literature, we can identify areas of research and important questions whose answers will ultimately improve care and reduce suffering for this unfortunate population of children.", 
    "92": "Status epilepticus requires treatment with emergent initial therapy with a benzodiazepine and urgent control therapy with an additional antiepileptic drug (AED) to terminate clinical and/or electrographic seizure activity. However, nearly one-third of patients will prove refractory to the aforementioned therapies and are prone to a higher degree of neuronal injury, resistance to pharmacotherapy, and death. Current guidelines for refractory status epilepticus (RSE) recommend initiating a continuous intravenous (CIV) anesthetic over bolus dosing with a different AED. Continuous intravenous agents most commonly used for this indication include midazolam, propofol, and pentobarbital, but ketamine is an alternative option. Comparative studies illustrating the optimal agent are lacking, and selection is often based on adverse effect profiles and patient-specific factors. In addition, dosing and titration are largely based on small studies and expert opinion with continuous electroencephalogram monitoring used to guide intensity and duration of treatment. Nonetheless, the doses required to halt seizure activity are likely to produce profound adverse effects that clinicians should anticipate and combat. The purpose of this review was to summarize the available RSE literature focusing on CIV midazolam, pentobarbital, propofol, and ketamine, and to serve as a primer for nurses providing care to these patients.",

For the acute treatment intravenous benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam, clonazepam) and intramuscular midazolam appear as most effective treatments for early SE. In children, buccal or intranasal midazolam are useful alternatives. In established SE intravenous antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin, valproate, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, and lacosamide) are in use.

Three G-A alkylating dimers have been reported in publications to date, with defined DNA-binding sites proposed for two of them. In this study we have used molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate preferred DNA-binding sites for the three published molecular types.

However, for the PBD-CI molecule ('Compound 11', 3), we were unable to reconcile the results of our simulations with the reported preferred cross-linking sequence (5'-ATTTTCC(G)-3'). We found that the molecule is too short to span the five base pairs between the A and G bases as claimed, but should target instead a sequence such as 5'-ATTTC(G)-3' with two less base pairs between the reacting G and A residues. Our simulation results for this hybrid dimer are also in accord with the very low interstrand cross-linking and in vitro cytotoxicity activities reported for it. Although a preferred cross-linking sequence was not reported for the third hybrid dimer ('27eS', 2), our simulations predict that it should span two base pairs between covalently reacting G and A bases (e.g., 5'-GTAT(A)-3').",

We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created 'Summary of findings' tables using GRADE.", 
    "150": "We found two new randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the 2015 update searching. The review now includes six studies, randomising 1367 participants and presenting data relevant to six comparisons.When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with haloperidol alone for psychosis-induced aggression for the outcome not tranquil or asleep at 30 minutes, the combination treatment was clearly more effective (n=316, 1 RCT, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.87, high-quality evidence). There were 10 occurrences of acute dystonia in the haloperidol alone arm and none in the combination group. The trial was stopped early as haloperidol alone was considered to be too toxic.When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with olanzapine, high-quality data showed both approaches to be tranquillising. It was suggested that the combination of haloperidol plus promethazine was more effective, but the difference between the two approaches did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n=300, 1 RCT, RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.61, high-quality evidence). Lower-quality data suggested that the risk of unwanted excessive sedation was less with the combination approach (n=116, 2 RCTs, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.12 to 3.84).When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with ziprasidone all data were of lesser quality. We identified no binary data for the outcome tranquil or asleep. The average sedation score (Ramsay Sedation Scale) was lower for the combination approach but not to conventional levels of statistical significance (n=60, 1 RCT, MD -0.1, 95% CI - 0.58 to 0.38). These data were of low quality and it is unclear what they mean in clinical terms. The haloperidol plus promethazine combination appeared to cause less excessive sedation but again the difference did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n=111, 2 RCTs, RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.43).We found few data for the comparison of haloperidol plus promethazine versus haloperidol plus midazolam. Average Ramsay Sedation Scale scores suggest the combination of haloperidol plus midazolam to be the most sedating (n=60, 1 RCT, MD - 0.6, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.07, low-quality evidence). The risk of excessive sedation was considerably less with haloperidol plus promethazine (n=117, 2 RCTs, RR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.49, low-quality evidence). Haloperidol plus promethazine seemed to decrease the risk of needing restraints by around 12 hours (n=60, 1 RCT, RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.55, low-quality evidence). It may be that use of midazolam with haloperidol sedates swiftly, but this effect does not last long.When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with lorazepam, haloperidol plus promethazine seemed to more effectively cause sedation or tranquillisation by 30 minutes (n=200, 1 RCT, RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.68, high-quality evidence). The secondary outcome of needing restraints or seclusion by 12 hours was not clearly different between groups, with about 10% in each group needing this intrusive intervention (moderate-quality evidence). Sedation data were not reported, however, the combination group did have less 'any serious adverse event' in 24-hour follow-up, but there were not clear differences between the groups and we are unsure exactly what the adverse effect was. There were no deaths.When haloperidol plus promethazine was compared with midazolam, there was clear evidence that midazolam is more swiftly tranquillising of an aggressive situation than haloperidol plus promethazine (n=301, 1 RCT, RR 2.90, 95% CI 1.75 to 4.8, high-quality evidence). On its own, midazolam seems to be swift and effective in tranquillising people who are aggressive due to psychosis. There was no difference in risk of serious adverse event overall (n=301, 1 RCT, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.95, high-quality evidence). However, 1 in 150 participants allocated haloperidol plus promethazine had a swiftly reversed seizure, and 1 in 151 given midazolam had swiftly reversed respiratory arrest.", 
    "151": "Haloperidol plus promethazine is effective and safe, and its use is based on good evidence. Benzodiazepines work, with midazolam being particularly swift, but both midazolam and lorazepam cause respiratory depression. Olanzapine intramuscular and ziprasidone intramuscular do seem to be viable options and their action is swift, but resumption of aggression with subsequent need to re-inject was more likely than with haloperidol plus promethazine. Haloperidol used on its own without something to offset its frequent and serious adverse effects does seem difficult to justify.",

Levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), phosphorylated-TH (p-TH), dopamine active transporter (DAT), and D\u2081 and D\u2082 receptors were measured via Western blot and/or receptor autoradiography. Aripiprazole decreased TH and D\u2081 receptor levels in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and p-TH levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of females, whilst TH levels decreased in the PFC of males. Olanzapine decreased PFC p-TH levels and increased D\u2082 receptor expression in the PFC and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in females only. Additionally, risperidone treatment increased D\u2081 receptor levels in the hippocampus of females, whilst, in males, p-TH levels increased in the PFC and hippocampus, D\u2081 receptor expression decreased in the NAc, and DAT levels decreased in the caudate putamen (CPu), and elevated in the VTA.

In such cases, pharmacological and other treatment options are available. Options for causal therapy should be checked and performed if adequate. Opioids are used to relieve pain and dyspnea. In a\u00a0state of delirium, highly potent neuroleptics and atypical antipsychotics are used. For the treatment of anxiety or restlessness benzodiazepines can be prescribed. Sedative medication may reduce stress, for instance in the case of acute catastrophic bleeding. Palliative sedation is an ultima ratio concept for refractory symptoms at the end of life.

    "185": "Purpose: Some studies have suggested that the use of benzodiazepines in the elderly is associated with an increased risk of dementia. However, this association might be due to confounding by indication and reverse causation. To examine the association between benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug use and the risk of dementia, we conducted data mining of a spontaneous reporting database and a large organized database of prescriptions. Methods: Data from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from the first quarter of 2004 through the end of 2013 and data from the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database from the first quarter of 1965 through the end of 2013 were used for the analyses. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were calculated. In addition, prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA) was performed to identify the risk of dementia after using benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs over the period of January 2006 to May 2014. Results: Benzodiazepine use was found to be associated with dementia in analyses using the FAERS database (ROR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.61-1.64; IC: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.65-0.67) and the Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database (ROR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.83-1.94; IC: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.80-0.89). ROR and IC values increased with the duration of action of benzodiazepines. In the PSSA, a significant association was found, with adjusted sequence ratios of 1.24 (1.05-1.45), 1.20 (1.06-1.37), 1.23 (1.11-1.37), 1.34 (1.23-1.47), 1.41 (1.29-1.53), and 1.44 (1.33-1.56) at intervals of 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively. Furthermore, the additional PSSA, in which patients who initiated a new treatment with benzodiazepines and anti-dementia drugs within 12- and 24-month periods were excluded from the analysis, demonstrated significant associations of benzodiazepine use with dementia risk. Conclusion: Multi-methodological approaches using different methods, algorithms, and databases suggest that long-term use of benzodiazepines and long-acting benzodiazepines are strongly associated with an increased risk of dementia.",

A previously optimized method of hot high pressure homogenization (HPH) was adopted for the production of the LN, which comprised solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and nanoemulsions (NE). Precirol(\u200a\u00ae) was selected as the solid lipid for progression of studies. SLN exhibited the best performance for transdermal delivery of olanzapine, based on in vitro release and permeation studies, coupled with results from physicochemical characterization of several solid:liquid lipid formulations. Stability tests, performed to give an indication of long-term storage behavior of the formulations, were in good agreement with previous studies for the best choice of solid:liquid lipid ratio.

    "188": "Antipsychotic medication is an essential component for treating schizophrenia, which is a serious mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the global population. Olanzapine (Olz), one of the most frequently prescribed atypical antipsychotics, is generally considered a first-line drug for treating schizophrenia. In contrast to psychotic symptoms, the effects of Olz on cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia are still unclear. In addition, the mechanisms by which Olz affects the neural circuits associated with cognitive function are unknown. Here we show that Olz interrupts depotentiation (reversal of long-term potentiation) without disturbing de novo LTP (long-term potentiation) and LTD (long-term depression). At hippocampal SC-CA1 synapses, inhibition of NMDARs (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors), mGluRs (metabotropic glutamate receptors), or mAChRs (muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) disrupted depotentiation. In addition, co-activation of NMDARs, mGluRs, and mAChRs reversed stably expressed LTP. Olz inhibits the activation of mAChRs, which amplifies glutamate signaling through enhanced NMDAR opening and Gq (Gq class of G protein)-mediated signal transduction. Behaviorally, Olz impairs spatial reversal learning of mice in the Morris water maze test. Our results uncover a novel mechanism underpinning the cognitive modulation of Olz and show that the anticholinergic property of Olz affects glutamate signaling and synaptic plasticity.",

Mice were administered 0.5 or 1.0mg flubromazolam/kg body weight intraperitoneally, urine was collected for 24h. All samples, together with six authentic forensic human case specimens, were analyzed (with or without hydrolysis, in case it was urine) by UHPLC-HRMS on an Acquity HSS T3 column with an Agilent 6550 QTOF.

Besides O-glucuronidation, flubromazolam formed an N(+)-glucuronide. Flubromazolam was not metabolized extensively in vitro, as only two monohydroxy metabolites were detected in low intensity in hepatocytes. In the mice samples, seven metabolites were identified, which mostly matched the metabolites in the human samples. However, less flubromazolam N(+)-glucuronide and an additional hydroxy metabolite were observed. The six human urine specimens showed different extent of metabolism: some samples had an intense flubromazolam peak next to a minute signal for a monohydroxy metabolite, others showed the whole variety of hydroxylated and glucuronidated metabolites. Overall, the most abundant metabolite was a monohydroxy metabolite, which we propose as \u03b1-hydroxyflubromazolam based on MSMS fragmentation.

A benefit was found for electromagnetic radiation (one RCT, 58 participants), however findings were inconclusive for antidepressants, benzodiazepines, dietary supplements and physical barriers.Secondary outcomes (change in taste and feeling of dryness) were only assessed short-term, and the findings for both were also inconclusive.With regard to adverse effects, there is very low-quality evidence that antidepressants increase dizziness and drowsiness (one RCT, 37 participants), and that alpha lipoic acid increased headache (two RCTs, 118 participants) and gastrointestinal complaints (3 RCTs, 138 participants). We found insufficient/contradictory evidence regarding adverse events for anticonvulsants or benzodiazepines. Adverse events were poorly reported or unreported for cholinergics, electromagnetic radiation, and psychological therapies. No adverse events occurred from physical barriers or topical therapy use.",

The utilization of atypical antipsychotics increased by 60% (from 3.68 to 5.89 DDD/TID), while the utilization of typical antipsychotics decreased by 76% (from 10.49 to 2.53 DDD/TID). The drugs showing the largest increase were olanzapine (from 1.21 to 2.78 DDD/TID) and quetiapine (from 0 to 0.68 DDD/TID). The typical/atypical antipsychotic ratio changed from 1:0.4 in 2001 to 1:2.3 in 2010. A 2.3-fold decrease was recorded in the utilization of anticholinergics (from 2.05 to 0.91 DDD/TID).",

Study results pointed to two favorable features, i.e. low use of typical antipsychotics and the ratio of typical and atypical antipsychotics. Implementation of the new clinical guidelines for nervous system disorders and updating of the list of reimbursable drugs with the addition of new ones contributed to the observed improvement in the prescribing patterns during the study period. Using the WHO ATC/DDD methodology and rationality indicators in the assessment of trends in the outpatient utilization of psychopharmaceuticals over a ten-year period proved efficient in the evaluation of prescribing rationality.",

Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the evidence was at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting, some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties, and a high risk of selective reporting in one trial that contributed very few participants. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.We found no evidence that melatonin, at doses up to 10 mg, improved any major sleep outcome over 8 to 10 weeks in patients with AD who were identified as having a sleep disturbance. We were able to synthesize data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (mean difference (MD) 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; N = 184; two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; N = 184; two studies). From single studies, we found no difference between melatonin and placebo groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, or number of night-time awakenings. From two studies, we found no effect of melatonin on cognition or performance of activities of daily living (ADL). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies. We considered this evidence to be of low quality.There was low-quality evidence that trazodone 50 mg given at night for two weeks improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; N = 30; one study), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; N = 30; one study) in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, but it did not affect the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; N = 30; one study), or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; N = 30; one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, cognition, or ADL. No serious adverse effects of trazodone were reported.Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Because the data were from a single, small study and reporting was incomplete, we considered this evidence to be of low quality in general terms. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural, or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects from ramelteon.", 
    "225": "We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no RCTs of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in dementia, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin (up to 10mg) helped sleep problems in patients with moderate to severe dementia due to AD. There was some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to AD. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in dementia. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.", 
    "226": "Treatments for physical dependence and associated withdrawal symptoms following the abrupt discontinuation of prescription drugs (such as opioids and benzodiazepines), nicotine, alcohol, and cannabinoids are available, but there is still a need for new and more effective therapies. This review examines evidence supporting the potential use of pregabalin, an \u03b12\u03b4 voltage-gated calcium channel subunit ligand, for the treatment of physical dependence and associated withdrawal symptoms. A literature search of the MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases up to and including 11\u00a0December 2015 was conducted. The search term used was '(dependence OR withdrawal) AND pregabalin'. No other date limits were set and no language restrictions were applied. Works cited in identified articles were cross-referenced and personal archives of references also searched. Articles were included based on the expert opinions of the authors. There is limited evidence supporting the role of pregabalin for the treatment of physical dependence and accompanying withdrawal symptoms associated with opioids, benzodiazepines, nicotine, cannabinoids, and alcohol, although data from randomized controlled studies are sparse. However, the current evidence is promising and provides a platform for future studies, including appropriate randomized, placebo- and/or comparator-controlled studies, to further explore the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for the treatment of withdrawal symptoms. Given the potential for pregabalin misuse or abuse, particularly in individuals with a previous history of substance abuse, clinicians should exercise caution when using pregabalin in this patient population.",

Working memory improved with increasing doses of melatonin (compared to controls and diazepam); in comparison to setraline however, working memory decreased. A dose-related anxiolytic effect is seen when melatonin is compared to non-stressed and stressed controls. Melatonin administration reduced the systemic/oxidant response to repeated stress. Administration of melatonin in repeatedly stressed adolescent mice was associated with improved central excitation, enhancement of working memory, anxiolysis and reduced systemic response to stress.",

Consistently, the co-treatment downregulated protein levels of SREBP1, SREBP2, and LDLR by 57.71% \u00b1 9.42%, 73.05% \u00b1 11.82%, and 59.46% \u00b1 9.91%, respectively. In addition, co-treatment reversed the phosphorylation level of AMP-activated protein kinase-\u03b1 (AMPK\u03b1), which was reduced by OLZ, determined via the ratio of pAMPK\u03b1:AMPK\u03b1 (94.1%) compared with OLZ alone. The results showed that BBR may prevent lipid metabolism disorders caused by OLZ by reversing the degree of SREBP pathway upregulated and the phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b1 downregulated. Collectively, these results indicated that BBR could be used as a potential adjuvant to prevent dyslipidemia and obesity caused by the use of second-generation antipsychotic medication.",

    "271": "Female investigator conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study on female patients visiting the psychiatry outpatient department. Patients meeting inclusion criteria were assessed for SD disorder as per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4(th) Edition Text Revision. SD severity was measured using Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) scale.", 
    "272": "The prevalence of SD in this study was 68.32%. There was more than one SD in 48 (47.52%). FSFI score was significantly low in patients with SD as compared to patients not having SD (P = 0.001). SD was more common in patients who were on combination of antidepressants and benzodiazepines than antidepressant alone or antipsychotic alone.", 
    "273": "SD was prevalent in more than 50% of female patients on psychotropic drugs. Number of patients on individual psychotropic drugs was so small that a definite conclusion could not be drawn. Study emphasizes the need to carry out similar study on larger number of patients to get better insight into this problem.", 
    "274": "Upper endoscopy is a common procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of upper digestive tract diseases. The increasing number of pediatric gastrointestinal procedures has led to increasing attention on the safety and efficacy of medications used for sedation during the procedure. This randomized blinded interventional study was designed to compare the effect of oral midazolam with intravenous (IV) midazolam as a sedative medication in 119 children undergoing endoscopy. The mean time to sedation was 2.2\u00b10.7 in IV midazolam group and 30.9\u00b10 in oral midazolam group which was statistically significant difference between two groups. Separation from parents in oral midazolam group was as follow: 2 patients were high resistant (3.5%), 2 patients were resisted first and then relaxed (3.5%) and 55 patients were separated from their parents without any resistance (93%); whereas in IV midazolam group, 8 patients were high resistant (13.3%), 29 patients were relatively resistant (48.3%) and 23 patients were separated from their parents without any resistance (38.3%) that shows significant differences between the two groups. In terms of patient comfort during endoscopy, there was also a significant difference between the two groups. In oral midazolam, group parents were more consent, compared with the other group. The present study showed that oral midazolam is a safe and effective sedation during upper endoscopy in pediatrics. Oral midazolam reducing patients' anxiety during separation from parents leads the easy use of endoscopy and comfort of patients during endoscopy as compared with IV midazolam. Oral or IV midazolam were not able to put most patients in deep sedation level.",

Dantrolene, a selective ryanodine receptor antagonist, may be a potential drug for the prevention of seizure. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the protective effects of dantrolene against pentylenetetrazole seizure in mice. Male albino mice were received an intra-peritoneal injection of pentylenetetrazole (80 mg/kg) in seven separate groups (n=8). We used dantrolene (10,20 and 40 mg/kg), caffeine (200 mg/kg), dantrolene (40 mg/kg) + caffeine (200 mg/kg), diazepam (5 mg/kg as a positive control) and vehicle 30 minutes before the injection of pentylenetetrazole. Then, we registered the latency time of the first seizure, the severity of seizures and the incidence of seizure and death. Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the data. Dantrolene (10,20 and 40 mg/kg) significantly increased the latency time for the first seizure. Furthermore, dantrolene (20 and 40 mg/kg, but not 10 mg/kg) attenuated the severity of seizures in comparison to the vehicle group. Moreover, dantrolene only at the dose of 40 mg/kg prevented from tonic-clonic seizure and death in comparison to the vehicle group. In contrast, the addition of caffeine abolished the protective effects of dantrolene on the tonic-clonic seizure/death and inhibited the beneficial effects of dantrolene on the severity of pentylenetetrazol seizures. The acute dantrolene administration produced an anticonvulsant effect in the pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure. Moreover, caffeine prevented from dantrolene anticonvulsant effects. These results may imply about ryanodine receptors and intracellular calcium roles in the generation and control of pentylenetetrazole seizure.", 
    "276": "Persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) commonly present with chronic non-malignant pain, but long-term use of opioids among this population has not been studied previously. Our aim was to investigate the prevalence of long-term (\u2265180 days) use of opioids for non-malignant pain and associated factors among community-dwelling persons with AD and to compare the prevalence to a matched cohort without AD.Medication use and Alzheimer's disease (MEDALZ) cohort was utilized for this study, comprising all community-dwelling persons diagnosed with AD in Finland during 2005-2011 and their matched comparison persons without AD. After exclusion of persons with active cancer treatment, 62,074 persons with and 62,074 persons without AD were included in this study. Data were collected from nationwide registers.Opioids were used by 13,111 persons with and by 16,659 without AD. Overall long-term opioid use was more common among persons without AD (8.7%) compared to persons with AD (7.2%, p<0.0001). However, among opioid users, prevalence of long-term opioid use was slightly higher among persons with AD compared to those without AD (34.2% vs. 32.3%, respectively, p=0.0004). Long-term use of transdermal opioids was more than two-fold among opioid users with AD (13.2%) compared to users without AD (5.5%). Factors associated with long-term opioid use included AD, \u226580 years of age, female gender, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, low socioeconomic position, history of substance abuse and long-term benzodiazepine use.Prevalence of long-term opioid use was somewhat similar among both groups. Among persons with AD, long-term opioid use was strongly associated with transdermal opioids.",

Three themes emerged: \u00bb The need to improve recognition of substance misuse in patients receiving palliative care, and to meet the challenges palliative care teams face when caring for patients who have current or past opiate, benzodiazepine or alcohol addictions. \u00bb A lack of UK literature addressing the end of life care needs of patients with drug and alcohol addiction. There are articles in the US literature concerning a family-systems approach to the care of dying patients who have misused substances, and the role of social workers and counsellors in the care of dying patients receiving opiate-substitution treatment. \u00bb Inequitable access to end of life and palliative care services for homeless people, many of whom are addicted to substances or alcohol.", 
    "278": "Nerve agents (NAs) are extremely neurotoxic synthetic organophosphate (OP) compounds exploited as weapons of mass destruction in terrorist attacks and chemical warfare. Considering the current world scenario, there is a persistent threat of NA-exposure to military personals and civilians. Various prophylactic and post-exposure treatments (such as atropine and oximes) available currently for NA-poisoning are inadequate and unsatisfactory and suffer from severe limitations. Hence, developing safe and effective treatment(s) against NA-poisoning is a critical necessity. With regards to counteracting NA-toxicity, the OP-hydrolyzing enzymes (OPHEs), which can hydrolyze and inactivate a variety of NAs, have emerged as promising candidates for the development of prophylactic therapy against NA-poisoning. However, there are many hurdles to be crossed before these enzymes can be brought to therapeutic use in humans. In this article, we have reviewed the various advancements in the field of development of OPHEs as prophylactic against NA-poisoning. The article majorly focuses on the toxic effects of NAs, various available therapies to counteract NA poisoning, the current status of OPHEs and attempts made to improve the various properties of these enzymes. Further, we have also briefly discussed about the prospective work that is needed to be undertaken for developing these OPHEs into those suitable for use in humans.", 
    "279": "Background: Professional responsibilities are guided by laws and ethics that must be introduced and mastered within pharmaceutical sciences training. Instructional design to teaching typically introduces concepts in a traditional didactic approach and requires student memorization prior to application within practice settings. Additionally, many centers rely on best practices from abroad, due to lack of locally published laws and guidance documents. Objectives: The aim of this paper was to summarize and critically evaluate a professional skills laboratory designed to enhance learning through diversity in instructional methods relating to pharmacy law and best practices regarding narcotics, controlled medications, and benzodiazepines. Setting: This study took place within the Professional Skills Laboratory at the College of Pharmacy at Qatar University. Method: A total of 25 students participated in a redesigned laboratory session administered by a faculty member, clinical lecturer, teaching assistant, and a professional skills laboratory technician. The laboratory consisted of eight independent stations that students rotated during the 3-h session. Stations were highly interactive in nature and were designed using non-traditional approaches such as charades, role-plays, and reflective drawings. All stations attempted to have students relate learned concepts to practice within Qatar. Main outcome measures: Student perceptions of the laboratory were measured on a post-questionnaire and were summarized descriptively. Using reflection and consensus techniques, two faculty members completed a SWOC (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Challenges) analysis in preparation for future cycles. Results: 100% (25/25) of students somewhat or strongly agreed that their knowledge regarding laws and best practices increased and that their learning experience was enhanced by a mixed-methods approach. A total of 96% (24/25) of students stated that the mixed-methods instructional approach should be continued in the future. The SWOC analysis identified the mixed methods approach and student feedback as strengths and opportunities, while resource shortages and lack of impact assessment were identified as weaknesses and challenges. Conclusion: Creative redesign of instructional methods pertaining to law and best practices was effective to achieve positive student perceptions regarding instructional methods and learning. Future cycles should include rigorous assessment methods to evaluate impact on student learning and practice.", 
    "280": "Two rapidly acting antidepressive treatment forms, namely, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and ketamine, possibly share a common mechanism of action primarily involving alterations of neurotransmission (glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid levels). Because patients receiving ketamine and with a coexistent family history of an alcohol use disorder (AUD) seem to benefit from consistent and longer lasting antidepressive effects, we hypothesized better treatment response in ECT patients with an own history or a family history of an AUD.", 
    "281": "One hundred forty-one psychiatric inpatients with a major depressive episode, who were treated with ECT, were enrolled into this retrospective study. Age, sex, family or personal history of alcohol or benzodiazepine use disorder, ECT response data, and ECT treatment-related data were collected and analyzed with ordinal logistic regression and Fisher exact tests.", 
    "282": "Twenty-one percent of all patients had their own history of an AUD, 11% had their own history of a benzodiazepine use disorder, and 11% reported on a positive family history of alcohol or benzodiazepine use disorder. The logistic regression analyses revealed that only patient's own history of an AUD predicts a better ECT response (P = 0.031; odds ratio, 2.1; Fisher exact test, P = 0.006).", 
    "283": "Within the limitations of a retrospective study, a history of an AUD seems to be a positive predictor for an ECT response in patients experiencing a major depressive episode, which has not been found in 2 earlier studies. Findings are in line with neurobiological hypotheses of excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter changes with ketamine and ECT."
