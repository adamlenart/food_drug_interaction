    "0": "The rate of development of tolerance to the benzodiazepines clorazepate and clonazepam against pentetrazole-induced seizures in mice was compared. Treatment with clorazepate (0.1% solution as drinking water) for 21 days led to tolerance beginning at day 7. When mice were treated with clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg twice daily intraperitoneally), tolerance was evident already at the fourth day of treatment. Twenty-four hours after cessation of treatment the seizure threshold was significantly decreased after treatment with both drugs. Clorazepate, a prodrug of the main metabolite of diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, regards further interest for anticonvulsant therapy because of a relatively slow onset of tolerance.", 
    "1": "Quazepam 15 mg, triazolam 0.25 mg and placebo were administered to 12 healthy volunteers. Each drug was given for 14 nights using a balanced design with at least 28 days between drug administrations. A test battery of physiological, psychological and subjective measures was administered on the mornings of days 1, 8, 14, 15 and 22 of the drug and post-drug periods. Seven days prior to and on days 1 to 28 of the drug and post-drug periods, sleep and self evaluation questionnaires were completed. Quazepam was associated with definite EEG effects, an unexpected improvement in simple motor performance and an increase in several bodily symptoms and ratings of sedation. Triazolam-impaired performance and also increased ratings of bodily symptoms and sedation. Two symptom increases with triazolam--metallic taste and touch sensitivity--might reflect day-time rebound. Sleep quality was improved by both drugs. There was little evidence of tolerance to drug effects on EEG or psychomotor tests. However tolerance was seen to the bodily symptoms and mood ratings. Rebound after drug discontinuation was not convincingly detected.", 
    "2": "An observational analysis of the effects of four kappa-opioid agonists on forward locomotion, rearing and grooming displayed by rats in a novel open field was undertaken. The doses of agonists used corresponded to those previously found to produce changes in food consumption. Ethylketocyclazocine (0.1 and 1 mg/kg), bremazocine (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg) and tifluadom (0.3 and 3 mg/kg) exerted suppressant effects on all the activities monitored. Grooming behaviour appeared to be particularly sensitive to this action, being virtually abolished by the larger doses of these compounds. In contrast, the selective kappa agonist U-50,488H (0.1-3 mg/kg) only attenuated grooming at the two highest doses tested (1 and 3 mg/kg). None of the agonists tested produced stimulation of open field activity during the 1-h study. Reductions in activity occurred at doses previously found to increase and decrease food intake. It was therefore concluded that the hyperphagia induced by kappa agonists was not part of a more general behavioural activation, whilst reductions in food consumption probably result from a non-specific behavioural depression.", 
    "3": "1. The effect of chronic (19-day) treatment with the benzodiazepine tranquilizers diazepam (1 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and medazepam (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) on the binding characteristics of muscarinic receptors in four rat brain structures: cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and hypothalamus were studied using [3H]l-quinuclidinyl benzylate ([3H]QNB) as radioligand. 2. Diazepam and medazepam treatment caused an overall decrease in muscarinic receptor binding affinity (Kd). 3. The number (Bmax) of muscarinic receptors declined in the hippocampus and striatum and rose in the hypothalamus after both benzodiazepines. The Bmax of muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex was increased after diazepam treatment. 4. The changes in the binding characteristics of muscarinic receptors might be due to benzodiazepine-induced occurrence of two populations of muscarinic binding sites: P1 (high affinity, low capacity) and P2 (low affinity, high capacity). 5. The altered brain muscarinic receptor functions after chronic diazepam- or medazepam treatment suggest the role of cholinergic neurotransmission in the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines.", 
    "4": "The effects of a selective serotonin 1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), were studied in two animal models of anxiety. Peripherally injected 8-OH-DPAT in doses ranging from 0.125 to 2.0 mg/kg did not increase black-white transitions (BWT) and black square entries (BSE) in a two-compartment exploratory test or punished responding in a test of conditioned suppression of drinking. With 2.0 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT BSE and unpunished responding were reduced. In an investigation of the drinking time of water-deprived rats, naive or habituated to the test environment, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT increased the drinking time of naive rats but 2.0 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT reduced that of habituated animals. In animals deprived of water for 48 h or subjected to immobilization stress for 2 h, 1.0 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT increased BWT and BSE values in the two-compartment exploratory test. Infusions of 5 micrograms/0.5 microliter 8-OH-DPAT in the nucleus raphe medianus increased BWT and BSE values in the exploratory test and punished responding in the test of conditioned suppression of drinking, whereas the same dose of 8-OH-DPAT injected in the nucleus raphe dorsalis had no effect on punished but suppressed unpunished responding. The effects of 8-OH-DPAT are only detectable in the appropriate experimental conditions. When injected systemically, the effects are evident when a state of arousal of the animals contributes to the overall behavioural output. 8-OH-DPAT shows effects comparable to those of established anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates when it is injected in the nucleus raphe medianus, but not in the dorsalis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "5": "The present study evaluated the role of various neurotransmitter systems in mediating buspirone's blockade of the fear-potentiated startle effect, where acoustic startle amplitude is normally increase in the presence of a light previously paired with a shock. Large lesions of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei or IP injections of the serotonin antagonists cinanserin (10 mg/kg) or cyproheptadine (5 mg/kg) did not alter fear-potentiated startle, nor did these treatments prevent buspirone (5 or 10 mg/kg SC) from blocking fear-potentiated startle. The 5-HT 1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (2.5-10.0) did not block fear-potentiated startle even at doses that produced a marked \"5-HT syndrome\". Another 5-HT 1A agonist, ipsapirone (10-20 mg/kg), blocked potentiated startle only at a very high dose (40 mg/kg). p-Chlorophenylalanine and p-chloroamphetamine did not alter fear-potentiated startle. Finally, pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO-15-1788 (1 mg/kg); the opiate antagonist naloxone (2 mg/kg) or the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist yohimbine (5 mg/kg) did not reduce fear-potentiated startle, nor did they prevent buspirone from blocking fear-potentiated startle. Taken together, the data do not support the hypothesis that buspirone's anxiolytic effects are mediated by actions at 5-HT 1A receptors and more generally indicate that serotonergic neurons do not play an important role in fear-potentiated startle.", 
    "6": "The recognition that all minor tranquillizers carry the risk of dependence has had a significant impact in their prescription over the years. But it has only recently had the same impact on the prescribing of benzodiazepines because their dependence risks were not recognized until late. Approximately one third of all patients prescribed a benzodiazepine regularly for six weeks or longer will experience withdrawal symptoms if the drug is withdrawn suddenly after this time. Even if the drug is withdrawn gradually withdrawal symptoms may still lead to demands for further prescription. The major change in prescribing has been towards shorter and intermittent treatment so that tolerance is reduced and withdrawal symptoms avoided. This is appropriate for acute anxiety reactions but more difficult for longer term anxious and depressive neurotic disorders, which have a much longer natural history. Continuing evidence that other drugs not specifically marketed for the relief of anxiety, particularly the antidepressants, are effective in relieving this anxiety has led to increased prescription of antidepressants. Some patients may also be helped by treatment with beta-blocking drugs and new agents such as buspirone which have no significant dependence potential. There has also been a move away from drug treatment to psychological treatments for anxiety as a consequence of concern over dependence. For some conditions, particularly medical ones such as spasticity and epilepsy, benzodiazepines may be considered for long-term treatment. They may also be regarded as necessary for more severe psychiatric disorders, usually as an adjunct to other therapy. In such instances the dependence risk is acknowledged but the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh them. There may also be patients who are dependent on benzodiazepines but the alternative of withdrawing the drug may lead to dependence on a more dangerous drug such as alcohol. In such cases it is reasonable to regard continued prescription of the benzodiazepine as the least dangerous course of action. It is important to maintain a perspective of dependence on minor tranquillizers, particularly as attitudes are in danger of being distorted by excessive media attention. To date there is no evidence that dependence on benzodiazepines leads to any dangerous long term sequelae although there is concern over their effects on higher cognitive function. Nevertheless, the dangers of barbiturates, alcohol and nicotine are so much greater that it would be unfortunate if public concern led to excessive restrictions on the use of benzodiazepines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Detector responses showed linearity to temazepam concentrations over the range 0.075-0.60 mg/mL (r = 0.9999). Mean recovery of temazepam added to capsule excipients was 100.3%. Mean assay results for 15- and 30-mg hard gelatin capsules were 101.5 and 101.3%, respectively.

    "8": "The concomitant administration of diazepam and imipramine hydrochloride increased desipramine concentration in rat plasma, but decreased 2-hydroxyimipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine concentrations; the concomitant administration of oxazepam and imipramine hydrochloride decreased imipramine, 2-hydroxyimipramine, and 2-hydroxydesipramine concentrations. Imipramine plasma protein binding was unaltered in all cases. Liver concentrations of imipramine and 2-hydroxydesipramine were increased by concomitant administration of oxazepam and imipramine hydrochloride. Concomitant administration of benzodiazepines and imipramine hydrochloride increased imipramine concentration in the brain. The effects of imipramine hydrochloride on hypothermia induced by reserpine, and on behavioral despair in rats was also studied. The concomitant administration of diazepam and imipramine hydrochloride led to a decrease in the anti-reserpine effect of imipramine hydrochloride and in the imipramine hydrochloride-induced recovery from immobility in the forced swimming test. These results are in accord with the findings on brain concentrations of imipramine and its metabolites.", 
    "9": "Mouse killing by rats represents a predatory behavior that can be modified by drugs from several different therapeutic classes and by environmental conditions. Buspirone and gepirone, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics that stimulate serotonergic receptors (5HT1a) and inhibit isolation-induced intraspecies aggression, were tested for inhibition of muricidal behavior by isolated rats. Neither buspirone (3.0 mg/kg s.c.) nor gepirone (from 5.0 to 40 mg/kg) inhibited muricide. Additional rats were housed, either aggregated or isolated, and tested for muricidal behavior 9 times over 5 weeks to establish which animals were muricidal: thus, there were 4 groups of rats: muricidal or non-muricidal under either isolated or aggregated housing condition. [3H]-Spiperone was used to determine striatal D2 receptor Bmax and Kd and prefrontal cortex D2 and 5HT2 receptor binding. There were no changes across the four groups. Binding of [3H]-5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) to 5HT1a receptors decreased in septum of both groups of isolated rats and binding to 5HT1b receptors decreased 50% in hippocampus of isolated and aggregated muricidal rats. Binding of [3H]-5HT to either receptor was unchanged in amygdaloid area and hypothalamus across all groups. Thus, stimulating pre- and postsynaptic 5HT1a receptors does not alter muricidal behavior and changes in 5HT1 receptor binding occurs in limited areas. Whether this limited change in hippocampal 5HT1b binding is important for establishing muricidal behavior is unclear; however the direction of the change is consistent with reports that decreased serotonergic activity increases predatory behavior.", 
    "10": "Quazepam is a trifluoroethyl benzodiazepine hypnotic with a half-life of 27 to 41 hours, which has been shown to induce and maintain sleep in the short to long term (up to 4 weeks) treatment of patients with chronic or transient insomnia. Although its hypnotic efficacy has been well characterised against placebo, there are few clinical studies in comparison with established hypnotics, particularly over long term administration. However, preliminary evidence suggests that quazepam 15 to 30 mg is as effective as flurazepam and triazolam in usual therapeutic doses, and causes minimal rebound insomnia following its withdrawal, unlike rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines such as triazolam. The lack of rebound phenomena is likely to be attributable to the 'carryover' effects occurring after discontinuation of quazepam, which has pharmacologically active metabolites with half-lives of elimination similar to or longer than that of the parent drug. Probably because of the long half-lives of quazepam's metabolites, daytime sedation, fatigue and lethargy are the most frequently reported side effects. These side effects are most intense with the 30 mg dose and least with the 7.5mg dose, which has not been studied extensively. Hence, quazepam is an effective hypnotic which may be particularly suitable for short or medium term use in patients in whom withdrawal effects or rebound insomnia may be especially bothersome. Further definition of certain characteristics of its profile--such as its long term use and potential for development of tolerance or dependence, effects on psychomotor skills, efficacy of the 7.5mg dose, and suitability in elderly patients and patients with chronic organic diseases--will assist in more clearly defining its ultimate place in therapy.", 
    "11": "A double-blind trial of temazepam premedication for day cases was undertaken. Effective anxiolysis was recorded in the groups that received temazepam 10 or 20 mg and there was no prolongation of delayed recovery times as measured by memory test cards.

    "12": "Ketamine and midazolam were used for induction of anaesthesia and by continuous intravenous infusion for maintenance to assess their suitability for use in a total intravenous anaesthetic technique in the management of battle casualties. Muscular relaxation was provided by vecuronium and the patients' lungs ventilated with air. Ketamine was infused at a rate of 2 mg/kg/hour. This was achieved by mixing ketamine 200 mg, midazolam 5 mg and vecuronium 12 mg in 50 ml normal saline. The rate of infusion of the mixture (ml/hour) was then equal to 50% of the body weight in kg. The technique proved to be simple, effective and versatile and should be adaptable for use in the management of battle casualties.", 
    "13": "Baclofen and oxazepam enhance extinction of conflict behaviour in the Geller-Seifter test while baclofen and diazepam release punished behaviour in Vogel's conflict test. In order to investigate the possibility that the effect of the selective GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen is mediated indirectly via the GABA-A/benzodiazepine receptor complex, the effect of pretreatment of rats with baclofen on [3H]-diazepam binding to washed and unwashed cortical and cerebellar membranes of rats has been studied. Baclofen pretreatment increased Bmax in washed cerebellar membranes when bicuculline was present in the incubation mixture. No effect was seen in cortical membranes. The present results render it unlikely that the effect of baclofen on extinction of conflict behaviour and punished drinking is mediated via the GABA-A/benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "14": "The effects of triazolobenzodiazepines on GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake by membrane vesicles from rat cerebral cortex were examined. Triazolam and alprazolam showed a significant enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake at 0.01-10 microM. On the other hand, adinazolam showed a small enhancement at 0.1-1 microM followed by a significant inhibition of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake at 100 microM. The enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake by 1 microM alprazolam was antagonized by Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, but the inhibition of this response by 30 microM adinazolam was not antagonized by Ro15-1788. These results indicate that triazolobenzodiazepines enhanced GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake through benzodiazepine receptors. High concentrations of adinazolam inhibit GABA-stimulated 36Cl- uptake which may be due to the direct blockade of GABA-gated chloride channel.", 
    "15": "Buspirone and Mj 138-05 (up to 0.1 mM) did not displace specifically bound (3H) tryptamine, (3H) strychnine, (3H) flunitrazepam and (3H) imipramine in human cortical and hippocampal membrane preparations. At the same time both compounds displayed similar to serotonin affinity (IC50 in the range of 2-6 microM) for (125I)-LSD specific binding sites in the human cortex and hippocamp. IC50 of serotonin and buspirone and Mj 138-05 for (3H) LSD (2 nM) specific binding sites in the hippocamp was determined as 0.14 microM, 2.3 microM and 6.1 microM, respectively; and for (3H) serotonin specific binding sites in the hippocamp as 0.005 microM, 3.8 microM and 21 microM, respectively. The affinity for human cortex (3H) LSD binding sites was 10-fold lower in case of serotonin and 4-fold lower in case of buspirone and Mj 138-05 than in the hippocamp. However, the affinity for (3H) serotonin binding sites in the cortex was the same as in the hippocamp in case of serotonin and 12-15-fold lower than in the hippocamp in case of buspirone and Mj 138-05. It is concluded that in human brain buspirone and Mj 138-05 interact with micromolar affinity with 5 HT2 and are capable of binding to a subpopulation of 5 HT1 receptors in the hippocamp.", 
    "16": "Monoamine oxidase activity, lipid peroxidation and membrane structure were tested after chronic stress and 7-day treatment with drugs in the brain cortex synaptosomal membranes of rats.

    "17": "Temazepam elixir 30 mg by mouth was compared with i.v. Diazemuls titrated to a maximum dose of 20 mg in a double-blind study of 50 patients undergoing elective minor oral surgery. The treatments produced a similar reduction in anxiety score and similar degrees of patient relaxation and co-operation. The diazepam group had greater amnesia during surgery, but also showed significant slowing of reaction time at the time of discharge. Patients given temazepam elixir showed wide variations in plasma concentrations. Patients with low plasma temazepam concentrations at the time of surgery showed no significant reduction in anxiety scores.", 
    "18": "The hypnotic drug quazepam and its active metabolite 2-oxo-quazepam (2-oxo-quaz) are two benzodiazepines (BZ) containing a trifluoroethyl moiety on the ring nitrogen at position 1, characterized by their preferential affinity for Type I BZ recognition sites. In the present study we characterized the binding of 3H-2-oxo-quaz in discrete areas of the human brain. Saturation analysis demonstrated specific and saturable binding of 3H-2-oxo-quaz to membrane preparations from human cerebellum. Hill plot analysis of displacement curves of 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FNT) binding by 2-oxo-quaz yielded Hill coefficients of approximately 1 in the cerebellum and significantly less than 1 in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, caudate nucleus, thalamus and pons. Self and cross displacement curves for 3H-FNT and 3H-2-oxo-quaz binding in these brain areas indicated that 2-oxo-quaz binds with different affinities to two populations of binding sites. High affinity binding sites were more abundant in the cerebellum (95% of total sites), cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus, whereas low affinity sites were predominant in the caudate nucleus and pons. Competition studies of 3H-2-oxo-quaz (2 nM) and 3H-FNT (0.5 nM) using unlabelled ligands indicated that compounds which preferentially bind to Type I sites are more potent at displacing 3H-2-oxo-quaz than 3H-FNT from cerebral cortex membrane preparations. The results suggest that 3H-2-oxo-quaz may be used for selectively studying Type I BZ recognition sites in the human brain.", 
    "19": "Quazepam and 2-oxo-quazepam are novel benzodiazepines containing a trifluoroethyl substituent on the ring nitrogen at position #1. Detailed competition binding experiments (25 to 30 concs.) at 4 degrees C were undertaken with these compounds versus 3H-flunitrazepam using synaptic membranes from rat cortex or cerebellum. Unlike other benzodiazepines, both quazepam and 2-oxo-quazepam distinguished two populations of 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites in rat cortex which were present in roughly equal proportions and for which the compounds displayed a greater than 20-fold difference in affinity. In cerebellum, no such discrimination of sites was noted for 2-oxo-quazepam, but quazepam did distinguish a small, low affinity (15% of total) population of sites. 3H-2-oxo-quazepam was prepared and used in competition studies to substantiate the conclusion that these compounds discriminate two populations of benzodiazepine sites in rat cortex. This new radioligand was shown to specifically label BZ binding sites with high affinity in a saturable manner. The competition experiments were then conducted using 3H-2-oxo-quazepam at a radioligand concentration sufficiently low (0.5 nM) to ensure that only the higher affinity binding sites which 2-oxo-quazepam discriminates would be occupied. Competition experiments in both cortex and cerebellum under these conditions indicated single site binding for unlabelled quazepam and 2-oxo-quazepam in every instance. This suggests that 3H-2-oxo-quazepam should be a useful new tool for selectively labeling and studying the BZ1 population of benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "20": "Rat brain glutathione-S-transferases are rich in Yb type subunits with major RNA transcripts coding for a relatively uncommon Yb3 form. The Yb-containing isoenzymes of brain cytosol bind glucocorticoids and are covalently labeled with dexamethasone 21-methanesulfonate. Certain neurotransmitters, hormones, and drugs, such as serotonin, dopamine, glucocorticoids, thyroxine, apomorphine, and benzodiazepine derivatives, are effective inhibitors of brain glutathione transferase activity. Immunocytochemical studies show that Yb forms are localized in ependymal cells, subventricular zone cells, astrocytes, tanycytes, and astrocyte foot processes on blood vessels, but Yb was not detected in oligodendrocytes or neurons. Based on their localization and binding properties, brain glutathione-S-transferases have the potential to function in intracellular binding of a variety of compounds and thereby govern their uptake and release in brain, transport to neurons, as well as in their detoxification.", 
    "21": "Bipolar cells make reciprocal synapses with amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer; both feedforward connections and feedback connections are present. The physiological properties of the feedback synapse have not been well described. Since some amacrine cells are thought to be GABAergic, we examined bipolar cells for feedback input from gamma-aminobtyric acid (GABA)ergic amacrine cells. Solitary bipolar cells were dissociated enzymatically from the goldfish retina. Cells were voltage clamped with a patch pipette and their GABA sensitivity was examined. GABA evoked responses in all bipolar cells with a large axon terminal, which were identified to be the rod dominant ON type, and in some bipolar cells with a small axon terminal. The highest GABA sensitivity was located at the axon terminal. The least effective dose was as low as 100 nM. A small insignificant response of high threshold was evoked when GABA was applied to the dendrite and soma. GABA increased the Cl conductance and caused membrane hyperpolarization. The bipolar cells had the GABAA receptor coupled with a benzodiazepine receptor. The GABA-evoked response was not susceptible to Co ions, which suppressed the GABA-induced responses in turtle cones by 50% at 5 microM concentration. Incomplete desensitization was observed, suggesting that the GABAergic pathway seems capable of transmitting signals tonically. The present results strongly indicate that the rod-dominant ON-type bipolar cells and some bipolar cells with a small axon terminal receive negative feedback inputs from GABAergic amacrine cells.", 
    "22": "Recent findings suggest that steroids with sedative-hypnotic properties interact specifically with the gamma-aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine receptor-chloride ionophore complex (GBRC). They show positive heterotropic cooperativity by allosterically enhancing the binding of GABA agonists and the clinically useful benzodiazepines (BZs) to their respective recognition sites. These steroids have stringent structural requirements for activity at the GBRC, with the essential requirements for high potency being a 3 alpha-hydroxyl group and a 5 alpha-reduced A-ring. Some of these steroids are naturally occurring metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone and have nanomolar potencies as potentiators of chloride channel conductance. These 3 alpha-hydroxylated, 5 alpha-reduced steroids do not act through any known sites on the GBRC. Thus, the exact site and mechanism of action remain to be determined. Together with the observation that physiological levels of these metabolites are sufficient to influence the function of the GBRC, the evidence clearly suggests a role for these steroids in the normal regulation of brain excitability by potentiating the postsynaptic effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Pharmacological studies of the GBRC-active steroids show that they possess anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activities. The potential therapeutic application of these steroids in the treatment of mood disorders and catamenial exacerbation of seizures associated with the menstrual cycle is discussed. Collectively, the evidence from the studies of these steroids imply that another mechanism by which the endocrine system influences brain function has been identified. Its characterization will provide important insight into how steroids modulate brain excitability under normal and pathophysiological states.", 
    "23": "Neurological and cognitive deficits occur in many chronic alcoholic patients. Quantitative studies reveal a significant reduction in the number of neurons in the superior frontal gyrus of chronic alcoholics, with no change in the motor cortex. Our studies are aimed at delineating which neurotransmitter systems are altered in alcoholics and to correlate these alterations with morphometry and, where possible, clinical signs. Much evidence suggests both short- and long-term effects of ethanol on GABA-mediated neurotransmission. GABA and benzodiazepines bind to distinct, but allosterically linked, sites on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. In the absence of any detected difference in the number of benzodiazepine receptors in both the frontal and motor cortex from alcoholic and control patients, a significant increase in the amount of GABA enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding was measured in frontal cortex membranes from patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy relative to non-alcoholic controls. This finding suggests an increased coupling of the GABA and benzodiazepine recognition sites in this area, which may be due to ethanol-induced conformational changes in the receptor complex.", 
    "24": "As a tracer for in vivo studies on benzodiazepine receptors, 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-[11C]methyl-2H-1,4- benzodiazepin-2-one, [11C]fludiazepam, was synthesized by the methylation of nor-derivative with [11C]CH3I, and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Within 60 min [11C]fludiazepam was obtained for injection in high radiochemical yields and in high radiochemical purity with a specific activity of up to 230 mCi/mumol. After i.v. injection of [11C]fludiazepam in rats the radioactivity was rapidly incorporated into many tissues and the blood clearance of the radioactivity was very rapid. The brain uptake was high and decreased gradually. The adrenal uptake was the highest and decreased with high loading doses. The effect of the loading dose on the uptake was also found in the heart and lungs. By autoradiography using [11C]fludiazepam, a higher accumulation was visualized in the cortex and thalamus than in other regions.", 
    "25": "The aim of this paper was to determine whether the prolonged decrease in seizure threshold produced by chemical kindling was accompanied by behavioural changes in tests of anxiety and aggression. The responses of rats in five tests were examined after chronic treatment with the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG7142. This treatment caused chemical kindling, so that the originally proconvulsant drug caused full seizures. This effect is very long-lasting, and our previous work with mice had suggested that it might be accompanied by an increase in anxiety-related behavior. In the present work no significant differences were found between the behaviour of FG7142-kindled rats and vehicle-treated controls in social interaction test, elevated plus maze, or the Vogel conflict test of anxiety or in tests of home cage aggression or startle responses. The results therefore show that prolonged changes in seizure threshold can occur without alterations in the apparent level of anxiety.", 
    "26": "The pharmacokinetic profiles of oral and sublingual administrations of prazepam 20 mg to 5 normal volunteers were compared in order to explain the clinical observation that sublingual prazepam appears to exhibit sedative properties when compared to the same dose of oral prazepam. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation were collected just before drug intake and 7.5, 15, 22.5, 30, 45, 60, 90 min, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 24 h after drug intake. The study was performed in double-blind and crossover conditions. Serum levels of prazepam and its major metabolite N-desmethyl-diazepam were measured by HPLC. No prazepam was detected at a concentration higher than 20 ng/ml (limit of detection) whereas N-desmethyl-diazepam reached concentrations around 140 ng/ml. To correlate this observation with the clinical data, the affinity of prazepam and N-desmethyl-diazepam was compared measuring their ability to displace 50% of 3H-flunitrazepam bound to benzodiazepine receptors contained in synaptosomal preparation obtained from rat brain. N-desmethyl-diazepam was 17-fold more potent than prazepam. This data suggests that prazepam is a pro-drug which is transformed to the active compound N-desmethyl-diazepam and that the difference in clinical observation with both administrations could be correlated to N-desmethyl-diazepam concentration-time curves. Nevertheless, the comparison of the area under the N-desmethyl-diazepam serum concentration-time curves, the maximum concentrations, the times when the maximum concentrations were observed and the times needed to detect a significant level after oral and sublingual administration did not show statistical difference.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Undernourished animals showed higher response rates in the VR-20 schedule and a lower efficiency in the DRLR-5 as compared to controls, effects that could be attributed to the hyperreactivity to aversive or stressful situations characteristic of these animals. As the behavioral responses to anxiogenic stimuli are sensitive to drugs acting on the GABAergic system, the functionalism of the central GABAergic system in the undernourished group was evaluated by studying the reactivity to the anticonflict effect of diazepam in two conflict tests. Undernourished animals had a lower response to the anticonflict effect of diazepam when compared to control rats. The altered reactivity to the anticonflict effect of diazepam between both groups suggest that some aspects of the GABAergic neurotransmission may be involved in the behavioral abnormalities present in adult rats that were undernourished at perinatal age.", 
    "29": "The effects of 21 days of haloperidol treatment on central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in the cerebral cortex of rats and on peripheral-type BZ binding sites (PBS) in the cerebral cortex and heart of rats were studied. Neuroleptic treatment did not affect the maximal binding capacity or the affinity of the central BZ receptor to 3H-flunitrazepam. Chronic haloperidol treatment resulted in a significant increase of 38% in PBS density in the cerebral cortex, with no alteration in PBS density in the heart. No alteration in PBS affinity for its ligand 3H-PK 11195 was observed, either in the cerebral cortex or in the heart. The modulatory effect of chronic haloperidol administration on PBS density in the brain may be related to some of the neurobehavioral or hormonal effects of the drug.", 
    "30": "In male mice, the biologically significant experience of social defeat is associated with an acute non-opioid form of analgesia. Recent studies have shown that this reaction is sensitive to certain benzodiazepine receptor ligands but is unaffected by others. The present experiments were designed to assess the possibility that activity at \"non-neuronal\" benzodiazepine binding sites might account for this unusual pharmacological profile. Our results show that defeat analgesia was blocked by clonazepam (0.06-3 mg/kg), Ro05-4864 (2.5-20 mg/kg), Ro05-5115 (20 mg/kg), PK11195 (5-20 mg/kg) and PK14067 (10-20 mg/kg). Furthermore, when given in combination, subthreshold doses of PK11195 (2.5 mg/kg) and clonazepam (0.03 mg/kg) totally prevented defeat analgesia. All of these effects were observed in the absence of intrinsic activity on basal nociception. Together with earlier findings, current data imply that inhibition of defeat analgesia by ligands for neuronal and/or non-neuronal benzodiazepine recognition sites is most probably unrelated to their activity at these sites. Alternative explanations for the overall patterns of results are considered.", 
    "31": "We have previously shown that cultured astrocytes from neonatal rat cerebral cortex are depolarized by GABA. The underlying ionic mechanism, activation of a Cl- conductance and responses to an agonist and antagonists were found to be similar to those of the neuronal GABAA receptor (Kettenmann et al.: Brain Research 404:1-9, 1987; Kettenmann and Schachner: Journal of Neuroscience 5:3295-3301, 1985). To characterize further the pharmacological properties of the GABA receptor we have tested the influence of pentobarbital and benzodiazepines on the GABA response. Pentobarbital potentiated and prolonged the GABA-induced depolarization and enhanced the velocity of the depolarization. Agonists of the neuronal benzodiazepine receptor, flunitrazepam, diazepam, and midazolam, increased the GABA-induced depolarization. As in neurons, an antagonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, Ro 15-1788, blocked the flunitrazepam-induced enhancement of the GABA response. In contrast to their effects on neurons, the inverse agonists Ro 22-7497 and DMCM increased the GABA-induced depolarization. The ligand of the putative peripheral benzodiazepine binding site, Ro 5-4864, did not show consistent effects on the GABA response. These studies confirm that cultured astrocytes express GABAA receptors. This receptor is similar to the neuronal GABAA receptor with regard to Cl- conductance and its pharmacological responses to muscimol, bicuculline, picrotoxin, pentobarbital, and benzodiazepine agonists and an antagonist, but it is different in its responses to inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine site. The physiological role of the glial GABAA receptor is at present unknown.", 
    "32": "It has recently been claimed that RO 15-4513 selectively opposes some of the behavioral actions of ethanol. Our studies on the intrinsic effects of this compound have shown it to be proconvulsant and to reduce exploratory behavior in mice. In these respects RO 15-4513 resembles a benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist. Such intrinsic actions may well explain its alcohol-antagonizing properties, and argue against its potential in humans. In addition to partially reversing the effects of ethanol, RO 15-4513 also partially reverses the behavioral effect of a barbiturate and completely reverses the effects of a benzodiazepine.", 
    "33": "1. Benzodiazepine receptors have been characterized in human brain mainly using [3H]-Ro 15-1788 and [3H]-flunitrazepam. Both ligands present a very high affinity for the receptor sites (Kd values of 0.56 and 1.53 nM respectively). 2. GABA enhanced the affinity of [3H]-flunitrazepam and [3H]-diazepam, but not that of [3H]-Ro 15-1788 and [3H]-methyl-beta-carboline 3-carboxylate for their specific binding sites as well in cerebral as in cerebellar human cortex. 3. Subcellular distribution of the benzodiazepine receptors revealed a main synaptosomal localization in human cerebral cortex, cerebellum and striatum. 4. Solubilized benzodiazepine receptors were obtained using 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and were characterized with [3H]-Ro 15-1788. The solubilized receptors are still coupled to GABA receptors since the [3H]-flunitrazepam specific binding was enhanced in the presence of micromolar concentrations of GABA.", 
    "34": "Electrophysiology of BZR ligands has been reviewed from different points of view. A great effort was made to critically discuss the arguments for and against the temporarily leading hypothesis of the mechanism of action of BZR ligands, the GABA hypothesis. As has been discussed at length in the present article, an impressive body of electrophysiological and biochemical evidence suggests an enhancement of GABAergic inhibition in CNS as a mechanism of action of BZR agonists. Biochemical data even indicate a physical coupling between GABA recognition sites and BZR which, together with the effector site build-up by Cl- channels, form a supramolecular GABAA/BZR complex. By binding to a specific site on this complex, BZR agonists allosterically increase and BZR inverse agonists decrease the gating of GABA-linked Cl- channels, whereas BZR antagonists bind to the same site without an appreciable intrinsic activity and block the binding and action of both agonists as well as inverse agonists. While this model is supported by many electrophysiological experiments performed with BZR ligands in higher nanomolar and lower micromolar concentrations, it does not explain much controversial data from animal behavior and, more importantly, is not in line with electrophysiological effects obtained with low nanomolar BZ concentrations. The latter actions of BZR ligands in brain slices occur within a concentration range compatible with concentrations of BZ observed in CSF fluid, which would be expected to be found in the biophase (receptor level) during anxiolytic therapy in man. Enhanced K+ conductance seems to be a suitable candidate for this effect of BZR ligands. This direct action on neuronal membrane properties may underlie the many electrophysiological observations with extremely low systemic doses of BZR ligands in vivo which demonstrated a depressant effect on spontaneous neuronal firing in various CNS regions. Skeletomuscular spasticity and epilepsy are two neurological disorders, where both the enhanced GABAergic inhibition and increased K+ conductance may contribute to the therapeutic effect of BZR agonists, since electrophysiological and behavioral studies strongly support GABA-dependent as well as GABA-independent action of BZR ligands elicited by low to intermediate doses of BZ necessary to evoke anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects. Somewhat higher doses of BZR ligands, inducing sedation and sleep, lead perhaps to the only pharmacologically relevant CNS concentrations (ca. 1 microM) which might be due entirely to increased GABAergic inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "35": "We investigated the possibility that repeated electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala (kindling) would increase punished behavior, a pre-clinical indicator of anti-anxiety activity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, prepared with electrodes in the left basolateral nucleus and frontal cortex, were trained to bar-press under a multiple schedule in which either every 30th response produced food (no punishment) or every 10th response produce both food and a brief electric shock (punishment). Rates of punished responding were less than 10% of non-punished values. Brief electrical stimulation of the amygdala occurred biweekly, and the current levels were incremented from subconvulsive values (50 microA) to suprathreshold levels (150 microA). Electrical stimulation increased punished responding without concomitant changes in nonpunished behavior; increases were most pronounced in fully-kindled rats. Fully-kindled animals also demonstrated the largest primary afterdischarge. Electrical stimulation of the frontal cortex induced similar seizure and convulsive patterns but did not increase punished responding. Anxiolytic activity of amygdaloid stimulation was not prevented by the selective benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788, which antagonized similar behavioral effects of chlordiazepoxide. Thus, kindling of seizures in the amygdala results in behaviorally and neuroanatomically specific antianxiety actions which do not depend upon receptor sites blocked by Ro 15-1788 (benzodiazepine receptors).", 
    "36": "In 100 and 200 mumol/l concentration, pyritinol inhibited GABA binding to the GABA receptors of brain synaptosomal membranes. GABA receptors from the cerebral cortex, diencephalon and striatum were inhibited to approximately the same degree; those from the cerebellum and spinal cord were inhibited more. Both high and low affinity receptors were inhibited. Pyritinol did not greatly affect the number of binding sites (Bmax), but reduced the affinity (raised the dissociation constant KD) of both receptors. The benzodiazepine receptor, which is connected with the postsynaptic GABAA receptor, was also inhibited by pyritinol. The character of inhibition was the same as for GABA receptors, i.e. there was no change in the number of binding sites, but there was a decrease in their affinity. It is assumed that the similarity of the effect on GABA and benzodiazepine receptors is associated with their occurrence on one, or on two relatively firmly interconnected, protein molecules. Depression of the affinities of GABA and the associated benzodiazepine receptor, together with inhibition of GABA synthesis, in the presence of pyritinol indicate that diminished activity of the GABA system in the brain might be related to the activating effect of pyritinol.", 
    "37": "The benzodiazepines had already been in wide use as anxiolytics and anticonvulsants for more than ten years before their site of action in the central nervous system, the benzodiazepine receptor, was discovered. Simultaneously, a binding site in the peripheral organs, e.g. heart, lungs and kidneys, was found. Although some benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, bind to both central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors with a high affinity, these two binding sites exhibit quite different properties. It is already clear that the central benzodiazepine receptors are in many regions of the brain coupled with the receptors for gamma-amino butyric acid, and they mediate the acute actions of benzodiazepines in the central nervous system. Through them opposite effects, such as anxiety and convulsions, can also be evoked by using inverse agonists, e.g. some beta-carbolines. All these effects can be blocked with benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, some of which are already used as specific antidotes against benzodiazepine overdose. The multitude of pharmacological effects that can be produced through central benzodiazepine receptors provides a good opportunity for the development of new drugs. The role of the peripheral-type receptors is less clear, but it seems that they are connected with more slowly-appearing drug actions, such as modulation of cell proliferation. Now that endogenous ligands for both the central-type (a peptide called diazepam binding inhibitor; DBI) and for the peripheral-type (porphyrins) benzodiazepine receptors have been discovered, even more productive research can be expected.", 
    "38": "Secondary generalized epilepsy in childhood, characterized by absences or minor motor seizures, occurs in the forms of various syndromes, as defined by current classifications. EEG often shows continuous or subcontinuous paroxysmal activity associated with partly reversible psychomotor or mental regression. The paroxysmal activity can exhibit one of two distinct patterns: \"organized\" or \"disorganized,\" although intermediate forms are common. The two patterns differ not only morphologically but also in the responsiveness to drug or hormone therapy, reactivity to stimuli, sleep changes and frequency of disordered slow rhythms. These features are illustrated by means of a survey of 10 cases.", 
    "39": "The classification of benzodiazepine receptor ligands into agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists is based on biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioural evidence. Agonists potentiate the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and exhibit anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, amnesic and muscle-relaxant properties; inverse agonists show mirror-image effects in that they may be convulsant and anxiogenic and may increase muscle tone. Antagonists antagonise the effects of both agonists and inverse agonists. Some of the most interesting ligands, however, are those substances with actions intermediate between either those of the agonists and the antagonists, or between those of the antagonists and the inverse agonists. These partial agonists and partial inverse agonists possess only some of the properties of the agonists and inverse agonists, respectively. The present experiments show that the agonist and inverse agonist properties of benzodiazepine receptor ligands can also be revealed in an animal continuous attention task in which rats were required to detect a brief signal during which operation of a lever was rewarded by food. Benzodiazepines and a beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor agonist, ZK 93423, disrupted performance of this task, as did the antimuscarinic substance, scopolamine. Another beta-carboline, ZK 91296, which has anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties like benzodiazepines, did not affect performance of the continuous attention task, demonstrating a separation of anxiolytic and sedative properties of such substances. A partial inverse agonist beta-carboline, FG 7142, was able to antagonise the disruptive effects of scopolamine on this task, as was, to a smaller extent, the antagonist ZK 93426. These results are discussed in terms of vigilance-enhancing properties of the inverse agonist beta-carbolines, and the possibility that such vigilance-enhancing effects might contribute to improvement of performance in learning tasks.", 
    "40": "Transient brain ischemia results in a selective destruction of cell bodies within the hippocampus and cortex. This cellular destruction appears to be mediated through a release of endogenous exictatory amino acids following the ischemic episode, since the neurotoxic effects of ischemia can be attenuated by compounds that have antagonist activity at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. In the present study, the protective effects of a novel NMDA receptor antagonist, CGS 19755, were further evaluated by using quantitative autoradiography to characterize adenosine A1, NMDA, PCP, and benzodiazepine receptors in ischemic gerbil brain. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (20 minutes) resulted in marked decreases (30-60%) in adenosine A1, NMDA, and PCP, but not benzodiazepine, receptors in gerbil forebrain. Postischemic treatment with CGS 19755 was found to completely block the ischemia-induced decreases in brain adenosine and NMDA receptors. [3H]TCP binding in ischemic gerbil brain was also elevated by CGS 19755 treatment; significant differences remained, however, between the CGS 19755-treated and control gerbils. These results indicate that transient brain ischemia produces significant and selective alterations in gerbil forebrain receptor systems. The observed decreases in radioligand binding are probably reflective of an ischemia-induced destruction of forebrain structures. However, there is some evidence that transient ischemia can also cause long-term changes in the affinity of some receptor systems. The postischemic efficacy of CGS 19755 appears to be due to its ability to block the neurotoxic effects of transient ischemia.", 
    "41": "The aim of the present study was to compare the ability of Ro 15-4513 and FG 7142, two inverse agonists for benzodiazepine recognition sites, to antagonize the EEG effects of ethanol in freely moving rats. Ethanol (2.5 g/kg, p.o.) induced sedation and ataxia associated with a progressive suppression of the fast cortical activities and an enhancement of low frequencies in both cortical and hippocampal tracings. In contrast, Ro 15-4513 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) and FG 7142 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) both caused a state of alertness associated with desynchronized cortical activity and theta hippocampal rhythm as well as spiking activity which was predominantly observed in the cortical tracings. When rats were treated with FG 7142 or RO 15-4513 either before or after ethanol, a reciprocal antagonism of the behavioral and EEG effects of ethanol and of the partial inverse agonists was observed. These data support the view that the anti-ethanol effects of Ro 15-4513 may be related to its partial inverse agonist properties.", 
    "42": "The early ontogeny of the central benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) was investigated in human embryos and fetuses between 7 and 26 weeks of gestation. Brain tissue was gained from terminated pregnancies or spontaneous abortions. Binding studies, which were performed with 3H-flunitrazepam (FNZ), revealed that specific benzodiazepine binding is already detectable at an embryonal age of 7 weeks post conceptionem. Binding at this early stage can be displaced potently by clonazepam and the inverse agonist beta-CCE. Additionally, 3H-FNZ binding is enhanced by GABA. Thus, benzodiazepine binding is of the central type. Receptor density increases steeply in whole brain between weeks 8 and 11 of gestation. In frontal cortex receptor density increases gradually between weeks 12 and 26 of gestation. No specific fetal disease entity (including trisomy 21) was consistently associated with exceptionally high or low Bmax-values.", 
    "43": "The pharmacologic effects of benzodiazepines may be counteracted either by functional antagonists like physostigmine acting via cholinergic mechanisms or by competitive antagonists like flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) acting via GABAergic mechanisms (GABA = Gamma-AminoButyric Acid). The lipophilic choline esterase inhibitor physostigmine adjusts a relatively or absolutely decreased concentration of acetylcholine at central cholinergic synaptic sites. As the neuronal network is very complex, many lipophilic compounds may cause a central anticholinergic syndrome even if they primarily do not affect cholinergic but, like benzodiazepines, GABAergic synaptic sites. Prolonged and/or adverse effects of such drugs may therefore be treated with 1-2 mg physostigmine at a maximal rate of 1 mg/min. The onset of physostigmine action can be expected within 2-20 min. Furthermore, the benzodiazepine action can very effectively be counteracted by the specific antagonist flumazenil. It could be demonstrated in volunteer and clinical studies that the hypnotic effect of benzodiazepines could be antagonized within 1-2 min. However, the minimal duration of action proved to be about 2 h as could be demonstrated by clinical observations, EEG-studies and psychometric tests. In clinical practice, a flumazenil dose of 0.3-0.8 mg proved to be the optimal dose range. The indication to treat unwanted central effects of benzodiazepines either with flumazenil or with physostigmine after anaesthesia should be restricted to cases of distinctly prolonged sedation after adequate dosage or adverse side effects. In intensive care, special indications for flumazenil and/or physostigmine may result after high benzodiazepine dosage or to differentiate a coma of undefined origin if centrally acting drugs including benzodiazepines are involved.", 
    "44": "ICU patients often require sedation. Midazolam (M), a new imidazobenzodiazepine, features rapid onset and rapid elimination time. Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) is a new benzodiazepine antagonist. We studied the efficacy and safety of M by continuous infusion in 28 ICU patients: 16 post major surgery, and 12 medical patients, aged 20-77 years. M was administered as a loading dose of 0.05-0.15 mg/kg per min followed by continuous infusion of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg per h titrated to maintain patients asleep but arousable. M was administered for up to 14 days in doses of 1-15 mg/h and cumulative doses of up to 1915 mg. No untoward effects were noted except for slight decreases in blood pressure following the loading dose. ACTH challenge tests performed before and 24 h or more following the start of M showed no depression of adrenal responsivity. All patients meeting weaning criteria were weaned off mechanical ventilation while still on M. In 13 patients extubation was performed immediately after M was stopped, and flumazenil (0.38 +/- 0.27 mg, i.v.) given until full awakening. Patients remained awake yet calm. Vital signs remained stable after flumazenil. Midazolam by continuous infusion appears to be a safe and effective mode of sedation in ICU patients. Flumazenil may increase the flexibility and safety of this mode of sedation.",

Product I was prepared by N-alkylation of the desmethyl compound (Ro 15-5528) with [11C]methyl iodide and product II was prepared by esterification of the desethyl compound (Ro 15-3890) with [11C]ethyl iodide. Ro 15-3890, the main metabolic product of Ro 15-1788, was labelled by two synthetic routes.

In route B, III was prepared by a subsequent hydrolysis of I. The radiochemical yields were on the order of 15-60% (EOB) with an overall synthesis time of 40-50 min.

None of the chemical measures showed significant correlation with age, sex, or postmortem delay. As expected, ChAT and AChE activities were closely correlated with one another overall and within the AD and control groups, and the mean values for the AD group were significantly less than those in the controls in each of the cortical regions examined. Specific binding site densities were very variable from brain to brain and did not correlate with ChAT in any group or overall. By analysis of variance, however, binding site densities in the AD group were significantly higher than those in the controls. This difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.05) in Broca's area and the precentral and postcentral gyri, but not in the temporal gyri which generally have greater neuronal loss in AD. Of the 15 miscellaneous neurological cases, the Parkinson patients (n = 3) showed significantly higher binding densities than the controls but the multiinfarct dementia group (n = 5) did not.

    "47": "Ca2+-channel blockers are shown to modulate, like peripheral benzodiazepines, the oxidative burst induced by arachidonic acid in the macrophage-like P 388D1 cell line. Nifedipine (1 and 10 nM) enhanced the cellular response to arachidonate; this stimulation by nifedipine was reversed by PK 1195, a specific antagonist for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site. Verapamil (5 microM), on the other hand, antagonized the stimulation of the oxidative burst by benzodiazepines. The data suggest some possible interaction of Ca2+-channel blockers at the benzodiazepine binding site or at a secondary step in the activation mechanism. None of the molecules modulated the calcium influx triggered by arachidonate. Instead, the oxidative response of P 388D1 cells to arachidonate was inhibited by K+-channel blockers, quinidine and tetraethylammonium bromide.",

GABAA agonists stimulate 36Cl-influx in these cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The enhancing effect of GABA is potentiated by BZ agonists, inhibited by GABA antagonists, and attenuated by the inverse agonist beta-carboline, DMCM. These cells also exhibit the specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam with a pharmacological specificity of the central BZ receptors.

    "49": "The specific binding of 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) was studied in synaptosomal membranes of rat cerebral cortex. The displacing potencies of eleven CNS depressants and three convulsants were determined in the presence of 1 microM GABA and 10 nM R 5135. GABA enhanced the displacing potencies of depressants of most diverse chemical structures: diaryltriazine (LY 81067), pyrazolopyridine (etazolate), cinnamide, glutarimide, 2,3-benzodiazepine (tofizopam) and alcohol derivatives, barbiturates, (+)etomidate, methaqualone and meprobamate. In contrast, the IC50 values of convulsants (picrotoxinin, pentetrazol and the barbiturate enantiomer S(+) MPPB) were not significantly affected. The depressants accelerated either basal or GABA-augmented dissociation of 35-TBPS mainly by increasing the contribution of its rapid first phase.", 
    "50": "Benzodiazepine binding sites have generally been labelled with benzodiazepine agonists: (3H)flunitrazepam and (3H)diazepam in vivo. We studied the in vivo binding of the antagonist (3H)Ro 15-1788 in mice and compared it to the in vivo binding of (3H)flunitrazepam. For this in vivo labelling, mice were injected with labelled and unlabelled ligands. Animals were then sacrificed and bound radioactivity was measured after homogenization of the excised brain and filtration of the homogenate. (3H)Ro 15-1788 is a better tool than (3H)flunitrazepam for in vivo labelling of benzodiazepine receptors since 1) it labels specifically the central type binding sites, 2) injection of 4 times less (3H)Ro 15-1788 (50 microCi/kg) than (3H)flunitrazepam (200 microCi/kg) produced the same amount of bound radioactivity, 3) 70-90% of the total (3H)Ro 15-1788 present in the brain is membrane bound instead of 45-55% with (3H)flunitrazepam, 4) maximal binding of (3H)Ro 15-1788 is reached within 3 min, 5) only 5% of the membrane bound (3H)Ro 15-1788 is nonspecific instead of 15% for (3H)flunitrazepam.", 
    "51": "Parenteral administration of the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 (a high affinity ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor with partial inverse agonist qualities) produced a dose dependent reduction in sleep time of mice exposed to the inhalation anesthetic, methoxyflurane. The reductions in methoxyflurane sleep time ranged from approximately 20% at 4 mg/kg to approximately 38% at 32 mg/kg of Ro 15-4513. Co-administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (16 mg/kg) or the inverse agonists DMCM (5-20 mg/kg) and FG 7142 (22.5 mg/kg) blocks this effect which suggests that the reductions in methoxyflurane sleep time produced by Ro 15-4513 are mediated via occupation of benzodiazepine receptors. Moreover, neither DMCM (5-20 mg/kg) nor FG 7142 (22.5 mg/kg) reduced methoxyflurane sleep time which suggests this effect of Ro 15-4513 cannot be attributed solely to its partial inverse agonist properties. These observations support recent findings that inhalation anesthetics may produce their depressant effects via perturbation of the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor chloride channel complex, and suggest that Ro 15-4513 may serve as a prototype of agents capable of antagonizing the depressant effects of inhalation anesthetics such as methoxyflurane.", 
    "52": "Molecular and conformational characteristics of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in cortex and cerebellum from long-sleep and short-sleep mice were investigated using heat inactivation and beta-carboline competition techniques. To investigate differences in the allosteric coupling between GABA and BZ receptors, the protection of BZ receptors from heat inactivation, by GABA, was also evaluated. The two genotypes do not differ in the affinity or number of BZ receptors in the cortex or cerebellum. They do, however, appear to differ in the molecular structure and/or regulation of the conformational state of the receptor in the cortex, as indicated by a greater sensitivity of LS mice to both heat inactivation and beta-carboline competition of 3H-flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding in this region. Evidence for differences in the nature of coupling between GABA and BZ receptors is provided by the finding that in both regions, GABA protected BZ receptors from inactivation to a greater degree in LS mice. The relationship between these differences and the multiplicity of expression of BZ receptors is discussed.", 
    "53": "3-Ethoxy-beta-carboline binds with high affinity to benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system (Ki approximately equal to 10.1, 15.3, and 25.3 nM in rat cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus, respectively). This compound has pharmacological actions reminiscent of benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonists such as FG 7142 and 3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline. Thus, while not a convulsant, 3-ethoxy-beta-carboline potentiated the convulsant actions of pentylenetetrazole in mice. Furthermore, this compound reduced both the time spent and the total entries in the open arms of an elevated plus maze and also inhibited stress-induced ulcer formation, effects that are also observed with benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists. These findings suggest that 3-ethoxy-beta-carboline is a partial inverse agonist at benzodiazepine receptors which may prove useful for in vivo studies since it has a higher affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and better solubility than the commonly used partial inverse agonist FG 7142. Furthermore, 3-ethoxy-beta-carboline appears to be less vulnerable to metabolic degradation than ester analogs with a similar pharmacological profile such as 3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline.", 
    "54": "L-lysine, an essential amino acid for man and animals, and its metabolite pipecolic acid (PA) have been studied for their effects on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice. L-Lysine or L-PA i.p. significantly increased clonic and tonic latencies in a dose-dependent manner against 90 mg/kg PTZ-induced seizures. L-Lysine but not L-PA enhanced the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam (DZ) (0.2 mg/kg). L-PA (0.1 mmol/kg) i.c.v. showed a slight decrease in clonic latency; it did not enhance the antiseizure activity of DZ; it caused seizures at 0.6 mmol/kg. D-PA (0.1 mmol/kg) i.c.v. displayed an opposite effect compared to its L-isomer. The anticonvulsant effect of L-lysine in terms of increase in seizure latency and survival was even more amplified when tested with a submaximal PTZ concentration (65 mg/kg). L-Lysine showed an enhancement of specific 3H-flunitrazepam (FZ) binding to mouse brain membranes both in vitro and in vivo. The possibility of L-lysine acting as a modulator for the GABA/benzodiazepine receptors was demonstrated. Since L-PA showed enhancement of 3H-FZ binding only in vitro but not in vivo, the anticonvulsant effect of L-PA may not be linked to the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "55": "The possibility that there are changes in brain benzodiazepine binding sites controlled by photoperiod was investigated in two strains of male rats. The hypothesis was tested by 3H-diazepam binding studies in various brain regions of prepubertal rats maintained in 14 or 10 h of light or treated with late-afternoon injections of melatonin (50 micrograms/day). Protein restriction was applied during the experiment to sensitise the animals to the treatments. Under the conditions employed, rats kept in short daylength throughout or kept on long photoperiod and given late-afternoon melatonin injections showed evidence of delayed puberty (seminal vesicle, ventral prostate, and testis weight decreased by 45%, 55%, and 60% respectively, compared to control rats). Binding measurements were made 1 h before and 2 and 5 h after the onset of darkness in the pubertal (42-day-old) or experimentally prepubertal rats. In the rats of the Porton strain (for which protein restriction was obligatory for the gonadal response) there was no consistent treatment or time effects on specific binding of 3H-diazepam to washed membranes of the hypothalamus, midbrain, or striatum. Similarly, there were no differences in the stimulation of 3H-diazepam binding by 100 microM GABA or the inhibition of binding by 50 microM N-acetyl 5 methoxy kynurenamine. By contrast, in Wistar rats, specific binding to midbrain membranes was reduced 5 h after dark compared to 2 h (37% saline; 20% melatonin) and the extent of stimulation by GABA in the hypothalamus was increased 5 h after darkness (35.6% to 46.7% saline; 37.4% to 50% melatonin). Melatonin treatment resulted in significantly higher specific binding in the hypothalamus 2 h after dark (10%, control fed; 20%, protein restricted) but reduced the GABA induced stimulation of binding in the midbrain (35.5% to 25%, control fed; 33.7% to 23.5%, protein restricted). The Bmax of benzodiazepine binding to unwashed cortical P2 synaptosomal membranes has been reported to increase twofold in adult Wistar rats at mid-dark. By contrast the Bmax of juvenile Wistar rats in this study increased only 17% (116 +/- 2.4 fmol/mg protein to 140 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein) between 2 and 5 h after darkness. In melatonin-treated animals the increase in Bmax of 3H-diazepam binding was blocked (124 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein at 2 h; 127 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein at 5 h) and the Kd reduced (4.5 +/- 0.5 to 4.0 +/- 0.2 nM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "56": "Understanding the mechanisms of action of anticonvulsant drugs has been a major research effort of neuroscientists for the last three decades. Numerous biochemical and electrophysiological processes have been shown to be modulated by anticonvulsant drugs. However, clear correlations of these effects with anticonvulsant activity are often difficult to determine. Over the last 5 years, several major research areas have developed that shed new light on the mechanisms of action of anticonvulsant drugs. Although a complete discussion of all aspects of anticonvulsant research are not possible in the scope of this article, a description of benzodiazepine receptors, mechanisms involved in neuronal sustaining repetitive firing, and calcium regulation of neuronal function have direct bearing on neuronal excitability and ultimately on anticonvulsant drug effect. Each of these major research areas has opened new insights into our understanding of molecular mechanisms of how anticonvulsant drugs work.", 
    "57": "Urinary output of homovanillic acid and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymandelic acid was decreased both in patients with panic attacks and in normal controls during lactate infusion, whereas that of tribulin (an endogenous monoamine oxidase inhibitor and benzodiazepine receptor binding inhibitor) was increased. There was no change in urinary excretion of any of these compounds during saline infusion. These findings provide further evidence of a link between tribulin output and stress and anxiety in man and point to its possible in vivo action as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.", 
    "58": "The influence of slow muscarinic postsynaptic potentials, i.e., the s-IPSP and s-EPSP, on synaptic transmission mediated through nicotinic receptors was studied in the superior cervical ganglion of the rabbit. Postganglionic spikes and synaptic potentials were elicited by delivery of conditioning and test stimulus pulses to afferent fibers. When paired stimulus volleys were separated by brief intervals (20-100 msec) or long intervals (1,000-8,000 msec), the population spike elicited by the test stimulus was larger in amplitude than that elicited by the conditioning volley. When paired stimulus volleys were separated by 250-500 msec, the amplitude of the population spike elicited by the test volley was smaller than that elicited by the conditioning stimulus. Gallamine, which selectively blocks the s-IPSP, reduced the suppression of the test spike which occurred when stimulus IPIs ranged between 250-500 msec. Pirenzepine, which selectively blocks the s-EPSP, reduced the late facilitation of test postganglionic spikes which occurred with stimulus IPIs greater than 1,000 msec. The non-selective muscarinic antagonist QNB, produced changes in postganglionic spike amplitude that were similar to the combined effects of gallamine and pirenzepine. The evidence indicates that the s-IPSP and s-EPSP modified the excitability state of the ganglionic neurons and subsequent synaptic transmission that was mediated through nicotinic receptors.", 
    "59": "Recent reports have demonstrated that the synthetic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-derivative, SR 95531 [2-(3'-carbethoxy-2'-propyl)-3-amino-6-paramethoxy-phenyl-pyrid azinium bromide], possesses selective GABAA antagonistic properties. Because of its potency for recognition of GABAA sites, this agent has been used to identify GABAA receptors. In the present investigation, we studied the binding of [3H]SR 95531 to tissue sections of rat brain using microscopic analysis of receptor localization. The appropriate binding conditions for defining GABAA receptors with this radioligand were obtained by determining the dissociation and association kinetics, and performing saturation and displacement studies. Using membrane preparations from whole rat brain (or brain regions representing cortex, striatum, hippocampus, midbrain-thalamus, medulla-pons and cerebellum), saturation and displacement studies were analyzed, and allosteric modulation of [3H]SR 95531 binding was examined by including several benzodiazepine and barbiturate receptor ligands in the incubation media. To assess the stereoselective properties of [3H]SR 95531 binding in rat membranes, numerous barbiturates were added during the incubation. The binding of [3H]SR 95531 was demonstrated to be saturable, specific and to bind with relatively high affinity to low-affinity GABAA sites. Scatchard analysis performed on saturation data of binding to tissue sections showed a dissociation constant (KD) of 42.4 nM and a maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of 105.8 fmol/mg tissue. Microscopic analysis showed that intermediate to high densities of [3H]SR 95531 binding occurred in brain regions containing intermediate to high densities of low-affinity GABAA receptor sites. The binding of [3H]SR 95531 to membranes also appeared to occur at low-affinity GABAA sites. Results from competition studies demonstrated that [3H]SR 95531 is displaceable by GABAA agents and displaced preferentially by GABAA antagonists. Scatchard analysis of saturation experiments from membrane preparations indicated that the KD and Bmax from the centrifugation assay was 53.0 nM and 4.26 pmol/mg protein, respectively. Using the filtration assay, binding to membranes yielded a KD value of 45.6 nM and a Bmax of 0.77 pmol/mg protein. The allosteric modulation data demonstrated that numerous benzodiazepine and barbiturate agents inhibited [3H]SR 95531 binding and this varied according to brain region. Several barbiturates included in the incubation media exhibited a stereoselective inhibition of [3H]SR 95531 binding to whole rat brain membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "60": "Mice were given flurazepam, 40 mg k-1, IP, once daily for 7 consecutive days. Twenty-four and forty-eight hours after the last injection measurements were made of the effects on convulsion threshold, body temperature and locomotor activity, of drugs acting on the GABA receptor complex. Significant decreases were seen in the hypothermic and hypomobility effects of progabide at 48 h, but no significant changes were seen in the effects of pentylenetetrazol or pentobarbitone. The actions of picrotoxin in all three types of test and the convulsant action of bicuculline (IP) were significantly decreased at 24 h but not at 48 h. The convulsive, but not the hypothermic, effects of picrotoxin were increased at the 48 h interval. These results may suggest that the chronic benzodiazepine treatment decreased some aspects of GABA receptor function at 48 h after the last dose; however, such an effect probably does not explain the previously reported increases in the effects of inverse agonists following chronic agonist treatment.", 
    "61": "1. Anxiety induced by forced swimming increases maximal intensity (h) of platelet aggregation (PAG) and time to reach it (t). 2. PK 11195 pretreatment (12.5 and 25 mg/kg) reverses anxiety-induced PAG changes. At 6.25 mg/kg it inhibits PAG. 3. Changes induced by anxiety on PAG may be mediated by peripheral-benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "62": "Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, blocks the central effects of benzodiazepines by competitive interaction at the receptor site. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies in healthy volunteers (110/study) were performed to determine the minimal effective dose of flumazenil required to reverse the sedative, psychomotor and amnesic effects of benzodiazepines used to produce conscious sedation. Conscious sedation was produced by i.v. diazepam (12-30 mg) in one study and i.v. lorazepam (0.045 mg kg-1) in the other. Intravenous flumazenil (0.001, 0.003, 0.007 or 0.014 mg kg-1) or placebo was administered after diazepam or lorazepam. Assessment of sedation, psychomotor performance and recall/recognition were made both before and after the benzodiazepine as well as serially after flumazenil or placebo. Doses as low as 0.007 and 0.014 mg kg-1 flumazenil consistently reversed diazepam- and lorazepam-induced effects, respectively. The duration of reversal produced by varying doses of flumazenil (0.2, 0.6, 1.0 or 3 mg) was evaluated in 50 volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. A constant level of conscious sedation was produced by a continuous infusion of midazolam. Assessments of sedation and psychomotor performance were assessed both before and at varying times after the administration of flumazenil or placebo. Preliminary results indicate that the duration of reversal produced by 3.0 mg flumazenil was longer than that produced by any of the lower doses. While the mean duration of reversal produced by the lower doses was comparable, the 0.2 mg dose resulted in the greatest between subject variability and only partial rather than complete reversal. Two further double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were done in healthy volunteers (45/study) to evaluate the safety of flumazenil 1.0 mg or placebo given i.v. to reverse midazolam-induced sedation in subjects who had been treated for up to 14 days with either oral diazepam or triazolam. No clinically significant changes were noted in laboratory test values, electrocardiograms or vital signs monitored for up to 36 h after flumazenil or placebo in any pre-treatment group.", 
    "63": "(1) Flumazenil is a highly specific benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist. It exerts its effect by competitive interaction at the BZ receptor site. (ii) Flumazenil antagonizes all central BZ effects irrespective of its contiguity to the BZ administration. (iii) The pharmacological effect of flumazenil depends upon the number of BZ receptors that can be occupied by flumazenil according to the mass-action law. Receptor occupancy is determined by the affinity of the BZ for the receptor and the free BZ concentration near the receptor. (iv) The minimal effective dose of flumazenil is 0.2 mg. After extreme BZ overdose 1 mg may be needed. (v) The optimal dosing strategy starts with an initial dose of flumazenil 0.2 mg i.v. The administration of further low doses of 0.1 mg at 1-min intervals allows the interruption of the injection of flumazenil exactly at the stage of vigilance that is most convenient for the patient. (vi) The duration of effect depends upon the type and dose of the administered BZ, the dose of flumazenil, and the time interval between flumazenil and the BZ administration. (vii) The therapeutic or safety index is above 3000, which means that a 3000 times overdose is still tolerated.", 
    "64": "The story of flumazenil is a typical example of a serendipitous preclinical drug discovery. Our search for specific benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) blockers in the early seventies, based on a hypothetical explanation of acute tolerance to diazepam, was unsuccessful. However, we discovered such compounds in 1979 in a programme aimed at more selective anxiolytics within a series of imidazobenzodiazepinones. Synthetic and pharmacological investigations of benzodiazepinones (BZ) are reviewed here. The discovery of flumazenil confirmed the mechanism of action of BZs through specific BZRs. It also demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining BZR ligands covering a broad spectrum of intrinsic efficacies, from full agonists, partial agonists, antagonists, partial inverse agonists to full inverse agonists.", 
    "65": "In Sweden the pattern of consumption of hypnotics has changed over the last two decades in favour of benzodiazepines (BZ), at the expense, mainly, of barbiturates. The agents chosen in cases of self-induced poisoning relfect this altered pattern of consumption. The frequency of BZ poisoning alone or in combinations at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of one of the largest hospitals in Stockholm increased by an average of 13% per year between 1972 and 1986. Today BZ poisoning constitutes 57% of all self-induced poisonings with hypnotics and sedatives. The mortality is negligible, but the cost of ICU treatment is substantial. The discovery of the BZ antidote flumazenil therefore opens up interesting diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. The drug's efficacy in reversing iatrogenic BZ overdose has been well documented. Its use in cases of self-induced poisoning has also been advocated. Various authors have reported independently successful use of flumazenil in series of patients admitted because of self-induced hypnotic-drug overdose. The results clearly demonstrate that flumazenil is a potent, quick-acting antidote to BZ. However, the duration of its action is short.", 
    "66": "Midazolam and alfentanil were infused in a totally i.v. anesthetic technique (TIVA) to patients undergoing hysterectomy. Correlations of midazolam plasma concentrations and effects were made during recovery. Due to the high doses of midazolam administered during TIVA, metabolism and not redistribution mainly governed the duration of effects post-infusion. The concomitant administration of alfentanil contributed to the sedative effect, as illustrated by a shift of the concentration-response curve to the left. As a result of these effects, recovery was prolonged and extended over 2-6 h. The effect of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil on post-operative performance after total i.v. anaesthesia with midazolam and alfentanil was studied. A bolus dose of flumazenil, 1.0 mg i.v., significantly improved recovery during the first post-operative hour but was followed later by resedation. The reduction in sedation followed by improvement in ventilation, without reduction of analgesia, demonstrated that antagonism of hypnosis is the primary factor in enhancing recovery from total i.v. anaesthesia.", 
    "67": "Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) is a ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) with high affinity, great specificity and minimal positive intrinsic efficacy, which reaches its sites of action within the CNS very rapidly after i.v. and oral administration and which prevents and reverses dose-dependently all effects that BZR agonists and inverse agonists produce via the BZR. General aspects of the competitive interaction between flumazenil and BZR agonists are illustrated here. Flumazenil has slight partial agonistic properties that can be seen as a built-in safety mechanism when used in reversing agonist effects and that may be of use in the treatment of epilepsies.", 
    "68": "In two double-blind, randomized trials the efficacy and safety of flumazenil, the first benzodiazepine antagonist, were assessed in 100 adult patients undergoing gastroscopy under diazepam or midazolam sedation. The criteria of efficacy were the degree of sedation and anterograde amnesia. The median gastroscopy time was 20 min (range 5-40 min). The diazepam group received median 30 mg (range 15-60 mg) Diazemuls and the midazolam group median 15 mg (range 10-40 mg) Dormicum. Both groups were antagonized by median 0.42 mg flumazenil (range 0.4-0.6 mg). There was no inter-group difference with regard to blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate. There was a significantly faster recovery of the patients after injection of flumazenil than after placebo. Patients were awake shortly after flumazenil, but remained drowsy or asleep after placebo administration. All patients, regardless of diazepam or midazolam sedation, antagonized with flumazenil were awake within 5 min and remained awake during the whole observation period of 3 h. The amnesia was totally eliminated by flumazenil. There were no significant differences in side-effects between the groups."
