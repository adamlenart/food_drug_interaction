    "2": "We prospectively studied the effect on BMI of initiating or switching antipsychotic medication after 6 months of treatment among 3801 patients with schizophrenia in a real-life setting. Patients who were being treated with clozapine or olanzapine at baseline were more likely to experience a decrease in BMI during the follow-up period than the patients who were being treated with a conventional antipsychotic (odds ratio, 2.25 and 1.68, respectively). Patients treated with aripiprazole and, to a lesser extent, those treated with risperidone were more likely to experience a decrease in BMI during follow-up than patients treated with conventional antipsychotics (odds ratio, 2.96 and 2.06, respectively).",

Little is known on the combined effects of different categories of such drugs. The redeeming of prescriptions for CNS-active drugs during the second or third trimester of pregnancy was studied by linkage between a register of prescribed drugs and the Swedish Medical Birth Register for the deliveries during 2006-2008 (n = 15,045 live-born infants). Neonatal morbidity was defined as the presence of neonatal diagnoses of respiratory problems, hypoglycemia, convulsions, or other CNS pathologic abnormalities including intraventricular hemorrhage, or low 5-minute Apgar score. The risk of such neonatal morbidity after maternal use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) with or without other CNS-active drugs were evaluated as odds ratios or risk ratios, comparing with unexposed infants or infants only exposed to SSRI drugs. An increased risk for neonatal morbidity was seen for most studied groups of CNS-active drugs when used alone. Benzodiazepines seemed to have a stronger effect than other sedatives/hypnotics. The combination of SSRIs with 1 or more other CNS-active drug groups increased the risk for neonatal morbidity. This was seen for all types of sedatives/hypnotics, which may suggest a confounding by indication. Polypharmacy with CNS-active drugs during the later part of the pregnancy seems to increase the occurrence of neonatal morbidity but difference in nature or strength of underlying psychiatric pathology may confound the findings.",

In addition, there were significant between-group differences in change scores on fasting plasma glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment 2-insulin resistance, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and triglycerides (p < 0.001); all the changes were clinically in favor of ziprasidone treatment. Both medications were effective in improving schizophrenia symptoms, but the decreases in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores of the olanzapine group were significantly greater than that of the ziprasidone group (p < 0.05). Compared with olanzapine, ziprasidone also induced more prolonging of corrected QT interval and extrapyramidal side effects (p < 0.05).

    "17": "Emerging wastewater treatment processes such as membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have attracted a significant amount of interest internationally due to their ability to produce high quality effluent suitable for water recycling. It is therefore important that their efficiency in removing hazardous trace organic contaminants be assessed. Accordingly, this study investigated the removal of trace organic chemical contaminants through a full-scale, package MBR in New South Wales, Australia. This study was unique in the context of MBR research because it characterised the removal of 48 trace organic chemical contaminants, which included steroidal hormones, xenoestrogens, pesticides, caffeine, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). Results showed that the removal of most trace organic chemical contaminants through the MBR was high (above 90%). However, amitriptyline, carbamazepine, diazepam, diclofenac, fluoxetine, gemfibrozil, omeprazole, sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim were only partially removed through the MBR with the removal efficiencies of 24-68%. These are potential indicators for assessing MBR performance as these chemicals are usually sensitive to changes in the treatment systems. The trace organic chemical contaminants detected in the MBR permeate were 1 to 6 orders of magnitude lower than guideline values reported in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling. The outcomes of this study enhanced our understanding of the levels and removal of trace organic contaminants by MBRs.",

The entire sample was divided into two subgroups listing oxycodone as the primary/contributory cause of death (n=117) or oxycodone as the incidental cause of death (n=38). Differences between the two groups in demographic and clinical history variables as well as the presence and concentration of drugs were examined.", 
    "20": "The majority of decedents within the entire sample (N=155) were Caucasian males (58.1%) aged 50 or older. More than half of the population (52.9%) did not hold prescriptions for oxycodone. Those who died with a primary/contributory cause of death were younger, more likely to have a history of substance abuse, and more likely to have alprazalom (Xanax) present in their system. Across the entire sample, the mean oxycodone concentration level was 0.40 mg/L, with a range from 0.02 to 3.70 mg/L. Those who died with a primary/contributory cause of death had a significantly higher level of mean oxycodone concentration than those with an incidental cause of death, 0.48 mg/L compared to 0.16 mg/L.", 
    "21": "Results suggest that the demographic findings mirror statewide and national trends. In general, mean oxycodone concentration levels were shown to be lower than those previously reported in literature. Overlap and range of concentrations between those with a primary/contributory and incidental cause of death demonstrates the significance of individual case history and tolerance in the interpretation of postmortem drug concentrations when determining cause and manner of death.",

    "27": "Predicted metabolic drug clearances (CLPT ) were determined using in vitro-in vivo extrapolation coupled with physiological-based pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation (IVIVE-PBPK) in Simcyp\u00ae. Simulations were conducted using CYP-selective 'probe' drugs with subjects in 5 year age groups (20-25 to 90-95 years). CLPT values were compared with human pharmacokinetic data stratified according to age (young = 20-40 years and elderly = 65-85 years) and gender. Age-related changes in the physiological parameters used for IVIVE of CLPT were described.", 
    "28": "Predicted metabolic drug clearances decreased with increasing adult age to approximately 65-70 years: caffeine from 1.5 to 1.0\u2009ml\u2009min(-1) \u2009kg(-1) (a 33% decrease), S-warfarin from 0.100 to 0.064\u2009ml\u2009min(-1) \u2009kg(-1) (36%), S-mephenytoin from 4.1 to 2.5\u2009ml\u2009min(-1) \u2009kg(-1) (39%), desipramine from 10.6 to 7.3\u2009ml\u2009min(-1) \u2009kg(-1) (31%) and midazolam from 5.4 to 3.9\u2009ml\u2009min(-1) \u2009kg(-1) (27%). Except for S-mephenytoin, predictions were within 3.5-fold of clearances from clinical studies when stratified by age and gender. A trend towards higher CLPT was observed in females, but this was only statistically significant in larger virtual trials. Physiological parameters that determine CLPT decreased with increasing adult age: mean microsomal protein\u2009g(-1) of liver, liver weight, hepatic blood flow and human serum albumin concentration.", 
    "29": "Decreased metabolic clearance in the elderly was predicted by Simcyp\u00ae and was generally consistent with limited clinical data for four out of five drugs studied and the broader literature for drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes.

The synthetic cannabinomimetics identified were JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-122, JWH-250, and 1-pentyl-3-(4-methoxybenzoyl)indol. A compound not previously reported in such designer drug preparations 1-butyl-3-(4-methoxybenzoyl)indol was also seen. There was a marked variation in the content of these compounds within a named brand. The pharmaceutical benzodiazepine phenazepam (fenazepam) was identified as a constituent, along with certain cannabinominetics, in nearly all of the Kronic samples examined. Phenazepam has not previously been reported as a constituent of designer drug or herbal high products. The amount of phenazepam was approximately 1\u2009mg per gram of Kronic leaf material.

All autopsy reports regarding homicides from the period January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2008, were retrospectively reviewed. Five hundred eleven homicide cases were selected of 4842 autopsy cases. The following data were recorded: assailants and victims characteristics, crime scene location, homicide motive, cause of death, and victim's postmortem toxicological results. Homicide rate steadily declined over the period at the exception of the number of homicide-suicide per year, which remained constant. Homicide victims remained unidentified after medicolegal investigations in 2% of the cases. Child and elder homicide cases represented, respectively, 10.7% and 8.2% of the cases. Offenders were male in 88% of the cases. Male and female assailants showed distinct homicide patterns: females were involved more frequently in familial quarrel and child abuse. They never killed a stranger and committed homicide exclusively in a private place with a predominance of sharp weapons. Males, in contrast, assaulted almost equally a stranger or an acquaintance, often in a public place with a predominance of firearm. Victim knew the assailant(s) in 57% of the cases. Homicides mostly took place at the residence of the assailant or the victim. Homicide motive was clearly determined in 71% of the cases. Argument was the most common motive in 44% of the cases. Sexual assault was rarely found (10 cases). Gunshot wounds were the most common cause of death (37%), followed by stab wounds (27%), blunt trauma (19%), and asphyxia (13%). A decrease of gunshot wounds as a cause of death was found over the studied period. Alcohol was the most common toxic detected in blood of the victim, in 48.5% of the cases when toxicological results were available. Blood alcohol concentration ranged from 1 to 500 mg/dL with a mean value of 150 mg/dL.",

The maximum enhancement of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding in short-term zolpidem treated group was not significantly different from that in the control group. In contrast, long-term exposure to zolpidem resulted in significantly increase in the maximum number of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding sites without changing the affinity. Furthermore, long-term exposure to zolpidem significantly decreased the ability of GABA to stimulate [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding.",

    "37": "Accumulated evidence indicates that metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor blockade exerts antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like effects in several animal models. The novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test is used to measure anxiety-induced hypophagia in rodents. Anxiogenic-like behavior can be counteracted by acute treatment with anxiolytics or chronic treatment with antidepressants. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of an mGlu5 receptor antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), using the NSF test and to investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of MPEP. The administration of MPEP at 1 h prior to testing significantly shortened the latency period until feed (an acute effect), and this effect lasted for 24 h (a sustained effect), similar to the results observed using the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine. Pretreatment with a protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin, blocked the sustained, but not the acute, effects of MPEP, suggesting the involvement of new protein synthesis in the sustained effect of MPEP. In addition, the sustained effect of MPEP in the NSF test was partially abolished by pretreatment with a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) antagonist, rapamycin. In contrast, a tropomyosin-related kinase, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a, did not counteract the sustained effects of MPEP in this test. Taken together, these results are the first report to demonstrate that the blockade of the mGlu5 receptor exerted acute and sustained effects in the NSF test and that new protein synthesis may contribute to the sustained effects of MPEP, which may not mediate brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mTOR signaling.", 
    "38": "GABA(A) receptors have important physiological functions, as revealed by pharmacological studies and experiments involving gene-targeted mouse models, and are the target of widely used drugs such as the benzodiazepines. In this review, we are summarizing current knowledge about the function of \u03b12-containing GABA(A) receptors, a receptor subtype representing approximately 15-20% of all GABA(A) receptors. This receptor subtype mediates anxiolytic-like, reward-enhancing, and antihyperalgesic actions of diazepam, and has antidepressant-like properties. Secondary insufficiency of \u03b12-containing GABA(A) receptors has been postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and may be involved in cognitive impairment in other disorders. Moreover, polymorphisms in the GABRA2 gene encoding the GABA(A) receptor \u03b12 subunit have been found to be linked to chronic alcohol dependence and to polydrug abuse. Thus, \u03b12-containing GABA(A) receptors are involved in the regulation and/or modulation of emotional behaviors and of chronic pain, and appear to be a valid target for novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and chronic pain.",

Dizocilpine impaired OST performance at a dose (0.1 mg/kg) that did not affect SD, and that impairment depended on memory load. Chlordiazepoxide (3.0 mg/kg) also produced amnestic effects that were manifest by shorter memory spans and runs of correct responding. In contrast, morphine and scopolamine impaired OST accuracy only at doses that also disrupted SD (18.0 and 0.3 mg/kg, respectively).",

Thus, they can not adequately account for noncovalent interactions involving halogen atoms like halogen bonds or halogen-\u03c0 interactions. These deficiencies in the underlying force fields result from the lack of treatment of the anisotropy of the electron density distribution of those atoms, known as the \"\u03c3-hole\", although recent developments have begun to take specific interactions such as halogen bonding into account. We have now replaced classical force field derived molecular fields by local properties such as the local ionization energy, local electron affinity, or local polarizability, calculated using quantum-mechanical (QM) techniques that do not suffer from the above limitation for 3D-QSAR. We first investigate the characteristics of QM-based local property fields to show that they are suitable for statistical analyses after suitable pretreatment. We then analyze these property fields with partial least-squares (PLS) regression to predict biological affinities of two data sets comprising factor Xa and GABA-A/benzodiazepine receptor ligands. While the resulting models perform equally well or even slightly better in terms of consistency and predictivity than the classical CoMFA fields, the most important aspect of these augmented field-types is that the chemical interpretation of resulting QM-based property field models reveals unique SAR trends driven by electrostatic and polarizability effects, which cannot be extracted directly from CoMFA electrostatic maps. Within the factor Xa set, the interaction of chlorine and bromine atoms with a tyrosine side chain in the protease S1 pocket are correctly predicted. Within the GABA-A/benzodiazepine ligand data set, PLS models of high predictivity resulted for our QM-based property fields, providing novel insights into key features of the SAR for two receptor subtypes and cross-receptor selectivity of the ligands. The detailed interpretation of regression models derived using improved QM-derived property fields thus provides a significant advantage by revealing chemically meaningful correlations with biological activity and helps in understanding novel structure-activity relationship features. This will allow such knowledge to be used to design novel molecules on the basis of interactions additional to steric and hydrogen-bonding features.", 
    "59": "Today, there are many pharmacotherapeutic options for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The question is, which is the best medication for a particular patient at a particular moment? This is especially challenging because GAD is by definition a chronic disorder and new interventions should learn from earlier experiences. An algorithm which can help to use pretreatment information for drug selection is the \"Pretreatment - Next Treatment (PN) - Algorithm\". This article introduces an PN-algorithm for GAD.", 
    "60": "For the development of a GAD-specific PN-algorithm, all possible pharmacological options for GAD are reviewed and brought into a rank order on the basis of scientific evidence regarding efficacy, tolerability, or price: (1) pregabalin, (2) venlafaxine XR, (3) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (4) tricyclic antidepressants, (5) buspirone, (6) antipsychotics, (7) benzodiazepines, and (8) hydroxyzine. Based on this hierarchy and patient-specific information, a decision algorithm is derived, which allows to assess and evaluate pretreatment and to select the drug with no contraindications, limited negative or convincing positive effects, or the option which has not been used so far but which is the next compound in the hierarchy.",

    "62": "We describe a negative feedback autocrine regulatory circuit for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in purified human islets in vitro. Using chronoamperometry and in vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion measurements, evidence is provided that dopamine (DA), which is loaded into insulin-containing secretory granules by vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 in human \u03b2-cells, is released in response to glucose stimulation. DA then acts as a negative regulator of insulin secretion via its action on D2R, which are also expressed on \u03b2-cells. We found that antagonism of receptors participating in islet DA signaling generally drive increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These in vitro observations may represent correlates of the in vivo metabolic changes associated with the use of atypical antipsychotics, such as increased adiposity.",

Approximately one third (34.8%) occurred under VPA monotherapy, while the majority was seen with VPA plus co-medication, most frequently antiepileptics (34.8%) and benzodiazepines (16.7%). A subgroup of 34 cases (25.8%) had a fatal outcome, the largest number reported to date. Of these, 32.4% were under VPA monotherapy and 67.6% under VPA plus concomitant medication. Within the study period a significant increase in the total number of reported cases and the subgroup of fatal cases was found.This first pharmacovigilance study of VPA-associated liver failure indicates a higher rate of non-fatal and fatal liver failure when VPA is given with co-medication as compared to monotherapy. However, co-medication per se does not increase the risk of fatalities.",

    "65": "Several Danish national registries were linked to identify individuals whose spouses had a fatal or non-fatal AMI. Married patients with fatal or non-fatal AMI (1997-2008) were matched with their counterparts dying or hospitalized with a non-AMI cause; incident use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines, incident depression care, and suicides were compared pre- and post-event using Poisson models. Overall, 16 506 spouses of individuals dying of AMI were matched with 49 518 spouses of individuals dying of a non-AMI cause. Similarly, 44 566 spouses of individuals with a non-fatal AMI were matched with 131 563 spouses of individuals with a non-fatal, non-AMI hospitalization. Those whose spouse died of AMI (compared with a non-AMI cause) had increased antidepressant and benzodiazepine use [peak incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.7 vs. 3.3, and 46.4 vs. 13.0, respectively; P< 0.001]. Those whose spouse had a non-fatal AMI (compared with a non-AMI hospitalization) had increased risk for antidepressant and benzodiazepine initiation (IRR 1.5 vs. 1.1, and 6.7 vs. 1.3, respectively, P< 0.001). Spouses of fatal AMI patients also had an increased risk of depression and suicide. Male individuals whose spouse had a fatal or non-fatal AMI had a relatively higher increased risk of depression than female individuals.",

    "67": "Rats with chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis by infusion of l-allyglycine, a glutamic acid decarboxylase inhibitor, into their dorsomedial/perifornical hypothalamus are anxious and exhibit panic-like cardio-respiratory responses to treatment with intravenous (i.v.) sodium lactate (NaLac) infusions, in a manner similar to what occurs in patients with panic disorder. We previously showed that either NMDA receptor antagonists or metabotropic glutamate receptor type 2/3 receptor agonists can block such a NaLac response, suggesting that a glutamate mechanism is contributing to this panic-like state. Using this animal model of panic, we tested the efficacy of CBiPES and THIIC, which are selective group II metabotropic glutamate type 2 receptor allosteric potentiators (at 10-30 mg/kg i.p.), in preventing NaLac-induced panic-like behavioral and cardiovascular responses. The positive control was alprazolam (3mg/kg i.p.), a clinically effective anti-panic benzodiazepine. As predicted, panic-prone rats given a NaLac challenge displayed NaLac-induced panic-like cardiovascular (i.e. tachycardia and hypertensive) responses and \"anxiety\" (i.e. decreased social interaction time) and \"flight\" (i.e. increased locomotion) -associated behaviors; however, systemic injection of the panic-prone rats with CBiPES, THIIC or alprazolam prior to the NaLac dose blocked all NaLac-induced panic-like behaviors and cardiovascular responses. These data suggested that in a rat animal model, selective group II metabotropic glutamate type 2 receptor allosteric potentiators show an anti-panic efficacy similar to alprazolam.", 
    "68": "To account for benzodiazepine-induced spinal analgesia observed in association with an inflammation-induced shift in the influence of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine on nociceptive threshold, the present study was designed to determine whether persistent inflammation is associated with the upregulation of high-affinity GABA(A) receptors in primary afferents. The cell bodies of afferents innervating the glabrous skin of the rat hind paw were retrogradely labeled, acutely dissociated, and studied before and after the induction of persistent inflammation. A time-dependent increase in GABA(A) current density was observed that was more than twofold by 72 h after the initiation of inflammation. This increase in current density included both high- and low-affinity currents and was restricted to neurons in which GABA increased intracellular Ca(2+). No increases in GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA or protein were detected in whole ganglia. In contrast, the increased current density was completely reversed by 20-min preincubation with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein and partially reversed with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2. Genistein reversal was partially blocked by the dynamin inhibitor peptide P4. Changes in nociceptive threshold following spinal administration of genistein and muscimol to inflamed rats indicated that the pronociceptive actions of muscimol observed in the presence of inflammation were reversed by genistein. These results suggest that persistent changes in relative levels of tyrosine kinase activity following inflammation provide not only a sensitive way to dynamically regulate spinal nociceptive signaling but a viable target for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for the treatment of inflammatory pain.",

Simultaneous treatment with both is usually avoided. Here, we report a case of the use of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil before ECT to facilitate the simultaneous use of lorazepam and ECT for the treatment of co-occurring catatonia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Both catatonia and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms improved in the patient. Physicians should be aware of flumazenil as a clinical tool for use in treatment-resistant cases.",

After trials with antiviral medications, benzodiazepines, and atypical antipsychotic medications, she was treated with 6 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy with complete recovery and no complications. Catatonia arising in the background of organic pathology can be treated on similar lines as in other psychiatric disorders.

    "72": "Haploinsufficiency of the SCN1A gene encoding voltage-gated sodium channel Na(V)1.1 causes Dravet's syndrome, a childhood neuropsychiatric disorder including recurrent intractable seizures, cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours. The neural mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours in Dravet's syndrome are poorly understood. Here we report that mice with Scn1a haploinsufficiency exhibit hyperactivity, stereotyped behaviours, social interaction deficits and impaired context-dependent spatial memory. Olfactory sensitivity is retained, but novel food odours and social odours are aversive to Scn1a(+/-) mice. GABAergic neurotransmission is specifically impaired by this mutation, and selective deletion of Na(V)1.1 channels in forebrain interneurons is sufficient to cause these behavioural and cognitive impairments. Remarkably, treatment with low-dose clonazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors, completely rescued the abnormal social behaviours and deficits in fear memory in the mouse model of Dravet's syndrome, demonstrating that they are caused by impaired GABAergic neurotransmission and not by neuronal damage from recurrent seizures. These results demonstrate a critical role for Na(V)1.1 channels in neuropsychiatric functions and provide a potential therapeutic strategy for cognitive deficit and autism-spectrum behaviours in Dravet's syndrome.",

The hippocampus is a crucial brain area involved in the neural circuits of the pathophysiology of anxiety and stress-related disorders, and GABA is one of most important neurotransmitters related to these disorders. An anxiogenic drug and a pharmacological stressor, FG7142 (N-methyl-\u00df-carboline-3-carboxamide), produces anxiety in humans and experimental animals, acting at the benzodiazepine sites of the GABAA receptors as a partial inverse agonist. This drug as well as immobilization stress produced an increased mRNA in a number of genes, e.g., Btg2 and Adamsts1, in the cortex of rodents. The present study was carried out to clarify the effect of the anxiogenic drug on the gene expressions in the hippocampus and to obtain a new insight into the GABAergic system involved in the pathophysiology of the disorders.",

Chronic zolpidem treatment resulted in tolerance to diazepam's hypothermic effect, but partial anxiolytic tolerance and no sedative tolerance. Chronic TPA023 treatment did not result in tolerance to diazepam's hypothermic, anxiolytic or sedative effects.", 
    "86": "OUR DATA INDICATE THAT: (i) GABA(A)-\u03b1(2)/\u03b1(3) subtype selective drugs might not induce tolerance; (ii) in rodents quantitative and temporal variations in tolerance development occur dependent on the endpoint assessed, consistent with clinical experience with benzodiazepines (e.g., differential tolerance to antiepileptic and anxiolytic actions); (iii) tolerance to diazepam's sedative actions needs concomitant activation of GABA(A)-\u03b1(1)/GABA(A)-\u03b1(5) receptors. Regarding mechanism, in-situ hybridization studies indicated no gross changes in expression levels of GABA(A) \u03b1(1), \u03b1(2) or \u03b1(5) subunit mRNA in hippocampus or cortex.

    "87": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a common cause of adverse drug events. In this paper, we combined a literature discovery approach with analysis of a large electronic medical record database method to predict and evaluate novel DDIs. We predicted an initial set of 13197 potential DDIs based on substrates and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolism enzymes identified from published in vitro pharmacology experiments. Using a clinical repository of over 800,000 patients, we narrowed this theoretical set of DDIs to 3670 drug pairs actually taken by patients. Finally, we sought to identify novel combinations that synergistically increased the risk of myopathy. Five pairs were identified with their p-values less than 1E-06: loratadine and simvastatin (relative risk or RR\u200a=\u200a1.69); loratadine and alprazolam (RR\u200a=\u200a1.86); loratadine and duloxetine (RR\u200a=\u200a1.94); loratadine and ropinirole (RR\u200a=\u200a3.21); and promethazine and tegaserod (RR\u200a=\u200a3.00). When taken together, each drug pair showed a significantly increased risk of myopathy when compared to the expected additive myopathy risk from taking either of the drugs alone. Based on additional literature data on in vitro drug metabolism and inhibition potency, loratadine and simvastatin and tegaserod and promethazine were predicted to have a strong DDI through the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes, respectively. This new translational biomedical informatics approach supports not only detection of new clinically significant DDI signals, but also evaluation of their potential molecular mechanisms.", 
    "88": "The increase in cytochrome P450 (P450) enzyme activity noted upon exposure to therapeutics can elicit marked drug-drug interactions (DDIs) that may ultimately result in poor clinical outcome or adverse drug effects. As such, in vitro model systems that can rapidly and accurately determine whether potential therapeutics activate the human pregnane X receptor (PXR) and thus induce CYP3A P450 levels are highly sought after tools for drug discovery. To that end, we assessed whether DPX2 cells, a HepG2-derived cell line stably integrated with a PXR expression vector plus a luciferase reporter, could detect agents that not only cause PXR activation/CYP3A induction but also elicit clinical DDIs. All 20 clinical inducers and 9 of 15 clinical noninducers examined activated PXR in DPX2 cells (E(max) > 8-fold), although activation parameters obtained with the noninducers were not predictive of DDI. The relative induction score, calculated by combining PXR activation parameters (EC(50) and E(max)) in DPX2 cells for seven inducers plus four noninducers with their efficacious total plasma concentrations, strongly correlated (R(2) = 0.90) with the magnitude of induction of midazolam clearance. Thus, the DPX cell-based PXR activation system is not only capable of distinguishing potential inducers in a high-throughput manner but can also differentiate among compounds in predicting the magnitude of induction-mediated DDIs, providing a means for structure-activity relationship screening during discovery and development.", 
    "89": "Bromodomain-containing proteins bind acetylated lysine residues on histone tails and are involved in the recruitment of additional factors that mediate histone modifications and enable transcription. A compound, I-BET-762, that inhibits binding of an acetylated histone peptide to proteins of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family, was previously shown to suppress the production of proinflammatory proteins by macrophages and block acute inflammation in mice. Here, we investigated the effect of short-term treatment with I-BET-762 on T-cell function. Treatment of na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells with I-BET-762 during the first 2 d of differentiation had long-lasting effects on subsequent gene expression and cytokine production. Gene expression analysis revealed up-regulated expression of several antiinflammatory gene products, including IL-10, Lag3, and Egr2, and down-regulated expression of several proinflammatory cytokines including GM-CSF and IL-17. The short 2-d treatment with I-BET-762 inhibited the ability of antigen-specific T cells, differentiated under Th1 but not Th17 conditions in vitro, to induce pathogenesis in an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The suppressive effects of I-BET-762 on T-cell mediated inflammation in vivo were accompanied by decreased recruitment of macrophages, consistent with decreased GM-CSF production by CNS-infiltrating T cells. These effects were mimicked by an inhibitor of c-myc function, implicating reduced expression of c-myc and GM-CSF as one avenue by which I-BET-762 suppresses the inflammatory functions of T cells. Our study demonstrates that inhibiting the functions of BET-family proteins during early T-cell differentiation causes long-lasting suppression of the proinflammatory functions of Th1 cells.", 
    "90": "Core binding factor (CBF) leukemias, those with translocations or inversions that affect transcription factor genes RUNX1 or CBFB, account for ~24% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 25% of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Current treatments for CBF leukemias are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with a 5-y survival rate of ~50%. We hypothesize that the interaction between RUNX1 and CBF\u03b2 is critical for CBF leukemia and can be targeted for drug development. We developed high-throughput AlphaScreen and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) methods to quantify the RUNX1-CBF\u03b2 interaction and screen a library collection of 243,398 compounds. Ro5-3335, a benzodiazepine identified from the screen, was able to interact with RUNX1 and CBF\u03b2 directly, repress RUNX1/CBFB-dependent transactivation in reporter assays, and repress runx1-dependent hematopoiesis in zebrafish embryos. Ro5-3335 preferentially killed human CBF leukemia cell lines, rescued preleukemic phenotype in a RUNX1-ETO transgenic zebrafish, and reduced leukemia burden in a mouse CBFB-MYH11 leukemia model. Our data thus confirmed that RUNX1-CBF\u03b2 interaction can be targeted for leukemia treatment and we have identified a promising lead compound for this purpose.", 
    "91": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs such as Olanzapine induce weight gain and metabolic changes associated with the development of type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms underlying the metabolic side-effects of these centrally acting drugs are still unknown to a large extent. We compared the effects of peripheral (intragastric; 3 mg/kg/h) versus central (intracerebroventricular; 30 \u00b5g/kg/h) administration of Olanzapine on glucose metabolism using the stable isotope dilution technique (Experiment 1) in combination with low and high hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (Experiments 2 and 3), in order to evaluate hepatic and extra-hepatic insulin sensitivity, in adult male Wistar rats. Blood glucose, plasma corticosterone and insulin levels were measured alongside endogenous glucose production and glucose disappearance. Livers were harvested to determine glycogen content. Under basal conditions peripheral administration of Olanzapine induced pronounced hyperglycemia without a significant increase in hepatic glucose production (Experiment 1). The clamp experiments revealed a clear insulin resistance both at hepatic (Experiment 2) and extra-hepatic levels (Experiment 3). The induction of insulin resistance in Experiments 2 and 3 was supported by decreased hepatic glycogen stores in Olanzapine-treated rats. Central administration of Olanzapine, however, did not result in any significant changes in blood glucose, plasma insulin or corticosterone concentrations nor in glucose production. In conclusion, acute intragastric administration of Olanzapine leads to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in male rats. The metabolic side-effects of Olanzapine appear to be mediated primarily via a peripheral mechanism, and not to have a central origin.", 
    "92": "Consumption of deoxynivalenol (DON), a trichothecene mycotoxin known to commonly contaminate grain-based foods, suppresses growth of experimental animals, thus raising concerns over its potential to adversely affect young children. Although this growth impairment is believed to result from anorexia, the initiating mechanisms for appetite suppression remain unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that DON induces the release of satiety hormones and that this response corresponds to the toxin's anorectic action. Acute ip exposure to DON had no effect on plasma glucagon-like peptide-1, leptin, amylin, pancreatic polypeptide, gastric inhibitory peptide, or ghrelin; however, the toxin was found to robustly elevate peptide YY (PYY) and cholecystokinin (CCK). Specifically, ip exposure to DON at 1 and 5mg/kg bw induced PYY by up to 2.5-fold and CCK by up to 4.1-fold. These responses peaked within 15-120 min and lasted up to 120 min (CCK) and 240 min (PPY), corresponding with depressed rates of food intake. Direct administration of exogenous PYY or CCK similarly caused reduced food intake. Food intake experiments using the NPY2 receptor antagonist BIIE0246 and the CCK1A receptor antagonist devazepide, individually, suggested that PYY mediated DON-induced anorexia but CCK did not. Orolingual exposure to DON induced plasma PYY and CCK elevation and anorexia comparable with that observed for ip exposure. Taken together, these findings suggest that PYY might be one critical mediator of DON-induced anorexia and, ultimately, growth suppression.", 
    "93": "Pharmacological effects of hydroalcoholic extract prepared from Hypericum origanifolium Willd. (Guttiferae) on behavioral parameters and pain perceptions of mice were investigated in this study. Depression, anxiety, spontaneous locomotor activity, and motor coordination parameters of mice were assessed by modified forced swimming, hole board, activity cage, and rota-rod tests, respectively. In addition, antinociceptive effect was evaluated by performing hot-plate, tail-clip, and formalin tests. Reboxetine (20 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg), and morphine (10 mg/kg) were used as reference antidepressant, anxiolytic, and analgesic drugs, respectively. Phytochemical analyses exhibited that chlorogenic acid (2317.12 ppm) and rutin (2108.79 ppm) were the main phenolic compounds in the H.\u2009origanifolium extract. The extract (50, 100, and 250 mg/kg) induced significant antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antinociceptive activities following the acute administrations. Anxiolytic effect was antagonized by flumazenil (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, 2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) pre-treatment, which indicated the participation of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the activity. Moreover, centrally and peripherally mediated antinociception reversed by naloxone (a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, 5 mg/kg, i.p.) pre-treatment, indicating the involvement of opioid system in the pharmacological action. These findings are the first to indicate the pharmacological effects of the H. origanifolium extract on the emotional state and pain perceptions of mice.", 
    "94": "Alcohol dependence is caused by complex interactions of multiple susceptibility genes with little effect each and environmental factors. Candidate genes influence metabolism of alcohol, such as alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, and modulatory transmitter systems, such as the dopaminergic, serotonergic, acetylcholinergic, gamma-aminobutyric acidergic, and various neuropeptidergic systems. Dysfunctional behavioral choices, learning, and memory are involved in the etiology of alcohol dependence. Systematic promotion and maintenance of motivation is a lifetime challenge in the treatment of alcohol use disorders. The second step of treatment management is the discontinuation of alcohol consumption. Withdrawal symptoms can be treated with gamma-aminobutyric acidergic substances such as benzodiazepines. Long-term relapse prevention is another challenge. Multimodal treatment can include naltrexone, a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, or acamprosate, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulator, which are first line for pharmacological treatment on the basis of recent Cochrane analyses. Due to the complexity of etiology with both psychological and neurobiological factors, future treatment management of alcoholism may include the combination of individualized disorder-specific psychotherapy and drugs acting on different neuronal pathways, on the basis of individual vulnerability. However, the question remains unsolved whether an individualized approach is feasible and how subgroups should be defined.", 
    "95": "Patients with schizophrenia often have anxiety and depression, and thus are treated with multiple psychotherapeutic medications. This practice of polypharmacy increases the possibility for drug-drug interactions. However, the pharmacological and behavioral mechanisms underlying drug-drug interactions in schizophrenia remain poorly understood. In the present study, we adopted a preclinical approach and examined a less known behavioral mechanism, drug-drug conditioning (DDC) between haloperidol (a typical antipsychotic) or olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic) and citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). A rat two-way conditioned avoidance response paradigm was used to measure antipsychotic activity and determine how DDC may alter the antipsychotic efficacy in this model. Following acquisition of the avoidance response, rats were then randomly assigned to receive vehicle, citalopram (10.0 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg, subcutaneously), olanzapine (1.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously), combined haloperidol with citalopram, or combined olanzapine with citalopram treatment for seven avoidance test sessions. In comparison with antipsychotic treatment alone, combined treatment with citalopram potentiated the antiavoidance effect of olanzapine or haloperidol (to a lesser extent) during the seven drug-test sessions. In addition, repeated pairing of citalopram with haloperidol or olanzapine caused citalopram to show a newly acquired avoidance-disruptive effect. This effect was context specific because citalopram paired with haloperidol or olanzapine outside the avoidance testing context (i.e. home cages) did not show such an effect. These findings indicate that concurrent antidepressant and antipsychotic treatments may engender a DDC process that follows the general Pavlovian associative conditioning principles. They also indicate that adjunctive citalopram treatment may enhance the antipsychotic efficacy of haloperidol and olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia.", 
    "96": "Stretchability is one of the most important functional properties of Mozzarella cheese, but no objective and widely accepted technique exists for evaluation; most of the cheese stretchability tests are influenced by the ambient conditions. This paper demonstrates a technique, which is novel and relatively simple, to evaluate the stretchability of Mozzarella cheese objectively. In an oil bath, melted cheese is stretched by a hook probe, controlled by an Instron tensile tester (Instron Corp., Norwood, MA); cheese strands are lifted from the melted cheese reservoir to a stretch length of 300 mm, when the load and extension data are recorded by the Instron tensile tester. This test overcomes other tests' drawbacks, such as subjective stretching speeds and variations in ambient temperature and humidity. Through the test comparison on standard Mozzarella, the modified stretching test in an oil bath has greater repeatability than the original test without oil bath. From the load and extension curve, the yield load is measured to evaluate the stretchability. In the meantime, the inversion point extension of necking is also measured based on polymer study, producing more repeatable results than the yield load. The modified 3-prong hook test was applied to Mozzarella cheese samples with different processing conditions, including the screw conditions (screw time, speed, and temperature), draining pH, calcium content, and fat content, and significant differences were found between these samples and the control sample.",

For olanzapine-treated patients, risk factors included smoking status, previous episode history, amount of time patients had a 21-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-21) score \u2264 8 at pre-randomization, and HDRS-21 score at randomization. For lithium-treated patients, no mediators/moderators were identified among relapse variables. For olanzapine-treated patients, several baseline variables--such as previous number of mood episodes (manic or depressive)--operate through severity of depressive symptoms prior to remission (mediator) to affect relapse rate. On the other hand, the effect of the patient's pre-remission depressive symptoms on outcome is moderated by the polarity of the first episode, whether manic, depressive, or mixed.",

    "101": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that causes disability due to inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. Pain is a common symptom in patients with MS but is often inadequately treated, leading to decreased functioning and a low quality of life. Pain associated with MS includes central neuropathic pain due to lesions of the somatosensory system, and nociceptive pain due to spasticity, muscle tightness or contracture, abnormal gait and postures caused by MS, or treatment-related pain. Patient education, physical therapy, and pharmacotherapy can all be helpful in treating the painful symptoms of MS. Tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and opioids are first-line options for central neuropathic pain, and spasmolytics, muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsants are helpful for nociceptive pain. Pain should be regularly assessed and appropriately treated to improve functioning and quality of life for patients with MS.",

In other words, older age, smoking, tremor burden, and less frequent tooth brushing were associated with a greater DMFT score.", 
    "105": "Given that poor dental condition has been related with an increased risk of physical co-morbidities, physicians should be aware of patients' dental status, especially for aged smoking patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, for schizophrenia patients who do not regularly brush their teeth or who exhibit tremor, it may be advisable for caregivers to encourage and help them to perform tooth brushing more frequently.", 
    "106": "Metabolic control analysis allows the study of metabolic regulation. We applied both single- and double-manipulation top-down control analysis to examine the control of lipid accumulation in developing oilseed rape (Brassica napus) embryos. The biosynthetic pathway was conceptually divided into two blocks of reactions (fatty acid biosynthesis (Block A), lipid assembly (Block B)) connected by a single system intermediate, the acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) pool. Single manipulation used exogenous oleate. Triclosan was used to inhibit specifically Block A, whereas diazepam selectively manipulated flux through Block B. Exogenous oleate inhibited the radiolabelling of fatty acids from [1-(14)C]acetate, but stimulated that from [U-14C]glycerol into acyl lipids. The calculation of group flux control coefficients showed that c. 70% of the metabolic control was in the lipid assembly block of reactions. Monte Carlo simulations gave an estimation of the error of the resulting group flux control coefficients as 0.27\u00b10.06 for Block A and 0.73\u00b10.06 for Block B. The two methods of control analysis gave very similar results and showed that Block B reactions were more important under our conditions. This contrasts notably with data from oil palm or olive fruit cultures and is important for efforts to increase oilseed rape lipid yields.", 
    "107": "The new anti-aggregating agent prasugrel is bioactivated by cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A and 2B6. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor and was shown in vitro as a CYP2B6 inhibitor. The aim of this open-label cross-over study was to assess the effect of ritonavir on prasugrel active metabolite (prasugrel AM) pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. Ten healthy male volunteers received 10\u00a0mg prasugrel. After at least a week washout, they received 100\u00a0mg ritonavir, followed by 10\u00a0mg prasugrel 2\u00a0hr later. We used dried blood spot sampling method to monitor prasugrel AM pharmacokinetics (C(max) , t(1/2) , t(max) , AUC(0-6\u00a0hr) ) at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4 and 6\u00a0hr after prasugrel administration. A 'cocktail' approach was used to measure CYP2B6, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A activities. In the presence of ritonavir, prasugrel AM C(max) and AUC were decreased by 45% (mean ratio: 0.55, CI 90%: 0.40-0.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and 38% (mean ratio: 0.62, CI 90%: 0.54-0.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), respectively, while t(1/2) and t(max) were not affected. Midazolam metabolic ratio (MR) dramatically decreased in presence of ritonavir (6.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 versus 0.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07) reflecting an almost complete inhibition of CYP3A4, whereas omeprazole, flurbiprofen and bupropion MR were not affected. These data demonstrate that ritonavir is able to block prasugrel CYP3A4 bioactivation. This CYP-mediated drug-drug interaction might lead to a significant reduction of prasugrel efficacy in HIV-infected patients with acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "108": "Genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes could lead to a phenotype with altered enzyme activity. In pharmacotherapy, genotype-based dose recommendations achieved great importance for several drugs. In our pilot study, we ask if these genetic tests should be applied to forensic problems as a matter of routine. Starting from 2004 through 2008, we screened routine cases for samples where the relation of parent compound to metabolite(s) (P/M ratio), particularly morphine to codeine ratios and diazepam to its metabolites, was noticeable or not consistent with the information provided by the defendants. We found 11 samples with conspicuous results. These were analyzed for polymorphisms of the CYP 2D6 and 2C19 genes using the Roche AmpliChip Cytochrome P450 Genotyping test. If not previously conducted, a general unknown analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was additionally carried out. For CYP 2D6, we found two cases with the genotype poor metabolizer (PM), three cases with heterozygote extensive metabolizer genotype classified as an intermediate metabolizer (IM) with probably reduced enzyme activities, but no ultrarapid metabolizer genotype. For CYP 2C19, two cases were characterized as IM phenotypes, with no PM found. Once we achieved no appropriate amounts of DNA, one case was excluded after GC/MS analysis. Only in one case could the polymorphism clearly explain the changes in drug metabolism. More frequently, a drug-drug interaction was thought to have a stronger impact. Additionally, our results suggest that IM genotypes may be more relevant than previously suspected. With respect to the small number of cases in which we thought a genotyping would be helpful, we conclude that the overall relevance of toxicogenetics in forensic problems is moderate. However, in some individual cases, a genotyping may provide new insight.",

Patients were randomly assigned to either a benzodiazepine loading protocol or a symptom-triggered treatment protocol. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised scale (CIWA-Ar) was recorded throughout the length of stay, along with measures of autonomic system functioning.",

Average rate of change for systolic blood pressure was -2.7 \u00b1 5.3 for the symptom-triggered group and -2.3 \u00b1 6.4 for the loading group. There was no significant difference between the rates of change for either group on either measure. Similarly, there was no significant difference in total benzodiazepine use between groups. Within 72 h of treatment, 69.6% of patients in the loading group were free of withdrawal symptoms versus 41.7% in the symptom-triggered group, a difference not reaching statistical significance.",

    "113": "In this study we evaluated the influence of neonatal tactile stimulation (TS) on behavioral and biochemical effects related to a low dose of diazepam (DZP) in adult rats. Male pups of Wistar rats were handled (TS) daily from PND1 to PND21 for 10 min, while unhandled (UH) rats were not touched. In adulthood, half the animals of each group received a single administration of diazepam (0.25mg/kg body weight i.p.) or vehicle and then were submitted to behavioral and biochemical evaluations. In the TS group, DZP administration reduced anxiety-like symptoms in different behavioral paradigms (elevated plus maze, EPM; staircase and open-field and defensive burying) and increased exploratory behavior. These findings show that neonatal TS increased DZP pharmacological responses in adulthood compared to neonatally UH animals, as observed by reduced anxiety-like symptoms and lower levels of plasma cortisol. TS also changed plasma levels of antioxidant defenses such as vitamin C and glutathione peroxidase, whose increase may be involved in lower oxidative damages to proteins in cortex, subthalamic region and hippocampus of these animals. Here we are showing for the first time that neonatal TS is able to change responsiveness to benzodiazepine drugs in adulthood and provides better pharmacological responses in novel situations of stress.", 
    "114": "(S)-Warfarin 7-hydroxylation and midazolam 1'-hydroxylation are among the preferred probe substrate reactions for CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5, respectively. The impact of solvents on enzyme activity, kinetic parameters, and predicted in vivo hepatic clearance (Cl(H)) associated with each reaction has not been evaluated. The effects of increasing concentrations [0.1-2% (v/v)] of six organic solvents (acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetone, isopropanol) were first tested on each reaction using human liver microsomes (HLMs), human intestinal microsomes (midazolam 1'-hydroxylation only), and recombinant enzymes. Across enzyme sources, relative to water, acetonitrile and methanol had the least inhibitory effect on (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation (0-58 and 9-96%, respectively); acetonitrile, methanol, and ethanol had the least inhibitory effect on midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (0-29, 0-22, and 0-20%, respectively). Using HLMs, both acetonitrile and methanol (0.1-2%) decreased the V(max) (32-60 and 24-65%, respectively) whereas methanol (2%) increased the K(m) (100%) of (S)-warfarin-hydroxylation. (S)-Warfarin Cl(H) was underpredicted by 21-65% (acetonitrile) and 13-84% (methanol). Acetonitrile, methanol, and ethanol had minimal to modest impact on both the kinetics of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (10-24%) and predicted midazolam Cl(H) (2-20%). In conclusion, either acetonitrile or methanol at \u22640.1% is recommended as the primary organic solvent for the (S)-warfarin 7-hydroxylation reaction; acetonitrile is preferred if higher solvent concentrations are required. Acetonitrile, methanol, and ethanol at \u22642% are recommended as primary organic solvents for the midazolam 1'-hydroxylation reaction. This information should facilitate optimization of experimental conditions and improve the interpretation and accuracy of in vitro-in vivo predictions involving these two preferred cytochrome P450 probe substrate reactions.",

Among patients on sedative-hypnotics, amnestic SRED and sleepwalking were more common in the setting of RLS (80%) than INS (8%; p < 0.0001). Further, NE and SRED in RLS were not secondary to dopaminergic therapy, as RLS patients demonstrated a substantial drop (68% to 34%; p = 0.0026) in the frequency of NE after dopamine agents were initiated, and there were no cases of dopaminergic agents inducing novel NE or SRED.",

Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells were used as a model of intestinal epithelial cells. Recombinant adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (AdGFP) and CYP3A4 (AdCYP3A4) was used as vectors. On day 2 after seeding MDCKII cells onto a semipermeable membrane, cells were infected with each adenovirus vector at various MOIs (multiplicities of infection) ranging from 0 to 200. On day 5, cell monolayers were used for drug transport study. The expression of GFP in monolayers of MDCKII cells transduced with AdGFP increased MOI-dependently and adenoviral infection showed no effect on the membrane permeability of drugs. The metabolite formation rate of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, in the permeation process of a monolayer linearly increased with an increase in the MOI of AdCYP3A4. When the period that vectors and cells were located adjacent to each other was prolonged, the rate increased 2-fold compared with that calculated from a result with a monolayer obtained from a shorter period of adjacency.

[\u00b9\u00b9C]DAA1106 binding to PBR was significantly increased in widespread areas in MCI subjects when compared to healthy controls. We found no significant difference in BP between MCI and AD patients. MCI subjects with [\u00b9\u00b9C]DAA1106 binding values higher than the control mean +0.5 standard deviation (S.D.) developed dementia within 5 years.

The behavioral effects of the dopamine-like substances were evaluated under conditions of acute and chronic experiments. In acute experiment, a single dose of substances was administered 45 min prior to the behavioral testing of animals. In chronic experiment, the synthesized compounds were administered in a single daily dose for 14 days. Pharmacological analysis of the effect of drugs was performed in the following doses: 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mg/kg (i.p., introduction). Diazepam was used as a reference drug that was introduced in a dose of 1.0 mg/kg (i.p.). The anxiety-like state was determined using the elevated plus maze test, while the behavioral effects were evaluated in the open field test. It was found that IEM-2111, IEM-2122, and IEM-2123 exhibited anxiolytic action under condition of chronic administration, whereas IEM-2126 produced an anxiolytic effect only after acute administration. The introduction of left optical isomers of aromatic or heterocyclic radicals of amino acids into the molecule of 3,4-dimetoxyphenylethylamine results in a more pronounced anxiolytic effect upot chronic administration. The degree of action of the new amino acid derivatives of dopamine has a dose-dependent character, and the maximum effect is manifested at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg.",

    "141": "Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) is a potent convulsant that is considered a chemical threat agent. We characterized TETS as an activator of spontaneous Ca\u00b2\u207a oscillations and electrical burst discharges in mouse hippocampal neuronal cultures at 13-17 days in vitro using FLIPR Fluo-4 fluorescence measurements and extracellular microelectrode array recording. Acute exposure to TETS (\u2265 2 \u00b5M) reversibly altered the pattern of spontaneous neuronal discharges, producing clustered burst firing and an overall increase in discharge frequency. TETS also dramatically affected Ca\u00b2\u207a dynamics causing an immediate but transient elevation of neuronal intracellular Ca\u00b2\u207a followed by decreased frequency of Ca\u00b2\u207a oscillations but greater peak amplitude. The effect on Ca\u00b2\u207a dynamics was similar to that elicited by picrotoxin and bicuculline, supporting the view that TETS acts by inhibiting type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor function. The effect of TETS on Ca\u00b2\u207a dynamics requires activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, because the changes induced by TETS were prevented by MK-801 block of NMDA receptors, but not nifedipine block of L-type Ca\u00b2\u207a channels. Pretreatment with the GABA(A) receptor-positive modulators diazepam and allopregnanolone partially mitigated TETS-induced changes in Ca\u00b2\u207a dynamics. Moreover, low, minimally effective concentrations of diazepam (0.1 \u00b5M) and allopregnanolone (0.1 \u00b5M), when administered together, were highly effective in suppressing TETS-induced alterations in Ca\u00b2\u207a dynamics, suggesting that the combination of positive modulators of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors may have therapeutic potential. These rapid throughput in vitro assays may assist in the identification of single agents or combinations that have utility in the treatment of TETS intoxication.",

Data were collected from 2492 seriously injured drivers of cars and vans in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Lithuania, and the Netherlands, between 2007 and 2010. Toxicological analysis was performed with chromatographic techniques on whole blood for 23 substances. The percentage of drivers positive for at least one psychoactive substance ranged between 28% (Lithuania) and 53% (Belgium). Alcohol (\u22650.1 g/L) was the most common finding with the highest percentage in Belgium (42.5%). Among the alcohol-positive drivers, 90.5% had a blood alcohol count (BAC) \u22650.5 g/L and 65.7% had a BAC \u22651.3 g/L. Benzodiazepines (0.0-10.2%) and medicinal opioids (0.5-7.8%) were the most prevailing medicinal drugs, but half of the concentrations were lower than therapeutic. Cannabis (0.5-7.6%) was the most prevailing illicit drug. Alcohol was found in combination with drugs in 2.3-13.2% of the drivers. Drug combinations were found in 0.5-4.3% of the drivers. This study confirms the high prevalence of psychoactive substances in injured drivers, but we observed large differences between the participating countries. Alcohol was the most common finding, followed by cannabis and benzodiazepines. Notable are the many drivers having a BAC \u2265 1.3 g/L. The majority of the substances were found in combination with another psychoactive substance, mostly alcohol. The high prevalence of high BACs and combinations (compared to roadside surveys) suggest that those drivers are most at risk and that preventive actions should target them preferentially.",

    "144": "The anxiolytic-like effect of aqueous crude extract of M. frutescens (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg) was investigated in male Wistar rats evaluated in the elevated plus-maze and compared with several doses of diazepam (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg) as a reference anxiolytic drug. Picrotoxin (1 mg/kg), a noncompetitive antagonist of the GABA(A) receptor, was used in experimental procedures to evaluate if this receptor could be involved in the anxiolytic-like effects produced by M. frutescens. To discard hypoactivity, hyperactivity, or no changes associated with treatments, which could interfere with the behavioral activity in the elevated plus-maze, rats were subjected to the open field test.", 
    "145": "M. frutescens at 50 mg/kg showed anxiolytic-like activity similarly to 2 mg/kg of diazepam, without disrupts in general motor activity. The anxiolytic-like effect of M. frutescens detected in the elevated plus-maze was blocked by picrotoxin, indicating that GABA(A) receptors are involved in the modulation of this effect.", 
    "146": "The results corroborate the use of M. frutescens in folk Mexican ethnomedicine as a potential anxiolytic agent and suggest that this effect is mediated by the GABA(A) receptors. Additionally, some sedative effects with high doses of M. frutescens were detected in the present study.",

Studies were included if the on-the-road driving test was employed, using the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), i.e., the weaving of the car, as primary outcome measure.", 
    "149": "A total of 24 studies were identified that employed the on-the-road driving test to examine driving performance after administration of benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Eleven of these studies (45.8%) measured blood drug concentrations after the on-the-road driving test was performed. Technical reports of some of these studies provided individual data on blood drug concentrations and \u0394SDLP (the \u0394SDLP difference between drug and placebo). While group differences in concentrations were found as evidenced by significant effects of dose and time of driving since time of drug ingestion, no significant relationship between individual blood drug concentrations and \u0394SDLP was found in any of the studies.", 
    "150": "While group mean average \u0394SDLP and blood drug concentration sometimes correlate, individual differences in blood drug concentrations of benzodiazepine receptor agonists correlate poorly with driving impairment. From the currently available data, it must be concluded that there are no significant relationships between individual blood drug concentration and \u0394SDLP. Future driving studies should assess blood drug levels as a standard procedure, to enable further research into the relationship between blood drug concentration and performance impairment.",

    "155": "This study aims to use solid phase microextraction (SPME), a simple tool to investigate diffusion rate (time) constant of selected pharmaceuticals in gel and fish muscle by comparing desorption rate of diffusion of the drugs in both agarose gel prepared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and fish muscle. The gel concentration (agarose gel model) that could be used to simulate tissue matrix (fish muscle) for free diffusion of drugs under in vitro and in vivo conditions was determined to model mass transfer phenomena between fibre polymer coating and environmental matrix such that partition coefficients and desorption time constant (diffusion coefficient) can be determined. SPME procedure involves preloading the extraction phase (fibre) with the standards from spiked PBS for 1h via direct extraction. Subsequently, the preloaded fibre is introduced to the sample such fish or agarose gel for specified time ranging from 0.5 to 60 h. Then, fibre is removed at specified time and desorbed in 100 \u03bcL of desorption solution (acetonitrile: water 1:1) for 90 min under agitation speed of 1000 rpm. The samples extract were immediately injected to the instrument and analysed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The limit of detection of the method in gel and fish muscle was 0.01-0.07 ng mL(-1) and 0.07-0.34 ng g(-1), respectively, while the limit quantification was 0.10-0.20 ng mL(-1) in gel samples and 0.40-0.97 ng g(-1) in fish sample. The reproducibility of the method was good (5-15% RSD). The results suggest that kinetics of desorption of the compounds in fish tissue and different viscosity of gel can be determined using desorption time constant. In this study, desorption time constant which is directly related to desorption rate (diffusion kinetics) of selected drugs from the fibre to the gel matrix is faster as the viscosity of the gel matrix reduces from 2% (w/v) to 0.8% (w/v). As the concentration of gel reduces, viscosity of the gel will be reduced therefore allowing faster diffusion which invariably affect desorption time constant. Also, desorption time constant of model drugs in the fish muscle and 0.8-0.9% (w/v) gel model are similar based on free diffusion of studied compounds. In addition, in vitro and in vivo desorption time constant comparison shows that desorption time constant in an in vivo system (live fish muscle) is generally higher than an in vitro system (dead fish muscle) except for sertraline and nordiazepam. This study demonstrates SPME as a simple investigative tool to understand kinetics of desorption in an in vivo system with a goal to measure desorption rate of pharmaceuticals in fish.",

The average anxiety level of children entering the OR was much lower in the MaG and Ma/MiG groups than in the SaG group (P < 0.05). During induction, the anxiety level increased in the SaG and MaG groups but decreased in the MiG and Ma/MiG groups (P < 0.05). At the postoperative third day, the incidence of mask fears was as high as 23% in the SaG group, 15% in the MiG group, but only 2.5% in the MaG and Ma/MiG groups.",

A mask preconditioning and midazolam combination did not increase mask acceptance during inhalational induction, reduce mask fears postoperatively, improve induction compliance, nor shorten the total mask time. But it can better reduce the anxiety level during induction.",

Although choreiform movements were reported in adults with amphetamine abuse and in those under therapeutic treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, previous literature concerning the pediatric population is spare. We describe two children who developed chorea after ingesting amphetamine-derived medications prescribed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Patient 1, a 10-year-old boy, accidently received an extra dose of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate the night before the onset of acute chorea involving his arms, legs, and trunk. Patient 2, an 8-month-old boy, accidentally ingested his stepbrother's mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall XR) and developed acute chorea. Benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine, benztropine, and opioids did not suppress the chorea in either case. The 10-year-old received haloperidol, which significantly improved his abnormal findings, and he returned to baseline in approximately 48 hours. The 8-month-old was observed in the pediatric intensive care unit, and his signs resolved by 72 hours. Our cases demonstrate that choreiform movements of sustained duration can occur in children with acute supratherapeutic ingestions of amphetamine-derived medications.",

Adverse effects comprise sedation subjectively and cognitive and psychomotor impairment objectively. Complex skills such as driving can be compromised. Paradoxical excitement can have forensic implications. Long term use beyond the licensed durations is common but both efficacy and adverse effects associated with this have been poorly documented. Withdrawal and dependence have excited particular concern, and even polemic. Perhaps a third of long term (beyond 6\u2009 months) users experience symptoms and signs on attempting to withdraw - anxiety, insomnia, muscle spasms and tension and perceptual hypersensitivity. Uncommonly, fits or a psychosis may supervene. The patterns following withdrawal vary widely. The usual method of withdrawal is slow tapering but it may not obviate the problems completely. BZDs are also drugs of abuse either on their own or in conjunction with opioids and stimulants. Claims have been made that the use of BZDs is associated with increased mortality. This is a concern in view of the widespread usage of these drugs, particularly in the elderly. All of these factors impinge on the risk\u2009:\u2009benefit ratio and the severity of the indications. Harm reduction should focus on choice of alternative treatments both psychological and pharmacological. Guidelines emphasise that BZDs are not drugs of first choice and should only be used short term. Schedules are available to educate about methods of withdrawal in current users, emphasising the slow rate of taper. General principles of harm minimization in the addiction field are appropriate to BZD abuse.",

    "185": "The 61-year-old housewife was diagnosed to have PD for 12 years with initial presentation of clumsiness and rest tremor of right limbs. She was referred to our hospital in March 2009 due to shortening of drug beneficial period since 3 years ago and on-phase dyskinesia in recent 2 years. Bilateral STN DBS was conducted on 18 June, 2009. Fluctuating spells of mental confusion were developed on the next day after surgery. Electric stimuli via DBS electrodes were delivered with parameters of 2 volts, 60 \u03bcs, 130 Hz on bilateral STN 32 days after DBS. The incoherent behaviors and motor fluctuation remained to occur. The beneficial effect of zolpidem on her neuropsychiatric and motor symptoms was detected incidentally in early July 2009. She could chat normally with her caregiver and walk with assistance after taking zolpidem. The beneficial period may last for 2 hours. Zolpidem was then given in dosage of 10 mg three times per day. The neuropsychiatric inventory was scored 56 during zolpidem 'off' and 30 during zolpidem 'on'. To understand the intriguing feature, we conducted FDG-PET during 'off' and 'on' zolpidem conditions.

    "187": "Patients with cerebral degenerative conditions commonly suffer from a variety of sleep disorders, including sleep-disordered breathing, insomnia, parasomnias (REM sleep behavior disorder), circadian rhythm disturbances, and restless legs syndrome. When these sleep disorders go unrecognized and untreated, they can lead to decreased quality of life and worsening neurological symptoms related to the underlying condition. Appropriate management initially requires taking a careful history from the patient and bed partner regarding their sleep. In addition, polysomnography may be required to aid in the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing or parasomnias. Occasionally, adjusting the dosages of sedating or sleep disrupting medications and improving sleep hygiene may improve sleep complaints. However, in most cases restoring quality nighttime sleep requires specific therapeutic intervention. In patients that suffer from sleep apnea, this usually means treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), positional therapy, dental appliances, upper airway surgery, or weight loss. Pharmacological treatment of insomnia in patients with cerebral degenerative conditions can be difficult due to side effects (worsening balance, cognition) and lack of data in this patient population. Behavioral strategies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy have been effective and are considered safer than hypnotic therapy, but can be limited due to access to trained providers (distance and number of providers) and limited cognitive functioning of the patient. Parasomnias, namely REM sleep behavior disorder, are managed by looking for any underlying cause of arousals (sleep apnea, periodic leg movements of sleep), implementing safety precautions, and pharmacologically with either benzodiazepines or melatonin. Restless legs syndrome may improve with iron replacement or dopamine agonist therapy, as it does in other patient populations. Light therapy may be beneficial in patients suffering from circadian rhythm disorders such as advanced sleep phase syndrome.", 
    "188": "There are several modulatory sites at GABA(A) receptors, which mediate the actions of many drugs, among them benzodiazepine. Three kinds of allosteric modulators act through the benzodiazepine binding site: positive (agonist), neutral (antagonist), and negative (inverse agonist). The goal of the present study was to examine the influence of the inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) acting on \u03b1 GABA(A) receptor and compare its dose-response effects on memory and depression-like behavior. We independently studied the effects of DMCM (0.05-1.0 mg/kg) on retention versus acquisition of active avoidance and depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. Throughout the study, drugs were given intraperitoneally, 30 min before testing. ANOVA has showed that treatment with DMCM significantly affected retrieval of avoidance response (p<0.05), exerted promnesic effects in inverted U-shape manner. Dunnett's test indicated that the DMCM avoidance-facilitatory dose was 0.1mg/kg. At the dose facilitating retrieval of avoidance memory, DMCM significantly (p<0.05, comparison of regression coefficients by Student's t-test) and progressively increased acquisition rate during 5 days training, compared to the saline group. In forced swim test, ANOVA indicated statistically significant effects of DMCM (p<0.05). Dunnett's analysis showed that DMCM significantly decreased immobility time at the dose of 0.1mg/kg, exerted acute antidepressant-like effects. Our results experimentally support the findings that under certain circumstances, nonselective benzodiazepine site inverse agonists, produce memory-enhancing and antidepressant-like effects. The molecular and neuronal substrates linking the actions of specific GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex subunits remains to be further elucidated.",

Uncapped and capped PCLA-PEG-PCLA triblock copolymers, abbreviated as degree of modification 0 and 2 (DM0 and DM2, respectively), were composed of identical PCLA and PEG blocks but different end groups: namely hydroxyl and hexanoyl end groups. DM0 was synthesized by ring opening polymerization of l-lactide and \u03b5-caprolactone in toluene using PEG as initiator and tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate as the catalyst. A portion of DM0 was subsequently reacted with an excess of hexanoyl chloride in solution to yield DM2. The cloud point and phase behaviour of DM0 and DM2 in buffer as well as that of their blends were determined by light scattering in a diluted state and by vial tilting and rheological measurements in a concentrated state. Degradation/dissolution properties of temperature-responsive gelling systems were studied in vitro at pH 7.4 and 37\u00b0C. The cloud points of DM0/DM2 blends were ratio-dependent and could be tailored from 15 to 40\u00b0C for blends containing 15 to 100wt.% DM0. Vial tilting and rheological experiments showed that, with solid contents between 20 and 30wt.%, DM0/DM2 blends (15/85 to 25/75w/w) had a sol-to-gel transition temperature at 10-20\u00b0C, whereas blends with less than 15wt.% DM0 formed gels below 4\u00b0C and the ones with more than 25wt.% DM0 did not show a sol-to-gel transition up to 50\u00b0C. Complete degradation of temperature-responsive gelling systems took \u223c100days, independent of the DM0 fraction and the initial solid content. Analysis of residual gels in time by GPC and (1)H-NMR showed no chemical polymer degradation, but indicated gel degradation by dissolution. Preferential dissolution of lactoyl-rich polymers induced enrichment of the residual gels in caproyl-rich polymers. To the best of our knowledge, degradation of temperature-responsive gelling systems by dissolution has not been reported or hypothesized as being the consequence of acylation of polymers. In conclusion, blending of PCLA-PEG-PCLA triblock polymers composed of identical backbones but different end groups provides for a straightforward preparation of temperature-responsive gelling systems with well-characterized rheological properties and potential in drug delivery. Furthermore, acylation of triblock copolymers may allow for the design of bioerodible systems with control over degradation by polymer dissolution.", 
    "190": "Treatment of violent behaviors in sleep depends on the underlying condition and a correct identification of the causative disorder is mandatory. After eliminating possible precipitating factors, pharmacological treatment is often required to control violent sleep behaviors. Although no drugs are specifically approved for the treatment of parasomnias and placebo-controlled trials are lacking in these patient populations, clonazepam is considered the drug of choice in the management of both Non-REM and REM parasomnias. Benzodiazepines may cause unwanted side effects especially in older individuals and tolerance is sometime observed. Melatonin and pramipexole may represent alternative options in REM sleep behavior disorder. Hypnosis therapy may be considered in arousal disorders when pharmacological treatment is contraindicated or ineffective. Management of nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy include a first-step pharmacological approach with antiepileptic drugs (eg, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine or other drugs effective on partial seizures), but surgical options may be considered in drug refractory patients.

For induction, a combination of 25\u2009mg of meperidine and 2.5\u2009mg of midazolam were administered in both groups. In the cocktail group, a bolus dose of propofol 1\u2009mg/kg was administered and continuously infused. In the controls, 25\u2009mg of meperidine or 2.5\u2009mg/kg of midazolam were titrated to maintain the level of sedation.",

    "199": "Songbirds have emerged as attractive model systems in many areas of biological research. Notably, songbirds are used in studies of the neurobiological and neuroendocrine mechanisms that shape vocal communication, and zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) are the most commonly studied species. In these studies, some form of chemical restraint is often needed to facilitate procedures and to minimize the risk of injury during handling. To determine the minimum dose of the benzodiazepine diazepam that is adequate to achieve deep sedation across individual birds, a low dose (5 mg/kg) and a high dose (10 mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly to 20 zebra finches. Results showed that a 10 mg/kg dose of diazepam resulted in deep sedation, defined by dorsal recumbency, which was achieved in minutes and lasted for several hours. Sedation was induced without complication, because no birds displayed signs of distress during sedation or lethargy after recovery, and was adequate to permit minimally invasive surgical procedures. In addition, the duration of sedation was dose dependent, which provides additional information for researchers who seek to match the depth of sedation to their experimental requirements. Finally, complete recovery from the deeply sedated state was induced by a 0.3 mg/kg dose of the antagonist flumazenil, which enabled birds to more rapidly resume homeostatic behaviors to promote well-being and survival. Together, these results indicate that diazepam is a safe and reliable sedative for use in zebra finches and support specific recommendations to achieve rapid and reliable sedation and recovery.",

It is not well understood which interactions of deleted genes in 22q11.2 regions are responsible for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, but catechol-O-methytransferase (COMT) is among the candidates. Df1/+ mice are 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) model mice with a hemizygous deletion of 18 genes in the 22q11-related region. Df1/+ mice showed enhanced response to the dopamine D1 agonist, SKF38393, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, MK801, which can be normalized by a GABA(A) receptor agonist, bretazenil, or a GABA(A) \u03b12/\u03b13 receptor agonist, SL651498. Here, we demonstrated the curing effects of virus-mediated reintroduction of Comt to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in Df1/+ mice. In contrast, both Comt overexpression and Comt inhibition caused an abnormal responsiveness to Bretazenil, a GABA(A) receptor agonist in control mice. Comt overexpression increased MK801-induced interneuronal activation and GABA release in the PFC. The expression levels of GABA-related genes such as Gabrb2 (GABA(A)receptor \u03b22), Gad2 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (Gad65)) and Reln (Reelin) correlate with a Comt expression level in PFC. Our data suggest that Comt-mediated regulation of GABAergic system might be involved in the behavioral pathogenesis of Df1/+ mice.",

This cross-sectional study in 59 renal transplant patients investigated the relationship among in vivo CYP3A4 activity (assessed using midazolam as a drug probe), CYP3A5 genotype on the one hand, and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics on the other hand, taking into account other potential determinants of tacrolimus disposition. In vivo CYP3A4 activity and CYP3A5 genotype explain 56-59% of variability in tacrolimus dose requirements and clearance, contributing ~25 and 30%, respectively. Hematocrit explains an additional 4-14%. These data indicate that CYP3A4- and CYP3A5-mediated tacrolimus metabolisms are major determinants of tacrolimus disposition in vivo and explain a substantial part of the clinically observed high interindividual variability in tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, these data provide a potential basis for a comprehensive approach to predicting tacrolimus dose requirement in individual patients and hence provide a strategy to tailor immunosuppressive therapy in transplant recipients.",

IDILI may arise from the interaction of a drug's reactive metabolite with a mild inflammation that renders the liver more sensitive to injury resulting in increased toxicity (inflammatory stress hypothesis). Aiming to develop a robust ex vivo screening method to study inflammatory stress-related IDILI mechanisms and to find biomarkers that can detect or predict IDILI, mouse precision-cut liver slices (mPCLS) were coincubated for 24 h with IDILI-related drugs and lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide exacerbated ketoconazole (15 \u03bcM) and clozapine (45 \u03bcM) toxicity but not their non-IDILI-related comparators, voriconazole (1500 \u03bcM) and olanzapine (45 \u03bcM). However, the other IDILI-related drugs tested [diclofenac (200 \u03bcM), carbamazepine (400 \u03bcM), and troglitazone (30 \u03bcM)] did not cause synergistic toxicity with lipopolysaccharide after 24 h of incubation. Lipopolysaccharide further decreased the reduced glutathione levels caused by ketoconazole or clozapine in mPCLS after 24 h of incubation, which was not the case for the other drugs. Lipopolysaccharide significantly increased nitric oxide (NO), cytokine, and chemokine release into the mPCLS media, while the treatment with the drugs alone did not cause any substantial change. All seven drugs drastically reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced NO production. Interestingly, only ketoconazole and clozapine increased the lipopolysaccharide-induced granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) release. Pilot experiments showed that diclofenac and troglitazone, but not carbamazepine, demonstrated synergistic toxicity with lipopolysaccharide after a longer incubation of 48 h in mPCLS. In conclusion, we have developed an ex vivo model to detect inflammatory stress-related liver toxicity and identified ketoconazole, clozapine, troglitazone, and diclofenac as drugs that showed synergistic toxicity with lipopolysaccharide. Reduced glutathione, G-CSF, and GM-CSF were identified to be potential biomarkers for IDILI-inducing drugs mediated by inflammatory stress, and mPCLS appear to be a promising screening tool to further unravel the mechanism of IDILI.",

Relatively little is known of the interactions between Western drugs and traditional drugs such as Kampo extract medicines (Japanese medicines modified from traditional Chinese medicines). This study investigated the effects of the marketed Kampo extract medicines, Senkyu-cha-cho-san and Sokei-kakketsu-to, on the intestinal absorption of CYP or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vivo. Midazolam, a CYP3A substrate drug, or talinolol, a P-gp substrate drug, was orally administered to rats with each of these Kampo extract medicines. Senkyu-cha-chosan or Sokei-kakketsu-to administered as a standard regimen did not obviously affect Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of midazolam, although both Kampo extract medicines contained notopterol, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor in vitro. The results implied a lack of potent drug-drug interactions between both Kampo extract medicines and CYP3A substrate drugs. Concomitant administration of each Kampo extract medicine unexpectedly showed the tendency to decrease Cmax and AUC of talinolol. Decreased intestinal absorption of talinolol might be caused, not by the inhibition of P-gp, but by the inhibition of organic anion transporting peptides by both Kampo extract medicines.",

Data were recorded using Clinica and IANUS software and consulting all paper records of patients with symptoms of poisoning. Data from a total of 1893 patients with a mean age of 35.6 \u00b1 17.6 years (66% men) were included. Highest rates of poisoning were recorded on Saturdays and Sundays during the summer months (June, July and August). Drugs of abuse were the most common toxic agents (70.4%), ethyl alcohol accounting for 61% of these cases, which often involved males and with people with high degrees of dependency. In second place was poisoning resulting from the abuse of medical drugs, more commonly associated with females, and involving benzodiazepines in 73.2% of cases. The majority of these intoxications were intentional, and suicide attempts accounted for 18.8%. The problems most commonly resulting from the poisoning were neurological, and mortality rate was just 0.2%.", 
    "210": "Translocator protein (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a ubiquitous drug- and cholesterol-binding protein primarily found in the outer mitochondrial membrane as part of a mitochondrial cholesterol transport complex. TSPO is present at higher levels in steroid-synthesizing and rapidly proliferating tissues and its biological role has been mainly linked to mitochondrial function, steroidogenesis and cell proliferation/apoptosis. Aberrant TSPO levels have been linked to multiple diseases, including cancer, endocrine disorders, brain injury, neurodegeneration, ischemia-reperfusion injury and inflammatory diseases. Investigation of the functions of this protein in vitro and in vivo have been mainly carried out using high-affinity drug ligands, such as isoquinoline carboxamides and benzodiazepines and more recently, gene silencing methods. To establish a model to study the regulation of Tspo transcription in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequorea coerulescens under control of the Tspo promoter region (Tspo-AcGFP). The expression profiles of Tspo-AcGFP, endogenous TSPO and Tspo mRNA were found to be well-correlated. Tspo-AcGFP synthesis in the transgenic mice was seen in almost every tissue examined and as with TSPO in wild-type mice, Tspo-AcGFP was highly expressed in steroidogenic cells of the endocrine and reproductive systems, epithelial cells of the digestive system, skeletal muscle and other organs. In summary, this transgenic Tspo-AcGFP mouse model recapitulates endogenous Tspo expression patterns and could be a useful, tractable tool for monitoring the transcriptional regulation and function of Tspo in live animal experiments."
