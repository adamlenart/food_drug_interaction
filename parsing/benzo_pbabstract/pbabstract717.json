    "0": "Diazepam did not alter the rate or rhythm in III patients with atrial fibrillation. In 3 out of 38 patients with atrial flutter the use of diazepam was followed by an increase in atrioventricular block. Diazepam restored sinus rhythm in I patient with atrial tachycardia (total 7 patients) and in I patient with ventricular tachycardia (total 8 patients). Experimentally in the dog diazepam raised the electrically-induced ventricular tachycardia threshold significantly. Pretreatment with diazepam did not alter significantly the dose of strophanthidin K required to induce ventricular tachycardia in the dog. The value of diazepam as a cardiac anti-arrhythmic agent should be further assessed in a controlled clinical trial, especially in patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "1": "1. Male albino mice were watched in red light on a tunnel board to test exploration and their motor activity was assessed in an open cage, 30 min after intraperitoneal injection of drugs.2. Atropine and methylatropine 5 or 10 mg/kg did not alter the motor activity of the mice, while chlordiazepoxide 25 or 50 mg/kg and diazepam 10 or 20 mg/kg increased the activity, especially at the lower of the two doses used.3. All the compounds used except methylatropine adversely affected the exploratory behaviour.4. When atropine 10 mg/kg was given with the benzodiazepines, the activity of the mice was reduced and exploratory behaviour was further impaired. Methylatropine did not have this effect."
