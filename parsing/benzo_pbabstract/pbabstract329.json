    "0": "The ammonia and GABAergic neurotransmission hypotheses of the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) have appeared to be unrelated and perhaps mutually exclusive. Observations in animal models of fulminant hepatic failure, that are consistent with increased GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission contributing to the manifestations of HE, include: (i) abnormal visual evoked potential waveforms that resemble those induced by GABA(A)/benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor complex agonists; (ii) GABA(A)/BZ receptor complex antagonist-induced ameliorations of encephalopathy; (iii) increased resistance to drugs which decrease GABAergic tone; and (iv) hypersensitivity of CNS neurons to depression by GABA(A)/BZ receptor complex agonists. Mechanisms of increased GABAergic tone in HE may include the following: (i) increased brain concentrations of natural BZs; and (ii) increased GABA concentrations in synaptic clefts, possibly due to increased blood-brain-barrier permeability to GABA and a decrease in GABA(B) receptor density. Both neuroelectrophysiological and behavioral data indicate that ammonia concentrations in the range 0.75-2 mM induce increased excitatory neurotransmission. In contrast, recently, ammonia concentrations in the range 0.15-0.75 mM, i.e. concentrations that commonly occur in plasma in precoma HE, have been shown: (i) to increase GABA-induced chloride current in cultured neurons; and (ii) to enhance synergistically the binding of GABA(A)/BZ receptor agonists. In addition, increased ammonia concentrations enhance synthesis of neurosteroids in astrocytes, and some neurosteroids potently augment GABAergic neurotransmission. Thus, the modestly elevated concentrations of ammonia, that commonly occur in liver failure, may contribute to the manifestations of HE by enhancing GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission. This concept appears to unify the ammonia and GABAergic neurotransmission hypotheses.", 
    "1": "Portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE) is a serious neuropsychiatric condition that results from chronic liver failure and portal-systemic shunting of venous blood. PSE is particularly prevalent following treatment of portal hypertension or ascites by the TIPS procedure. Recent studies both in autopsied brain tissue from PSE patients as well as in experimental animal models of PSE reveal that chronic liver failure results in altered expression of several genes coding for proteins having key roles in the control of neuronal excitability. Such alterations include increased expression of monoamine oxidase (MAO-A isoform), the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor (PTBR) as well as constitutive, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Such changes result in altered protein expression and in increased degradation of monoamine neurotransmitters, increased synthesis of neurosteroids with inhibitory properties and increased production of nitric oxide (respectively) in brain in chronic liver failure. In the case of PTBR and nNOS, increases in expression result from exposure to ammonia and/or manganese, two neurotoxic agents shown previously to be increased in brain in chronic liver failure. Further elucidation of the consequences of neurotransmitter-related gene expression could identify new pathophysiologic mechanisms and result in new approaches to the prevention of PSE in chronic liver disease in humans.", 
    "2": "While the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) remains elusive, there is considerable evidence pointing to a key role of ammonia-induced dysfunction of astrocytes in this condition. Deficits in the ability of astrocytes to take up glutamate from the extracellular space may lead to abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, excessive stimulation of neuronal and glial glutamate receptors by elevated extracellular levels of glutamate may lead to excitotoxicity and greater glial dysfunction. Ammonia also causes upregulation of astroglial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) which is associated with increased production of neurosteroids. These neurosteroids have potent positive modulatory effects on the neuronal GABA(A) receptor which, combined with an ammonia-induced astroglial defect in GABA uptake, may result in enhanced GABAergic tone. Brain edema, associated with fulminant hepatic failure, may also result from astroglial abnormalities as the edema appears to be principally caused by swelling of these cells. Increased amounts of glutamine in astrocytes resulting from elevated brain ammonia levels may be a factor in this swelling. Other osmolytes such as glutathione may also be involved. Glial swelling may also result from NH4+ - and K+ -mediated membrane depolarization as well as by the actions of PBR agonists and neurosteroids. These findings show that an ammonia-induced gliopathy is a major factor in the pathogenesis of HE.", 
    "3": "In a previous work, the effects of cholecystokinin receptor agonists on tolerance to morphine antinociception were evaluated. In the present study, the influence of cholecystokinin antagonists on the inhibition of tolerance to morphine antinociception by cholecystokinin agonists has been investigated. Maximum tolerance to morphine antinociception was obtained by morphine administration (50 mg/kg) to mice once daily for 4 days. The cholecystokinin receptor agonists caerulein (0.005 mg/kg) or cholecystokinin-8 (0.01 mg/kg) but not unsulfated cholecystokinin-8 (0.01 mg/kg) decreased the development of tolerance to morphine (9 mg/kg). The cholecystokininA receptor antagonist MK-329 (1 mg/kg) or the cholecystokininB receptor antagonist L-365,260 (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg) also diminished the tolerance to morphine antinociception. When animals were challenged with different doses of MK-329 (0.25, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg) against cholecystokinin-8 (0.01 mg/kg), caerulein (0.005 mg/kg) or unsulfated cholecystokinin-8 (0.01 mg/kg) on day 4 in tolerant mice, different response were obtained. Higher doses of MK-329 (1 mg/kg) caused a small decrease in attenuation of the morphine tolerance induced by cholecystokinin-8 and caerulein. Low doses of L-365, 260 diminished the effect of cholecystokinin-8 on morphine tolerance. Conversely high doses of the drug potentiated the response of caerulein (0.005 mg/kg). When animals were treated with MK-329 or L-365,260 before unsulfated cholecystokinin-8, reduction of the tolerance to morphine antinociception was obtained. These data indicate that both cholecystokinin receptors may modulate morphine tolerance.", 
    "4": "Phencyclidine induces a model psychosis which can persist for prolonged periods and presents a strong drug model of schizophrenia. When given continuously for several days to rats, phencyclidine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists induce neural degeneration in a variety of limbic structures, including retrosplenial cortex, hippocampus, septohippocampal projections, and piriform cortex. In an attempt to further clarify the mechanisms underlying these degeneration patterns, autoradiographic studies using a variety of receptor ligands were conducted in animals 21 days after an identical dosage of the continuous phencyclidine administration employed in the previous degeneration studies. The results indicated enduring alterations in a number of receptors: these included decreased piperidyl-3,4-3H(N)-TCP (TCP), flunitrazepam, and mazindol binding in many of the limbic regions in which degeneration has been reported previously. Quinuclidinyl benzilate and (AMPA) binding were decreased in anterior cingulate and piriform cortex, and in accumbens and striatum. Piperidyl-3,4-3H(N)-TCP binding was decreased in most hippocampal regions. Many of these long-term alterations would not have been predicted by prior studies of the neurotoxic effects of continuous phencyclidine, and these results do not suggest a unitary source for the neurotoxicity. Whereas retrosplenial cortex, the structure which degenerates earliest, showed minimal alterations, some of the most consistent, long term alterations were in structures which evidence no immediate signs of neural degeneration, such as anterior cingulate cortex and caudate nucleus. In these structures, some of the receptor changes appeared to develop gradually (they were not present immediately after cessation of drug administration), and thus were perhaps due to changed input from regions evidencing neurotoxicity. Some of these findings, particularly in anterior cingulate, may have implications for models of schizophrenia.", 
    "5": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) and their endogenous ligands, the diazepam-binding inhibitor derived-peptides, are present in Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of reversible (freeze-injury) and permanent (transection and ligature) nerve lesion on PBR density and on the levels of their endogenous ligands, by autoradiography (using [3H]PK11195) and radioimmunoassay (using antisera directed against the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), a diazepam-binding inhibitor fragment). The potential role of PBR on peripheral nerve steroidogenesis, was studied by investigating the effect of specific PBR agonists and antagonists on pregnenolone levels in the sciatic nerve. Sixteen to 30 days after nerve lesion, PBR density and ODN-LI level were highly increased. Their expression returned to normal level when regeneration was completed 60 days after freeze-injury, but remained elevated when regeneration did not occur in transected distal stumps. Reverse-phase HPLC analysis of ODN-LI showed that in control nerve extracts, the major immunoreactive peak co-elutes with triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN). After freeze-injury, intermediate molecular forms eluting between ODN and TTN were predominant and remained elevated at day 60. The greater accumulation of intermediate forms when regeneration is allowed to occur may indicate a particular role of these forms in axonal elongation and myelination. Ro5-4864, a high affinity PBR agonist increased pregnenolone concentration in the sciatic nerve. This effect was antagonised by PK11195, a high affinity PBR antagonist, which had no effect on pregnenolone basal level, indicating a specific action of PBR in neurosteroid production. These results suggest a role for PBR and their endogenous ligands in peripheral nerve regeneration. A trophic effect could be exerted via stimulation of steroid synthesis.", 
    "6": "General anesthesia, applied under emergency conditions in both geriatric patients and patients presenting considerable in severity concomitant diseases (pulmonary and cardiovascular), is associated with serious risks in terms of restoring adequate consciousness, effective spontaneous respiration and pulmonary drainage, not infrequently requiring continuous mechanical ventilation of the patients. A procedure alternative to general anesthesia in abdominal surgery is described, consisting in the application of continuous thoracic epidural anesthesia (CTEDA), reaching i.v. thoracic segment, providing for analgesia of the whole abdomen and myorelaxation promoting accomplishment of the operative intervention against the background of preserved consciousness and spontaneous respiration. This is a report on 70 patients operated under CTEDA in the clinic of emergency surgery, University Hospital \"Queen Giovanna\"--Sofia, in the period June 1994 through April 1998. The methodology, superiorities and general organic effects of this particular type of anesthesia are comprehensively discussed. Emphasis is laid on the important role played by CTEDA in postoperative analgesia of patients in intensive care units, and on the contribution of the method to exclude any opiates, till recently considered as the most effective for pain relief in the post-operative period.", 
    "7": "The neurotoxic actions of kainate and domoate were studied in cultured murine neocortical neurons at various days in culture and found to be developmentally regulated involving three components of neurotoxicity: (1) toxicity via indirect activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, (2) toxicity mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors, and (3) toxicity that can be mediated by kainate receptors when desensitization of the receptors is blocked. The indirect action at NMDA receptors was discovered because (5R, 10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-im ine (MK-801), an NMDA receptor antagonist, was able to block part of the toxicity. The activation of NMDA receptors is most likely a secondary effect resulting from glutamate release upon kainate or domoate stimulation. 1-(4-Aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamyl-4-methyl-3,4-dihydro-7,8-ethyle nedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 53655), a selective AMPA receptor antagonist, abolished the remaining toxicity. These results indicated that kainate- and domoate-mediated toxicity involves both the NMDA and the AMPA receptors. Pretreatment of the cultures with concanavalin A to prevent desensitization of kainate receptors led to an increased neurotoxicity upon stimulation with kainate or domoate. In neurons cultured for 12 days in vitro a small but significant neurotoxic effect was observed when stimulated with agonist in the presence of MK-801 and GYKI 53655. This indicates that the toxicity is produced by kainate receptors in mature cultures. Examining the subunit expression of the kainate receptor subunits GluR6/7 and KA2 did, however, not reveal any major change during development of the cultures.", 
    "8": "A cholinergically disrupted laboratory animal has been produced by administration of the cholinotoxin ethylcholine aziridinium mustard (AF64A), which produced a dysfunction in the cholinergic forebrain system. After AF64A treatment, a reduction of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) activity was measured in the hippocampal regions. ChAT activity was preferentially reduced in tissue samples of the dorsal with respect to the ventral hippocampus, and concomitantly with this reduction, a compensatory increase in ChAT activity in the medial septum was found. Tissue gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content in the hippocampal and septal brain areas was not affected by AF64A, indicating a specific effect on the cholinergic septohippocampal projection. The rate of GABA accumulation induced by aminooxyacetic acid administration was higher in the dorsal hippocampus and medial septum of AF64A-treated animals, but not in their ventral hippocampus and lateral septum, where significant changes occurred in ChAT activity. Concomitantly with the changes in GABA metabolism, a significant Bmax increase and Kd reduction of 3H-flunitrazepam binding in the hippocampus of AF64A-treated animals were associated with changes in the ChAT activity. This finding suggests an increase of GABA input on the cholinergic somas of the medial septum and an uncompensated GABAergic interneuron activity in the hippocampus. In this study, we present an adaptive mechanism of homotypic compensatory metabolism by cholinergic somas, and a heterotypic response of the GABAergic septohippocampal projection system, which was elicited by AF64A administration.", 
    "9": "Drugs such as benzodiazepines, which enhance the effects of inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), are known to modulate the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system, which is considered to mediate the rewarding effects of psychostimulants. The effects of diazepam, a benzodiazepine that binds unspecifically to omega 1- (omega1-) and omega2-receptors, and zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine drug that binds preferentially to omega1-receptors, on cocaine- and amphetamine-induced place preference were evaluated in Wistar rats. In tests using the counterbalanced method, neither diazepam (0.2, 1, and 5 mg/kg) nor zolpidem (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) alone induced place preference or place aversion. Diazepam pretreatment prevented both cocaine- and amphetamine-induced (15 and 9 mg/kg, respectively) place preference; however, at doses that were earlier shown to cause sedation and amnesia, zolpidem failed to prevent either cocaine- or amphetamine-induced place preference. These results suggest that diazepam interferes with the rewarding properties of the psychostimulants, whereas zolpidem is less effective in this respect, possibly due to differential distribution of omega1- and omega2-receptors in the brain.", 
    "10": "To characterize the potential interaction between the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems, the effects of dizocilpine, CPP, and lorazepam on open-field behavior and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures were evaluated in mice. Dizocilpine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg), CPP (1-10 mg/kg), or vehicle was administered intraperitoneally 15 min prior to lorazepam (0.2-2 mg/kg) or vehicle. Behavioral monitoring began 25 min after the lorazepam injection. Upon completion of testing, unrestrained mice were infused intravenously with pentylenetetrazole until the onset of a full tonic-clonic seizure. The highest dose of dizocilpine by itself significantly increased the average distance traveled, the number of rears, and the number of stereotypies during the test period. Lorazepam alone dose dependently decreased activity on all behavioral parameters. Lorazepam also completely antagonized the hyperactivity produced by dizocilpine when the two compounds were coadministered. This antagonism is most likely due to an interaction in the regulation of dopaminergic tone which underlies motor activity. Lorazepam exerted a dose-dependent anticonvulsant effect. Dizocilpine alone had no effect on seizure induction and did not potentiate the anticonvulsive effect of lorazepam when coadministered with lorazepam. CPP reduced the number of rears and the number of stereotypies during the test period. CPP did not alter the pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure threshold and did not influence the anticonvulsant effect of lorazepam.", 
    "11": "Experiments were designed to investigate the influence of estrous cycle and gender of the rat on the effects of a gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor active neurosteroid, 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone), the benzodiazepine, triazolam, and a GABA(A) receptor antagonistic neurosteroid, delta5-androsten-3beta-ol-17-one sulfate (dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate), on food intake and elevated plus-maze learning behaviors. Allopregnanolone (0.25 mg/kg, s.c.) and triazolam (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a hyperphagic effect, while dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (5 mg/kg, s.c.) elicited an anorectic effect. However, allopregnanolone was more potent in diestrous females, whereas triazolam exhibited significantly higher hyperphagic potency in estrus females. The extent of anorexia following dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was alike in male and female rats. The triazolam- and allopregnanolone-induced hyperphagic effect was blocked by bicuculline (1 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective GABA(A) receptor antagonist. In contrast to triazolam, the hyperphagic effect of allopregnanolone was insensitive to flumazenil (5 mg/kg, i.p.), a benzodiazepine antagonist. Vehicle-treated diestrous rats displayed moderately higher latencies in the elevated plus-maze learning task than estrus or proestrus females. Although allopregnanolone and triazolam elicited equipotent learning deficits in plus-maze learning in male and female rats, the magnitude of impairment-induced by triazolam was significantly higher in diestrous females than proestrus females. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate enhanced memory performance only in male rats. Although the use of the elevated plus-maze as a learning paradigm with benzodiazepines and neurosteroids may be sensitive to changes in anxiety, the differential data suggest that neurosteroid-induced effects are at least partly specific to learning behavior. These results confirm the role of estrous cycle and sex of rats in modifying the potency of neurosteroids and benzodiazepines on food consumption and learning and memory processes.", 
    "12": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether acute stress exposure would alter the ataxic properties of midazolam or ethanol in rats. Rats were administered either vehicle or FG 7142 (10 mg/kg) and placed back in their home cages, or placed in restraining tubes for 90 min. Three and one-half or 24 h following injection all subjects were then administered an ataxic dose of either ethanol or midazolam and after 10 min, motoric impairment was assessed by rotarod performance. Neither FG 7142 administration nor restraint had an impact on rotarod performance 3-1/2 h later for ethanol nor 24 h later in response to midazolam. However, midazolam-induced ataxia was significantly modified 3-1/2 h following both restraint and FG 7142 exposure. Similarly, at the 24-h time point, both manipulations had a significant effect on ethanol-induced motor incoordination. Importantly, prior exposure to FG 7142 and restraint was without effect on rotarod performance in saline-treated subjects. Functional alterations in behavioral reactivity to low doses of two classes of CNS depressants by the acute stress of restraint and/or FG 7142 administration suggest the anxiogenic nature of these stressors may be the critical factor.", 
    "13": "Previous studies have shown that predatory odors are a potent anxiogenic stimulus for rodents, yet the ability of benzodiazepines to block odor-induced anxiety remains uncertain. The present study reevaluated this issue using a novel apparatus that, in contrast to previous studies, allowed rats to hide from the odor in a small wooden \"hide box\" placed within a larger arena. The odor stimulus used was a fabric cat collar that had been worn by a domestic cat for a period of 3 weeks. The experiment was divided into three phases on successive days: 1) habituation, where all rats were placed in the apparatus without cat odor present; 2) conditioning, where rats were presented with the cat odor in the apparatus; and 3) test, where rats previously exposed to the odor were tested for a conditioned avoidance response in the absence of the odor. Results showed that rats exposed to the cat collar displayed a robust avoidance response, spending about 70% of a 20-min session in the hide box compared to 25% in control rats. This avoidance response was completely reversed in rats given a low dose (0.375 mg/kg) of midazolam. During the test phase, rats exposed to the cat odor on the previous day showed elevated levels of hiding when returned to the test apparatus without the cat odor present. This conditioned avoidance was significantly attenuated in rats who had received midazolam (0.375 mg/kg) during cat odor exposure but not in rats given the same dose during the test. These results show that low-dose midazolam is an effective anxiolytic agent in rats during exposure to predatory odor.", 
    "14": "Since the introduction of benzodiacepines in the medical practice their use has been generalized to numerous clinical situations. One of them is schizophrenia. In this article we analize the main settings for its use and the possible mechanisms of action, trying to draw some recomendations applicable to the psychiatric practice.", 
    "15": "Prompt home treatment of dangerous seizures or upsetting relapses can prevent the effects of prolonged seizures and offer patients and their families an alternative to emergency medical treatment. The choice of benzodiazepine and route of administration should be based on patients' clinical presentation and acceptance. The challenge for the practitioner is to select the patients for whom home use of benzodiazepines will be appropriate, safe, and cost-effective.", 
    "16": "Effects of PK 11195 and flumazenil on cardiac responses to diazepam, clonazepam and zolpidem were compared. Coronary flow rate was increased at relatively low doses of diazepam and decreased at higher doses. Clonazepam induced a dose-dependent increase, and zolpidem a decrease of coronary flow rate. PK 11195 reduced the diazepam-induced increase of coronary flow rate, and flumazenil was ineffective. Neither antagonist evoked substantial changes in the decrease of coronary flow rate. PK 11195, and less so flumazenil, antagonized the clonazepam-induced increase. PK 11195 and flumazenil only in their highest doses suppressed and respectively potentiated the zolpidem-induced decrease. Inotropy showed a biphasic response in the presence of diazepam, i.e. an initial transient decrease, followed by a dose-dependent increase in two steps. Clonazepam induced a similar response. Zolpidem increased the inotropy. The negative inotropic response induced by diazepam did not change significantly in the presence of PK 11195 or flumazenil. The positive inotropic response was suppressed by PK 11195, and less so by flumazenil. The negative response to clonazepam was antagonized by both PK 11195 and flumazenil; the positive response was not significantly changed. In the presence of lower doses of PK 11195, the zolpidem-induced response was potentiated, whereas higher doses produced reversal; flumazenil potentiated the response. In conclusion, the results support earlier suggestions, involving receptor mechanisms with cardiac effects of benzodiazepines. Both agonists and antagonists (inter)act in a different manner, suggesting that rather ambiguous receptor mechanisms are involved in benzodiazepine effects in the heart.", 
    "17": "Some types of mood disorders and drugs are suggested to affect peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR), but their mechanisms are unclear. The isolation of pure lymphocytes is requisite for the investigation of the function of PBR on lymphocytes, since platelets and monocytes also have many PBR. The objective of this study was to establish a method of binding assay for PBR using pure T lymphocytes. Mononuclear cells and T lymphocytes were prepared by using a density gradient material and magnetic beads, respectively. The cells were analyzed using flow cytometry and a counting chamber. Binding studies were performed using T lymphocytes from 10 normal volunteers. The T lymphocytes were incubated with [3H]PK11195, harvested on glass fiber filters, and counted with a plate scintillation counter. The binding data were analyzed by the Scatchard method. With the magnetic bead technique, pure T cells were selected that contained only 1.5% monocytes and platelet/cell ratio of 1.4. The Scatchard plot of the data indicated that only one type of specific binding site was involved in the binding. The dissociation constant (Kd) was 3.8+/-1.3nM (mean+/-SD), and the Bmax was 379+/-124 fmol//10(6) cells (mean+/-SD). The density gradient- magnetic beads technique can be used as an appropriate method of preparation of T cells for PBR binding assay.",

A median (range) of four (one to four) blood samples, 0.2 ml each, were drawn at random times after the first dose or during continuous treatment, and concentrations of midazolam in serum were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. A population analysis was conducted using a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model using the NONMEM program.",

Inasmuch as some positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptor function exhibit profound interactions with ethanol, the effects of 3alpha,5alpha-P and 3alpha,5beta-P were compared to those of two benzodiazepines, triazolam and diazepam, on the motor function of mice and rats when administered either alone or in combination with ethanol. All four test compounds exhibited dose-related impairment of motor function in the horizontal wire task in mice and the rotorod task in rats. Ethanol caused a marked enhancement of triazolamand diazepam-induced motor impairment. In contrast, ethanol enhanced to a lesser extent the motor impairment induced by both neurosteroids in mice and not at all in rats. All four compounds increased ethanol-induced behavioral sleep time in mice, although the benzodiazepines did so at a much smaller fraction of their ataxic doses as compared to the neurosteroids. As one of the undesired side-effects of therapeutic use of benzodiazepines is their interaction with ethanol, development of neuroactive steroids as drugs may offer therapeutic advantages.",

Late positive potentials (P300-like potentials) from the cortex (Pz) and hippocampus recorded using the auditory oddball paradigm in combination with electrical reinforcement can be measured in rhesus monkeys. The latency of this P300-like potential recorded from the monkey cortex was 330 ms, and the amplitude was 13 microV. It was prolonged in both the cortex (Pz) and hippocampus by SC injection of 10 microg/kg scopolamine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Oral administration of S-8510 (3, 10 mg/kg) had no effect on the latency in normal monkeys. However, S-8510 reversed the scopolamine-induced prolongation of P300-like potentials on the cortex (Pz) and hippocampus. These results show that S-8510 can attenuate the effects induced by scopolamine on P300-like potentials associated with cognitive function in monkeys, suggesting that S-8510 may be useful as a therapeutic drug in disease-associated cognitive dysfunctions of the central nervous system.", 
    "24": "Increased extracellular glutamate levels are related to glial and neuronal damage. Glutamate-mediated toxicity is limited by glial uptake and metabolic transformation of glutamate to glutamine and the energetic compounds alanine and lactate which are utilized by surrounding neurons. Under in vitro conditions, barbiturates have been shown to reduce glutamate uptake and its further metabolism, possibly impeding metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons. The aims were to investigate if under clinical conditions, the barbiturate thiopental reduces important detoxification of glutamate, resulting in lower CSF glutamine, alanine and lactate levels as opposed to patients receiving midazolam. During long-term administration of thiopental and midazolam, pathologically elevated ventricular CSF glutamate levels were associated with significantly increased glutamine and alanine levels up to 14 days after trauma. CSF lactate, however, remained normal. These data suggest that long-term administration of thiopental and midazolam under clinical conditions does not impede enzymatic activities responsible for detoxification and metabolism of glutamate.", 
    "25": "Recent uncontrolled research suggested that trazodone and sodium valproate may be helpful in benzodiazepine (BZ) discontinuation. We therefore undertook a double-blind study to assess whether trazodone and valproate, as compared to placebo, would attenuate withdrawal and facilitate discontinuation in BZ-dependent patients with a minimum of 1 year daily BZ use. Seventy-eight patients, taking a mean dose of 19+/-17 mg/day of diazepam (or its equivalent), were stabilized for several weeks on their BZ (16 diazepam, 25 lorazepam, 37 alprazolam) and then for 1-2 weeks, pretreated with trazodone, sodium valproate or placebo before being tapered at 25% per week. All treatments were continued for 5 weeks post-taper. BZ-free status was assessed after 5 and 12 weeks post-taper. Neither trazodone nor valproate had any significant effect on withdrawal severity. Peak physician withdrawal checklist change from baseline to peak severity was 16.4 for trazodone, 18.04 sodium valproate and 18.24 placebo (F = 0.10; NS). Taper success rates were significantly effected by both active agents at the 5-week, but not 12-week, assessment. At 5 weeks post-taper, 79% of sodium valproate and 67% of trazodone, but only 31% of placebo patients were BZ-free (chi2 = 7.34; df 2; P<0.03).

Compared with vehicle, picrotoxin significantly delayed the latency to non-rapid eye movement sleep (non-REMS) and thereby decreased all sleep states, but barely affected the EEG activity within non-REMS. Progesterone significantly shortened non-REMS latency, increased pre-REMS, depressed low-frequency EEG activity (< or = 8 Hz) and augmented EEG activity in the higher frequencies within non-REMS. Except for the changes in high-frequency EEG activity, picrotoxin attenuated all effects of progesterone. These findings support the notion that GABA(A) receptors play an important role in the sleep effects of progesterone.", 
    "27": "Anxiolytic drugs generally produce anticonflict effects in both pigeons and rats, although relatively few anxiolytics have been examined in the pigeon and the procedure has not been as completely validated as the rat model. In this study, we examined the antipunishment effects of a variety of benzodiazepine agonists in pigeons and compared the relationship between their potencies to engender anxiolytic-like effects and their clinical doses in humans. In pigeons whose responding was maintained under a multiple FR30food:FR30food+shock schedule, the benzodiazepine agonists diazepam, flunitrazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, flurazepam, bromazepam, medazepam, and clorazepate produced dose-related increases in punished responding, and, with the exception of medazepam, decreased unpunished responding at higher doses. Potencies calculated from the percentage of pigeons showing significant increases in punished responding ranged from 0.081 to 11 mg/kg, and these potencies were invariably lower than those for decreases in unpunished responding by factors ranging from 2.2 to more than 14. The comparison of relative potencies of benzodiazepine receptor agonists in pigeons and humans revealed a high positive correlation (0.90, P<0.005), thus demonstrating the predictive validity of this preclinical animal model for anxiolytic benzodiazepines. The results agree with previous findings of robust anticonflict effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists and extend further the pharmacological characterization to compounds that have not been examined previously in pigeons.",

For the quantification of striatal D2 receptor occupancy, striatal IBZM binding in patients treated with antipsychotics was compared to that in untreated healthy controls (n = 8) reported earlier. Olanzapine led to a mean striatal D2 receptor occupancy rate of 75% (range 63-85). Haloperidol-treated patients showed dose-dependently (Pearson r = 0.64; P < 0.05) a significantly higher (P < 0.05) mean occupancy rate of 84% (range 67-94). During clozapine treatment, the mean D2 receptor occupancy of 33% (range < 20-49) was significantly lower than with olanzapine (P < 0.005). The higher striatal D2 receptor occupancy of haloperidol was correlated with the incidence and severity of extrapyramidal motor side-effects (EPS). No clinical relevant EPS occurred during treatment with olanzapine or clozapine. There was no correlation between the degree of striatal D2 receptor occupancy and clinical improvement.",

Given alone [4 ml intragastrically (ig)] Pro (1.0 g), AA (1.0 g), CHO (1.4 g), and Fat (2.4 g) suppressed (P < 0.05) food intake on average during the first 2 h of feeding by 1.4 (36%), 1.5 (48%), 1.0 (33%), and 1.2 g (41%), respectively. Devazepide (0.5 mg/kg) and PD-140,548 (1.0 mg/kg) given alone increased food intake during 0-2 h by 0.7 g (18%) and during 0-1 h by 0.5 g (15%), respectively. When coadministered with PD-140,548 (1.0 mg/kg ip), the suppression of food intake caused by Pro was modulated during 0-2 h by 57% (Pro x drug interaction, P < 0.05), but AA-, CHO-, and Fat-induced suppression of feeding was not affected (nutrient x drug interaction, P > 0.05). Devazepide (0.5 mg/kg ip) did not modulate AA-, CHO-, and Fat-induced food intake suppression during any time period (nutrient x drug interaction, P > 0.05). These studies provide additional evidence that CCK-A receptors play a role in Pro (albumin) but not AA-, CHO (cornstarch)-, or Fat (corn oil)-induced food intake suppression in rats.", 
    "42": "Fat in small intestine decreases meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and slows gastric emptying. CCK is a mediator of this inhibitory effect (an enterogastrone). Because intravenously administered peptide YY (PYY) inhibits acid secretion, endogenous PYY released by fat may also be an enterogastrone. Four dogs were equipped with gastric, duodenal, and midgut fistulas. PYY antibody (anti-PYY) at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg or CCK-A receptor antagonist (devazepide) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg was administered alone or in combination 10 min before the proximal half of the gut was perfused with 60 mM oleate or buffer. Acid secretion and gastric emptying were measured. We found that 1) peptone-induced gastric acid secretion was inhibited by intestinal fat (P < 0.0001), 2) inhibition of acid secretion by intestinal fat was reversed by CCK-A receptor antagonist (P < 0.0001) but not by anti-PYY, and 3) slowing of gastric emptying by fat was reversed by CCK-A antagonist (P < 0. 05) but not by anti-PYY. We concluded that inhibition of peptone meal-induced gastric acid secretion and slowing of gastric emptying by intestinal fat depended on CCK but not on circulating PYY.",

The effects of pretreatment with various drugs on acetylcholine (ACh) release and contractile responses induced by electrical field stimulation were evaluated. Although atropine (a muscarinic nonselective antagonist) and 4-DAMP (a muscarinic M3 antagonist) did not influence the ACh release, they markedly reduced the contractile responses. Pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) decreased ACh release and contractile responses. Methoctramine (M2 antagonist) increased the ACh release, but did not influence to the contractile responses. These results suggest that the muscarinic receptors in the rabbit detrusor smooth muscle are heterogeneous, prejunctional facilitatory (M1 receptors), and inhibitory (M2 receptors) for ACh release and postjunctional M3 receptors mediating contractile responses.", 
    "44": "A systemic administration of cholecystokinin (CCK) increases gastric vagal afferent activity via type A CCK receptors (CCKAR). In the present study, the response of gastric vagal afferent activity to an intravenous administration of CCK was investigated in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, which lack CCKAR, and compared with its control strain, Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats. The intravenous administration of 300 pmol kg(-1) and 3 nmol kg(-1) of CCK elicited dose-dependent increases in the gastric vagal afferent activity in LETO rats. The responses were not influenced by the pretreatment with L-365,260, a type B CCK receptor (CCKBR) antagonist, while they were significantly diminished by pretreatment with MK-329, a CCKAR antagonist. After pretreatment with MK-329, 3 nmol kg(-1) (but not 300 pmol kg(-1)) of CCK still elicited a small but significant increase in the activity. In the OLETF rats, both 300 pmol kg(-1) and 3 nmol kg(-1) of CCK produced small increases in the vagal afferent activity, and the responses were not influenced by pretreatment with either L-365,260 or MK-329. In addition, the systemic administration of CCK did not change gastric motility in the OLETF rats, indicating that the response of the vagal afferent activity in OLETF rats was independent of the gastric motility change. These results demonstrate that neither CCKAR nor CCKBR contributes to the response of the afferent activity of the gastric vagal nerve to a systemic administration of CCK in OLETF rats, suggesting an involvement of novel (non-A, non-B) CCK receptors.", 
    "45": "Olanzapine's structural similarities to clozapine and the results of premarketing clinical trials suggested potential usefulness in treating patients with treatment-refractory psychoses. Sixteen inpatients from the state hospital with severe, refractory schizophrenic or schizoaffective psychoses received olanzapine in a prospective, 12-week, open-label trial. The olanzapine dose was 10 mg/day for at least the first 6 weeks and never exceeded 20 mg/day. Mood stabilizers and other antipsychotic agents were discontinued before olanzapine was started. Patients frequently became more agitated within the first several weeks of initiating treatment, requiring the increased use of benzodiazepines and often leading to the discontinuation of olanzapine. Two patients improved significantly. Overall, significant clinical improvement was noted only for motor side effects. This study concluded that olanzapine was not effective in this heterogeneous group with chronic, severe, treatment-resistant psychosis when used in this manner. Further research is needed to explain the tendency toward agitation upon transition to olanzapine, which is reminiscent of reported risperidone complications. Clinicians should be alert for this complication and should minimize concomitant medication changes that might add to the risk of emergent agitation.",

Eight patients with principal diagnoses (DSM-IV) of autistic disorder (N = 5) or PDD not otherwise specified (N = 3) were given olanzapine in an open-label, prospective fashion for 12 weeks. Clinical ratings were obtained at baseline and at the end of weeks (EOWs) 4, 8, and 12. Seven of eight patients completed the 12-week trial, and six of the completers were deemed clinical responders as measured by ratings at the EOW 12 of \"much improved\" or \"very much improved\" on the global improvement item of the Clinical Global Impression Scale. Significant improvements in overall symptoms of autism, motor restlessness or hyperactivity, social relatedness, affectual reactions, sensory responses, language usage, self-injurious behavior, aggression, irritability or anger, anxiety, and depression were observed. Significant changes in repetitive behaviors were not observed for the group. The EOW 12 mean +/- SD daily dose of olanzapine was 7.8 +/- 4.7 mg/day. The drug was well tolerated with the most significant adverse effects noted to be increased appetite and weight gain in six patients and sedation in three. With respect to weight gain, the mean +/- SD weight for the group increased from 137.50 +/- 55.81 pounds (62.50 +/- 25.37 kilograms) at baseline to 155.94 +/- 55.13 pounds (70.88 +/- 25.06 kilograms) at EOW 12. No evidence of extrapyramidal side effects or liver function abnormalities was seen. These preliminary results suggest that olanzapine may be an effective and well tolerated drug in targeting core and related symptoms of PDDs in children, adolescents, and adults.

    "68": "5-Hydroxytryptamine 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors share many properties, including a common ability to stimulate phospholipase C. Traditionally, this activation was thought to be initiated only after agonist binding, in accordance with the ternary complex model of receptor function. Recently, though, the 5-HT2C receptor was shown to deviate from this tenet by spontaneously isomerizing into the active receptor state, thereby activating G proteins in the absence of agonist. To determine if 5-HT2A receptors share this property of constitutive activity, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor function was evaluated in transiently transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. In 3T3 cells expressing 5-HT2C receptors, agonist-independent phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis was substantially elevated relative to mock-transfected cells. In contrast, expression of the 5-HT2A receptor at the same density caused only a marginal increase in basal signaling. Control experiments in the current and previous papers establish that basal activity does not reflect contaminating serotonin. In addition, the magnitude of serotonin-induced signaling was the same in cells expressing either receptor, suggesting that the intrinsic ability of the two receptors to couple to G proteins is comparable. These data indicate that the 5-HT2A receptor has a much lower intrinsic ability to spontaneously adopt or maintain the active receptor conformation than does the closely related 5-HT2C receptor.",

Non-amidated biosynthetic intermediates may exert biological effects through other mechanisms, but their effect on gastric acid secretion is unclear. Amidated gastrins stimulate acid secretion mainly by releasing histamine from mucosal enterochromaffin-like cells. This study examines the effects on histamine release from the vascularly perfused rat stomach of amidated gastrin-17, COOH-terminal glycine-extended gastrin-17, gastrin-17 extended at the COOH-terminal including the remaining progastrin sequence, and carboxy-terminal progastrin fragments (SAEDEN and GRRSAEDEN). Carboxy-terminal extended gastrins induced histamine release which was inhibited by the gastrin/CCK(B) antagonist L-740,093, but had to be given in concentrations 100-fold higher than amidated gastrin-17 to produce comparable effects.

The anxiolytics decreased anxiety and reduced the theta-rhythm frequency in all the structures under study. The effect was most pronounced in the dorsal hippocampus. The excitable dogs with initially more frequent theta rhythm turned to be less sensitive to diazepam than more calm animals with prevailing inhibition. The higher dose of diazepam was necessary for excitable dogs to obtain the same electrophysiological effect. At the end of the drug action, the theta-rhythm power significantly increased in the dorsal hippocampus in all the animals, and in the excitable dogs it increased also in the frontal cortex. Moreover, diazepam produced as decrease in the beta 2-frequency and increase in the frequency of the alpha-like rhythm. The anxiogen intake resulted in an increase in dogs' alertness and motor activity, accompanied by an increase in the theta-rhythm frequency.

The effect of two antifungal agents commonly implicated in CYP3A drug-drug interactions was examined. Inhibition type and affinities were determined for human liver and intestinal microsomes screened for the presence or absence of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, as well as for cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 microsomes. Ketoconazole and fluconazole were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors of both enzymes. Ketoconazole exhibited a Ki for cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 of 26. 7 +/- 1.71 nM, whereas the Ki for cDNA expressed CYP3A5 was 109 +/- 19.7 nM. Corresponding Ki values for fluconazole were 9.21 +/- 0.51 microM and 84.6 +/- 12.9 microM. For liver and intestinal microsomes that contained only CYP3A4, the average ketoconazole Ki was found to be 14.9 +/- 6.7 nM and 17.0 +/- 7.9 nM, respectively, whereas fluconazole yielded mean respective Ki values of 10.7 +/- 4.2 microM and 10.4 +/- 2.9 microM. Liver and intestinal microsomes that contained an equal or greater amount of CYP3A5, in addition to CYP3A4, were less susceptible to inhibition by both ketoconazole and fluconazole. These findings suggest that there can be significant differences in the affinity of these two enzymes for inhibitors. This may further broaden interindividual variability with respect to the magnitude of in vivo drug-drug interactions. We also conclude that there is no significant difference in inhibition type and affinity of ketoconazole and fluconazole for hepatic versus intestinal CYP3A4.",

Nine age- and sex-matched volunteers who were free of mental illness served as controls. Patients with panic disorder showed a significant increase of benzodiazepine receptor binding in the right supraorbital cortex and a trend to an increased uptake in the right temporal cortex. There was no correlation between receptor density and scores on Spielberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory in the patient group.

    "80": "The effect of triazolam, a potent benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist, on muscarinic acetylcholinergic receptor (mAChR) binding was investigated in living brain slices by use of a novel positron-based imaging technique. Fresh rat brain slices were incubated with [11C]N-methyl-4-piperidylbenzilate ([11C]NMPB), a mAChR antagonist, in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution at 37 degrees C. During incubation, time-resolved imaging of [11C]NMPB binding in the slices was constructed on the storage phosphor screens. Addition of triazolam (1 microM) plus muscimol (30 microM), a GABA(A) receptor agonist, to the incubation mixture decreased the specific binding of [11C]NMPB. Ro15-1788, a BZ receptor antagonist, prevented this effect, indicating that the effect was exerted through the GABA(A)/BZ receptor complex. These results demonstrated that stimulation of the GABA(A)/BZ receptor lowers the affinity of the mAChR for its ligand, which may underlie the BZ-induced amnesia, a serious clinical side effect of BZ. No such effect in the P2-fraction instead implies that the integrity of the neuronal cells and/or their environment is prerequisite for the modulation of mAChR by GABA(A)/BZ stimulation.",

Hemostatic complications developed after surgery, with extreme thrombopenia (1,000 platelets/pl) and analytical changes that necessitated administration of six units of platelets from apheresis, as well as immunoglobulins, antifibrinolytic agents (e-aminocaproic acid) and granulocytic colony stimulating factors. Anesthesia for such patients is reviewed, with emphasis on careful management of the airways, preparation of sufficient material for surgery (rapid transfusion equipment, large caliber intravenous catheters, sterile material) and orientation of anesthetic technique toward general anesthesia through a laryngeal mask.",

Prevalence of benzodiazepines in women in twice that in men, and incidence of hypnotics is slightly higher in women. Prevalence and incidence of hypnotics are strongly associated with increasing age. There were high proportions of long-term users (61 and 70%), and continued use was high (52%) among new users. A large proportion of benzodiazepine use was by those who were concurrently depressed. Similarly, anxiety predicted both current and subsequent use of hypnotics.",

    "87": "4-Dimethylamino-4'-(imidazol-1-yl)chalcone (RL3142) is a newly developed antimalarial cysteine protease inhibitor. Four metabolites (M1-M4) were found in human liver microsomes and their structures were identified by LC/MS/MS. Two primary metabolites, M2 (minor) and M4 (major), were determined to be the N-demethylated product (M2) and the product (M4) resulting from 1,2-hydrogenation of the alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone moiety of the parent compound. A combined approach utilizing selective P450 inhibitors, immunoinhibition with CYP3A and NADPH P450 reductase antibodies, and cDNA expressed human CYP3A4 and NADPH P450 reductase, was used for identification of enzymes responsible for the biotransformation. For formation of M2, both a rabbit CYP3A polyclonal antibody (110 microliter/mg microsomal protein) and ketoconazole (2 micromol/l), a CYP3A inhibitor, showed about 50% inhibitory effects; other specific inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 showed no significant effects. For formation of M4, neither CYP3A antibody nor the above mentioned CYP inhibitors exhibited inhibitory effects. Anti-rat NADPH P450 reductase serum (50 microliter/100 microgram microsomal protein) exhibited 70 and 58% inhibitory effects on M2 and M4 formation, respectively. Incubation of RL3142 with cDNA expressed human NADPH P450 reductase yielded formation of M4, but not M2. Carbon monoxide inhibited formation of M2 and M1 (the reduced product of M2), but had no effect on M4 and M3 (the reduced product of M4) formation. Collectively, NADPH P450 reductase solely catalyzed reduction of RL3142 to M4, whereas CYP3A contributed in part to formation of M2.", 
    "88": "Although the precise mechanism whereby cholesterol is transported across the outer mitochondrial membrane is uncertain, a multimeric receptor complex termed the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) appears essential for this process. We therefore predicted that adrenal cells at different developmental stages would express PBR coincidentally with the advent of steroidogenesis. Adrenals of neonatal rats demonstrate greatly reduced sensitivity to ACTH that gradually increases after the first 2 weeks of life. Thus, neonates have lower circulating corticosterone levels following exposure to stress. We examined mitochondrial PBR ligand binding activity, immunoreactive (ir) PBR content, and adrenal sensitivity to ACTH in vivo and in vitro. Ontogeny of both mitochondrial PBR ligand binding capacity and irPBR directly paralleled that of ACTH-inducible steroidogenesis in isolated rat adrenal cells and in rats injected with ACTH. In addition, neonatal PBR had approximately 2-fold higher affinity for PK11195, a synthetic ligand that binds with high affinity to PBR. No correlation was observed during neonatal life between ir-steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein content and steroidogenesis. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PBR is an absolute prerequisite for adrenocortical steroidogenesis, and suggest that the stress hyporesponsive period of neonatal rats may result from decreased PBR expression. In addition, the higher affinity of neonatal PBR and the relatively high basal expression of StAR protein in neonatal adrenals may partly explain the high constitutive steroidogenesis characteristic of neonatal rat adrenal cells.", 
    "89": "Three groups of amygdala-kindled rats received 10 bidaily treatment trials: On each trial, the drug-before group received a diazepam (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) injection 1 hr before a convulsive stimulation, the drug-after group received a diazepam injection 1 hr after a stimulation, and the vehicle control group received a vehicle injection either 1 hr before or 1 hr after a stimulation. After treatment, only the drug-before group displayed significantly longer forelimb clonus under the influence of diazepam (that is, they displayed contingent tolerance to diazepam's anticonvulsant effect) and significantly longer forelimb clonus while drug free. Following a 14-day retention period, the rats in the drug-before group retained significant levels of contingent tolerance but did not display significant increases when tested drug free. These data suggest that compensatory responses do not play a causal role in the expression of contingent tolerance.", 
    "90": "Rats with extensive lesions of cortical cholinergic afferents as a result of infusions of 192 IgG-saporin into the basal forebrain show persistent impairments in sustained attention performance (J. McGaughy, T. Kaiser, & M. Sarter, 1996). However, the administration of neither the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine nor the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist FG 7142 attenuated the lesion-induced impairments in performance. The present study demonstrated that less extensive cortical cholinergic deafferentation, produced by intracortical infusions of a relatively small concentration of 192 IgG-saporin, resulted in a significant impairment in sustained attention. However, the administration of neither physostigmine (0.01-0.1 mg/kg) nor FG 7142 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) benefited the performance of the animals. Because neither compound selectively augments performance-associated increases in acetylcholine release from residual neurons, beneficial effects on cortical cholinergic deafferentation-based impairments in attention may remain limited.",

    "97": "This clinical trial was conducted to compare the anticonvulsant response of magnesium sulphate and diazepam in the management of eclampsia. The study was carried out at the eclampsia unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital during the period from October, 1995 to January, 1996. Two hundred consecutive admitted patients were recruited for the study and randomly assigned to two treatment groups: magnesium sulphate and diazepam. One hundred patients received injection magnesium sulphate and another one hundred received injection diazepam. All patients of both the group were matched for baseline characteristics. Convulsion was controlled in 95% of the patients of magnesium sulphate group and 74% of the patients of diazepam group (p < .0005). The mean controlling time is also significantly lower in magnesium sulphate group than diazepam group (8.50 hours vs 9.39 hours). Patients of magnesium sulphate group regain consciousness much earlier (mean time 20.62 hrs.) than the patients of diazepam group (mean time 40.62 hrs.). No significant difference was observed in controlling blood pressure and foetal outcome. The study finding shows that magnesium sulphate has some advantage over diazepam in controlling convulsion and regaining consciousness. If magnesium sulphate can be made available in the market by local production it may be recommended to use this drug in the primary health care without any hazzard before referring to other hospital.", 
    "98": "The mitochondrion imports and processes the vast majority of the proteins that constitute its structural elements and metabolic pathways. To study mitochondrial precursor processing in the context of the cellular environment, we employed the baculovirus expression system to overexpress the prototypical precursor protein, human manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase (hMn-SOD). It was found that superoxide produced by hyperoxic culture conditions (95% O2 atm) or the redox cycling agent paraquat caused a lesion of the import/processing of precursor hMn-SOD in the baculovirus model. The oxidation of key sulfhydryl groups as a component of the mitochondrial processing lesion was implicated by the observation that the sulfhydryl reducing agent dithiothreitol was completely effective in preventing the block of hMn-SOD processing induced by paraquat. Interestingly, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBzR) agonists PK11194, Ro5-4864, and protoporphyrin IX were all found to enhance mitochondrial processing of the hMn-SOD precursor protein, suggesting a role for the PBzR in the regulation of mitochondrial import of proteins. Collectively, our results suggest a possible redox-regulated mechanism of mitochondrial protein import that may lead to less efficient precursor protein uptake by mitochondria under severely oxidizing conditions.", 
    "99": "Antagonists of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa are a promising class of antithrombotic agents offering potential advantages over present antiplatelet agents (i.e., aspirin and ticlopidine). Novel tricyclic nonpeptidal GPIIb/IIIa antagonists have been prepared and evaluated in vitro as antagonists of fibrinogen binding to the purified GPIIb/IIIa receptor and as inhibitors of platelet aggregation. The work presented demonstrates the robustness of the benzodiazepinedione (BZDD) scaffold, which can be functionalized at the N1-C2 amide as well as at C7, to provide structural diversity and allow optimization of the physiochemical and pharmacological properties of the BZDD based GPIIb/IIIa antagonists. In addition, the resulting new class of tricyclic GPIIb/IIIa antagonists could be used to probe for additional binding interactions on the GPIIb/IIIa receptor and perhaps lead to BZDD based GPIIb/IIIa antagonists with increased potency. The tricyclic molecules reported herein demonstrate that a heterocyclic ring can be fused to the benzodiazepinedione scaffold with retention of anti-aggregatory potency and in the case of tetrazole 30i, increased potency relative to the bicyclic analogue 1c.", 
    "100": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (pBZD-R; also called the omega-3 receptor or the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor) seems to play a critical role in the production of neurosteroids, which are able to alter the electrical properties of neuronal membranes and thus the firing patterns of neurons. Putative endogenous ligands are the diazepam-binding inhibitor and its processing products, as well as porphyrins, some of them, in the case of porphyria, are well known to give rise to certain aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenic-like symptoms. Previous findings of altered benzodiazepine binding sites in post-mortem brain samples and platelets from small samples of schizophrenic patients have been inconclusive. Therefore we investigated characteristic binding parameters (Bmax, Kd) of the granulocytic pBZD-R by using the selective ligand PK11.195 in 53 subjects, fulfilling ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria of schizophrenia. The binding parameters in our total group of 53 schizophrenic patients did not differ from those in healthy subjects. However, Bmax values were significantly reduced in schizophrenic patients with predominantly negative symptoms (residual type) compared to schizophrenic patients with predominantly positive symptoms, i.e. paranoid (-50%) and catatonic subtype (-38%). Moreover, only residual type schizophrenics exhibited a significantly reduced binding capacity compared to healthy subjects (-38%). More studies are warranted to clarify the functional significance of this binding site in the pathogenesis of negative symptoms.", 
    "101": "We have demonstrated that continuous administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-Ag) suppresses luteal steroidogenesis in the pregnant rat. We further demonstrated that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) play key roles in cholesterol transport leading to steroidogenesis. The purpose of this study was to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the suppression of luteal steroidogenesis leading to a fall in serum progesterone levels in GnRH-Ag-treated rats during early pregnancy. Pregnant rats were treated individually starting on day 8 of pregnancy with 5 microgram/day GnRH-Ag using an osmotic minipump. Sham-operated control rats received no treatment. At 0, 4, 8 and 24 h after initiation of the treatment, rats were killed and corpora lutea (CL) were removed for PBR mRNA, protein and radioligand binding analyses, immunoblot 1-D gel analysis of StAR, P450 scc and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase as well as 2-D gel analysis of StAR. The treatment decreased the luteal PBR mRNA expression at all time periods starting at 4 h compared with that in corresponding sham controls. GnRH-Ag also reduced, in the CL, the PBR protein/ligand binding, the StAR protein and P450 scc protein and its activity as early as 8 h after the treatment and they remained low compared with those in corresponding sham controls. The data from 2-D gel studies suggest that the majority of the decrease in StAR protein appears to be in the phosphorylated forms of StAR. Thus, we have demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of PBR and StAR in the pregnant rat CL and that the coordinated suppression of these proteins involved in the mitochondrial cholesterol transport along with P450 scc by GnRH-Ag leads to reduced ovarian steroidogenesis.",

On day 6, 10 mg buspirone was taken orally. Plasma concentrations of buspirone and its active metabolite, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP), were measured up to 18 h and the pharmacodynamic effects of buspirone up to 8 h.", 
    "104": "The total area under the plasma buspirone concentration-time curve was increased 2.4-fold (P < 0.05) and the peak plasma buspirone concentration 2.0-fold (P < 0.05) by fluvoxamine, compared with placebo. The half-life of buspirone was not affected. The ratio of the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 1-PP to that of buspirone was decreased from 7.4 [6.3 (SD)] to 4.4 (3.6) by fluvoxamine (P < 0.05). The results of the six pharmacodynamic tests remained unchanged.", 
    "105": "Fluvoxamine moderately increased plasma buspirone concentrations and decreased the production of the active 1-PP metabolite of buspirone. The mechanism of this interaction is probably inhibition of the CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of buspirone by fluvoxamine. However, this pharmacokinetic interaction was not associated with impairment of psychomotor performance and it is probably of limited clinical significance.", 
    "106": "A \"free choice\" two-bottle drinking test paradigm was implemented in naive adult male Wistar rats, resulting in a clear identification of rats drinking mainly water (water-preferring, WP rats) and rats spontaneously drinking also a consistent amount of a solution of cocaine (0.5 mg/ml water, cocaine-drinking, CD rats) or ethanol 10% v/v (ethanol-drinking, ED rats). Low, selective doses (5 micrograms/kg) of the specific cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor antagonist L-364,718 largely reduced the intake of ethanol 10% of ED rats only. In contrast, low, selective doses of GV-150013 (5 micrograms/kg) reduced significantly the consumption of cocaine of CD rats only. These results indicate that the CCK-A or B receptors are selectively involved in the modulation of alcohol or cocaine intake, respectively, and suggest an involvement of the CCKergic system in the drug-seeking behavior. WP rats and CD rats were then prepared for ex vivo electro-neurochemical analysis by means of differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with micro-biosensors to monitor catechol, 5-hydroxyindole and peptidergic oxidation signals in the nucleus accumbens (nAcc). In this area, the peptidergic signal appeared to be related to the oxidation of endogenous CCK, which basal levels resulted higher in ED and CD rats than WP rats. Thus, the hypothesis that the endogenous tone of the CCK system is higher in the ED and CD rats than in the WP rats is proposed, and is supported by the observation that treatment with CCK-5 (CCK receptor agonist) selectively induced the WP rats to drink alcohol or cocaine. The selective effect of the CCK-antagonists on reducing the drug intake of ED or CD rats further supports this view, as it suggests that CCK antagonists may modify the individual sensitivity towards drugs of abuse set by the stimulating effect of high endogenous CCKergic tone over CCK-B or CCK-A receptors in spontaneous ED or CD rats, respectively. Therefore, the present data indicate that: i) Free-choice models may reveal the presence of individual sensitivity to alcohol or cocaine in naive rats; ii) the dopaminergic system is involved within the reward state, while peptidergic (CCKergic) activities modulate the drug-seeking state (craving state); iii) the CCK system could be a new target in the study of the drug dependency phenomenon. In particular, the data imply a CCK-A receptor mechanism in the regulation of individual sensitivity towards ethanol and a CCK-B receptor mechanism in the regulation of individual sensitivity towards cocaine. Thus, a potential therapeutic role for CCK-A antagonists in the treatment of ethanol abuse and for CCK-B antagonists in the treatment of cocaine abuse is proposed.", 
    "107": "Animal research has shown that anxiety may inhibit pain through the release of endogenous opioids. On the other hand, anxiety is often believed to exacerbate pain in clinical situations, and anxiety reduction has been shown to attenuate the affective component of pain. In the present study phobic anxiety was induced by confronting forty-eight spider phobic subjects with a spider, after which they received two mildly painful electrical stimuli at two different current levels. The benzodiazepine alprazolam (1 mg) was administered to investigate the influence on pain of a reduction in anxiety, while the role of endogenous opioids was studied by administering the opioid antagonist naltrexone (50 mg). Alprazolam resulted in lower anxiety and pain ratings during pain stimulation, supporting the idea that (presumably pain-related) anxiety may increase the experience of pain. Naltrexone did not influence pain and anxiety ratings, nor was there a significant interaction between the two pharmacological manipulations. These findings confirm previous evidence that phobic fear does not necessarily induce an endogenous opioid-mediated analgesia.",

All four muscarinic receptor antagonists reduced tremulous jaw movements in a dose-dependent manner, with the following rank order of potency: scopolamine > methoctramine > or = telenzepine > pirenzepine. This pattern is inconsistent with the rank order of affinity of these agents at the muscarinic M1 receptor, and is consistent with their rank order of affinity at muscarinic M2 or M4 receptors. Because tremulous jaw movements are related to striatal function, and the muscarinic M4 receptor is more predominant than the muscarinic M2 receptor as a post-synaptic receptor in striatum, the present results suggest that pilocarpine induces jaw movements due to muscarinic M4 receptor stimulation. In view of the hypothesized relation between parkinsonism and cholinomimetic-induced jaw movements, these data suggest that a centrally-acting muscarinic M4 receptor antagonist could be useful as an antiparkinsonian agent.",

Repeatability was excellent for GC/MS and good for immunoassays. The specificity was not different for the three immunoassays (96%). The sensitivity varied from 36, 64 to 75% for OnLine, RIA Immunalysis and RIA DPC, respectively.

Several factors likely to affect the analyte recovery were screened in a fractional factorial design in order to examine their effect on the extraction recovery. Parameters found significant in the screening were further investigated with the use of response surface methodology. The final conditions for extraction of benzodiazepines were as follows: Octanol was immobilised on a polyacrylate fibre for 4 min. The fibre was placed in the sample and extraction took place at pH 6.0 for 15 min. Urine samples were added to 0.3 g ml(-1) sodium chloride. In plasma, the extraction recovery was less than in urine and releasing the benzodiazepines from plasma proteins followed by protein precipitation was found necessary prior to sampling. The method was validated and found linear over the range of samples. The limits of detection in urine were determined to be in the range 0.01-0.45 micromol l(-1). The corresponding limits of detection in plasma were in the range 0.01-0.48 micromol l(-1). Finally, the method developed was applied to determine some benzodiazepines after administration of a single dose. This method offers sufficient enrichment for bioanalysis after a single dose of high dose benzodiazepines as diazepam, but for low dose benzodiazepines as flunitrazepam, further sensitivity is needed.",

    "130": "A C6 glioma cell line stably transfected with the human kappa opioid receptor (kappaOR) was used to characterize receptor binding and G protein activation via the kappaOR by a comprehensive series of opioid ligands. The ligand-binding affinity for [3H]5alpha,7alpha, 8beta(-)-N-methyl-N-(7-Cl-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro(4, 5)dec-8-yl)benzene acetamide (U69593) was similar to that observed in monkey brain membranes and was 10-fold lower in the presence of sodium and GDP. Both peptide and nonpeptide agonists maximally stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding. The stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding was blocked by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin. Partial stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding via the kappaOR was observed for several ligands that are antagonists at the mu opioid receptor, suggesting an additional mechanism of drug action. The ability of isomers of tifluadom and levallorphan to stimulate [35S]GTPgammaS binding indicates that the chiral carbon of levallorphan, a benzomorphan derivative, imparts a greater degree of stereoselectivity than does the chiral carbon in the benzodiazepine derivative tifluadom. In addition, (-)tifluadom, the less potent isomer of tifluadom, which is also a gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor agonist, stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding. In contrast, d-pentazocine, (+)SKF10047, (+)cyclazocine, and d-ethylketocyclazocine displayed no agonist activity. kappaOR-selective antagonist norbinaltorphimine competitively inhibited the stimulation of [35S]GTPgammaS binding by the active isomers of ethylketocyclazocine, cyclazocine, and nalorphine to the same degree, indicating that all three ligands are eliciting an effect via the kappaOR. The results suggest that these cells express a homogeneous population of kappaOR, and that their [35S]GTPgammaS-binding properties make them an excellent means to assess kappaOR efficacy.", 
    "131": "Clozapine and olanzapine behave as weak H3-receptor antagonists in vitro with Ki values around 1 and 50 microM, respectively. Despite these modest apparent affinities, both compounds given orally to mice, nearly doubled steady-state tele-methylhistamine levels in brain, with ED50 values as low as 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively, an effect comparable to those of potent H3-receptor antagonists. This effect corresponded to an enhancement of histamine turnover rate from 45 to 73 ng/g/h as measured in the case of olanzapine using the pargyline test. Other antipsychotics displaying, such as clozapine and olanzapine, high 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2A receptor antagonist potency, i.e., risperidone, thioridazine, seroquel, and iloperidone, also enhanced markedly tele-methylhistamine levels. This effect was 1) additive with that of a pure H3-receptor antagonist, ciproxifan, 2) mimicked by a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, 3) reversed by a 5-HT2A receptor agonist, DOI, 4) not shared by antipsychotics with low affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor, i.e., haloperidol, sulpiride, raclopride, or remoxipride that, on the contrary, tended to reduce tele-methylhistamine levels. We conclude that in contrast to \"typical\" antipsychotics, \"atypical\" antipsychotics stimulate histamine neuron activity via blockade of the 5-HT2A receptor in vivo. This effect does not appear to account for their reduced extrapyramidal side-effects but may underlie their pro-cognitive properties.",

    "138": "Lifetime use was reported by 5.9% (n = 53) of subjects, with frequency of use ranging from 1 to 40 times. Flunitrazepam was taken most often with alcohol (74%), and 49% took this substance with other illicit drugs. Logistic regression analyses controlling for age and race/ethnicity found that users were significantly more likely than were nonusers to report lifetime use of marijuana (odds ratio [OR] = 3.6) or LSD (OR = 5.2), having a peer or partner who used flunitrazepam (OR = 21.7), pressure to use flunitrazepam when out with friends (OR = 2.7), and a mother who had at least a high school education (OR = 2.6). Finally, 10% of voluntary users reported experiencing subsequent physical or sexual victimization.", 
    "139": "Voluntary use of flunitrazepam is becoming a health concern to sexually active young women who reside in the southwestern United States. Young women who have used LSD or marijuana in the past or who have a peer or partner who used this drug appear to be at the greatest risk.", 
    "140": "The reversible binding of ethacrynic acid was characterized by a difference circular dichroism method. A 2/1 stoichiometry was determined for the [drug]/[HSA] (human serum albumin) complex. The reversible binding of ethacrynic acid to HSA determines direct competition with ligands that selectivity bind to site II and to the fatty acid site. Furthermore, indirect competition was shown for ligands for site I (anti-cooperative) and to site III (cooperative).", 
    "141": "This study compared the drug-utilization costs and indicators of clinical outcomes associated with the use of risperidone and olanzapine in a hospital setting. We conducted a nonrandomized, retrospective chart review of consecutive patients identified as presenting with psychotic symptoms on inpatient wards at Riverview Hospital in British Columbia and given either risperidone or olanzapine as their first new drug after reassessment (n = 30 per treatment group). Data were collected for up to 120 days. No significant differences were observed between groups in terms of sex, age, duration of illness, or diagnosis. The mean dosage of risperidone for responders was 4.89 +/- 2.56 mg/d, whereas that for olanzapine was 17.19 +/- 3.88 mg/d. The associated daily drug-acquisition costs were significantly different, at CA$4.69 for risperidone and CA$11.52 for olanzapine. Notes in patient charts indicated that a significantly greater proportion of risperidone-treated patients (60.0%) than olanzapine-treated patients (26.7%) responded to therapy, as indicated by improvement in at least one target symptom (P < 0.01). Forty percent of patients initially treated with risperidone were discharged on their original therapy, compared with 13.3% of patients treated with olanzapine (P < 0.05). These results were not substantially affected by correction for markers of illness severity or treatment resistance. Overall, no significant differences in side effects were recorded in the patient records of the two groups. Within this cohort of patients, risperidone treatment was associated with lower drug-acquisition cost and better treatment outcomes than olanzapine.", 
    "142": "Status epilepticus is an epileptic seizure that lasts at least 30 minutes or is repeated at sufficiently brief intervals to produce a continued epileptic condition lasting a total of 30 minutes without the patient fully regaining consciousness. Various combinations of anticonvulsant agents, including benzodiazepines, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, have been used to manage this condition. However, at least 9% of patients with generalized convulsive status epilepticus do not respond to conventional first-line agents, and additional intervention is required. Refractory status epilepticus refers to sustained seizures that do not respond to initial drug therapy and persist longer than 60 minutes. Reports on the response to first- and second-line agents suggest that the incidence of refractory status epilepticus is between 2000 and 6000 cases per year in the United States. Refractory status epilepticus is a major medical and neurologic emergency that requires immediate treatment to avoid significant morbidity and mortality. The anticonvulsive agent midazolam has proved to be effective, well tolerated, and fast acting when used to treat refractory status epilepticus in both adults and children. Its pharmacodynamic effects can be seen within 1 to 5 minutes of administration, and its anticonvulsive effects are apparent as early as 5 to 15 minutes after administration. This article reviews the pharmacology of midazolam and recent clinical reports on the drug's tolerability and effectiveness in the treatment of patients with refractory status epilepticus.", 
    "143": "The assessment od drugs taken by elderly people remains a difficult subject since epidemiological data on drug intake in this population is very limited. In a study undertaken in the context of the PAQUID project, drug use was screened in a group of 3,777 elderly people living at home in the Gironde and Dordogne regions of south-west France. In this group, 89.1% of subjects take at least one drug per day, with an average daily intake of 4.1 drugs by 41% of the group. One third of these elderly people take a benzodiazepine drug. Excessive intake of drugs by elderly people is a phenomenon encountered in Scandinavia and Italy but not in the United Kingdom.", 
    "144": "Using a cytoplasmic domain of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a new protein that specifically interacts with PBR. We named it PRAX-1, for peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein 1. PRAX-1 is a 1857-amino acid protein, the sequence of which was structurally unrelated to any known proteins. The gene encoding PRAX-1 is located in the q22-q23 region of the long arm of the human chromosome 17. The PRAX-1 mRNA is 7.5 kilobase pairs, predominantly expressed in the central nervous system, pituitary gland, and thymus. At the protein level, we found the PRAX-1 as a single 220-250-kDa protein in the brain and in many different human cell lines tested using specific antibody raised against PRAX-1. Parallel analysis of the PRAX-1 mRNA and protein expression performed in mouse and rat gave similar results. Immunocytochemistry analysis carried out to define the distribution of the PRAX-1 protein in the rat brain showed that PRAX-1 was prevalent in the mesolimbic system, specially abundant in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. Exhibiting several domains involved in protein-protein interaction (three proline-rich domains, three leucine-zipper motifs, and an Src homology region 3-like domain), the PRAX-1 may be looked upon as a new adaptator protein. We show that both the Src homology region 3-like domain and a proline-rich domain in PRAX-1 are required for the interaction with PBR. PRAX-1 is a cytoplasmic protein that also partially colocalizes with PBR in the mitochondria, as determined by confocal microscopy and Western blotting. Altogether our observations support a model of interaction implicating PBR and this newly described protein, PRAX-1. As being the first cytoplasmic protein associated with PBR, PRAX-1 is a new tool that opens new fields for exploring PBR biological roles.", 
    "145": "Benzodiazepines have a direct bronchodilator action in airway smooth muscle, but the mechanisms by which these agents produce muscle relaxation are not fully understood. The current study was performed to identify the effects of the benzodiazepines diazepam and midazolam on Ca2+ and K+ channels in canine tracheal smooth muscle cells.", 
    "146": "Whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques were used to evaluate the effects of the benzodiazepines diazepam (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) and midazolam (10(-8) to 10(-3) M) on inward Ca2+ and outward K+ channel currents in dispersed canine tracheal smooth muscle cells. The effects of the antagonists flumazenil (10(-5) M) and PK11195 (10(-5) M) on these channels were also studied.", 
    "147": "Each benzodiazepine tested significantly inhibited Ca2+ currents in a dose-dependent manner, with 10(-6) M diazepam and 10(-5) M midazolam each causing approximately 50% depression of peak voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents. Both benzodiazepines promoted the inactivated state of the channel at more-negative potentials. The Ca2+-activated and voltage-dependent K+ currents were inhibited by diazepam and midazolam (> 10(-5) M and > 10(-4) M, respectively). Flumazenil and PK11195 had no effect on these channel currents or on the inhibitory effects of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "148": "Diazepam and midazolam had inhibitory effects on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, which lead to muscle relaxation. However, high concentrations of these agents were necessary to inhibit the K+ channels. The lack of antagonized effects of their antagonists is related to the non-gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated electrophysiologic effects of benzodiazepines on airway smooth muscle contractility."
