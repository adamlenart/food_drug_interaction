    "0": "Several N-(indol-3-ylglyoxylyl)dipeptide derivatives 1-12 were synthesized and tested for their affinity at the benzodiazepine receptor in bovine cortical membranes. They proved to bind with low or no affinity at the receptor site. It was hypothesized that this result was not due to the steric hindrance of the dipeptide side chain, but to the establishment of intramolecular hydrogen bonds involving the indole N-H and/or the glyoxylyl C = O(2). Conformational analysis indicated that coiled conformations, with intramolecular hydrogen bonds, were energetically more favoured than the staggered, completely unfolded ones. Therefore, the low or no affinity of these compounds should be attributed to the unavailability of the N-H and/or C = O(2) groups for the binding, again confirming that both these groups are necessary for interaction with the receptor.", 
    "1": "1,3-Dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-pyrido[3,2-e]-1,4-diazepin-2-ones (11-13), in which the chlorophenyl ring of 7-chloro-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones is replaced by a pyridyl ring, were synthesized and evaluated as anticonvulsants using subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ) and maximal electroshock (MES) induced seizure screening tests. A methyl substituent at the N-1 and/or C-3 position of the diazepin-2-one ring system was not a determinant of scPTZ activity, but the 1,3-dimethyl derivative (13) was more potent than the parent 1,3-unsubstituted compound (11) in the MES screen. 1,3-Dihydro-1,3-dimethyl-5-phenyl-2H-pyrido[3,2-e]-1,4-diazepin-2- one (13) inhibited sc bicuculline and sc picrotoxin induced seizures, but it did not inhibit in vitro benzodiazepine binding which suggests it may act by a different mechanism of action. In the mouse Phase II scPTZ screen all compounds tested were less active than clonazepam but more active than valproic acid.", 
    "2": "Nalbuphine-midazolam ataractanalgesia has been studied in anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia. Attention has been applied to the efficiency, pharmacological activity, side effects, adverse reactions of nalbuphine as a fentanyl substitute. Preliminary results show that nalbuphine could be used safely as anaesthesia component and as postoperative analgetic.", 
    "3": "Severe orthostatic and cardiorespiratory dysregulation may occur during institution of clozapine therapy both during concomitant benzodiazepine medication and on reinstitution of clozapine after a washout period. Extensive medical and neurological workup before and after the trials can nevertheless be normal. The absence of similar previous reactions to other drugs, adhering to monotherapy with clozapine, increasing dosage slowly or performing a single test for orthostatic reactions after initiating clozapine are insufficient precautionary measures. Cardiorespiratory complications can occur without the challenge of assuming an erect position but appear to otherwise run an initial course similar to that of severe orthostatic reactions. A significantly abnormal response to testing for orthostatic reactions may be established, but only during the period of vulnerability to cardiorespiratory dysregulation. Repeated testing for this predisposition during the first weeks of clozapine therapy is suggested.", 
    "4": "Whole-cell and single-channel currents evoked by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were recorded from rat cerebellar granule cells in culture. The electrophysiological properties of these currents were studied in control condition and in the presence of external Zn2+ (10-30 microM). GABA (10 microM) induced bicuculline-sensitive whole-cell currents which desensitized. The desensitization was more rapid for higher concentrations of GABA (30-300 microM). The current-voltage relation of GABA currents was linear from -70 to +50 mV. Two different types of cells were found with respect to the stoichiometry for agonist binding, one with Hill coefficient 1.5 and another one with coefficient 1. The half-maximum concentration displayed more variability, with values varying from 10 to 50 microM. The time constant of recovery from desensitization (tau r) was estimated to be 36 s. Zn2+ (30 microM) blocked GABA-activated whole-cell currents in a non-competitive and voltage-independent way without a significant change in the current kinetics. In excised outside-out patches, GABA (0.5 microM) activated single-channel events of 19 and 31 pS. Kinetic analysis yielded two mean shut times (tau c1 = 2.70 ms, tau c2 = 205 ms) and one mean open time (tau o = 3.64 ms). Zn2+ (10 microM) did not affect single-channel conductances and mean open and shut times, but significantly reduced the probability of opening from 0.17 to 0.06. It is probable that Zn2+ binds to a site located on the extracellular part of the GABAA receptor channel complex.", 
    "5": "There is evidence that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is released from some efferent olivocochlear nerve endings terminating at outer hair cells (OHCs). Using monoclonal antibodies against postsynaptic GABAA receptor from bovine cerebral cortex we confirm the presence of GABA and benzodiazepine bindings sites of alpha- and beta-subunits of GABAA receptors at the basal pole of isolated OHCs. Whole-cell recording with viable OHCs revealed that the application of 10(-3)-10(-8) M GABA to the cell surface was followed by a concentration-dependent hyperpolarization of the outer cell membrane. Hyperpolarization was increased in the presence of 2.5 x 10(-5) M chlorazepate, a benzodiazepine derivative. Electrophysiological effects caused by GABA alone or in combination with chlorazepate were specifically inhibited by 10(-6) M of the GABA-receptor antagonist picrotoxin. Moreover, 10(-5)-10(-7) M GABA caused reversible slow elongation of the cylindrical hair cell body in OHCs examined. These neurotransmitter-induced motile responses were specifically blocked by 10(-4) M picrotoxin. The results suggest that a subpopulation of OHCs express alpha- and beta-subunits of GABAA receptors which both form a GABA/benzodiazepine-receptor complex at the basal pole of isolated OHCs. These receptors are thought to allow GABA which is released from efferent auditory nerve terminals to bind to the cell surface of OHCs, resulting in GABAA-receptor activation. This probably gates a GABAA-receptor-associated chloride channel in the postsynaptic OHC membrane, allowing hyperpolarization and elongation of the cell.", 
    "6": "Oral premedication with alprazolam was studied in 83 patients before eye surgery. Alprazolam appears to be an excellent anxiolytic drug, with minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects. A double blind study should be carried on to assess these properties.", 
    "7": "Previous work had suggested that neurons in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNpr) might be differentiated based on responsiveness to GABA and benzodiazepines (BZs). To evaluate this possibility, multi-barreled glass capillary assemblies were used to examine the effects of GABA and a BZ, flurazepam (FZP), on the spontaneous activity of single SNpr neurons in chloral hydrate anesthetized rats. Both FZP and GABA, as a function of increasing ejection current, decreased the rate of neuronal discharge. SNpr neurons differed according to the maximum effect of each agent. For over half of the cells, the spontaneous discharge could be inhibited at least 90% by GABA, while the maximum FZP effect in the same cells ranged from 20 to 100% inhibition. Except for 3 neurons, the maximum inhibition produced by GABA was about the same or greater than that produced by FZP. No clear anatomical segregation according to BZ effect was found.", 
    "8": "The functional integrity of the cortical muscarinic receptor (MR)-mediated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-specific phospholipase C signalling pathway was assessed in Alzheimer disease (AD) and age-matched control subjects. There was no difference in the basal hydrolysis of [3H]-PIP2 to [3H]-inositol phosphates between control and AD membrane preparations. However, muscarinic agonist-stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis was significantly diminished in the AD cases. Diminished agonist-stimulated PIP2 hydrolysis correlated with the loss in high affinity agonist binding (KL/KH ratio) to the M1 muscarinic receptor subtype in the disease. These data further support the hypothesis that muscarinic receptor-mediated signal transduction is altered in AD, and that the defect lies at the level of muscarinic receptor-G protein/effector coupling.", 
    "9": "Poisonings due to ingestion of a calcium channel or beta-adrenergic blocker have been the subject of several previous reports, but reports of poisoning due to combined ingestion of these drugs are infrequent. This is a report of suicidal ingestion of nifedipine 600 mg, metoprolol 200 mg, and etizolam 20 mg. Intravenous dopamine, norepinephrine, and calcium chloride had little effect but the administration of methylprednisolone and glucagon were associated with an increase in systolic blood pressure above 100 mm Hg.", 
    "10": "The efficacy of sublingual buprenorphine given for premedication was assessed in 287 consecutive patients scheduled for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). The patients were randomly assigned to three groups. They were given 45 min before starting ESWL 5 mg midazolam orally in group 1 (n = 97), and 5 mg midazolam orally and 0.2 mg sublingual buprenorphine in group 2 (n = 97), and 5 mg midazolam orally and 0.4 mg sublingual buprenorphine in group 3 (n = 93). Analgesia was assessed with a simple three step verbal scale: no pain, moderate pain treated with simple analgesics (Spasfon, Visc\u00e9ralgine), and exquisite pain requiring general anaesthesia. Sublingual buprenorphine provided good analgesia in 87% of group 2 patients, and 88% of group 3 patients (NS) whereas 70% of group 1 patients experienced no pain (p < 0.05). The incidence of side-effects during the 12 h following ESWL, such as nausea, vomiting and drowsiness, was higher in group 3 (31 patients) than in group 2 (13 patients) (p > 0.01). No clinical respiratory depression occurred, although 11 patients in group 3 complained of drowsiness. It is concluded that premedication with 0.2 mg of sublingual buprenorphine provides efficient analgesia for ESWL and few side-effects.", 
    "11": "Midazolam is the benzodiazepine recommended for anaesthesia induction when an early recovering is desirable. Flumazenil, which is also a hydrosoluble imidazobenzodiazepine, improves the safety of the forhere one because it immediately reduces the degree of sedation. With this purpose, this last drug has been studied in 25 patients who had been previously treated with Midazolam in order to carry out different endoscopic studies. The Flumazenil average dose used was 0.276 mg and the conscience recovering after its intravenous injection, evaluated by a simple oral numeric regression test, oscillated between 60 and 300 seconds with an X of 96 seconds. Once the study was finished, all patients were discharged from hospital after two-hour observation, except for one patient (4%) who suffered a complication and so was discharged after a twenty-four-hour control. No doubt the advent of a drug opposed to benzodiazepine receptors used in anaesthetic induction shows the possibility of a quick recovering and moreover. Quicker discharge from hospital.",

    "13": "This study was undertaken to investigate in a prospective randomized way the influence of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil on endocrine stress response and haemodynamic parameters after modified neuroleptanaesthesia. A total of 24 patients (ASA scores I or II) aged between 18 and 60 who were scheduled for major gynaecological surgery, were investigated. For modified neuroleptanaesthesia, midazolam, fentanyl and vecuronium were administered in standardized doses. After extubation, patients of the flumazenil group received initial injections of 0.2 mg flumazenil to antagonize the residual effect of midazolam and additional doses of 0.1 mg per minute until the desired level of vigilance was reached (awareness of person, time and place). In the control group no flumazenil was used. Endocrine stress parameters and haemodynamic parameters were measured at 7 different times, from before induction of anaesthesia up to 60 minutes after the operation. In both groups, a marked increase in endocrine stress response was observed. Adrenaline, noradrenaline, antidiuretic hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, glucose and lactate, however, were not additionally influenced by the antagonism. No influence of flumazenil on mean arterial pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation was observed. After modified neuroleptanaesthesia, a careful antagonism of midazolam with small doses of flumazenil is not disadvantageous with respect of endocrine stress response and haemodynamic reactions.", 
    "14": "For studying the hemodynamics of the greater and lesser circulatory system in animals, the impact of general anesthesia upon cardiovascular functions should be as small, as possible. The marked circulation-depressing effect of halothane, which has so far been given preference for experiments on large animals, was confirmed by the present study of the miniature pig. There was a significant decrease in MAP, cardiac index and dp/dtmax/IP, and an increase in PAPp. Useful insights into hemodynamics, derived from experiments modeling the heart, lungs or vascular system cannot be gained for a cardiovascular system, the functions of which are greatly altered by such an anesthesia. As a new form of anesthesia with minimal cardiovascular influence, the ketamine-diazepam N2O combination, which has already been successfully applied in operations on the open human heart, is introduced into experimental surgery.", 
    "15": "Neurobiological research over the past decade has greatly expanded our knowledge of alcohol's interaction with the nervous system and promises significant improvement in pharmacological treatment for all phases of alcoholism. Although no new treatment has yet become standard clinical practice, over the next decade benzodiazepine receptor antagonists and inverse agonists should improve treatment of acute alcohol intoxication, adrenergic agents and anticonvulsants should improve treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal, and serotonin uptake blockers and mu opiate receptor antagonists should improve long-term treatment of alcohol dependence. Future clinical research should reduce the current lack of knowledge on pharmacological treatment of alcoholism in special populations such as women, the elderly, and those with concurrent psychiatric diagnoses.", 
    "16": "A national survey of members of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry was conducted to update information on the use of sedative agents by pediatric dentists. All 2532 members of the Academy were sent questionnaires regarding their use of sedation and 1497 responded. Practitioners were questioned regarding how frequently they used sedative agents and the nature of patients receiving sedation. In addition, they were questioned on reasons for change, if any, in their use of sedation during the past two years. A separate survey was conducted of directors of all 55 postdoctoral training programs in pediatric dentistry. Forty-six directors responded to questions concerning the type and frequency of sedation use in their programs. Both surveys demonstrated wide differences in sedation use between different training programs and between different practitioners. The heavier use of sedation by some practitioners or by some training programs, as compared with others, generally was not related to the percentage of handicapped patients who received sedation, nor to the type of training. Frequent users of sedation (more than once each day) were located more in the south/southeastern and western parts of the country and they tended to have been in specialty practice for more than 10 years.", 
    "17": "A prospective investigation on the short-term effects of various sedation regimens on 549 nonhospitalized magnetic resonance (MR) patients was performed. The drugs evaluated were chloral hydrate, pentobarbital, midazolam, and diazepam (fentanyl was used for enhancement after any of these drugs). The overall safety and efficacy were quite good with all the regimens. Overall, 84% of children slept less than 8 h after the examination, 90% were drowsy and/or unsteady for less than 8 h after they awoke, and 97% resumed their usual activities by 24 h. Significant hyperactivity was seen only with pentobarbital and occurred in 8.4% of children over 8 years of age. The multiple-dose regimen of pentobarbital and fentanyl had a significant short-term effect on the children less than 8 years of age, with 35% sleeping longer than 8 h after the MR. Ten children who had needed the multiple-dose pentobarbital regimen or who had failed prior pentobarbital sedation presented for repeat sedation. Midazolam was effective in 9 of these 10 children.", 
    "18": "Evidence from preclinical studies, preliminary clinical reports, pharmacologic challenge studies and a small number of controlled trials suggests that several antiepileptic agents--valproate, carbamazepine, and clonazepam--may have therapeutic effects in the treatment of patients with panic disorder. We review the theoretical basis and available clinical data supporting the use of these agents in panic disorder.", 
    "19": "The effects of Ca2+ channel blockers on the development of physical dependence on diazepam were examined in mice. Co-administration of flunarizine (T-type Ca2+ channel sensitive blocker), but not of either nifedipine or diltiazem (L-type Ca2+ channel sensitive blockers), with diazepam significantly suppressed the hypersensitivity to FG 7142 following chronic treatment with diazepam. The hypersensitivity to FG 7142 may reflect benzodiazepine withdrawal convulsions. These results suggest that flunarizine, but not nifedipine or diltiazem, may suppress the development of physical dependence on diazepam, and that T-type Ca2+ channels in the brain, rather than L-type Ca2+ channels, may be involved in the development of physical dependence on diazepam.", 
    "20": "A post-marketing surveillance survey of dipotassium clorazepate usage was carried out in the Philippines between July 1990 and April 1991. Data were analyzed on 562 patients suffering from conditions in which anxiety was a major component. The results suggest that the medication was prescribed in accordance with the generally accepted best practice for benzodiazepines. Overall, 85% of patients were reported to have recovered and only 2% reported minor side-effects. Dipotassium clorazepate was thus confirmed to be a highly effective and relatively safe anxiolytic agent.", 
    "21": "The present study was designed to compare the allosteric modulatory effects of GABAergic drugs on 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) binding in the cerebral cortex of newborn (5-day-old) and adult (90-day-old) rats. To examine the influence of GABA on the modulation of 35S-TBPS binding, the assays were performed in unwashed membranes (in which the concentration of GABA was dependent on the content of this neurotransmitter in vivo), and in extensively washed membranes in the presence of defined concentrations of exogenous GABA (3 microM). In unwashed membranes, the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, and the inverse agonist for benzodiazepine receptors, 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid-methyl ester (DMCM) increased 35S-TBPS binding in a concentration-dependent manner in adult rats, but not in newborn rats. By contrast, in extensively washed membranes (plus 3 microM GABA) both bicuculline and DMCM were able to stimulate 35S-TBPS binding either in newborn or in adult rats. On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of diazepam on 35S-TBPS binding was observed in both unwashed and extensively washed membranes from newborn and adult rats. These results reflect the early development of the allosteric interaction between the different components of the GABAA receptor complex. In addition, the age-dependent changes in the concentration of endogenous GABA play a critical role in the modulation of 35S-TBPS binding by GABAergic drugs.", 
    "22": "In rats placed in a T maze consisting of an enclosed arm at right angles with two open arms elevated 50 cm above the ground, ip doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg diazepam (DZP) abolished the delay of withdrawal from the enclosed arm towards the open arms, measured by retesting in the presence of the drug soon after training, as well as by further retesting 72 h later, in the absence of the drug. Therefore, DZP had both anxiolytic and amnestic effects on this inhibitory avoidance task. In contrast, DZP did not affect the latency of withdrawal from one of the open arms towards the closed arm on the first day. Moreover, the latency of this escape response similarly decreased in all treatment groups in the retest performed 72 h later, indicating that memory of this task was resistant to DZP. These results support the view that the anxiolytic and amnestic effects of benzodiazepines are closely related, and suggest that this new elevated T maze model may be useful for simultaneous measurement of drug effects on anxiety and memory.", 
    "23": "The surgical removal of third molars is a frequently carried out procedure under day-stay general anesthesia. Economic considerations and the demand on hospital facilities together with the reduced incidence of morbidity suggest that intravenous sedation is an excellent alternative modality. Thirty cases of third molar surgery with intravenous sedation are described wherein excellent operating conditions and reduced morbidity are reported.", 
    "24": "Tolerance to the sedative effects of the benzodiazepine group of drugs is well documented. A brief review of the literature is presented. Three cases in which tolerance to intravenous midazolam became apparent and caused a significant problem during the attempted induction of conscious sedation are described. The patients were all concurrently receiving treatment with other benzodiazepines. It is recommended that patients with a history of regular, current benzodiazepine use be treated with caution with regard to this type of sedation.", 
    "25": "The purpose of this study was to determine the sedative effect of a 0.2 mg/kg dose of midazolam, administered intranasally, prior to performing various restorative dental procedures on a group of mentally disabled patients under local anesthesia and nitrous oxide/oxygen analgesia. Twenty-one patients, aged 4 to 21 years, all of whom had previously exhibited highly combative and resistant behavior toward dental treatment under local anesthesia, were sedated with 0.2 mg/kg midazolam. Only patients assessed as ASA anesthesia status I or II were admitted to the study. After administering the midazolam, each patient was allowed to rest before initiating the dental procedures. Behavioral patterns during the various procedures were rated on a behavioral rating scale of 1-7. Each patient served as his or her own control, comparing behavior with or without intranasal midazolam. The results showed a marked improvement in behavioral patterns after administration of intranasal midazolam. Ratings on a scale of 1-7 were noted as \"markedly effective\" and \"effective\" for 69.2% of those patients who received infiltration injection anesthesia, 93.8% under rubber dam, 76.2% during cavity preparation, 84.2% for restoration placement and 87.5% during pulpotomy procedures. The majority of patients were discharged within 150 minutes of intranasal instillation. Further studies are indicated to ascertain the most appropriate dose of intranasally administered midazolam.", 
    "26": "Rats chronically received alpha-bungarotoxin which caused a reduction of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and weakness, especially of lip muscles. It was found that diazepam (0.75-2 mg kg-1, s.c.), after a 15 min period of excitation and increased lip weakness, caused sedation and some improvement of the lip. Even after 5 mg kg-1 diazepam, muscle function was not markedly affected and breathing appeared normal. It is concluded that sedation in rats by diazepam does not entail aggravation of the muscle weakness caused by a partial neuromuscular block.", 
    "27": "Benzodiazepine receptor sites were determined by saturable [3H]flunitrazepam binding in hippocampal tissue from schizophrenic and control subjects. No difference in receptor density or affinity between the two groups was observed, indicating that the previously identified GABAergic deficit in the hippocampus in schizophrenia does not apparently lead to up-regulation of these receptor sites. The implications of this finding are discussed.", 
    "28": "In 60 insomnia patients placebo-controlled clinical examinations were performed with Dormicum hypnotic containing 15 mg midazolam active substance and made available by EGIS Pharmaceuticals. The patients involved in the study lived a normal life and belonged to both sexes. In the introduction the author summarizes the different forms of pathological sleep and discusses the pharmacology of some hypnotics on the basis of which a detailed, multifactorial, up-to-date clinical examination of a hypnotic should be planned. He uses up-to-date methods and means for the examination of the drug which meet the requirements of an adequate clinical testing of a hypnotic. The sleep disturbances of the patients have been classified and characterized by the author from the somnological aspects and with somnological methods. Patients with sleep onset, sleep maintenance, early morning, as well as mixed insomnias were differentiated. The effectivity of the drug was evaluated on the basis of data of sleep questionnaires referring to the target symptoms and the results of 24-hour polygraphic monitorings performed in 18 patients. In addition, the eventual hangover effect of the drug was assessed in these patients on the basis of the changes in reaction time, pulse rate, and skin resistance measured by polygraphy, besides placebo control on the day following the intake of the drug. The neurological and other organic side-effects were also examined and registered by means of the self-evaluating questionnaires, target specific interviewing of the patients, as well as by laboratory examinations. The drug proved to be most valuable as a hypnotic in patients with sleep onset and mixed insomnias. The hypnotic action was not so definite in sleep maintenance insomnias, the poorest responses were obtained in early morning insomnia cases. According to the results of polygraphic sleep examinations the two first sleep cycles become normal following the intake of the hypnotic. Parameters characteristic of REM sleep do not show changes. In the examined patients the number of side- and hangover effects attributable to the drug was very low. The author calls the attention to the importance of the observance of the dosage and administration of the drug which may prevent the development of a great number of side-effects. By giving a detailed description of a case history of an insomniac patient the author illustrates how the application field of midazolam may be further extended--within the frames of a sleep therapeutic process.", 
    "29": "Adrenal-derived cells in culture slowly upregulate numbers of putative calcium channel proteins in response to inhibitory drugs including ethanol, benzodiazepines and morphine. This appears to be an adaptive response to cell inhibition involving second messengers and protein phosphorylation and culminating in alterations in expression of the calcium channel gene (Fig. 1). These increases in calcium channels lead to rebound increases in cell excitability when the depressant drugs are withdrawn (a characteristic feature of chemical dependence on depressant drugs) so that this change in numbers of calcium channels may provide a model for one mechanism of chemical dependence. Similar findings have been reported in the brains of animals made dependent on depressant drugs, and genetic and pharmacological manipulations of dependence and withdrawal further support a role for calcium channels in these phenomena.", 
    "30": "The effect of midazolam sedation on late evoked potentials (EPs) elicited from painful stimulation of the median nerve was investigated in 20 human volunteers. EPs were recorded from the contralateral scalp at baseline and at 5, 30, and 60 min post-midazolam infusion. Relative amplitudes of the late EPs were significantly reduced after intravenous midazolam infusion and did not return to normal during the 60 min of the experiment. Given the correlation between EP amplitude and subjective reports of experimental pain, the data support the suggestion that midazolam may have some analgesic effect.", 
    "31": "The purpose of this investigation was to compare the efficacy of diazepam and a water soluble pro-diazepam drug, avizafone (lysyl, peptido-aminobenzophenone diazepam pro-drug) in preventing or reducing the severity of soman-induced neuropathology in rats and to determine the temporal relationship between seizure initiation, anticonvulsant administration and the incidence and severity of soman-induced neuropathology. Brains from rats, treated with a convulsant dose of soman (pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate) and anticonvulsants such as diazepam and avizafone, were evaluated by light microscopy for evidence of neuropathology. All rats received atropine methyl nitrate (20 mg/kg, ip)+the bispyridinium acetylcholinesterase reactivator HI-6 (125 mg/kg, ip; 1-(((4-(aminocarbonyl)pyridinio) methoxy)methyl)-2-((hydroxyimino)methyl)-pyridinium dichloride) in the same solution 10 min before soman (130 micrograms/kg,sc). Three days later the rats were perfused and the tissue fixed for histological evaluation. Necrosis and/or malacia (degenerative changes) and hemorrhage were observed in some groups. The sites where pathology was most frequently observed and with greater severity were the piriform cortex, amygdala and (dorsal) thalamus. Less severe changes were observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. There were no changes in the hypothalamus. Diazepam given 10 minutes before soman prevented the occurrence of soman-induced convulsions and neuropathology (i.e. degenerative changes were not then seen). Diazepam given at the start of the soman-induced convulsions reduced considerably the convulsions and the degree of neuropathology. Avizafone given 10 minutes before soman reduced slightly the effect of soman. Other treatments (diazepam given 30, 60 and 120 minutes after the start of the convulsions and avizafone given at the start of convulsions) showed little or no effect on the neuropathology associated with soman administration. The results of this study have demonstrated that the use of an anticonvulsant, such as diazepam, must be initiated shortly after soman exposure in order for any therapeutic benefit to be realized.", 
    "32": "In an open design, randomised, two-way cross-over study, a single 2 mg i.v. dose and a single 30 mg oral dose of flumazenil were each administered to a group of healthy young (n = 6) and elderly (n = 12) volunteers (male: female 2/1). Plasma samples were collected at intervals and intact drug was assayed. Both the i.v. and oral doses of flumazenil were very well tolerated by both age groups and no severe or unexpected adverse effects were observed. The main complaints were dizziness and headache, mainly after oral dosing, probably due to the higher Cmax and AUC following this route of administration. After 2 mg i.v. the disposition parameters in the two age groups (elderly/young) were very similar: volume of distribution (Vss): 0.88/0.90 l.kg-1; total body clearance (ClPL): 0.86/0.99 l.min-1; terminal elimination half-life (t1/2 beta): 1.02/0.91 h. After the 30 mg oral dose the mean Cmax of 87.6 ng.ml-1 (elderly) and 78.4 ng.ml-1 (young) were generally reached within 0.5 to 1 h. In 26% (elderly) and 23% (young), the absolute bioavailability of flumazenil was very similar. It is concluded that the absorption and disposition parameters of flumazenil were not significantly affected by aging.", 
    "33": "Twelve normal male subjects received single oral doses of atenolol 100 mg (AT), bendrofluazide 5 mg (BFZ), combined atenolol 100 mg and bendrofluazide 5 mg (AT/BFZ), diazepam 5 mg (Dz), or one of two matching placebos, on each of 6 study days. Tests of psychomotor performance [digit symbol substitution (DSST), letter cancellation (LCT), continuous attention, choice reaction time (CRT), finger tapping, short-term memory, body sway], physiological measurements [critical flicker fusion (CFF), two-flash fusion (2FF)] and subjective assessments using visual analogue scales (VAS), were performed at 2 and 4 hours post-ingestion. Dz (active control) significantly worsened VAS scores at 2 h (+0.68) and reduced DSST scores at both 2 h (-15.0) and 4 h (-11.0). AT and BFZ given alone, each produced significant worsening of VAS at 2 h [AT +1.0; BFZ +1.38], but had no significant effects on performance. In combination however, AT/BFZ at 4 h produced significant impairment of DSST scores (-10.4), reduced finger tapping (-16.5) and increased involuntary rest pauses (+16.5). Despite these effects, no change in VAS scores occurred. In summary, we have demonstrated significant impairment of psychomotor performance in normal subjects with the AT/BFZ combination, which was not evident with the single agents and which occurred in the absence of a change in subjective awareness. These central effects may have important clinical implications for patients taking combined antihypertensive medication.", 
    "34": "The cholinergic system in the central nervous system is an important component of the neural circuitry of learning, memory and cognition. A decline of cholinergic innervation in the human brain is a characteristic feature of dementia of Alzheimer's type. In this study, changes in cholinergic markers were studied after a unilateral lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbM). Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry showed a loss of cortical AChE-containing neurons, and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry demonstrated a loss of cholinergic cells in nbM. The localizations of muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors using [3H]pirenzepine ([3H]PZ) and [3H]AF-DX 384, respectively, were studied by quantitative autoradiography 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks following unilateral ibotenic acid lesion of nbM. A significant decrease in [3H]PZ binding sites was observed at postlesion week 1 in the parietal and temporal cortices. The decrease in [3H]AF-DX 384 binding sites on the lesioned side was observed throughout frontal, parietal and temporal cortices after postlesion week 1, with a significant increase after 6 weeks, possibly as result of loss of presynaptic receptors and upregulation of postsynaptic ones. Moreover, laminar distribution after nbM lesion shows that M1 and M2 receptor binding sites are more affected in superficial layers (I,II,III) than in the deep layers (IV,V,VI), depending on ligand, postlesion period and cortical region. Furthermore, nbM lesion causes a higher deficit of M2 receptors than of M1 receptors. These data suggest the existence of a presynaptic population as well as a postsynaptic population of M1 and M2 receptors which are differently affected after unilateral nbM lesion.", 
    "35": "Considerable evidence indicates that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is responsible for integrating not only the endocrine, but the autonomic and behavioral responses of an organism to stress. We have investigated the effects of the anxiolytic triazolobenzodiazepine, alprazolam, on the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and of CRF neurons following acute and chronic administration. In addition, because many of the signs and symptoms observed in animals and humans following abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines resemble those of the stress response, we examined the effect of alprazolam withdrawal on CRF neurons and HPA axis activity. Alprazolam decreases CRF concentrations in the locus coeruleus 0.5-3.0 hours following acute injection. Similarly, chronic (14 days) alprazolam administration also results in decreased CRF concentrations in the locus coeruleus. CRF concentrations return to control values 24 hours following abrupt alprazolam withdrawal. Moreover, abrupt alprazolam withdrawal results in increased plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations and decreased anterior pituitary CRF receptor concentrations 24 hours following drug discontinuation. Thus, abrupt alprazolam withdrawal profoundly activates the HPA axis. These indices of HPA axis activity return to control values by 48 hours post-withdrawal. These actions of alprazolam on CRF neurons are opposite to those observed following acute or chronic stress. These results support the hypothesis that CRF-containing neurons innervating the locus coeruleus may be involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety, and in the actions of clinically efficacious anxiolytics.", 
    "36": "Several kinds of evidence indicate that there are important psychological causes of panic disorder as well as the biological causes that have been demonstrated by others. These psychological causes are fears that physical symptoms of anxiety will be followed by an immediate medical emergency: for example, that palpitations will be followed by a heart attack. Evidence is presented to show (a) that such fears are more frequent among panic disorder patients than other anxious patients; (b) that activating the fears can produce panic; and (c) that reducing the fears can attenuate the effects of procedures that produce panic. For panic disorder, cognitive therapy, which reduces these specific fears, gives results comparable to those of imipramine and alprazolam. If further research confirms that these therapeutic effects of cognitive therapy are sustained well beyond the end of treatment, cognitive therapy could be the treatment of choice for panic disorder.", 
    "37": "Panic disorder is a chronic illness with only some degree of spontaneous recovery. It is not surprising therefore that discontinuation of an effective medical treatment may be followed by relapse. Therefore the timing and methodology of discontinuing that treatment are now recognized as essential facets of optimal clinical management. In addition to relapse, rebound and the withdrawal syndrome have been reported with many psychotropic agents, particularly with the benzodiazepines. This paper discusses data from three discontinuation studies with alprazolam i.e. the Phase I Cross-National Collaborative Panic discontinuation study after short-term treatment, the Phase I discontinuation study after long-term treatment, and data from the Montreal site of the Alprazolam SR discontinuation study. Phase I of the Cross-National Collaborative Study of Panic Disorder investigated the discontinuation of alprazolam in two populations. There was an intensive, placebo-controlled, time-limited study of discontinuation after short-term treatment (8 weeks) in the first population. For the second, there was a less rigorous open follow-up of patients who had been treated for 5-12 months with alprazolam. The dose-reduction regimen of alprazolam in both studies was approximately the same--a 1 mg decrease every 3-7 days. In the short-term treatment study, 109 patients were treated for 8 weeks, tapered for 4 weeks and observed for another 2 weeks post discontinuation. Significant relapse in the alprazolam-treated group occurred during discontinuation. Rebound of panic attacks occurred in 27% of patients given alprazolam, and distinct transient withdrawal syndrome occurred in 35%. Indicative of the withdrawal syndrome were confusion, clouded sensorium, heightened sensory perception, dysosmia, paresthesias, muscle cramps, muscle twitch, blurred vision, diarrhea, decreased appetite, and weight loss. The clinical course in the alprazolam-treated patients revealed a marked exacerbation of symptoms during the end of the tapering period and the first week without medication, which was followed by improvement during the second post-taper week. In the long-term treatment study, 142 patients were treated with alprazolam for periods ranging from 5 months to 1 year (mean, 27.5 weeks). In this naturalistic study, 76% of the patients reported improvement, 6.3% reported no change, and 10.6% reported that they were worse. During discontinuation, 12.8% of the 128 patients whose dosage was tapered reported some kind of nonspecified withdrawal symptoms. Of the 142 patients, 47.2% were able to taper their medication dosage and to discontinue treatment; 19.7% tapered but restarted alprazolam shortly after discontinuation; 33.1% were unable or unwilling to taper or discontinue alprazolam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The efficacy of tricyclics and benzodiazepines in the short term (approximately 2-4 months) treatment of panic disorder is well demonstrated, but efficacy over the longer term is not considered established. The present study provided systematic data from a double blind comparison of maintenance therapy (up to 8 months) of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia with alprazolam, imipramine, or placebo in 181 patients who had responded to the same regimen in a randomized 8-week treatment trial. All three groups had improved during the first 2 months (active treatments more than placebo and about equal to each other), and all maintained or extended their improvement over the next 6 months without any significant change in dose. More than twice as many alprazolam and imipramine than placebo patients (15%) remained in treatment for the full 8 months and did slightly better on symptom measures than the remaining placebo patients. Both medications were well tolerated during the maintenance period. The data suggest sustained efficacy and safety of imipramine and alprazolam over an extended period. More specifically, they suggest that tolerance does not develop to the therapeutic effects of either drug.",

Infantile autism in an early and pervasive developmental disorder described by Kanner in 1943. Anatomical, pathological and magnetic resonance imaging studies have indicated changes in the cerebellum and hippocampus of autistic subjects. Given the numerical importance and diffuse benzodiazepine receptors, their study by functional brain imaging methods in vivo could be value in cases of infantile autism as a gauge of neuronal potentiality. The main data concerning benzodiazepine complex are presented. The relations between these data and the neurophysiological hypotheses of autism are discussed.", 
    "40": "Neuroendocrine and platelet markers of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor functioning are useful tools for studying the downregulation of 5-HT receptors, a leading hypothesis for the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. The 5-HT releaser fenfluramine raises body temperature as well as plasma concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1 antagonist pindolol did not block the hyperthermic response to fenfluramine, mediating its actions via non-5-HT1 receptor subtypes (presumably 5-HT2/1C). We observed blunted hyperthermic responses to fenfluramine in unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder. We also observed that the neuroendocrine responses to fenfluramine were decreased by chronic treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline but not by chronic treatment with tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline but not by chronic treatment with adinazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine with purported antidepressant activity. IC50 values for ketanserin inhibition of 5-HT-induced platelet shape change response, a marker of 5-HT2/1c receptors, were elevated after nortriptyline treatment in depressed patients, and this increase could be accounted for by those subjects who responded well to antidepressant treatment. Adinazolam treatment did not alter the platelet shape change response. Our data suggest that downregulation of 5-HT2/1c receptors may be linked to the clinical response of depressed patients treated with nortriptyline.", 
    "41": "Two doses of alprazolam (0.1 and 0.5 mg.kg-1) were tested against a model of human absences--rhythmic EEG activity elicited by low doses of pentylenetetrazol (35 mg.kg-1)--in 10 unrestrained rats with implanted cortical electrodes. Alprazolam delayed the onset of epileptic EEG activity, decreased the number of rhythmic episodes and shortened the total duration of rhythmic activity in a dose-dependent manner. The average duration of episodes of rhythmic activity remained unchanged; other benzodiazepines studied previously were able to influence this measure.", 
    "42": "The timing of developmental administration of psychotropic drugs affecting dopaminergic and GABAergic neurotransmission is crucial for the induction of specific neurobehavioral and neurochemical changes in rodents. Compensatory mechanisms occurring in response to a prolonged treatment with some neuroleptic and anxiolytic agents during development seem to be markedly different from those occurring in response to a prolonged administration in adult animals.", 
    "43": "Drug addicts who had died in Copenhagen City and County in 1981 and 1989 were analysed for methadone. In 1981, 94 cases were analysed of which 16% were found positive for methadone, and in 1989, 70 cases were analysed of which 37% were positive. Methadone alone was found to be the cause of death in 50% more cases in 1989 than in 1981. Only half of the drug addicts who were found positive for methadone had been under methadone treatment. Morphine and benzodiazepines were the most frequently occurring other substances in both 1981 and 1989. Alcohol was found in only about 30% of the methadone-positive cases. The median whole blood concentrations of methadone found in addicts where methadone was the cause of death was 0.3 mg/kg where no alcohol was present and 0.2 mg/kg where alcohol was present. In living persons using methadone, the median was 0.1 mg methadone/kg whole blood with or without alcohol present.", 
    "44": "1. Levels of BZ receptor ligands are elevated in the brain of animal models of FHF and humans with FHF. Some of these ligands have agonist properties and some are known 1, 4-BZs which bind to the DS receptor. Much of the BZ receptor ligand activity in HE is unidentified and it is possible that some may bind to receptor subtypes other than the DS receptor. 2. Average levels of BZ receptor ligands in the brain in HE do not appear to be sufficient to augment GABAergic tone to a degree that would result in severe encephalopathy (i.e. coma). However, these ligands have a heterogeneous distribution in the brain and their neuroinhibitory effects may be potentiated by increased availability of GABA at GABAA receptors. Furthermore, that these ligands may contribute to HE is suggested by anecdotal reports of ameliorations of HE being induced in a majority of patients by the BZ receptor antagonist flumazenil. 3. The response of HE to flumazenil in humans is usually incomplete and in animal models may be modest. Potential explanations for these findings include pharmacokinetics, BZ receptor subtype specificity and higher levels of BZ receptor ligands in the brain in humans with HE than in animal models. 4. Certain BZ receptor ligands e.g. Ro 15-3505 and Ro 15-4513, that are structurally related to flumazenil, are more efficacious at ameliorating HE than flumazenil in animal models. These findings may be more dependent on differences in BZ receptor subtype specificity than differences in intrinsic activity. The properties of an ideal BZ receptor ligand for administration to a patient with HE would appear to be: (i) antagonist action at BZ receptors, (ii) no intrinsic activity apparent after a conventional pharmacologic dose, (iii) high specificity and affinity for BZ receptors, (iv) slow metabolism, and (v) absence of toxic effects. Promising ligands, such as Ro 15-3505, with weak partial inverse agonist actions and hence analeptic potential, require careful evaluation of their therapeutic index before clinical application. 5. BZ receptor ligands may be useful in the management of HE. Specifically, they may be given IV: (i) to reverse effects of exogenous BZs; (ii) to aid in the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy; (iii) to provide prognostic information; and (iv) to optimize brain function. They may also be given orally with the objective of reducing dietary protein intolerance in patients with chronic liver disease.", 
    "45": "The addition of benzodiazepines to the triplicate prescription program in New York State was successful in reducing the use of benzodiazepines in a nursing home population, but the use of alternative agents was substantially increased. The reduction in benzodiazepine use could not be shown to be associated with any reduction in risk of adverse events during a retrospective review. In order to evaluate the impact of a triplicate prescription program on patient care, endpoints of efficacy as well as toxicity must be identified prior to the implementation of new legislation. It should be incumbent upon those States considering implementation of triplicate legislation to realize that the imposition of these regulations is tantamount to forced enrollment in a clinical trial for the patients affected by the legislation. A mechanism must be available to prospectively assess changes in prescribing patterns and their clinical consequences in order to determine objectively whether the legislative intervention was a success.", 
    "46": "This clinical data is presented to emphasize the clinical seriousness of benzodiazepine dependence, its relationship to other addictive diseases, the complicated and protracted nature of its withdrawal syndrome, the various clinical reasons for prescribing benzodiazepines, and the need for physicians in all medical specialties to be alert to the possibility of chemical dependence in their patient population. Those of us prescribing benzodiazepines should have a clinical knowledge of addictive diseases and not complicate the disease process by prescribing benzodiazepines when they are clearly contraindicated.",

During this period, total annual consumption of benzodiazepines as anxiolytics remained stable, whereas their prescription as hypnotics fell (-70%). Moreover, short half-life benzodiazepines as hypnotics were preferred to long half-life ones. In parallel, there was an enhancement in new (zopiclone, zolpidem, buspirone) and old (alimemazine, hydroxyzine) drugs' consumption, the ratio benefits/risks of which have not yet been well defined.",

Over the previous year, drug abusers had a greater number of visits to their usual source of care, to emergency rooms, and to other sites than drug nonusers. Drug abusers were significantly more likely to have been hospitalized during the past year. Using a logistic model including sociodemographic factors, drug abusers were 2.3 times as likely to use an emergency room and 6.7 times as likely to be hospitalized as drug nonusers. We conclude that drug abusers are heavy users of health services compared to a group of drug nonusers.",

The annual number of deaths among drug addicts in age groups over 30 years increased, but there was no increase in the number of deaths among younger drug addicts in either country. More than 80% of the drug addicts in both samples were men. Heroin-/morphine-related deaths comprised three-quarters of the Norwegian material compared with one-third of the Danish material. The registered medical drugs propoxyphene, methadone and ketobemidone accounted for half of the Danish cases but only a small number of the Norwegian cases. Amphetamine caused few deaths in either country. Alcohol and benzodiazepines were present in more than one-third of the cases in both countries, indicating frequent use of these substances.",

Some of these markers (medium chain fatty acids, warfarin, digoxin, and bilirubin) were used as mobile phase modifiers. Using a high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) column containing HSA as stationary phase, their influence was investigated on the separation in this phase of the enantiomers of three benzodiazepines (temazepam, oxazepam, and lorazepam). Displacement effects were observed with medium chain fatty acids. This influence was proportional to the chain length and to the concentration of acid. Allosteric cooperative effects were noted with digoxin for the three benzodiazepines. Both displacement and cooperative effects were observed with warfarin. Stereoselectivity was decreased for temazepam and oxazepam and increased for lorazepam.",

    "52": "The experiments on rats with tests of avoiding \"lighting square\" and \"threatening situation\" and with the chemical stimulation of dorsal and ventral hippocampus with dopamine, 5-HT, GABA and glutamine acid, showed different functional significance of these monoamines and acidergic transmitters agents in the states of anxiety of heteromodal aversive genesis. It seems that the variations in the action spectrum of anxiolytics under study are due to unequal degree of 5-HT and GABA-ergic transmitter mechanisms of dorsal and ventral hippocampus.", 
    "53": "In the last 15 years, measurement of the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) after ligation of the coronary artery in anaesthetised dogs has become our standard method for the evaluation of the stabilizing effect of antifibrillation drugs. Analysis of a group of 143 dogs revealed that in 75 animals the VFT 8 minutes after the ligation of the coronary artery dropped to less than 1 mA (high risk group), while in the remaining 68 dogs the decrease was smaller and not below 1 mA (low risk animals). The difference between the groups could be seen already before the ligation of the coronary artery. The high risk animals had a lower VFT and a higher heart rate. The groups also differed in the response to drugs administered 15 minutes after the ligation of the coronary artery. Metipranolol, a liposoluble beta blocker of the beta 1 and 2 cardiac receptors (Trimepranol Spofa 0.3 mg.kg-1 b.w.), increased greatly the VFT in both groups already 8 minutes after the injection of the drug and eliminated the difference between the groups. Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol Hoffmann-La Roche 0.25 mg.kg-1 b.w.) increased the VFT less than metipranolol and the difference between the groups disappeared only 30 minutes after its injection. Celiprolol (Selectol Linz Chemie 3.0 mg.kg-1 b.w.) blocking beta 1 and stimulating beta 2 receptors as well as trimecaine (sodium channel blocker, Mesocain Spofa 3.0 mg.kg-1 b.w.) led only to a small insignificant increase in the VFT and the difference between the groups of dogs remained.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "1. Sulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8S, 0.03-1.00 microM), pentapeptide (CCK5) and tetrapeptide (CCK4) elicited concentration dependent depolarizations of neonate rat ventral roots in vitro. 2. CCK5 was equipotent with CCK8S although CCK4 was weaker (equipotent molar ratio 17.5). 3. CCK8S-induced depolarizations were depressed by tetrodotoxin (0.1 microM), Mg2+ ions (0.75 mM) and the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5, 10 microM). These results suggest that CCK8S-induced depolarizations were predominantly mediated through the release of an excitatory amino acid from interneuronal sites. 4. The selective CCKA and CCKB receptor antagonists, L-364,718 and L-365,260 both depressed CCK8S-induced depolarizations. CCK8S dose ratios in the presence of 1 microM L-364,718 or L-365,260 were 4.5 and 11.2 respectively, suggesting the response was mediated predominantly through stimulation of CCKB receptors. 5.

    "55": "To evaluate the relationship between the hemodynamic and ECG variables used in routine surveillance of coronary surgery and myocardial lactate metabolism, 23 middle-aged, male, beta 1-blocked patients about to undergo coronary surgery were monitored before and after endotracheal intubation with high dose (30 micrograms/kg) fentanyl-midazolam anesthesia. The induction of anesthesia was followed by a mean arterial pressure decrease (from 98 +/- 4 to 76 +/- 3 mm Hg) and heart rate increase (from 53 +/- 3 to 66 +/- 2 beats/min). After intubation the hemodynamic variables were stable except for a further, transient increase in heart rate (to 69 +/- 2 beats/min). The myocardial uptake of lactate decreased after intubation, from 48 +/- 5 mumol/min to a lowest level of 24 +/- 3 mumol/min. A lactate release was exhibited in 7/23 patients (30%). No ST-segment changes were observed. The correlation between the myocardial lactate uptake/release and hemodynamic or ECG variables was unimpressive or non-existent (r < or = 0.20). Thus, a reduced uptake and even a release of lactate occurred irrespective of the ST-segment, heart rate, or systemic or pulmonary artery pressures. In conclusion, endotracheal intubation in patients with coronary disease was consistently (17/23 patients) followed by a reduced myocardial uptake of lactate, in spite of high dose neurolept anesthesia and beta 1-blockade. This metabolic event was not consistently related to hemodynamic changes.", 
    "56": "Chronic normal-dose benzodiazepine users requesting drug withdrawal were allocated to substitution with either the new anxiolytic alpidem (n = 13) or placebo (n = 12). During the first 2 weeks of the tapering programme, the dose of benzodiazepine was kept constant; for the next 2 weeks it was halved and half-dose alpidem (25 mg twice daily) or placebo substituted; for weeks 5 and 6, the benzodiazepine was discontinued and full-dose alpidem or placebo given; next alpidem or placebo were tapered to half-dose and then finally discontinued. Regular anxiety and tranquillizer withdrawal ratings were made. Nine of 12 patients given placebo withdrew successfully compared with four of 13 alpidem-treated patients. Anxiety and other symptom levels increased in the alpidem but not the placebo patients. It was concluded that alpidem is not helpful in helping patients withdrawing from a benzodiazepine withdrawal perhaps because of partial agonist properties. These actions may imply a lesser propensity to induce dependence on long-term use.", 
    "57": "Sales statistics indicate large variations in benzodiazepine consumption between the Scandinavian countries: the current difference between Denmark (highest) and Sweden (lowest) is almost two-fold. There are also large within-country variations: e.g. benzodiazepine sales in the Swedish city of Helsingborg, which is close to Denmark, were at the average Danish level and were the highest in Sweden. Repeated prescription analyses were carried out in Helsingborg, and register data were used to compare the extent of psychiatric morbidity and psychosocial problems in this city with those in neighbouring cities. Benzodiazepine consumption was higher than the national average in all age groups. However, neither the choice of the predominant benzodiazepine agents nor the dose size or number of doses per prescription showed any major deviation. Hence, Helsingborg may have a larger proportion of benzodiazepine users or longer exposure periods among users. The latter is supported by the fact that about 40% of all benzodiazepine prescriptions were repeated. Psychiatric morbidity, suicide rate, alcohol-related diseases, unemployment and the proportion of socially isolated subjects were higher than the county average. On the other hand, within the county, there were cities that despite lower benzodiazepine sales had an equal or higher rate of suicide, unemployment and alcohol-related diseases. Of all benzodiazepine prescriptions processed in Helsingborg, > 30% were issued by < 5% of the prescribers (> or = 15 prescriptions per prescriber and per week). Thus, the higher usage of benzodiazepines in Helsingborg may partly be related to higher psychiatric morbidity and more psychosocial problems, but deviant prescribing habits among a minority of physicians are also important.", 
    "58": "The effects of the benzodiazepine derivative GYKI 52466 on ischemia-evoked neurotransmitter amino acid release were evaluated in a rat four vessel occlusion model with cerebral cortical cups. Following intravenous GYKI 52466 administration (10 mg kg-1 bolus followed by 10 mg kg-1 60 min-1 infusion) glutamate, aspartate and GABA release into cerebral cortical superfusates was enhanced by ischemia to a comparable extent to that observed in control ischemic rats. These results suggest that the protective action of GYKI 52466 against cerebral cortical ischemic injury is unlikely to be due to a selective reduction in extracellular glutamate levels, but is rather, a result of the recognized ability of this compound to block non-NMDA receptors.", 
    "59": "Rats of the selectively bred alcohol-preferring P and alcohol-nonpreferring NP lines were evaluated using three different behavioral measures of anxiety. Compared with NP rats, P rats (1) showed greater footshock-induced suppression of operant responding in an approach-avoidance conflict test; (2) spent less time in the open arms of an elevated plus maze; and (3) took longer in a passive avoidance test to step down from a platform to a grid floor where footshock was received 24 hours earlier. These findings indicate a greater degree of anxiety in the P than in the NP line of rats in these situations. Pretreatment with intraperitoneal (IP) ethanol (0.5-1.0 g/kg) injections produced anticonflict or anxiolytic effects in P but not in NP rats. However, the anticonflict effects of ethanol were small relative to those produced by chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 7.5 mg/kg) in both lines. The results demonstrate that selective breeding for divergent oral ethanol preference has produced associated differences between the P and NP lines of rats in behavioral tests of anxiety and in the anxiolytic effects of ethanol.",

The concentration remained almost unaltered after 4 weeks of zuclopenthixol treatment in the schizophrenia group and following various neuroleptic, antidepressant, and anxiolytic medications in the nonschizophrenic patients despite a significant decrease of overt psychopathology assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale.",

In a conditioned conflict situation, both idazoxan and the alpha-2-adrenoceptor yohimbine show anxiogenic-like effects; the effect of idazoxan could not be blocked by clonidine or Ro 15-1788. These data suggest that systems other than alpha-2 adrenoceptors or benzodiazepine receptors must be found to explain these anxiogenic-like properties.", 
    "62": "Concomitant depressive symptoms occur in at least 50% of patients with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The authors review the treatment implications of the presence of concomitant depressive symptoms. First considered is the extent to which traditional benzodiazepines, because of their suggested depressogenic liability, are indicated or contraindicated for such patients and the possible differential therapeutic advantage of triazolobenzodiazepines, which have shown preliminary antidepressant effect. Second, the role of tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of GAD is reviewed. A large body of literature, mostly from the 1970s, has found benefit for the tricyclics in mixed anxiety-depression. Two studies published in the 1980s found that patients suffering from a primary anxiety diagnosis but with subsyndromic levels of depression benefited from treatment with tricyclic antidepressants. The authors also review the role of the azapirones, most notably buspirone, in the treatment of GAD complicated by depressive symptoms. Evidence for its efficacy in this population comes from both retrospective analysis of previous GAD treatment studies, as well as a recent prospective study of depression with concomitant GAD.",

In vitro, AD-5423 bound preferentially to dopamine (DA)-D2 (Ki, 14.8 nM; cf. haloperidol, 8.79 nM; and clozapine, 149 nM) and serotonin (5-HT)-S2 (Ki, 3.98 nM; cf. haloperidol, 26.8 nM; and clozapine, 8.66 nM) receptors. It displayed low affinity for adrenaline (Ad)-alpha-1 (Ki, 56.3 nM) receptors and was virtually devoid of binding to DA-D1 (Ki, 2870 nM), 5-HT-S3, Ad-alpha-2, Ad-beta, muscarine, tau-aminobutyric acid and benzodiazepine receptors. In addition, AD-5423 was only a weak inhibitor of DA, 5-HT and noradrenaline uptake systems. When administered p.o., AD-5423 (0.3-10 mg/kg) increased brain contents of the DA metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in mice and rats and the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in mice. Behaviorally, AD-5423 (0.2-2 mg/kg p.o.) decreased exploratory activity in mice, suppressed conditioned avoidance responding and methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity in mice and rats, antagonized apomorphine-induced gnawing in rats and vomiting in dogs and reduced hostile responses in monkeys. In these effects, AD-5423 was more or less equi-potent to haloperidol. However, AD-5423 (10 mg/kg p.o.), unlike haloperidol, did not antagonize SKF38393-induced vacuous oral movements in rats. Head twitches induced by 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane in mice and by para-chloroamphetamine in rats were antagonized by AD-5423 at much lower doses (0.5-2 mg/kg p.o.) than those of haloperidol and clozapine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

There are specific disorders requiring specific treatments within each group. Effective treatments exist for most disorders. Effective treatment for delirium consists of identifying and treating an underlying cause, and the judicious use of medications for specific symptoms. Treatment for the dementias involves two considerations: (1) treatment of the cognitive symptoms; and (2) treatment of the behavioral symptoms. There are no currently FDA-approved, or generally acknowledged as effective, medications for the cognitive symptoms. Some medications marketed for other purposes may be used by some clinicians for treating cognitive symptoms. One medication, tacrine, is available under a treatment IND for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Behavioral symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations, and delusions occur in a majority of patients some time during their illness. The treatment of behavioral symptoms involves behavioral management, environmental manipulations, and the use of medication for control of specific syndromes. The few medications assessed in randomized trials include neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Neuroleptics such as haloperidol or thioridazine are modestly effective for some symptoms and are probably the treatments of choice for the acute, short-term. Benzodiazepines may be somewhat less effective, have cognitive-impairing side effects, are associated with increased falls, and, therefore, are less preferred. Many other medications have been suggested based largely on clinical experience. They include carbamazepine, trazodone, buspirone, and others. Treatment for depression involves consideration of acute and maintenance treatment, and of the type and severity of illness. For an acute depressive disorder of great severity, or with melancholia or psychosis either electroconvulsive therapy or the combination of antidepressant and neuroleptics may be required. Treatment requires adequate prescribing, patient education, and regular patient monitoring for compliance, symptom change, side effects, and intercurrent medical disorders which may complicate antidepressant therapy. Both antidepressant medications and brief structured psychotherapies, such as interpersonal or cognitive psychotherapies, have efficacy in the acute treatment of elderly depressed outpatients with major unipolar, nondelusional depression. Maintenance treatments are important, however, to prevent relapses or repeated episodes. Treatment recommendations are discussed. The mainstay of treatment for psychotic disorders such as late-onset schizophrenia and late-onset delusional disorder are neuroleptics. Clinical course is variable; maintenance treatments are required. Neuroleptic side effects occur with greater frequency than in younger patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "66": "As has been demonstrated in the numerous studies cited in this report, there are multiple effective treatments for panic disorder (PD), both pharmacological and psychosocial. Available evidence documents that at least 75 percent of patients will have a good response to three classes of medications (tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, benzodiazepines) which are all approximately equal in efficacy and side effects. Medications may be even more effective when combined with cognitive and behavioral techniques. Several of the psychosocial treatments are also quite effective and appear to have certain advantages, including a low relapse rate. Currently a cognitive treatment specific for panic disorder is under active study and appears especially promising. It is clear that both pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments for panic disorder are effective and can reduce or eliminate the multiple symptoms (panic attacks, phobic avoidance, depression, etc.) and the secondary disability in occupational and social and family roles associated with panic disorder. Untreated, panic disorder patients appear to generally remain chronically ill and worsen over time. What is less clear are issues of length of treatment, outcome after treatment is discontinued, relationship of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments, effect of comorbid disorders and presence of subclinical symptoms, and patient characteristics which predict a positive response. The relatively recent finding that panic disorder is a common condition, occurring in about 1-2 percent of the population within any 6-month period (Weissman 1990) has stimulated clinical interest in the development of effective interventions. Until the early 1980s available treatments were generally ineffective, leaving approximately 75 percent of patients unimproved (Doctor 1982). However, excellent pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments are now available and provide significant improvement with complete resolution of symptoms and disability in the majority of patients. The advances in the knowledge base about panic disorder were underscored in the National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference held September 25-27, 1991 at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. These conferences are convened periodically by the National Institutes of Health to evaluate available scientific evidence, resolve issues of both safety and treatment efficacy, and make these advances known to the public. One of the primary conclusions from this conference is that \"Panic disorder is a distinct condition with a specific presentation, course, and positive family history and for which there are effective pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments\" (Panic Consensus Statement 1991).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "67": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography method for determination of benzodiazepine derivatives has been developed. Oxazepam and diazepam was determined in serum and oxazepam in urine.", 
    "68": "High effectiveness of a method for anesthesia with inclusion eglonyl into a composition of the polycomponent mixture, which permits to use the minimum doses of phentanyl, calipsol and diazepam, is shown. The method is easy to control, it permits to reduce the operative and anesthesiologic risk. Its use is contraindicated in pronounced hypovolemia and neurologic diseases with extrapyramidal disorders.", 
    "69": "We have previously shown that the selective peripheral-type benzodiazepine agonist 4'-chlordiazepam inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion from rat pancreatic islets. The present work was designed to further investigate the mechanism of this effect. Since interactions have been described between benzodiazepines and purinergic modulators such as adenosine, we studied the effect of the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline. This substance, which on its own had no effect on insulin release, prevented the inhibiting effect of 4'-chlordiazepam. We then performed experiments in the presence of forskolin, which directly stimulates adenylyl-cyclase, and dibutyryl-cyclic AMP, which enhances the intracellular cAMP content. The inhibiting effect of 4'-chlordiazepam was prevented neither by forskolin nor dibutyryl-cAMP, in contrast to the inhibiting effect of adenosine, which has been previously shown to be prevented by dibutyryl-cAMP. In conclusion, the inhibiting effect of 4'-chlordiazepam on glucose-induced insulin secretion is antagonized by 8-phenyltheophylline; the signalling mechanism of this effect appears to be independent of the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathway.", 
    "70": "The use of sedation and monitoring in gastrointestinal endoscopy is still open for debate. In The Netherlands, generally, no systemic sedation is used for relatively simple procedures like diagnostic upper GI endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. In most centres, for more time-consuming and burdensome endoscopies like colonoscopy, ERCP, sclerotherapy and therapeutic procedures, some form of sedation is applied. In a survey among a number of University Hospitals in The Netherlands it was shown that the sedatives mostly used are midazolam and diazepam. In more complex endoscopies these sedatives are often combined with narcotics like pethidine, morphine, fentanyl or thalamonal. Equipment to monitor the effect of these compounds on respiratory or cardiovascular function is not routinely available. However, there is a tendency towards the use of monitoring equipment and more specific to the use of pulse oximetry. Endpoints of conscious sedation are anxiolysis, amnesia and cooperation; it should not lead to ptosis, dysarthria and drowsiness. Features of drugs for conscious sedation should include these aforementioned points as well as a defined dose-effect relationship and a broad therapeutic window. Furthermore, they should be water soluble and give rapid recovery. Signs of oversedation are hypotension, bradycardia and respiratory depression. Competitive antagonists to the receptor, like flumazenil, can reverse overdosage of benzodiazepine sedatives. The sedative of choice at this moment is midazolam. When a benzodiazepine is combined with a narcotic, the narcotic should be given first and the dosage of the sedative adjusted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of flumazenil when used for recovery after midazolam-induced sedation in short acting, out-patient procedure like interruption of early pregnancy. A significantly faster recovery of the patients after injection of flumazenil was observed. When flumazenil was not used, patients remained drowsy, worse oriented, and less co-operative at 1.5 and 20 min after completion of abortion. There were no significant difference between the groups with and without flumazenil at the 60 min. In conclusion when it is possible to observe the patients for more than one hour, the application of flumazenil after sedation with midazolam is not necessary.", 
    "72": "In a comparative study, the efficacy of flumazenil, when used for recovery after midazolam-induced sedation for outpatient procedures, was assessed in two groups of women undergoing early termination of pregnancy at a university maternity ward. The 1st group of 32 women received flumazenil immediately after the procedure, while the 2nd group did not. The 2nd group consisted of 30 women who underwent early abortion (10-11 weeks). Their average age was 29.9 years (range, 18-42 years); their weight averaged 60.6 kg (range, 43-72 kg). Premedication consisted of 0.5 mg of venous atropine. The average dose of anesthesia with midazolam amounted to 15.08 mg per patient. The patients fell asleep within 1-3 minutes after receiving the drug (average, 1.87 minutes). The average time of awakening was 6.6 minutes (range, 2-20 minutes). The average duration of the procedure was 5.45 minutes (range, 3-14 minutes). Awakening and getting up were evaluated according to the modified scheme of Stewart after 1, 5, 20, and 60 minutes. Phase 1 meant that the patient did not open her eyes and did not react to a command; Phase 2 occurred when the patient opened her eyes and responded to the command; Phase 3 occurred when the patient was in light sleep and moments later opened her eyes; and Phase 4 occurred when the patient fully awakened, opened her eyes, and began to talk. Correlation analysis showed a significant reverse relationship between the speed of recovery after administration of midazolam and the administration of flumazenil at 5 minutes (r = - 0.8) and at 20 minutes (r = - 0.9), but at 60 minutes the differences were evened out (r = - 0.32). When flumazenil was not used the patients remained drowsy at 1, 5, and 20 minutes after completion of abortion. When the patients can be observed for more than 1 hour, the administration of flumazenil after sedation with midazolam is not necessary.", 
    "73": "The concentration-time curves of diazepam exhibited double peaks after i.v. 5 mg.kg-1 to 6 rabbits. A pharmacokinetic model taking account of enterogastric circulation was proposed to explain this double-peak phenomenon and showed good agreement with data. This model provides not only the ordinary pharmacokinetic parameters: T1/2 (alpha) = 0.21 +/- 0.15 h, T1/2 (beta) = 2.2 +/- 0.6 h, Ke = 1.5 +/- 0.6 h-1, K12 = 2.0 +/- 1.0 h-1, K21 = 1.0 +/- 0.4 h-1, V1 = 3.1 +/- 1.6 L.kg-1, AUC = 1.7 +/- 0.5 microgram.h-1.ml-1, but also the parameters of enterogastric circulation of diazepam: lag time of reabsorption T' = 0.25 +/- 0.24 h, reabsorption rate constant Ka = 3.5 +/- 1.4 h-1, reabsorption rate Ra = 24 +/- 7%.", 
    "74": "The acute administration of some benzodiazepines in normoglycemic rats induced only minor changes of the blood glucose levels. In Triton WR-1339 administered rats, the benzodiazepines brought about minor modifications of this parameter. However, in diabetic rats (streptozotocin-induced diabetes), diazepam administered subacutely elicited very significant diminutions of glycemia. This was due, at least partly, to an increase of the glucose uptake by the skeletal muscle.", 
    "75": "The present paper delineates some of the current opinions as well as our own experiences with pharmacologic antagonists in anaesthetic practice. Non specific (Aminophylline, Physostigmine) as well as specific-opiate and benzodiazepine antagonists are therapeutic agents which cans shorten time of awakening or reverse respiratory depression induced by different anaesthetic drugs.", 
    "76": "Changes in middle cerebral arterial flow velocity (MCAV) during rapid intravenous induction and awake intubation using transcranial Doppler sonography were investigated. The study involved 20 patients without disorders of the central nervous or cardiovascular systems who were scheduled for maxillofacial surgery. In the intravenous induction group, anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, and orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation was facilitated with succinylcholine chloride or alcuronium chloride. In the awake intubation group, orotracheal or nasotracheal intubation was performed under intravenous sedation with diazepam and topical anesthesia with 4% lidocaine. Arterial blood pressures, heart rate, and MCAV were monitored at specific intervals. During intravenous induction, blood pressures decreased after the administration of thiopental and muscle relaxants and increased during endotracheal intubation. MCAV was remarkably slowed after the administration of thiopental and during mask ventilation. During awake intubation, blood pressures were increased by endotracheal intubation. MCAV was decreased from the administration of diazepam to the transtracheal injection of lidocaine, but returned to the control value from endotracheal spray to endotracheal intubation. These results suggest that smooth awake intubation may be the safest method of induction for patients with cerebrovascular disorders.", 
    "77": "This double-blind, controlled clinical trial assessed the anxiety relief provided by oral triazolam given before intravenous sedation. Twenty-two healthy adults undergoing third-molar surgery with intravenous sedation were enrolled in this study. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 0.25 mg of triazolam p.o. or an identically appearing placebo 45 to 60 min before venipuncture. Immediately before test drug administration, subjects completed the Corah Anxiety Scale, a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assessing state anxiety, and the Interval Scale of Anxiety Response (ISAR). The VAS and ISAR were repeated immediately before venipuncture. Intravenous sedation medications consisted of fentanyl, midazolam, and methohexital. At 24 hr, assessments of the venipuncture and global experience were obtained. Results indicated that the characteristics of the triazolam and placebo patients were similar at baseline. With triazolam pretreatment, both the VAS and ISAR scores decreased significantly. Dose requirements for conscious sedation medications were decreased in the triazolam group. Patients rated the venipuncture experience significantly less unpleasant when pretreated with triazolam, and global ratings of the overall surgical experience favored triazolam. An oral-intravenous combination sedation technique using 0.25 mg of triazolam may have a significant therapeutic advantage for outpatient oral surgery.", 
    "78": "For the establishment of screening-test and identification of 20 benzodiazepines (Alprazolam, Bromazepam, Chlordiazepoxide, Clonazepam, Clotiazepam, Cloxazolam, Diazepam, Estazolam, Fludiazepam, Flunitrazepam, Flurazepam, Lorazepam, Lormetazepam, Medazolam, Midazepam, Nimetazepam, Nitrazepam, Oxazepam, Prazepam, Triazolam), the optimum separation condition on HPLC was investigated by using Interactive Computer Optimization for HPLC Separation (ICOS) software. The two eluent systems of 0.02M KH2PO4 (pH 3.1)-methanol-acetonitrile (66.4:5.7:27.9) and 0.1% TFA-methanol-acetonitrile (61.6:16.1:22.3) were selected by HPLC analyses using ICOS. These optimum separation conditions enabled the screening test and identification of the 20 benzodiazepines on HPLC with photodiode array detection.", 
    "79": "Prolonged benzodiazepine treatment of rats results in anticonvulsant tolerance in vivo. Studies of in vitro hippocampal slices following 1 wk flurazepam administration show reduced GABA-mediated inhibition in the CA1 region, and a decrease in GABAA agonist and benzodiazepine potency to inhibit CA1 pyramidal cell-evoked responses. To investigate the molecular basis of benzodiazepine tolerance in the hippocampus, in situ hybridization techniques were used to evaluate the expression of the mRNAs for the alpha 1, alpha 5, and gamma 2 subunits of the GABAA receptor in the hippocampal formation and frontal cortex of chronic flurazepam-treated rats. A discretely localized decrease in alpha 1, but not alpha 5 or gamma 2 mRNA expression was found in the CA1 region (35-40%) and in layers II-III and IV of cortex (50-60%) 2 d after cessation of flurazepam treatment. The decrease in the expression of alpha 1 subunit mRNA in cortex is similar to that reported following other chronic benzodiazepine treatment regimens. This is the first report of a reduction in alpha 1 subunit mRNA expression in the hippocampal formation.", 
    "80": "Benzodiazepines (BDZ), the most popular drug of choice for treating anxiety disorders, present side-effects such as sedation, muscular disorders, abuse liability and synergistic effect with alcohol and CNS depressant drugs. At present, pharmacological research is focusing to find anxiolytic drugs as efficacious as benzodiazepines but without side-effects. This review reports the status of the pharmaceutical research and development on novel drugs for the treatment of anxiety disorders. A close analysis of the items selected by the N5C \"Pharmaprojects\" search (anxiolytic class) yielded the following classification: A) Drugs interacting with the GABA-A receptor complex, which includes BDZ-like drugs, partial BDZ agonists (beta-carbolines) and drugs interacting with the GABA-A complex through an as yet unidentified mechanism (15 compounds), B) Drugs acting as CCK-B antagonists (5 compounds), C) Drugs interacting with serotonergic function (30 compounds) subdivided into: (i) agonists at the 5-HT1A receptor, (ii) antagonists at the 5-HT2 receptor, and (iii) antagonists at the 5-HT3 receptor; D) Drugs with other mechanisms (22 compounds). Based on these results, it is not possible to identify a common mechanism through which the selected drugs under development exert their anxiolytic effect. Therefore, it appears that different biological mechanisms are specifically involved in the different anxiety disorders.", 
    "81": "The authors provide the data on the etiological role played by higher aliphatic amines of the fatty series in the development of borderline neuropsychic disorders. The dopamine system was shown to play the leading part in their genesis. Activation of that system goes in parallel with disorders in immune and neuromediator homeostasis. Leukopenia, lymphocytosis, inhibition of T system immunity, a rise of the B lymphocyte count, beta-lysine, expression, of acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, histamine, serotonin, GABA, opiate and benzodiazepine receptors by immunocompetent cells were revealed. It has been demonstrated that the changes in the count of rosette-forming cells immune to neuromediators reflect the disease development and can be used as objective criteria for the diagnosis and treatment policy for borderline neuropsychic disorders caused by higher aliphatic amines of the fatty series.", 
    "82": "This paper describes pharmacological treatments that can reverse the anxiogenic response detected in animal tests when rats are withdrawn from chronic treatment with diazepam. Concurrent treatment with the calcium channel antagonist verapamil prevented this withdrawal response and the benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist flumazenil reversed the anxiogenic response and restored the system to a drug-naive state. Other treatments that reversed the anxiogenic response were the GABAB agonist baclofen, the 5-HT1A receptor agonist buspirone, and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (R,S)-zacopride (GABA = gamma-aminobutyric acid; 5-HT = 5-hydroxytryptamine). Both the enantiomers of zacopride contributed to this reversal. These behavioural reversals are interpreted in the light of biochemical studies showing increased 45Ca2+ flux and [3H]5-HT release from the hippocampus, during benzodiazepine withdrawal (Fig. 1).", 
    "83": "In this paper it is argued that drugs of abuse act on specific neurotransmitter pathways and by this mechanism elicit neurochemical changes that mimic some aspects of the overall pattern of the neurochemical effects of natural rewarding stimuli. Thus, drugs of abuse are biochemically homologous to specific aspects of natural rewarding stimuli. The behavioral similarity between drugs of abuse and natural stimuli, including that of being rewarding, results from their common property of activating neurochemically specific pathways. Natural stimuli accomplish this result indirectly through their sensory properties and incentive learning while drugs stimulate by a direct central action the critical reward pathways. Many drugs of abuse mimic the incentive properties of natural stimuli and their ability to stimulate mesolimbic dopamine pathways (Fig. 1). Both natural rewards and drugs of abuse, including amphetamine, cocaine and other psychostimulants, preferentially stimulate dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic nucleus accumbens compared with the dorsal caudate, an area related to the extrapyramidal motor system. Although many drugs of abuse mimic the incentive aspect of natural reward, this is probably not an absolute prerequisite for conferring to a drug some abuse liability. It might be predicted that certain drugs might be abused as a result of their action at sites located beyond dopamine or by mimicking other aspects of naturally rewarding stimuli such as the 'functional' (or trophotropic). This might be the case with opiates (which also mimic the 'incentive' aspect) and of benzodiazepines, as a result of activation of the central opioid reward system and of the central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine system respectively. The hypothesis appears to have heuristic value as it predicts that biochemical mechanisms important for the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse are expected to play a role also in natural reward. One test of this hypothesis is offered by the observation that the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system, through 5-HT3 receptors, and the central opioid system, through delta-opioid receptors, can contribute to the mechanism of the dopamine-activating properties of certain drugs of abuse. On this basis it would be predicted that drugs acting on 5-HT3 and on delta-opioid receptors would interfere with or mimic certain aspects of natural rewarding stimuli.", 
    "84": "Potential development of tolerance to and dependence on benzodiazepine tranquilizers often limit their use for long-term treatment of epilepsy, anxiety and insomnia. Current developments in benzodiazepine receptor pharmacology, i.e. the advent of partial agonists and receptor subtype specific agonists (Fig. 1), however, might eventually overcome these limitations, thus greatly improving therapeutic prospects. The present study demonstrates that subchronic administration of alprazolam (a high-efficacy agonist) results in strong withdrawal reactions upon injection of a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist in mice and monkeys. The partial agonist bretazenil, as well as the benzodiazepine receptor type 1-preferring agonist zolpidem, however, are much less prone to producing such reactions. Neurochemical studies showed that subchronic infusion of lorazepam (a high-efficacy agonist), in contrast to betrazenil, led to benzodiazepine receptor downregulation in vivo and reduced potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-stimulated chloride flux by diazepam ex vivo. These findings indicate that partial and receptor subtype 1-selective agonists differ from full, non-selective agonists in their liability to induce drug dependence and tolerance upon chronic administration. It is hypothesized that the neurochemical basis of these adaptive phenomena may be receptor downregulation and/or reduced coupling between GABAA receptor/chloride channel gating and benzodiazepine receptor binding.", 
    "85": "When benzodiazepines were introduced into clinical practice in the 1950s they were hailed as efficacious minor tranquillizers, largely devoid of unwanted side effects, in contrast to the barbiturates and similar drugs that they largely superseded. It was 30 years before the phenomenon of low-dose dependence on benzodiazepines was recognized. Benzodiazepine dependence differs from other psychotropic drug addictions because the benzodiazepines do not produce either euphoria or drug-seeking behaviour (except in those who are already addicted to other drugs). However, benzodiazepine use is associated in some individuals with a marked withdrawal (abstinence) syndrome that provides the best evidence of dependence. Just over half the people prescribed long-term benzodiazepines do not develop any sign of a withdrawal reaction (Fig. 1): this reflects factors including the type of benzodiazepine prescribed, the dosage and duration of treatment, as well as characteristics of the patient. Individuals with passive-dependent personalities appear to be more likely to experience withdrawal symptoms than other patients, although this remains a controversial issue. Therefore benzodiazepine use should follow certain guidelines, and if these are adhered to the benzodiazepines will continue to be valuable drugs in clinical practice.", 
    "86": "This study evaluated an automated high performance liquid chromatography algorithm that allows identification of 330 substances and metabolites in biological fluids. We assessed its ability to detect in urine and gastric lavage fluids the main psychotropic drugs ingested with suicidal intent. Antidepressants and most of the phenothiazines were recognised; identification of benzodiazepines was more uncertain. Compared to EMIT techniques, chromatography is less sensitive, but allows precise identification of the offending poison, quantifies the amount, and allows broad toxicological screening of pharmacological classes inaccessible to the EMIT technique.", 
    "87": "Drug Use in Pregnancy (DUP) is an international epidemiological survey of drug use in pregnancy conducted from 1988 to 1990 in 148 maternity wards, representing the general delivery practices of 22 countries. Data on exposure of pregnant women to psychotropic drugs, the indications for their use and their correlation with maternal characteristics are reported. Of the 14,778 women interviewed, 520 (3.5%) reported 562 courses of psychotropic drugs. Benzodiazepines (BDZ) accounted for the greatest number of the exposures (444/520 women); neuroleptics and antidepressants were prescribed to tiny minorities of women (83 and 17 respectively), mostly in those few countries were the overall prevalence of use of those drugs was highest. Throughout the majority of the other countries, overall rates were in the low range and were rather heterogeneous. With the exception of small clusters of \"unexpected\" indications, prescriptions of BDZ were found to be consistent with the target symptoms of anxiety and insomnia; chronic use was reported in 31/444 women. The study was not targeted to the detection of malformations; no suspected clustering was found, however, among the 130 women exposed during the first trimester of pregnancy. The collaborative network now established provides a framework for periodically replicated surveillance to monitor the evolution of this field of knowledge and care in order to provide reliable information for women and society.", 
    "88": "The legal requirement to use least restrictive interventions in emergency psychiatric treatment does not stipulate whether physical restraints or medication is least restrictive. There is no current consensus about how to determine least restrictive interventions in a generalizable manner. In this study patients who were clients in a public psychiatric emergency service were anonymously surveyed and asked to state their preferences for specific interventions in a psychiatric emergency. In a choice between physical restraints versus psychotropic medication, 64 percent of clients preferred medication; 36 percent preferred seclusion or restraint. The rank order of preferred modality was 1) benzodiazepines--31 percent, 2) neuroleptics--26 percent, 3) seclusion--24 percent, 4) restraints--10 percent. The rank order of last choice was different. Patients preference is an important factor in determining the appropriate intervention in an emergency. Patient participation offers an opportunity reconcile to clinical and legal objectives, to i improve compliance, and to enhance patient and staff safety."
