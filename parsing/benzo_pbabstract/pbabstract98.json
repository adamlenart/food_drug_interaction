We show that the inducing effect of NRB on the PT (i) is inhibited by the selective ligands of the 18kDa outer membrane (OMM) translocator protein (TSPO, formerly peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) protoporphyrin IX, N,N-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide and 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one; and (ii) is lost in digitonin mitoplasts, which lack an intact OMM. In mitoplasts the PT can still be induced by the NRB cationic derivative OL14, which contrary to NRB is also effective in intact mitochondria from mouse and guinea pig. We conclude that selective NRB transport into rat mitochondria occurs via TSPO in the OMM, which allows its translocation to PT-regulating sites in the inner membrane. Thus, species-specificity of NRB toward the rat PT depends on subtle differences in the structure of TSPO or of TSPO-associated proteins affecting its substrate specificity.", 
    "1": "MYC contributes to the pathogenesis of a majority of human cancers, yet strategies to modulate the function of the c-Myc oncoprotein do not exist. Toward this objective, we have targeted MYC transcription by interfering with chromatin-dependent signal transduction to RNA polymerase, specifically by inhibiting the acetyl-lysine recognition domains (bromodomains) of putative coactivator proteins implicated in transcriptional initiation and elongation. Using a selective small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, we identify BET bromodomain proteins as regulatory factors for c-Myc. BET inhibition by JQ1 downregulates MYC transcription, followed by genome-wide downregulation of Myc-dependent target genes. In experimental models of multiple myeloma, a Myc-dependent hematologic malignancy, JQ1 produces a potent antiproliferative effect associated with cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Efficacy of JQ1 in three murine models of multiple myeloma establishes the therapeutic rationale for BET bromodomain inhibition in this disease and other malignancies characterized by pathologic activation of c-Myc.",

    "3": "In the present study, we investigated the effect of the Kampo medicine Yokukansan (YKS) on pentobarbital-induced sleep in group-housed and socially isolated mice. Socially isolated mice showed shorter sleeping time than the group-housed mice. YKS (300 mg/kg, p.o.) prolonged the pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in socially isolated mice without affecting pentobarbital sleep in group-housed mice. The prolongation of sleeping time by YKS was reversed by bicuculline (3 mg/kg, i.p.) and flumazenil (3 mg/kg, i.p.), but not WAY100635. These findings suggest that the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, but not 5-HT(1A) receptors, is involved in the reversal effect of YKS on the decrease of pentobarbital sleep by social isolation.",

A simple sampling scheme was established collecting 3 blood samples at 0, 4, and 24 hours followed by solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis. After addition of 8 deuterated internal standards and extraction, the analytes were separated using gradient elution with ammonium acetate and methanol. Data acquisition was performed on a triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer in multiple-reaction monitoring mode with positive electrospray ionization. The assay was validated according to international guidelines: limits of quantification (LOQs) were between 0.25 and 1.0 ng/mL for all analytes, except for paraxanthine and caffeine (20 ng/mL). Extraction efficiencies ranged between 77% and 103% and matrix effects between 23% and 95%; precision and accuracy data fulfilled accepted criteria. Calibration curves from LOQ to 1000 ng/mL were established for undiluted and 1:10 diluted plasma (r > 0.998). The method was tested in a pilot study with 14 volunteers.

    "5": "Urine is recognized as the prime matrix for drug test screening with well-established methods and testing protocols. Its major limitation is with regard to the inconvenience of sample collection and lack of integrity due to adulteration, dilution, drug spiking or sample exchange. The question is whether oral fluid, with its apparent better sample integrity, can replace urine for drug screening. This review examines the sample integrity problems and the advantages and limitations of oral fluid and urine in drug screening programmes. The variety of sample collection devices for oral fluid is shown to be a problem with recovery and detection for some drugs. This is examined in relation to the pharmacokinetics of drug metabolism and excretion in this matrix. Buccal contamination with drugs in oral fluid may also cause problems with interpretation. The clinical advantages of oral fluid analysis compared with urine testing are highlighted. Parent drugs are often found in oral fluid where only their metabolites may be found in urine, for example the benzodiazepines. 6-Monoacetylmorphine, an indicative marker of heroin, has a high prevalence in oral fluid from users of this drug but its detection in urine is limited due to its short half-life. Advances in analytical techniques, particularly chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry, are helping to promote oral fluid analysis. However, the lack of concordance studies examining both urine and oral fluid drug levels and kinetics in the clinical setting is of some concern.",

Does the additional use of propofol, in subanesthetic doses, increase the risk of exposure to hypoxemia? Three thousand five hundred cases generated between 1996 and 2006 were randomly examined and divided into 2 subcohorts: 1750 patients were sedated with midazolam and fentanyl, and 1750 patients received propofol, in subanesthetic increments, in addition to midazolam and fentanyl. Initial sedation was established using midazolam and fentanyl in both subcohorts. The second subcohort received propofol during times of noxious stimulation. Patient exposure to 2 or more oxygen desaturations below 94% was uncommon. The variables that were significantly associated with low saturations were age, gender, and weight. Neither the dose of midazolam nor the additional use of propofol was a significant risk factor. ASA classification (I or II) was not a determinant of risk.

We report a direct interaction between the GABA(A)R \u03b13 subunit and gephyrin, mapping reciprocal binding sites using mutagenesis, overlay, and yeast two-hybrid assays. This analysis reveals that critical determinants of this interaction are located in the motif FNIVGTTYPI in the GABA(A)R \u03b13 M3-M4 domain and the motif SMDKAFITVL at the N terminus of the gephyrin E domain. GABA(A)R \u03b13 gephyrin binding-site mutants were unable to co-localize with endogenous gephyrin in transfected hippocampal neurons, despite being able to traffic to the cell membrane and form functional benzodiazepine-responsive GABA(A)Rs in recombinant systems. Interestingly, motifs responsible for interactions with GABA(A)R \u03b12, GABA(A)R \u03b13, and collybistin on gephyrin overlap. Curiously, two key residues (Asp-327 and Phe-330) in the GABA(A)R \u03b12 and \u03b13 binding sites on gephyrin also contribute to GlyR \u03b2 subunit-E domain interactions. However, isothermal titration calorimetry reveals a 27-fold difference in the interaction strength between GABA(A)R \u03b13 and GlyR \u03b2 subunits with gephyrin with dissociation constants of 5.3 \u03bcm and 0.2 \u03bcm, respectively.

The greatest mean GFR values were for the medetomidine-butorphanol and ketamine-midazolam protocols. There were no significant differences between observers for calculation of GFR.", 
    "67": "Results suggested that none of the 3 sedation protocols had significant effects on GFR calculated by use of quantitative renal scintigraphy, compared with results for GFR evaluations performed in the cats when they were not sedated. No significant interobserver error was evident. However, the statistical power of this study was low, and the probability of a type II error was high.", 
    "68": "In atherosclerotic internal carotid artery (ICA) or middle cerebral artery (MCA) disease, selective neuronal damage can be detected as a decrease in central benzodiazepine receptors (BZRs) in an apparently normal cerebral cortex. To investigate the association between cortical BZRs decreases and executive dysfunctions, we measured BZRs using positron emission tomography (PET) and (11)C-flumazenil in 60 non-disabled patients with unilateral atherosclerotic ICA or MCA disease and no cortical infarction. Using 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projections, we calculated the BZR index, a measure of abnormally decreased BZRs in the cerebral cortex within the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or MCA territory, and found that it to be correlated with the patient's score on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Based on the WCST results, 39 patients were considered abnormal (low categories achieved) for their age. The BZR index of the ACA territory in the hemisphere affected by arterial disease was significantly higher in abnormal patients than in normal patients. The BZR index of the MCA territory differed significantly between the 2 groups when patients with left arterial disease (n = 28) were analyzed separately. The BZR indices of the anterior cingulate gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus carrelated significantly and positively with the total number of WCST errors. In atherosclerotic ICA or MCA disease, selective neuronal damage that is manifested as a decrease in BZRs in the non-infarcted cerebral cortex is associated with executive dysfunction. PET imaging of BZRs is useful as an objective measure of cognitive impairments in atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the major cerebral artery.",

    "71": "The phrenic nerve displayed an augmenting discharge during inspiration and arrest of discharge during expiration in normal condition. Administration of morphine (0.3-10.0mg/kg) dose-dependently provoked apneusis characterized by a long-lasting, plateau inspiratory discharge of the phrenic nerve. It shortened the expiratory duration. Subsequent administration of physostigmine (0.1mg/kg) restored the morphine-induced apneusis to eupnea with a partial recovery of the augmenting inspiratory discharge. This modification of physostigmine was blocked by a non-specific muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (3.0mg/kg), leading to re-prolongation of inspiration. A similar antagonism was affected by an antagonist of M3 cholinergic receptors, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP, 1.0 and 10.0mg/kg) but not by an antagonist of M1 cholinergic receptors, pirenzepine (1.0 and 10.0mg/kg).",

The study had a crossover design where every patient received two different sedation regimens i.e. oral midazolam 0.6 mg/kg alone and oral midazolam 0.6 mg/kg with nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation during two dental treatment visits. Thirty children (17 males and 13 females) were selected for the study with mean age of 55.07 (+/- 9.29) months. Safety of the two regimens was evaluated by monitoring hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, blood pressure & oxygen saturation) and through observing the child for 24 hours post-sedation for any side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Very few changes in hemodynamics were noted from baseline during both the visits. However, the mean oxygen saturation level with oral midazolam and nitrous oxide-oxygen was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than oral midazolam alone. Postoperative side effects were very few and mainly remained limited to post-sedation drowsiness. It can be concluded that oral midazolam (0.6 mg/kg) alone and oral midazolam (0.6 mg/kg) plus nitrous oxide (30%-50%) sedation are both safe while providing dental treatment to children with behavior problems.",

An increasing number of studies suggest that regular cannabis users can show psychotic episodes similar to schizophrenic disorders but it still unclear if cannabis induced psychotic disorder is a distinct entity requiring special therapy or regular cannabis use consequently leads to schizophrenia. Therefore, we retrospectively compared psychotic patients with and without cannabis use by clinical profile. Clinical data of 85 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder were analyzed retrospectively. Cannabis use was not reported by 43 persons (Cnbs0 subgroup) and 42 patients used regularly cannabis during at least 1 year (Cnbs1 subgroup). Clinical data were collected from electronic medical documentation of patients concerning anamnesis, family history, socio-demographic condition, symptoms and psychiatric state, acute and long-term therapies. Men were over-represented in the cannabis abuser group while mean age was lower among them compared to the Cnbs0 subgroup. Prevalence of suicidal attempts was increased in men without cannabis use. Patients without cannabis use spent more time in hospital and smoking was more frequent among them. Positive and negative symptoms and family history did not differ significantly between the two subgroups. Dosage, intensity and length of pharmacotherapy was different between the two subgroups. These results revealed that certain clinical aspects were different in case of cannabis-related schizophrenia spectrum disorder compared to schizophrenia.",

After methanolic and methanolic/aqueous extraction, the analytes were separated using two different LC-MS systems (AB Sciex 3200 QTRAP and AB Sciex 5500 QTRAP). Separation columns, mobile phases and MS modes for both systems were: Phenomenex Kinetex, 2.6 \u03bcm, 50/2.1; 5mM ammonium formate buffer pH 3.5/methanol, total flow 0.75 mL/min; electrospray ionization (ESI), multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), information dependent acquisition (IDA), enhanced product ion scan (EPI). The assays were found to be selective for the tested compounds (alprazolam, 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, N-desalkylflurazepam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, alpha-hydroxymidazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, nordazepam, oxazepam, phenazepam, prazepam, temazepam, triazolam, zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone), all validation criteria were in the required ranges according to international guidelines, except for bromazepam.

Analysis of the total ion current showed that the compounds reduce the rate of inward Na+- and Ca2+ currents and of outward K+-currents.", 
    "91": "Reported findings indicate that attentional narrowing is related to decreased complexity and increased inhibition of neural assemblies. These findings suggest that analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG) complexity could present a useful method for research of attentional changes related to dissociation. To examine this model we used a case study to test the two hypotheses: (1) that successful anticonvulsant medication would result in dissociative symptom alleviation, improvement of inhibitory neural functions, and decreased EEG complexity, and (2) that cognitive conflict, related to aversive events in the patient's past experience, during reliving of a dissociative state would lead to greater allocation of attention and decreased EEG complexity. Three EEG studies recorded in the eyes closed non-drowsy state were performed: (1) at baseline, (2) post-induction of dissociative state, and (3) post-anticonvulsant medication following induction of dissociative state. A dissociative state was achieved following an interview regarding the patient's aversive past experiences through use of the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ). The patient's level of dissociation was measured using the Dissociative Experiences Scale-II (DES-II). The PDEQ interview and DES-II assessment were also used one hour following the oral consumption of an anticonvulsant medication (clonazepam 2mg). Analysis of the data revealed that complexity values (PD2) are significantly lower following the oral consumption of clonazepam (2mg) in the majority of EEG channels. Additionally, complexity during the reliving of a dissociative state was statistically significantly lower than both the baseline and post-medication conditions in all but two EEG channels. Results of the case study suggest that changes in attentional processes linked to dissociation are related to: (1) decreased complexity when attention is extremely focused because of attentional narrowing to the disturbing past experience, and (2) increased complexity during ordinary experiences when attention is less narrowly focused.",

    "96": "Although a statement on Neonatal Drug Withdrawal was published in 1998 by the American Academy of Pediatrics, pharmacologic management of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) remains a challenge. Published clinical trials are limited, restricting treatment decision making to practitioner's experience and preference rather than evidence-based medicine. To optimize withdrawal symptom prevention, drug selection is often based on the offending agent (opioids versus polysubstance exposure), clinical presentation, mechanism of action (agonist versus partial agonist/antagonist, receptor effects), pharmacokinetic parameters and available drug formulations. This review addresses risk factors and pathophysiology of NAS, summarizes parameters of common drugs used for the management of NAS, and reviews published literature of standard therapies as well as newer agents. Based on the current literature, paregoric is no longer recommended and oral morphine solutions remain the mainstay of therapy for opiate withdrawal. Other potential therapies include methadone, buprenorphine, phenobarbital and clonidine with the latter two agents as adjunctive therapies.", 
    "97": "Hyperprolactinemia mediated by antagonism of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the pituitary gland is a common adverse effect of antipsychotics. Recent studies have suggested that polymorphisms of dopamine receptors can affect the therapeutic response to antipsychotics. Thus, our aim was to evaluate whether 2 such polymorphisms (DRD2 Taq1A and DRD3 Ser9Gly) modulate prolactin release in healthy volunteers (n = 119) receiving a single dose of quetiapine (25 mg, n = 26), olanzapine (5 mg, n = 57), or risperidone (1 mg, n = 36). The increases in maximum concentration and in area under the curve were calculated from plasma prolactin levels after subtraction of pretreatment levels. Multiple regression analyses revealed that prolactin increases in maximum concentration and in area under the curve depended on drug (quetiapine < olanzapine < risperidone; P < 0.001), sex (women > men; P < 0.001), and Taq1A polymorphism (A1\u207a > A2/A2; P < 0.05). Analysis of the individual drugs revealed that prolactin secretion was modulated by sex and Taq1A polymorphism in olanzapine and risperidone (P < 0.05); however, these factors were not linked to prolactin secretion in quetiapine.",

Eight studies met inclusion criteria, describing a total of at least 631 randomized patients. In the pooled results, there were no significant differences in efficacy between alprazolam and the comparator benzodiazepines on any of the prespecified outcomes: improvement in mean panic attack frequency (between-arm weighted mean difference of 0.6 panic attacks per week; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.3 to 1.6), improvement in Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score (weighted mean difference of 0.8 points; 95% CI, -0.5 to 2.1), and proportion of patients free of panic attacks at the final evaluation (pooled relative risk, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.4). Statistical heterogeneity on prespecified outcomes was not eliminated by stratification on baseline anxiety level. The available evidence fails to demonstrate alprazolam as superior to other benzodiazepines for the treatment of panic disorder.", 
    "99": "Despite reports of increasing non-medical prescription drug use, relatively few studies have systematically evaluated the prevalence and correlates of non-medical prescription drug use, particularly in populations that might be especially vulnerable (e.g., injection drug users [IDUs]). We examined factors associated with non-medical prescription drug use among a community-based cohort of current and former IDUs in Baltimore (The ALIVE Study). We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from cohort participants that responded to a survey that included questions on non-medical prescription drug use between 2005-06 (n=1320). Non-medical prescription drug use was considered to be use of any of the following: Opiates (Oxycontin, Percocet), Benzodiazepines or Clonidine, purchased on the street and taken orally within the last six months. Data on other covariates of interest (e.g., demographics, substance use, general health) was obtained through a standardized interview. The median age was 46 years; 66% were male, 85% were African-American. Twenty one percent reported any non-medical prescription drug use; 12% reported using more than one drug. Non-medical use of opiates was most common (17%). In multivariate analysis, non-medical prescription drug use was significantly associated with Caucasian race (prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.79), self-reported bodily pain (PR: 1.58), hazardous alcohol use (PR: 1.47), marijuana use (PR: 1.65), non-injection cocaine/heroin use (PR: 1.70), diverted use of buprenorphine (PR: 1.51) or methadone (PR: 2.51), and active injection drug use (PR: 3.50; p<0.05 for all). The association between bodily pain and non-medical prescription drug use was stronger among persons that were not using substances (marijuana, injecting drugs, snorting/smoking heroin, cocaine, using crack) as compared to those using these substances. The high prevalence of non-medical prescription drug use among this population warrants further research and action. Information on the risks of nonmedical prescription drug use especially overdose, should be incorporated into interventions targeted at IDUs.", 
    "100": "Chronic catatonia with posturing can cause joint contractures leading to greater morbidity associated with the physical deformity. We report a case of a young man with chronic catatonic schizophrenia with posturing of bilateral upper limbs in flexion leading to fixed flexion contracture of left metacarpophalangeal joints. Initiation of electroconvulsive therapy along with physical rehabilitation measures helped him regain full range of motion in the right upper limb. The fixed flexion contracture, however, remained resistant to intensive treatment efforts. Early interventions in the form of electroconvulsive therapy and physical rehabilitation can be useful in reversing such potentially disabling complications.", 
    "101": "The discovery that cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract express the same molecular receptors and intracellular signaling components known to be involved in taste has generated great interest in potential functions of such post-oral \"taste\" receptors in the control of food intake. To determine whether taste cues in the GI tract are detected and can directly influence behavior, the present study used a microbehavioral analysis of intake, in which rats drank from lickometers that were programmed to simultaneously deliver a brief yoked infusion of a taste stimulus to the intestines. Specifically, in daily 30-min sessions, thirsty rats with indwelling intraduodenal catheters were trained to drink hypotonic (0.12 M) sodium chloride (NaCl) and simultaneously self-infuse a 0.12 M NaCl solution. Once trained, in a subsequent series of intestinal taste probe trials, rats reduced licking during a 6-min infusion period, when a bitter stimulus denatonium benzoate (DB; 10 mM) was added to the NaCl vehicle for infusion, apparently conditioning a mild taste aversion. Presentation of the DB in isomolar lithium chloride (LiCl) for intestinal infusions accelerated the development of the response across trials and strengthened the temporal resolution of the early licking suppression in response to the arrival of the DB in the intestine. In an experiment to evaluate whether CCK is involved as a paracrine signal in transducing the intestinal taste of DB, the CCK-1R antagonist devazepide partially blocked the response to intestinal DB. In contrast to their ability to detect and avoid the bitter taste in the intestine, rats did not modify their licking to saccharin intraduodenal probe infusions. The intestinal taste aversion paradigm developed here provides a sensitive and effective protocol for evaluating which tastants-and concentrations of tastants-in the lumen of the gut can control ingestion.",

    "106": "The diffusion characteristics of fluoxetine HCl (FLX HCl) and olanzapine (OLZ) alone and in combination with each other were studied to determine their in vitro permeation behavior across a series of gelling agents through a cellulose membrane and human cadaver skin. Klucel 0.5% was selected as the optimal formulation to study their diffusion through human cadaver skin. The release profiles of drugs acting alone and in combinations were identical in the case of the cellulose membrane. However, with human cadaver skin, the permeation of FLX HCl in combination with OLZ drastically increased (732 \u00b5g) compared with the release of FLX HCl alone (43.7 \u00b5g), while the release of OLZ remained the same whether alone or in combination with FLX HCl (183.7 \u00b5g). The results indicate that OLZ enhances the diffusion of FLX HCl through the cadaver skin. Follow-up studies with OLZ were conducted to further investigate this phenomenon and have shown that OLZ enhancement properties are skin reversible as well as concentration dependent. Also, a variety of experiments with different hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules were conducted, and it was found that OLZ enhances the permeation of hydrophilic compounds, while it has no influence on lipophilic compounds. Finally, a number of compounds structurally related to OLZ were investigated as enhancers, and it was determined that piperazine ring attached to the tricyclic system of OLZ is essential for enhancement of FLX HCl (1,837 \u00b5g).",

    "115": "Benzodiazepines are potent psychoactive drugs used for their sedative and anxiolytic properties (1, 2). There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors, which have been designated as central benzodiazepine receptors (CBR) and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR, also known as translocator protein (TSPO)). The CBR is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled to the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, the PBR is a mitochondrial protein found in brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4).The brain has lower levels of PBR than do the peripheral tissues. Both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBR (5-7). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage that accompanies several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. PBRs have been studied in vivo by positron emission tomography (8) using 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-[(11)C]methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([(11)C]PK11195), an isoquinoline carboxamide with specific PBR antagonistic activity. [(11)C]PK11195 has been developed as a PET agent for non-invasive studies of microglia and macrophage activation in the brain, lung, and heart. However, accumulation of this tracer in the brain is limited. N-(2,5-Dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (DAA1106) was found to be a selective agonist for studying PBRs in the central nervous system (9, 10). DAA1106 was reported to have a higher affinity for PBRs in mitochondrial fractions of rat and monkey brains than PK11195 (9, 10). Therefore, both tracers are able to cross the normal cell membrane to reach the mitochondrial receptor sites. N-(5-Fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(18)F]FEDAA1106) and [(11)C]DAA1106 have been developed as potential PET ligands with highly selective and specific binding to PBR. N-Acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine (PBR28), which has an aryloxyanilide structure, has been shown to have high affinity and selectivity for PBR (11). N-Acetyl-N-(2-[(11)C]methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine ([(11)C]PBR28) has been developed for imaging PBR in the brain.",

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) enables early noninvasive characterization of biological tissues based on their water diffusion characteristics. Our objectives were to study the application of MRI for assessment of paraoxon-induced brain damage and the efficacy of antidotal treatments. Seventy-six rats were poisoned with paraoxon followed by treatment with atropine and obidoxime. The rats were then divided into five treatment groups consisting of midazolam after 1 or 30 min, scopolamine after 1 or 30\u2009min and a no anticonvulsant treatment group. Five untreated rats served as controls. Animals underwent MRI on days 1, 8, 15, 29 and 50 post poisoning. Histological evaluation was performed on representative rat brains. Acute DWMRI effects, such as enhancement of temporal brain regions, and chronic effects such as ventricular enlargement and brain atrophy, depicted on T\u2082-weighted MRI, were significantly more prominent in late anticonvulsant treatment groups. There was no significant difference between the neuroprotective effects of midazolam and scopolamine as shown by DWMRI. Early MRI abnormalities were found to correlate significantly with histological analysis of samples obtained 15\u2009days post treatment. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using DWMRI for depiction of early cytotoxic response to paraoxon and T\u2082-weighted MRI for later changes, thus enabling assessment of early/late brain damage as well as treatment efficacy in rats. The ability to depict these changes early and noninvasively may be applied clinically in the acute phase of organophosphate poisoning.",

Here we evaluated BDNF level in 398 blood samples including 138 controls, 56 preHD, and 204 HD subjects. We found that BDNF protein levels were not reliably different between groups, whether measured in plasma (52 controls, 26 preHD, 105 HD) or serum (39 controls, 5 preHD, 29 HD). Our experience, and a re-analysis of the literature highlighted that intra-group variability and methodological aspects affect this measurement, especially in serum. We also assessed BDNF mRNA levels in blood samples from 47 controls, 25 preHD, and 70 HD subjects, and found no differences among the groups. We concluded that levels of BDNF in human blood were not informative (mRNA levels or plasma protein level) nor reliable (serum protein levels) as HD biomarkers. We also wish to warn the scientific community in interpreting the significance of changes measured in BDNF protein levels in serum from patients suffering from different conditions.",

Diazepam withdrawal in mice was read out as intensification of the seizures induced by a subthreshold dose of pentetrazole. In rats, the withdrawal syndrome resulting from chronic administration of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam and temazepam was characterized by audiogenic seizures, hypermotility and weight loss. Administration of the non-selective NO synthase inhibitors N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) and N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) significantly attenuated the withdrawal syndrome (i.e., pentetrazole-induced seizures) in diazepam-dependent mice. L-NOARG significantly suppressed hypermotility in clonazepam-dependent rats and inhibited the decrease in body weight observed after 12 h of withdrawal in chlordiazepoxide- and clonazepam-dependent rats. Moreover, a clear propensity of L-NOARG to protect benzodiazepine-dependent rats against audiogenic seizures was observed. These findings suggest that the cGMP/NO system may participate in causing the signs of benzodiazepine withdrawal.", 
    "132": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of GABAergic and nitriergic modulation in the antianxiety effect of thymoquinone, a major constituent of Nigella sativa, in mice under unstressed and stressed conditions. Thymoquinone (10 and 20 mg/kg), methylene blue (1 mg/kg) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) were administered followed by behavioral testing using an elevated plus maze, the light/dark test and the social interaction test in both unstressed and stressed mice (mice subjected to 6 h immobilization). The effects of the above-mentioned drugs on plasma nitrite, a stable metabolite of nitric oxide (NO) and brain GABA content were also studied. Diazepam (2 mg/kg) produced significant anxiolytic-like effects only in unstressed mice. However, diazepam significantly increased the GABA content in both unstressed and stressed mice as compared with their respective control groups. Thymoquinone (10 and 20 mg/kg) produced significant antianxiety effects in unstressed mice without altering nitrite levels, but only the higher dose (20 mg/kg) of thymoquinone increased the GABA content in unstressed mice. In stressed mice, thymoquinone (20 mg/kg) showed anxiolytic effects, with a significant decrease in plasma nitrite and reversal of the decreased brain GABA content. Pre-treatment with methylene blue enhanced the antianxiety effect of thymoquinone in both unstressed and stressed mice. Therefore, the present study suggests an involvement of NO-cGMP and GABAergic pathways in the anxiolytic-like activity of thymoquinone.", 
    "133": "Earlier studies have demonstrated that the agonists of the mGlu(2/3) receptors produced anxiolytic actions after peripheral administration. However, the mechanism of their action is still not clear. Therefore the aim of the present study was to specify the role of the GABAergic and serotonergic system in the mechanism of the anxiolytic activity of group II mGlu receptor activators by using the stress induced hyperthermia test (SIH) in singly housed mice. We used an orthosteric mGlu(2/3) receptor agonist, LY379268, which induced anti-hyperthermic efficacy in the doses of 1-5mg/kg (73% of inhibition after a highest dose). The effect of the second ligand used, a mGlu(2) receptor positive modulator (PAM), LY487379, was observed in a dose range of 0.5-5mg/kg and reached 53% of the inhibition. The blockade of GABAergic system by GABA(A) receptor antagonist flumazenil (10mg/kg) or GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP55845 (10mg/kg), and the blockade of serotonergic system by 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635 (0.1 and 1mg/kg) or 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonist ritanserin (0.5mg/kg) had no influence on the anti-hyperthermic effect induced by effective dose of LY379268. However, the action of the effective dose of LY487379 was enhanced when co-administered with flumazenil, WAY100635 (0.1mg/kg) and ritanserin. Similar results were observed for the subeffective dose of LY379268 (0.5mg/kg). WAY100635 in a dose of 1mg/kg did not induce any enhancing effect on the activity of compounds. Therefore, it seems that the antagonism towards GABA(A) receptors, presynaptic 5-HT(1A) and postsynaptic 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors is responsible for the phenomenon.

    "134": "Metabolic adverse effects such as weight gain and dyslipidaemia represent a major concern in treatment with several antipsychotic drugs, including olanzapine. It remains unclear whether such metabolic side-effects fully depend on appetite-stimulating actions, or whether some dysmetabolic features induced by antipsychotics may arise through direct perturbation of metabolic pathways in relevant peripheral tissues. Recent clinical and preclinical studies indicate that dyslipidaemia could occur independently of weight gain. Using a rat model, we showed that subchronic treatment with olanzapine induces weight gain and increases adipose tissue mass in rats with free access to food. This effect was also observed for aripiprazole, considered metabolically neutral in the clinical setting. In pair-fed rats with limited food access, neither olanzapine nor aripiprazole induced weight gain. Interestingly, olanzapine, but not aripiprazole, induced weight-independent elevation of serum triglycerides, accompanied by up-regulation of several genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, both in liver and in adipose tissues. Our findings support the existence of tissue-specific, weight-independent direct effects of olanzapine on lipid metabolism.",

DISSCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results in the present study demonstrated that the combination of midazolam and a COX-2 inhibitor inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 production in human PBMCs even if each drug separately did not have any effect on it. The finding suggests that their combination is effective against excessive IL-6 production such as severe inflammatory response and that the effect of midazolam on IL-6 production is possibly elicited via 15dPGJ2.",

    "147": "The critical closing pressure (Pcrit) is the airway pressure at which the airway collapses and reflects the anatomical contribution to the genesis of obstructive sleep apnea. Pcrit is usually determined during non-rapid eye movement sleep at night, but has been determined under midazolam sedation during the day in the absence of sleep stage monitoring. Indeed, little is known about the effects of midazolam on sleep architecture. Moreover, deeper sedation with midazolam can decrease upper airway muscle activity and increase collapsibility compared with natural sleep. Pcrit under sedation has not been systematically compared with the usual method performed during natural sleep. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypothesis that Pcrit following low doses of midazolam during the day would be comparable to Pcrit measured during natural sleep in the same patient. Fifteen men (age 54 \u00b1 10 yr, body mass index 30 \u00b1 4 kg/m(2)) with obstructive sleep apnea underwent a baseline standard overnight polysomnogram (apnea-hypopnea index 38 \u00b1 22 events/h, range: 8-66 events/h), and Pcrit was determined during natural sleep and following midazolam. Sleep induction was obtained with low doses of midazolam (2.4 mg, range 2.0-4.4 mg), and sleep architecture was comparable to natural sleep. Natural sleep and induced sleep Pcrit were similar (-0.82 \u00b1 -3.44 and -0.97 \u00b1 3.21 cmH(2)O, P = 0.663) and closely associated (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.97, P < 0.001). Natural and midazolam-induced Pcrit correlated with obstructive sleep apnea severity, indicating that both Pcrit measures provided meaningful physiological information. Pcrit determined during the day with sleep induction is similar to natural overnight sleep and is a valid alternative approach in which to determine Pcrit.",

Low postpartum anxiety has been observed in many behavioral paradigms but the results of previous studies using the light-dark box have been inconsistent. We here reexamined the usefulness of the light-dark box to assess differences between postpartum and diestrous virgin female rats in their anxiety-related behavior. We found a significant effect of reproductive state, such that dams spent more time in the light chamber than did diestrous virgins. This difference required recent physical contact with pups because a four-hour separation from pups reduced dams' time spent in the light chamber by half, similar to what we previously found for litter-separated dams tested in an elevated plus maze. We then examined if dams' low-anxiety behavior in the light-dark box depends on high GABA(A) receptor activity by inhibiting the receptor at different binding sites using (+)-Bicuculline to target the GABA site, FG-7142 to target the benzodiazepine site, and pentylenetetrazol to target the picrotoxin site. Only pentylenetetrazol was consistently anxiogenic in dams, while having little effect in diestrous virgins. Thus, the light-dark box can be a useful paradigm to study differences between postpartum and diestrous virgin female rats in their anxiety-related behaviors, and this difference is influenced by dams' recent contact with pups and GABA(A) receptor neurotransmission particularly affected by activity at the picrotoxin site.",

Discontinuation of a number of cardiovascular drugs can increase risk of cardiovascular events above that of people not taking these drugs. These include \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists, aspirin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and heparin. Rebound hypertension occurs after abrupt cessation of many antihypertensive drugs. The possibility of discontinuation syndromes has usually been neglected until adverse clinical events force them to be noticed.

A case-control study was conducted in southern Taiwan from January 2009 to December 2009. The cases included car or van drivers who were involved in MVCs and required hospitalization. Demographic and trauma-related data were collected from questionnaires and hospital and ambulance records. Urine and/or blood samples were collected on admission. The controls consisted of drivers who were randomly recruited while driving on public roads. Study subjects were interviewed and asked to provide urine samples. All blood and urine samples were tested for alcohol and a number of other legal and illegal drugs. Only those subjects who provided urine and/or blood specimens were included in the study. During the study period, 254 case patients and 254 control drivers were enrolled. The analysis showed an odds ratio (OR) of 3.41 (95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.76-6.70; p\u2009<\u20090.001) for persons taking benzodiazepines, and an OR of 3.50 (95% CI, 1.81-6.85; p\u2009<\u20090.001) for those taking alcohol (blood alcohol concentrations (BAC)\u2009\u2265\u20090.8 g/l) with regard to hospitalizations due to MVCs. For persons taking combinations of benzodiazepines and alcohol, the OR increased to 5.12 (95% CI: 1.77-15.91, p\u2009<\u20090.001). This study concluded that drug use among motor vehicle drivers increases the risk of MVCs that require hospitalization.

    "175": "The elevated plus-maze (EPM) test is one of the most commonly used behavioral assays to evaluate anxiety-related behavior in rodents. It is an economic test (5\u2009min duration) without prior conditioning of the animals. The critical measure for anxiety is the time spent in the open arms of the maze. A confounding problem of the EPM is the so called one-trial tolerance (OTT), characterized by a marked decrease of open arm exploration in spite of treatment with anxiolytic acting benzodiazepines upon re-exposure to the EPM. This consistent finding is often raised as an evidence for the inappropriateness to re-test rodents in the EPM. However, a reliable re-test paradigm would broaden the usability and effectiveness of this test. Therefore, we tested how an extension of the inter-trial interval to 28\u2009days (instead of the usual 24\u2009h), and an additional change of the testing room would affect the open arm time and other behaviors on the EPM. In two experiments, drug-naive Wistar rats were exposed to the EPM on trial 1, and treated intraperitoneally with either vehicle or midazolam (0.25\u2009mg/kg) 30\u2009min before trial 2. Then, trial 2 (28\u2009days after trial 1) was carried out in either the same testing room (Experiment 1) or in another unfamiliar room (Experiment 2). Twenty-eight days after trial 1 the open arm time of the rats in the vehicle treated control rats of both experimental groups was comparable to that of the first trial, independent of the testing room. Most importantly, we found that the treatment with the benzodiazepine midazolam had a significantly anxiolytic-like (i.e., increase of open arm time) effect in trial 2 only when conducted in the previously unfamiliar testing room (Experiment 2). We suggest that in order to reliably re-test the EPM and to prevent confounding effects due to the OTT, an inter-trial interval of 28\u2009days and a change in testing rooms reinstates anxiolytic-like actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "176": "Dexmedetomidine undoubtedly is a useful sedative in the intensive care setting because it has a minimal effect on the respiratory system. Dexmedetomidine infusions lasting more than 24 hours have not been approved since the first approval was acquired in the US in 1999. However, in 2008, dexmedetomidine infusions for prolonged use were approved in Colombia and in the Dominican Republic, and the number of countries that have granted approval for prolonged use has been increasing every year. This review discusses the literature examining prolonged use of dexmedetomidine and confirms the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine when it is used for more than 24 hours. Dexmedetomidine was administered at varying doses (0.1-2.5 \u03bcg/kg/hour) and durations up to 30 days. Dexmedetomidine seems to be an alternative to benzodiazepines or propofol for achieving sedation in adults because the incidences of delirium and coma associated with dexmedetomidine are lower than the corresponding incidences associated with benzodiazepines and propofol, although dexmedetomidine administration can cause mild adverse effects such as bradycardia. Controlled comparative studies on the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine and other sedatives in pediatric patients have not been reported. However, dexmedetomidine seems to be effective in managing extubation, reducing the use of conventional sedatives, and as an alternative for inducing sedation in patients for whom traditional sedatives induce inadequate sedation. Prolonged dexmedetomidine infusion has not been reported to have any serious adverse effects. Dexmedetomidine appears to be an alternative long-term sedative, but further studies are needed to establish its efficacy and safety.",

Small molecule inhibitors of CHK proteins are under clinical evaluation in combination with chemotherapeutic agents known to induce DNA damage. We examined whether CHK inhibitors could be effective as single agents in malignant cells with inherent DNA damage because of deregulated expression of the oncogene c-Myc. E\u03bc-myc lymphoma cells showed a dramatic increase in the extent of DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) signalling within 1 h of treatment with CHK1 inhibitors followed by caspase-dependent apoptosis and cell death. In p53 wild-type/ARF null E\u03bc-myc lymphoma cells, apoptotic cell death was preceded by accumulation of DNA damage and the amount of DNA damage correlated with the extent of cell death. This effect was not observed in normal B cells indicating that DNA damage accumulation following CHK inhibition was specific to E\u03bc-myc lymphoma cells that exhibit inherent DNA damage because of MYC-induced replication stress. Similar results were obtained with another structurally distinct CHK-inhibitor. E\u03bc-myc p53 null lymphoma cells were more sensitive to a dual CHK1/CHK2 inhibitor than to a CHK1-specific inhibitor. In all cases, the level of DNA damage following treatment was the most consistent indicator of drug sensitivity. Our results suggest that CHK inhibitors would be beneficial therapeutic agents in MYC-driven cancers. We propose that inhibitors of CHK can act in a synthetically lethal manner in cancers with replication stress as a result of these cancers being reliant on CHK proteins for an effective DDR and cell survival.",

    "199": "Weight gain and metabolic abnormalities are serious side effects associated with the use of several second generation antipsychotics (SGA). The adipose tissue has been considered a direct SGA target involved in the development of these adverse effects. Recent studies, mainly using murine cells, have suggested that SGA increase both adipogenesis of preadipocytes and lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. However, to date there has been little research comparing the effects of antipsychotics with different propensities to induce weight gain on human in vitro models of white adipose tissue neoformation and metabolism. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of antipsychotics either strongly associated with weight gain, such as the SGA clozapine and olanzapine, or not, such as the SGA ziprasidone and the classical antipsychotic haloperidol, on proliferation and adipocyte differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and lipogenesis in human mature adipocytes. Whereas ziprasidone induced elevated levels of cell death during adipogenesis and could not be investigated further, we observed that clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol had slight stimulatory effects on the transcriptional program of ADSCs adipogenesis. However, the observed changes in adipocyte-specific genes were not accompanied by a significant increase in triglyceride accumulation within differentiated adipocytes. Our data also showed that these three antipsychotics displayed inhibitory effects on the proliferation rates of undifferentiated ADSCs. Regarding mature adipocyte metabolism, we observed that olanzapine slightly inhibited insulin-stimulated lipogenesis at the highest concentration used, and haloperidol exerted the strongest inhibitory effects on both basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that a direct and potent effect of clozapine and olanzapine on adipose tissue biology is not an important mechanism by which these SGA induce metabolic disturbances in humans. On the other hand, the haloperidol-mediated downregulation of the lipogenic capacity of human adipose tissue may be a possible mechanism contributing to its lower propensity to induce serious metabolic side effects.", 
    "200": "Several in vivo and in vitro studies have confirmed that flavonols are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to their corresponding hydroxyphenylacetic acids. In this article, a comparison of the anxiolytic activity of the flavonols kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin in the elevated plus maze after oral (po) and intraperitoneal (ip) administration to mice in a dose range of 0.1 to 2.0 mg/kg is presented. In addition, their corresponding metabolites p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (p-HPAA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were tested after intraperitoneal administration. Anxiolytic activity was detected for kaempferol and quercetin only after oral administration. No anxiolytic effects were observed when kaempferol and quercetin were given via the intraperitoneal administration route. The corresponding hydroxyphenylacetic metabolites p-HPAA and DOPAC showed anxiolytic effects after intraperitoneal application. In order to further test the hypothesis that flavonoids are possible prodrugs which require activation by intestinal bacteria, gut sterilization was performed using pretreatment with the antibiotic enrofloxacin (7.5 mg/day, po, for 4 days). After antibiotic treatment, the anxiolytic effect of kaempferol and quercetin disappeared, whereas it was still present for the positive control diazepam. Our results support the hypothesis that flavonoids act as prodrugs which are transformed into their active hydroxyphenylacetic acid metabolites by intestinal microflora.",

It has poor bioavailability due to hepatic first-pass metabolism and low permeability into the brain due to efflux by P-glycoproteins. The present investigation aimed to prepare a nanoparticulate drug delivery system of OZ using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) for direct nose-to-brain delivery to provide brain targeting and sustained release. PLGA nanoparticles (NP) were prepared by the nanoprecipitation technique and characterized by entrapment efficiency, particle size, zeta potential, modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (MTDSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies. The NP were evaluated for in vitro release, ex vivo diffusion, toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies. The NP were 91.2\u00b15.2 nm in diameter and had entrapment efficiency 68.91\u00b12.31%. MTDSC studies indicated broadening of the drug peak and a shift in the polymer peak, possibly due to physical interaction or H-bonding between the carbonyl groups of PLGA and the NH groups of OZ, and also due to the plasticization effect of OZ on PLGA. XRD studies indicated a decrease in the crystallinity of OZ or amorphization. In vitro drug release showed a biphasic pattern with initial burst release and, later, sustained release (43.26\u00b10.156% after 120 h), following the Fickian diffusion-based release mechanism. Ex vivo diffusion through sheep nasal mucosa showed 13.21\u00b11.59% of drug diffusion in 210 min from NP. Histopathological study of sheep nasal mucosa showed no significant adverse effect of OZ-loaded NP. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies showed 6.35 and 10.86 times higher uptake of intranasally delivered NP than OZ solution delivered through intravenous (IV) and intranasal (IN) route, respectively. These results proved that OZ could be transported directly to the brain after IN delivery of PLGA NP, enhanced drug concentration in the brain and would therefore be effective in improving the treatment of central nervous system disorders.", 
    "206": "Animal models can face unique challenges in mirroring what occurs in humans. This is the case for antipsychotics in rodents, where these drugs are metabolized much more rapidly. One strategy to address this issue has been the use of osmotic minipumps to ensure continuous antipsychotic exposure over prolonged intervals, which is routinely the case when these same drugs are administered to humans. More recently, it has been identified that with olanzapine this approach may be compromised by oxidative degradation, a process that can be observed within days. Further, in vivo evidence has reported progressive decreases in plasma levels over a 1-month interval. To address this issue in vitro, osmotic minipumps (n=4), with olanzapine at a concentration resulting in a dose of 7.5mg/kg/day in vivo, were placed in saline-filled Falcon tubes and immersed in a water bath. Olanzapine concentrations were assessed in the minipumps as well as the surrounding water bath at baseline, 1h, and days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Minipump results indicated a monophasic exponential decay and a half-life of 14.8 days (95% CI=13.1-17.1 days). Results from the water bath demonstrated a linear increase in olanzapine up to and including day 21, followed thereafter by a decrease to day 28. It is concluded that administration of olanzapine via osmotic minipump is viable in animal models to mirror what occurs in humans, although the interval should be confined to 2 weeks. As well, strategies in dissolving olanzapine to diminish oxidation are discussed.",

    "208": "In PANC-1 cells treated with Z-360, anti-gastrin IgG or kinase inhibitors, the gene expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and the protein levels of Akt and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) in cellular extracts were measured by ELISA.", 
    "209": "Gemcitabine-induced expression of VEGF and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) were suppressed by the treatment with an anti-gastrin antibody. In addition, VEGF and HIF-1 alpha gene expression was inhibited by treatment with an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which is involved in the downstream signaling pathway of the CCK-2/gastrin receptor, and was also suppressed by treatment with Z-360. Moreover, although Akt phosphorylation was increased by treatment with gemcitabine, this elevation was partially, but significantly, inhibited by an exposure of Z-360.", 
    "210": "Gemcitabine might induce gene expression of VEGF via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the downstream of the CCK-2/gastrin receptor. The suppression of the CCK-2/gastrin signaling pathway by treatment with Z-360 could be a useful approach for potentiating prolonged survival of pancreatic cancer patients receiving gemcitabine therapy.", 
    "211": "A rapid LC-MS/MS method for confirmatory testing of five major categories of drugs of abuse (amphetamine-type substances, opiates, cocaine, cannabis metabolites and benzodiazepines) in urine has been developed. All drugs of abuse mandated by the Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 4308:2008 are quantified in a single chromatographic run. Urine samples are diluted with a mixture of isotope labelled internal standards. An on-line trap-and-flush approach, followed by LC-ESI-MS/MS has been successfully used to process samples in a functioning drugs of abuse laboratory. Following injection of diluted urine samples, compounds retained on the trap cartridge are flushed onto a reverse-phase C18 HPLC column (5-\u03bcm particle size) with embedded hydrophylic functionality. A total chromatographic run-time of 15 min is required for adequate resolution. Automated quantitation software algorithms have been developed in-house using XML scripting to partially automate the identification of positive samples, taking into account ion ratio (IR) and retention times (Rt). The sensitivity of the assay was found to be adequate for the quantitation of drugs in urine at and below the confirmation cut-off concentrations prescribed by AS/NZS 4308:2008.", 
    "212": "In the developing brain, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) capable of myelinating axons. Recently, OPCs have been identified as an abundant and widespread population in the adult as well as in the developing animal. Current research indicates that these OPCs in the adult brain can proliferate and differentiate into myelinating OLs, albeit with different potentialities from those in developing animals. Multiple lines of evidence, from neuroimaging, postmortem, and genetic association studies, have implicated OL and myelin dysfunction in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. If altered OL function is involved in pathogenesis, OPCs may thus respond to antipsychotic drugs during the recovery process. In the present study, we used primary OPC cultures from optic nerve of newborn Wistar rat pups to investigate the direct effects of haloperidol (HPD; a typical antipsychotic) and olanzapine (OLZ; an atypical antipsychotic) on the proliferation and differentiation of OPCs. Our results showed that 1) OLZ treatment significantly increased the number of viable OPCs when compared to HPD treatment at relatively high concentrations, 2) OLZ treatment suppressed the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), and to a greater extent than HPD treatment, and 3) these pharmacological effects may be mediated via the ERK signaling pathway. Our findings suggest a glial mechanism for the antipsychotic action of OLZ, and a role for oligodendrocyte-lineage cells in the pathogenesis and treatment of schizophrenia.", 
    "213": "A general and highly efficient protocol for the synthesis of dibenzodiazepines and their structural analogues is reported. In the presence of catalytic quantities of palladium, readily accessible precursors are cross-coupled with ammonia and then spontaneously undergo an intramolecular condensation to form the corresponding dibenzodiazepines in one step. This new strategy is applicable to the construction of a wide variety of dibenzooxazepines and other structurally related heterocycles.", 
    "214": "To measure the changes in subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat and other metabolic parameters in patients with psychotic disorders, who were newly started on olanzapine treatment and in drug-free controls. The correlation between changes in visceral fat and other metabolic parameters were also studied.", 
    "215": "Using a longitudinal open-label design, the 2 studied groups included patients with psychoses (n = 23) [diagnosed as per the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases criteria] and drug-free controls (n = 11). Fasting sugar, lipid profile and glycosylated haemoglobin levels were collected at baseline and follow-up. Computed tomographic scans were used to determine changes in the various abdominal fat parameters.", 
    "216": "The patients were significantly younger than the controls, and the former had higher mean subcutaneous fat at baseline. There were statistically significant increases in the subcutaneous fat, intraabdominal fat, weight, waist circumference, hip circumference and body mass index in patients but not in controls. The mean dose of olanzapine (mg/day) correlated significantly with change of intraabdominal fat at follow-up. The change in intra-abdominal fat did not correlate significantly with any of the metabolic parameters studied.", 
    "217": "Olanzapine produced significant increase in weight and fat parameters. This increase correlated with the dose of olanzapine.", 
    "218": "The advent of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with the sensitivity it confers, permits the analysis of both phase I and II drug metabolites that in the past would have been difficult to target using other techniques. These metabolites may have relevance to current analytical toxicology employing LC-MS/MS, and lorazepam was chosen as a model drug for investigation, as only the parent compound has been targeted for screening purposes. Following lorazepam administration (2 mg, p.o.) to 6 volunteers, metabolites were identified in urine by electrospray ionization LC-MS/MS, aided by the use of deuterated analogues generated by microsomal incubation for use as internal chromatographic and mass spectrometric markers. Metabolites present were lorazepam glucuronide, a quinazolinone, a quinazoline carboxylic acid, and two hydroxylorazepam isomers, one of which is novel, having the hydroxyl group located on the fused chlorobenzene ring. The quinazolinone, and particularly the quinazoline carboxylic acid metabolite, provided longer detection windows than lorazepam in urine extracts not subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis, a finding that is highly relevant to toxicology laboratories that omit hydrolysis in order to rapidly reduce the time spent on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. With hydrolysis, the longest windows of detection were achieved by monitoring lorazepam, supporting the targeting of the aglycone with free drug for those incorporating hydrolysis in their analytical toxicology procedures.", 
    "219": "To investigate the plasma-concentration profile of lorazepam when administered by the intranasal and buccal routes to determine their utility for the treatment of prolonged seizures.", 
    "220": "On two occasions separated by at least 7 days washout, 12 healthy adult male volunteers received 2 mg of lorazepam via the intranasal or buccal route. Blood samples were collected at time periods from 0 to 48 h, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined.", 
    "221": "Lorazepam was well absorbed from both administration routes; however, there was a more pronounced lag phase with the buccal route and absorption was more rapid from the intranasal route.", 
    "222": "Intranasal lorazepam has more favourable pharmacokinetics than buccal lorazepam when considering the need for the rapid blood concentrations required for seizure termination. Further clinical evaluation of this route is required.", 
    "223": "In the reaction of 7-chloro-1,5-benzodiazepine-2,4-dione with N,N-dimethyl-formamide/dimethyl-acetal, the diazepine seven-membered ring undergoes a contraction to form the five-membered ring. The reaction yields two isomers the title compound, C(13)H(14)ClN(3)O(2); the major component has the chlorine-atom substituent in the 5-position of the benzimidazolone ring and the minor component has the chlorine atom in the 6-position. The two isomers form a disordered co-crystal, the chloro-methyl-benzimidazolone portion of both components are disordered with respect to each other in a 4:1 ratio [the refined ratio is 0.816\u2005(5):0.184\u2005(5)]; the dimethyl-amino-cryloyl substitutent is ordered. The double bond of the dimethyl-amino-acryloyl substituent has an E configuration."
