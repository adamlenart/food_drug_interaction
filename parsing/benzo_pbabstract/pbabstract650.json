    "0": "It was shown in experiments on rats that the reaction of self-stimulation (SS) decreased the enhanced level of 11-hydrohycorticosteroids (11-HCS) in the blood after electrical pain stimulation(EPS) of the feet. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) decreased the levels of 11-HCS and beta-lipoproteids and increased the level of phospholipids after self-stimulation and pain stimulation. Diazepam and preliminary electrical pain stimulation induced activation of self-stimulation. It is concluded that diazepam and the activation of the positive reinforcing system exert similar effects on 11-HCS excretion and lipid levels after pain stimulation.", 
    "1": "Food and water intake were measured in non-deprived pigeons over a 4h period during daytime. Under control conditions, the ratio of food to water intake was approximately 1:1, and both intakes were a simple linear function of time. Chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, i.m.) doubled the mean amount of food intake, whilst leaving water intake unchanged. This is a first indication that chlordiazepoxide can selectively stimulate appetite for food in an avian species. Some birds showed sedation following a first acute injection; its duration was shortened after repeated injections, and the hyperphagic response to the drug was revealed.", 
    "2": "In male mice of the C57 strain, chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) reduced the latency to begin eating and prolonged the total time devoted to eating in a food-preference test. The increase in feeding duration arose from an increase in the mean duration of individual eating episodes and not from a change in the number of episodes that were initiated. In contrast, in male mice of the A2G strain CDP (at the same dose levels) did not reduce the latency to begin eating and only prolonged the total time devoted to eating at a single dose level (5.0 mg/kg). The two strains differed in their choice between novel and familiar foods that were concurrently available in the test. The A2G mice virtually ignored the palatable novel foods and devoted all their feeding to the familiar food. The C57 strain, however, spent more time eating the novel foods than the familiar food. CDP at all doses increased the duration of feeding devoted to familiar food in the C57 animals, but did not increase feeding duration in the A2G mice. However, CDP (10.0 mg/kg) increased the time spent eating novel foods in both strains to the same degree. Possible mechanisms underlying the effect of CDP on food-preference behaviour in mice and accounting for the strain difference in response to CDP are considered.", 
    "3": "The effects of oral oxprenolol (480 mg) and lorazepam (2 mg) on skin conductance, reaction time, critical flicker frequency and self-rating visual analogue scales for anxiety, sedation and concentration were investigated in 6 healthy male volunteers. Oxprenolol exerted a central action similar to lorazepam as shown by a significant lowering of skin conductance and decrease in the number of spontaneous fluctuations during stress, impaired critical flicker frequency and decrease in alertness with reduced concentration.", 
    "4": "To further evaluate the effects of flurazepam on EEG during sleep, following 7 nights of placebo baseline, flurazepam (30 mg) was administered to 6 young adult poor sleepers for 10 additional nights while 6 other young adult poor sleepers continued to receive placebo capsules in a double-blind paradigm. Three placebo follow-up nights were recorded 2--3 weeks post-treatment. Twelve good sleepers received only placebo capsules for the first 7 nights. Delta waves, 0.5--2 c/sec, and sleep spindles were counted on-line by a phasic detector. Delta activity was also analyzed off-line by PDP-12 computer for only the first 4 h of sleep and involved a comparison over stages of sleep. Click-evoked K-complexes during NREM sleep were analyzed for 6 good sleepers and 11 poor sleepers. Repeated use of flurazepam caused a gradual decrease in delta amplitude and count, and a gradual increase in sleep spindle rate. The decrease in delta amplitude was seen in all sleep stages, but the decrease was significant only during SWS and stage 2. The decrease in delta amplitude was significant by the 3rd drug night, but the rate of amplitude decrease tended to slow with continued treatment. The decrease in delta count was less pronounced and more gradual over drug nights than the rate of decrease in amplitude. Flurazepam also significantly reduced evoked K-complex amplitude but did not affect latency. Sleep spindle rate was significantly increased by drug night 5. Results of this study indicate that the reduction of SWS with flurazepam during the initial drug nights is due primarily to the decrease in delta amplitude, but, with continued use, the decrease in delta count also contributes to the decrease in stage 4 sleep.", 
    "5": "Flunitrazepam was used in general and local anesthesia. Little effect was noted on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. In our patients there was an impressive period of amnesia and often we observed a central anticholinergic syndrome, which could be reversed by the use of physostigmine salicylate (0.04/kg body weight).", 
    "6": "Lorazepam, a dichloro-3-hydroxy-1,4-benzodiazepine, has been shown to be a potent anticonvulsant in animal models of epilsepsy and has minimal depressant effects on respiration and circulation in humans. The effects of this compound were studied in status epilepticus. Twenty-five patients were given intravenous lorazepam during status epilepticus of varying cause. Four or 8 mg of the drug controlled status in 22 of the 25 patients. Although single seizures recurred in 5 of the 22 patients, none experienced recurrence of status during a prolonged follow-up period. Transient respiratory arrest occurred in 1 patient, but no other significant complications were observed. Studies of plasma drug levels suggest that most patients attain good seizure control at concentrations between 30 and 100 ng per milliliter. Clinical observations indicate that repetitive injections are not required for continuing control of seizures in patients whose seizures are initially controlled. Lorazepam appears to be an effective and safe drug for treatment of status epilepticus, with a duration of control longer than that achieved with diazepam.", 
    "7": "A simple technique employing i.v. Ro5-4200 and a local anaesthetic to obtain general anaesthesia prior to bronchoscopy, particularly after chest operations, is described. The optimal sedation offered by Ro5-4200 enables this trying examination to be performed without risk and with the best possible degree of comfort for the patient and the operator.", 
    "8": "In an operant procedure of lever pressing on a FR 10 schedule of food reinforcement, male hooded rats were trained to respond with a lever on one side of a food cup following a drug injection, and to respond with a lever on the alternate side following a 1 ml/kg saline injection. All of 14 subjects learned to discriminate reliably between the effects of 20 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and saline. Seven of eight rats learned to discriminate between the effects of bemegride (5 mg/kg) and saline. None of 14 rats learned to discriminate between 5mg/kg PTZ and saline. The bemegride discriminative stimulus generalized to PTZ (20mg/kg) and was antagonized by chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg). Chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, flurazepam, clobazam, and meprobamate were all effective antagonist of PTZ in a dose-dependent manner. Bemegride and cocaine generalized to the PTZ discriminative stimulus in a dose-dependent manner, but d-amphetamine, methylphenidate, and nicotine did not. Since bemegride and PTZ are convulsants at higher doses, the discriminative stimulus properties of these drugs might be based on a subtle convulsive brain state. The anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines and meprobamate suggest that the discriminative stimulus produced by these convulsants is related to an \"anxiety-inducing\" action.", 
    "9": "Chronic toxicity of the benzodiazepine series tranquilizer phenazepam (5 and 50 mg/kg) administered per os for 1.3 and 6 months was studied in experiments on white rats, guinea pigs and dogs. It has been shown during varying time of observation that the drug neither decreases weight gain in the animals nor adversly acts on the blood or produces local irritating action. Histopathological changes in some internal organs proved irreversible. Administered at varying periods of pregnancy, phenazepam at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg exerted no embryotoxic or teratogenic action.", 
    "10": "The inborn seizure response of Papio papio to intermittent light stimulation has been reviewed as a model of human epilepsy. The electrographic and clinical features have been described and useful methodology has been outlined. A diurnal cyclicity in seizure responsiveness has been described with greatest seizure severity at 8 AM in parallel with a rise in urinary output of cortisol. Hormonal influences on the seizure response have been described for ethinyl estradiol, thyroxin, and triiodothyronine. Evidence regarding neurotransmitter involvement has been reviewed. Data regarding use of the animal for anticonvulsant testing in single and chronic doses has been discussed. Particular advantages of the model for study of age-related drug effects and the assessment of the effects of chronically administered anticonvulsant agents on learning and memory have been described.", 
    "11": "With careful differential diagnosis and judicious treatment, you may be able to reverse certain aspects of dementia in the elderly. Drug toxicity, depression, metabolic and endocrine disorders, and other systemic problems are all potentially treatable causes of mental deterioration. Even when the cause cannot be identified, you can still treat the patient's symptoms. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, and antianxiety agents, plus supportive measures, often effect marked improvement.", 
    "12": "Analysis of 2006 prescriptions given to 641 unselected patients by 360 doctors in the French- and Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland provides a wealth of information on prescription trends and the cost of medicine. The patients ordinarily received medication belonging to several therapeutic groups, usually 2 or 3 but up to 9 different groups. Each prescription averaged 2.08 drugs with a mean cost of 18.90 Swiss francs. The price varied considerably according to the group of drugs. Those related to the cardiovascular system were the most expensive closely followed by antibiotics, while the ophthalmological prescriptions were the least expensive. Hydergine is the most-sold drug in Switzerland, followed by Bactrim; however, if the various benzodiazepines were grouped together their sale would exceed the others. There are 62 different drugs for rheumatic conditions and 47 penicillins in Switzerland. The abundance of drugs and the prescription of medication with dubious action contribute to the inflationary cost of illness. For any given drug there is a striking parallelism between the number of pages publicizing it in 4 medical journals and total sales. This clearly demonstrates the influence of advertising on prescription trends. Doctors should be aware of this fact and rely on more objective sources of their information about drugs.", 
    "13": "A \"recptor unit\" for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which includes brainlike receptor binding sites for tritium-labeled GABA and benzodiazepines (diazepam, clonazepam, and flunitrazepam) and a thermostable endogenous protein (GABA modulin) that inhibits both GABA and benzodiazepine binding, has been demonstrated in membranes prepared from NB2a neuroblastoma and C6 glioma clonal cell lines. In these cells, as in brain, diazepam (1 micromolar) prevents the effect of GABA modulin, and in turn GABA (0.oma and, to a lesser extent, the glioma cells represent a suitable model to study the interactions and the sequence of membrane and intracellular events triggered by the stimulation of benzodiazepine and GABA receptors.", 
    "14": "Rats were trained to discriminate drug from no-drug conditions in a two-lever operant task. Moderately high dosages were used initially. Whenever the discrimination was learned, training was continued with progressively reduced dosages. Eventually the rats discriminated extremely low doses of phenobarbital, chlordiazepoxide, cyclazocine, and fentanyl.", 
    "15": "Mouse spinal neurons grown in tissue culture were used to study the membrane effects of the benzodiazepine flurazepam and the naturally occurring purine nucleoside inosine, which competes for benzodiazepine receptor sites in the central nervous system. Application of inosine elicited two types of transmitter-like membrane effects: a rapidly desensitizing excitatory response and a nondesensitizing inhibitory response. Flurazepam produced a similar excitatory response which showed cross-desensitization with the purine excitation. Flurazepam also blocked the inhibitory inosine response. The results provide electrophysiological evidence that an endogenous purine can activate two different conductances on spinal neurons and that flurazepam can activate one of the conductances and antagonize the other.", 
    "16": "The main purpose of this study was to compare sensitivity of several self-rating scales to drug effects in anxious and depressed patients. Twenty-two distressed nonpsychotic outpatients completed a double-blind crossover trial of chlordiazepoxide and placebo. All self-rating scales of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and feelings of inadequacy discriminated significantly between chlordiazepoxide and placebo. The decrease in self-rated depression was about equal to the decrease in self-rated anxiety. Subscales describing well-being were more sensitive to drug effects than subscales describing symptoms. A questionnaire (The Symptom Questionnaire) and one of the self-rating scales (Symptom Rating Test) were more sensitive than global self-rating scales, global observer-rating scales, and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Some of the self-rating scales discriminated significantly between drug and placebo even when the sample size was reduced to two subsamples of eight patients each. High and significant positive correlations between two scales did not indicate equal sensitivity in discriminating between drug and placebo.", 
    "17": "Spontaneous locomotor activity has been studied in mice treated with chlordiazepoxide, atropine, and scopolamine, given alone or in combination. Chlordiazepoxide alone increased activity for a short time, while the two anticholinergic drugs produced longer lasting stimulatory effects. Locomotor stimulation was stronger when chlordiazepoxide and anticholinergics were given in combination.", 
    "18": "The effects on active social interaction of acute and chronic dosage with diazepam (1 mg/kg), desmethyldiazepam (2 mg/kg), and chlor-desmethyl-diazepam (0.125 mg/kg) were studied in pairs of mice. The mice were tested under either high or low levels of illumination. In all cases acute drug treatment significantly reduced social interaction, but this was not seen with chronic treatment (9 days). Two of the drugs, diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, showed an anxiolytic action, i.e., these drugs resulted in significantly less variation in social interaction with the change in light levels, compared with vehicle-injected controls.", 
    "19": "A patient who developed hyperpyrexia and heat stroke after taking overdoses of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, benzodiazepines and a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent is described. The possible mechanisms involved in drug-induced hyperpyrexia are briefly discussed.", 
    "20": "This study describes a population of deceased persons in which death was generally caused by ingestion of numerous drugs, of which diazepam was only one agent. This drug occurred with high frequency relative to the total case load at each site, but its toxicological importance was often of a low order, and its role in the fatal cases was judged as minimal.", 
    "21": "The extent of intersubject variation in diazepam free fraction was measured in fasting plasma of 74 unrelated subjects. Free fraction differences between subjects were significant and ranged from 0.97% to 1.99%. Diazepam free fraction in 29 males was normally distributed about a mean of 1.25% (range, 1.05% to 1.47%), but the distribution in females was skewed to higher free fractions and 40% had values above the highest in males. Albumin concentration (r = -0.27, p less than 0.002) and age (r = 0.44, p less than 0.001) only accounted for a small part of the variation. Within-pair variances were not greater in 11 dizygotic than in 18 monozygotic twin pairs, indicating a greater contribution of environmental than of genetic factors to diazepam binding. The prehemodialysis free fractions of diazepam in 9 uremic patients ranged from 3.44% to 6.69%, and decreased (p less than 0.005) in 7 after 6 hr of hemodialysis. In 10 subjects determination of intrasubject variation in diazepam free fraction between 14-hr fasting and 2-hr postprandial plasma samples indicated that because subjects differ in their pattern of change in free fraction (p less than 0.001), the overall decrease in mean free fraction did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.10). The mean relative percent change in free fraction within subjects after feeding was 15.2%.", 
    "22": "Clonazepam (Antelepsin) was tested on 179 patients in 8 institutions during a period of 180 days. 169 patients had been unsuccessfully treated with the usual standard medication and were additionally given Antelepsin. Typical absences and attacks of the West and Lennox syndromes yielded best to treatment with the drug, with favorable effects also being produced in cases of partial or focal epilepsy. The most important side-effect was tiredness, other collateral effects being balance disorders, sensations of dizziness, and musuclar weakness. The frequency of side-effects decreased in the course of therapy. In the electroencephalogram there was observed a significant increase in beta waves and a significant decrease in 3 Hz spike and wave complexes.", 
    "23": "Chemical analyses provide a useful and necessary mean of information on progress of drug addicts in desintoxication program. Meanwhile, a systematic planning of analytical controls should be settled. Results observed on two groups of addicts in Switzerland are presented.", 
    "24": "Forty-six outpatients with anxiety-tension states took part in a study on the effects of anxiolytic drugs. At the first interview ratings were performed and the patients answered a questionnaire as to their experience of the consultation (n = 42). Based on follow-up examinations after 2, 4 and 8 weeks, three groups were formed: completers, who did not experience side-effects to be of such intensity that they changed the recommended dose (n = 15); deviators, who due to side-effects changed the recommended dose temporarily or permanently (n = 20); and attritors (n = 7). One to two years after the end of the drug study a personality inventory was sent out by post. It was returned by 35 patients. 1) Completers, deviators and attritors were similar with regard to age, education and social class. 2) They were also similar with regard to initial distress level. 3) Completers had the highest scores on scales measuring the personality traits defence of status and guilt-feelings and on the factor inex neurotic self-assertiveness, while attritors had the lowest scores. 4) Completers, deviators and attritors were similar with regard to experience of the first consultation. 5) Patients with a more favourable experience of the first consultation reported taking lower doses of the drugs.", 
    "25": "Intravenously administered theophylline (50--100 mg/kg) antagonized the depressant actions of adenosine and flurazepam on rat cerebral cortical neurons. When assessed in conjunction with recent reports that theophylline competes with diazepam for binding sites in brain tissue, this finding suggests that one action of the benzodiazepines may be exerted at a purinergic receptor associated with central neurons.", 
    "26": "Serum concentrations of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam were measured in six adult patients following administration of 10 mg diazepam in solution by the rectal, intravenous, and intramuscular routes. Maximum serum concentrations of 121--200 ng/ml were recorded from 10 to 20 min. after the rectal instillation, whereas following intramuscular injection the levels rose slowly and irregularly, reaching a maximum (62--186 ng/ml) in 1 to 24 hours. The bioavailability of diazepam given by rectal instillation was found to be 50 +/- 17 per cent (mean +/- S. D.) as compared with the intravenous administration. The possible reasons for the low bioavailability are discussed. It is concluded that administration by rectal tube provides a useful alternative to the tablets (and intramuscular injections) when a rapid onset of effect of the drug is wanted, and when intravenous administration is not applicable or practical.", 
    "27": "Acute interictal psychotic attacks during withdrawal of medication are described in two patients with temporal lobe epilepsy submitted to depth EEG study with a view to surgical treatment. The patients were on chronic treatment with clonazepam associated in one with phenobarbitone and in the other with phenobarbitone plus carbamazepine. Our observations suggest that the acute withdrawal of clonazepam, the plasma levels of which were monitored may play a part in producing psychotic attacks characterised by dysphoric manifestations, irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, and hallucinations. These symptoms could be interpreted as a withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "28": "The management of the pregnant epileptic requires close cooperation between the neurologist and obstetrician. To prevent complications, knowledge is required about the natural history of epilepsy during pregnancy, the possible teratogenic effects of antiepileptic drugs, and changes in their absorption, biotransformation, and excretion. Close plasma antiepileptic drug monitoring is required because of the change in the handling of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. The treatment of status epilepticus with intravenous phenytoin is effective. Drug interactions which may lead to toxic plasma levels of some drugs and subtherapeutic plasma levels of others should be anticipated. The risk of problems resulting from antiepileptic drug therapy during pregnancy appears to be minor, provided that proper medical supervision is available. Newer antiepileptic drugs should not be administered to the pregnant epileptic until their safety in pregnancy is fully established.", 
    "29": "The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was administered to 15 subjects before initiation of the experiment. Three subgroups of five subjects were defined by computing the unweighted sum of the state and trait anxiety scores. A 40-mg dose of clobazam, a 1.5-benzodiazepine, was administered to each subject and repeated with two additional dosage forms following a 2-week washout period. Blood samples were withdrawn, and blood levels were determined by fluorometric analysis. Additionally, pupillary measures of critical flicker fusion, constriction, and dilation in response to a cognitive task were obtained at 0, 2, 4, and 6 hr. A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that blood levels were, as expected, statistically different over time and dosage form. The pupillary constriction mirrored the blood levels in statistical patterns. The pupillary measure of cognition related to the anxiety state after the performance effects of the cognitive task were statistically removed. The results suggest that clobazam has less immediate human effect than does diazepam.", 
    "30": "Thirty-four inpatients in a mild phase of alcohol withdrawal, exhibiting anxious and depressive symptoms, were administered an MMPI before and immediately after a 4-week drug treatment period. A double-blind design was used; 17 patients were treated with chlordiazepoxide and 17, with thioridazine. The pretreatment MMPI profile was typical of alcoholic patients; namely, peaks on scales 4 and 2. After the fourth week, the MMPI indicated that thioridazine was significantly more effective than chlordizaepoxide. Decreases in 7 of the 10 clinical scales averaged 7.29 T-score points, whereas only scale 6 was significantly decreased for the patients treated with chlordiazepoxide.", 
    "31": "When disease impairs clearance of drugs, multiple-dose therapy may result in cumulation. The disposition of chlordiazepoxide (CDX), 50 mg infused intravenously over 10 min, was studied in 14 normal subjects and in 11 patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis. In the normal subjects, mean (+/- SE) kinetic parameters were: t 1/2 beta, 10.0 (+/- 0.9) hr; Vd, 0.38 (+/- 0.04) l/kg; clearance, 0.54 (+/- 0.13) ml/min/kg. Clearance of total drug correlated inversely with serum albumin concentration in normal subjects (r = -0.63). Values in cirrhotic patients were: t 1/2 beta, 34.9 (+/- 8.7) hr; Vd, 0.34 (+/- 0.024) 1/kg; and clearance, 0.185 (+/- 0.34) ml/min/kg. Desmethylchlordiazepoxide (DMCDX), the major metabolite of CDX, appeared in blood of cirrhotic patients less rapidly than in normal subjects. Severity of liver disease did not indicate the impairment of CDX clearance. In 5 of the same cirrhotic patients, mean t 1/2 beta for oxazepam (7.1 +/- 1.0 hr) was 27% longer than in control subjects (5.6 +/- 0.7 hr); the difference is not significant. On kinetic grounds oxazepam may be preferable to chlordiazepoxide in cirrhotic patients since its elimination kinetics are not greatly altered in cirrhosis.", 
    "32": "A simple and specific radioimmunoassay (RIA) was developed for the determination of oxazepam and other 1,4-benzodiazepines in human blood serum and urine (e.g., diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, chlorazepate). For serum a 1:10 dilution, for urine a 1:100 dilution is recommended. Blood and hemolyzed samples need prior extraction by Amberlite XAD-2. The antisera were raised by immunizing \"White New Zealand\"-rabbits with an oxazepam-3-hemisuccinate bovine serum albumin conjugate. Using 0.1 ml serum dilution the sensitivity is 0.01 mg/l per tube. Especially higher concentrations show a tendency toward underestimation. Being not limited to a single 1,4-benzodiazepine derivative, the specificity of the antisera is also suitable for a screening analysis. Compared to thin-layer chromatographic analysis of urine this assay shows improved sensitivity (0.05--0.1 mg/l in 0.1 ml of a 1:100 dilution = 1 microliter of urine). For forensic investigations, an analysis in the sequence of urine-RIA, blood/serum-RIA, blood/serum-\"electron-capture\"-gas-liquid chromatography (ECD-GLC) seems to be a helpful approach. Blood levels of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam determined by RIA and GLC after extraction are in satisfactory agreement.", 
    "33": "Clobazam is a benzodiazepine with special molecular structure (its nitrogen radicals are in positions 1 and 5, rather than 1 and 4 as in all other antiepileptic benzodiazepines), and it is rapidly effective--in a matter of hours or within a few days--against all varieties of epileptic seizures in 52% of subjects treated with it. Its effects are relatively mild. Unfortunately, its outstanding antiepileptic properties are exhausted after only a few weeks in one-third of all cases. The authors discuss the potential significance of this phenomenon, and stress the urgent need for intensive study of the basic mechanism governing exhaustion of the antiepileptic properties of the benzodiazepines in general and clobazam in particular.", 
    "34": "After 2 days of drug-free observation, 20 newly admitted psychotic patients received 20-35 mg of haloperidol intravenously and 20 patients received 30-40 mg of diazepam intravenously. Posttreatment ratings at 4 and 24 hours with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinical Global Impressions revealed significant improvement in both groups but no significant differences between the two treatments.", 
    "35": "Chlordiazepoxide and clidinium each, as a function of dose, prevent stress-induced gastric mucosal erosion in mice. Clidinium was 2.5 times more potent than chlordiazepoxide. When used in a combination of 2 parts chlordiazepoxide and 1 part clidinium, the protective effect was nearly five times greater than that produced by clidinium alone. Furthermore, the combination dosing proved nearly three times more potent than the potency that was predicted from simple additivity of the individual drug effects. This potentiation appears related to the number of ways in which the combination treatment can decrease autonomic input to the gastric mucosa. Thus, the peripheral cholinergic blockade by clidinium may be potentiated by a central chlordiazepoxide suppression of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. Therefore, the combined use of these drugs in the therapy of stress-induced gastric disorder appears to have a rational pharmacologic basis.", 
    "36": "The respiratory depressant effects of fentanyl, diazepam, and methohexital were studied in 18 patients who were breathing room air. Two patients had 70% oxygen supplementation administered by a nasal inhaler. Varying degrees of hypoxia occurred when the narcotic was given but hypoxia was not seen in patients who received diazepam alone. The hypoxic changes may be attributed to various physiological responses and can probably be prevented with administration of adequate oxygen.", 
    "37": "Cebus apella monkeys subjected to chronic haloperidol administration develop neurologic disturbances very similar to neuroleptic-induced acute dystonia human beings. After varying lengths of time, certain monkeys develop a prolonged dyskinetic syndrome resembling tardive dyskinesia (TD), as seen clinically. Two monkeys with signs of TD were given single intramuscular injections of various compounds with known effects on the catecholaminergic, cholinergic, serotoninergic and GABA-ergic neurotransmittor systems, and their effect on the TD signs were rated. Dopamine receptor blockers as well as cholinergics had an ameliorating effect on the symptoms. Some compounds known to activate the GABA system, including some benzodiazepines and the GABA-transaminase inhibitor amino-oxyacetic acid, also reduced the symptoms, as did the serotonin precursor L-5HTP. Results with serotonin antagonists were equivocal. It is concluded that dopamine receptor blockade, as well as increased activity within the GABA-ergic or cholinergic systems cause alleviation of TD. The findings are in agreement with earlier reports in man and thus seem to validate this primate model.", 
    "38": "The effects of cortically kindled seizure responses of procaine hydrochloride, diazepam and combinations of these two drugs were tested in this study. The cortex was stimulated until seizure responses developed past the focal stage (accompanied primarily by brief tonic convulsions) to the cortico-generalized stage (accompanied, typically, by an early brief tonus followed by a longer clonic seizure that is characteristic of subcortically triggered seizures). Diazepam was found to block the generalized component of the cortico-generalized electrographic and motor seizure leaving the tonus only slightly suppressed. Procaine blocked the tonus leaving the clonic seizure and discharge that is characteristic of the generalized response relatively intact. Combinations of half doses of the two drugs completely blocked all electrographic and motor seizure responses in about half the animals. The remaining animals had a very brief discharge with no convulsive responses.", 
    "39": "[3H]Flunitrazepam binding to rat brain homogenates was assayed in two ways: by 37-0 degrees C incubations or 0 degrees C only incubations. The affinity of brain benzodiazepine receptors for [3H]flunitrazepam was significantly greater in 37-0 degrees C incubated samples than in 0 degrees C incubated samples, while there was no change in the number of benzodiazepine receptors. The possible mechanisms for this enhanced binding affinity as well as the methodological implications for this observation are discussed.", 
    "40": "The cellular localisation of benzodiazepine receptors was studied. Kainic acid induced neuronal lesions (2 x 0.25-2 x 2 micrograms; 2-26 days in rat cerebellum decreased specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam down to 35% of controls. Specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam was also decreased (to 80% of controls) in the cerebllum of mutant nervous mouse (nr/nr) where Purkinje cells are degenerated but in the mutant weaver mouse where granule cells are degenerated. These results show that benzodiazepine receptors are located mainly on neurons; both on Purkinje cells and other neurons, but not to a great extent on granule cells.", 
    "41": "1. After intraperitoneal injection of rats with the new benzodiazepine (compound I), four metabolites (compounds II, III, IV and V) were found in the urine. 2. Compound II was identified as 7-bromo-5-(2'-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one by comparison of g.l.c. and mass spectral properties of the metabolite and synthetic compound. 3. Mass spectra of compound III and its acid hydrolysis products indicate that compound III contains a hydroxyl group in the C(5)-phenyl ring. 4. Compounds IV and V were identified by mass spectrometry as products of simultaneous aromatic hydroxylation and methoxylation of the diazepine I. 5. The major urinary excretion products are compounds III, IV and V. Only very small amounts of compounds I and II were detected.", 
    "42": "Repeated doses of a 1,5 benzodiazepine, clobazam, were administered to a group of consenting volunteers. Performance on a psychomotor performance task was not impaired by repeated doses of the drug. Subjective assessments of anxiety were reduced commensurate with an increase in the level of cortical integration, measured via critical flicker fusion thresholds, suggesting that the anxiolytic activity of the drug is related to its effect on arousal. Important differences were found between the responses of high and low anxiety subjects on objective measures of performance and arousal and on self-completion analogue rating scales.", 
    "43": "Dixyrazine (Esucos) as premedication for esophagogastroscopy was studied in a double-blind trial with diazepam and atropine in 321 successive endoscopies. It was established that dixyrazine was fairly well tolerated, regurgitation was significantly reduced. A distinct antiemetic effect was observed compared with diazepam; the difference was statistically significant in the male patients. Dixyrazine may be regarded as a fairly good alternative premedication for esophagogastroscopy.", 
    "44": "The estimation of the survival rate of tetanus-intoxicated mice is suggested to be a useful animal model for assaying the anti-tetanus potency of drugs. This model was tested with the four central depressants phenobarbitone, chlorpromazine, diazepam and halothane. In agreement with their clinical value, diazepam appeared to be the most, phenobarbitone the least effective agent.", 
    "45": "Drugs need not necessarily be administered directly to the neonate, but may reach the newborn infant as a result of drug administration to the mother during gestation, at parturition, or during the course of lactation. The processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs in the neonate are discussed. Differences between the neonate and the adult in this regard are outlined. The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of specific drugs to which the neonate may be exposed are discussed.", 
    "46": "The effect of stress during labor on the plasma concentration of cortisol, unconjugated estriol, and human chorionic somatomammotropin was studied in 15 healthy primiparous women. According to the method of pain relief the parturients were divided into two groups. One group was given continuous epidural analgesia and the other group received pethidine, diazepam, and nitrous oxide/oxygen in response to pain. In the most stressed nonepidural group there was a significant rise in the cortisol level during labor and the estriol concentration fell significantly. In the epidural group no significant changes were observed with respect to the concentration of either cortisol or estriol. These results give further support to the hypothesis that severe maternal stress may lead to a reduced concentration of estriol in maternal plasma."
