Aim of this literature review is to identify established risk factors for PD and to categorize them according timing of occurrence (pre, intra and post operative), and clinical impact (Odds ratio [OR], % increase in incidence of PD).", 
    "1": "medical literature databases (medline and embase) were searched for published manuscripts on \"postoperative delirium\". Predictors and preoperative risk factors for PD were categorized into 4 groups: demographics; co morbidities; surgery and anesthesia-related (age, education, laboratory anomalies, smoking habits, benzodiazepines premedication, cardiac and thoracic surgery, etc). Intra operative risk factors for PD were categorized into 2 groups: surgery and anesthesia-related (anemia, duration and type of surgery, selected opioid, intraoperative hypotension, etc). Post operative risk factors and precipitating factors include various pathophysiological and environmental conditions, (i.e., ICU admission, low cardiac output requiring inotropes infusion; new onset atrial fibrillation; persistent hypoxia or hypercarbia; use of narcotic analgesics, delayed ambulation, inadequate nutritional status; sensory deprivation, etc). In conclusion, the effective identification, prevention and treatment of pre, intra and postoperative risk factors are the cornerstones for the prevention of PD. A dedicated perioperative care path that encompasses a tailored selection of drugs used perioperatively, the appropriate anesthesia strategy, qualified nursing surveillance, systematic use of diagnostic tools and accurate staff communication reduces the incidence and clinical impact of PD.", 
    "2": "The present study sought to investigate the influence of subclinical sleep disturbances on driving practices and driver perceptions in a large cohort of healthy older drivers. Participants from the Candrive II prospective cohort study were investigated. Self-reported measures of sleep problems were used to determine the influence of sleep disturbance on self-reported driving practices and perceived driving abilities, as measured by the Situational Driving Frequency, Situational Driving Avoidance, and Perceived Driving Abilities scales. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to estimate whether mild self-reported sleep problems were predictive of driving restrictions and perceived abilities, while controlling for a variety of health-related factors and demographic variables known to mediate sleep problems or to impact driving. Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Candrive II study suggests that subclinical sleep problems do not significantly influence self-reported driving patterns or perceived driving abilities in older drivers once control variables are considered. The relationship between sleep problems, driving frequency, avoidance and perceived abilities is better explained by mediating demographic, health, and cognitive factors. Further research examining sleep disturbances and driving should include objective measures of driving practices (exposure, patterns) and outcomes (crashes, violations) and should take in consideration the severity of sleep problems.", 
    "3": "Aging is known to be associated with a high risk of developing seizure disorders. Currently, the mechanisms underlying this increased seizure susceptibility are not fully understood. Several previous studies have shown a loss of subgroups of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus of aged rodents, yet the network excitability intrinsic to the aged hippocampus remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study is to examine age-dependent changes of hippocampal network activities in young adult (3-5 months), aging (16-18 months), and aged (24-28 months) mice. We conducted intracranial electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in free-moving animals and extracellular recordings in hippocampal slices in vitro. EEG recordings revealed frequent spikes in aging and aged mice but only occasionally in young adults. These EEG spikes were suppressed following diazepam administration. Spontaneous field potentials with large amplitudes were frequently observed in hippocampal slices of aged mice but rarely in slices from young adults. These spontaneous field potentials originated from the CA3 area and their generation was dependent upon the excitatory glutamatergic activity. We therefore postulate that hippocampal network excitability is increased in aged mice and that such hyperactivity may be relevant to the increased seizure susceptibility observed in aged subjects.", 
    "4": "One of the major issues in clinical practice is the accurate differential diagnosis between mixed states and depression, often leading to inappropriate prescriptions of antidepressants in mixed states, and as a consequence, increasing the risk of manic switch and suicide. In order to better define the spectrum of mixed states, it may be useful to develop a dimensional approach. In this context, the MAThyS (Multidimensional Assessment of Thymic States) scale was built to assess activation/inhibition levels in all bipolar mood episodes, and to determine whether a clinical description in terms of activation/inhibition can help better define bipolar states with which both manic and depressive symptoms are associated. The aim of this paper is the validation of the MAThyS scale in 141 bipolar patients in acute states (manic, hypomanic, mixed, or depressive).",

However, many patients do not achieve, at the maximal tolerated dose, the recommended goals for low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB). Available agents combined with statins can provide additional LDL-C reduction, and agents in development will increase therapeutic options impacting also other atherogenic lipoprotein classes. In fact, genetic insights into mechanisms underlying regulation of LDL-C levels has expanded potential targets of drug therapy and led to the development of novel agents. Among them are modulators of apoB containing lipoproteins production and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 inhibitors. Alternative targets such as lipoprotein(a) also require attention; however, until we have a better understanding of these issues, further LDL-C lowering in high and very high-risk patients will represent the most sound clinical approach.",

The inferior olive shows a characteristic pseudohypertrophy secondary to brainstem lesions in the triangle of Mollaret and Guillain that interrupt dentato-olivary and tegmental pathways. We report a 35-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled hypertension who presented to the emergency department with PT after a left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. The diagnostic work-up consisted of brain MRI, which revealed restricted diffusion over the left frontoparietal lobes without involvement of the brainstem. During hospitalization, the patient reported two brief episodes of soft palate and base-of-the-tongue high-frequency, low-amplitude and rhythmic tremor that resolved after intravenous administration of lorazepam. A 2-hour video electroencephalogram showed no abnormalities. After initiation of levetiracetam therapy, no further spells were reported by the patient. At the 2-month follow-up, the patient had had no episodes of stereotypical PT or upper limb tremors since discharge. This report provides further evidence of the central role of the cortex in the generation of PT. The cortical origin of symptomatic palatal tremor (SPT) should be considered in patients presenting after an acute ischemic insult, particularly if there is no evidence of a brainstem lesion. Potential causes of SPT of cortical origin include focal epilepsy and diaschisis.",

A mixed-mode cation-exchange polymeric sorbent was used for SPE. Different extraction solvents or mixtures of solvents of different compositions for elution of the adsorbed analytes, and washing steps for eliminating interferences in the column were tested. Analytes were eluted from the column using 5% v/v NH4 OH in methanol. A derivatization step using different silylation reagents, time, and temperature was tested. Extracts from SPE were silylated by a mixture of N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, and subjected to gas chromatographic analysis. The LODs of 15 benzodiazepines in whole blood samples ranged from 0.24-0.62 ng mL(-1). The RSDs of samples used for three different quality control concentration levels were lower than 7.0%, and the accuracy ranged from 89.5 to 110.5%.

    "33": "GAB(A) (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) is abundantly expressed within the brain, and spinal cord pain circuits where it acts as the principal mediator of fast inhibitory neurotransmission. However, drugs that target GABA(A) receptor function such as the classical benzodiazepines have not been optimised to promote analgesia, are limited by side effects and are not routinely used for this purpose in humans. Compounds such as NS11394, L-838,417, HZ166 and TPA023 all bind to the same benzodiazepine site on the GABA(A) receptor to allosterically modulate receptor function and enhance the actions of GABA. By virtue of their ability to activate selected subtypes of GABA(A) receptors (principally those containing \u03b12, \u03b13 and \u03b15 subunits) these compounds have been shown to possess excellent tolerability profiles in animals. Importantly, a number of these molecules also mediate profound analgesia in animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Other modulators such as neurosteroids bind to distinct sites on GABA(A) receptor \u03b1 subunits, possess a unique pharmacology and are capable of targeting alternative GABA(A) receptor expressing populations. Moreover, neurosteroids also have pronounced analgesic actions in animal pain models. The continuing call for novel mechanism of action analgesics to target specific pathologies, especially in clinical neuropathic conditions, emphasizes the need to test modulators of GABA(A) receptor function in both human experimental pain models and pain patients.", 
    "34": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an important regulator of food digestion but its influence on small intestinal secretion has received little attention. We characterized effects of CCK-8, ghrelin and some related peptides on duodenal HCO3(-) secretion in vivo and demonstrated CCK-induced calcium signaling in acutely isolated enterocytes. A segment of proximal duodenum with intact blood supply was cannulated in situ in anaesthetized rats. Mucosal HCO3(-) secretion was continuously recorded (pH-stat). Peptides were administrated to the duodenum by close intra-arterial infusion. Clusters of duodenal enterocytes were attached to the bottom of a perfusion chamber. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) was examined by dual-wavelength imaging. CCK-8 (3.0, 15 and 60 pmol/kg,h) caused dose-dependent increases (p<0.01) in duodenal alkaline secretion in both overnight fasted and continuously fed animals. The CCK1R-antagonist devazepide but neither the CCK2R-antagonist YMM022 nor the melatonin MT2-selective antagonist luzindole inhibited the rise in secretion. Atropine decreased sensitivity to CCK-8. The appetite-related peptide ghrelin was without effect on the duodenal secretion in fasted as well as fed animals. Superfusion with CCK-8 (1.0-50 nM) induced [Ca(2+)]i signaling in acutely isolated duodenal enterocytes. After an initial peak response, [Ca(2+)]i returned to near basal values within 3-5min. Devazepide but not YMM022 inhibited this [Ca(2+)]i response. Low doses of CCK-8 stimulate duodenal alkaline secretion and induce enterocyte [Ca(2+)]i signaling by an action at CCK1 receptors. The results point to importance of CCK in the rapid postprandial rise in mucosa-protective duodenal secretion.", 
    "35": "The relevance of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) in the mediation of anxiety-related defensive responses has long been acknowledged. Whereas strong evidence supports that activation of the latter receptors provokes anxiety, conflicting findings have been reported on the role played by the former binding site. In this study we further investigated the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1A-Rs) in the regulation of anxiety- and panic-related defensive behaviors. The results showed that intra-BLA injection of the 5-HT1A-R agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.4-16nmol) in male Wistar rats impaired the acquisition of inhibitory avoidance in the elevated T-maze, increased the percentage of time spent in the lit compartment of the light-dark transition model and enhanced the number of punished drinking events in the Vogel conflict test, all changes compatible with an anxiolytic effect. This agonist also impaired escape expression in the elevated T-maze, suggestive of a panicolytic-like effect. 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes in the elevated T-maze and light-dark tests were blocked by previous local administration of the 5-HT1A-R antagonist WAY-100635 (0.37nmol) and were also observed after intra-BLA microinjection of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (10-40nmol). Thus, stimulation of 5-HT1A-Rs in the BLA causes both anxiolytic- and panicolytic-like effects, what may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of generalized anxiety and panic disorders.",

Data were hand recorded in situ by an observer and through a camcorder by computer software.", 
    "38": "Results showed that CLZ and MPH had an anxiogenic effect at the two highest doses. Only CLZ at 2.5mg/kg reduced the anxiety-like levels of mice. Moreover, PTX exerted an anxiogenic effect in mice only at 2mg/kg. The drugs affecting the anxiety-like levels also affected the activity levels. Thus, the differences might have been mediated by changes in activity levels.", 
    "39": "Globally, these data demonstrate that the results obtained from the zero maze test are difficult to interpret when the C57BL/6J strain is used. On the other hand, high doses of substances that interact with the GABAergic system, as CLZ, can produce sedation in these mice. In contrast, high doses of GABAA antagonists, as PTX, are necessary if anxiogenic effects should be observed. Further investigations with this strain are necessary in order to corroborate the results of the present study.",

    "50": "The HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein, a domain of Gag, which participates in formation of both the mature and immature capsid, represents a potential target for anti-viral drug development. Characterization of hits obtained via high-throughput screening of an in vitro capsid assembly assay led to multiple compounds having this potential. We previously presented the characterization of two inhibitor series that bind the N-terminal domain of the capsid (CA(NTD)), at a site located at the bottom of its helical bundle, often referred to as the CAP-1 binding site. In this work we characterize a novel series of benzimidazole hits. Initial optimization of this series led to compounds with improved in vitro assembly and anti-viral activity. Using NMR spectroscopy we found that this series binds to a unique site on CA(NTD), located at the apex of the helical bundle, well removed from previously characterized binding sites for CA inhibitors. 2D (1)H-(15)N HSQC and (19)F NMR showed that binding of the benzimidazoles to this distinct site does not affect the binding of either cyclophilin A (CypA) to the CypA-binding loop or a benzodiazepine-based CA assembly inhibitor to the CAP-1 site. Unfortunately, while compounds of this series achieved promising in vitro assembly and anti-viral effects, they also were found to be quite sensitive to a number of naturally occurring CA(NTD) polymorphisms observed among clinical isolates. Despite the negative impact of this finding for drug development, the discovery of multiple inhibitor binding sites on CA(NTD) shows that capsid assembly is much more complex than previously realized.",

These findings led us to determine whether variation in the CHRM4 gene sequence was associated with an altered risk of schizophrenia by sequencing the CHRM4 gene from the brains of 76 people with the disorder and 74 people with no history of psychiatric disorders. In addition, because the CHRM4 is a potential target for antipsychotic drug development, we investigated whether variations in CHRM4 sequence were associated with final recorded doses of, and life-time exposure to, antipsychotic drugs. Gene sequencing identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs2067482 and rs72910092) in the CHRM4 gene. For rs2067482, our data suggested that both genotype (1341C/C; p = 0.05) and allele (C; p = 0.03) were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. In addition, there was a strong trend (p = 0.08) towards an association between CHRM4 sequence and increased lifetime exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Furthermore, there was a trend for people with the C allele to be prescribed benzodiazepines more frequently (p = 0.06) than those with the T allele. These data, albeit on small cohorts, are consistent with genetic variance at rs2067482 contributing to an altered risk of developing schizophrenia which requires more forceful pharmacotherapy to achieve a clinical response.",

An implicit assumption has been that there is no \"cross talk\" between signals of the internal standard and the target analyte. In some cases, however, naturally occurring isotopes of the analyte do contribute to the signal of the internal standard. This phenomenon becomes more pronounced for isotopically rich compounds, such as those containing sulfur, chlorine, or bromine, higher molecular weight compounds, and those at high analyte/internal standard concentration ratio. This can create nonlinear calibration behavior that may bias quantitative results. Here, we propose the use of a nonlinear but more accurate fitting of data for these situations that incorporates one or two constants determined experimentally for each analyte/internal standard combination and an adjustable calibration parameter. This fitting provides more accurate quantitation in MS-based assays where contributions from analyte to stable labeled internal standard signal exist. It can also correct for the reverse situation where an analyte is present in the internal standard as an impurity. The practical utility of this approach is described, and by using experimental data, the approach is compared to alternative fits.",

However, diazepam increased mortality and bacterial load from S. pneumoniae pneumonia. The increases in mortality and bacterial load were reversed by a GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, indicating dependence on GABAA receptor signaling. While cell recruitment was unaltered by diazepam, the cytokine response to infection was affected, suggesting that local responses to the pathogen were perturbed. Macrophage and monocytes expressed benzodiazepine sensitive (\u03b11-\u03b32) GABAA receptors. Interestingly macrophage GABAA receptor expression was regulated by bacterial toll-like receptor agonists and cytokines indicating an endogenous role in the immune response. Functionally diazepam appeared to counteract the endogenous down-regulation of GABAA signaling during infection. Consistent with augmented GABAA signaling, diazepam provoked intracellular acidosis in macrophage, leading to impaired cytokine production, bacterial phagocytosis and killing.

Assay calibration (human plasma, oral fluid, and haemolysed whole blood calibration solutions) was performed by plotting the ratio of the peak area of the analyte to that of the appropriate internal standard. Assay validation was as per FDA guidelines. Assay calibration was linear across the concentration ranges studied. Inter- and intra-assay precision and accuracy were within 10% for all analytes in human plasma. Similar results were obtained for oral fluid and haemolysed whole blood, except that aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were within 15% accuracy at low concentration (15 \u03bcg/L) in oral fluid, and olanzapine inter-assay precision could not be assessed in these matrices due to day-by-day degradation of this analyte. Recoveries varied between 16% (sulpiride) and 107% (clozapine), and were reproducible as well as comparable between human plasma, human serum, calf serum and haemolysed whole blood. For oral fluid, recoveries were reproducible, but differed slightly from those in plasma suggesting the need for calibration solutions to be prepared in this medium if oral fluid is to be analysed. LLOQs were 1-5 \u03bcg/L depending on the analyte. Neither ion suppression/enhancement, nor interference from some known metabolites of the antipsychotics studied has been encountered.

Enhanced glutamatergic neurotransmission leads to SE, and AMPA receptors are modified during SE. Reducing glutamate release during SE is a potential approach to terminate SE. The neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) is proposed to diminish presynaptic glutamate release by activating SST type-2 receptors (SST2R). SST exerts an anticonvulsant action in some experimental models of seizures. Here, we investigated the mechanism of action of SST on excitatory synaptic transmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses and the ability of SST to treat SE in rats using patch-clamp electrophysiology and video-EEG monitoring of seizures. SST reduced action potential-dependent EPSCs (sEPSCs) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses at concentrations up to 1\u03bcM; higher concentrations had no effect or increased the sEPSC frequency. SST also prevented paired-pulse facilitation of evoked EPSCs and did not alter action-potential-independent miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). The effect of SST on EPSCs was inhibited by the SST2R antagonist cyanamid-154806 and was mimicked by the SST2R agonists, octreotide and lanreotide. Both SST and octreotide reduced the firing rate of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Intraventricular administration of SST, within a range of doses, either prevented or attenuated pilocarpine-induced SE or delayed the median time to the first grade 5 seizure by 11min. Similarly, octreotide or lanreotide prevented or attenuated SE in more than 65% of animals. Compared to the pilocarpine model, octreotide was highly potent in preventing or attenuating continuous hippocampal stimulation-induced SE in all animals within 60min of SE onset. Our results demonstrate that SST, through the activation of SST2Rs, diminishes presynaptic glutamate release and attenuates SE.",

However, continuous IV infusion of physostigmine is rarely used due to concern for cardiotoxicity and signs of cholinergic excess such as seizures, nausea, and vomiting. We report the successful use of continuous IV physostigmine in a 6-year-old boy with anticholinergic delirium. A 6-year-old, 30-kg boy with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ingested 15-20 olanzapine (5 mg) tablets. He was agitated and was treated with lorazepam at a local hospital. His heart rate was 148 beats per min; respiratory rate, 32 breaths per minute; blood pressure, 111/70 mmHg; temperature, 96.8\u00b0F, and O2 saturation of 98% on room air. His pupils were 5-6 mm, and his skin was warm and initially flushed. Blood chemistry results were normal. A 12-lead ECG showed sinus tachycardia with normal QRS and QT intervals. The agitation worsened and did not respond to benzodiazepines. The patient was then given a dose of 0.6 mg physostigmine (0.02 mg/kg) intravenously with reversal of the agitation. But the effect only lasted 45 min requiring administration of a second bolus of 0.6 mg (0.02 mg/kg). A physostigmine intravenous infusion was administered at a rate of 0.5 mg/h (0.0167 mg/kg/h). Overnight, the patient became more agitated. The physostigmine was discontinued, and IV dexmedetomidine (0.2 \u03bcg/kg/h) was started at 21:00. The patient became over-sedated with pinpoint pupils resulting in discontinuation of the dexmedetomidine at 04:00. The patient again became agitated and developed visual hallucinations. Three 1-mg (0.03 mg/kg) boluses of physostigmine were administered over 45 min, and the physostigmine infusion was restarted at a rate of 1 mg/h (0.03 mg/kg/h) for 16.5 h. He received 19.5 mg of physostigmine with no return of anticholinergic symptoms and no signs of cholinergic excess except for a tremor that resolved when the infusion was stopped. He was discharged home without further sequelae. There are few publications describing a continuous infusion of physostigmine to reverse anticholinergic delirium. Our patient received a total dose of 25.5 mg with complete resolution of symptoms.

In the present study, male ICR (Imprinting Control Region) mice were injected with pilocarpine to induce acute seizures. SE was terminated by diazepam at 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 4 h after seizure onset. Spontaneous seizures occurred in the 1, 2 and 4 h SE groups, and the seizure frequency increased with the prolongation of SE. Similarly, the Morris water maze revealed that the escape latency was significantly increased and the number of target quadrant crossings was markedly decreased in the 1, 2 and 4 h SE groups. Robust mossy fiber sprouting was observed in these groups, but not in the 10 or 30 min group. In contrast, Fluoro-Jade B staining revealed significant cell death only in the 4 h SE group. The incidence and frequency of spontaneous seizures were correlated with Timm score (P = 0.004) and escape latency (P = 0.004).

However, no studies have yet assessed the defensive behaviour repertoire of animals in this modified test. In Experiment 1, factor analysis was employed to characterise the behavioural profile of mice exposed to the oEPM. Experiments 2 and 3 assessed the effects of acute alprazolam (0.5-1.5mg/kg; diazepam 0.5-1.5mg/kg), pentylenetetrazole (10.0-30.0mg/kg), yohimbine (2.0-6.0mg/kg), mCPP (0.3-3.0mg/kg), and acute and chronic fluoxetine (10.0-30.0mg/kg) and imipramine (1.0-15.0mg/kg) on behaviours identified in Experiment 1. The factor analyses revealed that behaviour in the oEPM can largely (77% total variance) be accounted for in terms of 3 factors: factor 1 ('depth exploration'; e.g. head-dipping on the arms), factor 2 ('cautious exploration of arms'; e.g. flatback approach), and factor 3 ('risk assessment'; stretched attend postures - SAP). Experiments 2 and 3 showed that, over the dose range used, alprazolam selectively attenuated all measures of defensiveness. Similar, though more modest, effects were seen with diazepam. Confirming the intensity of the emotional response to the oEPM (nociceptive, endocrine and behavioural), relatively few significant behavioural changes were seen in response to the anxiogenic compounds tested. Although acute fluoxetine or imipramine treatment failed to modify behaviour in the oEPM, chronic fluoxetine (but not chronic imipramine) attenuated total flat back approach and increased head dipping outside the central square. Together, the results indicate that the oEPM induces behavioural defensive responses that are sensitive to alprazolam and chronic fluoxetine.",

With more patients now surviving intensive care, more patients are suffering from these negative health consequences. A review of recent research on the subject suggests that more novel, non-benzodiazepine agents such as dexmedetomidine, fluorinated ether gases, and remifentanil function effectively as sedative agents in intubated patients in the intensive care unit, and are less likely to lead to delirium, agitation, aggression, psychosis, and other complications; in addition, use of these alternatives is associated with shorter times to awakening, extubation, and ICU discharge, as well as shorter overall length of stay and decreased cost of care.",

    "172": "The precise temporal and spatial activity patterns of neurons in cortical networks are organized by different state-dependent types of network oscillations. GABAergic inhibition plays a key role in the underlying mechanisms of such oscillations and it has been suggested that the duration of widely distributed phasic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) determines the frequency of the resulting network oscillation. Here, we test this hypothesis in an in vitro model of sharp wave-ripple (SPW-R) complexes, a particularly fast pattern of network oscillations at \u223c200 Hz which is involved in memory consolidation. We recorded SPW-R in mouse hippocampal slices in the absence and presence of NCC-711, an inhibitor of GABA uptake. The resulting prolongation of IPSP resulted in reduced occurrence of SPW-R, whereas the superimposed fast oscillations as well as the precision of rhythmic cell synchronization remained stable. Application of Diazepam which is a positive modulator of the GABAA receptor led to consistent results. We conclude that phasic inhibition is a major regulator of network excitability in CA3 (where SPW-Rs are generated), but does not set the frequency of hippocampal ripples.",

Although a common hallmark of DON-induced toxicity is the rapid onset of emesis, the mechanisms for this adverse effect are not fully understood. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that the mink (Neovison vison) is a suitable small animal model for investigating trichothecene-induced emesis. The goal of this study was to use this model to determine the roles of two gut satiety hormones, peptide YY3-36 (PYY3-36) and cholecystokinin (CCK), and the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in DON-induced emesis. Following ip exposure to DON at 0.1 and 0.25mg/kg bw, emesis induction ensued within 15-30min and then persisted up to 120min. Plasma DON measurement revealed that this emesis period correlated with the rapid distribution and clearance of the toxin. Significant elevations in both plasma PYY3-36 (30-60min) and 5-HT (60min) but not CCK were observed during emesis. Pretreatment with the neuropeptide Y2 receptor antagonist JNJ-31020028 attenuated DON- and PYY-induced emesis, whereas the CCK1 receptor antagonist devezapide did not alter DON's emetic effects. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron completely suppressed induction of vomiting by DON and the 5-HT inducer cisplatin. Granisetron pretreatment also partially blocked PYY3-36-induced emesis, suggesting a potential upstream role for this gut satiety hormone in 5-HT release. Taken together, the results suggest that both PYY3-36 and 5-HT play contributory roles in DON-induced emesis.", 
    "176": "Despite their improved pharmacokinetic profile, the Z-drugs, zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon, have a spectrum of adverse effects comparable to benzodiazepines. This review focuses on the impairment from Z-drugs on cognition, behavior, psychomotor performance, and driving ability. Z-drugs are short-acting GABA agonists that reduce sleep latency without disturbing sleep architecture. Bizarre behavioral effects have prompted warnings on the prescription, dispensation, and use of Z-drugs. Psychomotor impairment, falls, and hip fractures are more likely to occur with Z-drugs that have longer half-lives, that are taken at higher-than-recommended doses and when mixed with other psychoactive substances including alcohol. Zopiclone and higher doses of zolpidem are more likely to cause anterograde amnesia than zaleplon. Z-drugs, especially zolpidem, are associated with complex behaviors such as sleepwalking, sleep-driving, and hallucinations. Patients taking zopiclone and zolpidem have an increased risk of motor vehicle collisions, over double that of unexposed drivers. Driving impairment occurs with zopiclone and higher doses of zolpidem but is unlikely to occur after 4\u00a0h post-zaleplon administration. The residual effect of Z-drugs on next-day cognitive and psychomotor performance has significant impact on lifestyle, safety, and occupational considerations, including motor vehicle and machine operation. The risk-benefit analysis of Z-drugs in the treatment of insomnia, particularly in the elderly, may not favor treatment due to the increased risks of falls and motor vehicle collisions. Prescribers should warn patients taking Z-drugs of minimum time thresholds before they operate machinery or drive motor vehicles.", 
    "177": "Phenol compounds, such as propofol and thymol, have been shown to act on the GABAA receptor through interaction with specific sites of this receptor. In addition, considering the high lipophilicity of phenols, it is possible that their pharmacological activity may also be the result of the interaction of phenol molecules with the surrounding lipid molecules, modulating the supramolecular organization of the receptor environment. Thus, in the present study, we study the pharmacological activity of some propofol- and thymol-related phenols on the native GABAA receptor using primary cultures of cortical neurons and investigate the effects of these compounds on the micro viscosity of artificial membranes by means of fluorescence anisotropy. The phenol compounds analyzed in this article are carvacrol, chlorothymol, and eugenol. All compounds were able to enhance the binding of [(3)H]flunitrazepam with EC50 values in the micromolar range and to increase the GABA-evoked Cl(-) influx in a concentration-dependent manner, both effects being inhibited by the competitive GABAA antagonist bicuculline. These results strongly suggest that the phenols studied are positive allosteric modulators of this receptor. Chlorothymol showed a bell-type effect, reducing its positive effect at concentrations >100\u00a0\u03bcM. The concentrations necessary to induce positive allosteric modulation of GABAA receptor were not cytotoxic. Although all compounds were able to decrease the micro viscosity of artificial membranes, chlorothymol displayed a larger effect which could explain its effects on [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding and on cell viability at high concentrations. Finally, it is suggested that these compounds may exert depressant activity on the central nervous system and potentiate the effects of general anesthetics.", 
    "178": "The present study seeks to evaluate the sedative and anxiolytic effects of the 70% ethanol extract of Sinomeni Caulis et Rhizoma (SR). The extract was orally administered to mice at dosages of 25, 50, 100, 200 or 400 mg/kg. The mice were then subjected to an array of behavioral tests to assess the sedative (open-field, rota-rod, and thiopental sodium-induced sleeping test) and anxiolytic (elevated plus maze test) effects of the substance. SR (100, 200 mg/kg) significantly reduced locomotor activity, decreased rota-rod performance, and potentiated thiopental sodium-induced sleeping in mice, all indicative of its sedative effects. SR (50, 100 mg/kg) also produced anxiolytic effects, as shown by an increase in entries and staying time on the open arm of the plus maze. SR's sedative and anxiolytic effects were comparable to that of the benzodiazepine, diazepam. Moreover, to identify SR's probable mechanism of action, intracellular Cl\u207b ion influx was observed in cultured human neuroblastoma cells. SR dose-dependently increased Cl\u207b influx, which was blocked by co-administration of the GABAA receptor competitive antagonist, bicuculline. Among the major constituents of SR, only magnoflorine showed a similar increment in Cl\u207b influx, which was also blocked by bicuculline. Altogether, the present results suggest that SR has sedative and anxiolytic effects, probably mediated by magnoflorine through a GABAergic mechanism of action.",

A final sample of 79 patients randomized to haloperidol (N\u2009=\u200928), olanzapine (N\u2009=\u200923), or risperidone (N\u2009=\u200928) who completed clinical and cognitive evaluations at baseline and 3-year follow-up was included in the final analysis. Forty-one healthy individuals were also included in the final analysis. The main outcome measure was cognitive changes at 3-year follow-up. Due to the fact that some of the patients had switched their initially prescribed antipsychotic medication during the course of the study (6 out of 28 in haloperidol group, 18 out of 23 in olanzapine group, and 24 out of 28 in risperidone group continued with the initial study drug at 3-year assessment), we have also conducted a per protocol analysis.",

The better performance observed on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and Digit Symbol in olanzapine treatment group was likely explained by the lower prevalence of use of antimuscarinic drugs. These results were essentially similar to those found in the intention-to-treat analysis.", 
    "182": "The major conclusion of this study is that haloperidol, olanzapine, and risperidone have not demonstrated substantial neurocognitive effectiveness, improving cognitive deficits present in the early phases of the illness.

    "183": "Chk1 is implicated in several checkpoints of the cell cycle acting as a key player in the signal transduction pathway activated in response to DNA damage and crucial for the maintenance of genomic stability. Chk1 also plays a role in the mitotic spindle checkpoint, which ensures the fidelity of mitotic segregation during mitosis, preventing chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. Mad2 is one of the main mitotic checkpoint components and also exerts a role in the cellular response to DNA damage. To investigate a possible crosslink existing between Chk1 and Mad2, we studied Mad2 protein levels after Chk1 inhibition either by specific siRNAs or by a specific and selective Chk1 inhibitor (PF-00477736), and we found that after Chk1 inhibition, Mad2 protein levels decrease only in tumor cells sensitive to Chk1 depletion. We then mapped six Chk1's phosphorylatable sites on Mad2 protein, and found that Chk1 is able to phosphorylate Mad2 in vitro on more than one site, while it is incapable of phoshorylating the Mad2 form mutated on all six phosphorylatable sites. Moreover our studies demonstrate that Chk1 co-localizes and physically associates with Mad2 in cells both under unstressed conditions and after DNA damage, thus providing new and interesting evidence on Chk1 and Mad2 crosstalk in the DNA damage checkpoint and in the mitotic spindle checkpoint.", 
    "184": "Co-encapsulation of drugs directed at commonly associated diseases provides a convenient means for administration, especially if transdermally delivered. In this work, a comprehensive study for the co-encapsulation of drugs with a differential lipophilicity, olanzapine and simvastatin, and their transdermal delivery in a formulation containing nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) is presented. Focus is given to the evaluation of a strategy in which NLC and chemical permeation enhancers are combined. It comprises in vitro, in silico and cellular viability approaches. The optimization and rationalization of the systems are carried out using a two-step factorial design. It is shown that the external medium in the NLC dispersion strongly influences permeation. It is also seen that the use of NLC determines a synergistic effect with selected permeation enhancers, thus promoting marked flux enhancement ratios (48 and 21, respectively for olanzapine and simvastatin) relative to the drugs in solution. The developed formulations can be considered non-irritant. A correlation between enhancer positioning in a lipid bilayer, partially governed by a H-bonding phenomenon, and enhancement effect is suggested from molecular dynamics studies and experimental observations.",

Chloroform and methanol were used as extractant and disperser solvents, respectively. The influence of several variables (e.g., type and volume of dispersant and extraction solvents, pH, ultrasonic time and ionic strength) was carefully evaluated and optimized, using an asymmetric screening design 3(2)4(2)//16. Analysis of extracts was performed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detection (UPLC-PDA). Under the optimum conditions, two reversed-phases, Shield RP18 and C18 columns were successfully tested, obtaining good linearity in a range of 0.01-5\u03bcgmL(-1), with correlation coefficients r>0.996. Quantification limits ranged between 4.3-13.2ngmL(-1) and 4.0-14.8ngmL(-1), were obtained for C18 and Shield RP18 columns, respectively. The optimized method exhibited a good precision level, with relative standard deviation values lower than 8%. The recoveries studied at two spiked levels, ranged from 71 to 102% for all considered compounds. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of seven benzodiazepines in real human plasma samples.",

    "191": "During brain development, many factors influence the assembly and final positioning of cortical neurons, and this process is essential for proper circuit formation and normal brain function. Among many important extrinsic factors that guide the maturation of embryonic cortical neurons, the secreted neurotransmitter GABA has been proposed to influence both their migratory behaviour and their terminal differentiation. The full extent of the short-term and long-term changes in brain patterning and function caused by modulators of the GABA system is not known. In this study, we specifically investigated whether diazepam, a commonly used benzodiazepine that modulates the GABAA receptor, alters neuronal positioning in vivo, and whether this can lead to lasting effects on brain function. We found that fetal exposure to diazepam did not change cell positioning within the embryonic day (E)14.5 mouse cerebral cortex, but significantly altered neuron positioning within the E18.5 cortex. In adult mice, diazepam treatment affected the distribution of cortical interneurons that express parvalbumin or calretinin, and also led to a decrease in the numbers of calretinin-expressing interneurons. In addition, we observed that neonatal exposure to diazepam altered the sensitivity of mice to a proconvulsant challenge. Therefore, exposure of the fetal brain to benzodiazepines has consequences for the positioning of neurons and cortical network excitability.", 
    "192": "Experimental models of depression often entail exposing a rodent to a stressor and subsequently characterizing changes in learning and anhedonia, which may reflect symptoms of human depression. Importantly, not all people, and not all laboratory rats, exposed to stressors develop depressed behavior; these \"resilient\" individuals are the focus of our review. Herein we describe research from the \"learned helplessness\" and \"intermittent swim stress\" (ISS) models of depression in which rats that were allowed to control the offset of the aversive stimulus with a behavioral response, and in a subset of rats that were not allowed to control the stressor that appeared to be behaviorally and neurochemically similar to rats that were either naive to stress or had controllability over the stressor. For example, rats exposed to inescapable tailshock, but do not develop learned helplessness, exhibit altered sensitivity to the behavioral effects of GABAA receptor antagonists and reduced in vitro benzodiazepine receptor ligand binding. This pattern suggested that resilience might involve activation of an endogenous benzodiazepine-like compound, possibly an allostatic modulator of the GABAA receptor like allopregnanolone. From the ISS model, we have observed in resilient rats protection from stressor-induced glucocorticoid increases and immune activation. In order to identify the neural mediators of these correlates of resilience, non-invasive measures are needed to predict the resilient or vulnerable phenotype prior to analysis of neural endpoints. To this end, we found that ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) appear to predict the resilient phenotype in the ISS paradigm. We propose that combining non-invasive predictive measures, such as USVs with biological endpoint measures, will facilitate future research into the neural correlates of resilience.",

It is important to explore the longitudinal alterations in white-matter (WM) microstructure in antipsychotic-naive patients with first-episode schizophrenia during the very early phase of treatment when relatively 'free' from chronicity.", 
    "226": "Thirty-five patients with first-episode schizophrenia and 22 healthy volunteers were recruited. High-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was obtained from participants at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. A 'difference map' for each individual was calculated from the 6-week follow-up fractional anisotropy (FA) of DTI minus the baseline FA. Differences in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores between baseline and 6 weeks were also evaluated and expressed as a 6-week/baseline ratio.", 
    "227": "Compared to healthy controls, there was a significant decrease in absolute FA of WM around the bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus and the right anterior corona radiata of the frontal lobe in first-episode drug-naive patients with schizophrenia following 6 weeks of treatment. Clinical symptoms improved during this period but the change in FA did not correlate with the changes in clinical symptoms or the dose of antipsychotic medication.", 
    "228": "During the early phase of treatment, there is an acute reduction in WM FA that may be due to the effects of antipsychotic medications. However, it is not possible to entirely exclude the effects of underlying progression of illness.", 
    "229": "Cpe(fat/fat) mice have a point mutation in carboxypeptidase E (Cpe), an exopeptidase that removes C-terminal basic amino acids from intermediates to produce bioactive peptides. The mutation renders the enzyme inactive and unstable. The absence of Cpe activity in these mutants leads to abnormal processing of many peptides, with elevated levels of intermediates and greatly reduced levels of the mature peptides. Cpe(fat/fat) mice develop obesity, diabetes and infertility in adulthood. We examined whether anxiety- and/or depressive-like behaviours are also present. Anxiety-like responses are not evident in young Cpe(fat/fat) mice (\u223c60 d), but appear in older animals (>90 d). These behaviours are reversed by acute treatment with diazepam or fluoxetine. In contrast, increased immobilities in forced swim and tail suspension are evident in all age groups examined. These behaviours are reversed by acute administration of reboxetine. In comparison acute treatments with fluoxetine or bupropion are ineffective; however, immobility times are normalized with 2 wk treatment. These data demonstrate that Cpe(fat/fat) mice display depressive-like responses aged \u223c60 d, whereas anxiety-like behaviours emerge \u223c1 month later. In tail suspension, the reboxetine findings show that noradrenergic actions of antidepressants are intact in Cpe(fat/fat) mice. The ability of acute fluoxetine treatment to rescue anxiety-like while leaving depressive-like responses unaffected suggests that serotonin mechanisms underlying these behaviours are different. Since depressive-like responses in the Cpe(fat/fat) mice are rescued by 2 wk, but not acute, treatment with fluoxetine or bupropion, these mice may serve as a useful model that resembles human depression.", 
    "230": "One-pot and efficient syntheses of structurally diverse isoquinolin-3-ones and isoquinolin-3-one-based benzo-1,4-diazepin-2,5-diones have been developed. The notable features of the process include the Ugi condensation of monomasked phthalaldehydes with amines, carboxylic acids, and isonitriles, followed by HClO4-mediated intramolecular condensation of the carbonyl with amide."
